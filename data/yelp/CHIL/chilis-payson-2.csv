Anthony A.,"Chandler, AZ",24,5,5,4.0,8/19/2017,Welcome rest after a ride to get out of the Phoenix heat. Why not a stacked Southwestern Burger with onion rings and bacon...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Ben B.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,92,5,1.0,6/25/2017,"Greasy, cold chips served 20 minutes after I got there. Bartender was running the bar and tables, had no time for the bar which caused her to forget my water and the order of fresh guacamole. Drink sitting empty for over 10 minutes, I called Chilis from their bar. I'd like a bartender out here, please. She was gone. He came out a few minutes later, I asked for drink refills, he called the bartender over (instead of doing it himself) and disappeared again. No apology, apparently status quo for this Chili's, no thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Bea M.,"Pinal County, AZ",0,11,,5.0,8/17/2017,Great dinner with fine service and delicious food.  A $10.00 off coupon made the visit even more attractive.  Ribs were tender and juicy.  Chicken fajitas were tasty with a huge portion.  Took 1/2 the serving home.  Very nice dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Lauren A.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,212,139,4.0,10/17/2015,"Chilies are all pretty much the same with a similar look and feel, and of course the same menus. That's ok because you know what you are getting. We stopped for lunch on a recent trip to Payson. I had the grilled chicken sandwich, my husband had the chicken enchiladas and our son had the kids pizza. The food was decent and it was served quickly. Our waiter went in for the hard sell with appetizers and additional cost options which got annoying quick but we stuck to our guns and ordered only what we wanted. No one wanted to drive home to Phoenix stuffed from way too big a lunch. I like their little kiosk on the table that lets you pay when you are ready without waiting for the waiter. We belong to the club and were able to use our points to reduce our total bill from $29 to $19... What a deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Dallas T.,"Mesa, AZ",0,4,4,5.0,9/3/2017,Our family after a long day of fun wanted to go out to dinner. We have 5 small children and the environment was great. Everything was clean and friendly. The food was fantastic. Our waitress - Destiny- was amazing. She loves people so well and made us feel right at home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Don N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",52,513,453,4.0,11/12/2016,"We were driving a different way because of a 24 car pile up on the interstate when we found this place.   It was pretty busy that night, but they seated us very quickly.   The four of us had different items, and they forgot one item, so the server gave us the item for free!   Everyone's food was tasty and the server always came back to refill our drinks and to see how everything was.   We gave him a good tip!!   I had the fajitas... not bad!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Brianne P.,"El Mirage, AZ",6,34,9,5.0,1/15/2017,Had fun there last night! Lacey was our amazing bartender! Sweet and funny and gave us great service! We will definitely be back when we visit Payson again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Maria P.,"Payson, AZ",0,37,,1.0,9/18/2016,"This Chilis has gone down hill and is getting worse. We ate there last night with friends. It was maybe half full, we had an hour before our movie started. That should have been plenty of time to order, get our food, & get to the movie just behind the restaurant in plenty of time. We arrived after the movie started. The server was attentive, the kitchen was slow.  Our food was terrible. One person got a dry over cooked hamburger, another chicken so spicy she who loves spicy food could not eat it. I ordered a medium sirloin steak with mashed potatoes; I got a medium-well to well done rubbery steak with skillet mashed potatoes. This morning my mouth tasted salty. I looked up the nutritional values of my meal. My steak had over 3100 grams of sodium. There is one reason restaurants use large amounts of salt; to improve the taste of their low quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Justin M.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,23,1,1.0,7/24/2016,"Walk in and the hostess tells us we will have to wait for our party of 5 even though the place is half empty and there are 2 tables that hold 8 people.  So i say ""you'd rather make my family stand than sit us at a table that hold 8 even when 2 are open?""  She says would you like to speak to the manager?  We said no thanks we'll leave.  Ill never walk through those doors again. Probably the most un welcome i have ever felt in a place that serves the public.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Terri D.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",0,12,5,1.0,7/19/2016,My husband had food poisoning! it upsets me that chili's has not responded to us or any of the other reviews! we don't want anything but some sign that they give a crap!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
D Q.,"Flagstaff, AZ",7,190,94,4.0,8/31/2014,"Ordered the fajitas trio, double checked with server there's enough for two considering they serve this dish in a couple different combos. We thought our order would feed two of us, based on the menu photo, but when we got it it was just enough for one. The manager doubled up or order and took very good care of us once we mentioned or concern. Very nice manager very professional. Server should have known we needed more and warned us but she didn't seem to know or have the proper training on that dish. Glad the manager was on top of things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Chris S.,"Tempe, AZ",298,569,1415,3.0,6/25/2014,"This is a mixed review, because while I found a dead cockroach in the bathroom, our to-go orders were excellent. I brought it up to others in my party but they assured me it was okay since it was in the bathroom. Still, not the most appetizing thing you want to see before you eat a meal. Don't they clean these restrooms often? We placed orders for three steaks, and one cheeseburger at their take-out counter. The service was very friendly and we sat and had some drinks at the bar while we waited. We were taking these orders to Pine but they were packaged so well, they were still hot. I've only been to Chili's once, but everyone would not shut up about their steaks and how tender they were. I see this as a great place to catch a meal and then watch a movie at the Sawmill right behind the restaurant in this small town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Felicia W.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,54,3,4.0,2/15/2015,Considering this is their biggest restaurant in town it's decent. Typical food and service to be expected at Chilis.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Margaret D.,"San Diego, CA",823,730,90,3.0,8/18/2013,"Friendly staff, kind of slow. Food was okay. The specials menu was kind of confusing. My husband and I both got the turkey sandwich, only he saw it on the specials menu and I saw it on the regular. Mine was like $7.99 and his was $6. His was a half that came with salad and fries and mine was a whole that came with fries (I subbed veggies).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Elizabeth R.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,43,1,1.0,1/1/2015,If I could give them zero stars I would. WORST SERVICE EVER. The employees and manager were extremely rude when I ordered food to go. I stood at the to go counter for probably 15 mins before any employee would even ask me if I was helped. Ended up telling them to keep their food and walked out empty handed after waiting forever and being talked down to by the employees. Will never give them my business again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Jesse P.,"San Antonio, TX",188,213,16,5.0,8/31/2013,Ok at least the boys and the wife are happy. For me it is just another Chili's. When I am on the road I like to eat at places that I can not eat at locally,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Angela P.,"San Diego, CA",8,105,31,3.0,2/10/2014,"Chili's is Chili's just about everywhere and this one was no different.  We went for lunch and it got crowded quick.  We ordered salads and the chicken flatbread.  No complaints from anyone.  The service was fast and the food arrived in a good amount of time.  We hung out for a little after we finished eating and we did not feel hurried by the staff, even though the restaurant was busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Monica O.,"Tempe, AZ",885,948,3098,2.0,10/24/2011,"Friends and I were headed out of town for the weekend, and decided to stop at Chilis for dinner and stretch before we continued working our way up north.  Now we were a party of 5, and had simple orders, yet everything kept getting messed up. Our waitress was having a ruff night, a friend ordered Dr Pepper, when it got refilled it didn't taste right, my friend asked her is this Dr Pepper, the waitress looked at her and said no its Diet like it was supposed to be that, and my friend said well I was drinking Dr Pepper, there was other mishaps that happened as well to the point to wear I just didn't want to eat and lost my appetite, and because of this I am giving Chilis 2 stars, but let me praise the night manger Angela, she was fast with making corrections and ensuring that our table was happy with what we did have, she fixed our bill and even gave us a free desert. If I could I would give Angela 5 stars! She is what great customer service is all about! Thank you Angela! But sadly I don't think I will be visiting a Chilis anytime soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Jessica P.,"Chandler, AZ",175,290,18,4.0,10/3/2010,"Yes. Its a chain. But to me, you can't go wrong with Chili's, especially after a long drive from the valley, you just need a beer to calm down about how many lizards you ran over on the way up here.  Its a standard Chili's yet the decor is a LOT less cluttered. Almost weird for a Chili's. I'm not even going to comment on the food. Its the same at every location.  Service in the bar is always great tho.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Kari L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,11,,1.0,7/11/2014,"Got there around lunchtime.  We were sat, ordered.  Shortly after two large groups came in.  We waited 30+ minutes for our food.  The large groups, that ordered after us, got their food first and even finished before we were served.  Terrible!  I had to call the manager over, who looked about 16.  He was like a nervous school kid, wasn't helpful until I asked for his bosses name.  Sad customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2
Karen F.,"Payson, AZ",3,41,,2.0,9/26/2013,"Love the Grand Patron margarita and the free Happy Hour Chips and Salsa...however...when we sat down at the bar it was dirty and sticky. I asked the person behind the bar for a wet bar rag. She wiped down the bar w/ a nasty dark dirty rag..looked like she took it out of a dirty bucket of water. I mentioned the nasty appearance of the cloth to her but she didnt seem to care she just proceeded to ""clean"" the bar. I have never seen anyone wipe down a bar w/ anything but a clean WHITE bar cloth. I took out my Clorox wipes and cleaned our area after she used the nasty rag on it. The bartender appeared from the kitchen area..filled our drink order and disappeared back into the kitchen.  Absolutely no atmosphere in the bar..no effort was made to engage us in conversation!!! Bartender spent more time in the kitchen than he did behind the bar.  We are locals who frequent Chili's sporadically but there was no effort made to provide the comfortable, small town feel that one would expect in Payson. Because I love the margarita's they serve we will be back but I would suggest management review their procedures for hygiene as well as atmosphere..otherwise we will just spend our cash at Buffalo Bar or Fargo's...would have only given this two stars but I do love the margaritas and chips/ salsa!!!!! UPDATE...1/17/13...Noticed the new outside paint job and I really wanted a Grand Patron margarita so I talked my hubby into going back to Chili's..what a nice surprise. The updated look inside is beautiful..modern..clean..open... The bar has been refinished a beautiful darker color and there are new TV's in the bar area. Another plus is the bartender, Randy. He was attentive and professional..will definitely return when he is working.  Glad we stopped back in..hope they keep up the appearance and keep Randy employed. UPDATE...9/26/13...well, it seems Chili's bar staff is back to it's old ways. Went in yesterday for a couple of drinks. The woman behind the bar seemed unusually stressed though it was mid-afternoon and not particularly crowded. We barely sat down and she curtly asked if we wanted something to drink. I asked for a minute to think about it. We placed our drink order which she filled. She asked if we were eating and we told her no. That was the end of any conversation with this unfriendly bartender. Another young woman came into the bar area to work and they spent their time talking to each other. Neither one attempted to make any small talk with my husband or I or the other two men at the bar.  However, two women came into the bar (possible relatives or friends) and the women behind the bar spent their time talking to these two women. I know good help is hard to find but to have bartenders who only speak to friends/relatives while working does not make for a friendly atmosphere for customers nor does it make me want to return. The tip we left ($1.00) reflected my opinion of the service we received!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2?start=20
Ed D.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",1244,394,455,4.0,9/16/2012,"The wife and I have always been Chili's fans, and though we have only been to this location a couple times, the food and service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2?start=20
Hank M.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,158,,5.0,12/30/2011,"Great stop on the way to Pinetop. Service and food have always been excellent. Wanted to call out our most recent visit as it speaks volumes.  We pulled into the parking lot at about 2 minutes to 9pm - thinking that on a weeknight they would at least be open to 10pm like we had experienced in the past when we passed through on Friday or Saturday. The sign on the entrance read closing at 9pm. We went in anyway expecting to be turned away. Instead, we were welcomed very graciously and warmly. They did not point out what time it was or suggest we come back another time. Instead we were treated like kings. No pressure to hurry up or move along. They insisted that we enjoy our eating experience and take our time. WOW ... talk about customer service!! In an age where you do not expect any form of customer service, they are a shining example of what it is meant to be. We will be back regularly and will do our part to direct all of our family, friends and acquaintances to Chilis in Payson. Many thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2?start=20
Campus F.,"Tempe, AZ",0,14,5,2.0,6/26/2010,I know this is a chain restaurant but I honestly had one of the worst steaks I've ever had..... I guess it was just a poor quality and cut of meat as it was mostly grizzle.  I probably should have sent it back but I' always afraid how kitchens will take criticism.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-payson-2?start=20
