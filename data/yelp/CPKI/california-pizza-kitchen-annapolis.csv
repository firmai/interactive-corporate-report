Jamie R.,"Baltimore, MD",63,58,172,4.0,12/29/2017,"Love California pizza kitchen. They have an array of options for pizza lovers and others alike. I tend to order a salad and soup when I am there and personally love their fresh tea options. Be sure to check those out!  The Cobb salad comes in a small or large portion and is very good. Sometimes it lacks sufficient dressing. Pizza options are great as well. Overall, very pleased with the menu options, cleanliness, and consistency of this chain.  The wait staff is not always the most knowledgeable however.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Art T.,"Crofton, MD",189,383,136,4.0,12/27/2017,"I have to preface this by saying we visited on Christmas Eve and with about an hour left until closing.  Still, it was a pretty great experience all things considered. We didn't have to wait at all for a table (beyond the fact that the place was pretty quiet).  The hostess was still attentive and cordial.  The server showed up pretty soon afterwards as well, and she was very attentive to us during our stay.  Refills were rapid and there was no waiting for an empty glass for the suggestion. The appetizer was... okay.  We ordered the Szechuan chicken dumplings, and I really didn't feel like they matched any of those words, save the chicken.  There was no real 'Szechuan' flavor profile, and it was instead a sweet and sticky sauce that batched the plate.  The onions were limp and stringy, and the noodles were overcooked. The pizza, on the other hand, was great.  We had one with whole wheat crust (the garlic chicken) and one with regular (wild mushroom).  Both were fantastic, with fresh and flavorful toppings.  They came out piping hot as well.   Overall, very much worth the visit.  Maybe we'll just skip the appetizer next time.  We could only get through half of each pizza anyway.  One would have been enough for the two of us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Emma W.,"Philadelphia, PA",211,112,,2.0,11/26/2017,"Went here for a lunch with friends and it was terrible. We weren't greeted for at least 10 minutes. We would have ordered drinks, but the server didn't even give us a drink menu or ask if we wanted anything other than water.  I was interested in the full piadina half salad combo available any day and our server had no idea what I was talking about, I had to point it out on the menu.  Our food came promptly and was frankly just not good. The piadina was dry and flavorless, there was no reason to keep the leftovers. As a pizza sandwich, it did not make me want to try their pizza. Everyone enjoyed their salads.  We waited for a while after done eating for the server to come with the check, all of us wondering where she went in the meantime. For the prices and mediocre food, I'd rather eat at the food court next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",29,191,220,5.0,9/1/2017,"Very fresh and delicious pizza! I ordered the Five Cheese and Fresh Tomato. It has mozzarella, Monterey Jack, smoked Gouda, and Romano cheese with tomato and fresh basil. As I write this, I realized this is only four types of cheese. Not sure what the fifth cheese is or if there even is one but it was delicious. I think it could of used some more basil but it was very good! The service was also great! It was very busy for lunch but our waiter was attentive and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Tanaga R.,"Bowie, MD",2,27,8,5.0,1/1/2018,My son had his 5th birthday party at this location! The general managers were an ease to work with and very responsive in the planning process! They ordered a Chef jacket for my son and it really gave the birthday boy a special touch! The food was delicious. We ordered appetizers and pizzas for the adults while the kiddos made their own cheese pizzas tableside! The bbq chicken and carne Assad Pizzas were a hit with the adults. The meat on the carne Assad pizza was so tender! Definitely a nice spot w great service for parties or dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Carmen M.,"Bowie, MD",0,15,25,5.0,12/5/2017,"Ah this place is fantastic. Their avocado club egg rolls are absolutely amazing and the pizzas have a unique mix of ingredients but are delicious. Their signature is the BBQ pizza which is so good, but I usually get the California Cobb pizza. My mom always gets the chicken Waldorf salad and wipes the bowl clean. I 10/10 recommend!

Steve E.,"Laurel, MD",56,85,87,4.0,5/21/2017,"Arrived and was seated quickly despite it being moderately busy. Place is nice and clean. Service was good. My only complain is that water is not brought out you must ask for it. And the napkins are paper not cloth. They do provide complimentary bread (not warm) with a olive oil and spice mix (not the best) I have been to CPK before but at an Airport location. I have tried the famous ""BBQ Chicken Pizza"" which is you must order if you never been here. Since this was my first time at this location I chose to be adventurous and try something different. Drink:  CUCUMBER REVIVER (delicious and refreshing) will order again Appetizer: CHARRED SHISHITO PEPPERS ( mild spicy and goes good with the tosatada pizza)..its ok will try something different next time Main course:  TOSTADA Pizza, (healthy and good but not impressed by the presentation) stick to the BBQ chicken pizza next time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Daniel M.,"Arundel Mills, MD",147,1,,1.0,12/4/2017,"I hate this place.  The wait staff has no sense of urgency, and it always takes 5-10 minutes before we're even greeted.  We were greeted by a nice young lady who sat us at our table.  And as anticipated we waited for 5 minutes, not even a ""hey i will be right with you.""  So we decided to move to the bar.  We were greeted by the bartender who took our drink and food order.  We ordered salad, soups, and pizza.  Since we're at the bar you can view the kitchen staff work and the pizzas being made.  I watched our bartender prepare our soups, he used his fingers to clean the spoons. Absolutely disgusting.  I don't think I've ever written a review, but this place just disappoints time and time again.  Terrible service and not sanitary.  We will not return or spend any money here in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Jason S.,"Leesburg, VA",1,5,4,4.0,6/17/2017,The Annapolis location was very good! Great food and  service. Minimal wait on a Saturday evening around 6 the day before Father's Day I got the garlic fettuccine with chicken and shrimp. Cream sauce was just right! Not to heavy and very delicious!!

Julia P.,"Baltimore, MD",147,23,,3.0,11/26/2017,Is CPK going downhill? CPK in Annapolis has always been a reliable lunch spot. We were fairly disappointed with our experience today. The service was inattentive. We were not greeted by our server for about 10 minutes and then she did not check on us after food was delivered and we had a hard time getting her attention to get the check. The salad was fine but not exciting and didn't seem as fresh as usual. Disappointed because I expect more from this restaurant!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Amana C.,"DE, DE",135,383,740,4.0,8/18/2016,"Trendier and smaller than most CPKs Ive been too. Rustic decor, nice ambiance. Friendly service. Plenty of options.  I think CPK makes great pizza, however the entrees are good not great. The cedar plank salmon and fish tacos were both good but could have been more flavorful. Next time I'll stick to pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Lil Birdie N.,"Severn, MD",10,170,563,4.0,7/31/2017,Food here is pretty decent. Too bad they don't have many locations in the area. Eating here way healthier than fast food.  Got all sorts of pizza if your in the mood for that.  If not. There are lots more healthy stuff to order. Service a little slow. But we like the food.

Bob C.,"Annapolis, MD",0,7,,1.0,9/2/2017,"No waiting as were having  late lunch at 3:30. After being seated for we hadn't had our orders taken. Most of the staff was talking to each other, our server was in a one sided conversation less than 10 feet from where we were seated.  We left 15 minutes after we were seated.  The hostess said ""have a great day"" as we walked out.   She didn't know our orders hadn't been taken. When we asked for the manager it ""He's out to lunch"". The good part is we don't have to wait again for crappy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
B. S.,"Annapolis, MD",8,44,5,4.0,5/9/2017,"A friend and I met here today for lunch. They were pretty busy which is a good sign. The restaurant appeared to be clean and the server was quick to show up. Our appetizer came out in about 15 to 20 minutes which felt kind of long but I was really hungry. The appetizer was really good. We both ordered the salad and pizza combination for lunch which a nice price for the amount of food you get. The food was good but not amazing.  Overall, I'd go back: good service, good prices, clean restrooms and they have a rewards program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Rob B.,"Kaneohe, HI",226,1086,884,3.0,2/8/2016,"Pretty nice looking after a recent remodel. Service has not been remodeled, not poor but doesn't match the decor. I just stopped in for the 1/2 size Waldorf Salad witch is just great. The amount of chicken sliced so very thin is disappointing but there is no lack of glazed nuts. I guess that the chicken is portioned for cost cutting and the nuts abundant for lack of portioning.    I got the dressing on the side which I suggest, the salad is so good it does not need dressing. More attentive serve would earn another star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
John D.,"Annapolis, MD",213,7,1,2.0,8/12/2017,"I used to come here when I worked in the mall back in high school. That was 1995-1996. Service was horrible back then. I now have two kids - now 7 and 8, and sadly for me, I have to keep coming back and realizing that the service is still just as bad. It's almost as if it is run by a bunch of lazy teenagers who have no understanding of what it's like to run a real customer service operation. Decent food, especially for a mall...but just absolutely shocked their service is so amazingly horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Mia L.,"Glen Burnie, MD",51,172,196,3.0,9/1/2016,"CPK is pretty good. I've only gotten pizza from here even though their pasta dishes and salads do sound enticing. The pizza, however, is pretty solid.  Last night, my friend and I decided to split a pizza here after leaving a Yelp event. We were hungry but not so hungry that we needed an entire pizza to ourselves. We went with a pepperoni pizza which came out great as usual. The service was pretty slow which is something we didn't quite understand considering there weren't many people there and it was getting late, around 9 pm on a weekday.  Overall, CPK is pretty cool. I don't feel like it's anything to rave about but it's a nice chain restaurant and is one of many dining options at the Annapolis mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
Stacey E.,"Baltimore, MD",82,89,35,4.0,1/31/2017,I have not ate here since high school. It was really good and packed for a Thursday afternoon!

Miriam M.,"Annapolis, MD",0,16,,2.0,10/22/2017,"Had dinner here last night and was disappointed with the food brought to our table. The roasted vegetable salad was saturated with too much olive oil to be a healthy choice. The spaghetti and sauce were cold . When I finally found  the waitress who was quite busy and had not been checking in with us , she offered to heat up my cold spaghetti. The quality of the food seems to be declining at CPK and my recommendation is to find better alternative at the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis
C.

Received a call from the manager - oh...we're so sorry, so come on in and have dinner.  We arrive- no one knows us- no one cares...and where's the manager?  He's not there.  I am flight attendant for over 30 years and I give all customers - excellent - service and they tell me that often.  I know what I give and I know when people just don't care.  CPK just doesn't care.  So be it.   I'll spend my $$ in a place where people don't act like they doing me a big favor taking my $$.  Adios CPK- you're not the only game in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=60
Gemma H.,"Annapolis, MD",7,10,1,3.0,6/6/2014,"I generally come here with the same friend once every other week and we get great service pretty consistently. However, in the past couple visits our service has been horrible. Took fifteen minutes to be greeted by our server, then she did not want to accept our free spinach dip coupon. Once our food finally arrived, it was definitely up to CPK standards. The two of us both finished our drinks and were never offered refills.

Ma-e M.,"Baltimore County, MD",0,1416,571,3.0,9/20/2012,"Just entering the restaurant, I could feel the classy, delightful ambiance of people happy eating in the afternoon inside and outside patio. The Kitchen is located inside Westfield Mall and next to Nordstrom and The Cheesecake Factory, this place I feel has a vibrant energy. The interior is light and cozy to the eyes. And the food is fantastic too. Don't ever think just because it's name has the word pizza that it only offers pizza. CPK is much more than any kind of pizzeria. I rarely come to CPK for food but I invite you to check out the menu and discover that CPK has variety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=60
Dana D.,"Annapolis, MD",0,6,5,4.0,6/28/2013,pretty good food and reasonably priced; it had been years since I went to CPK and was happy with our experience.

Christopher D.,"Waldorf, MD",1,21,2,1.0,8/11/2015,"Disappointed, very slow.  My wife and I went to this CPK for a lunch before a medical appointment, and has been looking forward to it.  I had budgeted an hour's time to eat lunch, which should have been long enough, but no!  We ordered our meals and appetizer and our drinks when we were asked for our drink order, indicating that we were in a hurry.  Took quite a while just to get our water, then the waitress disappeared.  Half hour later, our appetizer finally came out, but the waitress gave it to a neighboring table - they said it wasn't theirs and I told her it was ours, and waitress promptly took it back to the kitchen without a word (maybe because it was contaminated by being placed on somebody else's table?).  At that point we were confident that we weren't going to receive our lunch menu meals anytime soon, so had to leave.  If the waitress wasn't AWOL we could have told her.  Worst experience at a CPK so far, but we will continue to eat at other CPK locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=60

He tried to redeem himself later which I appreciate but it was 13 mins to late.

Stopped at CPK for a bite to eat but was disappointed. Pear walnut gorgonzola salad is usually my favorite but the candied walnuts weren't fresh. The greek pizza was good as normal. But the sangria wasn't too hot- the fancy dressings on the drink looked cute but the drink itself was thick like it had mango puree in it or something...not at all like you'd expect out of a light wine sangria cocktail.

Ravon R.,"Washington, DC",5,32,42,4.0,1/11/2015,"So. I love CPK. We go way back to my Richmond days. However, this was my first time at this location. When we arrived, there was a 15 min wait so they took one of our numbers to text us when the table would be ready. When we returned, it's was odd because the hostess had completely forgotten she had seen us before (3 black women, and one with a blonde fro and big glasses) but it was fine we had a few laughs about it. As usual the drinks were strong and the appetizers were delightful (hummus and wheat pita and white corn guacamole). My friend's mother did order the fried mac and cheese and those were rather flavorless but otherwise all else was good. I ordered the mushroom pizza with truffle oil and that was really good for my first time ordering that. Our waitress was subpar but doable, she had a hard time getting back to the table in time. This particular location and on this Saturday night was filled with toddlers so that made for interesting scenes but otherwise it was an enjoyable night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=60
Erica C.,"Odenton, MD",266,173,121,3.0,12/20/2012,Spinach dip was okay. I got the salmon with pasta and asparagus. The salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked. The pasta had capers and it was good after I squeezed lemon on it and salted it. The grilled asparagus was pretty tasty. My nephew had fruit and salad from the children's menu. It was just lettuce and gold fish. He ate the goldfish. I was thinking...hmmm is this the best they can do on this salad?! All of the fun salads they have on the menu..they expect kids to eat lettuce and gold fish. How sad. That salad was sad sad sad. What was not sad how ever was the red velvet cake.

In all fairness I tried one of their suggested new dishes, Penne and sun-dried tomatoes....doesn't hold a candle to the fusilli dish they took off the menu.  It was bland and unspectacular.  But I guess if that is what management wants us to eat, that's what we get, or we won't be ""moving forward"" .

Shawn W.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",122,470,2428,3.0,2/28/2015,One day I will try the pizza to see what the CPK is all about. Today was not that day. I ordered more than a few items to sample so don't judge me. I began with the chips/guacamole and avocado eggrolls. The guacamole was good and had a little kick to it. At $4 don't expect a very filling snack which leads into the avocado eggrolls. The eggrolls also contained chicken and some bacon and the bacon was a dominant flavor that was tasted. Both apps were good and satisfying. I ordered the Italian sandwhich that came with split pea soup. The soup was very surprising as I never tried split pea soup before and now I am wondering what have I been missing all these years. CPK you make me look back at some life decisions I have made. The Italian came on a ciabatta bun that was very soft and this was a pleasant surprise as many places seem to have very hard ciabatta bread for their sandwiches.  Overall I will be making a trip back to try some of their other items as the food is more than good at a very fair price.

Yohanna was my waitress & she was pleasant and very accommodating. I opted for the mango lemonade which was refreshing. For an appetizer I enjoyed the avocado chicken egg rolls w/the two sauces. My entree was the tried and true jambalaya. Today it was off. It tasted different and the pasta was undercooked. This was not a problem as Yohanna graciously swapped it out for a cobb salad.

Love the Sicilian, Thai, and California-style pizzas. We always get the whole wheat crust, so yummy with that hint of sweetness. The Thai Crunch and Waldorf Chicken are my go-to salads. I always ask for very light or no dressing, because you won't even miss it with all the sweet, salty, crunchy toppings. Yes, CPK is a chain, but it's better than most of your options out there!

Elle H.,"Crofton, MD",101,117,1203,4.0,11/28/2015,"My mom, neighbor, and I ate here last week. It was on a weekday, a little after 4pm. We asked for a table and we were taken to a booth. I have to mention that the past 4-5 times I've come here, every time I ask for a table I've been taken to a booth. It's not a huge deal, but there IS a difference between the two. When you're out with friends and each friend has a couple of shopping bags the booth gets a bit cramped for my liking. You're able to spread out more at the tables. When we ask for a table again, we're almost always met with a slight eye roll or sigh, even though there is never anyone in the table sections to the left. I don't get it.  Again - it's not a big deal, but I guess the next time we go we'll have to be super specific and say we don't want a booth.  Anyway - we were seated at a table promptly. Our sever comes over, introduces herself, and takes our drink order. She was very polite and friendly, but always seemed to be in a rush. The restaurant wasn't crowded - maybe 3 booths and 2 tables taken up, so we didn't understand what the hurry was. We start to order our appetizer but she walks away without hearing us. She comes back with our drinks and we order the Avocado Club Egg Rolls appetizer (hand-wrapped crispy wontons stuffed with chicken, avocado, tomato, cheese, and bacon, which comes with a ranchito dipping sauced and an herb ranch dipping sauce).  In the middle of ordering the appetizer, the chef comes out to talk to the woman at the table next to us and our server at the same time, thus interrupting our order mid-talk. There was no ""excuse me"" or any acknowledgment from him - he just started talking over us. We waited until their conversation ended and ordered the appetizer again. My neighbor and mom order the half size Chinese Chicken salad (napa, red cabbed, lettuce, chicken, wontons tossed with scallions, cilantro, sesame seeds and hoisin ginger vinaigrette). I order a half Classic Caesar salad (with shaved parmesan cheese and garlic butter croutons) and the Pesto Cream Penne with chicken (basil peso cream sauce, sun dried tomatoes, parmesan cheese).  A couple of minutes after we ordered, our server gives us warm bread and olive oil. The bread was soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and the olive oil dip was fresh and yummy. My caesar salad comes about 5 minutes later. I thought it was strange that my salad came out before the appetizer, but I dug in anyway. The salad was fresh and tasted great, but I wish it had more dressing. After another 10-15 wait, two salads and my pasta hit the table. We asked our server about the appetizer and she looked like a deer in headlights. She asked if we ordered one. We told her yes, we did order it. She apologized and asked if we still wanted it. We told her yes, and she said she would put the order in right away. The appetizer came out shortly after. It wasn't that long of a wait. The egg rolls were delicious. It's one of our favorite items on the menu. The dipping sauces compliment the egg rolls well. My mom and my neighbor enjoyed their salads. I would suggest ordering a half size. The portions are huge! My pesto cream penne was delicious. There was plenty of chicken and sun dried tomatoes. There was a lot of sauce but the pasta wasn't drowning in it, which I like. Our server was very nice, but was a bit scatterbrained. If the restaurant isn't crowded, there's no reason to be in such a rush. She did check in with us to see how our meals were and gave us refills on water twice. We waited for her for several minutes to pick up the signed check and her tip but she was standing in the back chatting with two co-workers and didn't look over. We left with it on the table. Overall, we had an okay experience. We had no complaints about the food. The food is always consistent at this restaurant.

When I asked to be seated outside, the silverware was dirty, so I had to ask for a cup of hot water to try to sanitize everything. I guess you can't expect much on that area from chain restaurants or even non-chains nowadays. On the flip side, I love and highly recommend their flat crust margherita pizza with wheat whole grain crust and pepperoni, so much so that I can ignore the unsightliness of the place. Waitress I had was OK, she was busy with other tables and didn't really pay attention to us, so if it wasn't for the pizza tasting so darn good, I would probably give this place a two star review. I've gone to the one in Tyson's mall in VA and had the same issue of great food, bad presentation.

Misty D.,"Odenton, MD",60,114,1898,4.0,6/3/2009,"As far as chain restaurants go, this is my favorite for the kiddos.   The kids' menu contains some reasonably healthy items, and the food has always been fresh and good.  Kids' meals range from $5.50-$6.50 and include a drink.  Choices include the predictable pizza and pasta (select one from the menu, or request ""grown up"" toppings if your kid is so inclined).  Chickadee usually orders a pizza on whole wheat crust with kalamata olives.  Yeah, she's three, but don't tell her that!  She's had the mac and cheese before, and while it's very tasty to me, it may be a bit heavy/creamy for tinier tummies.  Add a side of edamame for .49 to have even more protein.  Other menu items include a tossed salad topped with Goldfish crackers and grilled (yes, grilled!) chicken.  Throw in a side of fruit--halved grapes and pineapple chunks--for .99, and you have a meal that you can feel good about feeding your offspring.  The kids' menu also features two desserts--an M&M's sundae or brownie for .99.   Your little one will be occupied by the multi-page activity book and crayons until his/her meal is ready.  Sign up for the CPK Kids' Club, and your child will receive a coupon for a free meal during his/her birthday month.   The waitstaff never seems annoyed when you're dining with kids, and there is a changing table in the women's room.  An insider's tidbit:  I usually park in the Nordstrom garage and use their women's lounge/baby changing area on the first floor for a quick feeding/pit stop before heading over to CPK.  Nordstrom also has a family restroom on the first floor. Parents: there's plenty of tasty and interesting food for you too.  Today I opted for the grilled vegetable focaccia.  For ten bucks, I got a decent-sized sandwich and a bowl of soup.  In the past, I've also ordered pizza and salad.  I've never had a bad meal here. My one complaint, and it's a small one, is that the restaurant can be fairly noisy during peak hours.  I usually arrive at opening time (11:30; though sometimes the doors are unlocked earlier) and this makes for a better experience for my crew.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=80

I have no idea what the dining experience would have been like had I dined in the restaurant!!  But I will definitely do that next time I go!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Fatima B.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",228,66,97,5.0,1/1/2016,"Amazinggg service, Laura is an amazing waitress. We got there and had a party of 10 on a friday night and only had to wait 5-10 minutes to get our table. When before we had gone to cheescake factory and having us wait 2 and a half hours! But Laura went ABOVE and beyond woth her service and the manager was super nice! I will continue to come back just for Laura.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Kaitlyn R.,"Annapolis, MD",175,6,,1.0,6/20/2015,"My mom came here yesterday and doesn't have a yelp account so I'm writing this for her: the service was awful, and when I manager came over for her to say something a roach crawled down the wall their table was against. And when my mom freaked out about it she caught the manager rolling his eyes at her and his only response to the roach was ""would you like me to move your table?""

Sierra S.,"Annapolis, MD",35,133,35,3.0,10/26/2014,"3.5 stars really because curbside pick-up is supposed to be convenient and more often than not, it's been a hassle.  The food is pretty good. I like the jambalaya pasta even though I don't eat sausage or ham so I spend most of the time picking it out. A little nutty... Try not to judge.  The pizza is pretty good. I particularly like the whole grain crust and even though I order a plain cheese pizza, it's still pretty good. I've tried the white pizza but I'm not a fan.  As for desserts, I like the butter cake. The sugar crystals on it are a bit unnerving but it's still a pretty good cake. Not too sweet and no icing but a great alternative to cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Kimberly A.,"Houston, TX",83,86,33,4.0,8/22/2014,"So many great menu items at CPK as usual! The small plates menu...the seasonal summer menu...so hard to choose. Ended up deciding on the JAMBALAYA FETTUCCINE and  MARGHERITA PIZZA WITH SAUSAGE. My coworker raves about their Margherita which was quite delectable with a perfectly crispy thin crust and the classic combo of cheesy, tomatoey, basil-y melted goodness. With the heartiness of the sausage it almost kept me from ordering off the small plates menu...almost. I did try the FRIED MACARONI BITES, which is nothing special. Save yourself the trouble, I will say it was nicely fried with the crunchy panko crust though.  My hubbie's fettuccine was perfectly al dente. Be prepared! It it a huge plate. And since it is Jambalaya-inspired, it is on the salty Cajun side of the flavor spectrum. Order an extra drink alongside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Amir P.,"Baltimore, MD",3,51,23,5.0,5/29/2015,Good food.  Tasty Pizza and very tasty spring rolls. Clean and friendly people too. Would definitely come back to try some of their other menu items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Kevin B.,"California, MD",2,15,2,2.0,8/10/2015,"As long long time patron of California Pizza Kitchen of over 20 years at various locations around the country I've come to have certain expectations of the quality of food and service.  I typically experience average service and slightly above average food quality.  However my last 2 experiences, both of which were at this location (coincidentally I assume), were disappointing.   I typically avoid ordering appetizers and such at most restaurants but decided the Crispy Mac n' Cheese seemed interesting.  It was a major disappointment.  I found the 4 tiny little deep fried medallions (I dont recall the menu saying deep fried though it does so online) underwhelming and disgustingly greasy on the outside.  The macaronis were slightly overcooked and the cheddar cheese of low quality.  The cheese sauce was about as appetizing as cheese whiz. For the meal itself we split a Caesar salad and Spinach and Artichoke Thin Crust pizza.  I tried the pizza first and was disappointed from the first bite.  The crust was paper thin, much thinner than any thin crust pizza I've ever had any where.  The overall flavor of the pizza was, well pretty much in a word, gross.  Unfortunately my disappointment didn't end there. The Caesar salad left much to be desired thanks to the dressing. The dressing was very watery and dominated by vinegar (I assume) or lemon juice if actually made from scratch.  The positive about the salad is that the lettuce was fresh and crispy.    In defense of this location I place the blame neither on the location staff nor the management. As always our waitress was friendly, prompt and appropriately attentive.  The food appeared at our table in quick order.  If not for that this visit would have rated 1 star.  I place the majority of the fault with the recipes and prepared items emanating from the corporate CPK chefs.  I think its too bad, though understandable, that Yelp provides for reviews of only individual locations and not the chains themselves visible regardless of their members locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Anne H.,"Crofton, MD",0,13,,5.0,9/3/2015,"Granted we went on a Tuesday night around 6:30, but we were seated right away and very nice service!  Each got a half salad - the Mediterranean Chicken and the BBQ Chicken.  Both were excellent, and we were well taken care of by our friendly server.  Like the remodel - less kid-friendly, which is great for those of us who are done with those early years!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Alyssa O.,"Pentagon City, Arlington, VA",14,9,2,2.0,5/6/2015,"The spicy chicken tinga quesadilla is standard. That's how I feel about CPK. They don't go beyond their expectations, since they are so corporate. However, my friend who ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pizza asked what made the pizza spicy. Our server answered, but didn't ask if he prefer his pizza spicy or not. His pizza came with extra peppers, and he was extremely disappointed that he had to pick them off himself. The overall experience was not up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Bobby F.,"Annapolis, MD",170,128,15,3.0,2/17/2015,"I love the food here. The BBQ Chicken Pizza, Jambalaya pasta, Tri Colore Pizza Salad, Key Lime Pie are great to name a few. But riddle me this....Why over the last 10 years has CPK turned it's Restaurant into a Twin Sister of CheeseCake Factory? What happened to the tile floors and the mirrors all over the store? If I want the ambiance of CheeseCake I'll walk 20 feet next store. CPK used to be a fun place to hang out with friends and family casually. Now, I feel as though I am going to a fine dining experience or a Black Tie Event which is not what the original CPK vibe was. I know this considered an ""upscale"" restaurant, but hopefully CPK does not make it impossible for a middle class family to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Wayne G.,"Baltimore, MD",32,410,25,3.0,12/30/2013,"We were a group of about 10 and had a variety of entrees and everyone enjoyed them.  The caramelized peach salad with bacon was great.  The restaurant was kept up and clean.  Large groups, like most restaurants, put a gratuity on the bill.  Like many such places the wait staff sort of disappears figuring they're getting 18% anyway.  We had to ask repeatedly for drink refills or I'd have given them 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Sonya T.,"Washington, DC",10,11,3,1.0,4/19/2015,CPK was one of my favorite places.... Let's just say Annapolis Maryland location ruined that yesterday. I ordered a salad with salmon to go to enjoy for dinner last night...It was horrible I live over an hour away so I was stuck with the worst salad in history... I will mostly likely never eat at this location again...I definitely will never order take out from any CPK...I will now only dine in at Pentagon City or Montgomery Mall... Eat...take out at your own RISK!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
Paul S.,"Millersville, MD",0,17,5,3.0,8/10/2014,The food is good but the place is dirty. There is trash everywhere and it hasn't been dusted in a while. I could see the food prep area where I was seated and I saw one server pick his nose and then handle the plates. Another server spilled a salad on a pizza then he picked it all off and put the salad back in the bowl. Then he fluffed it all up and re-arranged the pizza a bit then took it out to the table. I know this stuff goes on in all restaurants but they didn't even care that customers could see what they were doing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-annapolis?start=40
