10,Steve J.,"Nashville, TN",248,34,5.0,4.0,2012-07-07,"My family met for a Friday night dinner that is a halfway point between our homes.  This Chili's Grill has always been a great place for us, even though national chain restaurants are not my favorite.  We usually meet during the busy dinner hour and they always seat our group quickly and provide friendly, helpful service.  Our waiter was awesome and deserved 5 stars for his service.  He only wanted to help and was very attentive without hovering.  That is really hard to do when the restaurant is rocking. We all had something completely different to eat, but our food was delivered hot, fresh and quickly.  They were very accommodating to our special requests and everything was served correctly.  I had a new item, the Santa Fe salad which was very good.   It is a southwestern inspired salad with chicken and a little bit of spice.  The salad paired well with their citrus balsamic vinaigrette, even though it is usually served with another dressing.  The are located close to the interstate, halfway between Knoxville and Nashville.  If you need a quick, convenient lunch or dinner, then I would recommend Chili's Grill and Bar in Cookeville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
11,Peggy H.,"Cookeville, TN",34,65,36.0,4.0,2013-05-12,"Typical Chilis Grill & Bar.  Service is fine, food is typical for a Chili's.  There's usually not much of a wait.  They seem to do a good job of training and we also enjoy a quick stop for take out chips & salsa from time to time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
12,Carla A.,"Welches, OR",0,5,2.0,3.0,2014-05-20,"Service was good, I haven't been here in a couple years, my husband loved it back then. I had the same thing we had back then an app. That was fried southwest egg rolls. There was not one piece of chicken in my egg rolls and a couple of black beans it was mostly filled with spinach, and the price was outrageous. The chips and salsa and guacamole were wonderful. I will try one more time. Then I will not visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
9,S J.,"Knoxville, TN",0,2,,1.0,2015-01-17,"VERY SLOW service...not the waitress ' fault...they appeared to be very understaffed. We arrived at 4:30 in the afternoon  and it took over an hour to get our entrees...felt bad for the waitress, but we will NEVER go back to another Chili's..In addition, the menu was very confusing and my husband was disappointed when he got his food because the 2/20 menu did not include black beans and rice that was included on the regular entree...not a good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,

6,Laura K.,"Cookeville, TN",0,5,,1.0,2016-06-03,"Good, bad &ugly... Bad: Margarita ordered no salt...came with salt           Chili cheese fries came with no ranch dressing           Side salad came with meal Used irons killed from fried to TRY to keep it warm. Still was lukewarm when I finally got to it. Took it home. Good: Side salad was REALLY good!             Chili cheese fries good, too. Ugky: too bad that pretty decent food is ruined by REALLY poor service! Who doesn't get that a salad should be served & consumed before the hot food comes to the table???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
5,Tamara Y.,"Winder, GA",0,1,,1.0,2016-06-19,"In general, I like Chili's. However, this location is terrible. We waited 40 minutes for our food...at lunch. We had to ask the waitress to check on our food to finally get it. And the order was not correct when it finally came. The check was delivered without a pen. We had to sign the credit card slip in crayon. The food was mediocre at best. We went for lunch and the restaurant was only all full. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
7,Will D.,"Wichita, KS",1,11,,5.0,2016-08-09,I was very impressed with this location.  At the end of the day it's a chain and is what it is.  Bar staff was very friendly and attentive.  I will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
3,Becky M.,"Cookeville, TN",193,311,1383.0,1.0,2017-02-01,"The Harley Davidson group came, called ahead, and the staff was not prepared. In fact the staff and management were so poor. I will not come here again with a large group. Meals were forgotten. I had to get up and go seek out things. All around it was a very bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
1,Jeff L.,"Asheville, NC",124,5,7.0,2.0,2017-07-23,"Wish I had seen the two star rating before we went because they really lived up to the rating. Slow service, waited forever on food, salad under heat lamp, etc. etc. but the one I can't get past is filth. The whole restaurant is filthy from the front door to the back.  Step one, fire the manager and start with someone who cares. Nothing will happen until the person that accepts this level of service and cleanliness is removed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
2,James T.,"Rock Island, TN",0,4,2.0,1.0,2017-09-04,Walk in and almost empty. Might have been 10 tables. They proceed to set my wife and myself in a corner with two dinning areas empty. This might be the last time i return here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cookeville,,,,,
