38,Ryan D.,"Westport, MA",13,46,8.0,1.0,2012-12-26,terrible service..... So for terrible service i tipped 10% i find out a few days later  when the waitress ran my card she changed a 3 to an 8 giving herself an extra 5 bucks!  Guess she felt she did a better job then we did........ and my 3 looked like a 3 trust me,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116
41,David D.,"Dartmouth, MA",0,14,,1.0,2013-02-08,"I ate here for lunch in November when I first moved to Dartmouth. It was a very bad experience. We had a booth with a view of the kitchen. The staff were using their cellphones on the cooking line. Besides suggesting that they were not paying attention to their jobs (they weren't, the food was cold--having never been fully heated), cell phones are disgusting. They were touching their personal phones, wearing gloves, then touching the food. Probably a health violation. On the up side, we mentioned the problems to the new manager, and he handled it well, taking a substantial sum off of the bill. Not enough for me to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116
28,Shannon F.,"Westport, MA",163,450,501.0,4.0,2013-04-10,"I have never had an issue at this Fridays.  I probably come in here about once a month for drinks, and I think it's been 5 years since I sat in the Dining room.  But even coming in about once a month, there are two bartenders that ALWAYS remember my name, and sometimes, it will be months before I see them again.  That's what I call customer service.  Also. I think the rewards card is totally worth your time.  I don't have a heck of a lot of money, but when I am travelling or am just short on cash I can pretty much bank I will at least have points enough for a free appetizer.  And frankly, I am not a big person, a lot of times the free appetizer is enough to fill me up.  Cleanliness isn't perfect there, but honestly, it's such a big place, if there's some French fries on the floor, I'm not going to complain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth?start=20,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
26,Scott G.,"New Bedford, MA",3,14,,4.0,2013-05-08,"I'm shocked to see any bad reviews of this place... The staff is always genuinely friendly, the food is consistently delicious and always prepared to my liking. In the very rare event that something is not right, the staff and management are quick to make it right and always offer something to leave you feeling satisfied. I highly recommend the 10oz sirloin (although I skip the Mason butter) - Ordered medium, it is cooked to perfection! - Juicy, tender, delicious! The entire staff makes you feel genuinely welcome and appreciated. From the host/hostess to the waitstaff and management, the whole team works together very well. Out of the corporate meat and potatoes restaurants in the area, TGIF's feels most welcoming and comfortable. Not too loud, not to stuffy, just casual and comfortable. Highly recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
35,Scott M.,"North Dartmouth, MA",16,17,,1.0,2013-05-29,"For the price... Terrible. Considering the value of a good cheeseburger at a place like Five Guys is less than Friday's, you'd think the service would be better. But in this case, you'd be wrong. Just. Plain. Wrong. The food is greasy and flavorless. The waitress nicely asked if I wanted a drink but didn't bring me it until I was done with my lunch. She was uninterested in doing her job. She never even checked to see how our meals were.

33,Allie L.,"London, United Kingdom",1,14,,1.0,2014-10-26,"I am very fond of TGI Friday's as a brand. However my experience at this particular establishment of casual dining left me with a bitter taste in my mouth, which had little to do with the poor quality of the food.  Our waiter was aloof and when asked a simple question regarding a menu item seemed unhappy and disappointed that I didn't know what it was, odd, seeing as I don't work there, I suppose I should have intimately researched all menu items prior to attending.  Furthermore, I witnessed many distressing behaviors exhibited by the waitstaff. I could see the kitchen from my seat and witnessed my waiter eating with his hands on the job. When I went to the bathroom a member of the waitstaff walked in at the same time as me, proceeded to cough, vomit, cough some more, and walk out of the bathroom without washing their hands. Not a confidence inspiring, moment. Overall the food was a 2, the waitstaff a negative 2. This averages to a solid zero.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth?start=20,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

I had a rum punch that was good and a little over $8. The portion size of my salmon was pathetic. I had more broccoli on the plate then my entree size. The fries were (warm) not hot. My boyfriend got some chicken on a stick appetizer that was a baby size too. We went because we had a gift certificate, but we will never go back again. I'd rather eat a good meal at a Seafood restaurant if I'm going to pay that kind of money. His steak was cooked good and his son also got a small steak. They said it was pretty good.

34,Benjamin C.,"Tiverton, RI",0,4,,1.0,2015-02-18,"Excuse me, but I must rant a little. My wife, son and I were out doing some shopping in the area and decided to give this place a try. I wished I hadn't. The experience started off as most do, but it quickly went down hill. We were seated and it took 10 minutes for our server to even come and take our drink order (Two lemonades, and a strawberry lemonade for our son). When he returned with our drinks (15 minutes later!) It was wrong. We received one lemonade, one lemonade sprite thing, and a strawberry lemonade. We thought, ""No big deal, it happens, he's only human."" The issue was... He blamed the long wait and wrong drink on the bartender. Now, I'm not sure, since I have never been a server, but I thought the job of ensuring what is being brought to the table is right, was the job of the server. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Moving on... we ordered an appetizer so we could have something on the table for our son to munch on. Since he is just a little over 18 months old, he gets cranky when he is hungry and forced to set still. Obviously that is not the establishments fault, but what is, is the fact that it took almost 20 minutes for them to bring the appetizer to the table! It took another 20 minutes for our entree's to arrive. (If your keeping track we have been at this place for 65 minutes and we just got our entree""s) We ate our COLD food, and did not see our server again until he brought us our bill for $39.57, 10 minutes after we had finished eating. Now, you would think it is all over and we would simply not eat there again... Nope, I look at my bank statement the next afternoon and our server charged us not only for the original $39.57 but for an additional $144.06! I called the establishment and explained the scenario and the manger would not do anything to rectify the situation and simply told me to have a nice day. I placed a dispute with my bank to have the issue resolved. I would not recommend anyone eat at the place. I would give them zero stars if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth?start=20,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

30,Jessica D.,"Assonet, MA",0,1,,1.0,2015-08-11,"I want to start this post off but saying that I've worked in different restaurants my entire life since my first job when I was 13 years old. And with that being said, I've dealt with a lot of different people and personalities. Including children, who can be very difficult and picky. So when a family comes in and the child has their own food with them, wether it be from home or fast food like McDonald's I am completely understanding and would never think twice about it. However, tonight I went to TGI FRIDAYS in North Dartmouth with a 5 year old who wanted McDonald's for dinner. I didn't think anything of it and sat him down with his burger to eat. Not even 5 minutes later the general manager, John, comes over to our table throwing his hands up and telling me that ""this is a business, and we can't bring in outside food when they're trying to sell food"" .. I was completely caught off guard and explained to him that he's 5 and a picky eater so he wouldn't have eaten off the kids menu their anyways .. The manager continued to make a scene and scream at all of us telling us he can't eat there .. So needless to say we left and went elsewhere. I completely understand if we weren't allowed to bring outside food in, but I also don't see the problem when it comes to a child. And the way the ""general manager"" went about it was completely unprofessional and uncalled for .. Not only does the food at TGI FRIDAYS suck but apparently so does the staff, especially management. Not too long ago I would come to TGI Fridays with my family every week if not twice a week, but the food has gone downhill quick and so has the guest service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth?start=20,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

Atmosphere was good not too crowded. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Food was surprising good for what it was. Price was middle road a little pricier than other places but it was good. I took my extras home for later. I had the potato skins as an app. Then the bbq chicken flatbread which was excellent then a burger was ok. Had better and worse it was what it was.

I arrived last month with my daughter Delilah after a long day of Christmas shopping. Our waitress Alexa was extremely friendly and welcoming. The apple spinach salad and Cosmo I had were amazing. She also got my daughter to actually order something which is extraordinary . When it came out with sauce (not earlier specified)She handled  my daughters indecisive dinner request with kindness and grace. And soon brought out her plain noodles. Then for desert Alexa went out of her way to make Delilah a brownie sundae (not on the menu).

I came in with my 3 month old baby who was sleeping in her car seat. The whole place was empty and they told is we could not sit at the bar with a car seat. They took us to a table in the very back where another family with kids were sitting. There were no more than 12 people in the restaurant. Our car seat wouldn't fit in the booth so they told us to put the car seat at an angle tilted forward so it would fit. We said no and left. The food always sucks and the staff doesn't seem to care.

1,Jessica B.,"Fall River, MA",13,83,110.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"Short version: The food was cold, one item was rotten.Look at my pictures. I'm here to save you guys from this disgusting place; you have been warned. Let me tell you their advertising team did a darn good job at fooling me because their food looked so damn good that I drove 17 minutes to go grab it. The first thing that annoyed me is the fact that there is a huge tip sign on the website when you check out. If I wanted to tip I would've delivered or dined inside, to go orders should never have tips. So now there was a fear that they would spit on my food because I wouldn't tip, so I called instead, THE FOOD: The Jack Sliders- They gave me something that looks nothing like the picture, it was burned a little, and the sauce was on the side....anyways it was edible so I still ate it, but was it worth 8 bucks?? god no. (picture is provided) The Mash potatoes: yeah that straight up looks like the boxed one, again nothing like the picture.I took one bite and threw it in the trash. (picture is provided) Cheddar Mac & cheese: lacking cheese...honestly idk what the heck that was, but it was edible so I ate some of it.(picture is provided) Basket Of Fries: Limp and cold, my daughter had no issues eating it, she didn't finish it though. It would've been nice if it was nice and fresh. Loaded Potato Skins: This was the main reason I even came here. My husband absolutely loves them, and they butchered it. It was cold, soggy, burnt, and oily. I hate that I didn't take a picture of it. French Onion Soup: I usually get it at Panarea bread and love it. Idk I guess I had a higher expectation from tgi, From the moment I saw it I saw how soggy the bread was, I mean I guess Its expected, but it was lacking the cheese that I saw from the picture, but I was still hopeful. But the damn thing was rotten.  Thank you TGI Fridays for sucking...honestly, if the restaurant business dies, it wouldn't be due to millennials, it would be due to the money hungry CEOS that gives us crappy food like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
3,Michael M.,"New Bedford, MA",71,4,1.0,1.0,2017-12-27,"Stopped in for a quick bite and a drink while running some errands.  I wanted to try one of the signature drinks on the handcrafted cocktails list to be informed that a few sections of the drink menu are not available because they don't have the ingredients.  I understand that happens but the bartender was rather snippy in reply to questions.  I ordered an alternative which was mediocre.  We placed an order for the Friday's appetizer combo which was very disappointing.  For the price tag it was not a value.  The boneless buffalo tenders were so small I wouldn't even call them chicken nuggets.  Literally smaller than a quarter and mostly breading.  I tried to order a second drink on the menu and when I asked questions, the ingredients I was being told they put in it were no where near what I was reading in the menu.  I then gave up, never ordered the second drink and asked for the check.  I never received an itemized receipt detailing what I paid for.  Ultimately, I am very disappointed and truly wish I walked out within the first 5 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-north-dartmouth,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
