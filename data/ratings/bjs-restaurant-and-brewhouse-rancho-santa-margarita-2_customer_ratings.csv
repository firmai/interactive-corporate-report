431,J A.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,5,,3.0,2012-01-06,"I LOVE BJ's pizzeria.  I have been excited to see this one built in my neighborhood.  I could not wait for it to open.  BUT I have been there three times and have had bad experiences each time. FIRST TIME Waiter wasn't sure of the menu, pizza and food was delivered fine, although it took a long time. SECOND TIME Waiter seemed new.  Appetizer was brought out about 5 minutes after the pizza, with no apology, no explanation, just ""oh, they get busy and get confused"".  This was a Friday night and I know they are new, but they need to get their act together. THIRD TIME This was the worst.  I asked what kind of non BJs beers they had, the waitress had no idea.  When she returned, she said the bartender was busy so couldn't tell her right now.  Finally I went to the bar and asked myself (I wanted to see what the Lost Abbey beer was, which the bartended said was an IPA, but Lost Abbey doesn't even make IPAs).  I ordered a BJs beer instead (Grand Cru, which BTW, is very good).  It took over a half hour to get my beer.  We ordered pizza (medium BJs fave, mini cheeseburger pizza and a kids cheese only) and two salads (side salad w/dressing on the side and a dinner salad with chicken).  It took almost an hour and a half to get our food.  The two salads came out (the one that was supposed to have the dressing on the side was smothered with it, the chicken one had no dressing at all).  We told the waitress but she made no attempt to fix the problem.  Finally the medium pizza came out (seriously, after an hour and a half) room temperature.  The waitress said the other two pizzas had been under the warmer and needed reamade (at least another 30 minutes) but we asked for those to just be reheated (we have small kids who were DONE in the restaurant).  The medium pizza was room temp, the cheeseburger pizza didn't have the pickles on it and the kids pizza had NO SAUCE.  We were extremely disappointed. I think they are still training their staff right now, as well as their kitchen, but they are completley overwhelmed.  I haven't talked to ANYONE who has gotten their correct orders, and the management isn't trying to help out at all.  We won't go back for a while, hopefully not until they have the kinks worked out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=440,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.252,2.16
283,Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1253,506,242.0,1.0,2012-01-08,"I thought we shared this review....... but I guess not. The visit was about a month after their opening. My wife and I, and our family, can forgive ""first week confusion, jitters and mayhem"" from a new franchise location........ but I can't forgive the marketing ignorance of a manager, who after being told that everyone's food came to the table cold, my wife's order for vegetarian came with pork, and her re-order of a half baked potato and soup took another 30 plus minutes....... could only see his way to give our table a paultry ""half off just one entree!?""  Sorry BJ's....... we frequent the Irvine location and Laguna Woods, Huntington Beach and other locations, and have never had such bad food or service from the kitchen. The server guy was nice, but was ""sucker-punched"" by his kitchen staff and manager. I asked my wife..... ""If the manager had refunded the meal in full, would you return?"" Her answer......? No. It's that simple, and if you knew my wife, you'd know she wasn't going to change her mind. I'm still trying to figure out from which industry this restaurant manager came from....... I'm guessing ""Industrial Fasteners and Hardware?""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=280,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.988,2.12

We also ordered the tomato and cheess salad. In the picture on the menue it looks like a huge meal. When it came out it wasnt enough to feed a rabbit. We kindly complained and the Manager took it off the menu. After she did our waitress gave us a an attitude and from then on totally rushed us. She asked if we wanted desert 5 minutes after our main course came out and when we said ""no thanks"" she came back and dropped the check when we werent even finished eating.

We got seated and it took a while for the server to come over. Being a server as well I understand things but I left thinking what the hell?! She asked for our drink order. Water with lemon please. I saw her write it down. Side salads came out...um where is my water?? I'm practically done with my salad and FINALLY the water comes WITHOUT LEMON THAT I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR. When my boyfriend ordered his pizza he asked for a side of ranch thinking that it would save her an extra trip. Of course it never came. Back to the lemons, we asked for some and asked again, and asked again. Really?!! Finally I thought it was rude that in the middle of eating my pizza she asks if I want dessert. If you really are a server you wait until your customer is done otherwise you come off as rude and trying to get rid of them.

That's the only things I'll order as I've not heard many good things about the rest of the food they serve. Having said that - I ended up here with Bill, Norma, Miranda and another friend for dinner this past weekend. NFL playoffs on all the screens in the house and the place is packed. I'm not expecting much as far as customer service goes however our server proved me wrong.  I forget his name but he was on the ball. Friendly, efficient and even caught a mistake made by the kitchen. No worries though as he adjusted the bill even before presenting it.  I had pizza and beer - which didn't disappoint. Beer was cold and pizza was hot - toppings galore and not burnt.  Typical BJ's experience. For me that is. It seems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=140,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.288,2.12
348,John M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,34,,1.0,2012-01-22,"I visit the Huntington Beach location often since it's near my office so I was glad BJ's opened a location near my home.  I've been to this RSM location twice now, but this past Friday's visit will be my last. The waiter was totally confused and had to recheck our order twice.  The food for the four of us came out at four different times, but the worst part was the chicken was RAW.  My friend ordered half a chicken sandwich and soup, thank God it was half a sandwich or he would not have seen it until he had taken a bite.  The manager came out and apologized, yet it still took another 20 minutes for them to bring a new sandwich, at which time everyone else at the table had already finished their meals. I ordered a turkey burger with a cup of soup to start.  The soup arrived after the turkey burger, and the burger was dry as a desert.  The manager did comp the raw chicken sandwich, but it was to little to late. There are way to many other other options out there competing for my dining dollar to have to put up with this nonsense.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=300,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.988,2.12

So far since opening, I have walked out twice with my guests, as both times we were seated by the hostess, and then sat for 15 minutes with no waiter coming by, (yes TWICE) with 30 waiters standing around? They have excellent pizza, but they're service (aside from the takeout workers) is attrocious. I have ordered the same pizza, (one they advertise quite regularly) probablly 30 times, and I have had it actually made correctly about 10/30. Not sure for a new restaraunt why they are not on top of their game? I even had an order come out to $9.25, at first I gave the girl $10.00, but then found a quarter. I told her, ""nice I have a quarter!"" she proceeded to tell me she could'nt give my dollar back and take the quarter because, ""she already keyed it in the register and didnt want her drawer uneven"" WOW!

421,Sarah D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,19,,2.0,2012-01-23,"Came here with some friends to celebrate our birthdays. We were seated right away and were asked for our drink order. Our server was very nice and we got our drinks promptly but had to wait a while for our meal orders to be taken. While we waited for our food it was a bit difficult to talk because the music kept cutting in and out. It would be very quiet then blasting! I had the Grilled Chicken Pasta which was alright. There wasn't too much sauce on the pasta and the broccoli was a bit undercooked. Also, the chicken was tough and not as hot as I would have preferred. Something redeeming though was the Pizookies my friend and I got for our birthday. Those were very warm and fresh out of the oven.  However, if I wanted to go to BJ's, I'd definitely go to the one in Laguna Hills.

This is a good addition to the RSM area since the only other one in South county is in Laguna Hills. We sat in the bar area and were served right away. Food and service were both on target with other BJ's locations. We started with a pitcher of Jeremiah red, and I ordered chicken tortilla soup (which was AMAZING by the way) and the boy ordered a huge bacon cheeseburger. Total bill for us was 35.00.....it seemed a little steep and we both commented to each other that we thought that BJ's has raised their prices recently.  I also have a love/hate relationship with the menu since it has calories listed for everything. It's like you want to know how many calories your meal has, but deep down inside you really don't want to know! I'm surprised that some of their pizzas have less calories than their salads. I enjoy BJ's because they realty do have a huge menu with something for everyone, and the food is consistently good. I will watch the prices on the menu though because they have jumped up!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=300,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.2199999999999998,2.12

Drinks too long to get to our table. Food was not warm by the time it got to our table.

465,Kate B.,"TRABUCO CYN, CA",0,11,,4.0,2012-02-12,"We ate here in a busy Friday night with our two boys. One of our kids is well behaved and one is a little monster. Our server was very helpful. She could tell it was best for us to get our order in quickly. She took our drink order and the kid's meal orders while we looked at the menu. Our food came quickly. My skinny 5 year old who eats nothing, will turn down cake and ice cream, ate his entire meal of garlic bread and mini corn dogs. The 2 year old terror loved his pizza. I had a drink that was good but knocked me on my butt from being strong ( I rarely drink). I had jumbalaya- pretty good- and huge portion, could have split. My hubby had ribeye. He said his steak was meh, but he loved his horseradish mashed potatoes.  The two year old them began to loose it and the staff helped us get our bill, to go boxes and get out of there.  My favorite restaurant is mastro's, so I am used to good service....I saw very good service l around us. Obviously, the steaks are not comparable, but for the price and ability to bring the kids, this a place was great. Good, fast, friendly service with pretty good food.

471,OC C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",27,19,1.0,1.0,2012-02-19,"While the food at Bj's is consistently good from location to location, regretfully, the service is not.  I had already lowered my standards for bad service due to experiences at other BJ's locations but the RSM restaurant sets a new low.  To say their service is slow and the wait staff is apathetic  would be a compliment.  I took my family of four there on a Sunday night.  After a 30 minute wait to be seated, it was another 5-10 before our presence was even acknowledged.   I let that slide and after ordering, things seemed to get better.  An expeditor brought out the food but after that, our family might as well have been on deserted island.  Don't go there thirsty because once you finish your first round of water, you'd be better off taking your empty glass to the bathroom to refill it.  After waiting another 20 minutes, I finally was able to flag down our server, who looked utterly surprised that I would interrupt him.  I think he forgot he was our waiter.  So I asked him to bring my son a kid's size Pizookie, which was the reason the kids picked BJ's int he first place.  15 minutes passed by and....nothing.  How long does it take to scoop ice cream and put it on a cookie?  Finally I figured we'd have to invest another 20 minutes to get the check if we waited around. So much to the dismay of my son, I flagged down the waiter again (same shocked look as before on his face) and asked for the bill.  I'm ashamed to admit that after waiting for a total of 40 minutes to even be acknowledged, i considered walking out on the bill.  Had my kids not been with me, i probably would have.  I ended up explaining the situation to the manager and he comped my kid's meals.  But the Pizookie never came out.  My son was devastated.  NEVER AGAIN.  STAY AWAY from this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.18,2.16

Serious service issues,  the kitchen can't time even two meals.  The waiters (the 3 I've had) should consider other careers. Its more of a place to collect material for a stand up routine than a place to eat. We got our food and then waited 5 minutes for silverware.  10 minutes after the silverware I got my Nutty Brunette.    We waited for 34 minutes for our check.   We started to build a tepee on the pizza holder to attract the attention of anyone.  We had three beer glasses, three plates and napkins stacked about 15 inches high and the waiter still walked by us 4 times. Comical but sad.  When I run low on material a quick visit to BJ's fills up my book. Here's a suggestion.  Sit outside and order delivery service from Tutto Fresco.

Around 13:15(1:15pm) I got up and found a manager and said ""we needed to go and I left $3 dollars on the table for our server if you can find her"" His responses "" What about the Pizza?"" My response"" what pizza?"" He goes"" I saw you eat a pizza"" Now, if I did, I wouldn't have a problem paying for it, but since I never got it I shouldn't have to wait 45minutes to NOT get it than pay for it. I laughed at his comment and tried to leave with my girlfriend, and which point the manager said "" if I leave without paying he will call the cops"" I looked and him and said"" go for it"" Needless to say he does call the cops and I get pulled over on my way to drop my girlfriend off at work. I explain to the police officer that we never received our pizza and we had to go.  Long story short, after reviewing the videos the cops determined that the server took the pizza to the wrong table and that the manager thought I was that table( I have a Mohawk with full sleeves of tattoos, pretty sure I'm noticeable) After that experience, my girlfriend convinced me to try it again so I do with similar problems. Slow to take our order, slow to bring it out. Wrong bill total. Double charged for beer, again server claiming I consumed it. Than pizza was colder than my beer. Order wings and pizza and got the pizza first and Wings at the same time the waitress took out empty pizza bin. Seriously after reading the reviews on yelp, I'm amazed that they are still open.  If only had one restaurant server worst than this, and that was at DICKs last resort, And even than dicks gets my order correct.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=360,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.052,2.4

I thought a lot of the negative reviews were over exaggerated by people who don't really Yelp and just wanted to bitch. I had a good dine-in experience the first time and have gotten take out on quite a few occasions since. No major problems. Lately though... BJ's needs to get their act together.  On several occasions I've brought home food only to find that things aren't made properly or there are key components missing. I mean, who wants a Cobb salad that's missing the turkey, bacon and croutons? I think that's just called a garden salad, no? Another time, there was barely any salad in my tray. For $11. No joke. it was the size of a side salad with a few sparse ingredients sprinkled on.  Last week was the final straw. We ordered two salads to share for dinner and come home to find our Italian chop salad to be missing ALL of the meat and cheese and Cobb salad to be missing a couple of other things. Furious, but holding it together, I call and let them know. The MANAGER states that ""it's not even on the menu anymore"" and that the ingredients aren't all available. I told her she shouldn't have sold it then.  They refunded my money but the manager was not at all professional, made excuses and was condescending. Because I love the BJ's brand and wonder what the hell is going on with this location, I'm going to contact their head office and let them know that there are some major problems going on here.

278,Melissa S.,"San Clemente, CA",44,105,20.0,2.0,2012-09-14,"Before there was BJ's, there was a failed!TGIF in this same location. While I wouldn't call myself superstitious, I do think that they should maybe burn some sage or something...perhaps there's some lingering negative energy in here.  Or, perhaps this BJ just sucks. Last Friday myself and three friends popped into the bar for a quick drink. I ordered a Meyer's rum with cherry cola, which was served to me in a small glass filled nigh to the brim with ice. Sadly, my drink was also lacking the cherry grenadine that would have helped mask the rum's strong flavor. I was a little surprised that the bartender got it wrong, as he made a bit of a show of pouring the rum into the (did I mention it was tiny?) glass. Also, we were the only ones seated at the bar. So, I asked him if he had any cherries, hoping he might remember what I actually ordered. He replied that yes, they had them, and stared at me like a deer in headlights. I then had to ask if I could get some, and he brought them back. No offer to add grenadine, but left too fast for me to ask. A young lady who was also bartending saw me trying to squeeze the juice out of my cherries into my glass, and she kindly asked if I might like some grenadine! That girl was a gem and the only good thing about the experience. Without asking if we wanted anything else (and all four of us were almost finished with our drinks) he brought us our checks and shortly thereafter, was relieved by another bartender...I know he wanted a tip for his ""services"", but I felt that it was very rude to try to force us to pay when we weren't finished, especially without asking if there was anything else he could get us since it was still a good couple of minutes before he left. I work in a restaurant and bartend some nights; I'm not asking for anything that I wouldn't ordinarily do myself in their shoes. In a way, it was probably for the best that I didn't get a second beverage -- the new bartender was obnoxious, loudly talking over the patrons in the bar-area so he could shout at his work-friends. My group was annoyed by him so we left.  I really wish I had gotten a beer instead of an awful mixed drink that I payed about $8 bucks for and didn't even get me buzzed.

We've been there a couple of times and last Friday night is going to be the last time I'm sorry to say. We got there shortly after 8:00pm and the place was packed. After a short wait we were seated. The waitress announced that this was her first night ""working without help"" and to ""be nice."" We ordered drinks and an appetizer. When we were first seated, I noticed a large corner booth across from us was vacant and the table was FILLED with dirty dishes, dirty glasses, leftover food, etc. We waited for our drinks ... and waited and waited. It took an inordinate amount of time for them to arrive. My son mentioned that he only saw one bartender behind the bar. Our appetizer actually came out before we got our drinks. They finally came ... one margarita, a taster of four mini beers and a rootbeer. The margarita was awful ... way too sweet and not at all like it had been the last time we'd been there. The taster of beers didn't seem to be the flavors my husband had ordered. They were supposed to be four different kinds yet two of them were identical. Dinner continued the downward trend ... my son's hamburger was devoid of any flavor and he was so grossed out by it that he couldn't stomach finishing it. My husband and I thought our tacos were just okay. I never once saw a manager walking around and they seemed to have really scaled back on the amount of staff on hand because it sure wasn't like it had been when the place first opened. The table with the dirty dishes stood there the ENTIRE time -- from the time we were seated to the time we left. Occasionally a waiter would go over there and pick up one glass or stand there and stare at the table and walk away. Apparently they have no staff who has the responsibility of clearing off and cleaning dirty tables. Toward the end as we were getting ready to leave, I noticed a lot of tables just sitting there with dirty dishes piled up. It was disgusting. I guess the wait staff was supposed to clean tables as they had time and apparently no one had time or was paying attention. Had I seen a manager, I definitely would of complained as that is just plain unacceptable!

I usually have a good experience with BJ's in Orange County but the location in RSM was very disappointing to say the least. I placed a curbside order on 4/21/13. The young ladies that helped me were nice but just before leaving I noticed that my order was not correct. I had to call them back on the curbside number and point out that  that the baked potato I had order wasn't in the bag. I was then told that someone forgot to put the order in for the baked potato and that they were sorry about the error and they would fix it right away. So I decided to eat the sandwich I ordered while I was waiting and then noticed that it was missing the avocado and bacon. So this time I went into to tell them about the additional error. The young lady was sorry and said she would bring me the missing sandwich items right away. So I went back out to my vehicle to wait for the missing items.  After about 25mins of no signs of the missing baked potato or sandwich items I went inside again. The young lady apologized and went into the kitchen to check on the potato and get me the avocado. She returned after a few minutes with the most pitiful presentation of avocado I have ever seen. The last thing you want to see as a customer that has just spent an extra 30mins waiting for food that isn't correct on a supposed fast curbside pickup. Another worker walked the avocado into the back to ask for it be fixed and check on the hold up on the potato. After about 3 minutes she returned to tell me that a manager was coming to talk to me.  The manager finally arrived to inform me that they were now out of baked potatoes and that he was sorry. He offered to sub the potato for something else. At this point I was pretty much over the possibility of waiting for them to get me something else, especially with it taking over 15mins just to get a decent side of avocado. Which when was brought again was still lame but I was over the whole incident at this point. The manager ended up removing all my charges for the potato I never got and the sandwich, but honestly he should have offered something additional for the 40min wait time after I arrived at the curbside deliver area. BJ's you need to step up the level of customer service. Make sure your chefs are making an awesome presentation on everything especially for the orders that got botched by the staff.

All you do is get a glass n go to the tap. After about 15 mins my beer came out and we were told our pizookies will come out shortly. After about 10 more minutes I went to ask for the manager however the hostess said she would take care of it. Fine, just get my pizookies out. The waitress then asked me 'what's the problem?' Keep in mind this is the first time she has checked up on us. I told her and her reasoning was 'well other tables have waited over 20 minutes as well'. Don't see how that's helping the cause because now I know I'm probably not the only one upset with the service here. Finally they came out and we asked for the check in anticipation of it taking a long time. Ends up the manager comp'd our pizookies because it took over 30 minutes for them to come out. I would assume the manager would at least stop by to explain/apologize for what happened, especially considering I asked for him/her earlier.

And when were you gonna tell us this? So bitched like crazy to the manager and he sent the BEST waiter over! Its was like night and day! I believe his name was Daniel. He was on it, best service ever. Manager apologized and we got the drift the previous waiter has had so attitude problems before. Dude needs a new profession! Daniel was the man though and I will probably request to sit in his area next time cause he was so attentive and the manager was sincerely apologetic was he was notified and comped us which was unexpected but very nice.

I work for a business that gets needlessly slammed by customers who only had a bad experience because of their own impossible to please attitudes. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt before I do this.  I love BJ's. The food is always great, so I was naturally really happy when the new arrival came to RSM. Problem is, The food is always yummy, but every time I go there is ALWAYS a problem with the staff and service. Whether it is that the food comes out wrong, or the service is really really slow, or the server is not very helpful or nice.  I just went there for lunch today and we had to wait 30 min just to order food, our server was given way Way too many tables so she didn't come to check on us and once we put our food in it took 50 min just to get to the table.  If this kind of thing happened only once in a while I don't really mind. Everyone makes mistakes or gets really busy and we all know that stuff happens. However when it happens 75% of the time, I feel like someone needs to say something so it doesn't keep happening.

It's hard to put a finger on exactly what the issue is, but if I had to garner a wager, it would be my belief that this locations mentality is ""turnkey, turnkey, turnkey"", because this place is pretty darn busy most of the time (probably because one thing RSM lacks in is quality, family restaurants).  However, this translates into a rushed kitchen, and a rushed kitchen tends crank out food, assembly line style, and thus quality control suffers. This was evident the other evening when our large pizza came out to our table, luke warm, and not cooked in the middle (i.e. raw dough).  Easy fix,...waiter was very friendly and apologetic, no questions asked to get us another one...but it even took longer to get than the first one.  On the plus side, this one was done and tasted great, but the re-fire of 30 minutes made for an uneven experience as the other guests at our table had finished their meal by the time the second pizza came out. For once, I tried something off the 'light-menu'.  I had the BBQ Bison Burger (550 cal, $9.95) and was very pleased.  It was actually very tasty, and I give a thumbs up to the calorie conscience slaw. Appetizers to our table included the potato skins, which were in fact both crispy and not very greasy (something you normally don't expect with this dish), so thumbs up here as well. Service was above average.  We scored a fine young man who checked on us constantly. So the drawbacks?  Feels somewhat chaotic and loud in there at times, and you can't help but feel like they are in-fact rushing you at times to get you back out the door.  Over the course of the handful of times I've been there, there has also been at least something wrong with one or more dishes....either cold, sometimes missing items, substitution requests ignored, etc...Like I said, the kitchen expediter isn't paying attention and just pushing stuff out.  Slow down, read the tickets, double check, and things should improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=220,2.4,2.35,2.35,2.252,2.37

The bar is serviced well and they take care of their customers promptly. The meu is ok, not perfect by any means, but I am satisfied with it. As a single person, I am less picky by myself when not entertaning guests. Their best item on the menu in my opinion, Parmesean Crusted Chicken is great. The burgers are very good, but the Bison burger is best and you can order just like the other burgers. Like I said, not a great menu for a serious night out, but good enough for me. Now for the best part, the beer. They have a great selection and as a beer lover, I am always in a good mood here. You should be able to find what you want here or very close to it. The atmosphere here is very good, I enjoy Friday/saturday evening here at the bar for a couple beers and maybe dinner or an apetizer. I see a lot of critical reviews on this place, not sure what the issue is.

I don't know if it was a full moon that night but the whole dining experience was off.  Our waitress greeted us as we were seated and took our cocktail order.  I had ordered a glass of wine and and my dining companion ordered the beer sampler(four samples).  We waited for 20 minutes before flagging down our waitress.  Her excuse was they were washing the glasses and needed to quick freeze to chill the glasses. Huh? The restaurant was not that busy and to run out of bar glasses? That's a first and definitely a poor excuse!  Our appetizers arrived first so we were sitting eating our appetizers but still no drinks. Finally, half way through eating our appetizers they finally brought our drinks.  They only brought three of the sample beers and said that they were waiting for one more glass.  One of my biggest pet peeve is when the waitstaff takes away dishes not asking if we are done yet.  They removed my companion's appetizer plate when he wasn't even done eating!  Another waitstaff removed our appetizers and there were still appetizers on the plate!!  So annoying!  My entree(seared ahi salad) was okay but my companion's hamburger was overdone and dry!  Management...please take note!   You will lose a lot of diners if you do not address these issues!  We have frequently dined at the BJ's in Laguna Hills and was very satisfied with the service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=420,2.48,2.4,2.4,2.12,2.432

216,Vanessa C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",230,52,100.0,2.0,2013-09-18,"This review is mostly for the food. I went here with a group of friends on a weekday for dinner. Like other BJ's restaurants, the restaurant is casual and very loud. It seems like a lot of people come here after work for beer or happy hour.  The menu is huge. There are appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pastas, and entrees. Whenever I see this vast of selections on the menu, I get a little nervous. It seems like it would be harder for restaurants to perfect each dish if they offer so many choices. However, it is a chain, so I'm sure everything is shipped, frozen, and prepared according to the specifications set by the restaurant corporation Since it was a bit overwhelming to flip through the entire menu, I stuck to the Enlightened Entrees. Each dish in this section is under 575 calories. I chose the Moroccan Spiced Salmon. The menu described it as oven roasted salmon with served over roasted vegetable couscous and drizzled with roasted red pepper sauce. When I received my entree, I was surprised. I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary, but my dish didn't even look very appetizing.The plate was huge so everything looked tiny on the plate. (Refer to picture below-- look at all the white space on the plate!)  Also the roasted red pepper sauce should really be called ""thin, runny, watery mess."" My entire dish was drenched in this sauce and it made my cous cous and vegetables very, very sweet and soggy. I wish there were more of the almonds to provide a crunchy texture, but sadly I didn't taste it. The salmon was alright, nothing special. For $13, I'm not sure this dish was worth it.  We also shared the trio of Pizookies. Bj's is famous for their cookie and ice cream creation, and I remember really loving this dessert in the past. The pizookies we got were SO sweet. I am a crazy sweet tooth, but this was way too sugary even for me.  Service was pretty good. Our server was attentive, and she brought our food and drinks out quickly.  The sad part is that BJ's will continually receive a lot of customers in RSM because it's located in an area that lacks great casual restaurants--especially large, popular restaurants known for their lunch specials, happy hour and beer. It's in a convenient location, it's good for groups, and it's open late.

It comes off as if it's a constant  issue regarding employee scheduling. It should be easily known the busiest hours and there should be enough staff. Otherwise, the managers on duty need to be in the kitchen running orders or cooking. I arrived this evening, placed an appetizer order, and food order. The server asked to start with drinks but fearing we wouldn't see her for another extended amount of time, I ordered everything and clearly stated our mozarella sticks would be an appetizer. After waiting well beyond the time for mozarella sticks, I told the nearest person who came our way, busboy, to cancel our appetizer since the food should be coming out soon. Or so I thought! Shortly after, a staff member came over with a salad that was apart of my child's meal. I told her that I wanted our appetizer cancelled since we are now receiving part of a meal that was intended not to be an appetizer. The server comes over and attempt to state that the kitchen is backed up and it's within the amount of time since our meals were not on the table. Seriously!?! One adult and one child, an appetizer, and two meals! The child's salad had come out. What are the odds the kid will eat cheese sticks and the rest of the meal at this point!?! What do we still need an appetizer for when the food is starting to come out, and it's only two people eating tonight. After I refused the appetizer, our server did not return to our table until after we were done eating our meal. sThere was no return visit ater the food had been brought to the table to see if we needed anything or to inquire about the food's taste. When the plates are practically emptied is not a time to ask is everything alright.  I would just like the restauarant and server to know, your service is crappy. I normally leave a 20-25% tip, because years ago I worked as a server part-time. I couldn't bring myself to do it after our server never came to check on us after the meal arrived to the table. I left the crappy 15% tip which was only $2.25 to reflect the crappy service received and due to the restaurant constantly being slow and seeming to have a ""it's alright to not provide service"" attitude. You will not have to worry about me refusing another appetizer, because we will not be back. I know I used a kid's free meal coupon, but I was prepared to leave a tip on the amount before the coupon which would had been $4 or $5 on our $20 meal prior to the coupon difference. Had we received our appetizer before the meal started to arrive, I would had probably left a $5 or $6 tip.  Even after I asked for the general manager's card from the hostess as we were leaving, there was no acknowledgement from the hostess booth about a manager-on-duty being available to respond to my concerns. The food taste was fine, but there is no way I will be at this place again.  It's almost as if they hired the people who use to work at the El Torito's, and thank goodness that place closed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=380,2.68,2.43,2.43,1.9920000000000002,2.5300000000000002
347,L L.,"Secaucus, NJ",2,36,6.0,1.0,2013-11-15,"My boyfriend and I have been here maybe four times since we moved to RSM. Our last two visits were in the last month. We used to go to BJ's often before we moved, but every time we've come to this location, we've had a bad experience -- a couple of the more common issues are service is slow and we always had to ask for eating utensils because some tables had them and some didn't (they'd even serve the appetizers without realizing we didn't have utensils). Even when it was relatively dead, our servers were nowhere to be seen. It'd make sense if they were really busy and hadn't come by yet, but when it's not busy, it just seems like they're really inattentive or messing around out of sight or something. Oh, we've gotten their mushrooms appetizer a couple times and it seems like they're using button mushrooms or something. They're always so tiny and the fact that they use a huge plate for it only emphasizes how small they are and how few you get. Not worth the cost, in my opinion. I finally decided to say something to the manager on our previous visit (we went once more last night, but I'll get to that shortly). We went on a Friday night and they were really busy, as expected. I ordered a ribeye and BF got the chicken fried steak. His steak was really dry and mine was way undercooked (I got it medium rare and this was nearly raw), which was a big portion of it considering about half of it was fat. I don't mind eating a little fat with my steak, but I wasn't going to eat pure fat. I cut most of it away and also the raw part and ended up with a piece that was half the size of my palm, only a quarter of the steak's original size. I don't know how the cook could've picked that up raw and thought it was a good piece to cook and serve. We barely saw our server because it was so busy and when he showed up, he took my plate away. Not having much to eat, I spent my meal talking to BF while waiting to spot our server and I didn't notice when he was clearing the table. There goes all the evidence of my ""steak."" I asked to speak to a manager and he tried to tell me that ribeye was a fatty cut and I said it wasn't like I was expecting NO fat, but most of it was fat and inedible (at least for me; I don't mind a bit of fat in a bite, but like I said, I won't eat just fat. That's kinda gross). I also mentioned that BF's steak was super dry. He offered to take off half the cost of the meal, but much to my dismay, BF interjected and said it wasn't necessary. I think my steak was like $20 and I was really peeved that we paid that much for a steak that was mostly thrown away and uncooked. The manager stopped us on our way out and handed me a $15 gift card, which was nice of him, but we weren't sure if we were going to come back. Yesterday, we stopped by again to use the gift card. Originally, I said we could use it for beer because my boyfriend enjoys BJ's beers, but we decided to give their food another shot. It was far less busy than our previous visit, though it felt like whoever showed up thought it was kids' night; there was no shortage of children running around, crying, and playing in the revolving doors (the hostesses just looked on and busied themselves with something at their station). I don't mind kids, but I do mind parents who let their kids run rampant.  My boyfriend ordered the ribeye and I thought I'd stick with something ""safe"" so I ordered the BJ's bacon burger with a lettuce wrap (avoiding bread right now). His ribeye came out with the amount of fat I'd expect and was cooked perfectly (he likes his rare. but he wouldn't even touch my steak last time). My burger was a really thin patty, something like a White Castle burger. BF took a look at it and said we could've gotten something better at Carl's Jr. and for cheaper. The round, puffy shape of the lettuce wrap really hid how small the patty was. Knowing I was disappointed (again) and that I was envying his perfect ribeye, he gave me a few pieces of it (he's so sweet). We've sworn off BJ's for now. Every time we've gone, it seemed like they were understaffed (and we've been going over a span of months, so I'm surprised they still haven't figured out how many people they need for a particular night...and are they seriously not reading these reviews?). We might visit the bar, but I don't want to waste any more money on their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=300,2.6,2.42,2.42,1.924,2.492

After about 10 minutes our waiter (who was training) came back over & asked what we ordered cause he forgot! Another server was in ear shot & came over to assist. When I said I had ordered a Cab he said ""our house wine is"".........and it wasn't Greg Normans! OK, he explains to us that this is our waiter's first day & yadayadayada. You got a house wine or you don't it's one or the other! Anyway, after a long wait for simple food we receive our lunch. Well, I'll stick to the appetizers because my salad & flat bread lunch was horrible. Lettuce is cheap & I had the smallest salad I have ever seen & that flatbread (margarita) was tasteless.

We both ordered the bacon burger one with cheese and one without bacon extra crispy and well done. Well the got that all wrong the patties were way under cooked and they both came with cheese and the bacon was limp and greasy. The bottom bun was filled with grease and the top hard as a rock the order of fry's tasted like fish. When we talked to the manager it was explained to us that everything is cooked in the same oil.

They do pretty good at getting the orders correct (we use 99% take out), only once having them really back up and keep take out people waiting (which, at 30 minutes late was worth noting, but once out of 20+ times ordering isn't a trend) 2. We just have received better food there. I don't order pizza there any longer (coming from Chicago, there are much better ""Chicago style"" places in Orange County), so we usually have pasta, salads, and appetizers. Generally speaking, the food is usually cooked well. I do agree with others that it can get really crowded, and can be a bit expensive, but overall I would give them a higher than average rating, but not an exceptional one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=220,2.24,2.4,2.4,2.096,2.3360000000000003

I met my parents here for dinner Saturday night... called ahead and had our name added to the wait list for 6pm.  We arrived at 6, there were maybe a dozen or less people waiting in the front area.  We were the last to be seated, which... really, in my opinion... we were seated at 6:05 it wasnt really a big deal. I really wish I knew the name of our waitress.  She was slower than molasses running uphill on a cold January morning.   She asked for our drink order... my Dad asked what non BJs beers they had on tap. She wasnt sure, so she said she would find out.  About 10 minutes later she came back with a list.  About 20 minutes after that, he got his beer. Like I said, we sat down at 6:05.  My Dad ordered a Roast Beef Dip, my Mom ordered a Top Sirloin Steak, Medium (pink) with a wedge salad and a baked potato, and I ordered the Top Sirloin Steak Medium Well with a wedge salad with ranch, and rice pilaf. Around 7:00pm, my Dad asked another waitress to please ask the manager to come to our table.  We still did not have our food.  The food arrived just as the manager got to our table, and he told us to let him know how the steaks were.  He said it was a second round, the first round he told the waitress was not acceptable to take out to our table.  I let him know we both ordered the same steak, yet there were two different steaks on our table.  He said he would go ahead and just take both steaks off our bill, and he would include a free dessert for us.  It turns out I had the Top Sirloin and my Mom had the Rib-Eye which tends to have a bit more fat on it, so she was bummed about that.  My moms steak on top being wrong had the wrong side. I also don't understand why if the first round of steaks weren't acceptable to be sent out, how come no one told us?  Not a word.  Our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert, and we informed her the manager said he was going to take care of it.  She was confused by this, so we told her to just go talk to him.  Dessert took another half hour for a simple pazookie.  In the end, we sat at our table from 6:05pm to 8:05pm for a simple dinner.  It was so long, and so slow... it was almost painful. When anything was brought out to our table, it was brought out by someone who was not our server.  The restaurant was pretty full, but definitely had empty tables, and in my opinion had no reason to have us there TWO hours for dinner. What bothers me on top of everything else, is our waitress didnt once apologize.  She was not friendly, she was so incredibly slow and was just clueless in general.  Honestly it was the worst service I think I have ever experienced.  Anywhere.  Ever. I will give my review three stars, because in my opinion the manager, Art, handled everything top notch.  He came to our table and offered to take our food off the bill, and free dessert before we even had a chance to complain.  He was great.  The waitress, was horrific, which is why I just decided to settle in the middle at 3 stars. 5 stars for Art. 0 stars for our waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=80,2.28,2.38,2.38,1.9000000000000001,2.34

191,Erik F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",815,66,329.0,5.0,2014-03-02,"Came for lunch after first trying to have Thai, but finding the place closed. We often go to this BJ's and overall have great experiences - food, service, price. We use a rewards card, have a coupon and gift card so our back up choice wasn't too difficult. The kids got the kids pizza - one cheese and one pepperoni. Both are just like the adult version - fresh, hot and so tasty. I bribed my daughter into sharing some with me by offering to get a Pizookie for dessert.  Meal is $5.95 and includes drink. Good deal in my book.  My wife and I shared new Enlightened items - Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad. They both sounded great. The tacos did not disappoint, but the salad did somewhat. The tacos tasted good with the grilled chicken, cucumber, tomato, red onion, cilantro and a mild feta and Greek yoghurt sauce, not tzaziki, but more creamy and plain. The side was some type of grain salad, maybe tabouleh - very good and bit spicy. The salad was okay. It has romaine, blueberries, grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, pecans, pepitas, red onion and strawberry vinaigrette. The ingredient sound great, but didn't have as much wow factor as I was hoping for. Could use more of the non-salad ingrediants especially cheese and nuts. Also, I was disappointed that the brussel sprouts were not warm. I expected them warm since they are roasted. Besides that they were not cooked or seasoned enough. I know it's supposed to be light, but these should be sautéed in some OO which is a healthy fat. I really like the burnt Brussels at Cucina Enoteca. They would go great here. You can add chicken, shrimp or blackened salmon. Any of those probably would have brought the salad up a star. Emily was a great server and she was taking care of lots of tables. Then comes the pizookie - as always, super good and gone in 60 seconds. Regular chocolate chip soft, gooey and with vanilla ice cream.

It's a beautiful location. Looks fairly new.  We were greeted right away by the hostess. She asked if we were members of their loyalty program. I am not but my girlfriend to my surprise said ""yes I am"". The hostess pointed to a keypad that was sitting on the desk and asked my friend to input her phone number. She did then the hostess looked up from her screen and welcomed my friend by name. I thought that was pretty cool. She sat us quickly at a nice booth for two. Our server greeted us about a minute later. I believe his name was George. He was very friendly and seemed to know his stuff. I asked about Bjs beer (I had never had a Bjs beer before). He went on about an IBU scale, light vs. Dark and hefeweizen being un filtered. It was a little over my head but definitely helped me decide what kind of beer would be right for me. I ordered a top sirloin MR. It was cooked perfectly. The cheddar mash potatoes we to die for. My friend ordered Parmesan Chicken. She let me try it. The lemon butter sauce was so good I could probably put it on anything and everything I ever eat. George was attentive and friendly throughout the experience. I noticed a young women dressed differently walking around consistently being approached by the employees. I assumed she was the manager. She seemed on top of it. I know restaurant Management can be a trying job because my Mom was one for many years. I commented to my friend that it seems managing a restaurant has not gotten any easier through the years. She told me she had spoken to that particular manager before. She said the managers at this location have recently been changed and she felt it was for the better. Upon receiving our bill George asked us if we would like to redeem any of our points tonight. I was not sure what he meant but my friend sure did. She said "" yes please"". Can I please get $25 off. He said sure. Walked away, went to the manager lady said something she walked to computer did something handed George our bill. Low and behold $25 had been taken off.

292,David L.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",29,4,,1.0,2014-08-30,"The service here is hit or miss. The hostess or hostesses that greet you at the door are dismissive and of no use when it comes to tabling. Getting the food you want depends on what you order. If you haven't been to BJ's the pizzas and pastas are usually what people order the most of. Other popular items that are readily available are the appetizers and pizookies. I ordered the Ribeye steak with seasonal vegetables and tomato bisque soup. The rib eye steak was cooked the way I liked it - medium rare - but I doubt anyone orders the steak when they go to BJ's which is why it led me to believe that the lack of flavor coming from the steak was because it sat in the refrigerator too long and the cut was poorly selected. I never got my tomato bisque soup, probably because no one orders tomato bisque soup at BJ's. The service is okay. Again the hostess/hostesses at the front are useless (this is what happens when you hire teenagers to do a job that requires quality customer service).  Our waitress did an excellent job taking our order, she couldn't pour the beer I had ordered, and when she notified me that my soup isn't coming out, she did her best to accommodate me. Even when they brought out our food, my sister had asked for red pepper flakes. They never brought it to her. Because of my tomato soup fiasco, the manager even came out to assist in making my experience better: offering to change the channels on the TV, offering a different side in exchange for the soup, etc. He seemed to be very engaged in satisfying his patrons. All in all, the execution from this BJ's is poor. You need to constantly asked to be helped and even if it's a result of being understaffed, the staff there still can't do their job.

Despite the many empty tables, we waited 15 minutes for a table. Two other parties of 3 were seated before us. How mad would you be? 2) once seated we waited another 10 minutes to see our waiter and place an order. He was clearly overwhelmed and apologetic for the delay. We were cooperative and sympathetic. 3) waited another 20 minutes before one salad was served. We asked where our drinks and the rest of order was. She said she'd check. 4) another 10 minutes and nothing. We flag our waiter who is appalled we have no drinks or other food yet. 5) another 10 minutes and the rest of our food arrives.

I ask for a pizza server and some silverware but it never comes.  6) the waiter flags manager at his own suggestion.

Yeah it all makes sense, but honestly all I wanted was an efficient meal with my family. That should not be hard to fulfill on a particularly slow day. 8) it's now 2:30 and hour and a half after we checked in. We had a pizza, salad, and pizzookie. The discounted bill was the least they could do.  But then I noticed a ""fruit plate"" charged to my bill that I did not order. I decided not to dispute it since it was already discounted, and I don't need anymore attitude from the manager.  But honestly, they need to get their act together. 9) I feel we were patient with their poor performance and apology, but I won't be coming back any time soon.  10) hopefully corporate will notice that this location needs a management overhaul.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=60,2.24,2.31,2.31,2.116,2.2820000000000005

My husband barely ate any of it.  As we were almost finished with our meal our server finally showed up and took our orders for dessert.  Once the desserts arrived, another server placed the 3 desserts on our table.  The problem was the table was so crowded with our appetizer dishes that were never removed in addition to our dinner dishes.  There was very little room.  This other server didn't even make an attempt to remove any dishes, instead she set the desserts down whereever she found a spot on the table and didn't ettempt to remove any of the other dishes even though it was obvious we were done.  She started walking away and I had to ask her to remove some of the dishes.  There were no bus boys in sight or our server coming to remove any dishes.   The family that was sitting at the table next to us had left an hour ago while we were sitting next there and their table was never cleared.  It was a bit gross.  Don't think we'll be back.  Too bad because it's very nice inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=440,2.28,2.25,2.25,2.568,2.262

To start with mine, my Caesar salad was dry and had 1 crouton and no Parmesan cheese, and the plate was dirty. Did I mention our utensils were dirty too? I kindly asked to get a clean plate, and perhaps a little more dressing. They brought it back and the second plate was also dirty. The third time they finally got it right.  My stuffed potato was dry, no sour cream or green onions, just smothered in cheese and soggy bacon. My friend ordered ribs with no sauce, she seriously told the waitress 5 times, no sauce. They brought the ribs back with sauce, ugh. My son didn't get his fries with his dinner and the macaroni and cheese was so dry he only took 2 bites (which is unheard of).

Well when we were finally sat down 10 minutes later, the server took forever to get to us and take an order for drinks, probably close to 20  minutes. Then the drinks took a long time to arrive, like another 20 for one water and one pepsi. She then took our food order.  My bf and I split the 9"" buffalo chicken pizza and a bacon and blue burger. The bacon and blue burger came split in half since that's what I asked for. However, the burger was so poorly assembled that all the bacon was on one half of the burger and not the other. I had to go in and redistribute the bacon. Also, it's suppose to have blue cheese, but there was no blue cheese at all. They put in too little blue cheese to call it that.  The buffalo chicken pizza is weird tasting. The crust has a taste of artificial butter. My boyfriend even said ""it tastes like movie theater popcorn butter."" That's disgusting! The cheese they use on the pizza is low quality as well, it hardens in a matter of seconds and they don't use enough on the pizza. The crust wasn't crispy either, which is what I expect from a deep dish pie made with a proper cornmeal crust. Just awful, all of it.  I hated everything about this place.

The kids had soccer games and we didnt feel like cooking. My Daughter, who is 10 years old, decided to go with the Fried Chicken Tenders. After waiting about 30 minutes to get the food, she decided to tear into her chicken. What we found was uncooked chicken. Now, Im not talking about undercooked, slightly pink, or the juices were slightly pink. I am talking about RAW chicken. The type of chicken you would see at your local supermarkets chicken aisle.  After bringing this up to the manager, he said that he would take it back and cook it some more. REALLY?!?!? At least offer to replace it with a new one. Nope, he would just cook that one through. We told him not to bother. He brought out a new one anyways. After explaining to him that her appetite for their chicken had gone, she stuck to french fries, as you couldnt really screw it up.  The only benefit to the meal was that (after my wife lost her cool), they did comp the meal and they did bring her a pazookie. My wife ordered the salad, she said it was pretty good. My son ordered a burger, it had no flavor at all. Not bad, but not good. I had the pork chops. They screwed up my order and the chops were tiny. Not bad, but not something to get if you are hungry.  If you are in the area, and you are just going for the food, save yourself the time and headache and go to mcdonalds across the parking lot. At least you know what you are getting there.

The beer choices are the bomb at BJ's and we always seem to arrive before the Happy Hour is over so we go with the small plates. Tonight we ordered individual veggie pizzas and some avocado rolls. Both were very tasty and you can't beat the price. ($6.00 each) We also had a super fresh kale salad with lots of healthy add-ins like baby Brussels sprouts, fresh cranberries, a small amount of goat cheese, all tossed with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Ask for salt and fresh pepper grinder on the side. Salad is always a good way to damper any guilty feelings about devouring delicious appetizers.  We go to BJ's for relaxed fun, and to indulge in the kinds of foods we would not normally make at home.  Our server was on top of things although it was really busy in the bar. The manager Al came by our table to make sure everything was to our liking. He was very much a 'people person' who appears to enjoy his work and catering to the clientele. By the looks of some of the reviews on this page, perhaps some failed to voice their concerns about their food and were eager to get online and blog negative comments. I have never had a manager at any of the BJ's not listen to my comments. When there is a problem with the food, they have always been more than willing to make it right, or bring me something else. I have been eating at all the BJ's forever and would never walk out dissatisfied because their management would not have it. So, I suggest that the previous reviewers try it out again, talk to management if you have any concerns about the food or service. Be nice and they will be nice in return. This is a great neighborhood location that strives to serve their customers, and they work hard to create a local vibe and of friendliness.   We'll be back because we like the food, service, atmosphere, management, and proximity.  There is no better place to watch sports in all of RSM.

411,Shanel D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,2.0,2015-01-31,"Went to this location this afternoon (a Saturday) with my 2 children, and the place was pretty empty. Yet, when we walked in, 2 other groups were waiting to be seated and the hostess was nowhere to be found. I saw several servers walk by, but no one offered us so much as a ""someone will be with you shortly."" When she finally did arrive, she seemed flustered. We waited to be seated (in an empty restaurant), but my son had chosen to go there so I tried to make the best of it. When we were taken to our seat they tried giving us a small table in the middle, but when dining alone with my kids, I find booths to be easier & more comfortable so I asked for one. She let me take one (they were all empty in that section), but seemed reluctant to do it. Took about 10 min to get a drink order in (2 kid milks & I water). Food order was taken in a timely manner, and the server was friendly enough. However, the food took FOREVER to arrive (1 med pizza with just pepperoni and one kid's corndog meal). There was only one other group seated in my section so I have no idea what on earth took so long! The servers changed shifts during our meal & once again our replacement was friendly enough. But when it was time to pay the bill, my card and the bill folder sat at the end of our table for way too long before she took it to ring it up. She also didn't offer us a bag for our leftovers, even though we had two bulky styrofoam boxes and she saw I was alone with 2 kids in tow, (my daughter is 3, so she def takes up one hand because she holds it when we're walking in the parking lot), and it's kind of difficult balancing two styrofoam boxes in one hand. Thankfully a lovely lady at the curbside pick up station offered me a bag, unprompted, when I asked if I could leave my boxes on her counter while I took my kiddos to the restroom on the way out. She earned an extra star. I wish I would've read these reviews prior to coming here. When it first opened, it was much better, but the service has gone down tremendously. It's a real shame, too, because my son likes BJ's & we live super close by. However, I can't see us returning here again.

It is the closest location to my house and we have ordered here 3 times to go and I have been there once for lunch. We ordered the fish and chips which tasted okay but was really dark and too close to being burnt. They forgot the tartar sauce and vinegar... which is just not cool. My dad had to drive back and get those and they just apologized, that is it! We also ordered the tomato soup which my mother said was really good but really how can you mess that up. I have had the avocado spring rolls which taste great but were packaged poorly and the lid to the sauce was left open and splashed everywhere. The avocado was all brown which does not affect the taste but is very unpleasant to look at. The onion strings were 3.49 and you could see the bottom of the container they were in. Maybe 1 1/2 handfuls at best...ridiculous. The pizza looks okay and tastes good but is cold. When we actually went in about 2 weeks ago it was about 2:00pm and the bar had about 5 people and the tables were empty. Nobody came to seat us and I actually had to shout out after 10 minutes of us standing there feeling very awkward. A server looked at me and just ignored, then a second later a gal came over and seated us. The waitress was grody and kind of trashy looking. She did not care at all and was just very basic.

Then when it did come out my husbands steak was burnt and he asked for it medium. So back it went and another 25 minutes went by. No apologies, no manager stopping by, nothing.  So my son and I had completely finished our food before my husbands even hit the table!!!!! I'm sorry but the turn over of tables is relatively fast at a restaurant like this. If I a saw a couple with a 1 yr old at a table for over an hour and one person had no food while the others had eaten and they r trying to keep there child entertained as a manager I might check that everything is ok.

Well we ordered water and after a few minutes we were served our water (w/ lemon wedge) and placed our order. 40 minutes later, that's right 40 MINUTES later we were served a portion of our breakfast. The potatoes came later because they were not done.  As we were eating our breakfast, we noticed coffee cups going out to other guests. When the waiter brings our bill I ask if they now had coffee. His reply, ""yes my manger went to the Laguna store and picked some up"".  Really?

Nothing out of the ordinary with this gesture but extremely friendly. After he finished drying off our table he came over to my nephew and said all dry! Gave him a high five and said nothing to worry about buddy! This made my nephew night and he was taken from upset to happy. Really nice touch by the busser and the best service provided. The food took a long time to get after we ordered. Wasn't overly busy so not sure why it took so long. We ordered avocado rolls for an appetizer and had it half way eaten before our drinks arrived. My brother n law wished he had a straw to make the empty cup noise because we were left empty majority of the dinner. Our waiter was friendly and nice. He did his best to be attentive to our table but the overall experience really was 1.5 stars. I did give them a half of star for the awesome busser.

We made some selections on the menu, and I ordered a Corona beer (they didn't have it..), so I settled for a Miller Lite ($4).  What California restaurant does *not* serve Corona, a very popular Mexican beer? The water brought to the table had some strange small particles floating in the water. The silverware placed on the table was dirty, and spotted, even wrapped in a black cloth napkin. They need to fix the dish washer machine or do quality control better. The food came. I had a soup (chili) and salad (Caesar). They did not bring any bread or crackers, so I asked for some. Waitress brought two little bags of oyster crackers. The chili tasted like canned chili, the salad was ok. My wife's mother's soup was cold, not hot, and had to be sent back to the kitchen to be re-warmed. We only saw the waitress rarely, never asked how things were. My wife's pasta dish (chicken alfredo) had a hair on the bowl side, so we asked them to re-do it. It came after a bit. On the check, they overcharged us for the lunch pasta dish my wife had, and we didn't notice until we left. It's supposed to be $9.50 and they charged us $15.50.

Sometimes for a date, sometimes for a late night drink, sometimes with friends, sometimes with family. As of recently, there's always a manager walking around or in sight if you need anything. Staff is friendly and seems well trained (I don't believe any of our servers have deserved anything less than 20%) compared to other locations.  I just tried their new magnolia peach beer- sweet, but not too sweet. I love their seared ahi salad for lunch and hubby and I tend to always get a large deep dish pizza to go! We've also recently enjoyed their boneless wings, although I think they could be coated in sauce better. Tomato mozzarella salad is always phenomenal and I love their stuffed spinach mushrooms. Hubby's favorite meal is their Parmesan crusted chicken- I love it as well, can't seem to figure out how to replicate it so we don't mind coming here for our fix. I've always been a big fan of BJs, this location rarely disappoints. My only tip would be to take reward #s immediately at the host stand..

Cons: The side salad was small. half the size of the one at the Laguna Hills location. Not only was it small, it didn't taste fresh. It was ice cold.. like it came out of the freezer. It did not have the fresh crunch that you would expect from some fresh greens. Disappointing. The ribs looked nice but was tougher in texture. I expect that if I am going to pay over $20 for ribs, it should be nice and tender, peeling off the bone texture. Unfortunately, this one was not.

For the amount of calories taken in... that's a lot of sodium. It's not just about the calories, yall. The other nutritional facts are important too! I'm not sure what this dish is supposed to be like, but there was a lot of lemon thyme sauce. It was almost like a stew, everything was drenched in it. The brown rice was really mushy and almost had no texture to it (which is surprising since brown rice has more texture than white rice). Everything else kind of got lost in the swamp of lemon thyme sauce.. which I think was the sodium culprit.

77,Daniel P.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,38,1.0,1.0,2016-10-31,"I have a love-hate relationship with BJ's: The food is always delicious but the service can range from anywhere between good and completely unacceptable. Tonight was one of those unacceptable times. Essentially, they can't handle doing Curbside take-out. Two employees came out at separate times to ask for my name to grab my order, then left me waiting way too long before I went inside to try to pick up my food. At one point, they claimed that even though they both came out to check on me, it got busy. Apparently BJ's training teaches them that when it gets busy, you ignore your curbside customers that have been there longer than the folks who walk in to get their food. It took over 20 minutes to actually pay for and receive my order that was already fully prepared when I first arrived. My recommendation to both BJ's and other potential customers: Just say no to Curbside take-out. -------------- Update 11/11/2016: I originally wrote the above and gave it a 2 star review. At the same time I wrote the review, I also sent in my comments to BJ's corporate. I didn't receive a true apology at the restaurant and it's now been over 8 business days and I haven't received a true apology from their corporate office either. All I was hoping for was a genuine ""we're sorry, we messed up and we'll try to do better next time"" but it seems that's asking too much. If they don't care enough about me to even acknowledge my experience, then I don't feel they deserve any of my respect either.

Everything was rushed. From our conversation with our service to our food being brought out to us. I felt like we were in competition of our seats.  We order the sample platter first and told the service we're on a date night, excited to go on vacation this weekend. She didn't seems really interest in us, but to tell us she just got back from her vacation and that she finished school and graduation. She continue to tell us she usually works at the bar, but likes to waitress sometimes as well. She didn't write down out order, which I thought was impressive, but then came back because she forgot twice what we order. Humm write it down then. She just was all over the place. Once we ordered the sample platter it would of been a little nice to know that it was enough for four people instead of two. Waste of food and I should of taken a picture of it- but I forgot. We wouldn't have gotten it. The only thing cooked on the platter was the avocado eggrolls and mozzarella sticks. The Spanish dip was awful and the buffalo wings weren't even dipped all the way. Then we order a mini pizza/salad to share and wine/beer and she forgot my wine the second time around. The mini pizza wasn't cooked and the cheese wasn't melted at all.  The bottom wasn't crispy like the deep dish we usually get.  Also it didn't come in the deep dish pan like as we order. Maybe this has changed now they served on a plate. IDK She did say sorry and did send it back. The second pizza came out and it was just as bad. It looked like they just reheated it. The reason why you only see two slices in the picture is because we're splitting it and as you can see it's gross. I couldn't eat it. The manager did come by and take the mini pizza off our bill but it's not worth us going back again for any reason. This isn't the first time this has happened, but it's my first time noting it here.

Always sit in the bar as there's always a wait for tables, sometimes we actually leave and drive to another branch as there are no tables, even in the bar.  Friday night was ridiculous, If you don't have children and want to go on a Friday night, go later to avoid the early evening family/school crowd. Twice I went to the bathroom to find a group of children hanging around gossiping and hogging the mirrors/sinks. No one ever seems to check the bath rooms as they are always out of paper and soap.  We found a free table (uncleared) and sat down, had to wait forever someone to notice us who then half cleared the table and disappeared. Had to signal someone to then clear the rest of the table. Then had to call someone else again for menus! I know it's busy, but keep an eye on your tables. Shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for a drink!  Some of the servers are very good, very attentive etc but this guy was terrible. Bad attitude and kept disappearing!  The wings (which I normally enjoy) came with hardly any buffalo sauce and ranch thrown all over them, totally drowning them (I want the choice to add ranch to my wings OR not).  Decided to go for the 'wild' salmon which is $20 which isn't cheap for this kind of restaurant. It was so basic, the vegetables are like what you get on the side of an airplane meal- bland, no seasoning. The fish was over cooked and there was about ONE tablespoon of sauce. It was just so dry (took it home and gave it to the dog)  The other main, fish tacos had Too much sauce! Sort it out chef!  Nearly walked out at the end without paying after having to wait another 15 minutes for the bill (the place had emptied out by then).

It was easy to use and I received an email indicating that my food would be ready at the RSM restaurant at 6:45pm. I arrived with my 2 young sons at 6:45pm to pick up our food and the girl at the takeout counter indicated that they never received my order. I showed her my emailed receipt and she said they never received that order and told me she'd have to place my order again. I also mentioned to her that on the back counter, there were drinks that looked like what I had ordered, but she said they were someone elses. My sons and I waited over half an hour for the new order and when they called me up, I asked the server if the food she was packaging up was fresh and had not been sitting in the warmers since 6:45pm (my original pick up time). She said yes, that she had just gotten them from the kitchen. I agreed to take the food based on the premise that it was fresh. I left at about 7:30pm. I got home about 2 minutes later with my sons and as I was unpackaging the food, I discovered that the food was time stamped 6:26pm which would have been the time that it was prepared for my original pick up time at 6:45pm. The food was cold, my boys wouldn't eat it, and I believe the drinks they handed to me were the ones that had been sitting on that back counter and therefore watered down. I called the restaurant to express my complaint about the service and they indicated that a manager would call me back since they were slammed. I appreciated that, however, its been 2 days with no call back. I haven't been able to get a hold of the Manager. What upsets me the most about this is the fact that the server lied to me and I caught her with the time stamp. This is unacceptable service.

It's pretty decent price for dinner and beer selection is huge~ Definately a go to place for beer lovers! I was surprised to see it crowded for a Tuesday night, but my dad and I were seated pretty quickly. We started off with the BJ's porter, it was malty, chocolaty and full of body. My dad got the pork with pilaf and I got the Buffalo Chicken Pizza (mini size). Food came out pretty quickly despite the business. My pizza was warm and dough was super fluffy. I'm not a huge chicken breast fan, but the chicken was pretty juicy, not dry at all. Loved how the pizza wasn't drenched in sauce, the mini was the perfect amount for me. I tried a piece of my dad's pork and it was juicy and flavorful, the pork is pretty thicc, so it looked quite filling. We ordered the triple chocolate pizookie for dessert since it was $3 off pizookie (Tuesday special). The cookie was piping hot and super chocolaty, ice cream was super rich, definately a guilty sweet treat. The total was around $60, which is not bad at all for 3 beers, two entrees, an a dessert.

To be fair, we have dined in BJs on many occasions and the food has always (until today) been tasty.  You guys had a bad day with us today.  BTW, the meal that my lady ordered was fine with no problems but since we were on a date, I have to award BJs only one star today.  For us, todays experience was a total waste of time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=60,2.92,2.88,2.916,2.372,2.896

It was soggy and goopy and just overall unappetizing. Our server was very apologetic though, and got me a new one. I have to say that it was very fast service and the new one was delicious. The other part of my meal was a churro pizookie. The pizookie itself was fine, but the thing that got to me was that it only had one scoop of icecream while in the picture on the table there was two. We told our server about this issue also and he promptly got us another scoop. The thing that bumps this review up from a three to a four is the impeccable attitude of the server and manager.

We specifically planned to come to BJ's on a Tuesday because they have the special 1/2 price wine and champagne (we got mini champagne bottles for $4.30 ish) and $3 pazookis. When we walked in, I expected to smell cleaning products because they had just opened, but to my surprise we smelled yummy food! I was instantly appetized.  We both ordered one of their lunch specials, a mini pizza 1 topping & salad for $10.95 and an order of buffalo wings ($11.95 ish)  We were pleased that it came with a salad and were excited to dig in! The wedge salad was great, and I ordered the garden salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. The balsamic was amazing, next time I will get a large salad because of the amazing dressing, The pizza was a bit doughy for my liking, I was more into the salad and champagne. Also, the pizza came with chopped up tomatoes on top of my pepperoni, I was a little confused because I did not order chunks of tomatoes, but thats okay because they were good anyway. Be weary of this if you are not a tomato eater. Ohhhh our boneless hot wings appetizer.... Not as good as other places, and they were expensive! Stick to the avocado egg rolls for appetizer instead. Loved how the champagne was served in mini bottles! It pours about 2 glasses and is not flat because it was in an unopened bottle. I asked for a side of orange juice to make mine a mimosa and they waitress brought it right away at no extra charge. My pazooki recommendation  is their classic, chocolate chunk. I order mine well done because I don't like the oozing batter. I suggest ordering your pazooki about 10 minutes before you want it at your table because they have to cook for a bit.

My kids love BJ's & we've normally go BJ's by Laguna Hills mall, which is amazing except for 1 time when they mixed up 1 kids w/fries instead of veggies. No big deal mistakes happen & we had a graduation dinner for my brother with most of family so for the sever to mess up 1 kids side with 27 people to get orders from & 5 being young kids was no big deal. We for the bill & realized they didn't  charge us for 1 kids meal because of that little mistake which no one even cared or complained about we just asked if they could bring out the veggies. So the 1 on El Toro is amazing unfortunately I won't be going to another BJ's after last night. I decided to order BJ's for delivery from this one in RSM on BJ's website.

They not only forgot to bring 9 of the 12 orders they also lied saying they would refund my card bring the missing food & have a manager call me back. I told guy I don't mind paying for I don't need anything back but I need the rest of my order so I can feed my kids. He said ok should be there in 45mins & manger would call me within an hour 1.5HRS at most. Not only did the not bring my entire food that was ordered at 4:45pm they also took almost 3HRS getting the rest of the order to me. No manger ever called. I've called at 8pm last night & told the forget it I went & got my kids food at the restaurant across from my house they were already done eating & about to go to bed. I said don't waist anyone's time but I would like to speak with a manger that was supposed to call me no later than. 7:30pm & I to be refunded for ONLY the items I didn't get since the delivery driver even said he only delivered 3 items. The 3 items he was given for my address. So I call & am understanding about them being busy& a manager not being able to speak to me but I was assured my $ would be refunded for the items I didn't receive. Well I was wrong not only was I not given a refund no one ever called me back like promised. I called today they said they would look into it & have the night manager call me today ASAP. No call ever came so I called again around 6:45pm. That manager said he had no clue what I was talking about & would look into it & me right back. Now that's it's almost an hour later I called back. They put Joy on the phone. The only manager that gave her name. She didn't have a clue either. They're blaming door dash but I know lots of people who order from door dash & have an issue. I've never had an issue with door dash. Door dash was more helpful than BJ's ever was because they kept calling trying to figure a way to fix the issue. The problem was I ordered from BJ's website so I had to deal with BJ's. After 2 days of a run around from BJ's employees & managers it made to where I'll never go to any BJ's again. FYI never order off the BJ's website or app it's a waist of time & $!! If I ever hear from a manager I'll update but I highly doubt I will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2,2.88,2.82,3.004,,2.844
