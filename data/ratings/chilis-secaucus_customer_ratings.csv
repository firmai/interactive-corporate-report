53,John C.,"Mississauga, Canada",255,344,1619.0,1.0,2012-07-18,Bad BAd Bad... This is the first bad review I have. We went to a Chilli's in Chicago and that was a 10/10 but this time around it was a 2/10. The food took  a long time to come out and when it did they gave are soup / app with are dinner all at the same time. Soup was good the steak was cold . The worse steak I have had in a long time . They offered free desert . But I did not go there for desert so the fail. I would think twice about going back to Chill's. It looks like I am not the only to complain about this. So good luck to you if you go here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=40,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

The name (if you've never been before) leads you to believe it is a Tex Mex place....it's not...it's mainly burgers and ribs....and for that their name is forever inexcusable to me! Their ribs suck.....their burgers are okay and benefit from a tasty roll.

I know Chilli's is a chain, but I haven't been to one in a while and the food was better than I remember it being.  I give this Chilli's 4 stars in the category of casual dining/chain restaurants. I mean, I know this is no five-star place, but if your looking for some good bar food at a decent price, I have to say that Chilli's is a great option. The spinach and artichoke dip was delicious, and my burger was great. I was ecstatic to find they had grilled the bun in butter or oil (that's the key) prior to assembling the burger. I topped the patty with swiss, avocado, and bacon (which was crispy and cooked just right). I washed it down with a bud light draft and felt very satisfied- maybe too satisfied... I definitely ate too much.  I have to say that Chilli's was a win, especially since I only had to pay half price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=80,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192

We all made separate eye contact with the people working there as they walked by our table but never stopped. After twenty minutes, we decided to go to Cosi near by. Truthfully, the food was probably better and cheaper then whatever we would've gotten in Chilis, but also much, much faster.

When we finally got our food, I was so anxious to get out of the hell hole that we just dipped as soon as it came out. Of course, they forgot my salad dressing for my salad, and messed up my bf's order.  The other time we went there, it was for a simple dessert. WHAT DESSERT TAKES 45 MINUTES TO MAKE? To top that off all the workers try to avoid my death glares so they don't have to explain the wait. They look like they are socializing with each other more than they are working.

I had a medium ribeye - it was $16, with a side of broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes.To be honest, I was pleased. I didn't expect to be amused by a steak from here, but I give them credit for making the steak medium, being sure not to overcook it. Its been a consistent issue of mine, especially at TGIFridays (Bayonne), which makes me iffy about ordering steaks at ""slow fast food"" places. Boyfriend had a smokehouse burger - included bacon, cheese, and friend onion rings - plus all other vegetable fixings. He was satisfied - very.  Here's the highlight of our lunch - It was BOOZY. We ordered margaritas - house ($3-ish) and flavored ($4.50) whaaaaat. Even better, they have these new tablet things for each table where you can reorder your drinks (or order a dessert). Needless to say, we left BUZZY. It was convenient.

Parking can be challenging since they share the lot with a bunch of other restaurants and the movie theater.  If you are lucky enough to get a spot on a busy day count your blessings.  I normally run in, get my name on the list to get the pager and then go looking for parking.  2 birds, 1 stone.

The bar area is nice and large with all seats having great viewing angles to watch your favorite games.  It also tends not to be very busy if there is a long wait.  So if you don't mind eating at the bar, which I never do this might be your best bet. Now to the food. Food here is your average selection of Mexican dishes, burgers and ribs,  Everything I order always comes out warm and tastes the same.  Nothing to write home about.  You can always do better if you go to an authentic Mexican joint, but this is Chili's! Beer is cold, good selection,  Bulldogs (Margarita with a Coronita upside down) always hits the spot, especially on hot days.  There is also a good choice of bottled beers.  Drafts are your normal selection of american favorites and my favorite Stella!

He didn't check on us during or after. But it was super nice of other waiters to keep asking us if we needed anything. That was really kind of them. Used the Ziosk to reorder our drinks and it came in no time. That was awesome. Their frozen margaritas are really good. They have raspberry, strawberry, and mango. The strawberry was out of this world. Best flavor in my opinion to choose. Well I didn't try the raspberry one but strawberry is a ten out of ten.  The southwest Mac and cheese and burger bites were fantastic. The Mac and cheese has chives and something with a spice in it that separated it from regular Mac and cheese. Also the cheese is so creamy and the noodles so soft. It's a great side dish. The burger bites happy hour item came with two mini burgers and fries. The burger meat was so fresh. It tasted like they grind the meat, mold the burger, then freshly grill it to order. It was super super good. It comes with bacon and cheese and a side of ranch which was the perfect condiment to put in the burger. Great night here watching the game.

That server, other servers,  the manager and bartender all took notice of us sitting there not being helped and did nothing.  Some passed us multiple times.  What got us was that the manager choose to stand around and chit chat with the servers rather then inquire about the guest that were sitting at a table for over 10 minutes without being greeted.  Finally we just got up and walked back to the door.  We passed both the server and manager who said nothing.  We mentioned to the host that we hadn't been waited on and he didn't seem to care.  At that point we had had enough and went to another restaurant in the complex.

The food was decent and around par with other American chain restaurants of this caliber (Applebee's, TGIF Fridays). Our complaint was the lackluster service we received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=60,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.088,2.24
22,Nate S.,"New York, NY",368,302,221.0,4.0,2015-10-24,"2.5 stars average..why?? Don't ask me the server's name but he was on point: he made good suggestions and he kept it real about what to avoid including drinks. We came in a group of 4 on a Saturday night at 1145, bar had a last call of 12. He recommended the Tito's punch which I was concerned was going to be too sweet and too fruity..but he kept recommending it, said we should get two each since it was last call.. and he was right..it was strong, refreshing and tasty..if you like rum punch with tequila you won't regret it. Food wise: we based our selections on his suggestions..which were all apps..the Buffalo wings (8 pieces), the guacamole and nachos (guacamole could've used more salt..too bland..saved by the salsa which was good), the chicken and something Flatbread (excellent), and then the egg rolls (beyond excellent). Bill with everything plus a lemonade was $82...didn't feel rushed to pay even though they wee clearly closing as evidenced by them dusting, turning off tvs, counting registers etc..we might as well have been part of the clean up crew. Not a Jersey resident so I probably won't be back..but definitely part of the better experiences I've had at a Chili's in a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.256,2.24

My boyfriend got buffalo wings as his appetizer and said they were amazing and cooked perfectly. I think the manager or assistant manager took our entree orders - my boyfriend got a smoked chicken burrito and I specifically asked if they did vegetarian enchiladas and she said yes so I went ahead and ordered an enchilada with black beans, onions, and peppers in it. My boyfriend said his burrito wasn't seasoned enough and was way too salty - it was mediocre. My enchiladas were dry and they were not stuffed with black beans like I had asked, but instead stuffed with broccoli (and onions and peppers) which I had not asked for. The enchilada was a little tough to eat because it was so dry... Isn't there supposed to be sauce smothered on the enchiladas?

I dislike the fact that I even have to give it 1 star. Horrible, horrible service. We live in NYC and I was craving that molten lava cake. I used to live in florida and they have a chill's in like every corner. But coming  back home, I couldn't find not one chilli's in the city. I googled it, the nearest one was this location. Which is about a 30 minute drive more or less, plus toll. My point is that it was so NOT worth the drive or the trouble because I didn't even get to have my freakin molten lava cake and I'll tell you why in a second. This was a couple weeks ago btw. Just hadn't had the time to sit down and write these paragraphs of how horrible the experience was, till now. Warning: This is a long review but worth the read.  Our waiter was so unprofessional, young kid and probably didn't know any better. He kept calling me sweetie after taking my orders for appetizer and entree... ""ok, and what would like to drink with that sweetie."" While my boyfriend was sitting there next to me. If it was the other way around and a female/waitress was calling my man sweetie, it would annoy me. It was just strange and as I said unprofessional. Like hello kid, you aren't with your friends hanging out somewhere. You don't know me on a personal level. I hate when people try and be extra friendly to get a better tip. Just do your job, get our orders right and attend to us in a timely manner and you will get a good tip. It's simple. There is a more professional way of doing things. This a business. Period. Moving along, I ordered the chicken alfredo or something with pasta and ok yes, it is a fast food restaurant but I really had no idea almost everything was microwaved. It tasted like a frozen tv dinner. I could have stayed at home and cooked a phonemail meal instead of eating this garbage. I didn't even take two forks at it and I was immediately looking for my waiter to tell him I didn't want it....he was nowhere to be found. I saw him 10 minutes later by the bar talking  and laughing it up with his coworkers, I kept putting my hand up and trying to make eye contact with him and nothing. Didn't even look our way. So I caught another waiter on his way back from serving a table near us and asked him to get the manager bc my food is horrible, I wanted to try and order something else and my waiter is nowhere to be found. (Wish I remembered his name.) Manager came over, I pointed him out and she apologized, admitted to the pasta being frozen and microwaved and said she is surprised we are compiling about one her best waiters. I said listen, the kid is charismatic but he's slacking. She comped my meal and asked if we wanted dessert on the house. I said ok yes...I'D LIKE A MOLTEN LAVA CAKE. (You know the one I had been craving and drove these miles to have after my meal) She said no problem we will get that for you in a sec. She apologizes again and walks away.... I guess she went back to tell the kid we had complained about him and how he didn't provide not even decent service. The kid walked over to us and said he was pulled aside by his manger. Is there anything else he can get us. My boyfriend told him straight up, no thank you, dude, you're a horrible waiter. I thought it was harsh but it really was horrible service. He was without a doubt offended, he apologized and walked away. ....guess who came to bring us our dessert.  The kid!!!....and he came to our table with the meanest face and his tone of voice sounded like he clearly had an attitude. I felt like I was back in high school. smh. My boyfriend and I looked at each other. The same thought crossed our mind.  WE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT EAT THE MOLTEN LAVA CAKE. The kid probably spit it in or something. We got up, left the cake on the table and left. I was so angry for like 2hrs over this freaking dessert.

Original Baby Back Ribs: STAY AWAY!  Dry with a tiny portion of meat and an overly tangy ketchup-like BBQ sauce.  Just awful. 2. Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger: Just ok.  The patty was small and on the dry side although the buttered bun was a nice touch. 3. Skillet Mashed Potatoes: Very meh and on the bland side. 4. Fries: Just ok.  Your standard fries. 5. Cajun Chicken Pasta: This was actually the best part of the meal.  They were able to add some broccoli and it was a very solid dish, overall, with chicken strips and a decently creamy sauce.  No, it's not the best pasta but compared to everything else, it was the winner. Price-wise, portions are small for what you pay and the overall bill including tap and tip came to about $45 for 3 entrees and a coffee (which you should NEVER get here - lesson learned).  definitely heading to Red Lobster next door or driving to a Ruby Tuesday.  At least their ribs are edible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus,1.88,2.22,2.22,1.608,2.084

67,Omar K.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,7,,1.0,2016-10-27,"I have just returned from the most horrible restaurant experience in my life. We walked in around 7PM tonight (3 adults, 3 kids). Waiter took our order and appetizers came out about 20 minutes later. No plates not enough straws. Never got plates until complained to waiter 3 times.  Kids, especially my 2 year old, were starving. 2 year old has food allergies so limited options. We had put in order for chicken nuggets at same time as appetizer order. After 800 hit my son was eating decorative lettuce off of appetizer plate he was so hungry, as main courses had not come out. We were assured by waiter chicken nuggets were coming out right away. 810 hits and no main courses. Called manager who insisted nuggets were coming out immediately.Made major fuss at which time manager says we dont have to pay for meal. This does not solve problem of my 2 year old still starving. They have no answers for food delays.  All the while we see 2 parties who came in well after us get food, eat, and leave. Perhaps this was a case of racism, not sure.  Unacceptable experience. Will never go to this Chili's again and suggest you do not either unless you want to traumatize yourself and your kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-secaucus?start=60,1.6,2.17,2.17,1.6360000000000001,1.942

I haven't been to Chili's in maybe 5 years, and oddly enough it was this exact location. But I had heard good things about the franchise as of late so we decided to stop by for a late dinner since we were at the expo center earlier. The pros and cons were on & off all night. The restaurant wasn't busy but we still got seated too close (chairs were literally back to back) to another table. The service was slow but when our server was around, we felt like we were getting good attention. But we never got refills and I suspect she left for the day near the end because someone else came to clear our plates and give us the check. No one ever came to take our payment (had to switch from card to cash & leaving). Extra 1/2 star for the manager trying to make things right with our meal. We ordered shrimp tacos but got chicken tacos instead for whatever reason. He was very apologetic & understanding, even took the value off the final bill. The food itself was good - actually a lot better than I remember! And our dessert (molten chocolate cake) was perfect... Moist cake with nicely melty insides. But like I said, service was almost non-existent and we waited for a good 5-6 minutes and couldn't even find someone to take our money. If you're not in a hurry, it may not be a problem for you.
