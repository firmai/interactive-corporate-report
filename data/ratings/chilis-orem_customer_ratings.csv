She got the sirloin which she really enjoyed and it came with a side of mashed potatoes which was surprisingly good. I got the crispy honey-chipotle chicken crispers which were way good!

It has all you need from Chili's at a great price for two. When picking the appetizer in the 2 for 20, always go for the chips and salsa, a smarter idea is get chips and guac (same price, get the whole chips&salsa + GUAC) and obviously go for the Honey Chipotle chicken crispers.

You get to choose two different entrees AND you get one appetizer. My wife and I got the Chicken Fajitas and the 6 oz. steak with broccoli and mash potatoes. With an appetizer and two meals our total was $21.57. And we left completely full. So Chili's is good bane for your buck. The Chicken Fajitas were pretty good. Some of the onions were a little overcooked, but what can you do. 2) The bottomless chips and are pretty good. Fresh baked chips, yum. Seriously, this was my favorite part of our meal. These chips are freshly baked, thin, and crispy. I liked how salty they were as well. Entrees: The food is good, but nothing to write home about.  Service: Our waitress was nice and attentive.

54,R R.,"Orem, UT",0,25,2.0,1.0,2015-06-11,"The service is hit or miss. And the server(s) will bypass a pair of patrons for a much larger group every time. Must be for the chance of a larger tip. Our server would almost throw stuff at us while en-route to the larger group of customers. The food served is absolutely inconsistant. It is not prepared the same every time we visit the same exact restaurant. I don't understand it. Very frustrating. It appears there is a general manager and a manager of the kitchen, and the kitchen manager seems to ""care less"" about what complaints come it about the food. Depending on the time and day of the week, they're going to do whatever they want and the general manager, server, and customers can kiss off. At least that's my impression after talking to the GM and server. This store must be a problem because there are a lot of bad reviews. I guess most of the good reviews haven't been to a Chili's for quite awhile. I came here years ago with my sister and her husband. My sister ordered a green salad. The salad had a dead black fly under one of the leaves. When we told the server, he told the manager, and he offered to not charge us for the salad. WHAT??? These people have not changed for 30 years, at least at this particular location. So if you come here it may be a good experience, but 3 out of 4 times be prepared for a disappointing one.

40,J C.,"McKinleyville, CA",1,12,2.0,1.0,2015-07-01,"Chili's food is mediocre, at best. The kitchen, at the Orem location, has a problem with speed and timing, when the restaurant gets busy - we have been served cold food... and also had only half of our table served while we waited for the kitchen to complete the remainder of our order. But... what really sets this chain restaurant apart from other local dining establishments is their incredibly HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! We had a party of 11, and they refused to try to accommodate a table of that size at 9:00 PM on a Tuesday evening. (There were plenty of open tables, but they insisted on splitting us.) The server was blunt about being annoyed by the fact that she got stuck with a table of ""kids."" (The table seated 2 adults, and four 15-16 year-olds.) I have been a server - in my experience, even teenagers are aware of how to tip... and, especially when they are accompanied by adults! It is completely inappropriate to vocalize that you are annoyed that you have to take care of your guests WHEN THAT IS YOUR JOB! The management was equally as rude when the issue was addressed. A gentleman approached our table, and... when he got defensive, he literally commented ""if you don't like my tone, you can just leave."" Well played, Manager-sir - we did leave, and will not be returning to Chili's in Orem. I recommend finding a different casual restaurant, in the area - DO NOT EAT AT CHILI'S!!

20,I. L.,"Lehi, UT",3,56,1.0,4.0,2015-10-19,"I have, in the past, frequently made the mistake of putting Chili's and Applebee's in the same category: all-around chain restaurants that serve the American spectrum from Tex-Mex to steak and fries. And while their menus and their atmospheres bear out the comparison, there are some definite differences between them, which my wife and I discovered after receiving a gift card to Chili's. See, I hadn't been to Chili's in many years (perhaps never) before a few weeks ago. But in the interest of using our gift card before we forgot about it, we ate there twice within the course of a month. Here's the biggest difference: the food at Applebee's is entirely what you'd expect. Some items are a disappointment, some are tasty, and all are slightly overpriced. The food at Chili's, on the other hand, is consistently above par and reasonably priced. I was impressed both times we ate there. On the first occasion, I got the bacon burger (because how can anyone ruin a bacon burger?). It came with an abundant helping of fries. It was miles ahead of fast food in every department: the bun was toasted, the bacon was thick, and the vegetables had a great presence. Even the pickles were a surprise: firm, garlic-toned and crunchy, with a balance of cucumber and vinegar that I've only ever tasted in one other restaurant (and in the occasional homemade pickle). It was totally delicious. I should warn you, though, that like most burgers this one isn't so great after a night in the fridge. This most recent time around I got the honey chipotle chicken crispers. Frankly, I wasn't expecting them to taste like real honey or chipotle peppers. I mean, when was the last time either of those flavors was fairly represented in a restaurant meal? I was shocked when the crispers tasted strongly of both. Apparently someone at Chili's got the memo: ""honey"" and ""chipotle"" aren't just buzzwords that sound good on a menu, they're actual ingredients. The crispers were plentiful and yummy and paired well with ranch dressing. Our only complaints had to do with the service. We ordered onion rings as an appetizer, and the waiter came back 10 minutes later to tell us they were out. I don't know how you run out of onion rings at 6 PM. I understand that forecasting demand is difficult, but at the very least we should have been informed of the situation before we ordered. Aside from that, there were three of us there and we all ordered items that qualified for the ""2 for $20"" deal. A skilled waiter would have billed the two most expensive items under the deal in order to give us the most favorable price on our check. Instead, our waiter billed the two cheapest items under the deal, leaving the third item at full price. I called her out on the mistake and, after some resistance, she fixed the check (saving us a little under $5). A small issue, but one that a more well-trained waitstaff could have avoided. Overall, I recommend coming here for the (excellent) food, and bringing a good attitude in case the service flounders, which it probably will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.9920000000000004,2.32

My wife said the guacamole that I make is better, but I think she was just trying to be nice.  As far as our entrees goes, I ordered the chili mango tilapia and my wife ordered the sirloin.  The mango chili sauce has a stronger kick than I was expecting my tongue was actually burning, and I LIKED IT!  Very well evenly seasoned. My wife's sirloin looked very much as excepted.

27,G T.,"Spanish Fork, UT",0,3,,2.0,2016-05-06,"Went there this evening and ordered the fajitas.  They came out and I was surprised to not see red bell pepper but figured it would be fine.   I took a bite and was disappointed that there was very little seasoning on the fajita mix.   The chicken was really bland.   We called over our waiter who recommended the fajitas to inquire if it was missing seasoning, he informed us it was not.   I told him it was very bland, he then told me he was not a fan of it either.   I then told him he probably shouldn't recommend it then.   Not sure I'll be going back after this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

Everyone has personality here, I love that. It doesn't feel so ""corporate"" when the staff is chill. The food was pretty good, if you love spicy, try their chipotle ribs! Appetizers were delicious and hot. Our food came out about 10 minutes later! Not bad for a table of 7!

I order the steak and chicken fajita, and the meat was disgusting. The steak was so burned it was black, it looked and tasted like the meat was old and had been pre-made and then microwaved after a couple hours of sitting there. The meat was so tough I couldn't even chew it. I would advise not getting anything that could be pre-made, only order something that they will have to make fresh for you like chicken tenders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Granted they were very busy and seemed to have an abundance of large parties and perhaps that contributed , however this is very disappointing. Not only did too of the seven orders not come out , but my ordered sides we're not available. The manager came out and offered me a replacement to which I agreed to a cup of corn which was then brought out ice cold. LOL. Hardly what I would call making amends. I would probably give this location another chance based upon the friendliness of the staff but I would definitely steer away if it was on a weekend night",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
8,Brett B.,"Provo, UT",0,4,,1.0,2017-04-25,"Had dinner tonight.  It might be a stretch to say that we saw our waiter twice.  On the menu in big bold letters it says CRISPY CHICKEN. It was soggy...and cold.  The mexican bowl was small and way over priced and the southwestern salad had twice the dressing it should've had.  Since we never saw our waiter we couldn't tell him. Finally, after waiting way too long we paid and left. Our waiter beat us out of the door as he must have gone home.  We won't have to worry about this again as we're done. Won't be back. It seems as though Chili's might have changed ownership because what was once a great place is now pretty average (as measured by our last 4 experiences).  Don't waste your time or your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

I went with the local Hefeweizen option they had also. My wife went with the Nacho's (the sauce with it was very good!) and she got the Margarita Grilled Chicken (I think) which the chicken was very tender! And for drink a Watermelon Margarita.

Somehow the bread sandwiches were soggy (3 sandwiches- all the same kind). Then, they made the burgers taste like fish and the ones that didn't taste like fish tasted like saw dust. After taking 3 bites 3 of us were forced to send the burgers back while not asking for another. Needless to say most of us went home hungry. Following, my ribs barely had any meat on them and zero flavor. The food was expensive, and gross if possible I'd give it zero stars- to anyone who is thinking of dining here run, run as fast as you can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orem,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
0,Peter K.,"Provo, UT",5,42,60.0,3.0,2017-07-21,"I'm giving this Chili's establishment three stars.  First off I ordered my food online through the chilis app. And I was told it would be half an hour wait. I didn't care because I knew it was busy especially being a weekend and late night. I ordered myself chicken strip with fries, and my sister got a vegan burger with a side of extra fries. The processes of ordering online was really easy and simple. You can even customize your order to how you want it!  When I got the text message that my food was ready. I made my way to chilis. I parked in the area where ""pick up only"". I made my way into the restaurant. I waited roughly 10 mins to be helped. You think if a worker saw you they would stop and ask if I've been helped? Nope that didn't happen. I had to ask and was told by the waiter he would come back with the person who was suppose to ring me up.  Finally after 20 mins of waiting they brought my food out and paid for it. When I got home and opened up the plates of food I ordered I was so shocked to find out that the extra side of fries that I ordered was so little. (Due to my sister eating the fries right away I couldn't take a picture.) But the amount of fries on the plate shouldn't be 5.00 extra!? It was my fault for not checking the plates of food.  Also another thing it's seems like all the co-workers didn't to care to work as a team, but rather state ""oh that's not my job!"" Their professionalism lacks big time.

I did this twice before giving up and downloading the mobile app.... which did the exact same thing to me. I finally decided to call in my order. It was ready on time, the girl who rung me up was friendly. But I get home and there is a plethora of problems with my order. My burgers have no mayonnaise (when I ordered and paid for extra). I ordered beef nachos (which were about 5 dollars more than regular bachos), NO BEEF. And I didn't get my side of pico with them either. The only part they got correct was my mashed potatoes. So I paid $9 for literally 6 chips with cheese which I could have just as easily done myself. Not to mention 40% of the cheese on them is burned to a crisp so it's going straight into the trash.
