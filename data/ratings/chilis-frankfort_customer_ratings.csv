11,Matry P.,"Frankfort, KY",0,134,130.0,2.0,2013-07-05,"Food tastes good, but the place is never clean.  Tables always have a layer of grease on them and the silverware is always full of greasy fingerprints. I paid a bill for three people and they automatically charged me a surcharge of 18% gratuity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
12,Barb B.,"Fairmont, WV",0,42,12.0,1.0,2013-08-01,"Have eaten at the chain before several times and this has to be the worst.  My child ordered the steak fajitas with just the meat, sour cream, and cheese......came out with lettuce mixed in the sour cream, but was at least medium.  She ate it, but was not happy.  I ordered the ribeye steak medium and it came out well done and tuff, which I sent back.  My family was almost done eating when it came out the second time -- rare.  I sent it back again.  Came back out with the unmistakeable look of being microwaved, swimming in liquid.  Still wasn't exactly correct but I figured they didn't know how to. The manager did take it off the bill. Also, my family was waiting for me to eat when the server came over with the check and asked if I would like a box for my dinner.  I was using the dish that my child's tortilla came in to lay the ear of corn and toast on and she took it to throw away.  I normally tip and tip well, at least 15 to 20 percent but she received nothing.  The food was not her fault but removing dishes and trying to rush me out was.  Also a pet peeve is iced tea is supposed to have ice, had to ask for an extra glass of ice twice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
10,Aly M.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,35,16.0,5.0,2015-04-11,"Came here tonight for a nice dinner. Place is well kept, clean bathrooms. Food was brought out fast. I LOVE their menu of soft drinks. They have a wide list from fanta, to root beer, to diet drinks ALL of which you can add flavors like vanilla, cherry, raspberry, etc. Ian was our server, I HIGHLY recommend him. He was extremely friendly and amazing and because of his extraordinary customer service we will DEFINITELY be returning!!! GREAT JOB CHILIS! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
8,Catie C.,"Lexington, KY",6,11,1.0,5.0,2016-03-29,"I had a really good experience at this place. My boyfriend and I stopped by for lunch, I got the quesadillas and southwestern chicken soup. For desert we got some blue and blackberry crumble bake and oh my God that was the best desert I've had in a long time! The service was great too, our waiter was really nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
9,Jane F.,"Frankfort, KY",4,72,3.0,1.0,2016-08-06,"Restaurants I'm Frankfort are pretty lackluster. And it seems they have cut quality and increased price. I mean you should be able to go anywhere and get chicken tenders and fries and be okay. But when you aren't sure if the chicken is for for human consumption, you have a problem. And I don't think you should ever have to ask for a refill at an eatery. It's a given. Empty glass? Fill it. Busy time? Server better not disappear for 15 minutes then come back smelling like the Marlboro man. Chilis is a no go unless you just want a Coke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
3,Elizabeth C.,"Waddy, KY",20,260,585.0,4.0,2017-03-08,"I was doing Whole 30 and needed an option on the go.  I read that Chili's was easily adaptable to the diet.  So, I ordered a steak without steak butter and no sides other than vegetables.  This turned out to be double broccoli... which wasn't terribly exciting considering all I could put on it was salt and pepper... So, maybe a little more creative variety for those of us not eating chips and dips and loaded baked potatoes... you know, all the things that make Chili's GOOD!  But, besides that tiny gripe, our server at the Frankfort location was super helpful and didn't hem or haw about us ordering funny stuff.  She was happy to accommodate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
5,Michael G.,"Louisville, KY",0,14,12.0,4.0,2017-03-22,Usually very good service and staff is very pleasant. We have our favorites on the menu as well as servers. We start every meal with the chips and salsa. I think their salsa is the best in town. You can't go wrong with a burger here or the ribs. I like the original sauce over the dry rub but that is a personal thing. Most times you get right in and food is served in a timely manner. Bathrooms could use some attention but that is most places around Frankfort.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
6,David B.,"Oak Creek, WI",29,154,5.0,1.0,2017-05-21,Let me see if I can say this clearly. This place is so dam nasty it stinks. The seats and tables has such a film on them that you stick to them. They have done such a bad job cleaning the floors you can hear your shoes sticking to it. Even the dam light fixtures are nasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
1,Tammy M.,"Lexington, KY",43,52,268.0,3.0,2017-05-24,I used to love Chilis years ago and seems they have done some serious changes to happy hour. With all the options they have on tap they only offer domestic light draft (2 beers) on happy hour. The majority of their taps are not light and/or craft. I guess I've become a little snobby on the beer side and find it not fair that a lot of establishments do not off anything other than domestic on happy hour. I understand they need to make $$$ but come on $6.85 for a blue moon is a little much compared to other places and it's not considered a craft beer.  Seems service has become a little more relaxed at this location also. This particular evening I ordered the quesadilla explosion salad without citrus balsamic and with the ancho ranch dressing on the side. We received our food and no dressing so I told our waitress. She bring us more drinks and asks how our food was. I explained that I still have no dressing for my salad. Now mind you this is a fairly large salad and when she comes back she brings the smallest cup imaginable with the dressing in it. I politely commented and said I'm going to need more dressing than that. I finally got the dressing desired and the salad was enjoyable as always.  We usually seem to find our way back regardless of what we've experience in the past just because they aren't terribly busy compared to other places.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
7,Mackenzie C.,"Frankfort, KY",0,2,,1.0,2017-08-11,"Brad is awful. If you have him as your waiter, request another or go somewhere else. For a Friday night, the restaurant was not even that busy and it has taken over an hour to get our food. We had two things of appetizers and about 5 drinks per person before we even received our food. Our waiter, Brad, made us all feel extremely uncomfortable and came about twice to actually check on us. I hate to not tip a waiter considering they basically live off tips but I just cannot tip after this poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
4,Rebecca J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,2.0,2.0,2017-08-17,"I can only speak to the food pickup portion of service, but it drastically needs to find some consistency.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
0,MaryLinda W.,"Frankfort, KY",0,33,23.0,4.0,2017-12-22,"We enjoy the food at Chili's and since Hubby received a Chili's gift card from his Secret Santa, he wanted to go there for a date night.  We split the Spicy Panko Onion Rings appetizer. They were crunchy and flavorful. Hubby had the Chicken Ranch Fajita Quesadilla and I had the Mango-Chile Chicken. We both enjoyed our meals and being out together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
2,Ashi B.,"Frankfort, KY",30,5,,4.0,2017-12-22,I love Chili's what can I say . mainly I love their fajitas but their chili cheese fries are good too especially with onions.. A lot of food for a reasonable price. Not fond of there chips and salsa,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frankfort,,,,,
