15,stacy g.,"Louisville, KY",11,25,9.0,2.0,2014-06-11,"Our experience started off really good. Our server was friendly and we got along well. I ordered a seven dollar lunch bowl off of the lunch menu. I had my menu open to the lunch portion when I ordered so I was surprised to see a $10 lunch bowl on my receipt. When I asked my server about it, he said he thought I was ordering from the dinner menu. I was there at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. Why would I be ordering off of the dinner menu? I was dining with my two small children and when we returned from the bathroom mid lunch, my daughters food had been taken away. When he finally came back to the table we told him that she was not finished with her but he came up with was ""I'm sorry ""and did not offer to replace her food and did not offer dessert instead. Pretty disappointing Chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
16,Shannon W.,"Jeffersontown, Louisville, KY",62,39,245.0,2.0,2014-06-14,"I have been to this location several times, because it's close to my work, and this was one of the few times they actually got my order correct but the Margarita Chicken only comes one way - chicken breast, rice and beans.  The food was good but the service at this location is always terrible.  It's usually 15 minutes before a server even shows up at the table & usually not to be seen again.  Several times I've had to ask another server for something.  I've ordered a drink before & 20 minutes later it was still sitting on the bar waiting for the MIA server to pick it up.  I've had a dinner comped before after we asked the manager, after an hour of waiting, why we hadn't received our food yet to find out the server forgot to put our order in.  On another visit my friend & I ordered dinners with two sides only to receive the normal sides that it comes with and four extra sides instead of them being substituted like we had asked and were charged for all of it. My friend was too polite to complain & just paid it.  So if you're craving Chili's and want accurate & fast service don't go to this location. The Chili's Hurstbourne Ln location is much better - good service & food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
11,The N.,"Louisville, KY",46,213,335.0,1.0,2014-09-20,"I live like 1.1 mile from here. Got bored of the same ole, so i stopped here. The bartender was rude. When i finished a drink, she said ""Be nice if you could hand me the glass."" What? When did i start working here? I'm a customer. Two servers talked to our bartenders about ""bad"" customers they had and gossiped about other co-workers. After eating an average meal, I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
17,Doug B.,"Louisville, KY",0,1,,5.0,2014-12-29,"Yesterday, happened  to be in the area and dropped in. The food was  good and the waitress  was excellent. The best service  we've had in some time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
10,Nadia N.,"Miramar, FL",151,95,315.0,2.0,2015-03-20,"Ummm... Let's just get down to it. The service at this location SUCKS! I will only give the review two stars because the food wasn't horrible. However, that's really not saying much and still won't propel me to return anytime soon.  My friend an I decided to visit this location for some lunch. We sat in the bar area and waited to be greeted by our server. In the span of time we waited a few tables close out and leave, while others come in and are seated. I'm thinking to myself... any day now! Finally, a nice young lady comes and greets the table. She's smiling and apologetic for the wait. We go ahead and tell her we are ready to put in our entire order. She takes the order and says she'll bring over some water immediately. Immediately must be code for 3 to 5 minutes. I'm beyond frustrated at this point. Eventually, she comes back over with the water and tells us our order is in and should be out shortly. In the meantime, we're chatting and trying not to watch the time. Our food finally comes out and looks great. Everything that was delivered to the table is as requested. Yet, in the 25 minutes we waited for a salad and entree... I never got my soup. Now, I should explain my friend ordered an entree sized salad and I ordered an appetizer as my entree. So neither order was difficult or required extended cooking time. And... the server still hasn't revisited the table - this is even after the order has come back. I have to flag down some other server to tell her my soup never arrived. The girl brings me the soup immediately. Then - like magic - here comes our server with another cup of soup. SERIOUSLY??? I mean thanks, I'll take them both home - but I really want yall to get it together! In the end, they took the soup off of my check. That's good and I'm appreciative that they tried to rectify the situation. But really, the experience was totally bad and that's not enough to make me ever go back. Luckily the food was edible and the place was clean - otherwise this review would be filled with expletives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
13,Robert C.,"Louisville, KY",3,15,1.0,3.0,2015-06-01,Food is good but service usually is not that great. Good place for lunch. Lots of choices and most are really good. Love the Cajun pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
14,Rebecca H.,"Louisville, KY",53,140,52.0,2.0,2015-06-12,"I give this location 2 stars -- not because the food or service was bad (it was actually good) but because both times I have been there recently, a family with a very loud baby/toddler was seated next to us and cried/screamed every 2 minutes and the parents did virtually nothing. Seriously ridiculous. We had to stop talking several times because we couldn't hear ourselves. I love kids. But if they aren't ready to be in a restaurant or you aren't going to manage them, I have no desire to be seated next to them. Ruined my whole experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
12,Vern N.,"Louisville, KY",1,39,4.0,3.0,2016-01-20,"Surprised at the negative reviews on here.  Let's face it, it's a chain and there's little freedom for place to be unique.  That being said, I think Chili's overall has a good menu and I've never ordered anything I didn't like.  Live and work nearby, so I'm at this location several times a year.  Always friendly/helpful.  Still, it's a chain... it's good, but nothing to write home about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
5,Larry E.,"Louisville, KY",20,122,106.0,3.0,2016-01-26,Ate here again last nite. Not crowded. Pleasant atmosphere. I ordered the Classic Cheeseburger with onion rings.  Tasty but not special. I split a piece of cheesecake with friend. Not really all that good. It was a satisfactory meal but I'm not in a hurry to return. I've adjusted my previous review of four stars down to three stars as it was such an 'average' dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
7,James M. G.,"Louisville, KY",100,6,7.0,2.0,2016-01-30,"While the entire building is empty, the inept hostess seats the bar are quadruple times. Doesn't help the bartender is being an ass to all of the female servers. He then gets sarcastic to a table inquiring on an item. They leave without eating. We ordered endless enchiladas, now I just wanna go home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
9,Mandy G.,"Louisville, KY",1,15,,1.0,2016-03-03,"Ordered carry out. 1/2 of the order was ready at pick up time, it sat while waiting 25 minutes for them to complete the order. Rude staff. Manager was nice when I called but person working carry out was very rude. Will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,

6,Rachael D.,"Louisville, KY",0,6,1.0,4.0,2016-06-15,"Highly recommend the Ranchero Chicken Tacos, super delish. The black beans that come with it are ok but I'm not a fan of the cilantro lime rice. Waitress was friendly, no complaints on the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
4,Tayiti C.,"Buford, GA",5,42,145.0,4.0,2016-12-05,"I really like Chilis' food, though I think it is a bit overpriced. I almost always order the delicious steamed broccoli as a side. Today, I had the broccoli with a veggie burger. Everything was tasty, the service was prompt during the 12:30-1:00 lunch period, and theserver was professional and pleasant. I also ordered the berry cake dessert (I don't recall the exact name), which was excellent. No complaints, other than the place being overpriced. $19 + gratuity for lunch for one (burger, side, dessert, juice).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
1,Shelley S.,"Louisville, KY",48,307,1623.0,3.0,2017-04-04,"Reluctantly I visited here with my hubby for his lunch break. I prefer new local businesses versus chains. But this was the only option besides fast food. The food was just ok. My kiddo ordered a kids pizza and fries. They do have multiple options for kid food choices. I love the play mate they give them. They can check what they want and side, it makes the kiddos feel grown up. The prices for kids meals seem higher than other chains. $5.50-5.80.  Includes entree, side dish, and drink. My hubby ate loaded boneless wings. Exactly what it sounds like boneless wings with cheese and bacon. It's enough to feed one person, no sides are needed. I ordered there bottomless salad and soup, which is a fantastic value at $6.99.  This is only available during lunch. I ordered the chicken soup and house salad. I was able to add avocado for a $1, more, worth it when you are looking for healthy fats and watching your choices.  Service was good, didn't remember servers name though. Loved that they have the number of calories listed on their new spring menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
3,Starkisha C.,"Louisville, KY",40,19,32.0,5.0,2017-05-17,"My absolute favorite place...this location exactly. I'm a REGULAR regular. I know just about all the staff. Becca and Marlon are my favs. The loaded potato soup is the best. I recommend the trio fajitas, the ribs and the quesadilla... I always sit at the bar. Great place to watch any sporting event.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
0,Michael S.,"Louisville, KY",90,57,6.0,4.0,2017-10-20,"Went here tonight for my father-in-laws Birthday.  They already had a table so there wasn't a wait.  Waitress brought me two Cokes to start with which I appreciated.  She was very kind, and did a great job, but didn't come back often to check on us. Started with chips and salsa which I think they have some of the best available anywhere in my opinion.  I ordered a half rack of dry rub ribs with fries.  My meal was good and what I expected.  Everyone with me enjoyed their entrees as well. The waitress did bring out a carmel cake/ice cream dessert since we had mentioned it was his birthday.  That was a nice gesture, and she brought 4 spoons for us to share it.   Wasn't ""spectacular,"" but it wasn't bad.  I enjoyed it, and would definitely return.  I do like the ambiance of the place in the evenings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
2,Robert J.,"Fairdale, KY",0,36,6.0,3.0,2017-12-13,"The food was good, the chips and salsa was good. We froze our ass off inside though, I think they forgot to pay the heating bill!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville-16,,,,,
