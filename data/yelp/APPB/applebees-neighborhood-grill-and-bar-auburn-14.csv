Ee Vonn Y.,"Oakland, CA",1166,1709,3217,3.0,5/9/2013,"If I had to go to a family chain restaurant for the rest of my life, I would go to Applebee's. Each restaurant has their own happy hour specials all are conveniently timed that actually aligns with most schedules. However, it does make me sad that they display their nutrition facts. Unless if you're eating broccoli for dinner or grilled seafood with no dressing, every entree runs into the thousands.  The 2 for $24 combo consisted of the spinach artichoke dip, ribs and fries, and the shrimp combo platter. My favorite item was the blackened shrimp over the almond rice pilaf with the herb & ale scampi sauce. It sounds fancy but essentially, it's seasoned shrimp mixed with limey goo over rice. The spinach and the pepper relish on the sides were a nice addition. Fries are always good here. The spinach artichoke dip was creamy but there is never enough to go around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Charles F.,"Opelika, AL",41,3,,1.0,1/5/2018,Got seated right away. That was the only bright spot. After 15 minutes of no waiter or waitress. I had to go find someone to get drinks we order right then too. More than thirty minutes after we still hadn't gotten food. It was a terrible experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Thelma L.,"Opelika, AL",5,4,,1.0,12/30/2017,omg. never never never would i eat at this location again. the salad i got literally had 6 bites of steak on it & was the size of a side salad. nothing like the picture on the menu. another member of our party got cajun chicken & shrimp. there was literally 5 tiny shrimp on the chicken. again nothing like menu picture. shrimp was barely cooked & i had finished my meal before the chicken and shrimp arrived at the table. i am still smh this morning in disbelief. i ate at this location 10 years ago & said i would not go back again. just didn't like the atmosphere. food was okay. everything was horrible this time. didn't complain. was afraid they would do something to the shrimp chicken dish. which hadnt arrived at table. it took probably 15min. to get to table. price was outrageous for portion size. only ate there because we had a gift card. thought i would give it one more try. gift card will be given away if i ever get another one. yes that bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Bea W.,"Columbus, GA",12,19,,3.0,6/3/2017,This place has very slow service. I can't comment on the food we have not got it yet and there is several empty tables.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
M G.,"Auburn, AL",8,39,132,1.0,5/4/2017,"Terrible, If I could give 0 stars I would!!! This place is a ripoff!  The food is mediocre at best, salty, soup tastes like came out of a can. Panera's across the street is way better and more flavorful for a lot less. Mall food would be a much better choice than this. Service was very slow and inefficient. Not that our waitress wasn't sweet but she kept forgetting things like utensils, pepper, my soup:/ For 4 people, 3 of us ordered soup and salad only and one had an entree, over $50. It's a shame that this place even stays n business. And what's with the electronic method of payment? I don't want to have to work to pay for my food. It was not user friendly, frustrating, impersonal...and by the way, you can buy games to play on it if you want to give them more of your hard earned money. I had to ask for an old school paper receipt because the pad froze up on me.  Now I know why I haven't been to an Applebee's in years, because it is terrible!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Antionette E.,"Auburn, AL",124,3,3,1.0,12/23/2016,"The food was horrible. I had to send it back twice. After the second time, I just said I don't want it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Soyoung L.,"Auburn, AL",4,1,4,1.0,8/28/2016,"My son has been begging to go this past week to Applebee's so wenfinally went. At first, it was just like any other restaurant. However, when we ordered we waited for more than an hour!! We asked about it and they said they wiuld bring out the manager. So we waited for another ten minutes, but still nothing!! We went to the kitchen ourselves and asked where he was. They insisted he was going to be out right away, but we ended up waiting another 15 minutes!! We ended not seeing him at all because we left. However, we expect an apology from then and especially Branden, the manager. Never goong ever again and would never recommend to anyone we know. What a waste of time!! If I could I wouldnt give them any stars!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Anna Lee H.,"Auburn, AL",0,3,,3.0,4/1/2017,Definitely a good place to get food if you would like to eat. The prices are reasonable and the service is decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Valerie S.,"Aston, PA",143,668,802,4.0,7/16/2013,This was a good Applebee's location... Great service and the food was just right.  Our waitress was really sweet too...  Would stop in more often but I live in PA and don't get down to Auburn much:(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Michael B.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,3/13/2015,Orders were wrong. Service slow. Food was slightly cold. But the order was discounted a few bucks because the waitress didn't know how to use the register. Overall an absurd experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Julia S.,"Talence, France",62,253,,2.0,12/7/2011,"Went here after taking an overwhelmingly long final exam. What I don't get is how this is 2011 and Applebee's still doesn't have a single vegetarian entree. Really guys? It's not that hard. Even chile's has a black bean burger or something. We came here at like 3 or 4 in the afternoon on a Saturday, and the place was definitely not busy. Which is why I don't understand why the service was so incredibly slow and terrible. Seriously. There wasn't a single server on the floor for like 15 minutes at one point. We had to search for someone for 5 minutes to ask for tortilla chips.  Since there were no vegetarian entrees, my friend and I split 3 appetizers - the mozzarella sticks, queso, and spinach dip. The mozzarella sticks were good. The spinach dip was scalding hot, but mediocre. The queso was lukewarm, so we had to send it back and ask them to reheat it. Talk about inconsistent. And considering all this stuff were things they had to have pre-prepared, I don't get why it wasn't all hot. I will say, the frou frou lemon drop martini that I ordered was good and strong, and the place was clean. But those are the only reasons why this place gets 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Ebony G.,"Auburn, AL",8,7,1,1.0,3/7/2013,"Horrible! I got take-out and ordered an oriental chicken salad and french onion soup. The salad was made with all iceberg lettuce. I've ordered this before elsewhere and it is usually made with salad greens. The portion size was less than a 2-year old would eat. The french onion soup was only about 1/4 cup soup with a huge mat of tasteless bread-like material on top of that, and thick, unedible cheese!  I ate what I could, but was still starving and had to go and buy myself another complete meal from elsewhere. I paid the price of a full meal for this crap and didn't notice the horrible quality until I got home. I live about 15 minutes away so didn't go back to complain, but vowed to never go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
Bev S.,"Opelika, AL",10,13,,2.0,7/30/2011,"It's a chain restaurant.  I know that.  Yet, I still had hopes of a good lunch.  First, though, I had to ask the waiter for a new knife since mine has something left on it from its pass (I hope) through the dishwasher.  He replaced it quickly, but didn't at all seemed surprised that I'd had that problem.  Hmmm. Ordered the Shrimp and Island Rice.  It came with three skewers of grilled shrimp over white rice plus 'seasonal vegetables.'  The shrimp was fine if a bit oversauced.  The vegetables were warm and *should* have been steamed.  Nope.  The carrots were so hard, I had to use a knife to cut them and the broccoli was crunchy.  Why do some restaurants have such a hard time with the concept of steaming vegetables?  Steamed veggies are soft and favorful, not hard and chewy,  The rice's claim to being citrus flavored was the inclusion of several pieces of mandarin orange.  Never found a bite of pineapple in it.   They did not have any Pinot Grigio, a light white wine, and instead brought me a glass of Pinot Noir, a dry red wine.  Didn't ask, just brought.  Hey, I guess Pinot is Pinot.  I drank it...not bad, just not what I ordered. Overall, unless you just want pub grub or a beer, I'd go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-auburn-14
