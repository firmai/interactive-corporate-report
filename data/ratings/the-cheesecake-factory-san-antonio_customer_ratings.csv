Rude staff, rude management, soup spilled down my back, my friends foot was cut by a plate shard which a server had dropped and dirty bar rag was provided to clean the bleeding wound... That kind of AWFUL. After a near 2 hour wait and the aforementioned disaster, the awful experience ended with a blah meal to top everything off. So even on top of my seething hatred for the company, the food was less than good.Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory since. Until now. Service was excellent. My guest nor I were never in any danger of being covered in our own entree or cut with dinnerware. PLUS. But what really won me over was the Baja Hash. It was off the charts good.

I called ahead before my last visit to make sure they still had peppermint bark cheesecake (it was the day after Christmas); the guy who answered must have been too lazy to walk and actually check... he told me yes.  I arrived a mere 10 minutes later (parking was crazy) and the waitress said they were out.  OMG!!!

Luckily they do have a gluten-free menu which is pretty solid. The kitchen needs to realize when they are making something gluten-free though and still make it gluten-free!! Duh!  For what it is, it's pretty great to be honest. Solid and friendly service. For a quick lunch while at the mall it's also really convenient (unless you have to wait an hour for a table).

71,Amy R.,"San Antonio, TX",369,585,55.0,4.0,2012-06-09,"I've always had fantastic service here at this Cheesecake Factory location (except for one time, but I've forgiven and forgotten)! Like I said, I've been here plenty of times and it can be expensive, but it's totally worth it. I have always gotten the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I never branch out, because the wraps are just amazingly delicious. There's nothing better in the world. Plus it never fails because everything is cold except the chicken and that's pretty hard to fail. I LOVE that when you go with a small child they bring out a child plate immediately when you sit which usually consists of apples, bananas and slices of bread. Keeps baby happy and keeps family happy because they don't have to deal with screaming, unhappy child. I LOVE the ambiance of this place. No matter where you sit, you don't feel like you're next to people, especially if you sit in the booths. If you sit at a table, you are close, but you don't have to - just request a booth. ;) It's really fancy and all the servers are dressed professionally and are usually really accommodating and friendly. I LOVE that there is valet parking outside of the mall. I hate shopping (check out my yelp posts, I really do hate shopping) so going to the mall for me is a freaking nightmare. I try to avoid at all costs. But sometimes you just HAVE to go, and if I ever go to Northstar Mall, I always treat myself to getting Cheesecake Factory so therefore I park in the valet (since it's free, you only have to tip the valet driver!) Bonus! Cheesecake is my favorite desert and I just love coming to the Cheesecake Factory. It is quite expensive for one slice but it's 100% worth it. I'd recommend to get the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake (mmmmmmmmm, I so want some right now). I just recently went back and had an excellent experience from our server, Esra G (what it says on our receipt). I even emailed Cheesecake Factory afterwards to compliment her and make sure she receives recognition for her outstanding service. You go to a top end restaurant and assume you'll be getting top end service, which is exactly what we received from her. Probably one of the best dining experiences we've ever had!! Would definitely recommend, if you haven't been, you must go and GET THE THAI LETTUCE WRAPS (yum).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=140,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.568,3.5200000000000005

96,Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370.0,4.0,2012-07-14,"Our waiter this evening was Cory. He provide my family and myself with very good service. The Cheese Cake Factory may be a ""chain"" restaurant but the provide a highly reliable place to always get a very good bit to eat. Today was no exception! My wife and daughter ordered the sweet tea, which is consistently good, not great, but good. I ordered a traditional on the rocks Margarita. The taste was solid, but the presentation and portion for $8.95 was lacking. It was served in a cocktail glass I'd expected to see a piña colada served in, not a margarita , plus they used regular table salt and not drink salts. I will say the reason they also did not earn a full 5 stars is I always find that unless you're at the bar. It takes long between drink orders. Now the food, I ordered the always delicious Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad! I was not disappointed again , the flavors and the freshness was outstanding! Their portions can be and are often big enough to share. Not this salad. My wife had th Renee special with chicken salad sandwich, clam chowder and side salad. This too was a great choice as well. The chowder had great taste and the chunks were not rubbery. The sandwich had a solid chicken salad mix in that was just right. The kids food was so good the parents had to sample the chicken fingers. By this point we got to full for their madden array of awesome desserts. When I'm back in this area, I will stop in again, but I'll go during non- peak hours , the waits can be long.

The horseradish sauce was flavorless. The cheese was not melted. The total sandwich was nothing short of horrible. They need to remove this item from the menu or learn how to make it correctly.

What I liked: the wife's Chicken Bellagio was delicious--the chicken was moist and tender, really good flavor. The accompanying pasta with pesto was a bit oily but overall it was a good dish.

I will write this review in bullet format... - Price.. $7.50 for a slice of cheese cake I feel is a little expensive. But to each his/her own. - The main issue I had at this location was the climate. It was 37°F is San Antonio this night and someone thought it was a good idea to continue to pump cold A/C into the restaurant. By my second bite into my hard pasta it was cold. It was so cold inside that we cut our dinner short and got our food to go.  As I am shivering trying to enjoy myself I look around and other people are still wearing their jackets bundled up. (i just wanted to make sure that I was not the only one) - The food.. My food was not hot to begin with and top that with the cold air and you might as well serve dinner topped with ice chips. My pasta was hard completely under cooked. If you are going to charge $20 for some noodles then it better be prodigious.  - Server.. Our server was good. I just don't think she knew how to handle my concerns. But that's what Yelp is for.

123,Joyce R.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,4,,1.0,2013-11-30,"This place is terrible. As a single adult when I eat out I tend to eat at the bar. I enjoy being able to watch football and have a meal. That being said, when a restaurant has a bar it should always be a kids free zone. If you have to be 21 to order a drink you should have to be 21 to sit there. I was watching college football drink in hand and ordered a salad to start when a couple came in with a child of about 4. This kid immediately starts pulling all of the beverage napkins out of the holder and strewing them all over the bar. Did I mention that the parents sat the kid in the stool directly beside me. They could have at least put their ill behaved child in between them.  The mother then pulls a sharpie out of her purse to let the kid color on the napkins and the bar. At this point the little paper napkins are all over the bar the floor and practically in my food. I'm sorry i don't want to eat in a trash pit so i finish my salad and pay my bill. Before heading to the door I ask the manager on duty why this small child is allowed to sit at the bar and allowed to interrupt my meal while the parent ignore the child. Don't you have a policy about small children and the bar. I was clearly told that since the state of Texas doesn't have a law that prohibits children at a bar they leave it to parents. Well Mr. Manager you and the parents of ill behaved children can have you bar because I won't be back. To other who are reading this, I am a mother of grown children, and a grandmother I would not let my children or grandchild sit at a bar until they are of legal age because it is simply inappropriate. The conversations at bars can be lewd and during sport event foul mouthed.

We waited about 10 mins to be seated and this was around 9:45pm. Our waiter was so nice she had a great personality and continuously checked up on us. We ordered a bottle of wine to start off our meal. When our waiter brought it out she let us try it first and then poured us full glasses. We ordered fried cheese for our appetizer, when they were brought out they were cold. Since that was the last batch of fried cheese out waiter compensated us with these delicious fried Mac n cheese balls.....AMAZING! I ordered the Spicy Jamaican chicken and shrimp. I couldn't be more impressed with a dish..it was perfect but the shrimp could've been cooked a little longer. I ended with a wild berry white chocolate cheesecake which satisfied my sweet craving! I loved this experience great for a date or just hanging with friends!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=160,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.188,3.76
24,Stephanie M.,"San Antonio, TX",157,179,37.0,4.0,2013-12-24,"I was a bit nervous when my boyfriend and his niece wanted to just drop in to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at the North Star Mall without a reservation... It was nearly 8pm on a Sunday, and I thought we would wait half a lifetime to be seated at a table.  Thankfully, we were seated immediately and the food came out relatively quickly... although all without the hostess giving eye-contact as to where we would be seated--- I realize all the info is on the screen, but I feel our presence wasn't really recognized; just an odd feeling when first walking into a restaurant. Get here EARLY if you have a large group... And you need at least half of your people present at the restaurant before they will seat you.  And even though you might get lucky, I would still put a reservation in before attempting to eat here. Food has always been melt-in-your-mouth good here.  We recently tried the grilled artichoke from the ""skinilicious menu"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it... I think the mustard/type sauce it was drizzled with was not necessary, as the garlic aioli was plenty flavorful for the artichoke. The niece ordered her favorite spaghetti with meat sauce--- has a good spice to it that she enjoys.  Boyfriend ordered the garilc pasta and he enjoyed it too.  I had the pasta carbonara with the chicken, and it was SO good!! Not your homemade carbonara, but a great carbonara-inspired dish. Also, your life will be so much happier and carefree if you just don't even look at how many calories their regular-menu items are.  Enjoy every bite!

46,Melissa D.,"San Antonio, TX",89,80,12.0,4.0,2013-12-31,Very consistent and aligned with the national brand. We eat at this national chain regularly when traveling with family as they have a very diverse and large menu which makes everyone happy plus a solid kids menu.  The service is good (although it can be on the slow side because the food is prepared fresh and it is a large facility) and it is a very clean location considering it is within the mall.  My only concern is that both of the last two times I have eaten in this location we have been spilled on. This last time a busser tried to carry way too much from a table and she dropped an entire pitcher of iced tea on the floor. The only table they seemed to be concerned about was the one directly next to the spill... we were within the splash zone and weren't even checked on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=160,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.12,3.76
50,Clarence J.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",60,1219,82.0,3.0,2014-01-25,"Yes, it's a chain, and one that covers a massively wide assortment of food, but the taste and atmosphere entertain me and I keep returning for more than just the amazing cheesecake.  I went to try the cheesecake long ago and have been going back regularly ever since to try more and more of the food.  I haven't gone wrong yet . . . and have occasionally even finished a whole plate. (Only when I'm sure I'll still have room for cheesecake, of course.)  I still find the better part of valor is to split the plate in half and plan to take the second half home for leftovers. (Or I guess you could share with whoever you're eating with and not have any left to enjoy later . . . but I'm not that nice.)  That said, there are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better, but I thoroughly enjoy The Cheesecake Factory as a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount (in a severe understatement) of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good. Don't go to the Cheesecake Factory for a nice quiet meal unless you hit the narrow window between lunch and dinner.  Otherwise it can be a study in controlled chaos, noisewise -- the most romantic meal will leave you hoarse from yelling to each other by the end of the night.  That said, as with all The Cheesecake Factories, the dark wood, black leather cushions, and deep red, orange, and brass (?) decoration -- as well as the myriad booths -- keeps the atmosphere warm and intimate despite the size of the restaurant. My only wish is that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best.  So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have become extinct, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=160,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.0520000000000005,3.6800000000000006

I ordered a burger off the ""skinny"" menu or whatever they called it. It was simple and good. My table mate got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. He said it was tasty.

Whelp, unfortunately there is only so much I can say about Cheesecake Factory. First off, there aren't any reservations...what the hell is up with that?! So decided to go with my girl for an early dinner, and it was a mistake. We planned and had hoped to be eating by 530 for a possible movie after. Nope nope nope! We didn't get seated until about 6 something. As we are waiting we notice the bar area/high tables are a free for all for whomever wants. Well we are waiting behind a couple who were there before we were and it wasn't a big deal. Well these snobby ass people come and just choose to stand by the bar and in between the tables...and then proceed to make people eating uncomfortable enough they leave quickly. They then continue to take seats at an uncleaned table and wait. I wish this was policed better because I was about to crack some heads and make a mess of the place at that point. We FINALLY get seated and open the menu to see that this restaraunt doesn't know what type of food it wants to serve. It had EVERYTHING. With the risk of not specializing in a special type of food the food then becomes just mediocre. Many restaraunts have an identity, its what they make and what they are good at. Cheesecake does not know what it wants to be. After choosing a pasta dish and getting through that the only thing that was worth saving this review was the cheesecake. What would one expect since the name of the restaraunt IS THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.

I've tried the Avocado Egg Rolls in the past and they are okay, but I think it's the potstickers that I really like. The cheesecake isn't bad, but once again there are too many choices.

173,Julie G.,"San Antonio, TX",370,322,1891.0,3.0,2014-03-30,"The Cheesecake Factory is a decent last resort for anyone looking to overpay and get sketchy service.  We come here every once in a while during lunch to share their fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and a Greek salad. I really like that their lunch specials carry on until 5:00pm. Of course, my favorite part about coming here is enjoying the warm sourdough bread before your meal. The fettuccine is consistently good and the sauce is not overpowering, try it. The sandwiches are decent, meatloaf is OK, chicken picatta is nothing to brag about and every time I've ordered the salmon I left with a tummy ache. When I do decide on splurging, I'll go with the fresh banana cream cheesecake...YUMMY!  The staff are not personable and they definitely don't care for people who share plates, my goodness the portions are HUGE. Almost every time we've come here they've treated us differently when we say we're sharing and the table next to us gets smiles and constant drink refills.  Parking is chaotic in the mall area and valet is even riskier. Make sure to save your receipts after your meal to show the valet guys for your free parking. The last time I visited they were doing construction on their valet parking area and my parking anxiety was in high gear because people were honking and waiting in long lines to get their car parked.

200,Ollie T.,"Harvest, AL",0,23,8.0,1.0,2015-06-18,"Abysmal! I rarely eat at The Cheesecake Factory mainly because there's never been a location within 100 miles of where I've lived.  I remember going twice in the past while traveling, but not within the past few years, so we (my husband and I) decided to give this place a try while in San Antonio.  We were at the LaCantera mall the previous day and decided to eat at P.F. Chang's instead of The Cheesecake Factory there.  This was probably a mistake, as I didn't enjoy our dining experience at the San Pedro North Star Mall location! We arrived around 7:30 on a Wednesday evening (last night).  We gave our name to the attendant and asked for a booth, and she told us there would be a fifteen or so minute wait.  Fine.  Twenty minutes later, our thingy buzzed, and a different woman showed us to our table--which was dirty.  The table itself hadn't been wiped down, and there was food on the seats.  We pointed this out to the hostess, and she just looked at us.  We stood there, the three of us, rather awkwardly, and she finally wiped at the table and seat.  But it was still dirty.  She asked, ""Are you going to sit there?"" My husband flagged down a busboy, and he wiped the table and seat off with the same rag he'd been wiping everything else down with.  The seat was left wet, so I wiped it off with a napkin. At this point my husband called for the manager and asked him why we would be seated at a dirty table.  Also, when the busboy wiped the table down, the silverware and napkins had to be removed (yes, they'd set a DIRTY TABLE), and when the bread was brought out by our waiter after we finally sat down, we didn't have anything to use to butter it!  The waiter didn't even seem to notice that he'd brought us bread, butter, and we had no utensils. After bringing us bread the waiter took our drinks order and brought me the wrong thing.  I asked for Dr. Pepper and I received a Diet Something.  He said he would try the other side of the bar, and took my drink away.  He didn't bring it back--roughly twenty minutes had passed--during which we ordered our meals--before I got the chance to ask him what happened to my drink.  He disappeared and brought it back to me a couple minutes later.  Really, should I have had to ask for him to bring my drink back? Shortly before our food arrived he did replace our silverware, but we had to ask him to.   I ordered the Romano Chicken and my husband ordered the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combo.  They cooked his steak wrong.  He asked for well-done as always because neither of us enjoy raw/undercooked meat, and half of it was pink inside.  He said it tasted ""oily"" and lacked flavor.  My Romano Chicken was tasteless and super unimpressive.  The noodles were way too greasy!  My husband once again complained to the manager about the poor service and food, from the silverware situation, to my drink situation, to the steak being undercooked.  The manager, a Hispanic fellow, basically acted like he didn't care, but he did comp us on desert (which ended up being unimpressive as well--I've had better tasting cheesecake from the frozen dessert section of the supermarket). It will be a long time before we go to another Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=100,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.9800000000000004,3.3600000000000003

Definitely, the definition of home cooked meals and comfort food without the extreme calories.  The lettuce wraps are a bit messy, but I like how they use the butter lettuce. It gives a softer flavor and wraps better. It's also a great portion size.  We also ordered a slice of cheesecake, which is definitely a must-do when going to The Factory.

35,Stephanie A.,"San Antonio, TX",91,103,316.0,2.0,2015-08-27,"I cringe when I a friend or family member decides to have their special occasion at this establishment. Not because the service is bad, or the restaurant is dirty, but because this establishment is sincerely overrated. Here's why: - 99.9% of the regular menu has at least 1,000 calories or more, per dish (even a waiter confirmed this).  (They recently implemented a skinny menu, which had 600 or less calories per dish. *sigh of relief*).  -The cheesecake packs a strong rush of sugar that made my hands swell and pulsate (is that normal?). Once again, add another 800 to 1,000 worth of calories to your dinner... you may be close to ingesting 3,000 calories with an appetizer, meal, alcoholic beverage, and dessert if you wish. I have had better tasting cheesecake elsewhere, it is not all that great....seriously. -The dishes are very much overpriced for the quality and taste that is served. $12 for a small Happy Meal sized Turkey Burger and side salad. I honestly have had better tasting food elsewhere. I don't mind paying a shiny penny here and there, but I expect quality and good taste.  -The parking is horrible at North Star Mall to begin with, and the parking lot in front of the restaurant is always packed. May be due to half of the parking being occupied by Valet.  -There's normally a wait to be seated. This place does tend to get packed during lunch and dinner.  Now let me just say, the interior has a very palatial and relaxed ambiance. Dim lighting and relaxing chairs. Felt very cozy.

The place isn't dirty...I've had the privilege of going to 4 different establishments in different parts of the country and first hats off is to the consitency, despite a very large menu.  For those seeking less calories, go with the skinny menu, don't eat the bread or stay home.  Everytime the service has been prompt, friendly, AND despite being as busy as it always is I get what I need in a timely manner.  Everytime they quoted a time to be able to sit and wait for a table they have had us seated sooner than expected.   If you are in a rush, try dining during the week.  I also recommend figuring out what you are craving prior to looking at the menu, chicken, salad, pasta, seafood, theres quite a remarkable selection.  I have had the Mahi Salad, coffee (superb), Asian salad, vegetable salad (organic) , burgers, steaks, spaghetti, meatballs, and a different cheesecake every time.  The wine selection is as good as anywhere as well.   Overall a definite 5 stars.  Cheesecakes are delish, with a cup of fresh coffee hard to match. Price/value - quality and quantity coupled with quick and professional service.  Negative reviewers must've had a bad day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=60,3.4,3.59,3.59,3.4120000000000004,3.5140000000000002

Everyone ordered their favorite dish. Not one repeat. All different. Our waitress was great in the beginning. Food came out great and we even got our picture taken of the whole family. Everything went great. My girlfriend sat next to my mom. And they barely knew each other. The only reason I took a star away was the ending. I bought a cheesecake for him with happy birthday on it. But it took longer to get than our food. And when I wanted to pay for everyone. She took so long that my brother came up to see what was going on. After I had told her early about it.

It was a Saturday night so the wait was super long and we had been waiting longer than the wait time we were told. Eventually we were told that we could sit outside so we agreed. We were a party of about 13 people.  When the host took us to the outside seating, he said we couldn't put the tables together because they'd break. Which meant we would all have to sit at separate tables and that completely defeated the point of a group birthday dinner. The birthday girl was very upset because she had made it clear that we were all supposed to sit together.  So off to a bad start and we were ready to leave...  But when our server Ivan came out, he saved the whole night. He allowed us to move the tables together and made sure we all had a good night. He was great, helpful, fast and overall a great server.  Eventually the manager came out and told us that the birthday girl's dinner was gonna be on the house.

Not sure why the size doesn't seem larger and there are no new ingredients listed in the dish) It's spicy, saucy and has caramelized chicken with asparagus, peas and red peppers. Anyway this instance they didn't make the chicken right it came out soggy and you could tell it was not caramelized. For a $17 dish that chicken needs to be made right. Cheesecake Factory has good service they always aim to please and made it right for us, but by the time the fixed portion came out we were full from the avocado egg-roll appetizer and little we ate out of the original plate..

We got there, got seated and then sat waiting for 10 minutes. It was busy, but not that busy. Then the waitress took our drink order and disappeared for another 10-15 minutes. This was at 3pm in the afternoon, fully staffed, busy, but not extremely so. We had 2 hungry preschoolers and no one even brought them bread. We got up and started to leave when the waitress intercepted us and started being really pushy about us sitting back down. She kept saying, but I have your drinks! I told her we'd had enough and started to leave again. The hostess then asked if I wanted to speak to a manager. At this point I was so angry that I said yes. The manager came out and begged us to stay, insisting that he would make sure that we were taken care of and promising my daughter that he would make her birthday special. We sat back down and were promptly served by a very nice waitress. She was the best part of a bad experience. We got our drinks and then ordered. The manager came back over and was extremely pushy about us ordering an appetizer that we did not want and didn't even get until after our food arrived. The food was ok. The salads were inedibly drenched in dressing. The kids didn't even want to eat anymore because everything had taken so long. And NO ONE came and sang Happy Birthday or brought my daughter the promised dessert or anything. DO NOT LIE TO MY CHILD ON HER BIRTHDAY!!!!

Food was okay nothing to rave about! I do not think I would go back to that particular restaurant! Too chain like and not enough attention to quality of food and service!

Are all Cheesecake Factories like this? I do not eat a Cheesecake Factory often but recall they had good burgers, salads and of course ... desserts.  Service from the hostess station through checkout was exemplary. I recommend asking for Taylor to serve you. She was pleasant and helped my wife narrow down what she should try for lunch. Our food came out timely and well served.  It is unfortunately the food that was disappointing here. We started with our traditional calamari appetizer. That was served with tarter and cocktail sauce. I quickly asked for a side of marinara sauce. I never liked cocktail sauce. The calamari was obviously fried in old oil and maybe pulled out of the deep fry early. So it was mushy and had a multiplicity of flavors, none of them becoming.    Sandwiches were not better. My crispy shrimp sandwich was served on an obviously burnt and scraped bun. Oh well, I try not to eat bread any way. It wasn't long before I discovered why the calamari tasted off. Certainly they fry the shrimp and maybe chicken in the same oil. And the adjective ""crispy"" is an unfortunate miss.  My wife's steak sandwich was also sad.  Well we ordered side salads anyway and both started in on those. Hey, this is just lettuce with one tomato wedge!   Without protein in our system we both chose to skip dessert.

We only saw her twice after receiving our food from somebody else, and that was when she wordlessly plopped down a newly filled cup of coffee and continued on then returned later to see if we were ready for the check. The coffee was on point and the mugs are fairly large. My fiance ordered the Crab hash, and while he enjoyed the hollandaise sauce, eggs, & potatoes, there was hardly any crab on the plate at all. I figure if a plate's name features a particular ingredient/food it should have a good amount of it. Other than that disappointment, what WAS on the plate was good. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and a side of scrambled eggs. LOVED the pancakes! Not an overwhelming lemon flavor, but the touch of powdered sugar with the strawberries all made it a bite from heaven! My eggs on the other hand were bleh. I don't like when people's version of scrambled eggs is more like a smaller burnt omelette. It seemed like somebody let the eggs cook too long and failed to keep stirring it in the pan.

I was disappointed in the chicken nuggets because they were incredibly salty and I couldn't finish them. The cheesecake was delicious! I think I would have enjoyed my experience more if the calorie count wasn't next to every menu item. I mean, seriously, why would I buy more if that's on the menu?!!

148,Virginia A.,"Houston, TX",264,9,,2.0,2017-03-14,"Please save your money and skip this establishment. Overpriced. Overrated. And under appreciative of their guests.  Visit started with arriving around 8:30pm and told a 30 minute wait. Our buzzer went off roughly around 30 minutes later, great. Hostess took our pager and told us to step to the right and wait - no specific area - just wait to the right... where everyone waiting for a table is standing. We proceeded to wait for another 15 minutes with still nothing, confused if we had been overlooked since we were just standing in the middle of a crowd. The whole time I am making eye contact with the hostess and nothing. I had to approach the hostess to figure out what was happening. 5 more minutes pass and then she gives us some story about some other person had claimed our table because they are calling out names (then why the pagers???) and we would be taken to a booth. Arrive to our table and it's a small 2 top. Okay....  needless to say, the rest of the experience went downhill. Our waiter, despite being very nice (1 star) was more concerned with the larger tables around us than us. Appetizer was very good (egg roll sampler - responsible for other 1 stars). Our entrees finally came out after a long time and were barely warm at best. Neither my boyfriend and I were impressed (he got one of the combo steak and chicken plates and I got the herb salmon plate - do not recommend either). Refills took forever and despite our entrees, we were going to order a cheesecake because, surely, they couldn't mess that up. But of course, our waiter disappeared for 20 minutes caring for the table of 3 who was drinking next to us and never stopped by in the 3 times he came to their table while we had gathered plates and napkins on the table. We decided once he had come to us to not get dessert as we lost the desire to spend more money.  If you are going to spend good amount of money to eat here - they need to work on their customer experience. I will not be back and I'll be sure to let friends and family know to save the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=60,2.88,3.31,3.31,2.536,3.138

160,Jay R.,"Cypress, TX",0,13,,1.0,2017-04-04,"Terrible experience at dinner on a Monday night, we arrived at 630 pm to a mostly empty restaurant. We were seated at one of the small tables that have the shared bench and the hostess pulled one of the small tables over to make room for 4. I noticed immediately that there was a significant amount of food debris that was uncovered French fries, green beans, some large brown smashed bits what appeared to be the remains of some long gone chicken fried steak. The mess appeared to be several days old and not just left over from that day's lunch. The hostess didn't seem to recognize it or was not bothered by it and I was willing to overlook it thinking they would simply clean it up before our drinks arrived. Sadly the food and mess sat on the floor, to watch the entire ordeal we went through that night. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and my coworker, a fried catfish plate. The food arrived quickly and looked pleasing. However I checked my fish and found it to be roughly 10% cooked and very raw. I asked our waiter to have the kitchen manager come to the table so I could educate him on the quality of food leaving his kitchen and I showed him the undercooked fish and he apologized and said he would send the server back to take my order for a replacement. Fast forward 15 minutes, or server never returned, we sat there empty drinks on the table my coworker finished his meal and finally flagged down our server who appeared to only have 1 other table. It was at this point asked to speak to the restaurant manager. He was apologetic but seemed to be very uncaring about the problems with his slow inattentive wait staff, unclean floor in the dining area and poor quality of food coming out of the kitchen.  The catfish dinner was comped and we walked out to never return. If you go for dessert you might be safe but they are not cleaning the dining area I'm almost afraid of what the kitchen looks like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=60,2.68,3.32,3.32,2.468,3.0640000000000005

The egg roll sampler comes with avocado egg rolls, southwestern egg rolls, cuban ones and salmon ones. I substituted the salmon ones for more cuban ones and they tasted like tuna fish. They were also cold, greasy and the acocado was brown. Plus they forgot one of the sauces.  My stuffed chicken was just a casserole. It said on the menu ""stuffed corn tortillas"" with chicken. These were just laid in there with a bunch of stuff on top and was cold as well.  I spoke to the manager and he didn't offer my money back nor to come pick up fresher food.

Every anniversary, birthday or celebration my family, friends and I come here. I have never had a bad experience... Before today. And honestly let me say that even today, the food was delicious. Our server Brittany was friendly and the environment clean. Cheesecake has always been consistent... Not today. We placed our order, started munchin on the bread & a few minutes later our server informs us my entree wasn't available (tuna titaki salad). After that, the substitute entire i wanted wasn't available in lunch portion. OK, I can't fault them for that part but it just added to my annoyance at that point. Nevertheless, it's my friends birthday, the show must go on. Our food comes, I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp (excellent by the way!! I must give kudos where it's due) Afterwards we order dessert. You guessed it, the cheesecake i ordered is not available.  One thing after another. Now don't get me wrong, no one died today and the quality of the food served was great. Here's the kicker, (the reason for the 1 star) At this point the manager has been informed of the numerous inconveniences. I never asked to see the manager, but our server told them what all happened. I would think there would've been a discount or a comp on my bill, (keep in mind it is a birthday as well) but no. $80 tab comes I pay it AND STILL TIPPED my server 20% with a smile on my face. because I'm a good sport & it's not her fault. I didn't ask to see the manager because Im not lookin for a free meal. But I AM EXPECTING customer service. There are too many other restaurants in town and there's nothing magical in your food you don't make a steak any different than anyone else. What has set you apart is your attention to quality & of course desserts. But i'd happier spend my next $100 where my patronage is appreciated and it's valuable to you. I shouldn't have to suggest to you how to makeup for difficulties during my dining experience. So I'm not going to tell you how to manage your establishment. If you're a manager, you should know. And THAT is my complaint. NOT that you were out of ingredients or discontinued options... It's that you were aware of the multiple dissatisfactions & didn't take the time to even come by our table and extend an apology let alone comp a drink. Nothing. Bad show Cheesecake.

What a huge disappointment when compared to my last visit years ago....the menu has changed and not for the better; our food all came out at different times, leaving the birthday boy sitting for about 5-10 minutes while all the rest of the table had their meals; the food itself was ""meh"" at best. I had crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp; I've definitely had better-tasting dishes from a frozen box. Not only that, I nearly choked on what I thought was a piece of pineapple, but turned out to be a pineapple-chunk-sized piece of ginger. Ouch. My son's kid-sized pizza and our buffalo strips also looked and tasted like they came from a freezer. I have no problem paying for good food, but this wasn't. The 2 stars are for the drinks (Long Island actually had some kick to it and milkshakes were huge and tasty) and service.

We were entertained by the beautiful photos of various menu items displayed on two large TV screens just above the Cheesecake counter. This was actually extremely helpful because seeing all their sensational dishes displayed so prominently helped us decide what to order before we were even seated.  We also noticed the plethora (love having the opportunity to use that word) of Gluten Free menu options available on both their traditional menu, Skinnylicous menu, and the KIDS menu. Hoooooray!!! They went far beyond chicken tenders, hot dogs or mac and cheese too which impressed me.  We ordered the Grilled Salmon for our GF toddler, which included carrots and their famous mashed potatoes. It was a tough choice for our son who wanted to order everything on his little menu. They accidentally prepared the Grilled Chicken but we opted to keep it, and it was thoroughly enjoyed by one very hungry 4yr old. We added a side of Gluten Free French Fried that were also great to have as an option.   My Husband ordered his usual Chicken Madeira dish which is highly popular and for good reason.  I had my heart set on the ""steak cauliflower"" which was a vegetarian option and mostly because I was curious to see what a steak of cauliflower looked like. Unfortunately they had sold out of this dish...wow it must be good...so we asked Kery to recommend an alternative. He suggested the Eggplant Parmesan and shared that he is not a fan of eggplants but this was an amazingly delicious meal he often enjoyed.  SOLD! He was one hundred percent correct. The huge portion served eggplant cut into small discs and included a generous portion of their angel hair Pesto pasta. Delicious! Not too salty or greasy or crunchy.  We truly enjoyed our meals and had plenty to take home. I look forward to trying the cauliflower steak next time but am glad that though it was in absentia, I was able to try another entre I probably would not have chosen otherwise. We also plan to get the GF grilled Salmon for our son next time.  L.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio,3.08,3.26,3.26,2.8000000000000003,3.1880000000000006

My wife ordered the chicken Romano and it came out so soggy that we had to send it back.  We all finished our meal by the time the correct order came out.  Not even a sorry or any apologies from management.  Who's running things here.  Here's a pick of our McNuggets slider. When I asked the mgr that I had to go track down cause he passed us 5 or 6 times without acknowledging us he told me that he's only taking care of one order.  I'm not here to try and get free food.  I'm just letting you know that I paid for something that wasn't up to par.  Sad Second picture was pulled off the web,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-antonio?start=20,2.92,3.22,3.22,2.436,3.1000000000000005

I'm not sure how this business keeps its doors open.  But I will be calling Corporate about both the manager's blasé attitude, and, the waitress lack of training.
