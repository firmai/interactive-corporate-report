Olivia P.,"Raleigh, NC",16,128,284,5.0,12/28/2016,"If you have children and you are looking for a place with a spacious dining room where everyone can find something they want to eat, look no further. They have plenty of huge tables to seat big groups and the location is super convenient because it's at Triangle Town Center Mall. We have a positive experience every time we come here and this time was no different. We came in hungry and left happy :-) Service- A+ I think our server's name was WILL. He was exceptional. He talked to the kids and joked with them, kept drinks refilled but never rushed us. Absolutely perfect service.  Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza-A perfectly crisp crust loaded with spicy, tangy, bacon-y, yummy goodness! Chicken Tortilla Soup-A not traditional tortilla soup but still hearty and satisfying Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings-A served steaming hot, great flavor California Club Pizza-A fresh ingredients, great presentation Pepperoni Pizza-A classic yummy pizza loaded with pepperoni Red Velvet Cake- A kids loved this cake Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake-A kids loved this chocolatey dessert also",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh
Paul E.,"Raleigh, NC",40,101,227,5.0,1/8/2017,Snow day and they are open for a 2pm late lunch. Ordered the  chicken lettuce wrap which was good the lettuce was crunchy and fresh. Chicken BBQ pizza too saucy for my taste added bacon everything is good with bacon and Garlic Cream Fettuccini which was good al dente. Butter cake is a must try comes with ice cream. Service is very good and had that extra good charming character. Plus no waiting time for table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh
Laura G.,"Raleigh, NC",196,498,528,4.0,9/29/2015,"Comfortable sunny restaurant with lots of windows giving it an open air and very pleasant environment. Great waitress, was attentive but not annoying. Appetizer of dumplings was a beautiful presentation and tasted so good. Friend had breakfast type pizza with eggs on top and she loved it. I had the Thai pizza which was better than I remembered. Only taking away one star because it turned into a $46 lunch for two, which is higher than I like to pay for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh
Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",799,1040,4156,2.0,2/23/2014,"Husband (Trent R) just reviewed our most recent experience here, so I won't rehash the less than stellar experience, but  feel I should update my review, since the last one I have here is a 4-star.   We have been to this restaurant many times over the years.  So many times that I'm surprised that I've never taken pics before.I even didn't take a pic of our salad this time thinking I had done so many times.  Our standby meal has always been to share the half roasted veggie salad, along with a nice thin Sicilian.  We've also enjoyed pasta dishes and other pizzas.  We even made it through a period of time where they (misguidedly) removed our fave salad from the menu, but (thankfully!) brought it back.    Through all the ups and downs, the one thing that had always remained consistent was the quality of ingredients.  Something has changed where pizza ingredients are concerned.  Neither of us is quite sure what it is.  I'm suspicious of the cheese...a different kind?  Different brand?  Meat not quite the same quality level?     Also, despite being told by a very friendly manager that they were unprepared for Champs having suddenly shut down so they were busier than usual (uh, it's a Saturday night at the mall, and EARLY 6-ish at that and they weren't any busier than we've seen them before...certainly not full) ...wouldn't you regardless have someone who knows how to make mixed drinks?  And how in the world could you be out of tequila, when the specialty drink on the card on the table is for a (great-sounding) tequila drink?  There is literally a liquor store right next to this mall.   All we know is something is very different here than it used to be.   TIP however:  Sign up for their pizza dough program.  Thanks to that, we did get a free small plate (we chose the sausage flatbread which was pretty good), and also got $10 off a $40 order.  That and the manager taking off Husband's bad drink helped to take the sting off the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh
Bailey W.,"Clayton, NC",0,2,5,1.0,7/17/2017,"First, let me just say that I have eaten at a few different CPK locations many of times, so I knew what to expect when I chose to eat lunch here on Saturday. The food was edible at best. I ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos and a passion fruit mango iced tea. Please tell me why there was something wrong with everything I ordered. The iced tea was basically water. There was barely any taste to it, definitely not passion fruit or mango flavored, let alone black tea flavored. The fish tacos were burnt, you could taste it in every bite and it was really overwhelming. Then on top of that, the chips I was served on the side of the tacos were stale. I'm not talking ""hmm try these chips I can't tell if they're stale or not."" I'm talking, one bite and you have to spit it out because it's so bad. It's obviously been stale for a while, and I guess nobody decided to check them ever. & not trying to nit pick, but the bread they serve you was kind of hard and not warm at all. My husband kept telling me to send my food back, it was so bad. But I have this fear of doing so and it coming back with spit or what not in it. So no, thank you.  Now that we're done discussing the food. The majority of the wait staff seemed fine from what I could see and hear, but our waiter in particular was really ticking me off. First, he served me my iced tea and decided to randomly just snap his fingers right in my face... I guess he thought it was cute.... okay. Then the entire meal I could hear him basically indirectly begging for a good tip to every table he waited on. Every time he went to check on a table before giving them their bill, he would try to pressure them into getting a dessert, and whenever they said no thank you he was all ""you sure? I'm sure you have more room! Dang!"" And sure enough he did the same to us, and was like ""well I had to try."" I get it, you live off of your tips. & we were going to give you a great one regardless (& we still did) but something just rubs me the wrong way when during my entire meal I can hear you trying to push people to get desserts just so you can get a bigger tip.  That was my pretty terrible experience at this location. Won't be eating here again, I can say that. Not worth the price for bad food and awkward service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh
Dee H.,"Burlington, NC",46,9,16,3.0,1/1/2017,"Tried this yesterday and it was pretty good. I like my steaks well done but it was more charred on the outside than what I prefer, so there was some pink on the inside. The waiter said it was because the steak was cut thicker than the usual. The potatoes were really good. The asparagus could've used more flavor but I was substituting it for the arugula salad. I thought it was neat to serve the entire on a cutting board. By the way, the mojitos aren't bad either ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh
Madelyn A.,"Raleigh, NC",73,110,361,1.0,2/20/2016,"I wish there was a way to give your food 5 stars and the service you received a zero. I ordered the roasted garlic pizza which was yummy. This has to be the worst service I ever got by a waitress. I waited and watched my waitress service both her tables twice before she finallllly took my drink order. I proceeded to place my order (Coke Zero and Roasted Garlic Pizza) pretty simple right?  She brings my Coke Zero which is totally flat. I wait to get her attention again and she tells me to ""hold on"" when she finally comes over, I let her know that my soda is flat and she tells me the person at other table told her the same thing. I will get you a new one. My second drink must of came from same fountain, it was also flat. I just asked her to bring me a sweet tea. My food arrives by another server and I don't even have a silverware set. Once again, I try to grab her attention to let her know and she says I will be right with you. Not to mention another waiter saw my tea low and refilled without me asking (Thank you) Not one time in between she came over to check if I needed anything. She would of clearly seen I didn't have any tableware. I scarfed down my food so I can get out of there. I ask for my check and she didn't even asked if she could do anything else. Her other tables of 3 were obviously more important than my table of 1. She doesn't ever have to worry about me eating there again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh
Aaron B.,"Raleigh, NC",171,130,58,5.0,10/29/2014,"I came in last night for my birthday dinner.  Of course I came rushing in the door 20 mins to closing.  Usually you can expect some glares from staff at other places..... not today.  Warm greetings and assurances that all was good. Andy was my server and I must insist you ask for him.  This guy is probably one of the very few servers I've ever had do table service that truly enjoys his job.  Sense of humor, engages in conversation and even makes what order seem to be the best item offered on the menu.   One of my friends called in to let the staff know I was there and asked them to acknowledge me in some way.  So Andy and another gentleman took it upon themselves to clap and sing Happy Birthday to me.  Why is this unique?  Because nothing could be more awkward than two men singing to another man in a public space.  But they did it.  Willingly and even in good humor.  That alone is worth mentioning.

Stacey R.,"Raleigh, NC",156,35,,2.0,1/1/2016,"Lackluster food, flavorless, bland, and hastily prepared. California pizza kitchen as a whole used to use better ingredients and seemed to have more enthusiasm with the preparation of their food.  This particular location is probably the worst I've been to.

Danielle M.,"Queens, NY",279,265,583,4.0,12/11/2015,Believe it or not this was my first trip to a California Pizza Kitchen lol I know they are all over the place but I never actually went inside and had food from one. My friends and I were debating on where to go to eat before flying out of NC and we picked here. Good spot! Friendly service too. So I ordered the Sicilian thin crust pizza and split it with one of my friends. I would have liked a little personal pie but they only had like 4 or 5 to choose from and none of them sounded like something I wanted to experiment with at this time lol We also ordered a round of bloody Mary's before we ate and ehhh I'd pass on that if I had to do it again. It tasted like thick tomato sauce and nothing more. Wasn't a fan- but the presentation was nice haha The pizza was excellent!! Actually thinking about it right now is making me want it again lol But yea- if you're ever in an area where a California pizza kitchen is- I'd definitely stop in and grab some pizza! I know some places are different than others but this particular location is A-OK with me! :-),https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh

Cat L.,"Apex, NC",55,102,373,3.0,5/1/2015,"My family & I had dinner here one day this week when we didn't want to cook but still desired something hearty, ""healthy"", & delicious.  We started the meal with a couple of the small plates- Bianca white truffle & Gorgonzola flatbread and a bowl of crispy fried mac&cheese balls.  We ordered a couple of pizzas for the table which catered to everyone's diverse tongue.  While we waited for pizzas we ordered steamed wontons which were flavorful & a delightful twist before pizza.  The pizzas we ordered were Wild Mushroom, Jamaican jerk chicken, & the pear/Gorgonzola pizza. The wild mushroom was very bland. The jerk chicken arrived to the table with bacon morsels which we sent back after requesting a second order. The pear/Gorgonzola pizza was sloppy with the pears & spinach not evenly or nearly dispersed on the pizza making it hard to enjoy.  The flavors are there for some items but the unfinished presentation & the flamboyant wait service is not something I'd look forward to again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh

Maybe it's just part of Southern Hospitality, but every time I'm here, I've been greeted by smiling, friendly waiters/waitresses. The food here is also pretty good. You can't go wrong with any of their salads (grilled chicken chimicurri salad is my fav), and their low calorie (under 650) menu is actually tasty.  They also have some great appetizers. The white corn avocado dip with chips and avocado club egg rolls are delicious (and slightly healthy!).

I told my wife just have them take it back. She said she will eat it, while doing so she found some hard things she could not chew.

Trent R.,"Raleigh, NC",5,21,1,2.0,2/22/2014,"On occasion, I find myself in a parallel universe, where the laws of gastronomic delight that I've grown accustomed to are turned upside down.  Sadly, my most recent trip down the rabbit hole was at a restaurant I've always enjoyed in the past. Yes, Friends, California Pizza Kitchen has let me down.   I could almost excuse the spotty service (it was Saturday night and they were busy).  I can hardly complain about a raspberry basil martini (minus the basil) that showed up 20 minutes after I ordered it, even though it was nothing but raspberry puree with ice (no, I don't believe there was any alcohol in it), because the manager did comp it.  And I can ignore not being offered bread, grated parm and crushed red pepper, even though all the tables around us had them all within seconds of ordering.  Oh, and it's certainly an honest mistake to refill my unsweet tea with sweet tea... even as the server is confirming that I do, indeed, want unsweet tea. I could ignore it all, if only the pizza was still as tasty as it once was.  Sadly, it's not. We got the Sicilian, which, if you've not experienced it, is a thin crust carnivore's delight... or it should be.  This pizza, while overflowing with ingredients, just didn't taste as good as it once did.  What went wrong?  All we could conclude is that maybe the ingredients are not up the quality they once were.   Extra cardboard is still cardboard. On the plus side, the grilled veggie salad we shared was as good as it's always been, and the new flatbread app we tried was tasty.   You know, I might even excuse the pizza... but then our server started pushing dessert and a box when it was obvious we were far from finishing our meal. As I said, a parallel universe California Pizza Kitchen... same space, a lesser experience.  I think our pizza craving will be pointed elsewhere for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh
Michael B.,"Raleigh, NC",109,429,947,4.0,8/16/2014,"This pizza chain most definitely has a very unique menu. So if you are looking for just plain cheese or pepperoni, save some money and head to Papa Johns.  The first thing that you have to do before you head over there is download the California Pizza Kitchen ""Pizza Dough"" app. With that you will get points and free food. Who doesn't like free?  Then check in with your Yelp app once you get there. I am a Yelper first and foremost of course.   Tonight I went there because they sent me a free dessert over there Pizza Dough app. I was just going in and out to pick up their Strawberry Shortcake Dessert. Everybody was uber friendly. I sat at the bar while they prepared the dessert to go. Andy and Kristen were a pleasure to chat with as I passed the time waiting.  The staff is very friendly, and the food is great. I have been a few times before and had different dishes. It is worth trying. At this location you will get great food with great service.

I waited an additional 30 minutes for my food. So my lunch was wasted because I had to wait. The second time I had an issue was I ordered a half salad to go. It was $10 and when I got back to work I swear there was barely any salad in the box. I got ripped off! The portions for take out aren't the same as eating in the restaurant.

Darcy D.,"Raleigh, NC",70,36,,2.0,6/13/2009,"Had I reviewed this place based on my previous experiences I would have given it 3 stars, but today's visit knocked it down to 2 and I don't think we'll ever go back.  I've been to this CPK location several times in the past and the service has been mediocre at best. I understand that it takes a little time to cook each pizza and it would be ok if that was the only thing that took a bit. However, on previous visits we've also had to wait extraordinary lengths of time just to get salads or drink refills. My boyfriend's parents like it so we end up there fairly often even with these faults. I've been willing to look over it because the pizza is actually close to amazing and they carry some local beers on tap (the only reason it still gets 2 stars, really).  Anyway, on to today's visit. My boyfriend and I decided to stop in as we had some shopping to do at the mall and didn't want the food court. It was right at 12:30pm, but much to my surprise the place was a little less than 1/2 full. Upon entering, we were seated promptly at a booth.  And there we sat. For 10 minutes. No one got our drink orders or even stopped to say ""Hi, I'm SoAndSo, I'll be your server and I'll be right back with you in just a second"", nothing.  This wouldn't have been so bad had 1) the place not been 1/2 empty as I said before, and 2) I had not seen what the servers were doing other than taking our orders. From my seat I had a clear view of the server station and in those 10 minutes I saw the following: 2 servers who stood there talking the entire time and 3 others who stopped by the station at least once each to chat for a few minutes. Not a single one of them even touched the station so I know they weren't entering orders for other patrons.  5 servers just standing around - 2 of which actually walked by our table on their way to the station, too - and no one even said hello to us.  This is where we got fed up and decided to leave. On the way out we passed by the hostess station and a hostess (not the one that sat us) cheerily said ""Bye! Thanks for coming!"" to us. At this point, I had to say something so I politely told her that we had been seated for 10 minutes and no one had been by our table so we were leaving and she could mark our table as ""open"".  She blinked at me for a second and just said, ""Oh, I'm sorry!"" but didn't say anything else - no offer to try to get the manager, try to fix it or anything like that.

They have a pretty good variety of dishes: Salads, really good appetizers, pizza (of course), sandwiches, pastas and entree dishes. The last time I went, the kitchen left something off my pizza (which totally wasn't a big deal to me) but the manager and server apologized, took the pizza off the bill as well as made me a new one to go home with.

Bailey W.,"Clayton, United States",0,2,5,1.0,17/7/2017,"First, let me just say that I have eaten at a few different CPK locations many of times, so I knew what to expect when I chose to eat lunch here on Saturday. The food was edible at best. I ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos and a passion fruit mango iced tea. Please tell me why there was something wrong with everything I ordered. The iced tea was basically water. There was barely any taste to it, definitely not passion fruit or mango flavored, let alone black tea flavored. The fish tacos were burnt, you could taste it in every bite and it was really overwhelming. Then on top of that, the chips I was served on the side of the tacos were stale. I'm not talking ""hmm try these chips I can't tell if they're stale or not."" I'm talking, one bite and you have to spit it out because it's so bad. It's obviously been stale for a while, and I guess nobody decided to check them ever. & not trying to nit pick, but the bread they serve you was kind of hard and not warm at all. My husband kept telling me to send my food back, it was so bad. But I have this fear of doing so and it coming back with spit or what not in it. So no, thank you.  Now that we're done discussing the food. The majority of the wait staff seemed fine from what I could see and hear, but our waiter in particular was really ticking me off. First, he served me my iced tea and decided to randomly just snap his fingers right in my face... I guess he thought it was cute.... okay. Then the entire meal I could hear him basically indirectly begging for a good tip to every table he waited on. Every time he went to check on a table before giving them their bill, he would try to pressure them into getting a dessert, and whenever they said no thank you he was all ""you sure? I'm sure you have more room! Dang!"" And sure enough he did the same to us, and was like ""well I had to try."" I get it, you live off of your tips. & we were going to give you a great one regardless (& we still did) but something just rubs me the wrong way when during my entire meal I can hear you trying to push people to get desserts just so you can get a bigger tip.  That was my pretty terrible experience at this location. Won't be eating here again, I can say that.

Yes, Friends, California Pizza Kitchen has let me down.   I could almost excuse the spotty service (it was Saturday night and they were busy).  I can hardly complain about a raspberry basil martini (minus the basil) that showed up 20 minutes after I ordered it, even though it was nothing but raspberry puree with ice (no, I don't believe there was any alcohol in it), because the manager did comp it.  And I can ignore not being offered bread, grated parm and crushed red pepper, even though all the tables around us had them all within seconds of ordering.  Oh, and it's certainly an honest mistake to refill my unsweet tea with sweet tea... even as the server is confirming that I do, indeed, want unsweet tea. I could ignore it all, if only the pizza was still as tasty as it once was.  Sadly, it's not. We got the Sicilian, which, if you've not experienced it, is a thin crust carnivore's delight... or it should be.  This pizza, while overflowing with ingredients, just didn't taste as good as it once did.  What went wrong?  All we could conclude is that maybe the ingredients are not up the quality they once were.   Extra cardboard is still cardboard. On the plus side, the grilled veggie salad we shared was as good as it's always been, and the new flatbread app we tried was tasty.   You know, I might even excuse the pizza... but then our server started pushing dessert and a box when it was obvious we were far from finishing our meal.

This first time, I ordered to go. I only had an hour lunch and they said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I got there after 25 minutes and it wasn't ready. I waited an additional 30 minutes for my food. So my lunch was wasted because I had to wait. The second time I had an issue was I ordered a half salad to go. It was $10 and when I got back to work I swear there was barely any salad in the box. I got ripped off! The portions for take out aren't the same as eating in the restaurant. Lastly, I took my sister to lunch and they put us at a dirty table. It had crumbs and drink rings on the table. Step up your game!!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh?start=20
Catherine R.,"New York, United States",330,325,300,3.0,13/3/2009,"Thai Crunch Salad- yummy yummy yummy. Ingredients include edemame, grilled chicken, peanuts, crunchies, and it comes with lime/cilantro dressing as well as thick peanut sauce. Share that with someone, and also split the Wild Mushroom pizza. If you'd rather have sauce than pesto as the base, do that. you'll be happy about it. This was a dulish dinner. Also, if you go to this location, and you like a cheerful server who's really eager-to-please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, ask for Carol. Carol will take care of you.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh?start=20
Darcy D.,"Raleigh, United States",70,36,,2.0,13/6/2009,"Had I reviewed this place based on my previous experiences I would have given it 3 stars, but today's visit knocked it down to 2 and I don't think we'll ever go back.  I've been to this CPK location several times in the past and the service has been mediocre at best. I understand that it takes a little time to cook each pizza and it would be ok if that was the only thing that took a bit. However, on previous visits we've also had to wait extraordinary lengths of time just to get salads or drink refills. My boyfriend's parents like it so we end up there fairly often even with these faults. I've been willing to look over it because the pizza is actually close to amazing and they carry some local beers on tap (the only reason it still gets 2 stars, really).  Anyway, on to today's visit. My boyfriend and I decided to stop in as we had some shopping to do at the mall and didn't want the food court. It was right at 12:30pm, but much to my surprise the place was a little less than 1/2 full. Upon entering, we were seated promptly at a booth.  And there we sat. For 10 minutes. No one got our drink orders or even stopped to say ""Hi, I'm SoAndSo, I'll be your server and I'll be right back with you in just a second"", nothing.  This wouldn't have been so bad had 1) the place not been 1/2 empty as I said before, and 2) I had not seen what the servers were doing other than taking our orders. From my seat I had a clear view of the server station and in those 10 minutes I saw the following: 2 servers who stood there talking the entire time and 3 others who stopped by the station at least once each to chat for a few minutes. Not a single one of them even touched the station so I know they weren't entering orders for other patrons.  5 servers just standing around - 2 of which actually walked by our table on their way to the station, too - and no one even said hello to us.  This is where we got fed up and decided to leave. On the way out we passed by the hostess station and a hostess (not the one that sat us) cheerily said ""Bye! Thanks for coming!"" to us. At this point, I had to say something so I politely told her that we had been seated for 10 minutes and no one had been by our table so we were leaving and she could mark our table as ""open"".  She blinked at me for a second and just said, ""Oh, I'm sorry!"" but didn't say anything else - no offer to try to get the manager, try to fix it or anything like that. I wouldn't have taken any offer they made, but it might have made me more willing to come back at some point.  So in summary: Pretty good pizza, some local beers on tap, but probably some of the worst service I've ever experienced.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh?start=20
Ian W.,"Durham, United States",51,58,49,4.0,1/9/2010,"I've been on a quest for a decent Hawaiian pizza.  I have tried several in several different locations up and down the East coast.  CPK's wasn't all I was hoping for.  Usually, I love their pizzas and salads.  All are great, and satisfy when I'm in the mood for a decent lunch.  Unfortunately, the pineapple was dry, the Canadian bacon was cut into strips when it should have been left alone, and the sauce is almost not there.  Skip it, but try their other pizzas.  It's a must.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh?start=20
Kim B.,"Knightdale, United States",7,43,2,2.0,24/3/2011,"I always came to CPK to get the warm vegetable salad and I would add the Rosemary chicken and it was amazing.  I like to eat heathy and this is one of my favorites, even though this salad is almost $20.   But when I feel like splurging and I'm craving this salad I don't mind.  That's the ONLY reason I go.  Unfortunately I went in there this week and they no longer serve it.  We were told they eliminated about 13 things off the menu and this salad was one of those items even though people requested a lot.   Well I don't eat Pizza so I ordered a different salad but that was my last visit.  Oh, we did order the white bean hummus and it was great, but you get a whole lot of pita and a smidgen of hummus for $7.00.  For some squashed up beans? I don't think so.  I think the food is amazing at CPK but  the prices are extraordinarily high and ridiculous! So it's off my radar.  bye, bye!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh?start=20
Jerry B.,"Raleigh, United States",44,50,332,4.0,24/6/2011,"How can you go wrong with Pizza? Well...sometimes it just Pizza and not a WOW experience, but that's not always a bad thing. 3/5 for food and 4/5 for service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh?start=20
Chris E.,"Raleigh, United States",0,104,5,1.0,20/11/2011,I've been here many times in the past. This time I ordered Tequila Lime Paste and added chicken. It came with three very small pieces of chicken for $3 extra! Ridiculous. Same for my guest who ordered Kong Pao Pasta with chicken added. Same with desert. If we wanted like the picture shows it was $1.50 extra! I hate these catch and switch sales tricks. Do not underestimate the customers intelligence.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh?start=20
Emily W.,"Raleigh, United States",2,22,,4.0,8/2/2008,"Very good gourmet pizza. I've been here quite a few times and don't recall every being disappointed. The look is pretty typical chain restaurant - but in this case, I wouldn't say thats a bad thing. They have a pretty good variety of dishes: Salads, really good appetizers, pizza (of course), sandwiches, pastas and entree dishes. The last time I went, the kitchen left something off my pizza (which totally wasn't a big deal to me) but the manager and server apologized, took the pizza off the bill as well as made me a new one to go home with. They were both extremely nice and very accommodating. Service absolutely gets an A+. Menu gets an A. Atmosphere gets a P for pass. Seating seems fairly limited so move your arse!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-raleigh?start=20
