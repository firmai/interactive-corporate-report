Andrew R.,"Camp Hill, PA",37,123,44,4.0,12/18/2014,"Look, this isn't a high class chain or anything so it can't get five stars. But the service was great, the food was good, and they were kid friendly. Can't beat it for the family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Chloe A.,"Harrisburg, PA",9,58,,1.0,9/16/2014,Awful awful service. We were here this past Sunday for lunch and sat in the bar area. Our waiter was terrible. It took him 10 minutes to come over and ask what we wanted to drink. Then when we wanted to order our food we had to ask 2 different people to go get our waiter because he was nowhere to be found. Not once did he ask if we needed anything which we did so the manager had to come over to us. We just moved to the area and have been to this Chilis a few times and it was fine. This last experience was awful. Don't think we will be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Sara B.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",0,25,,4.0,1/8/2016,"We live very close to Chili's and probably eat here about every month or so.  Food is average, but we've always had good service.  Good beer selections.  Always have a Troegs seasonal on tap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Andi M.,"York, PA",2,65,1,2.0,2/27/2011,"Service here sucked!  I went with a couple friends and we waited a half hour for our appetizers!  We managed to finish them before getting our meals because it took an additional half hour for our meals!  Getting refills on drinks were nearly impossible because the server never came back.  When we finally did get refills, the server spilled my entire glass of iced tea...on me!  I must say, this was my first, and last experience at Chili's.   The only reason they get two stars from me is because they ended up taking my entire meal off the check for spilling the iced tea all over me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Chris L.,"Carlisle, PA",0,4,,2.0,2/19/2013,Waited an hour and a half for our entree's but never got them. Asked for the manager and she never came out. Would not recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
C D.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",1,40,,4.0,9/1/2014,Decent service. Food was fine. 4 stars based on being a chili's since it met my expectation. Even has a menu fit for a picky person like me that is not a big fan of Mexican.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Gene S.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,10,1,3.0,10/13/2014,"For whatever reason, this place seems to be a magnet for local families with children.  Not the restaurants fault, and it's nice that they have carved this niche for themselves.  That's great if you want to dine in romper room, not so great if you're looking for an adult dinner outing.  Other than the atmosphere, the food is consistently good.  Head to the Chili's in Carlisle if you don't mind the extra drive time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Scott S.,"New Cumberland, PA",0,5,,5.0,6/3/2014,"Great food and even better service! Management is always friendly.. If you want a nice meal on the west shore, you should definitely stop by this Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Joshua N.,"Highland Park, NJ",143,334,15,3.0,4/18/2011,"Good burgers! Gotta love the chips and salsa too. And if you can, get the southwest egg rolls and an appetizer, they are wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
CC C.,"Fairfax, VA",0,34,,1.0,8/27/2014,"My boyfriend and I attempted to eat here this past Saturday night (8/23) and the service was beyond awful. If I could give zero stars, I would. We arrived at prime dinner time (around 730pm) and there was NO hosts at the front desk. The desk was empty and multiple people were standing around in the front of the restaurant waiting to put their name on the wait list. About ten minutes went by and finally the hosts returned to the front desk and put our names on the wait list. The wait was 25 minutes so we decided to get a drink at the bar while we waiting. The bartender greeted us and served us almost immediately. About ten minutes went by and our buzzer went off (much to our surprise). We tried to close our tab at the bar but the bartenders completely ignored us. They were at the other end of the bar doing who knows what. Since I didn't want to lose our table, I left my boyfriend at the bar to close our tab and followed the host to our table. Five minutes went by and my boyfriend still hadn't been able to get the bartenders attention so I waited at the table alone. During this five minutes, multiple waiters walked by my table and attended to the other tables around me, but not one acknowledged me or offered me a drink, etc. My boyfriend joined me at the table and at this point, it had been ten minutes and we still did not have a waiter come to our table and greet us. We decided we'd wait another five and then leave. We weren't going to give our money to a restaurant where the service was this bad. During our last five minutes of waiting, I made eye contact with MULTIPLE waiters and NOT ONE came up to our table or even realized we had not been greeted or helped. At this point, I had been at the table for a total of 15 minutes and was never greeted or offered a drink. I came to the conclusion that because the place was so busy, the waiters were probably waiting on more tables then normal and none of them wanted to pick up our table. It's such a shame because we love Chili's food. However, we will NOT be coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Amy G.,"Hampden, PA",122,387,25,4.0,11/27/2017,"Of what I consider to be mid-tier chain restaurants, this is my favorite. Yes, there's occasionally bad service, but the food at this Chili's tends to be good for something that needs to be mass-engineered to assure consistency across all locations. The Tex-Mexish menu offers a lot of options. The Loaded White Queso is probably completely unhealthy, but it tastes good and is hearty enough to make it a meal.  My family also likes the flatbreads. They also make a great meal option if you want something lighter.  I have to be honest, the wings don't thrill me. I do, however, like the Chicken Enchilada Soup. My son is a fan of the burgers and the requisite fries.  My son also likes the ribs but I don't think they're a good deal.  I really like the Mango-chile Chicken entree. I avoided fajitas at Chili's for a very long time because I thought they'd be pretty blah. I broke down the last time we were there and split the 3 meat combo (about $18 for chicken, beef, and shrimp) with my daughter. I was completely impressed with the flavor.  Here's how Chili's describes them: ""Sizzling to the table with garlic butter, cilantro, bell peppers & onions. Served with Mexican rice, black beans, guacamole, sour cream, pico, salsa, shredded cheese, flour or all-natural corn tortillas."" I also like the occasional two-for-$XX meal deals. My husband and I can eat there (drinks excluded) for under $25.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
Mary M.,"Harrisburg, PA",100,108,228,4.0,11/22/2017,"Stopped in on a Friday evening and I figured it would be busy. There was 4 people standing in front of me waiting for their table. They told me for a party of 3 it would be about 10 mins. Okay, no big deal. We did wait almost 20 mins..still no big deal. They don't seem to have their pagers anymore and they asked for my cell number for them to contact me. Not sure I'm a huge fan of that idea.  When we finally got seated, we saw there was about 5 empty tables. Not sure why they weren't seating people there. Our waiter Bryan was really nice and fast. I ordered for my 1 year old before we ordered our meals since he was hitting his hangry phase.  The kids option was okay. I wished fruit was like a dessert instead of a side. The paper mats were a little more grown up for a little kid so he was bored with that quickly.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. This was good! I would get this again. It had a good heat and a little bit of sweetness. The waffles were a little hard on the outside but I did enjoy it.  I got the Strawberry Lemonade to drink. It was a little too sour for my taste. I think 1 cup was plenty. Probably note to self, get the ice tea or just water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
Brian K.,"Dillsburg, PA",0,2,,3.0,8/14/2017,"A good chain restaurant. We had prompt service and good hot food for a very reasonable price. We made a point, my sister and I, of dining here to show our appreciation and support for a restaurant chain that publicly congratulated two female customers on their engagement and even offered to send an engagement present. Given the political temper these days, it is refreshing and delightful for a major chain to support all people equally. In acknowledgement we are also showing our support, with our wallet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
Kimberly L.,"Camp Hill, PA",0,1,,1.0,1/5/2018,"We just walked in the door from eating out at our local Mechanicsburg, PA Chili's. I immediately downloaded the Yelp app so I could post how disappointed I was with our slow service. It took over 35 minutes to get our cheeseburger, quesadillas, fajitas & bowl of soup. Not a large order. The place was not overly busy for a Friday night. We won't be returning. There are lots of other options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
Neil T.,"Lewisberry, PA",0,22,,1.0,10/30/2017,"After a bad experience over a year ago, we decided to give them another try. Sunday (10/29/17) around 3 PM. Went in no host/hostess in sight so we sat ourselves at the bar. 10 minutes and no bartender in sight. So... we went back to the front to discover the couple who came in ahead of us still had not seen a server or host/hostess. We left. This is the exact reason we walked out over a year ago. I will never set foot in this Chili's and you can take that to the bank. I cannot imagine how this location stays in business. We went down the road to Friday's and it was packed. And yes we were seated and served promptly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
Randall G.,"Harrisburg, PA",33,207,445,3.0,3/9/2017,"Chili's is a chain I will choose when I am pressed to chose a chain Resturant for dinner because I generally can find something on the menu I enjoy.  This location is average. The menu is fine, pretty standard available online menu. Nothing stands out as an exceptional dish but then again, I don't expect it too.  I do appreciate that my soda was refilled without asking, thank you ;-)  The service is fine. Again, nothing stands out however nothing is lacking.  This location is difficult for ingress and egress because the mall parking lot is very poorly laid out. Luckily this location is on an out pad close to the main drag and not too unmanageable like much of the mall, target and wegemans sadly :-(  This is a place I would choose with friends who would prefer a chain so that they would be happy and I would fine something on the menu I too would enjoy.   Thank you for waiting on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
Allison H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",135,329,670,3.0,10/3/2016,"As far as chains go, this one is managed pretty well. It's clean, service is decent and they change up the menu occasionally. Try their asparagus appetizer, totally yummy!  Their meat bowls weren't the best in my opinion, but overall I will return for drinks and maybe their baby back ribs or fajitas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
April S.,"PORT MONMOUTH, NJ",17,43,3,3.0,4/22/2017,"We asked the hostess if we could have 3 tablets since we had 3 kids, 2 five year olds and 3 year old. She brought one extra so 2 kids had to share. After a while, i got up to use the restroom and discovered a whole section of tables not being seated with tablets on them. I didn't realise all those empty tables needed them as much as sharing one more would have made our experience better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
Daniel G.,"Harrisburg, PA",98,217,2676,3.0,9/27/2014,"Nothing wrong with this chain, but I don't go often as I find other places more appealing. Not much else to say. Haven't had a bad meal or experience so I can't complain.  -Decent-",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
Matthew D.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",30,9,,1.0,3/27/2016,"Good service, terrible food.  I don't expect much from a chain restaurant like this but I expect to be able to eat the food.  The boneless wings appetizer tasted like they had not changed the fryer oil in weeks.  The manager literally said they have a high tech fryer that changes the oil 30 times a day....suuuuure buddy.  The manager took the largely uneaten meals off of our bill but not without asking what specifically we didn't like about them.  He apparently didn't like the answer that they simply tasted awful and wanted something more specific.    If you crave a restaurant like chilli's do yourself a favor and visit the TGI Fridays just down the pike. I have never had a bad meal there and would say it's the best experience I have had at a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2

Joey P.,"Harrisburg, PA",35,49,31,1.0,4/11/2015,"They sat my large party into a small table. The pace was ultra slow.  Food was cold and had to wait longer since many items brought where wrong. We had to get our own place settings and no refills on drinks. Poor overall experience.  We came here because we had a gift card.  Would have rather used it to as an ice scrapper from my cars windshield.  Shitty food, horrible employees, and no manager on site to talk to.

Eric W.,"Catawissa, PA",26,328,1013,4.0,4/6/2014,"Stopped in here late night on a Saturday and received immediate seating. We had enough fatty foods today and were looking for something different, and it had been a few years since I've had Chili's. After looking over the menu we ended up going with the $2 for 20 Fajitas, which came as a do it yourself assembly plate with the Chicken, Peppers, and Onions on one plate, the Cheese and Pico on the other, and a plate with 3 Tortillas. We didn't expect that and it was cool. Food was delicious.

Our server was nice and very attentive. Ordered a specialty burger (I forget what they called it) medium well that came out over well. I ate most of it anyway. We liked the little computer/tablet they have on the tables. We played a game of ""life"" while we were there. That was fun. Paying on there after was nice too. Hubby wasn't really thrilled with his meal as I remember him commenting but I can't remember what he ordered.

The food was good - nothing extraordinary, but it was the service that made last night's visit so much better than the others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
John G.,"Camp Hill, PA",80,246,109,3.0,9/30/2011,Ate here the other night. Had the trio fajita it was real good shrimp was a little tough but that's what you get (probably frozen shrimp). Anyways wife had a bowl of chili??? For a place named Chili's you think the chili would have some flavor. Her words not mine. She also ordered the southwestern egg rolls these were pretty good. I ordered rice and black beans as a side they were a good compliment to the fajitas. The fajita wraps were small you actually would need six but they only gave you three. The 6-8inch size would fit the bill. Service was slow food was hot. Price was good for the quantity. If your hungry it's ok but I rather a Mexican Restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mechanicsburg-2
