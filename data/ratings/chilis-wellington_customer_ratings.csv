Joey is probably the best waiter I've had. You never had to flag him down and he paid very close attention. My husband and I never even had to ask for a refill. Before our drinks were empty he would come out with the refill. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because one of the managers brought out my food. Notice how I said 'my' and not 'our'.

My husband ordered fajitas that when they were brought out looking more like boiled meat than fajitas.  Then had to wait for condiments. No sizzle no color to the meat. I ordered the sour cream enchiladas with extra sauce. My order came out with no sauce. When I told the waitress I asked for extra sour cream sauce she brought me out cold sour cream. When I clarified that I wanted sour cream sauce she brought me out cold sauce. After asking for the manager she had my plate redone.  I did have to sit and wait for the remake while my whole family ate their food and then proceed to eat alone when the food finally made it out to the table. What left me the most flabbergasted was that after all that hassle, wait and inconvenience to the customer the manager choose to not take the enchiladas off the ticket nor did she offer a free dessert or anything to make up for the trouble.  Very disappointing service.  Will probably not go back to this location.

We went to eat the molten chocolate cake, I haven't had this dessert in over 3 years and it was delectable in many ways.  It was warm and moist with a volcanic chocolate covered dome with vanilla ice cream.   This Chili's location is nice, it was my first time here but overall the company seems like they have improved their seating with colorful arrays of colors on the wall, contemporary style lighting and ziosk.  Ziosk are computer tablets where you can order desserts/refill of drinks, pay for your check without having to wait etc.  I like their strategies as a company to move forward with technology and stay relevant.   The restaurant itself was not that busy at 6 pm but the floors were messy and slippery.  We sat on one of the bar tables, our server was attentive and quick.  We ended up getting the 2 for $20 which has one appetizer to share and two entrees.  This deal has been going on for a few years now.  The cheesy jalapeño fries were a let down, the cheese was over cooked and it had dried out.  On to the entrees: Cajun shrimp pasta was good, the mango salsa and tilapia was decent but next time sauce on the side for that, it was a tad bit too sweet.   By the end of the meal we were stuffed, the portions are big for entrees.  However, we braved out and ate the molten chocolate cake, and were ready for nap time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.348,3.3600000000000003

This was my first visit to the Wellington mall location and it did not disappoint. From the outside it looks as if they have redone the place and the inside has also been refurbished.  The management has also kept up with the times and every table has a tablet from which you can order and pay for your meal. This is very convenient and using it for the first time I think more restaurants will catch up with this idea. Now the server is still a very integral part of the equation as they make sure your order is correct and bring it out immediately.  We ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta and the tilapia as part of the 2 for $20 dinner and later as dessert even though we were full ordered the molten chocolate cake which was super delicious and made my evening.  My recommendation: if you head towards Chilis and decide not to have their desserts you are missing out in a big way !!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.384,3.4000000000000004

The items on the 2 for $20 menu seem to get worse every time we are there. The chipotle chicken crispers get spicier and greasier every time to cover up the lack of actual flavor, not to mention it seems like we are getting one crisper less every time we are there.

17,Carrie P.,"Wellington, FL",114,15,1.0,1.0,2016-08-25,"Took my daughter's to this location last night and was quite appalled at EVERYTHING from the time we walked in until we left (without finishing our dinner).  I would like to begin telling about my experience by stating that I have worked at Chili's in NC years ago so I know how things should be run from not only a customers P.O.V. but also a former employees P.O.V.  When we walked in their was no hostess at the front for at least 3 minutes and their were two other families standing with us. It wasn't busy inside so the hostess had no reason to NOT be standing at her hostess stand and greeting customers as they walked in. The manager finally walks over to seat us and when the server comes to the table he is looking everywhere OTHER THAN at us, the customers at his table. He took our drink and appetizer order. Someone else grabbed our appetizer and delivered it to us while our server grabbed our drinks. He took our order again while not ever looking at us and that was the last time we ever had him at our table. We needed refills before our meal came but couldn't find our waiter. The young lady that ran our food out to us got us refills on our drinks as she saw they were empty. My daughter needed salt for her dish and no salt would come out of the shaker. I looked at it for her and noticed that the lid of the salt shaker was caked over with, what I can only guess and hope was, dried black beans juice. Again, no server ever came to the table so I couldn't ask for another one.  We did not finish our individual meals and we sat and waited for someone to pay us some attention to get us some boxes. Again, no one ever came. I told my daughter's that were no longer going to wait on anyone so I paid on the tables kiosk and we left VERY unsatisfied.  The manager never even came by to check on any tables. The wait staff walked through the kitchen while singing rap songs to each other but once they came around the corner into the dining room they had the worst looks on their faces. They made it quite obvious that they didn't like their jobs and the manager made it quite obvious with how the store was being run that he either didn't care or was unable to get a hold on his staff. Someone needs to visit this store and get a handle on everything because that was an absolute mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
18,Jill C.,"Wellington, FL",44,67,,3.0,2016-08-27,"Hadn't been to Chili's in a very long time so we thought we would give it a try. First the good: Food was fine.  Not great.  Not bad.  Just fine.  I had grilled chicken my husband had a burger.  Our waiter was very good.  Gave us just the right amount of attention and was very professional. I liked how they text you when your table is ready; thought that was a good idea. Now for the bad. The place is dirty.  First table we were sat at was very dirty.  Second table was a bit cleaner.  All around us we saw people asking to have their tables cleaned.  Don't they bus their tables. We were seated at a half booth.  My husband was just standing there because he did not have a chair.  They finally brought one. The music.  It was blasting.  Really, really blasting.  When my husband asked if it could be turned down, the manager acted like it was a big deal.  But he did it.  Funny thing is, the music was turned down about 3 more times while we were there.  You want background music not concert level music.  Wonder how many wrong orders are taken because the server can't hear the order. All and all it was okay.  Would we go back?  Yes.  Will it be next week?  No.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
39,Mark Z.,"West Palm Beach, FL",2,9,,1.0,2016-10-26,"This location is consistently terrible. Several months ago we went for dinner on a Friday night only to wait a good 45 minutes for only two people with open tables available. When we asked the manager he said they werent staffed right so they werent seating people at open tables. Meanwhile the line was out the door. We stopped going but made the mistake again this past Friday. Same exact story but worse. Not only were there open tables and people not seated, same reason by the way, we waited 40 minutes for our food once we did sit down. Prior to getting the food we complained to the manager who apologized and went to the back and our food came out. The food was cold!! My shrimp looked translucent like it wasnt even cooked. We called the manager over, told him we had enough and were leaving without having eaten. Terrible service, terrible waiting time, terrible management of having staff and terrible food. If there was a zero star i would give it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

44,Eric C.,"Wellington, FL",57,3,,2.0,2017-02-01,"Went to Chili's this evening. I used to love the chain. The menu had changed a lot over the years. What was once a comfortable eatery is now LOUD with rock music playing constantly with mediocre but expensive food.  The waitress was nice enough, even though she neglected refilling my iced tea. She took about 15 minutes from the time we got the bill to the time she got around to actually taking payment (which had been on the table that entire 15 minutes). Meanwhile, as the music was turned up to the point my wife and I could no longer hear each other talk, my wife felt compelled to wait outside until the waitress collected payment. She waited in the cold for an additional 10 minutes. I waited at the table alone, no refill on the iced tea and the waitress ignoring me as I tried to get her attention to take my freaking payment.  The food was slightly above average, but I was still hungry after the dinner. Smaller portions than before.  We won't be going back any time soon. There are way better places to go, and for less money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

7,Morgan D.,"Plant City, FL",10,22,8.0,2.0,2017-03-22,"I gave a two star review because the food was as decent as it can be for Chili's. I don't have very high expectations usually because I find their food to be overall flavorless and poor quality.  However, I agreed to go with a co-worker after work last night. My friend got there before I did and sat at the bar. Big mistake... When I showed up, the woman behind the bar, who obviously hated her life and her job, walked over and said something to the effect of, ""What do you want?"" I didn't know at that moment what my beverage was going to be. Instead of perhaps telling me some things on special, she walked away.  My friend had to lean over the bar to grab me a menu so I could browse the drinks. She finally came back and I gave my drink order. Now, I have been a bartender for over 12 years in corporate and unincorporated restaurants and there is one thing that I know to be true; Smiling gets you more tips and makes a guest want to return!  We didn't get one smile from this woman. Not. One.   Subsequently, I literally had to get the bartender's attention for every, single item we ordered or needed from our appetizer, to silverware, to a glass of water, and then the check. Mind you, she had one other couple at the bar the entire time and one man who was unfortunate enough to find himself in the same predicament we were in, sat down midway through our dinner. At one point, I heard him ask for some hot sauce and she shoved the pepper shaker at him!  I tipped her 20% because as a former restauranteur, I understand that every day is not a great day. Maybe she's losing her house or her kid isn't doing well in school and she was distracted from properly executing her job. Now looking back on it, I regret my 20% tip that went to someone that was absolutely miserable and hate the fact that we practically served ourselves.  Worst service without a smile.  PS- Chili's, you can save your generic ""We are sorry to hear that, please give us another try"" response. If a store manager can't take the time to personally respond to your guests' comments, then I can't take the time to try your awful restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

13,Madison K.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,2017-08-17,"So I've been to this chilli's before but this time it took 25 minutes just to get a water on the table and 15 minutes for our server (chrisie) to notice we were sitting in her section, it was very slow so that didn't make much sense. She took app order and never came back to take  entree order, the apps came out and we had no plates, when asked for she had forgotten and by that time we were done with the apps.. then she finally came over to take the Order which took 45 minutes to come out... finally when coming to pay she gave us the check, and  it had multiple other tables orders on it. The  server kept telling us ""oh it's fixed now check again"" and still left multiple items from another table on the check. Very disappointed in this chillis and the server we were given and this was on a extremely slow night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

3,Jaclyn V.,"Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA",0,9,1.0,1.0,2017-12-15,I wish that I could give this place a zero rating. The absolute worst restaurant service I have ever had. It only took 5 minutes to sit down and from there it went downhill. It took the server 15 minutes to greet the table and by the time we got our drinks it was 22 minutes from the time we sat down. I had to ask a host to get our server before she even came to the table. When she came to get out drink order we decided to order our food as well. It took another 30 minutes to get our food and when it came out my husbands food didn't come out. I found the manager and spoke to him and asked why it took so long to get drinks and food and he tried to tell me that it was only 30 minutes from time we sat to the time we got our food. He began to argue with me and I told him we would pay for our drinks and leave. When he came back with the drink receipt he wouldn't show me the ticket from when the server took our order to see that she did take longer than he had said. I felt so disrespected and he made me feel like I was lying and that he didn't believe me. So unprofessional!!! He argued back and forth and snatched the drink receipt from in front of me and said to just go and to not worry about the drinks! WILL NEVER RETURN!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
1,Jessica P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,22,65.0,2.0,2018-01-11,Wanted to grab a quick bite and use a coupon for a free guacamole appetizer. Once we got there the host quoted us 25 minutes so we decided to wait. They use your phone number to text you when your table is ready. We waited close to an hour before being seated. Once I received a text that our table was ready and went to the hostess. There I was asked for my name and waited again to be taken to our table. Two other parties that came after us were seated and then I was asked again for my name and were seated. It was annoying and very unorganized especially since the parties that came after us were larger/ or equal size to be seated before us. Service was ok since it was a busier time. Food was alright but that's what you get for Chili's. It's nice to be able to pay at the table kiosk with a card so you don't have to wait for the waiter. Not my ideal restaurant but it would do at a less busier time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wellington,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
