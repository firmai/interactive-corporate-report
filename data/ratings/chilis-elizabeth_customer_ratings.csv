73,Nancy H.,"Hillsborough, NJ",1,19,,1.0,2012-01-18,"I've been to alot of Chili's and this is by far the worst ever.  The bathrooms were utterly disgusting, water on the floor, water dripping off the sink spilling onto the floor, someone could slip and fall.  My daughter asked for a simple cheeseburger.  It arrived practically raw!  We sent it back.  After probably 15 minutes, I had finished my salad, her burger arrives, with mustard one it.  We told the waitress, she wanted to give us a new bun, which she did.  Meanwhile the mustard was embedded in the meat so for anyone who doesn't like mustard, it was a no go. Service was crappy, we never had the same person.  The only person who attempted to rectify our problem was the host, a young guy.   Needless to say, next time I shop at Jersey Gardens, I will avoid this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth?start=60,1.124,1.124,1.124,1.124,1.124

I asked for my burger to be cooked medium well; I received it medium rare - leaning more towards the ""rare.""  The server did not deserve the 20% tip I left ( always leave 20%, will leave more if it's better service - I'm an ex server...what can I say) and the manager was rude and not accommodating at all. I receive Chili's specials via e-mail, when I tried to redeem a free desert, the manager on duty said no, no explanation offered.  I think corporate needs to remove it's name from this location or make participation mandatory.

They're just flavorless, ground up meat. It's sort of like the beer of foods. It doesn't taste good but you love it anyway.  The restaurant itself could be cleaner. I understand it's pretty busy and the waitresses were doing their best to get things done quickly. Be careful ordering alcohol here, the prices aren't on the menu and for a good reason...

I always get a waiter/waitress who really doesn't look like they're interested in being there If you're so unhappy, don't work there. Keep in mind this is not a regular Chili's, it's a Chili's Too.  They have a different menu than the regular Chili's and the food is not of the same quality as a Chili's. The last time I was here just really pissed me off. The hostess tells us that we have to wait for the table to be cleaned. It took 10 minutes for a table to be cleaned! Anyway, once thee table is finally cleaned and my boyfriend and I are finally seated, we waited another 10 minutes someone to come over to take our order but no one ever did! We look over to the bar and there's about 4 or 5 waitresses hanging out and talking. Meanwhile there are about 4 tables that had to be waited on!

70,JJ J.,"Hudson County, NJ",25,173,84.0,1.0,2012-11-17,"Ok, eating here was the ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AT ANY EATERY!! There is NO WAY I could ever reccomend this place, even to someone I didn't care to much for! This is a ""Chili's Too"" so it carries the brand name but with a limited menu that like others have said, is not of the same quality by any means! My husband and  popped in here for a quick bite while shopping. We were seated and our waitress came out a while later for our order. We ordered drinks, and appetizer, soups and salads and dinner.    We never saw anyone again....About 20 minutes later a NASTY and I do emphasize NASTY bowl of soup came out for me..where was my husbands? Then our drinks....then nothing. No one even looked at us to see if we were ok. All the while workers were cleaning tables with windex that was flying all in the air, you could tase it in your mouth and everyone was complaining....yet it continued.  About 20 minutes after that, our dinner came out, with a side salad that was now given to my husband, but what happened to the appetizer? Our new waiter explained that our old waiter never told him about it ?????? What? I asked about the soup/ salad screw up and he was totally confused...So I just asked for a refill on my soda.....no one ever came back! After ten minutes I finally got up and approached a hostess, asking them for soda b/c no one else was around. Ten minutes later, they brought me one. After all of this nonsense, we simply asked for the bill and wanted to get out of there. In th meantime, people at the tables on either side of us both complained of mixed up or forgotten orders...ridiculous! The bill was a MESS, there were all sorts of things that they never served us but were attempting to charge us for. The appetizer that was once forgotten, was now appearing on our bill...seriously?! So after that was squared away, I approached the manager who looked like a deer in the headlights...She simply said ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" and handed me free chips and salsa coupons for when I COME BACK?! I explained to her that we would never be back but will be more then happy to use them at a different location and promptly left.  Please, steer clear!

Waitress apologized & took 15% off the bill. They don't do the 2 for $20 dinner deals, food is much more expensive than at any other Chili's. Bad service, dirty tables.

39,Ashley C.,"Edison, NJ",379,38,129.0,1.0,2014-08-15,"To be honest, I do not want to give this restaurant any stars. Although I am not a fan of any chain restaurants, if I had to choose one on the fly it would be Chili's (probably because it was always conveniently located near my house). My friends know I frequent this chain, and therefore when celebratory occasions occur, they get me gift certificates. Shopping at the Jersey Gardens Mall with my girlfriend, I decided why not treat her for lunch at that Chili's location. This specific location and experience has forever changed my outlook and opinion on the Chili's establishments.  First off, let me just say, had I visited the rest room PRIOR to BARELY eating my BLAND lunch, I would have NEVER ordered anything at this restaurant. The bathroom reminded me of porter potties that have been sitting at a carnival for months. It stunk, was filthy, and soap was limited. They cannot keep their bathroom clean, so what would make me think their kitchen is any cleaner? Secondly, the food lacked flavor, and was cold when served. The salad I ordered was wilted and gross. Since I was myself a server, I am not the type to send back my food nor blame the server for the quality of my food. Instead, I pay, leave, and inform the public about how horrible their experience will be if they ever choose to visit this establishment.  Lastly, my friend and I were one of 3 tables in that place during lunch (which probably should have been a sign from the very beginning). I accidentally left a folder with personal papers on the table upon leaving the restaurant. But FIRST we used the restroom. Therefore, staff had already began cleaning our table while we were STILL in the restaurant. Did they approach me  to tell me that I left something? Absolutely not. I realized when I got to my car, I forgot it, called immediately, and they informed me they found NOTHING. Those were personal items I will never be able to reproduce so you can imagine how disappointed I am in myself (for forgetting) and this establishment (for their dishonesty).  Thus, because of my poor experience, I will NEVER return to this Chili's establishment again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth?start=20,1.4,1.4,1.4,1.4760000000000002,1.4

I work for a chain restaurant and been in this business 13+ years, so I understand there are times when there are long waits, waitresses that give poor service, etc! Been there. My daughter and I came here as a last resort seeing as the food court was packed. Looking back I would of rather waited for a table to clear out there then pay to eat at chili's too! We had a 15-20 minute wait, our names were called within 10. Our host sat us a table that was clearly dirty as it was ""flagged"" with a ketchup bottle, meaning in our industry the table needs to be wiped. He picked up the bottle and with his hand wiped the crumbs and straw wrapper to the floor! We should of left then. Sadly we stayed. Took another 10 minutes to be greeted in which I have the complete order to the server. Ordered apperizer-child's meal, and soup and salad for myself. Took the server another 10 minutes just to get our drinks.  My water had some unknown black substance floating in it.  We never even got our appetizer. Just our meals in which the chili was terrible I did complain about that. It was taken off the bill.

Well, their 40cl Stella glass with a solid 1+"" head is not 20 oz! After doing a quick online search, it was easily established that 40cl is 13.526 us fluid ounces! (The bar tried to convince us that this was in fact the 20oz glass. It has been well disputed that this glass is not.) When my husband brought this to the manager's attention he a) refused to tell my husband how much the 14 oz beer was so that we could get the difference taken off our bill, and b) he offered to take 10% off the cost of each beer?! That came to a whopping $2 and some change off the entire bill. All the while, he agreed that it wasn't right and proceeded to throw the bartender under the bus. I will be reporting this restaurant to the state liquor agency for them to look into this issue.  2ndly, my husband and I ordered the ""classic nachos"" to share. (Nachos were not pictured or labeled in the menu) When I hear ""classic nachos"" I expect classic nachos. I expect a pile of tortilla chips with all of the accompaniments. Plus, we even threw in the guacamole for the buck and three quarters up charge.

24,Reed M.,"Port Matilda, PA",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-20,Chili's charges $4.99 extra if you substitute a bean burger for the meat burger.  I have never before been charged extra for a veggie burger.  The menu does not say it cost more.  What a surprise!   Bad way to run a restaurant.  Slow and inattentive service to boot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth?start=20,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
15,Ju M.,"Paterson, NJ",51,1,,1.0,2017-06-30,The service in this place is the worst! They take forever to take your order. They NEVERRR answer the phone. The employees are always standing around and talking to each other. I went there a few times always the same thing. And I'm not the only one who says this i have heard the same issue from multiple people. There's an Applebees downstairs I prefer to go to them!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
23,Leandro R.,"Downtown Jersey City, Jersey City, NJ",46,1,,1.0,2017-07-04,Worst Chilis service ever... horrible staff completely lost. It was July 4th but you know.

5,Nina A.,"Garfield, NJ",0,37,73.0,4.0,2017-08-18,"The food was pretty good, & the portions were large. Our waitress was very nice. It's a chain restaurant, nothing special.

16,Kamal B.,"Woodbridge, Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-24,"The pathetic place. Very very irresponsible staff who they don't care about the guests. I went in there with my family, I was given a table however for 25 minutes no body came to take the orders. I would have excused them if the restaurant would have been busy but it was 60% occupied at max. After 25 minutes we decided to move out and nobody cared about it. I would suggest a very big NO for this restaurant if you are in this mall and would like to have food, the food court has better options and quick service. I wish I can give 0 star to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

7,Austin C.,"Kenilworth, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-29,"Came to this place right after I got out of work, was seated within 10 seconds of entering. Employees yelling at each other to mop floors very poor resturant service. I ordered a half rack of ribs with French fires I told the waitress that I wanted the ""dry rub"" on the ribs because I have acid reflex and I can't have BBQ sauce without having incredible amount of pain in my chest. What do I get? A half rack of ribs loaded with BBQ sauce and cold hard French fries which took a hour to come out to me, I waited for almost 30mins and no one was around for me to say anything about the error, so I took napkins and wiped the bbq sauce off as best as possible. Never will I ever come back here, this place should be shut down asap",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
3,Danny T.,"Issaquah, WA",46,4,,1.0,2017-12-05,"Poor service.  We waited 15 minutes and the table next to us waited over 20. Asked to speak to a manager and she took our order but that took another 20 minutes.  Food came out and our server appeared angry we were bothering her.  Our server came by once after that to see if everything was good.   Never saw her again.  No silverware, no refills, no nothing.   Went back to the manager to get our bill and we got our chips and salsa taken off the bill. Almost missed our flight because of the poor service!  Not recommended at all!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003

Unprofessional bartender sagging his pants and pulling them up every 30 seconds.  Bad experience all together.  I actually saw 6 people leave because they waited too long for service.

0,Tony A.,"Sacramento, CA",1194,606,2198.0,3.0,2017-12-27,"I'm NOT a huge fan of the ""corporate machine"" chains like Chili's but, I am a fan of keeping my family happy.  So while walking around The Mills at Jersey Gardens shopping center and the family wanted to eat; here I am. The date is December 26, 2017.  One day after Xmas and EVERYONE living in and around Jersey is here to catch the sales or exchange a gift.  Theres a line for every eatery inside the mall, including Chili's.  But to their credit, we didn't have to wait for a table of five.  Right in and to our seats but, that's where the CUDOS stop.   The wait for our initial server was about five minutes.  We placed drink orders and away she went.  Where??  I don't have a clue.  Ten minutes later, two of our five drinks arrived.  The rest arrived about five minutes later.   After the drinks arrived, we asked questions about the menu items and placed our orders for an appetizer and our meals. ** NOTE **   According to my family who seem to have visited Chili's ether often or are in the know how things work told me when guacamole is ordered, its normally prepared table side.  Not ours.  It arrived table side already mixed.  I did notice the table next to ours had ordered the guacamole and their server was working hard preparing theres at their table.   Normally when we dine out.  We're still in the middle of our appetizers when the main dish comes out.  NOT so today.  In fact, our server had to bring out more chips and apologized for the long delay with our meals. About twenty five minutes past and our server arrived saying she had bad news.  ""Our cooks didn't expect the large crowd today and they ran out of the batter for the waffles.""  She then asked if my son and I wanted to order something else from the menu which she just happened to have in her hand when I asked to see the menu again.  Things that make you say ""hum."" Almost an hour since our arrival and all of food made it to the table.  The buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered was mediocre okay.  Eatable but nothing to brag about. Final thoughts... I think this Chili's has an awesome location and has the potential to do and have a great business.  But, those running the establishment need to pay attention to the patrons concerns, wishes and reviews.  Service is slow and comes with excuses.  Attitude reflects leadership.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-elizabeth,1.52,1.52,1.52,,1.5200000000000002
