Sharon H.,"Sun City West, AZ",2,62,21,3.0,5/20/2016,"Lunch outside is always fantastic this time of year.  Chicken fingers for kids were crispy and hot and grilled cheese sandwich was delicious.  Adults had small plates of lettuce wrapped chicken tacos ( one went Asian with sprouts, peanut sauce and tomatoes and the other Mexican with corn salsa, avocado and cheese) and a chicken Caesar salad.  All were delicious but in general, way to much food was served.  It is a shame to have so much food left.  The grilled cheese sandwiches were actually two each and the Caesar salad although described as small could serve four people.  Service was good but tables way to close together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80
Dorette P.,"Tampa, FL",4,36,80,4.0,8/25/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory never fails! Although it's large chain restaurant they do it well. The menu is extensive, if you can't find anything to your liking.....your the problem!  I had the fried catfish tender on the inside and crunchy crust on the outside, served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Our server was Melissa,  she's the best. Attentive without being intrusive.  The drinks are always good and of course so is the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80
Kimberly H.,"Glassboro, NJ",56,5,,5.0,6/19/2016,"Love this location! I come here quite frequently with my friends and it never disappoints. The wait never bothers us because the buzzers work while you're in the mall, so you're able to do some shopping instead of sitting around doing nothing. They will even wait for you to get back to the restaurant before giving up your table. The wait staff is always friendly and their drinks are delicious. Make sure you save room for dessert as the cheesecake is fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80
Bob M.,"Annandale, NJ",0,82,5,1.0,1/1/2016,"If I could give zero stars, I would.  Went here for dinner with friends.  Spent over $200 for microwaved food.  Friends picked up the tab for their first charge in months on her.  credit card.  Needless to say, fraudulent charge alerts started blowing up her phone overnight.  I called the restaurant to complain adjacent the GM Dan took no responsibility for the problem.  In fact, he told me that he took these matters seriously and that his server L. J. WOULD NEVER STEAL credit card info.  He didn't even offer a comp dinner to make it right.

Jen G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,6,,2.0,1/6/2016,"So I just was here tonight with my fiancé, I ordered the vegan salad and she ordered a hamburger. Everything was fine, till I got back home. I had gotten horrible food poisoning from my salad. I don't know why, because it was suposed to be gluten-free, but somehow I got very ill. I am still not feeling well at all from it. Funny thing is that we have been here before and I never really got this ill. I usually would have just gotten a bit of a stomach ache or something small. I order the same thing all the time.

Rachel B.,"New Brunswick, NJ",42,17,3,1.0,7/10/2016,"Horrible, borderline humiliating experience. They are not very accommodating if you bring a baby, and the hostess was so unhelpful and just giggled when she didn't know a response to a question or request for help. I was meeting a friend and had my toddler with me for lunch. I needed a highchair for him, but they WOULD NOT provide me with one if I wanted to bring the stroller (very compact in a restaurant that was 15% full max) in with me. The stroller has all his mealtime things and is also a place he likes to sit when he gets bored of a highchair after he finishes eating, as all toddlers do after eating quickly. But, even though I tried to explain this nicely, and there was plenty of room, nope!  At one point I said to the hostess, ""I don't know if you have kids or not, but here's why I think this would help...""  She giggled into her hand like a school girl and turned away. WTF?!  We made it through the meal, but I could hardly eat because I had to try to keep a toddler on an adult seat the whole time. And of course he dropped a few pieces of food on the floor, which of course I will pick up in addition to always tipping very generously when I bring the baby in case of any mess I couldn't manage to clean up myself. But I got the cold shoulder treatment. They simply didn't want young children in here. Would have been nice to know in advance. At one point when I was getting the side-eye from one of the staff due to my toddler touching the mirror placed behind his (adult!) seat and getting hand prints on it (highchair would have helped with this, guys!) I muttered to my friend, ""They hate me here, don't they?  I can never come back here.""  He replied, ""Yeah, not sure why, but definitely getting a frigid vibe in relation to your presence, LOL!""  Why did it have to be like this?  Worst and most humiliating lunch ever. Never going back, with or without my child, who, by the way, was very good for a toddler that day!  Unbelievable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80
Erin C.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,1,,1.0,8/4/2016,"Never have I had such a horrible experience with a take out order. I know that things happen and you really shouldn't judge a restruant based on this but it was plain ridiculous. Called and had them repeat the order 3 times, go there and it was competly wrong. So we waited on them to make the order again and we get it home and it was competly wrong AGAIN. There is no excuse for this and we had to eat what they gave us cause this whole ordeal was 2 hours long and we were not about to go back.

Pete M.,"New York, NY",200,285,102,3.0,3/19/2015,After a rough start at a large team dinner (40 people) staff pulled off a good experience. Place was its usual hectic pace and then this 40 person dinner so understandable delay. Certain we would have ordered more wine and booze has waiters had time - management should have thought that thru given the reservation made well in advance - but we saved on the expense budget (to Cheesecakes loss).  Food being a chain has limited appeal but all in all ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80
Crimson M.,"Flemington, NJ",18,71,39,4.0,2/9/2015,"I've been here 4 times and ordered the same dessert the first 2 times--pineapple upside down cheesecake. So good! The last 2 times I had their lemon meringue cheesecake---wow! The Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake is amazing, too---my son's gotten it every time.    I've had their Factory Burrito Grande; it was huge and delicious.  It's not on the menu anymore, but their Chicken Katsu was amazing!

Grisel A.,"Bound Brook, NJ",0,2,,1.0,6/21/2016,"I am so disappointed at the treatment me and my family received by 2 hostesses at this cheese cake factory restaurant. My family and I go there regularly and on June 7,2016 we arrived there a little past 7pm. I asked the hostess (short girl with black hair probably Hispanic), how long for a family of 5, she said about 25 mins. We sat to wait, but time went by and other people coming in after us were being seated. 1 hour passed by and a family of 4 came in and was seated immediately but we were still waiting for over 1 hour. I stood up to ask why we hadn't been seated and a few families similar to ours had been. There was now a 2nd hostess with curly black or brown hair which very rude told me a table for 4 is not the same as a table for 5. I understand that but there was no need for very rude attitude she gave me. When we were finally called to be seated she gave my daughter a kids menu, but being that in the past they'd give crayons and something for the child to color, after being seated I went to ask if there were any crayons. Both girls the short Hispanic one with straight hair and lot of make up and the other thin one with the curly hair they both looked at me with some anger in Their faces and just said ""we no longer give out crayons"". Even my 2 boys asked why did they talk to me with such attitude. After waiting for more than 1 hour to be seated when we finally were seated the table was wet and the check and cash from the previous guests were still on top of the table. I went to let them know that the payment for the previous meal was on our table and the short girl with straight hair again very rudely just said ""the server will take it"". There was no ""Thank you for letting us know"" there was never ""we apologize for the wait"", nothing! After 3 times of getting attitude and unprofessional treatment from the hostesses we just didn't feel welcome and stood up and left to another restaurant that welcomed us and didn't make us wait over an hour. These 2 girls were extremely rude and unprofessional. They must be trained on how to treat guests. It is a shame that a family of 5 that used to eat there regularly will not longer do so because the 2 people that should feel guests welcome have an unacceptable way of treating cheese cake factory's customers. HORRIBLE TREATMENT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80

Jas C.,"Bridgewater, NJ",39,42,1,5.0,5/10/2015,"Predictably great, friendly service, always be prepared to wait awhile at peak hour.  The cheesecakes are always a solid choice for dessert, favorites are the Tuxedo and the seasonal Peppermint flavored ones.  Love their Peach Bellini, and favorites are their generous, healthy, and fresh salads.  Thai appetizer is also very commonly ordered.

Ken K.,"White House Station, NJ",3,21,,1.0,8/14/2016,"Sunday Brunch - I'll start off by saying the food was good, no complaints there.  Service on the other hand, was so slow I thought everyone was on break!  Arrived @ 10:15am, they open @ 10:00am, wasn't to crowded yet.  The server took our full order immediately, and then vanished!   10:25am, one tomato juice arrived, the runner asked if we were waiting on anything else, (coffee, OJ, and 2 waters)  our server cruised by and said the coffee is brewing!!!  Brewing??? It's 10:25am, they should never be waiting on coffee to brew, especially on Sunday brunch!!!  10:30 ish coffee, OJ and the waters appeared.  And then, what I think was the manager finally showed up, and asked if everything was okay.  Well... I told her it was extremely slow... And I wanted to say more, but I had a lot of children in the area.  10:45am food arrived, omelette, crab hash with poached eggs took 30 min to complete (Gordon would not be happy with this level of service).  11:00am check came, and I gave her my Visa card at the same time she gave us the check.  I should've opened and checked first, but I didn't want to be there any longer.  Bottom line; $58.72 for breakfast for 2, decent food, with slow motion service.  And, it was breakfast folks, not a brunch, but breakfast... a true brunch, you wouldn't be ordering ala-carte off their menu.  So, if you are looking for a true brunch, with good service, great food, in a timely manner, the Cheesecake Factory @ the Bridgewater commons is NOT the place to go folks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80

I would rate for food and originality a  three. But, our server was really wonderful, so I rated 4 stars. This was a reunion with an old friend and we had a great time. The turn over here is very high - this is part of the Bridgewater Mall. But, no one gave us a hard time or rushed us in any way. The food was good - way too much to actually have Cheesecake.

Ariel M.,"Westfield, NJ",40,87,102,4.0,1/9/2018,"I came here for lunch on a week day, and it was packed. We had to wait almost an hour for a table of 4. We started with a round of drinks, I went with their signature Martini. Their menu is so extensive it takes a while to look through everything and decide what you want. For appetizers we had the loaded tater tots and the Korean Cauliflower. The Cauliflower was DELICIOUS! I would definitely recommend that.  I ordered the Avocado Toast for my main course and it was much larger than I thought; it was more of an avocado baguette. Very filling- i took half of it home. My family ordered the Mac & Cheese Burger, Truffle Grilled Cheese Sticks and a Salad. Everyone was happy with their food; it was al great quality and big portions.  We took some classic, chocolate and carrot cheese cakes home; you can't go wrong with their deserts.  Staff was friendly and attentive; we didn't feel rushed at all during our meal.

Checked out the cheesecakes while we waited 10 minutes for our table... They served us some delicious bread and butter to start and got our drinks while we looked over the menu.  Looked over their specials for the day and the Truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks caught my eye for an app and we also got some calamari to start. I loved the grilled cheese sticks they were a nice change from the standards. The calamari was also very good.  For the entrees I almost always order the same thing... The farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic it's one of my favorite pasta dishes so I enjoyed that as usual. We also ordered the combination dish of Steak Diane and shrimp scampi with some brown rice and that was great too.  Service was excellent and unfortunately no room for dessert today....

I am usually satisfied with the dishes I order . The portions are Farley big and tasty depending on the dish. Unless you go with the skinny menu things are portioned pretty good for less calories dishes. As far as the servers are concerned some are good and very attentive, some even go over the top by taking notice you need a refill on a drink without asking or cleaning the table as dishes are done. Then you have some that take your order and you never see them again until you are almost done.

Natalie A.,"Clark, NJ",50,204,460,3.0,10/4/2017,Only came to this Cheesecake Factory to do a pickup order of cheesecake. It was tucked into the back section of the mall but there was plenty of parking and even some to go spots that I was able to park in and run in.  My order was ready when I got there and customer service was great but I did find that the cheesecake at this location taste it different than others I have been to. Some of the cheesecake slices that I picked up we're also very tiny and cut smaller than usual. All in all the cheesecake was great but I think I prefer other locations better.  I had ordered the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate tasted a little different I'm wondering whether it was sitting out for over a day or if it was actually made differently I'm not sure if the cheesecakes are just shipped to the store directly so perhaps it was just old. I also picked up an Adams peanut butter cheesecake and the slice was almost half the size of the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake. It was sliced thinly and the end of the slice was falling apart.

The fire roasted artichoke (ask for a side of Balsamic) and the Avocado Egg Rolls.   Pretty happy with my entrees but the menu has too many options to find ol faithfuls so it takes a long time to settle on an order.  Yesterday i just ordered Apps and small plates--the fontina stuffed mushrooms are amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater

Ming K.,"Whitehouse Station, Readington Township, NJ",1,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,"On 1/5/2018 Friday night 8:55 p.m. my wife, daughter, and I went to the Bridgewater branch Cheesecake Factory for dinner. We were told there was a 30 minutes wait, and was handed a pager by the host. We were sitting on the bench waiting, and after 30 minutes I went to the front desk to check on the status. I was told by a different host that input into their system was actually a 40 min wait. I told her that when we received the pager, we were quoted a 30 minutes wait. After checking their system again, I was told that they are cleaning our table, and we will be next. After about 5 minutes, a group of three people that had received a pager after us got seated. A few minutes later another group of four got seated. After waiting for 40 minutes we were still not seated. A few minutes later another group of four people who came in and received a pager 15 minutes after us got seated. I happened to look at my watch when they sat down next to me on the bench. My daughter said she saw a group of two people who came in about 20 min after us get seated. During out wait I also saw a group of 6 get seated. I understand a group of 2 and group of 6 are seated at different tables than groups of 3 or 4. But still, a total of of 5 groups of people who received pagers after us got seated before us. I made another complaint to a woman that just showed up at the front desk. She took the pager, which never lit up, from my daughter. Instead of apologizing to me, I was told you're not the only customer here. While I was complaining, another girl took my daughter and wife to the table without even letting me know. After we were seated, I asked for the manager. The manager was the same women who took our pager. I was told later her name is Sara Solomon. I told her that I was not happy with the situation. She said they made a mistake. I asked her where is the apology. She unwillingly apologized and repeatedly said she couldn't have done anything about it. My wife told her that she mismanaged the restaurant and asked her what is the point of using the pager if you can not manage it properly. She immediately responded again with you are not the only customer here. Immediately I stood up and left the restaurant. She was basically telling me that they don't want my business. I have been a Cheesecake Factory customer for over 20 years. The first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory was in Atlanta. I was very impressed by their customer service and food. I used to go to the Edison NJ branch before the Bridgewater branch open.

Firstly, I have dined at several Cheesecake Factories throughout the country and i am aware they are usually full and you have to wait until a table is available. Therefore I think more seating should be available. Secondly, the waiting staff seemed very frazzled and rushed, they need to be more organized so as not to project their anxiety onto patronizers. Lastly, I ordered 3 types of cheesecake all of which were unsatisfactory. The quality of cheesecakes the Cheesecake Factory now produced tastes artificial and unappetizing.

We're seated within 3 minutes of checking in. Great! Table contained remnants of the last diner's meal. Not so great. Asked the waiter to get someone to clean it up. He came back to take drink orders but didn't acknowledge the dirty table. When he brought the drinks we asked again. His answer was to grab my napkin and brush off the lettuce, crumbs etc off the table. Directly INTO MY LAP! Really? Not off to a good start. So we place an order for a few apps and a pizza. Pizza comes out. Really tasty. Hubby needs an iced tea refill. No one notices. First app comes out. Still no refill. Hubby asks a server passing by to refill for him which happens right away. Second app comes out. No one has bothered to check on us yet. Third app comes out. Need another refill but the server is STILL IGNORING US. He kept walking right by to help other people but NEVER BOTHERED to check on us or refill hubby's drink. NOT GOOD. HUBBY is MAAAAD. So we call over the manager who of course apologized. Profusely. Repeatedly. Such a nice man named Dan. Made things SO RIGHT and with such hospitality that I am giving them 4 stars instead of my original thought of 1.

Chris L.,"Morristown, NJ",540,859,4662,3.0,11/29/2013,"The workers in this factory all wear white .. when we visited on black Friday evening it was like a Henry Ford assembly line humming at top speed and efficiency, no sarcasm they were cranking!  I think every table was full and yet our waiter was still friendly and helpful, and the kitchen made our food perfectly and quickly. You can only admire a machine that rakes in cash this smoothly because it ain't cheap to eat here. The (free!) bread basket that comes first has both white and dark baguettes, one loaf sorta had failed to rise (oops) but the next was perfect, served warm with butter, pretty hard to resist.  And the soda and water glasses here are easily 24 ounces, overwhelming! The menu is similarly overwhelming, it's a book that goes on for 20 some pages, but about half those pages are advertisements, super annoying.  A small house salad arrived perfectly tossed with bleu cheese dressing, it was generous with the fancy greens and actually had reasonably ripe tomato, lucky for November, yummy, not ridiculous at $4.50. Four-cheese pasta was small tubes of pasta in a mild tomato sauce and generously cheesed with mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan and one more.  Totally kid friendly of course but I wouldn't call it bland, it was quite good just in a mild flavored kind of way.  But not cheap at $14.50. Big thumbs up for the Jamaican pepper shrimp entree, this was about a dozen small shrimp in a deeply spiced dark sauce obviously made with fresh peppers, plus a pile of mildly spicy black beans, brown rice, mango salsa and fried plantains.  I flat out never expected something so delicious from a chain that calls itself a factory LOL but it was a solid medium on my spice scale, very well done and enough food to share among two.  Pricey at $18 but it made the meal for me. A notable downside is that the Cheesecake Factory takes no reservations, they won't even put your name on a call-ahead list.  You hope, but mostly you wait. There's a big bar that doesn't seem to fill up, I guess because kids can't sit at the bar haha, but you might keep it in mind if you need to get away from the xma$ music in Bridgewater mall. Special offer Nov 2013 - buy a $25 gift card now, and get a free slice of cheesecake in January 2014.  Yeah I know, delayed gratification is tough :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=60

It was my friends birthday so a group of us decided to meet for an early lunch. I was happy because we were seated in 10 minutes which is a record for this place. No matter which Cheesecake Factory you choose there is always and I mean always a wait. They do not take reservations. Once seated my waitress came right over and took our drink order. I really love their unsweetened passion fruit ice tea. It reminds me of being in the tropics. I ordered the fish tacos which were made with fresh cod. They gave me four nice size tacos and black beans and rice .  I got mine the original way battered and fried . It was very tasty. One of my friends asked our waitress if she could get hers grilled b/c she has a gluten problem.  The Cheesecake Factory was happy to oblige. She too thought her tacos were delicious . One of my friends got the flatbread with pears and blue cheese topped with arugula, pecans, and caramelized onions. She loved it.  For dessert I split the Dutch Apple Carmel Streusel Cheesecake. It was amazing with layers of sliced apples and Carmel btw cheesecake. It was like eating an apple pie and cheesecake and streusel all in one. Of course it came with loads of whipped cream. My friend ordered the gluten free chocolate Godiva flour less cheesecake. It was her birthday so they decorated her plate and spelled out happy birthday. It was a lovely ending to a delicious lunch.

I love coming here because it makes me feel like a kid again and I can get anything I desire because they have everything (dessert, salad, steak, finger foods, etc) I want! To start, we ordered the Crab Cake Bites. These are what Mini Crab Cakes are supposed to be like. They are basically a fried lump of crab meat, held together with a filler. Served and paired with Hollandaise Aioli. I like them cause it's better than eating a whole crab. It'll save your fingers and time. Then our Cuban Spring Rolls came to the table. It tasted like a Cuban sandwich rolled up in a crispy tortilla and deep fried for enhanced taste and texture. It's so meaty and so cheeeesy. So good! We also had the tantalizing Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer made from fresh ahi, tuna, avocado, cucumbers and fried wonton chips. So fresh and so good, and it will impress any seafood lover. Our last appetizer was the Corn Dog. They're a-okay. I don't understand why the dudes love this Corn Dog. I wonder what's the obsession about? Please do tell. Our entree was the Meatloaf with gravy. Not fancy, just comforting and fulfilling. Simply delicious! Main course was the Bacon Bacon Burger. Guilty guilty guilty. We ate like kings today. The food were AWESOME! We were debating which cheesecake is the best so we ordered two to try and yes it was difficult to make a choice... We agreed that the Blueberry was the best... sultry sweet and creamy... until the Godiva Cheesecake came along. Can someone tell me who invented that delicious Godiva Cheesecake? I don't know, and I don't care. All I do know is, it tasted so good! I'm addicted, absolutely, definitely and 100% in love with their cheesecakes.

Instead, Dominick Rossi, the bakery manager stepped in and took me to a different register to let the line continue. He was gracious, kind, patient and understanding. Instead of feeling like I'd created so much extra work, under pressure, he made me feel like my business was truly appreciated! I left feeling like I had made a friend.

Cheesecake Factory is great for its large menu with broad appeal for whatever a person is in the mood for. In my case, their menu clearly marks items that can be made gluten free by request. This makes the dining experience much easier for me. For lunch, I've had their burgers with the gluten free buns and they weren't bad. For dessert, they have a gluten free cheesecake that is made with Godiva chocolate. With my dietary restrictions dessert opportunities are far and few between, so I typically have one when the option is available ""because I can."" The seating is comfortable, but the service was very slow - especially when I was hoping for a business lunch that was reasonably modest in time.

Laura P.,"New York, NY",846,391,238,4.0,8/21/2012,"Cheesecake Factories are a popular place, so it's never surprising to me that the wait on any given day at any given hour is, at a minimum, twenty minutes. However, surprisingly enough, my last visit to a Cheesecake Factory, with my family on a Sunday around 12:30PM, did not come with a wait and we were seated immediately. The menu is overwhelming, especially for people who have never been to a Cheesecake Factory. Two of the people I was with had never had it before and found it hard to choose just one thing to order. Our waiter was very friendly and suggested some of his favorite dishes. Clad in the classic Cheesecake Factory white outfit, our waiter was a young guy with spunk, very eager to take our orders and bring us our food. I traditionally get an appetizer as a meal because of how daunting I find the rest of the menu, as well as the portions of the regular size entrees. I got the cheeseburger sliders and a ""small plate"" of cheese quesadillas. We ordered the customary fried macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer to share, which absolutely blew the minds of the two who had never had them before. The mac and cheese balls are really one of the best foods to get at a Cheesecake Factory, or pretty much an restaurant.  And of course I got the raspberry lemonade, complete with crushed sugar around the rim of the big glass. I absolutely adore this drink from the Cheesecake Factory and find pure joy in the very existence of it.  The decor of this Cheesecake Factory was nice, as they all are. I think it could be classified as Grecian decor? Or European in general? I'll get back to you on that.  We were celebrating a birthday during this particular visit, and about six waiters sang ""Happy Birthday"" and brought a slice of chocolate cake with a birthday candle to the birthday boy. The cake was incredible and was surrounded on its plate with homemade whipped cream. A+ in my book. No matter how long you have to wait to be seated at a Cheesecake Factory, it is always worth the wait. I waited two and a half hours on Valentine's Day with a big group of friends and dates and we all decided by the time we were seated at 10:30PM that it was well, well worth the wait. This experience at this Cheesecake Factory was no different, even though we didn't have to wait at all for the always amazing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=100

Also haven't really heard anyone with a real bad comment about its food. Apart from the food, they also have a bar and a great ambience/interior decoration which is consistent throughout all their restaurants. While their dessert (Cheesecake) is what they are known for, their appetizers and entrees are also a delight. My favorite at the restaurant is the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo (Shrimp, Chicken, Andouille Sausage, Tomatoes, Peppers, Onions and Garlic Simmered in a Spicy Cajun Style Broth with Cream. Topped with Steamed White Rice). An appetizer I tried this time was the Tex Mex Eggrolls (Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese served with Sour Cream and Salsa).

The black beans and the rice was phenomenal it was so yummy but it was like on the side. they gave you four fish tacos and those tacos were literally the size of my hand. over all I would recommended it for people who like large portions of food. it's definitely not something  for food adventurists.

That NEVER happens at any Cheesecake Factory, so I had super high hopes for the rest of my visit.  But it was pretty much all downhill from there. We waited 35 minutes before someone even came to talk to us. I would've been more understanding, but besides a few people at the bar, we were in an otherwise empty restaurant.  We waited extraordinarily long periods of time between getting water, ordering drinks and then having our order taken. We tried to do it all at once after our server's long disappearance but she kept telling us she'd come back and take our order later. We also never got that super wonderful basket of bread that you usually get (we asked for it after we realized that it wasn't coming)... People should know better than to deprive a girl of her sweet, sweet carbohydrates!!! After our food came out we never saw our original server again. We had to flag someone down and ask for our check. Someone else finally came over and he was pretty awesome! He apologized profusely after we explained our situation to him and he was super quick in getting us boxes for our food, a slice of cheesecake to go and our check.

By the time our server came back to check on us, I had already eaten about half of it. Was I supposed to sit around staring at it while it got cold? Told her about the onions. She apologized but then the only remedy was I had to wait another 5-10 min for her to come back with a bowl of caramelized onions that I could add to my now-cold half of a burger. Uh, thanks???? was not even offered a free dessert or anything. Took her forever to get the check to us and she didn't even give me a pen for me to sign it with. Had to use my own from my purse.

Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,859,26,3.0,10/21/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory but I've gotta knock this place down a star due to some recent experiences.  Let me be completely clear - I love the food at CF and think they are one of, if not, the best chain restaurant.  The food quality is so far above the other chains it's comical.  Everything I've ever had here has been awesome.  The apps are great - love the Buffalo blasts, Ahi Tartare and everything else I've tried.  Salads are seriously the best I've ever had and they make very good sandwiches and burgers.  Very good fish tacos, as well.  Whatever you get, you will like and the portions are enormous.   The place is an absolute mad house (almost always) - mostly because it's located right in the heart of the busy Bridgewater mall.  But, that's not why I'm knocking it down a star.  You almost always have to wait at least 20-25 minutes for a table, but you can always enjoy a drink at the bar.  Be warned though - the drink prices are borderline rip offs.  It's about $8 for a beer which is a little silly.  My wife and I typically try and grab a table by in the bar section to eat since they are first come, first serve. The reason I'm knocking this place down a star is that the service has been so miss recently.  We've had incomplete orders, very long wait times for the food and some pretty bad overall service.  It's definitely a slight change for this place because they never used to be like this.  I actually ordered the same salad on my last 2 visits and they forgot the exact same ingredient both times.  Without me even saying anything, the food runner noticed they had forgotten it and said he would bring it out to me.  I never saw him again.  Oh well.   I think you'll always like the food at this place, but it really has turned into quite an adventure.  I'm still going to continue to come, but I might have to temper my expectations.  I am super happy because it is Fall again and they do have Pumpkin Cheesecake back.  It's amazing.  Every piece of cheesecake I have tried here has always been great.  It's one of the best ways that you can end a meal and you can also easily get it to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=140

Mark H.,"Secaucus, NJ",55,50,18,4.0,4/21/2014,"I never understood why people always raved about CCF, the previous two times I had dined there, the food was nothing special but always accompanied with a long wait. When my wife and mother-in-law wanted to go there for Easter dinner I was reluctant.   I had never been to this specific CCF before, so I decided to ""go with the flow"" and agreed. We waited for a table about 1/2 hour but considering it was Easter, I guess that's not all that bad. We were greeted by our waiter almost immediately upon being seated. He was such a nice, extremely personal guy and had a really great attitude especially considering that he was working on Easter Sunday. We ordered our drinks and he offed to bring some bread to our table. I had a Margarita on the rocks w/ salt. It was so so...a bit sour for my taste. Since it WAS Easter I decided to treat myself and I ordered the fillet Mignon. Wow, what a difference from my other visits. I guess that was the right thing to order because it was probably top 10 pieces of meat I've ever ordered. It was cooked perfectly and really had a great taste to it. It was salty which I like. Right up there with some of the better steakhouses I've ate at. I'm not a big dessert person so i didn't have any cake but my wife did and I guess she liked it because it was gone in less than 5. Coffee was alright...like the clear mugs. I'd like to bring up our server again because he really was good at what he does...I wish I remembered his name so I could give him credit. But he had dark curly hair and dark rimmed glasses and a soft voice. Not only was he friendly, but he also knew the menu very well and effectively described the items in question. He also made suggestions and went out of the way to make sure we were taken care of. A server of this caliber you usually don't see at a chain restaurant. The business should consider themselves luck to have such a great employee.  $125 for the 3 of us with 2 drinks each and fillet...not bad for Easter Sunday.

My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken, which you could see was chicken fingers just dipped in sauce. I ordered the Renee special for lunch which comes with a soup (broccoli cheese) which was like mushy baby food. The chicken salad sandwich was okay but I had to take off the bread because I felt like it was doused in butter and it was pretty intense.

The manager came over without me asking and he was very nice and sympathetic, apologized,  and offer to wrap it up to go on the house.

Abby B.,"East Meadow, NY",24,244,5,1.0,9/2/2010,"The good: beautiful restaurant and stellar wait service.   The bad: everything else It's bad enough that CF is notoriously un-veg-friendly (black beans cooked in beef broth, vegetable stir-fry cooked in oyster sauce, egg in just about everything: bread, pasta, avocado rolls, salad dressing), but I was still surprised by how badly my veggie meal was appropriated by an establishment who manages to prepare a veritable novel's worth of meals to perfection. I started with the edamame, which was served with bits of spaghetti mixed in, presumably from the shared boiling water.  Besides being tacky, since most of the pastas have an egg-base, I was not amused.  In addition, besides being grossly overcooked, the edamame were slick with what I hope was oil, but fear may have been butter... and the requisite sea salt was absent. Next I tried the white bean hummus.  A vegan dish by design, I was startled by the taste of cheese when I took my first bite.  A closer inspection determined the culprit; why would you melt cheese shreds onto the flatbread without a mention?  Finally, I ordered the fresh vegetable salad, minus the egg-laden pomegranate vinaigrette dressing.  I also omitted the cheese and the apples, subbing avocado.  I was charged $1 for the addition of the avocado, but strangely was not credited for the deduction of the other ingredients.  I do not like being nickel & dimed-- especially when it only goes in one direction. Can't The Cheesecake Factory take a cue from other large chains and at least indicate allergens on their menu, at most become significantly more friendly to vegetarians and vegans?

Everyone working there is friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is very relaxed with it's muted lights and colours. Although there are some seats that are close to each other.

This new location in NJ just opened a few months ago and I went midweek after shopping at the mall. Service from the greeting to the byes was excellent. The very friendly and attentive waitress said weekends are very busy but weekdays offer little or no wait.The menu choices were great and I settled on a $9.99 lunch special that included delicious slightly spicy mexican chicken and rice soup, large salad, and half turkey sandwich on whole grain baguette. Everything was delicious, especially the soup which changes everyday. Also noted that the turkey was fresh turkey breast meat, not processed. Very full and satisfied, I couldn't leave without checking out the bakery and I will have definitely have to come back as I work my way through every dessert choice.

The standard at this chain is better than any other american themed restaurant.  We had the chicken samosas and loaded baked potato tots for appetizers, the samosas were small but good and the tots were simple great, they had bacon and cheese ... do I need to say more.  For lunch we had the Thai coconut-lime chicken and lemon garlic.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp and I was blown away with the Thai coconut-lime chicken.  Definitely a repeat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=20

For my lunch order, I had the Baja chicken tacos.  There was 4 decent size tacos that were filled with ""spicy"" chicken, cheese, tomato, avocado, onion, chipotle, and cilantro.  There was a little too much going on with all the toppings on this taco, but the taste was still acceptable.  There was also a side of rice and beans, which were solid.

This Cheesecake factory gets packed! We came on a random Tuesday night for 6:30 pm but did not get seated until 7:00 p.m. That is not that bad of a wait especially since you can go to the mall while you wait. The service was really great. Our waitress was exceptionally nice. They offer you bread to your table which is a nice bonus. Cheesecake factory also has a ""healthier"" menu that I thought was nice. I ordered an Asian salad that was very good. My friend ordered a flatbread that she enjoyed. Altogether, I think Cheesecake factory has a huge menu so everyone in your party will have something that they will enjoy. The service was good and the food came out quickly.

I loved the decor, very large but inviting. There was a wait of about 10 minutes for a 2 top and so we made our way to the bar to wait.  I ordered one of their new signature cocktails; cucumber mojito - it was very good and I appreciated the bar tender letting me know it was gin and not rum before making it for me.  I prefer gin, but it was nice he thought to ask.  We were buzzed and got our table. It took a bit for our waiter to show up and when he did he looked at our table and said ""oh, you got drinks already, I'll get some bread"" and walked away.  That was it! No hi, no do you have questions on the menu, have you been here before, welcome - nothing and then he was gone - for a good ten minutes! He came back and just seemed like he was bothered to even wait on us - had a bit of an attitude.  Asked for our order, we order the chicken pot stickers to share, I got the catfish and my husband got a combo of Steak Diane and shrimp.  He repeated the orders and my husband asked for a glass of the house cab as well - that seemed to throw him off.  He asked ""you want it now?"" Yes, yes he did. lol  He then repeated our order and left. The glass of wine and our appetizer was delivered by a runner.   The pot stickers were ok.  We love potstickers and I thought I would really like them, but the chicken was a bit heavy for the light potsticker shell and fell out on every bit and seemed thick and mushy.  The soy was good, over all, I wouldn't order them again, but they weren't terrible. Our meals came and the waiter again seemed pissed off to be there - the placed the dishes in front of us and I had to act quickly as he turned to ask if I could have some extra lemon - he had already turned and was walking away! No asking if we needed anything else, no words, nothing, *slam, here's your plates, goodbye*. He brought back a small cup of lemon slices for me but literally kind of slid it onto the table as he walked by.  My husband looked at me and said ""guess he's in a mad rush for the next tip he won't get"". The catfish was good, not great, but good.  The mashed potatoes were heavy and dry.  The green beans were so far overcooked they were shriveled up bits of blackened green on my plate.  I ate one, pushed them aside.  The country corn was nice, with a bacon-y flavor with a huge amount of corn silk in it. My husband ate his with little comment, he was hungry, but afterwards said it was just *ok*.   We thought to possible get some cheesecake, after all, that is the name of the place. Someone came and took our plates, and the next thing we know, our waiter is there with words! lol  He says ""want anything else?"" Wow.  What a salesman! My husband then says ""no, I think we'll pick up someone on the way out to go"".  He walks away, and comes back five minutes later to do his slide and run again, this time with the check. By that time I had my coat and and just wanted to leave - ever feel like you're not welcome some place? Yeah, that was the feeling.  We won't be back.  What a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=20

No McDonalds, Burger King greasy food. Well good thing The Cheesecake Factory is open until 12:30 PM.  There was a 50 minute waiting for a table, but it didn't take that long. It was only about 20-25 minute wait.  I liked where we were seated. Table of 3, we got seated where a table of 6-8 people would be seated in.  We ordered the Factory Nachos (Crisp Tortilla Chips Covered with Melted Cheeses, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Jalapeños and Salsa.) It's probably the best kind of Nachos I have had. To me it is all about the chips. The chips is different from any typical nachos. To me it is a lot more tastier. Works very well with the condiments.  Next came the Stuffed Mushrooms (Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce.) I love mushrooms. Good flavor. Cheesy and the sauce was excellent.  My entree was the Mushroom Burger (Lots of Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Mayo, Covered with Melted Swiss and Fontina Cheese.) Definitely tons of mushroom. My burger was cooked nice and pink. A juicy and flavorful burger. Almost a bit messy.  My dessert was the Original Cheesecake. Mmmm... Love the cheesecake. Smooth, rich, creamy and light. Must save room for a cheesecake.  Our waiter Carlos M. was an excellent waiter. He was very accommodating, quick with service, conversational, friendly, and nice.

I ordered the Avocado Toast for my main course and it was much larger than I thought; it was more of an avocado baguette. Very filling- i took half of it home. My family ordered the Mac & Cheese Burger, Truffle Grilled Cheese Sticks and a Salad. Everyone was happy with their food; it was al great quality and big portions.

My order was ready when I got there and customer service was great but I did find that the cheesecake at this location taste it different than others I have been to. Some of the cheesecake slices that I picked up we're also very tiny and cut smaller than usual. All in all the cheesecake was great but I think I prefer other locations better.  I had ordered the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate tasted a little different I'm wondering whether it was sitting out for over a day or if it was actually made differently I'm not sure if the cheesecakes are just shipped to the store directly so perhaps it was just old. I also picked up an Adams peanut butter cheesecake and the slice was almost half the size of the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake. It was sliced thinly and the end of the slice was falling apart.

Ming K.,"Whitehouse Station, Readington Township, United States",1,1,,1.0,8/1/2018,"On 1/5/2018 Friday night 8:55 p.m. my wife, daughter, and I went to the Bridgewater branch Cheesecake Factory for dinner. We were told there was a 30 minutes wait, and was handed a pager by the host. We were sitting on the bench waiting, and after 30 minutes I went to the front desk to check on the status. I was told by a different host that input into their system was actually a 40 min wait. I told her that when we received the pager, we were quoted a 30 minutes wait. After checking their system again, I was told that they are cleaning our table, and we will be next. After about 5 minutes, a group of three people that had received a pager after us got seated. A few minutes later another group of four got seated. After waiting for 40 minutes we were still not seated. A few minutes later another group of four people who came in and received a pager 15 minutes after us got seated. I happened to look at my watch when they sat down next to me on the bench. My daughter said she saw a group of two people who came in about 20 min after us get seated. During out wait I also saw a group of 6 get seated. I understand a group of 2 and group of 6 are seated at different tables than groups of 3 or 4. But still, a total of of 5 groups of people who received pagers after us got seated before us. I made another complaint to a woman that just showed up at the front desk. She took the pager, which never lit up, from my daughter. Instead of apologizing to me, I was told you're not the only customer here. While I was complaining, another girl took my daughter and wife to the table without even letting me know. After we were seated, I asked for the manager. The manager was the same women who took our pager. I was told later her name is Sara Solomon. I told her that I was not happy with the situation. She said they made a mistake. I asked her where is the apology. She unwillingly apologized and repeatedly said she couldn't have done anything about it. My wife told her that she mismanaged the restaurant and asked her what is the point of using the pager if you can not manage it properly. She immediately responded again with you are not the only customer here. Immediately I stood up and left the restaurant. She was basically telling me that they don't want my business. I have been a Cheesecake Factory customer for over 20 years. The first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory was in Atlanta. I was very impressed by their customer service and food. I used to go to the Edison NJ branch before the Bridgewater branch open. I will not go back to Cheesecake Factory again unless they send me an apology letter or email.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater

Therefore I think more seating should be available. Secondly, the waiting staff seemed very frazzled and rushed, they need to be more organized so as not to project their anxiety onto patronizers.

We're seated within 3 minutes of checking in. Great! Table contained remnants of the last diner's meal. Not so great. Asked the waiter to get someone to clean it up. He came back to take drink orders but didn't acknowledge the dirty table. When he brought the drinks we asked again. His answer was to grab my napkin and brush off the lettuce, crumbs etc off the table. Directly INTO MY LAP! Really? Not off to a good start. So we place an order for a few apps and a pizza. Pizza comes out. Really tasty. Hubby needs an iced tea refill. No one notices. First app comes out. Still no refill. Hubby asks a server passing by to refill for him which happens right away. Second app comes out. No one has bothered to check on us yet. Third app comes out. Need another refill but the server is STILL IGNORING US. He kept walking right by to help other people but NEVER BOTHERED to check on us or refill hubby's drink. NOT GOOD. HUBBY is MAAAAD. So we call over the manager who of course apologized. Profusely. Repeatedly. Such a nice man named Dan. Made things SO RIGHT and with such hospitality that I am giving them 4 stars instead of my original thought of 1.

As someone with nut allergies I'll reiterate that is extremely scary and as a chain restaurant I don't understand how they leave themselves so liable for a lawsuit. I don't know if it's the chef's not following the menu or if it's a chain-wide error.  Recently went here with my bf after having a sadly disappointing dinner at Shake Shack for some post-dinner drinks and dessert. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and decided to split a slice of the blackout cake a la mode. The menu states that this finished with almonds. Our cake definitely came with walnuts. Not okay.

I loved the decor, very large but inviting. There was a wait of about 10 minutes for a 2 top and so we made our way to the bar to wait.  I ordered one of their new signature cocktails; cucumber mojito - it was very good and I appreciated the bar tender letting me know it was gin and not rum before making it for me.  I prefer gin, but it was nice he thought to ask.  We were buzzed and got our table. It took a bit for our waiter to show up and when he did he looked at our table and said ""oh, you got drinks already, I'll get some bread"" and walked away.  That was it! No hi, no do you have questions on the menu, have you been here before, welcome - nothing and then he was gone - for a good ten minutes! He came back and just seemed like he was bothered to even wait on us - had a bit of an attitude.  Asked for our order, we order the chicken pot stickers to share, I got the catfish and my husband got a combo of Steak Diane and shrimp.  He repeated the orders and my husband asked for a glass of the house cab as well - that seemed to throw him off.  He asked ""you want it now?"" Yes, yes he did. lol  He then repeated our order and left. The glass of wine and our appetizer was delivered by a runner.   The pot stickers were ok.  We love potstickers and I thought I would really like them, but the chicken was a bit heavy for the light potsticker shell and fell out on every bit and seemed thick and mushy.  The soy was good, over all, I wouldn't order them again, but they weren't terrible. Our meals came and the waiter again seemed pissed off to be there - the placed the dishes in front of us and I had to act quickly as he turned to ask if I could have some extra lemon - he had already turned and was walking away! No asking if we needed anything else, no words, nothing, *slam, here's your plates, goodbye*. He brought back a small cup of lemon slices for me but literally kind of slid it onto the table as he walked by.  My husband looked at me and said ""guess he's in a mad rush for the next tip he won't get"". The catfish was good, not great, but good.  The mashed potatoes were heavy and dry.  The green beans were so far overcooked they were shriveled up bits of blackened green on my plate.  I ate one, pushed them aside.  The country corn was nice, with a bacon-y flavor with a huge amount of corn silk in it. My husband ate his with little comment, he was hungry, but afterwards said it was just *ok*.   We thought to possible get some cheesecake, after all, that is the name of the place. Someone came and took our plates, and the next thing we know, our waiter is there with words! lol  He says ""want anything else?"" Wow.  What a salesman! My husband then says ""no, I think we'll pick up someone on the way out to go"".  He walks away, and comes back five minutes later to do his slide and run again, this time with the check. By that time I had my coat and and just wanted to leave - ever feel like you're not welcome some place? Yeah, that was the feeling.  We won't be back.  What a shame.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=20

Alan L.,"Brooklyn, United States",217,656,3336,4.0,28/1/2015,"Finding something to eat around 10 PM in the Bridgewater/Somerville can be very difficult, especially if you what something decent. No McDonalds, Burger King greasy food. Well good thing The Cheesecake Factory is open until 12:30 PM.  There was a 50 minute waiting for a table, but it didn't take that long. It was only about 20-25 minute wait.  I liked where we were seated. Table of 3, we got seated where a table of 6-8 people would be seated in.  We ordered the Factory Nachos (Crisp Tortilla Chips Covered with Melted Cheeses, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Jalapeños and Salsa.) It's probably the best kind of Nachos I have had. To me it is all about the chips. The chips is different from any typical nachos. To me it is a lot more tastier. Works very well with the condiments.  Next came the Stuffed Mushrooms (Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce.) I love mushrooms. Good flavor. Cheesy and the sauce was excellent.  My entree was the Mushroom Burger (Lots of Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Mayo, Covered with Melted Swiss and Fontina Cheese.) Definitely tons of mushroom. My burger was cooked nice and pink. A juicy and flavorful burger. Almost a bit messy.  My dessert was the Original Cheesecake. Mmmm... Love the cheesecake. Smooth, rich, creamy and light. Must save room for a cheesecake.  Our waiter Carlos M. was an excellent waiter. He was very accommodating, quick with service, conversational, friendly, and nice.  My friends and I kept talking about how the service was just spot on.  Fattening meal...yes it was.

Chris L.,"Morristown, United States",540,859,4662,3.0,29/11/2013,"The workers in this factory all wear white .. when we visited on black Friday evening it was like a Henry Ford assembly line humming at top speed and efficiency, no sarcasm they were cranking!  I think every table was full and yet our waiter was still friendly and helpful, and the kitchen made our food perfectly and quickly. You can only admire a machine that rakes in cash this smoothly because it ain't cheap to eat here. The (free!) bread basket that comes first has both white and dark baguettes, one loaf sorta had failed to rise (oops) but the next was perfect, served warm with butter, pretty hard to resist.  And the soda and water glasses here are easily 24 ounces, overwhelming! The menu is similarly overwhelming, it's a book that goes on for 20 some pages, but about half those pages are advertisements, super annoying.  A small house salad arrived perfectly tossed with bleu cheese dressing, it was generous with the fancy greens and actually had reasonably ripe tomato, lucky for November, yummy, not ridiculous at $4.50. Four-cheese pasta was small tubes of pasta in a mild tomato sauce and generously cheesed with mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan and one more.  Totally kid friendly of course but I wouldn't call it bland, it was quite good just in a mild flavored kind of way.  But not cheap at $14.50. Big thumbs up for the Jamaican pepper shrimp entree, this was about a dozen small shrimp in a deeply spiced dark sauce obviously made with fresh peppers, plus a pile of mildly spicy black beans, brown rice, mango salsa and fried plantains.  I flat out never expected something so delicious from a chain that calls itself a factory LOL but it was a solid medium on my spice scale, very well done and enough food to share among two.  Pricey at $18 but it made the meal for me. A notable downside is that the Cheesecake Factory takes no reservations, they won't even put your name on a call-ahead list.  You hope, but mostly you wait. There's a big bar that doesn't seem to fill up, I guess because kids can't sit at the bar haha, but you might keep it in mind if you need to get away from the xma$ music in Bridgewater mall. Special offer Nov 2013 - buy a $25 gift card now, and get a free slice of cheesecake in January 2014.  Yeah I know, delayed gratification is tough :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=60

Donna R.,"Warren, United States",466,419,4091,4.0,17/1/2015,"I've been a regular at the Cheesecake  Factory in Boca Raton, Fla. I wanted to try this one in Bridgewater . It was my friends birthday so a group of us decided to meet for an early lunch. I was happy because we were seated in 10 minutes which is a record for this place. No matter which Cheesecake Factory you choose there is always and I mean always a wait. They do not take reservations. Once seated my waitress came right over and took our drink order. I really love their unsweetened passion fruit ice tea. It reminds me of being in the tropics. I ordered the fish tacos which were made with fresh cod. They gave me four nice size tacos and black beans and rice .  I got mine the original way battered and fried . It was very tasty. One of my friends asked our waitress if she could get hers grilled b/c she has a gluten problem.  The Cheesecake Factory was happy to oblige. She too thought her tacos were delicious . One of my friends got the flatbread with pears and blue cheese topped with arugula, pecans, and caramelized onions. She loved it.  For dessert I split the Dutch Apple Carmel Streusel Cheesecake. It was amazing with layers of sliced apples and Carmel btw cheesecake. It was like eating an apple pie and cheesecake and streusel all in one. Of course it came with loads of whipped cream. My friend ordered the gluten free chocolate Godiva flour less cheesecake. It was her birthday so they decorated her plate and spelled out happy birthday. It was a lovely ending to a delicious lunch. I will say the food is very good but this place is very pricey. If u come bring lots of money.

They were good.  Not as good or plentiful as Maggianos across the parking lot, but good.  Then we ordered the chopped salads with chicken. Citrus Honey dressing on the side (I find their house balsamic wayyy to oniony).  My salad was missing the tomatoes, both of our we're missing the avocado and we had to search for signs of chicken.  We also had to ask for more dressing because they brought out so little.   Service was great.  Once we got the salads together, they were great, albeit hardly any tiny chicken pieces, but a lot of greens.  We ordered dessert to go.  The Cheesecake Factory, how can you not? My friend had the Carrot Cake.  Only ate half.  Didn't think it was good.  I had the Fudgy Chocolate Cake w whipped cream on the side.  Fresh whipped cream was great.  The cake was moist, fresh, delicious.  BUT, a thin piece.  Thinnest slice of cake I've ever gotten anywhere.

I love coming here because it makes me feel like a kid again and I can get anything I desire because they have everything (dessert, salad, steak, finger foods, etc) I want! To start, we ordered the Crab Cake Bites. These are what Mini Crab Cakes are supposed to be like. They are basically a fried lump of crab meat, held together with a filler. Served and paired with Hollandaise Aioli. I like them cause it's better than eating a whole crab. It'll save your fingers and time. Then our Cuban Spring Rolls came to the table. It tasted like a Cuban sandwich rolled up in a crispy tortilla and deep fried for enhanced taste and texture. It's so meaty and so cheeeesy. So good! We also had the tantalizing Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer made from fresh ahi, tuna, avocado, cucumbers and fried wonton chips. So fresh and so good, and it will impress any seafood lover. Our last appetizer was the Corn Dog. They're a-okay. I don't understand why the dudes love this Corn Dog. I wonder what's the obsession about? Please do tell. Our entree was the Meatloaf with gravy. Not fancy, just comforting and fulfilling. Simply delicious! Main course was the Bacon Bacon Burger. Guilty guilty guilty. We ate like kings today. The food were AWESOME! We were debating which cheesecake is the best so we ordered two to try and yes it was difficult to make a choice... We agreed that the Blueberry was the best... sultry sweet and creamy... until the Godiva Cheesecake came along. Can someone tell me who invented that delicious Godiva Cheesecake? I don't know, and I don't care. All I do know is, it tasted so good! I'm addicted, absolutely, definitely and 100% in love with their cheesecakes.

However it took 20 minutes for the keg to be replaced and when it was finally changed, the bar tender continued pouring the beer into my now warm glass with the warm bottom of the keg beer.  We then were told we had to wait another 20 to 30 minutes because the manager opened the outdoor patio. It has been cold, raining and misty all day.

Instead, Dominick Rossi, the bakery manager stepped in and took me to a different register to let the line continue. He was gracious, kind, patient and understanding. Instead of feeling like I'd created so much extra work, under pressure, he made me feel like my business was truly appreciated! I left feeling like I had made a friend.

Cheesecake Factory is great for its large menu with broad appeal for whatever a person is in the mood for. In my case, their menu clearly marks items that can be made gluten free by request. This makes the dining experience much easier for me. For lunch, I've had their burgers with the gluten free buns and they weren't bad. For dessert, they have a gluten free cheesecake that is made with Godiva chocolate. With my dietary restrictions dessert opportunities are far and few between, so I typically have one when the option is available ""because I can."" The seating is comfortable, but the service was very slow - especially when I was hoping for a business lunch that was reasonably modest in time. No doubt, Cheesecake Factory is a good restaurant with a lot of options, not to forget the cheesecake.

A couple of times when we came back inside to ask if our table was almost available or double check if the buzzer would reach to where we were standing outside, we received very rude answers. When our buzzer finally buzzed, we rushed inside and handed the buzzer to the hostess. We stood at the counter for another 10 minutes before we were finally seated by another ice-cold hostess.  When we were finally seated, we received no napkins. We politely pointed this out, and the waitress brought us our napkins. 20 minutes after we had ordered, we were the only table without bread.

I needed a highchair for him, but they WOULD NOT provide me with one if I wanted to bring the stroller (very compact in a restaurant that was 15% full max) in with me.

I asked the hostess (short girl with black hair probably Hispanic), how long for a family of 5, she said about 25 mins. We sat to wait, but time went by and other people coming in after us were being seated. 1 hour passed by and a family of 4 came in and was seated immediately but we were still waiting for over 1 hour. I stood up to ask why we hadn't been seated and a few families similar to ours had been. There was now a 2nd hostess with curly black or brown hair which very rude told me a table for 4 is not the same as a table for 5. I understand that but there was no need for very rude attitude she gave me. When we were finally called to be seated she gave my daughter a kids menu, but being that in the past they'd give crayons and something for the child to color, after being seated I went to ask if there were any crayons. Both girls the short Hispanic one with straight hair and lot of make up and the other thin one with the curly hair they both looked at me with some anger in Their faces and just said ""we no longer give out crayons"". Even my 2 boys asked why did they talk to me with such attitude. After waiting for more than 1 hour to be seated when we finally were seated the table was wet and the check and cash from the previous guests were still on top of the table. I went to let them know that the payment for the previous meal was on our table and the short girl with straight hair again very rudely just said ""the server will take it"". There was no ""Thank you for letting us know"" there was never ""we apologize for the wait"", nothing! After 3 times of getting attitude and unprofessional treatment from the hostesses we just didn't feel welcome and stood up and left to another restaurant that welcomed us and didn't make us wait over an hour. These 2 girls were extremely rude and unprofessional. They must be trained on how to treat guests. It is a shame that a family of 5 that used to eat there regularly will not longer do so because the 2 people that should feel guests welcome have an unacceptable way of treating cheese cake factory's customers.

It's 10:25am, they should never be waiting on coffee to brew, especially on Sunday brunch!!!  10:30 ish coffee, OJ and the waters appeared.  And then, what I think was the manager finally showed up, and asked if everything was okay.  Well... I told her it was extremely slow... And I wanted to say more, but I had a lot of children in the area.  10:45am food arrived, omelette, crab hash with poached eggs took 30 min to complete (Gordon would not be happy with this level of service).  11:00am check came, and I gave her my Visa card at the same time she gave us the check.  I should've opened and checked first, but I didn't want to be there any longer.  Bottom line; $58.72 for breakfast for 2, decent food, with slow motion service.  And, it was breakfast folks, not a brunch, but breakfast... a true brunch, you wouldn't be ordering ala-carte off their menu.  So, if you are looking for a true brunch, with good service, great food, in a timely manner, the Cheesecake Factory @ the Bridgewater commons is NOT the place to go folks!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=80

Laura P.,"New York, United States",846,391,238,4.0,21/8/2012,"Cheesecake Factories are a popular place, so it's never surprising to me that the wait on any given day at any given hour is, at a minimum, twenty minutes. However, surprisingly enough, my last visit to a Cheesecake Factory, with my family on a Sunday around 12:30PM, did not come with a wait and we were seated immediately. The menu is overwhelming, especially for people who have never been to a Cheesecake Factory. Two of the people I was with had never had it before and found it hard to choose just one thing to order. Our waiter was very friendly and suggested some of his favorite dishes. Clad in the classic Cheesecake Factory white outfit, our waiter was a young guy with spunk, very eager to take our orders and bring us our food. I traditionally get an appetizer as a meal because of how daunting I find the rest of the menu, as well as the portions of the regular size entrees. I got the cheeseburger sliders and a ""small plate"" of cheese quesadillas. We ordered the customary fried macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer to share, which absolutely blew the minds of the two who had never had them before. The mac and cheese balls are really one of the best foods to get at a Cheesecake Factory, or pretty much an restaurant.  And of course I got the raspberry lemonade, complete with crushed sugar around the rim of the big glass. I absolutely adore this drink from the Cheesecake Factory and find pure joy in the very existence of it.  The decor of this Cheesecake Factory was nice, as they all are. I think it could be classified as Grecian decor? Or European in general? I'll get back to you on that.  We were celebrating a birthday during this particular visit, and about six waiters sang ""Happy Birthday"" and brought a slice of chocolate cake with a birthday candle to the birthday boy. The cake was incredible and was surrounded on its plate with homemade whipped cream. A+ in my book. No matter how long you have to wait to be seated at a Cheesecake Factory, it is always worth the wait. I waited two and a half hours on Valentine's Day with a big group of friends and dates and we all decided by the time we were seated at 10:30PM that it was well, well worth the wait. This experience at this Cheesecake Factory was no different, even though we didn't have to wait at all for the always amazing experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=100

Apart from the food, they also have a bar and a great ambience/interior decoration which is consistent throughout all their restaurants. While their dessert (Cheesecake) is what they are known for, their appetizers and entrees are also a delight. My favorite at the restaurant is the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo (Shrimp, Chicken, Andouille Sausage, Tomatoes, Peppers, Onions and Garlic Simmered in a Spicy Cajun Style Broth with Cream. Topped with Steamed White Rice). An appetizer I tried this time was the Tex Mex Eggrolls (Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese served with Sour Cream and Salsa).

The black beans and the rice was phenomenal it was so yummy but it was like on the side. they gave you four fish tacos and those tacos were literally the size of my hand. over all I would recommended it for people who like large portions of food. it's definitely not something  for food adventurists.

We waited extraordinarily long periods of time between getting water, ordering drinks and then having our order taken. We tried to do it all at once after our server's long disappearance but she kept telling us she'd come back and take our order later. We also never got that super wonderful basket of bread that you usually get (we asked for it after we realized that it wasn't coming)... People should know better than to deprive a girl of her sweet, sweet carbohydrates!!! After our food came out we never saw our original server again.

The reason I'm knocking this place down a star is that the service has been so miss recently.  We've had incomplete orders, very long wait times for the food and some pretty bad overall service.  It's definitely a slight change for this place because they never used to be like this.  I actually ordered the same salad on my last 2 visits and they forgot the exact same ingredient both times.  Without me even saying anything, the food runner noticed they had forgotten it and said he would bring it out to me.  I never saw him again.  Oh well.   I think you'll always like the food at this place, but it really has turned into quite an adventure.  I'm still going to continue to come, but I might have to temper my expectations.  I am super happy because it is Fall again and they do have Pumpkin Cheesecake back.  It's amazing.  Every piece of cheesecake I have tried here has always been great.  It's one of the best ways that you can end a meal and you can also easily get it to go.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=140

Mark H.,"Secaucus, United States",55,50,18,4.0,21/4/2014,"I never understood why people always raved about CCF, the previous two times I had dined there, the food was nothing special but always accompanied with a long wait. When my wife and mother-in-law wanted to go there for Easter dinner I was reluctant.   I had never been to this specific CCF before, so I decided to ""go with the flow"" and agreed. We waited for a table about 1/2 hour but considering it was Easter, I guess that's not all that bad. We were greeted by our waiter almost immediately upon being seated. He was such a nice, extremely personal guy and had a really great attitude especially considering that he was working on Easter Sunday. We ordered our drinks and he offed to bring some bread to our table. I had a Margarita on the rocks w/ salt. It was so so...a bit sour for my taste. Since it WAS Easter I decided to treat myself and I ordered the fillet Mignon. Wow, what a difference from my other visits. I guess that was the right thing to order because it was probably top 10 pieces of meat I've ever ordered. It was cooked perfectly and really had a great taste to it. It was salty which I like. Right up there with some of the better steakhouses I've ate at. I'm not a big dessert person so i didn't have any cake but my wife did and I guess she liked it because it was gone in less than 5. Coffee was alright...like the clear mugs. I'd like to bring up our server again because he really was good at what he does...I wish I remembered his name so I could give him credit. But he had dark curly hair and dark rimmed glasses and a soft voice. Not only was he friendly, but he also knew the menu very well and effectively described the items in question. He also made suggestions and went out of the way to make sure we were taken care of. A server of this caliber you usually don't see at a chain restaurant. The business should consider themselves luck to have such a great employee.  $125 for the 3 of us with 2 drinks each and fillet...not bad for Easter Sunday.

My table asked for more bread, and we never got it but the tables next to us did. It was also tough to catch the waiter for a refill.  My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken, which you could see was chicken fingers just dipped in sauce. I ordered the Renee special for lunch which comes with a soup (broccoli cheese) which was like mushy baby food. The chicken salad sandwich was okay but I had to take off the bread because I felt like it was doused in butter and it was pretty intense. We didn't order cheesecake but I would come back only for cheesecake in the future since you really cant go wrong with it.

She said ok..25 minutes later my friends get their drinks...5 minutes later they get there food. And I don't even have my drink after a half hour when I was the one that said I was in a hurry. As my drink came out after 35 minutes I told the waitress to cancel my food as I didn't have time (on lunch break). The remark I got from her was ""I put it in even before their's"" not an I'm sorry, it's on the house or anything. The manager came over without me asking and he was very nice and sympathetic, apologized,  and offer to wrap it up to go on the house. The only reason I would ever go back here is because this was the place I went on my first date with the man I love. If it wasn't for that I wouldn't return.

Abby B.,"East Meadow, United States",24,244,5,1.0,2/9/2010,"The good: beautiful restaurant and stellar wait service.   The bad: everything else It's bad enough that CF is notoriously un-veg-friendly (black beans cooked in beef broth, vegetable stir-fry cooked in oyster sauce, egg in just about everything: bread, pasta, avocado rolls, salad dressing), but I was still surprised by how badly my veggie meal was appropriated by an establishment who manages to prepare a veritable novel's worth of meals to perfection. I started with the edamame, which was served with bits of spaghetti mixed in, presumably from the shared boiling water.  Besides being tacky, since most of the pastas have an egg-base, I was not amused.  In addition, besides being grossly overcooked, the edamame were slick with what I hope was oil, but fear may have been butter... and the requisite sea salt was absent. Next I tried the white bean hummus.  A vegan dish by design, I was startled by the taste of cheese when I took my first bite.  A closer inspection determined the culprit; why would you melt cheese shreds onto the flatbread without a mention?  Finally, I ordered the fresh vegetable salad, minus the egg-laden pomegranate vinaigrette dressing.  I also omitted the cheese and the apples, subbing avocado.  I was charged $1 for the addition of the avocado, but strangely was not credited for the deduction of the other ingredients.  I do not like being nickel & dimed-- especially when it only goes in one direction. Can't The Cheesecake Factory take a cue from other large chains and at least indicate allergens on their menu, at most become significantly more friendly to vegetarians and vegans?

The prices reflect that too. I had a sandwich and my wife had a salad, my daughter had a kids meal, and we shared an appetizer and our bill was close to 100 dollars. Not that the food wasn't good, just felt it was slightly overpriced. Plus the service is slooooooow. Not a good place to take a 5 year old.

Note to self: don't come here on the weekend!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Jeff M.,"Salisbury Mills, United States",0,12,1,4.0,17/5/2015,"So something happened in the kitchen that resulted in two out of our three meals coming out badly, one needed to be sent back and completely remade.  The waitress got the manager though an they took care of it and made everything right.  I don't expect a perfect meal every time, but I expect that when things go wrong they make it right, and they did.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Mary D.,"Bridgewater, United States",26,2,,1.0,4/7/2015,The food is okay here. It always comes out cold! The service is really really bad! Every time I come! The only reason I come is it's in my neighbourhood and I like the cheesecake.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Sammy G.,"Albany, United States",169,555,378,3.0,26/7/2011,"I'm not a huge chain restaurant fan but on the occasion I will go to one and this time it was Cheesecake Factory. It's not connected through the mall so you have to walk outside to get to it. We didn't have to wait at all, but I think it was before the rush around 5:30 because when we left there was a wait list at 6:45. I don't think if there was a wait I would actually wait for it, the food is pretty good but not enough for me to wait 20 minutes to sit.  The menu is huge, there are tons of things to choose from and a variety of drinks and desserts. I rarely go here because there aren't many vegan options, some vegetarian but I don't think you can really eat vegan here, not that I know of off hand. I ordered the Four Cheese Pasta, I've never really gotten anything different, it's really good! Like everyone else said, the portions are HUGE. They give you free bread in the beginning, so it fills you up as well. It is tastey. Dessert, it is called ""Cheesecake"" Factory. And there are tons to choose from, I've had a few different ones and they're always delicious. I ended up getting the Red Velvet Cheesecake and it was a lot bigger then most! It's taller and wider, more layers and it's fantastic! I ordered it with someone else and after eating dinner we couldn't even finish it even though we split it! If you've never been, I would say try this place and see what you think. Out of the chains, I do like this one.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Sara M.,"Montville, United States",10,82,39,4.0,19/2/2015,The food is okay but who really goes there for the food. I love the red velvet cheesecake which is a problem!

Drew E.,"Manville, United States",165,13,,5.0,29/6/2015,"This place never disappoints. I've been here many times before but this was my first time since downloading the Yelp app.  This place is always busy when I come in but never fails to seat me within 10 minutes. The staff are friendly and prompt. They tend to your needs but don't dilly dally.  This time, my girlfriend and I had some sort of fried buffalo chicken appetizer to start. The only issue was that the portion size was too big, so we had leftovers for lunch the next day. We always order the same entrees and they come out as delicious as usual. The prices are great considering the portion size and we always look forward to going back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Mrunal S.,"Las Vegas, United States",1,4,,4.0,21/6/2015,"They have amazing cheese cakes , but the food was mediocre .. Maybe because we visited during a busy weekend .. I ordered some pasta and they forgot to add few things to it as I had asked .. Chef was good enough to come out and apologize and fix it for me",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Deborah N.,"Hillsborough, United States",68,24,,3.0,25/7/2013,"Just once, I'd like to walk in the door and be seated right away. I've been three times and each time my wait was upwards of one hour - usually two or more hours. Because it's a chain and the menu isn't inspired, the food really isn't worth the amount of time you're waiting for it. If you come on a weekend or special day like Mother's Day, the wait will be at least two hours. If you come during the week, expect to wait 45 minutes to one hour. The food is OK. My last visit is probably my last visit because I'm not waiting hours for overpriced chain food anymore.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Andy C.,"Edison, United States",0,9,,1.0,27/3/2016,Customer service is garbage here. Went in to purchase a few slices of cheesecake with my mother and the guy at the counter treated us like crap. He was insinuating that we couldn't afford to purchase food at the restaurant. Will never go here again!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Charlotte L.,"New York, United States",0,49,,4.0,27/3/2016,Had a delicious Greek salad appetizer along with steak tacos (would've preferred to have the ingredients and put them together myself - do they call that fajitas?) while my friend had almond-crusted salmon salad.  This is my friend's favorite place and she was so excited that I was amenable to going there after our jewelry shopping foray earlier in the day.  I know that the service at CF can be hit-or-miss. Today's was good!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
Crystal R.,"Raritan, United States",0,3,,1.0,26/10/2015,"Always have mediocre food. Menu is so large and varied, they are definitely ""jack of all trades, master of none...."" Food tastes like pre made frozen fare. Overpriced Applebee's style food. In general, I would give it 3 stars or so but tonight's meal was especially bad. Not my favorite place, but ended up here this evening because I had a gift card with money still left on it. Gift card was since Christmas 2014, so obviously I'm not a fan of going there or it wouldn't have sat in my wallet for almost a year.  I noticed after the fact that we were never offered bread. Other tables around us received some. By the time I noticed, I was well into the meal. food took forever to come out even though the place was not especially busy tonight. I ordered a factory burger. Figured they couldn't mess a burger up too much. Burger comes out with two small pieces of meat on sourdough bread, cheese isn't even melted on, and it has no caramelized onions on it. By the time our server came back to check on us, I had already eaten about half of it. Was I supposed to sit around staring at it while it got cold? Told her about the onions. She apologized but then the only remedy was I had to wait another 5-10 min for her to come back with a bowl of caramelized onions that I could add to my now-cold half of a burger. Uh, thanks???? was not even offered a free dessert or anything. Took her forever to get the check to us and she didn't even give me a pen for me to sign it with. Had to use my own from my purse. To top off the evening, I've felt sick all night since eating there. Bloated and just unwell.... I feel better after eating a #2 meal at Wendy's, and that's not exactly a good feeling.  This has not been a favorite place of mine, but after this experience I'm definitely not going back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120

Nicole P.,"Manhattan, United States",245,318,31,3.0,1/11/2013,"I wanted to give this store a higher review, considering my experience inside the store was so much better than the experience I had on the phone with an employee. I called on Wednesday night to order a cheesecake for my coworker's birthday. I was given a gift certificate to use for CF so this was the primary reason why I wanted to order here. The girl who answered put me on hold for over 10 minutes. I hung up. I called back and was put on hold for another 5 minutes. I hung up and called back. The same girl that was playing phone games decided she was finally ready to take my order. I ordered one 7"" pumpkin cheesecake and I asked for the cake to be taken out at 11am the next day to give it plenty of time to thaw out by late afternoon. When I came in Thursday, I was informed that the girl that took my order the night prior on the phone never put the order in! Thank goodness the gentleman behind the bakery counter was very friendly, competent, and helpful. He quickly brought out a chilled pumpkin cheesecake for me and apologized. I told him not to worry as it was not his error and thanked him for his assistance. The pumpkin cheesecake was definitely a treat for the palate. Ladies, if you save up your calories one day, this cheesecake is well worth the mileage.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
M B.,"Chatham, United States",4,19,8,3.0,15/6/2014,"For a chain, three stars is high praise!  The selection is vast and the service was attentive (we were eating in the middle of a shift change and the new waiter came over to introduce himself and ask if we needed anything). My favorite dish was the Santorini Salad - a faro based salad that was sublime.  The rest of the food was well prepared and special requests were honored.  My waiter forgot if I wanted to omit the feta cheese or the beets so both were left off the salad and brought to me in side dishes so I could add the one I wanted, and leave off the one I did not.  The only thing that really bothers me about this place is the cavernous sites they all occupy - so noisy!!!  It's hard to take after a while.  I recommend going on off hours if you hate cacophony.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bridgewater?start=120
