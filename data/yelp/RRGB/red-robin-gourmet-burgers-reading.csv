Ken A.,"Douglassville, PA",0,14,3,3.0,9/30/2017,Our visit started with call ahead we were told 15 to 30 min wait and it took 10 to get there unfortunately it was a 45min wait . The manager was aware of this and comped us 2 starters that were both very good. Our burgers were all ok but all the fresh fruit/ vegetables were very old and they should of been ashamed to serve them the carrots and salad were old And dried out and the fruit salad had strawberries that were starting to rot,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading
Sam K.,"Reading, PA",0,2,,1.0,1/14/2018,"Normally I don't have an issue with Red Robin, but this is absolutely ridiculous. We've tried calling both the carside to go extension and the regular customer service extension multiple times over the last hour to no avail, waiting as long as five minutes for someone to pick up. This restaurant also did not show up on the online ordering option like it normally does, so I'm not sure if their system is down, or if they forgot to tell people that it's not a thing anymore. Regardless, it's poor customer service and totally unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading
Christopher B.,"Dennis, NJ",1,11,29,3.0,7/24/2017,So lets start this review off by saying when we ordered drinks they had no ginger rale so i got a root beer. I didn't order an appetizer so i ordered my meal a Cheese Berger which took forever then finally our waitress came but no food....  Well guess what our food was dropped our waitress said that another waitress dropped it but they redeemed their self for that one by subtracting the burger from the bill then for dessert i ordered a Cheesecake which also took long but don't worry that wasn't dropped but anyway the Cheesecake was also great so overall this red robin was ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading

Brian Z.,"Reading, PA",0,92,,2.0,3/25/2017,"I still like this place even after my latest visit. Monday night, about 7:30.  No wait, seated immediately. Waitress came fast enough but she seemed like she could care less. My order came out correct but my friend asked for no bun.  Since chain restaurants use the absolutely asinine practice of server sharing, our waitress wasn't the person who delivered the food. The woman who delivered the food was out of there like the roadrunner. Maybe the original waitress didn't write down no bun but the BS that comes with server sharing prevents any rectifying the mistake.  Maybe the hamburger robot in the kitchen was malfunctioning. Whenever a place uses server sharing they get the absolute bottom end of pre-tax tip.  No one does a decent job then no one gets a good tip. Otherwise, the food has always been good here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading
Albert S.,"Reading, PA",0,1,,5.0,9/8/2017,"I am a CEO - I deal with all sorts of people everyday. I naturally review review and review.  First: I was seated instantaneously. Second: It was beyond spotless. Third: My waitress was amazing and kind - she also the booth right next me thanked a Marine for his service...it meant a lot to me because I am a Veteran too. Fourth: The food was great too. Now my sons were nuts, but what can you expect from a 9 year old and a 4 year old. Ultimately it was a great success. Kids are happy, I was happy, I had a Daddy's night out with my sons - and most importantly a Veteran felt honor...I spoke to him myself. I wished I got my waitress's name so I could include her in this review, but it's probably best to keep a hero's work silent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading

Andy M.,"Carmel, IN",0,23,,2.0,4/2/2017,"I'm always sad when I don't heed the star rating on Yelp!  Poor dining experience here!   Here are some highlights: 1.  10 minutes for the waitress to acknowledge our existence after seating. 2. No napkins or silverware on the table 3.  Waiter drops the appetizer on the table in a fly by and says "" running low on plates"" and doesn't even slow down.  Here we sit with greasy onion rings, no plates, silverware or napkins.  I assume they expected us to eat off the table like Neanderthals. 4.  Waitress wanders by again, sees no plates.  Advise her of her coworkers warning that the restaurant is ""low on plates"".  She rolls her eyes and gets some plates. 5.  Apparently Red Robin cooks burgers two ways - Pink and No Pink.  Here they cook them Pink.  Period.  Even if it turns your spouses stomach.  They ask what you want.  They bring you Pink.    Usually I try to end wIth something positive.  Got nothing this time.

A K.,"Reading, PA",0,2,,2.0,11/6/2016,"Close to home so we stop in approximately once a month. I think they have lulled us into accepting mediocrity. I can't remember the last time I ate here and it went smoothly.  The food is usually ok, but the accuracy and response time is poor at best.  The server asked us if we wanted an appetizer, so we ordered onion rings. 20 min later our burgers arrived- no onion rings yet. We tell the server, she says ""Oh, let me check on that"". 5 min later she comes back and asks if our food came out alright. We again tell her about the missing onion rings, she acts like this is the first time we are saying this. She says she'll check on this. Eventually the appetizer shows up. Didn't get a chance to talk to the manager, he was too busy putting ""fires"" out at other tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading
Kimberly B.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,20,,1.0,2/6/2016,"Ugh. I don't like leaving poor reviews, but our experience last night deserves one. We took our two sons, wanting to stop in what has been one of our favorites. We hadn't been to this location yet, and we probably won't be back. We waited for over an hour for our main course; no explanation or anything from our waitress. Luckily we asked that the kids' meals be put in right away so they could eat; they came out fine (with the exception of the server somehow putting sweet potato fries with both, even though that's not what we ordered...) We finally had to flag down another server to speak to a manager. We asked for our food to go, as we didn't want to sit there any longer. To his credit, he go everything to go and comped the main dishes (my husband's and my meals) but our order wasn't even 100% right when we got it home.  So I would avoid this location. I hope our experience is out of the ordinary, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem that way based on the other reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading
Toby E.,"Reading, PA",0,10,,5.0,4/29/2017,Service at this Red Robin was great! Been going here from time to time over the past few years now. Thy decided to take a drink off the menu that I always drank when I was there. Asked the server about it and she confirmed that yes it had been taken off the menu. She informed me that even though it was no longer on the menu she would still have the staff make it for me! She could of easily just said no we no longer have it but she went above and beyond to make us happy. I will definitely be going to this Red Robin more often now!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading
Mike L.,"Reading, PA",59,13,4,2.0,1/20/2017,"This review is based SOLELY on our last experience at Red Robin. Usually, this is one of our favorite places to go when we want simply beer and burgers. Are they the greatest burgers on the face of God's green earth? No, but they are damn tasty. My wife and I ordered the onion ring tower and drinks, which all came out promptly. We ordered our burgers and then proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and did I mention that we were waiting? Our waitress, seemed to avoid us which led me to believe that she messed something up, which is fine. I don't expect perfection, if  you made a mistake just say so instead of us sitting there watching our server walk past us a bunch of times to serve food to people who came long after us. We watched 3 people arrive, eat and pay all during the time that we waited for our burgers. Finally the manager, came over and apologized and said that the kitchen lost our ticket. I worked in restaurants and interpreted that as follows...""your server never entered it but it's a lot easier to blame the faceless kitchen rather than the person I will be sending back over to your table in 5 minutes."" Either way, I didn't mind that a mistake was made, just that the server clearly avoided us rather than simply stopping by and acknowledging that we were waiting a long time. If she would have come over and said ""I am sorry, something happened and the kitchen didn't get your check or (enter whatever excuse you want here) and then  offered an appetizer or the french fries, that are bottomless anyway, while we waited, it would have been perfectly fine. The manager did a great job, she acknowledged, apologized and comped our food. She said that she could not comp our alcohol, understandable, but ended up giving us gift cards that totaled the amount of our drinks anyway. We will be back as I said this place is usually really good, but this particular time was less than optimal. On the bright side, I am really happy that Red Robin is utilizing the NoWait app, we could ""get in line"" at home and then by the time we arrived at the restaurant our table is ready. As packed as this place can get at times, that is handy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading
Jeanette F.,"Douglassville, PA",42,8,,2.0,8/8/2015,"Second time with a terrible experience here.  I was willing to give it another shot because my daughter wanted to come for her birthday.  Unlike the first time we were seated right away ( we tried for a very early dinner and the place waa fairly empty). Our waiter didn't know how to work the electronic ordering on the table so we had apps that arrived at different times.  The fact that we had a waiter but he used the electronic ordering was confusing.....since we could have done the same thing.  He didnt come by often.  The worst part was we didn't get our dinners until we had been there for an hour!  Other diners had come in after ordered ate and left before we were even served.   Our food was cold and had obviously been under heat lamps for awhile.  We complained to the waiter who got the manager who was willing to comp us dessert but none of us wanted.  Instead she gave us gift card for ""next time"" even though we told her there wouldnt be a next time.  On top of that there was a problem with our bills and the couldn't find our appetizers.  Because of that they weren't charging us for half of them.  Then the waiter never to collect the signed slip nor did he give us a copy.  We gave the signed slip to the hostess to make sure we were charged correctly.

Tara Marie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,57,23,1.0,6/29/2015,"We have come to Red Robin somewhat routinely, so overall we have liked the restaurant and seek it out because it's a good place for kids and they have a good menu.  This time we were coming back from a camping trip, and we stopped for a long awaited meal (after eating camp food for 5 days). I noticed that their menu had changed since we last came, so we thought this might indicate improvements.... Not. so. I saw they had gotten rid of the different sizes for salads, which I was fine with. I ordered the Whiskey Rio BBQ Salad without meat (since I am a vegetarian). Not ONE of their salads comes without meat (except the house salad) so I am always forced to make modifications. The waitress said she would add extra baja veggies and avocado in place of the meat. My sons ordered mac and cheese and grilled cheese off the kids menu. 1. When the salad came, I couldn't believe how much they had reduced the quantity and quality. I used to have trouble finishing their salads, but this was served on a plate, with one thin layer of lettuce, fluffed up to look like more. It had a meager sprinkling of tiny cubed tomato and some corn, with 2 tiny circles of bread and 3 thin slices of avocado. If there was ""extra"" anything, I can't imagine how the salad would look without extra! There was nothing of substance to that $10 salad, and I was still hungry after eating it. There was just nothing but lettuce, tomato, corn, and a little bit of avocado, and it was about the size of a house salad.  2. They reduced the size of the grilled cheese sandwich for kids and cut it up into little pieces to ""confuse"" you and make it look like more. The fries were limp and undercooked. My son was also still hungry. 3. My other son's mac and cheese was cheap, flavorless ""from a box"" macaroni. Very inexpensive to make and not quality. He ordered a fruit cup, and it was absolutely disgusting; mushy, disintegrating fruit floating in a mash/juice mix. He LOVES fruit, and he hated it. He actually told the waitress it was disgusting, but she didn't offer to get him anything else or say anything about it... 4. The waitress was generally unresponsive and awkward. She wasn't rude, she just didn't seem to respond to anything. It took a long time to get her attention after I got my salad, she didn't really have anything to ""say"" about the issues we were having. When my friend ordered a salad without meat and asked what else he could substitute, she said ""Why? Are you a vegetarian?"" That's just an odd thing to say, and it felt like being questioned or judged about his tastes. Normally when someone orders something at restaurant, the waitress doesn't say ""Why?"" or ask questions. It's implied that we don't like something if we aren't ordering it... She didn't offer my son a replacement on his fruit cup, and she didn't apologize for the tiny salad or the limp fries. Just a very odd social demeanor.  I probably won't be back. It seems to me that they are changing the menu to reduce portions and quality deliberately, and I am tired of feeling like I get ripped off when I go to restaurants. Salads are already overpriced at most restaurants to begin with, and this was off the charts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading

Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,3.0,4/30/2014,"I've had problems with this Red Robin in the past because they were part of a different loyalty system that is not Red Royalty. On a recent visit to Reading, I stopped by to ask them about it and was told that they were switching to Red Royalty within a few weeks. So hopefully by now, that is no longer a problem. This Red Robin is in a strip mall on Route 422 westbound. If you're heading eastbound, a left on the first traffic light past Red Robin will get you there. The touchscreen device on the table is a bad trend that I hope will end soon. It has its uses; you can use it to order extra items and pay your bill. However, I noticed that the screen kept going back to the games section offering unlimited play for a fee. So I kept that device turned away the whole time. It's an annoyance. The food and presentation of such are top-notch for a chain restaurant. However, the burgers are pricey for what they are. Service was good that night, although I noticed this does vary.

Lou D.,"Denver, PA",3,46,,2.0,10/28/2015,"Its a shame, the management really is good, people are nice but they really strive on alwats fixing the meal vs getting it correct the first time. Things like simple request ""hold the mayo"" , or Ordering Gluten free and they just dont get it correct. One visit we ordered a burger 100% exactly to the menu and it was made incorrectly. So you have to just say , ok lets just pass on this place, they mean well but its fast food and I can go thru the drive thru at Burger King and have a better chance of getting it correct, or 5 Guys and they get right every time.  Frys lol , bottomless you get 6 at time , then you order more and they have to cook them everytime , so your refill of 6 more frys come out at the end of your meal when you may order desert.

Alyce T.,"Douglassville, PA",2,15,,3.0,5/18/2014,"Red Robin was our go to place whenever we went out to eat.  It is affordable and family friendly - our 4 year old loves it.  However, over the couple months we had stopped going as frequently because we had some bad experiences.  I'm not sure what changed but tonight was another less than successful dinner experience.   I ordered no tomatoes or mayonnaise on my burger but there were tomatoes (not a big deal).  Two other members of our party didn't receive the dipping sauce for their fries (again, not a huge deal).  Then it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks when we saw them sitting right next to us at the bar.  When our waitress finally came over, we got quite the attitude.  There were some other little nuisances that occurred that on their own may we have overlooked...but because so many issued occurred, it kind of ruined the night.

If you go there anytime on their slow time They have no waiters they just seat you near the bar where the bartender takes your order. There's nothing wrong with the bartender being a waiter but when they don't want to be a waiter because they're a bartender the service is the worst ever. I think next time I go I'd ask to sit not near the bar so I could possibly get a real waiter that will be fast an know what to ask.

Stephanie D.,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",32,5,,1.0,3/26/2016,"Went here with my family and my aunt ordered a ceaser chicken wrap with no lettuce, no tomato, no onion. She received her wrap and had tomato on it. She brought it to our servers attention and she takes it and brings her a new one. When my aunt received the wrap a second time it had lettuce on it. The GM was standing right next to us the whole time and blatantly didn't bother to ask us what was wrong when my aunt pushed it away and said ""I'm not eating this, it has lettuce."" Then when we received the check the Caesar wrap was still on our bill, we then told the waitress since she didn't eat the wrap it shouldn't be on our bill, she then said ""I'll ask my manager to take it off..."" Well that should be obvious if she didn't eat it we shouldn't have to pay for it.

Christopher G.,"Troy, NY",5,6,1,2.0,10/3/2014,"I will start off saying, the food was not bad or great.The reason they received two stars and not less is because we were promptly seated and had a very courteous waitress named Kelly.The food  was what is to be expected for a chain restaurant. We went because it was my birthday to receive the free burger as per the loyalty system. When we received our burgers and fries they were lukewarm at best and that's when this place started losing points in my book. I drink tap water all the time without problems and could not stomach the water at this location, having to buy a drink instead.

Wifey ordered a cheeseburger with ""unlimited fries"" & I ordered a blue cheese as cheese on my burger with ""unlimited"" onion rings. Both well done. Both burgers were extremely delicious!!! Chargrilled favor,just  the right amount of cheese. Unlimited fries & onion rings, that description is funny. Usually that would mean a large overflowing amount of rings and/or fries that usually get thrown out. Wifey had maybe 6-8 steak fries and I had 4-5 onion rings.  neither of which were completely  gobbled up. Good menu enticement ""Unlimited"" I don't think anyone could/would ask for more. Everything was very good. i had a orange cream soda which did not include a refill as usual nowadays. 2 at $3.79 was a waste of money but were good. Burgers $10.79 each. $33.00 plus tip. I lived very near the RR in extion/lionville and only ate their once, still trying to remember why didn't I go there again in 20 yrs.

This is the first time I've ever been sick from eating here, but I don't eat here often. Like, at all. Ever. Now I know why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=20
Barb S.,"Honey Brook, PA",0,5,,4.0,2/8/2015,"We ate there last evening and had a great meal.  We were shocked to see recent reviews.  The only problem was i wanted 'no pink' burger and husband ordered 'some pink'. It seemed they reversed.  Our waitress was attentive,  the onion rings crispy, burgers not greasy.  Hopefully they are listening reviews!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=20
BJ E.,"Philadelphia, PA",58,123,48,4.0,9/6/2010,"This was the very first Red Robin I've ever eaten at.   I was sold on my first visit here.  I had the Prime Rib Dip and loved it.    The food is delicious here and the staff is always very friendly.  (and usually very easy on the eyes.)    I've only had one semi irritating experience there, but that seemed to be chalked up to a busy evening combined with a new server in training. I eat here 2 to 3 times a month and will continue to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=20
Mark C.,"Reading, PA",17,24,,1.0,1/11/2015,We both got food poisoning here last week. Avoid! Service wasn't too bad but something in the fries got us real sick.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=20
Stephen K.,"Reading, PA",0,20,2,4.0,8/3/2013,"I have no complaints towards this Red Robin at all. I've been here multiple times and my service and food each time was at least satisfactory. I've never had to wait to be seated there which is always a plus. I've never strayed from the burgers, even though I've been wanting to, they're just so good. Even better they come with ""bottomless"" steak fries. They aren't really bottomless, but more like an extra bowl or two and then the waitress/waiter will bring the check out. The fries though are quite good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=20
Greg S.,"Morgantown, PA",9,30,9,4.0,12/3/2010,"Red Robin is one of the better chain restaurants you'll find, which is why I give it 4 stars. I tend to rate chains on a little bit of a curve because I avoid most of them, but Red Robin genuinely earns all 4 stars. The burgers really are quite good, typically cooked properly and prepared with fresh toppings and condiments. If you like steak fries - these are pretty good. The big fish sandwich is excellent, as is the pot roast burger. Actually, that pot roast burger is one of the tastiest things you'll find according to my wife. The service has always been excellent, and it's great for kids.  Red Robin has a birthday club type of deal where you can sign up to get a free burger during your b-day month.  I enjoy Red Robin and my family includes it in our rotation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=20
Brian B.,"Columbus, OH",0,16,,4.0,8/9/2015,"Being a chain, the experience here is pretty predictable. My family and I went out to dinner here a couple weeks ago and were pleased. 5 of us at 7 PM, and we got a table in about 20 minutes. (Not having a cell phone, I get annoyed by the paging system some restaurants have adopted where they will text you when your table is available, but they called my name when I told them I don't have a cell.) My father in law ordered one of the gourmet burgers (something with smoke and pepper, I think) and raved about it during and after the meal. The allergy menu is very informative and user friendly (it's on an Ipad) and our particular waitress was very well-informed and helpful in using it. The draft beer menu wasn't anything particularly impressive, but they had a decent selection of craft brew in the bottle (my father in law and I both ordered Stoudt's DIPA, which was quite good but probably had been in the cooler for a while since the hop aroma was lacking). Red Robin has adopted an on the table tablet side-menu and game system, which is sort of cool in that you can pay with plastic at the table and order drinks through wifi (as well as play competitive games with others at Red Robin for $1.99) but also a tad annoying in that it's a bright shiny thing glaring up at the table, drawing your eye during conversation. It'd be nice to have a way to turn it off, though we just turned it away from us during dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=40
Kitty H.,"Orlando, FL",13,111,4,3.0,6/24/2012,"It's a chain- so it's not going to be any different than other Red Robins for food and decor.  Staff was ok- even though it was crowded they seemed very frazzled and over worked, weird on a Saturday at 2 with only 1/3 of the place full.  So that's what my score is based on.  Could have used a bit more attention, getting drink refills and the requested ketchup in a bit more timely fashion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=40
Ken G.,"Reading, PA",0,15,,2.0,5/9/2011,Overpriced for what you get.    Costs too much.    Throwing away your money. Did I mention that they are overpriced?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=40

Bechego E.,"Birdsboro, PA",8,79,376,4.0,12/26/2010,"Are you looking for a Gourmet Burger? Do you have at least $10? If so, come to Red Robin and you will not be disappointed. Why not five stars? Well, I've had some really good burgers in my life, and I can tell the difference, but around this area, this is among the best! They also have an awesome variety too, not just burgers! Good salads! The onion rings are good too! If you like burgers, give them a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=40
Janet H.,"Birdsboro, PA",32,102,81,5.0,2/21/2010,"This is the best burger place around! The atmosphere has a great West Coast feel with lots of things to look at if you get bored with your partner.  The outdoor dining area is great in the warmer weather.  I love the Royal Red Robin Burger, which consists of a burger with a fried egg on top.  Just don't get your cholesterol level checked after this one!  I highly recommend the baked potato soup and wrap, and the Onion Ring Tower-dipping sauces are great!  The open kitchen is fun to watch too!  Wait staff is a bit too attentive, if that's possible, they are at your table refilling drinks constantly.  The restaurant has a bottomless soda and fries policy.  I dare you to eat more than one serving of the great steak fries!  Buy some Red Robin seasoning to go in order to duplicate your experience at  home.    The chocolate dessert is to die for and I would go there just for the dessert as a meal.  I've been there several times and plan on returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=40
Myron D.,"Reading, PA",0,4,,2.0,9/12/2009,"I came here recently with family, within the first week of its official public opening. The place was swarming with teenaged waitstaff, partially because of the recent opening, I assume, which required franchisee trainers to supervise the recent hires. This was mildly annoying, because it seemed that I couldn't walk a step without bumping into somebody who worked there. It was also kind of disconcerting to see so many workers just milling around not really doing much, as the number of workers actually outnumbered the patrons. Prior to coming here, I had read up on this place online, saw a few commercials on TV, and generally got the impression that this was a ""gourmet"" burger joint several cuts above the run-of-the-mill stuff like Wendy's and Burger King. The ornate and flashy decor certainly did nothing to dispell this expectation. The food, however, did not live up to those expectations. I ordered the ""Banzai Burger"", and my dining companions ordered the Royal Robin and the Classic burgers. When the food first came to our table, I swear, we had trouble figuring out which was which, as they all looked the same: a little patty with some charred toppings sandwiched between what looked to be a Holsum bun. $9.99 for a burger and it looks like something from a country fair. Amazing. The steak fries were generic frozen fries popped into a deep frier - nothing like the killer fries from Five Guys, for example. The burger was bland and flavorless, despite the supposed pineapple and teriyaki my burger was topped with. I wouldn't be so harsh and critical if it wasn't for the cost of this food. Each burger is priced at $10 or so, which is ridiculous amount to charge for food that one could find at a hole-in-the-wall diner. The entire establishment, indeed, seems to be built on a shaky foundation of pretense and deceit. Gourmet? Hardly.  If I want a good burger (at a much cheaper price), I'll just go to the recently opened Five Guys instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading?start=40
