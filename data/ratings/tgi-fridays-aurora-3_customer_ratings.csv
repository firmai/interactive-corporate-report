100,Jason A.,"Aurora, CO",3,85,,4.0,2012-02-02,"Beer pretzels and cheese Zomg. Just wanna swim around in it. Warm soft chewy breadsticks. That app is to die for!! If you like cheese sauce, and come on, who doesn't?!??! I usually am very boring and predictable but I got the tomato soup, ham cheese grilled trio thingy. Its more a lunch item but you can get it whenever. Its a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, its more grown up with white cheese, a semi-zesty sauce and a darker rye/grainy bread. A small bowl of soup, and it comes with fries, but they will sub veggies or a salad. I'm pretending to be on a diet so I get the salad. My man gets the sizzling chicken and cheese. WHATS with all the cheese I know I know, but remember again, who doesn't like cheese. It has a mexican flair with all these onions and peppers almost like fajita chicken but not quite. Its so good and the name says it all. Sizzling, gooey melty cheese that sticks to everything as it cools. It comes with garlic mashed potatoes.  I don't usually get dessert here. They seem to rotate their dessert menu all the time and I don't really like their basic options and everything they get something good its a limited time thing. And besides, I'm on a diet, wink wink.  They service is a bit here or there, and its so dependent on when you go, who gets you etc. They are also open super late like 12-1 am something crazy like that. We usually get average to good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=100,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192

110,Leza F.,"Fleetwood, PA",93,53,19.0,4.0,2012-03-17,"I haven't been to a T.G.I.Friday's since my 5 1/2 year old twin girls were in diapers and eating pureed foods.  We were in Aurora to pick up some stuff for my partner's computer business and everyone was hungry, so we stopped off here.  It was just after 7pm and we waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  We had our twin girls with us that evening and the place was LOUD! Our server was friendly, the drinks were constantly filled and the food made it's way out in fairly decent time, especially given how busy they were.  They have certainly changed up their menu and presentation of the food since my last visit to one of their restaurants...and personally, I think it's for the better!  I had the black angus sirloin (6 ounce pre-cooked) with sweet potato fries and grilled mixed veggies, which was part of the ""three for $16.99"" promotion they have going on right now.  I shared my mozzarella sticks (appetizer) and my Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert with my daughters...I also shared my veggies and fries with them, but ate the steak on my own.  I asked for well done and it was well done but still VERY tender and moist with wonderful flavor!  My kids both had the chicken skewers (taken off the skewer for the half-pints) with pita bread and mashed potatoes and they both inhaled it.  My partner had some kind of Argentina inspired pesto with steak and although she said her food 'wasn't that great'....she certainly did down the whole thing! The only real complaint that I have is the table next to us with the obnoxious children (who looked to be around the same age as our twins...one about 5 and the other about 4 or so).  The kids were running up and down the aisle, screaming, getting in the way of the servers (the aisle was already narrow), bothering other patrons and...well...just being BRATS!   Yes, I can make comments about this type of behavior because not only do I have kids that age, but my kids KNOW better than to behave like that in a restaurant!  They know it's inappropriate and would get them into a lot of trouble.  My older two, who are now grown (newly grown, BTW) also knew better than to show out in a restaurant like that -- even with ADHD and even when the meds were low and/or they were tired.   It's a bad thing when your five year old kids look at the kids running around like screaming banshees, look at you and say, ""why are they being bad, Mommy?""  Good question...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=100,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032

So i asked for us to be moved to a quieter area and were but i feel that it was the responsibility of whoever seated us to ask us this question prior. Next the burger i ordered was medium rare, when i got it, it was burnt to a crisp, and i mean to the point that if you took a chunk between your fingers and squeezed it, not one drop of juice would come out. In addition it was cold. The guacamole my wife ordered had hole chunks of avocado in it probably 1.5 the size of a marble.

I've been here around 6 or 7 times by now with various people...friends, family..boyfriend etc. We all love going. I have had nothing but good experiences here. There are always people waiting to seat you, our servers have always been friendly, some even exceptionally funny and interesting. The service has always been quick, I'm very picky about waiting too long for service, and the servers here always seem to be on top of things. My drink is always well attended to, and the food-what anyone goes out to eat FOR in the first place...phenomenal. I haven't tried EVERY part of the menu but from my several visits I can tell you the wings, ribs, and steak are all top-notch. Sweet potato fries are a favorite that I NEVER go without. Best appetizers so far would be the nachos and the pretzel sticks w/ cheese. During my most recent visit, yesterday, I found out that they have recently revamped their menu, so I tried something new. I think it was called ""Chicken Mushibi"". It was some kind of chicken skewers on a bed of rice with grilled zucchini and pita bread...mmmmm new favorite! Will be in soon for another visit.

The chips there really suck. They're hard, taste bland, and some are even grossly chewy, which is weird. The loaded potato skins were very yummy, with cheese melty and a decent amount if bacon. The green beans are pretty good, but the sauce was meh. The queso I got as a starter was so-so, but the beef chili stuff was really yummy. The buffalo wings were alright, but not very spicy especially since the sauce we chose was second hottest. My steak is delicious; juicy and cooked right! My mom's baby back ribs were way too salty and she said they were giving her serious cottonmouth. My brother's chicken and shrimp Alfredo was good; my fiancé's was burger good.

We even contacted corporate and they sent us a stack of buy one get one coupons, but even now, we would not even waste our time using them. The aurora mall location has been the worst. My fiancé orders the same thing every time and somehow they always get it wrong, it's right on the menu! He doesn't even make any special changes. The meal he orders is jack daniels ribs and a jack daniels steak, this time around he got barbecue ribs and barbecue steak, we asked for the correct meal and they brought it back a few minutes later with the barbecue sauce still on it but they just microwaved it and slapped jack Daniels on it. We immediately spoke with a manager who took it and had a fresh one made but she just brought out the ribs and steak and didn't bring his sides (even though she took them uneaten), we asked about this and she said the fries were still cooking.

50,Angel A.,"Aurora, CO",0,9,,1.0,2015-05-24,"Usually I take my kids to Chills every Saturday. This Saturday we wanted to try something different.   We always self seat at the bar so we can get half price apps, after we were already seated the host approached us and asked if everyone at the table was 21? It was obvious my kids 11 and 13 weren't. He was just being a smart ass and said there is sign that says they need to be 21, I told him I've never seen the sign so on our way to being escorted out he rudely pointed out the sign. I told him he didn't have to rub it in my face and he said i just want to make sure you see it this time. We were seated and waited about 5 mins before anyone came to get a drink order. There were about 7 other tables, 2 were wrapping it up. Once our food got to out to our table we had to wait another 5 minutes for silverware.  I ordered the pick 3 with pretzels, potato skins. NO BACON and mozzarella sticks. All came cold, sauces had skinned over. Pretzels were burnt, skins were full of bacon. I asked waitress if they looked burnt to her, she said nope. She took me back, they came back more burnt and with cheese sauce filled with bacon. She said this is what color they usually are. I told her to take a bite. She refused.  Manager came, told me I wouldn't be charged for food i didn't eat, duh!!!! Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=60,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.924,2.0

This place quickly reminded me why Boulder doesn't have nearly any fast food chains.  3 tables seated at the bar area, my friend and I were one of these tables. Two bartenders, one had to come over to get our drink orders started while our server struggled, but Im not sure why.  Friday's now offers, ""Happy Hour all day, every day."" which means there are $5 and $6 drinks and (limited) apps all day...its really nothing special. Id rather have all the apps half priced a few hours a day.  Just in for a quick snack, we ordered two beers ($6/ea) and two apps: Jack Daniel's Chicken Strips (an old fav of mine), and mozz sticks ($5). They apps came out lukewarm, and both were better in my distant memory of liking this place. The mozz sticks were really creamy, they didnt taste like cheese, it just kind of felt like cheese and looked almost like cheese. I don't need to go back, they don't even have good happy hour, for it being ""all day.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=60,1.92,1.92,1.92,2.12,1.92
47,Vanessa F.,"Aurora, CO",0,3,3.0,2.0,2015-07-04,"We used to LOVE TGIF! We were weekly visitors at the Parker/Chambers location. We now have visited the Aurora Mall location and every single time we visit, we are sorely disappointed, not only with service but also the food.  We came on 4th of July around 10pm and it was empty because the fireworks display had just ended.  My Husband ordered: Ribeye and shrimp, with loaded mashed potatos and cesar salad. Salad never came. Ribeye was supposed to be medium rare, it was well-done. Mashed potatos were not supposed to have chives, as my Husband is allergic to them and we told our waitress this. We also asked for extra Jack Daniel's sauce and offered to pay extra. Well, mashed potatos came with chives and Jack Daniel's sauce didn't come as requested. In her defense, she did offer to replace his meal, but as we had already waited 30 mins and were starving, we decided to take it as is.  I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp and asked for extra bruschetta. Instead of fresh, succulent tomatos, they splattered extra marinara all over.  The waitress said she would bring ice tea refills 3x...and never did. My Husband had to get up and go to the wait station where she was chatting and got it himself. Manager came by and saw this, he did not say one word at all.  They did comp the salad, so that was good. Overall, the experience was not what I expect from TGIF. Even our neighboring table complained. Their apps came out before drinks. Also, they asked the busser who brought out their apps for another round of potstickers. Busser said she would let server know. Server came about 7 mins later, they asked if their extra order was placed. Server said nobody told her.  At one point, a kitchen staff member with a hair net came to serve us. Clearly this restaurant has no communication within itself. Its staff is poorly trained at best and even management can't be bothered with customer concerns.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=60,1.96,1.96,1.96,2.088,1.96

82,Melanie L.,"Aurora, CO",0,3,,1.0,2015-08-03,"Worst experience ever! My husband and I went for Sunday lunch, restaurant wasn't very busy at all, however we were told the kitchen was ""backed up"", that's why it took more than 45 mins for the first order of Endless Apps to come out. But I'm jumping ahead. We were seated directly to the right upon entering the door, were told a specific waitress was assigned to us and then after what looked like some arguing amongst the servers we were finally assigned someone. Still took about 15 mins for out drink order to be taken. Then another 10 mins for the liquids to actually show up at our table. While we had plenty of time to wait we got a great show. 3 other tables surrounding us had major problems either with the kitchen or serving staff. We didn't want to fall into that category so we waited patiently. Unfortunately, we were sucked into the negative atmosphere because our first set of boneless wings came out w warm sauce covering cold pieces of chicken. We set it a side, finished the potato skins and placed our order for the next set of apps. Unfortunately this is where we were told the kitchen was behind. Again, looking around the place was not busy at all. 1 table asked for the manager who didn't show his face until 30-40 mins after they requested him, we had an opportunity to talk with them about there disservice. He then treated them to the nines and we still got the shaft. Even if you count the 2 sets of parties who left for lack of service. I'm pretty sure our server was scared to death of our entire area so we were included in her lacking our attention. The entire 2 1/2 hours we were there we only had 2 sets of apps and 3 refills. Tanay, our server could have made things so much better considering she only had 4 tables to attend to. She would disappear for such a long time we couldn't figure out where she went. She even asked me if I wanted my last refill, walked away for 20 mins, then walked straight towards our tablea grabbed my empty drink cup, walked away for a good 5-7 mIns and finally brought my drink.

The mashed potatoes seemed the same as they used to be. The Mac and cheese was missing the cheese part. It was just hard penne pasta. My wife ordered the potato skins, mozzarella sticks, and boneless chicken wings in the Memphis BBQ flavor. The wings were decent. The potato skins were missing the potato part.

36,Ali B.,"Cheyenne, WY",10,13,,2.0,2017-03-18,"I don't think I have ever had service this poor at a restaurant before. First off, they told us the wait would be 25 minutes (it's a Saturday night just before 630 pm) and told us we could go get drinks at the bar and wait for a table. We said we would do that. It took us forever to order drinks (they didn't have a beer on the menu I wanted and my friend was indecisive) so by the time we got our drinks we were wondering when my name would be called. We were halfway done with our drinks when my friend decides to check in with the hostess and see how much longer it would be. Apparently she had called my name and someone else took our table! Super rude. To be fair, they were busy so she probably didn't remember my face. They gave us the next table since someone took ours. They also carded us as we brought our drinks to the table with us even though the bartender carded us at the bar. We ordered the spinach and queso dip for an app. This probably took 45 minutes to come to our table. Our servers apologized profusely. The dip itself was good, as was the salsa and guac that came with it. They didn't give us enough chips and the servers cleared the app instead of asking if we wanted more chips (we finished the dip, but not the sides). We then ordered our entrees and my friend got another drink. I waited for a little bit before getting another drink. She got her drink (she asked for a strawberry mango margarita and got a mango margarita). After hers came out I ordered the same, but mine was served with a lime and significantly stronger than my friend's. We had probably been waiting on our entrees for 45 minutes at this point and finally my dinner was delivered. The manager came by after this and apologized for how long it had taken. He said he would comp my friend's food (buffalo wings- flats only) and would comp a portion of mine since I was supposed to have a tomato mozzarella salad with it and they offered me a garden salad instead. The server didn't ask what dressing I wanted and asked if ranch was okay. I said it was fine. A few minutes later a salad completely drenched in ranch came out and I had to dump it on my plate so I could see what was underneath the white sea of dressing. My friend had a bite of my Mac and cheese (enjoyable, but nothing spectacular) and ordered some for herself. I was darn near done my meal when my friend's wings (also enjoyable and all flats as requested) came out and they also served her a garden salad. They gave her no dressing with her salad or wings. Like me, silverware was delivered after the meal came out. It took another 5-10 minutes for her to get the ranch she had to request. Her Mac and cheese never came. After everything was said and done (we had been at the restaurant for 2 and a half hours), they made our bill $10. Not bad for a meal, 2 apps, and 4 drinks. However, when the bills came back (separate as requested) we both had to pay $10 which was not what the total bill said. I felt a little jipped, but I still paid way less than I would have otherwise so I didn't say anything. Our servers also asked us multiple times to come back and apologized for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=40,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.9600000000000002,1.96

And no broccoli and beans...(eye roll).  Food was good.  Lastly, the company took off the TGI on the name....really- did The ""G"" keep people from eating at these restaurants?  Learn how to make a drink, clean after hours AND stock up on your menu items!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3,2.12,2.16,2.16,,2.144

77,Noah C.,"Aurora, CO",2,3,,3.0,2017-10-19,Waitress too her time to come by and say hello. After she got to the table she was friendly. Food came out in good timing also food was very good and hit. Only real problem I had was a worker not yet clocked in showing his butt cause pants so low walking around with a hoodie cussing to rap music... First and last time coming to this TGIFridays... A place of business you would think they would have manners and carry themselves well. Wrong for this place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3,2.2,2.17,2.17,,2.1820000000000004
5,Gleneda H.,"Aurora, CO",5,32,,4.0,2017-11-03,"Thought I should post a review because it looks like this place has not always done well.  I just had late lunch of their Big Rib Special and found both the food and the service just fine.  No 5 stars because although the ribs were meaty and very tender their BBQ sauce was only average and the seasoned fries were too salty.  And there were no problems with service (granted not a busy time, but seems that has not made a difference according to some reviews).  Again just thought I'd take the time for a good review since there have been so many not so good ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=20,2.32,2.17,2.17,,2.23
0,Jean T.,"Sedalia, CO",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-26,"This place was FILTHY!  Tables, Windows seats...disgusting. food was over cooked . Ordered med burger, came out wells done and dry. The chips and salsa we ordered were over fried and I think left over from the previous day..not fresh. Even the onion rings were over cooked and hard as rocks. Won't be back. Only good thing was the margarita.  Should have taken a clue that there were only 5 cars in the lot at lunchtime on a weekend. Lesson learned..wont be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=20,2.24,2.14,2.14,,2.18

63,Michele S.,"Aurora, CO",0,7,,1.0,2017-12-25,"Wow! Walked into the bar here last night to pick up an order to go. Only one other person at the bar. The bartender was on the phone. The conversation did not sound at all like business, but who's to say. The point is, although he looked straight at me, he totally ignored me and talked for a few more minutes. When he hung up, he simply walked away. I thought, gee maybe he is psychic and has gone to get my order? But no, he seriously was just ignoring me. If I had not already paid for my order, I would have walked out. Either way this business has lost yet another customer due to poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3,2.2,2.12,2.12,,2.152

70,Karen S.,"Denver, CO",0,8,,1.0,2017-12-31,"Service was terrible and the restaurant was filthy. We had reservations and when we arrived the host was not at his stand and the entry was crowded with people waiting to put their names in.  When the host finally showed up, his IPod was not charged and he couldn't pull up our reservation.  I had to show it to him on my phone.  When he got us a table, it was not cleaned and he had to wipe it down himself. We sat for over ten minutes with no menus or water.  I had to get up and ask the host to send a server.  We had to get the menus ourselves from a table that had not been cleared.  The floor next to our table was disgusting and filthy covered with trash and food. The drink menus were sticky.  When we finally ordered, we asked for water.  We had to ask twice before he brought it.  My margarita had a few specks of salt on the rim, not a salted rim, causing me to wonder if the glass had even been cleaned. When our food finally arrived, my husband's order was wrong and had to be sent back. This was on Saturday night at 7pm.  It was a terrible experience and not cheap. It was not that crowded and there were empty tables that were not bussed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3,2.28,2.14,2.14,,2.196
65,Susan W.,"Burbank, CA",0,3,,1.0,2018-01-06,"Here on a Friday night for the rib special and shocked how disorganized and dirty this restaurant is.  If you're willing to put up with trash on the floor, side stations overflowing with trash and a filthy ladies room at 7 pm at night, then you'll love the rib special.  Although my guess is that the kitchen isn't much cleaner. Servers are too few and we're surrounded by customers complaining.  No manager in sight.  Hire more servers, put a bus boy on trash and put a manager on the floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3,2.28,2.1,2.1,,2.172
