Ronald v.,"Clio, MI",41,55,8,2.0,9/27/2009,"This was the only place that was still open at the time of night we were trying to have dinner. It's in a mall building, on the outside. Service was slow, even though the place wasn't very busy. Some staff seemed to be hanging around in the restaurant after they had finished working. Not a very pleasant atmosphere. Food was OK and the place was clean (I've seen much worse at other Friday's restaurants). Not something I would recommend....unless of course if you're like us and try to have dinner after 10pm on a weeknight :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hyannis
