Our food came out  quickly and was very good. If someone was to ask me where to eat in Warrington, I would definitly suggest here.

32,Theodore H.,"Pipersville, PA",42,56,2.0,1.0,2013-05-27,"I have to say, I've been here multiple times and I've never had a good experience here. Lets get started... *PLEASE NOTE: I've spoken to their guest relations about this establishment about the below incident* The last time I was here was with my g/f. We got seated promptly and then waited. About 10 min later another couple gets seated next to us. The waiter goes and greets them first and takes their drink order right away and walks past us. After bringing their drinks he comes to us and asks for our drink orders. We told him we were in a hurry, we wanted to see a movie and had time to eat but didn't want to dilly dally. We knew our entire order and was waiting on him. He told us that he was NOT going to take our food order right now, and that he only wanted to take our drink order. We politely told him we would like to put in everything since we were ready. He refused to hear it so we told him what drinks we wanted. He came back and then said that he could take our order, which could have saved us some time if we could have just put everything in together. Time goes by and we are waiting on our food, and finally it arrives. Something was wrong with my g/f order so now she's starting to get annoyed, but let it pass. We were never checked up on and it took a long time for the waiter to come back to us to even ask if we wanted anything else. She gets a drink and then asks for the check. I show the waiter that I had a coupon and he writes it down and goes to get the check. Another 10 or so minutes goes by with no check. My g/f is getting pissed by this point...then the check comes...and they didn't discount the food as was supposed to happen. That was the icing on the cake, my g/f gets up, goes to the hostess and asks to see the manager. The hostess goes in the back, talks to somebody and says he'll be with us. 10 more minutes goes by with no manager showing up. She gets up AGAIN and asks for the manager. The hostess goes back again to get the manager and finally he comes out and talks to us. He obviously apologizes for the service and the food, and does discount the bill but we were still pretty pissed that it took so long for the manager to speak to a guest.  We paid and left the establishment, and were lucky enough to make our movie.  Other past experiences with this place are pretty much the same, bad and slow service. I've never had good service here. I can't say anything for the bar, which I might try, but I'll never come here to sit and eat again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

27,Jennifer B.,"Independence, MO",0,2,,1.0,2014-06-30,Absolutely terrible!! The place is completely dirty and old. My mom went into the bathroom and one of the toilets was backed up and the floor was sticky inside. I had to ask our server 3 times for her to just get me a glass of ice water. Not to mention she took forever to even get our food out. When our food did come out my burger tasted horrible and cold like they had left it sitting up there. My aunt who was with us said when her food came out it tasted fine however there was a tiny piece of newspaper shoved underneath the food on her plate!! Then we're pretty sure they overcharged us on our drinks because the sangria I got was apparently $10? I did appreciate the fact that the manager tried to correct the problem by taking both items off the menu but I find it hard to believe that 4 drinks and spinach dip could have cost us $45.

First the sound was deafening, apparently a bartender contest.  We were seated on the other side of a partial wall.  Our waiter was pleasant enough, took drink orders - just 2 Coke Zero.  He took the dinner order - husband had the Jack Daniels burger, I wanted the petit sirloin - 6 oz cooked medium & a double order of broccoli - I was pointing to the doneness chart.  After about a 10 minute wait our dinner arrived.  Husband's burger was fine.  My steak looked like it had been dropped on the plate with grease all over.  I cut into it and it was well done and dry.  Trying to find the waiter was Impossible.  I got up and asked another waiter. About 15 minutes later the second steak arrived.  A manager delivered the second one.  He asked me to cut it to make sure it was the way I wanted it.  Unfortunately the meat did not have time to rest and all the juices poured out.  The manager made a comment that sounded like something would be compensated.  Nothing was done, very disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington?start=20,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998

The kitchen is ridiculously slow and the food was mediocre at best. I know it's a franchise and I shouldn't expect 5 star meals but come on, this is still a VERY well known restaurant and they should live up to their name. I spoke with the manager a blonde female who all but apologized and just stood there like a deer in headlights.

Don't know about going back. 3 times our drinks were brought to our table with lemons in them when we asked for no lemons. We asked our waitress why this establishment insisted on putting lemons in our drinks?  Her response was, ""Well we got your meals correct, didn't we?"" Really, not the response we expected. But they didn't get our meals correct. They forgot one of the items that my girlfriend was suppose to get with her meal. We had to remind them. We had 4 separate people taking our order. Our waitress was suppose to take our order,  but we think she was late. One of the managers took our appetizer order, someone different took our drink order, but someone different brought them. Someone different took our meal order, which was our waitress. Then someone else brought our meals. After we were done with our meal they tried to give us someone else's meals. And the place wasn't even busy. Guess we know why. We asked our waitress if a customer asked for no lemons in their drinks due to allergies,  but you kept putting lemons in the drinks, what would they do?

It was fun and my first trivia experience.  There were many rounds and we actually left before the game ended as we were travelling but what a great idea! There was a DJ playing music as well as running the game.   The space was a typical TGI Friday's space, not really crowded for the day before Thanksgiving but we were offered either free dessert or a free appetizer if we played trivia.  We choose the appetizer.  We picked the nacho chips with spinach dip as well as salsa and guacamole. It was a very large portion and we were both unable to finish and brought it home.  We also each ordered a dinner - I choose the chicken club with a side salad (you got to pick either a salad or fries with your meal) and my companion ordered a turkey burger.  Again, big portions and we barely started our meal and had to bring the orders home. I must add that there are a lot of restaurants on this road and I chose this because 1) it wasn't fast food like Wendys or McDonalds;  2) it was close to the road; and 3) I wanted a place to sit and relax a bit before I resumed my trip home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington,,,,,

I ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich.  My ""chicken"" had barely any chicken, 3/4 of it was just a hunk of fried crust.  I also ordered a side salad with my meal but they gave me fries.  They were burnt looking and cold...A very unpleasant combination.  I finally got my salad which was just a bunch of brown lettuce.  I couldn't finish my meal.  For the amount of money we spent we would have been much happier else where.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

Our server came to the table right away and took our drink orders, I went with the Sangria and my boyfriend got a soda. I figured the Sangria would probably be $6 since this is TGI Fridays after all. We skipped out on an appetizer and I got the Cajun and shrimp pasta (half size), and my boyfriend got a chicken and shrimp with mashed potatoes meal. It felt like forever for our food to come out. The food runner ended up walking past our table with our meals, because she was told the wrong table number. The entrees were served on skillets. I thought my dish was tasty but there wasn't enough shrimp and it wasn't that hot when it came out. What I did like was that the pasta came in a half and full size. My boyfriend told me that he liked his meal, I tried a piece of his chicken, but did not find it that remarkable. I was shocked after getting the bill to see that a Sangria was $10 here.

14,MeMe 7.,"Ambler, PA",99,7,6.0,1.0,2017-03-11,"I am very upset with the service that was provided to my husband and I tonight regarding our dinner. We sat at the bar for convenience however the outcome wasn't so convenient. After, placing our order and receiving our drink our soup and salad came out shortly. This was at 8:39PM. The salad was not good and my husband asked for a French onion soup instead. That arrived shortly and by this time our entrees should have arrived a few minutes after. After 30 minutes we still did not receive our entrees.  I asked the bartender that took our order if we could have a status. He went to that back and it tok him about 5-8 min to come back and he didn't even address the issue. I again asked him if he can find out where our order is and he said it should be right up. I also explained to him that the couple next to us ordered after us and has similar meals and received their food already and you also took that order. He then said, ""Let me find out where your food is?"" So, instead of him returning the other bartender brings the manager. The manager says, ""Do you want me to see how far along your food is?"" How far along the food is? Shouldn't it be done? So, I agreed to seeing where it was in the process. Which means it probably wasn't even cooked yet. They eventually comped the food and and the manager brought it out. I have to say she was not even apologetic towards the food taking so long. So, Now the bartender that attended to us comes out and asks us, ""Do you still want your food it just came out?"" Did he not communicate with his manager who just brought the food out? I wanted to inspect the food however my husband insisted that I just leave it alone being as thought they already comped the food. We got home and I obviously was still hungry. I opened up my entree and it was  was freezing cold and they didn't even get my husbands order correct. This is just a clear indication that the food was never made or they gave us someone else's that was sitting.
