244,Juan A.,"Lansing, MI",65,298,134.0,3.0,2012-01-10,Decent food like it's too expect from Red Robbin. I would give it a four just for the service. Our waitress and waiter were very friendly and helpful. They accommodated all the requests from my friends with a big smile in their face and I think that's a hard thing to find in a restaurant like this one specially in a busy Friday night. My only complaint was my almost 14 dollars shot.... It was just a shot of Jack and one of Jagger... Not worth it that much.....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=260,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

240,Amanda M.,"Vacaville, CA",51,245,42.0,4.0,2012-02-26,As chain burger restaurants go this one was not bad. It's clean with fast service. Our waiter was nice and officiant. We got our drink and app quickly and our entrees not long after. We got the tower of onion rings which were really good. Hot crisp and crunchy. I got the bleu burger with blue cheese and onion straws on it. Overall it was cooked well and had good flavor. My SO got a burger with jalapeños on it and he seemed to enjoy it. He said it would have been better if raw jalapeño was put on it and not the fried coins but he still enjoyed it. Plus they had a fresh keg of Racer 5. I would come here again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=260,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256
250,Renee W.,"Fairfield, CA",0,20,2.0,1.0,2012-03-10,"How would you LOVE to wait nearly an hour and forty-five minutes after placing your order to be presented with a cold, less than desirable looking meal? Or better yet would you LOVE to have a waitress with a snobby attitude? If you answered yes to any of these questions, Red Robin in Vacaville CA is the place for you!      My family and I foolishly came to this establishment to celebrate my father's 60th birthday and boy was this a mistake!  Upon being seated,we were promptly greeted by a snooty waitress who rushed us to place an order. 45 minutes go by and nothing, no food, no refills, and no waitress.  As my family and I grow curious we notice other parties (some) with far more people than ours quickly getting their meals and even leaving. We wait another 15 minutes and still nothing. So we finally track down our waitress to politely ask about our meal and why parties after us were served before us, she snapped ""well it's Saturday and I put their orders in first"" and shrugs her shoulders.  Upset we decided to give it a few more minuted,30 minutes go by and we decided enough was enough. We gathered our things and began exiting our table. Just as we were getting ready to walk away the manager lazily came up to us with a tray of food that looked as if it had been sitting on the counter for an hour,forgotten, and ran through a microwave in an attempt to reheat.  By that time my family and I were extremely upset, and had no desire to continue our horrible dining experience.  Both the manager and waitress were condescending and tried their best to be little my family and I. If i had to choose between returning to this resturant and starving, I would choose starvation in a heartbeat. Word for the wise, you would probably recieve better customer service at McDonalds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=260,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

We arrived at 11:00am right when they opened and to our surprise unlike all the other place in the area there were no lines or wait times. We were seated right away and water was brought out shortly after. Our server (I wish I remembered her name now) was very friendly, checked on us often and provided above and beyond service. She took the time to explain the different between a vegetarian and boca burger to my mom, helped us place an order to go with appropriate timing and hooked us up with my refill to go. Who doesn't want a raspberry limeade to go?!? As always I ordered the Royal Red Robin Burger and it was fantastic. It was a perfectly medium cooked patty, stacked with applewood bacon, cheese and all its burger glory with a fried egg (the best part) between toasted buns. With the bottomless fries and raspberry limeade I truly enjoyed my meal and left with the most fulfilling feeling ever. Mmm!!! I know where I'm going for lunch today...

To start off, we ordered salsa, guac, and chips to which there was a hair hiding in the salsa (yuck!). The meal was very good and very well prepared.  The Bleu Ribbon burger was fantastic as always. Our server was quick with refills for our drinks which is always a plus, however, toward the end of our meal the service started to fade.  Strong start but poor finish.  We had to ask several times for a box before we finally got one.  We ended up waiting 15-20 minutes for our server to finish up the whole process of getting us our bill, taking our money, and giving us a togo box.  Normally, this wouldn't be a problem but the place wasn't very busy.  Perhaps they are understaffed? Either way, customer service shouldn't be overlooked, especially in today's economy with the amount of choices each patron has. My advice, get your food togo, or else you will wait an unusually long time for mediocre service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=200,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

When this one opened up a little over a year ago, I was excited to have one near by. I've been there a hand-full of times during different hours & sat in different sections & must say they have the worst service I've ever experienced! The food was good, after waitng over 30 minutes for a burger each time, I'm over it! The service in the bar is horrible also. One night we sat in the bar section at a booth with friends(because there was a 30 wait for a table), we sat for at least 20 mins before anyone decided to come over & take a drink order. Our drinks came out at different times, my beer was flat! I asked for a different brand & it was flat too! After waiting for some time, we had to flag-down a waitress just to make an order.Another long wait for our food.... Our orders also came out at different times. My friends order finally came out after the rest of us were done with our food! No wonder there was such a long wait for a table, we were there for about 2 hours! My girlfriend reciently went with her daughter & warned her about the service, it was the same story. Not sure if I'll ever give this place another chance!

251,Elizabeth L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,88,,2.0,2012-12-31,"Stopped by here for lunch on a recent trip from the Bay Area to the Sierras.  Chose this place because I had heard they had a gluten free bun for their burgers.  Upon arrival, the service was great.  The hostess was friendly and sat us quickly with a smile.  The FOH manager (lovely young lady) heard us mention that we were very hungry and brought us some fries to tie us over until we ordered.  This is where the good experience ended. The waitress was unavailable and ignored our table for a long time.  We ordered two burgers, each with the GF buns.  It took over 20 minutes for our burgers to come out (in no world does it take this long to grill a burger to Med Rare) and when they did, they were COLD.  We complained and sent them back.  It took 10 minutes to get a second burger and when we did, they were terrible.  The burger tasted like it had been microwaved and the bacon on it was underdone and cold, so it just tasted like grease.  For a place where burgers are supposed to be the specialty, this is unacceptable.  Our waitress was never around and we had to go find someone to help us. The reason for two stars instead of just one is that the kitchen manager tried very hard to make good on this.  There was no charge for our lunch and the manager even gave us a gift card for a future visit.  I doubt I will ever return to a Red Robin after this experience and will give the gift card to a friend who might use it on her many road trips with the kids' soccer team. The issue here seems to be more with training.  The cooks have no idea on how to actually cook a burger and someone needs to tell the waitstaff to pick up there orders in a timely manner from the window.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=260,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.536,2.64

We should have known better that it was almost empty - we were seated promptly and our food took a while, but it was good. I ordered one of their new bottomless watermelon spritzers, and finished it midway through the meal. My meal had jalapenos in it, and I was given no water. Once we finally got our server's attention to get another drink, it still took about 10 minutes before she returned to say she was waiting for it from the bar. It's not alcoholic, but whatever. By this point I'm eating ice just to cool down my mouth. Another 10 minutes goes by and by the time we could flag her down AGAIN, everyone was done eating. SO I said I still needed the drink, and  to-go box, and she got rather snippy, saying, ""Well, I had to ring up another customer."" I held my tongue and didn't point out that it doesn't take 20 minutes for a refill. After dinner, my daughter and I used the restrooms, and they were in HORRIFIC shape. It looked like there had been a TP fight in there, with rolls all over the floor, and none left in the stalls. The paper towel trash was overflowing onto the floor. My daughter said it reminded her of a rest stop we saw in the Mojave Desert. If a restaurant can't keep their facilities clean, you have to wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen.

I used to eat at another location and remember how good the food was! When we walked inside this one, we had to wait a good 5 minutes while the initial host tried to find us a table. I was looking at all the empty tables wondering what the hold up was, but finally we were seated. The host and hostesses that we dealt with seemed pretty short, and not very friendly. Our waiter arrived and took our order and I could not find in the menu the buffalo wings that I used to love. I was assured by the waiter that they still served them, so placed a full order, and my son ordered chicken strips and fries from the children's menu. About 15 minutes later our food came out and I was surprised at the small serving size presented to my son. There was 2 small chicken strips and a handful of fries. The wings that I had ordered were NOT what I remembered, and the taste was very off. They were also very fatty and soaked in grease. I asked the waiter if these were indeed buffalo wings, as they were not what I thought I was getting. He then informed me that there was recent recipe changes and that they now go with this recipe where regular wings were tossed in a ""zing"" sauce. The sauce was oil based and not very tasty. He then offered to bring me out a side of the sauce. I have a feeling they have encountered this complaint numerous times. He apologized for the inconvenience and we finished our meal, not very happy at all about the quality of the food or service.

108,John M.,"Richmond, CA",938,1197,1158.0,3.0,2013-11-07,"When in Rome, do as the Romans do. What that translates to in Vacaville is dining at a corporate chain casual dining restaurant. For me & a lifelong friend meeting here in town, that's how we ended up being at Red Robin. I mean, this being Vacaville & all, your choices pretty much boil down to 1 variation on a theme or another of a Chotchkie's or a Flingers. We actually tried to go Fresh Mex 1st but that place was too busy. This place, on the other hand, had open tables & open seats at the the bar. We sat at the bar. Service from the bartenders was unremarkably OK. I ordered a Fiery Ghost Style Big Tavern Burger & we split an order of Towering Onion Rings. Our food didn't take too long. The Towering Onion Rings were served 1st. $9 seemed like a lot for this appetizer, but the Onion Rings were quite crunchy tasty & were served with 2 delicious dipping sauces. Since Red Robin's theme is burger joint & they make the ""best burger"" claim,  I was curious about how well they would perform in 2 aspects of my Burger: doneness & spiciness. I ordered my Burger cooked medium & it was supposed to have a Ghost Pepper sauce. The bun & veggies on my Fiery Ghost Style Big Tavern Burger were good. The burger patty, however, was slightly overcooked to medium well & needed more seasoning. Surprisingly, the Ghost Pepper sauce was actually respectably spicy hot with a nice smoky flavor. To wash down my Burger & Onion Rings, beer was the natural choice. The tap selection was much more macro than micro so I decided Guinness was the way to go. Now, there is a specific way to pour a Guinness correctly & the bartenders here had no idea how to do it. At the Red Robin in Vacaville, the Towering Onion Rings were good but pricey. The Fiery Ghost Style Big Tavern Burger was OK overall. & the way the bartenders poured Guinness would seriously piss off an Irishman. I know. I've had Guinness at Guinness' Gravity Bar in Dublin, Ireland. They take it seriously there & I guess I do too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=100,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.316,2.92

Sadly, I will not be going back to Red Robin for a vegan burger.   Service was great at first until our waitress said she had to go on a break and someone else was going to wait on us.  After that the service went down hill.   If you plan on ordering any burger here, make sure to order something that has lots of sauce or have them add extra sauce.  Otherwise, you might choke on their burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=100,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.408,2.96

146,Andy P.,"Cypress, CA",82,728,133.0,3.0,2014-06-16,"The only reason why I can't give this place a higher rating is that the all-around service is below what you'd expect from a chain establishment. First off, there is nothing wrong with the food quality or taste. Tastes great just like at any other typical Red Robin. When we arrived for lunch on a Monday afternoon, the place was far from bustling. We have a 3-year-old and she was not offered a kid's menu nor crayons/coloring sheet to play with. What got me a bit riled up was the fact that our order took, oh by my best estimate, at least 25 minutes to come out. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but again, the place was not busy. A little assurance or update by the wait staff in regards to our order would have been appreciated. Anyway, the only cool thing going for this place are those mini-iPad type devices at every table where you can order appetizers, drinks, and pay your bill. Seriously, with convenience like this, why would you need an inept wait staff?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=140,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.1239999999999997,2.52

I was feeling nostalgic for the fries, and hadn't been to a Red Robin in years. Thankfully, they did not disappoint; the fries came out warm and perfectly seasoned (though a bit late, and the sweet potato fries were incredibly subpar). Like many other reviewers of this location, I felt that the quality of service did not match the excellent quality of the food, but the server certainly redeemed himself by being much more attentive later in the experience (we even got more fries without asking) and his demeanor seemed became more relaxed. Overall, the service did not interfere so much with the quality of the food that I felt the need to drop the rating anything below 4 stars. Good on Red Robin for maintaining delicious burgers and fries and also infusing some character in the interior design of the restaurant, despite it being a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=260,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.288,2.64

We were lead to two tables which were dirty. The third table was least dirty so we were sat there. The ""ziosk"" electronic order/pay thing was sitting askew on the table and it looked like all the days crumbs had been pushed under there. Disgusting. I was hoping my Mom did not notice. The server arrived promptly and was nice. Our drinks came and we ordered. Then we waited. We never saw anyone that looked like a manager and our server didn't come back for a very long time. When the food arrived it was dry, cool and had the appearance of sitting under a heat lamp. The server nervously giggled and advised there were some large parties up front. Clearly she meant, the large parties took priority over us! The server came back once after that first bite and then disappeared. My Mom wanted more fries, never happened. I would've liked new fries as mine were cold and wilty! I paid the bill via the ziosk thing but my mom wanted a box. I hit the server call button and the server finally came so I could ask for a box. She dropped the check which I informed her I already paid. The next day I received a request to complete a survey. I filled it out and asked to be contacted by someone from the company.

72,Vedran V.,"Dixon, CA",129,341,153.0,3.0,2014-08-04,"This Red Robin used to be TGI Friday's back in the day so it is more spacious then some other locations of the popular burger chain. Most of the times there is no wait but the parking can take a while because there are businesses such as BJ's and Golden 1 in the same lot  I came here for lunch with a bunch of co-workers and they had no problems accommodating our group of 8 on a large table close to the TV. The service was prompt but not extraordinary by any means. We had to ask several times to get refill on their bottomless fries. If the fries are bottomless and there is a large group it would be expected to bring out more than two portions, furthermore since all of us had burgers that come with refillable fries. If this is something Red Robin prides itself on, they can clearly do better. Even being frugal does not really explain it.  For my meal I had a Burnin' Love burger, which comes with fried jalapeno rings, pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle aioi on a corn crusted kaiser bun. Sounds mouthwatering, doesn't it? Well, while the burger wasn't bad, and they got the patty temperature right, it still did not impress me. The bun was a little on the dry side and the heat level from jalapenos, pepper jack and chipotle aioli was barely noticeable. WIth these ingredients I was expecting the burger to be the bomb but it was only solid. As for the brews to go with that burger, the beer selection at Red Robin is not bad for Vacaville, a town that is clearly missing a place that carries decent taps. They had about 10 handles, but the best beers I could find were Sam Adams Rebel and Lagunitas IPA. Sad fact is that on the West Coast we need to have imitation of WestCoast IPA (yes Rebel) while there are so many IPAs brewed in the same area/County. Suggestion to Red Robin: how about carrying Heretic brews? It doesn't get much more local then that for quality beer in Solano County.  Red Robin was OK for a lunch with co-workers and no one left hungry. For more than a 3 star rating things should be somewhat outstanding and Red Robin did not deliver that level or food/drinks/service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=80,2.64,2.64,2.64,1.9320000000000002,2.64

First off let me say I like Red Robin, so when we decided to stop at this location, I was expecting the same awesome customer service. Boy was I wrong!!! When we first walked in, the hostess rudely ignored us. We stood there for at least a minute or two before she said how many? Then she proceeded to tell us there would be a 10 to 15 minute wait, which wouldn't have been an issue if they were super busy. But they weren't. So anyway we finally got seated at an empty table that had been empty the whole time. Shortly after a waitress rushingly says ""I'll be right with you"" as she walks on by. Then about 5 minutes later (probably a little longer), I guess the manager comes by (only because I said something loud enough for her to hear as she walked by) and says ""oh your waitress will be with you shortly. But in the meantime can I take your drink orders"" So I proceed to order our drinks. She brings them pretty quickly. Still haven't seen or met our waitress. The manager then saw me looking at the order tablet at the table and said ""did your waitress explain this to you?"" I said ""no we don't even know which one she is."" The manager or assistant manager (the same woman) then asks to take our food orders. We order. We have been there about 25 mins or so still waiting. Still haven't met our waitress even though everyone around us is being served and taken care of. Then at the hostess station the phone starts ringing. It literally rang for about 15 minutes. The hostess and another higher up both continued to ignore the ringing phone even though they could clearly hear it. Finally someone answers the phone. Annoying. Still have no idea who or where our waitress is. Suddenly after staring her down, low and behold I guess it was our waitress as she walked by she asked ""what kind of drink did you have?"" I'm thinking to myself, um and who are you? She never said hi, sorry I missed you or sorry for taking so long or even telling us her name. At that point I had it with the poor customer service. I get it that the manager was trying to help her but for whoever our waitress was supposed to be, to not ever even introduce her self at all or say anything to us ever is just rude. When you feel like your being treated poorly you lose your appetite. We asked to cancel the orders and said we would pay for the drinks we already drank. The manager was nice and said don't worry about it and sorry that we had a bad experience (something like that).

I ordered the black & bleu burger which is part of their new promotion for America's finest burgers or something. Super overpriced for what it is. The burger is 14.29 without tax, and I asked to sub their regular fries for their new herbed garlic fries, and got charged an additional $.99 even though my friend made the same sub (albeit on a different burger) and did not get charged for it. The burger was just okay, nothing special especially when I'm paying for what's supposed to be one of their ""premium"" burgers. Tried their raspberry cream soda (not bottomless) and they didn't even top up the glass with the soda all the way. Their version of the cream soda just seemed like regular raspberry Italian soda with whipped cream on top that you're supposed to stir in. For a drink that's almost $4 and not bottomless, I at least expect my glass to be topped up. Just my check was $20+ not including tip. For that price I would have rather gone to BJs, or better yet saved myself $12 and gone to chipotle. Splitting checks for 10 was super easy though so props to that.

We waited so long, my friends snagged a table and we ended up seating ourselves. Then we waited more to get a server's attention just so we could get menus. Instead of ordering off the actual menu, there's also ziosks where you can order food and drinks right from the table. But it's more convenient if you're paying with debit/credit card and be sure that the server activates it for you first.  Our drinks and appetizer of Onion rings came out quickly, but we waited again even longer for our burgers. I went with one of the new items, the Southern Charm Burger, consisting of a 1/2 lb Angus beef patty covered with melted cheddar cheese topped with applewood bacon and sautéed onions doused in barbecue sauce on a ciabatta bun. Also came with their signature bottomless steak fries. Though it sounds and looked delicious on the menu, the burger wasn't anything too special.

Server only came by once after our drinks were delivered to ask if we needed anything during which we asked for some fries to hold us over until the food came.  Never got refills on our drinks until we asked.  Food was okay...we had the black & bleu burger, tavern burger (eh) and kid's cheeseburger. They've gotten skimpy on the bottomless fries.

56,Marc C.,"Union City, CA",43,18,1.0,1.0,2015-05-15,"***Do not visit this Red Robin...drive to Fairfield, trust me it's not worth going to this one*** So first off my poor review here stems from months ago. I have eaten at this chain multiple times, every time has been a poor experience. However, I understand that not all chains are perfect and there is always room for growth. The worst part of this chain is the excruciatingly slow service. I went in for lunch with my wife and son at 1:15pm on 5/15. It was not busy, most of the tables were empty with only 3 other parties seated. We got our menus and ordered from our server promptly after being seated. This was around 1:20pm. We ordered the zucchini sticks and jalapeño coin appetizer, 2 burgers, and a kids grilled chicken. We got our drinks shortly after, and this where the pain just dragged out. It was 1:40 and we still hadn't received our appetizers. Last time I checked, zucchini sticks and jalapeño coins do not take 20 minutes to cook. Upon receiving our app (from a different person by the way) I asked how long it would take for our burgers. The server said she'd check....never saw her again. 15 minutes pass and I finally catch our original server. I asked her to check on our food, and she came back with our food.  All good right?  Nope.  Instead what we got was one of the burgers cold and the grilled chicken wasn't cooked all the way. They served pink chicken to our 2 year old son. So at this point it's nearly 2pm when we get our food, roughly 40 minutes after ordering. I called the server to bring the manager out. Who we got was a manager on duty (not the general manager) who had just transferred in.  I explained that i had some major concerns with the wait time and showed him the pink chicken meat. At this point I didn't even bring up the cold burger, we were just hungry. He proceeded to tell me that one of the burgers can take up to 20 minutes to cook. Which is fine and all if it is what it is, but keep in mind we ordered 40 minutes prior and our apps alone took 20 minutes to cook. He took the kids meal back and removed the cost from our check. Meanwhile our son is still hungry because we didn't let him eat the undercooked chicken. Before we left, I talked to the manager on duty again and explained that this wasn't the first time I have had issues at this specific Red Robin. I'm even a regular at the chain he used to work at in Concord, which I have had no issues with. I told him he had his work cut out for him because this location has major issues, paid our bill, and left with out still hungry 2 year old son who wanted grilled chicken. -Extremely slow service on multiple visits -Cold Food -Undercooked Chicken Never again.  If you are considering going here, please just drive to Fairfield or another place to eat.

55,Michelle L.,"Sacramento, CA",795,718,4413.0,3.0,2015-06-05,"Caught Game 1 of the NBA Finals at Red Robin. Sat in the bar area, with good views of two TV screens, and ordered through the waitress, not the electronic tablet gadget thing. Started with one of the $5 appetizers, one of my weaknesses, the salted pretzel bites with cheese sauce. These came out good and hot, soft and not overdone. Beers came out fine, I also tried both the peach and raspberry flavored iced teas -- too sweet and artificial, but if I had to choose one over the other I'd go with the peach. Main orders were the Bacon Cheeseburger ($10.49) with cheddar cheese, some pink, and the garlic herbed steak fries ($0.99 extra), and the Black & Bleu burger ($14.29) off the ""Finest"" menu, some pink, with sweet potato fries ($1.49 extra). For dessert we tried the short (4 instead of 8) tower of Doh! Rings ($5.99) -- basically RR's version of cronuts, which came with a fudge sauce and a berry sauce to dip them in.  The bacon on my burger wasn't crispy or anything, and the herbed streak fries look like they were just seasoned with garlic salt with some chopped parsley; I was expecting real garlic. This part of my meal wasn't that spectacular. My bf had the Black & Bleu burger, which comes with blackened sauteed portobellos, caramelized onion, bleu cheese sauce/crumble and dijon on ciabatta. The sweet potato fries are also cut skinny; why can' they make sweet potato steak fries too? In my opinion, for a bleu cheese fix, save your $3.50 and just get the Bleu Ribbon burger ($10.79) off the ""Gourmet"" menu. That comes with steak sauce, chipotle aioli, bleu cheese and onion straws on an onion bun. As for the ""bottomless"" fries aspect, neither of us ordered regular steak fries to begin with, but the second basket they brought to our table was just the ordinary seasoned steak fries. Oh well. The refill on beer took awhile too. The dessert was an afterthought, but since it was close enough to National Donut Day and cronuts are the ""in"" thing we got a half order to share. The presentation reminds me of a paper towel dispenser. The plastic cups with the sauce were not wide enough to really dip the donuts in easily. I did prefer the berry sauce over the chocolate. Covered in sugar, they did have some of the layering inside like a croissant and were okay. I've had other cronuts, as well as funnel sticks, donuts, etc. with the same idea before.  Service overall was okay. Bathroom floors were a litle sticky but otherwise well-stocked/maintained. Parking can be difficult since the lot is shared with BJ's and the Golden 1, otherwise easy to get back on I-80.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=40,2.2,2.41,2.41,2.284,2.3260000000000005

Unfortunately, our food adventure did not get that far. Upon entering through the two, double-door entryway, we were immediately in line. Not that there was many people. There were three to be exact and then another four that came in behind us. From the doorway to the front counter is about seven steps away, so not much room to congregate comfortably. To the left there is a red, cushioned bench to rest your wearing bones....from waiting for a RIDICULOUS amount of time!! That's right! The wife and I entered the restaurant and waited to be greeted. Yes, that is normal for any place you go to BUT we waited, along with the others, for more than the standard wait time. What is the standard wait time you may ask? I do not know but I am pretty sure you don't have to wait awkwardly for more than three minutes--to be noticed! Multiple waitress walked by all of us w/o any type of greeting, almost avoiding any eye contact. On Sunday, December 5, the wifey and I decided to try the eatery one more time...hoping for the best. Unfortunately, we were let down AGAIN!! The only difference, we did not stand around waiting as long as the first time, hoping to be noticed.   I just cannot figure out why no staff acknowledged our presence on BOTH days. Customer service was lacking significantly!

Not busy at all and ample bar seating available. Atmosphere is everything to me and the first thing I notice is all the overhead bar lighting was off. Asked about it and told a circuit blew. Second thing I noticed was how frigid cold it was?! Really? Had to stay bundled up the whole time. Asked to warm it up, but couldn't really tell. The one bonus about this place? NO KIDS PERMITTED IN THE BAR AREA! Thank you.  Since this was more of a appetizer and cocktails visit we started with pretzel bites and the mini tower onion rings. These were both fantastic; although the dippers that accompanied them could use a little work. Ranch dressing in a plastic cup just isn't winning me over.  We ordered the fish and chips entrée to share. The kitchen staff was kind enough to split and plate it separately for us. It was actually executed quite well. We opted for the free refill on fries as they were delish and also bottomless.  Mini towering doh rings. Again, the dough rings were perfect but the dippers need some work. They have a very pre made and artificial taste as though they came from a can or jar.  Surrounded by nice high def televisions at the bar.  Need a better variety of sports on the screens. I saw 6 around the bar all playing basketball (the same channel) at a time when NHL is mid season with tons of games and the PGA is in Pebble Beach. Get some variety up there please.

The values they use to have were amazing, now it seems as tho they could careless about their guest. I went out to eat with my 4 year old son, we stood at the host stand for about 10 minutes waiting for a host to come up. She finally came up and said she would need to clean off a table, no biggie I get it. Took another 10 minutes and we finally got sat. We eventually for greeted by a guy after sitting for 15 minutes, took our order . We got our drinks .. My son had to go to the bathroom .. At 4 year old he still requires my company. So we got up and walked to the restroom .. We were probably gone about 5 minutes and came back to our table bussed. I was upset about that but whatever, they got us our drinks again and our food finally arrived.. It tasted horrible but hey it's food. I let the waiter know i was upset that our table had gotten cleaned within 5 minutes of not being there and he replied ""I figured you just left"". Now a sorry would have been IMO a better thing to say, or to even possible have the manager stop by the table to check on things.  I use to love red robin, the food & atmosphere .

81,Anne L.,"Fairfield, CA",7,45,19.0,1.0,2016-03-23,"Went to Red Robin's last night because my daughter chose the restaurant.  We came in at the end of the rush.  The couple behind us was dealing with the manager.  The woman's food was wrong and the french fries were in a petrified state. We were advised our server was only the second day of this job.  Normally, not an issue.  However, if you're going to train new servers, teaching them to refill drinks and removing appetizer plates is part of the process.  In my opinion, having 20+ years in hospitality, she needed to be supervised more or limited on her tables until she wasn't as flustered. We placed our order and it literally took at least 45 minutes.  Our waitress avoided our table completely.  My husband requested to speak with the manager after we witnessed another table receive their food and they had been seated only 15 minutes prior to ordering.  Our waitress chose that time to let us know they were ""putting our food together"".  We pointed out the other table, seated after us (by about 30 minutes) was already eating but they were still ""putting our together""?  She went back into the kitchen.   About five minutes later our food was brought out by the kitchen supervisor.  When I asked if he was the manager, which is whom we requested to speak with, he confirmed he was.  He wasn't.  He was a shift supervisor.  When asked why the other table only recently sat down and were already eating, while ours was just being delivered; he couldn't respond.  When I asked what the ticket time on our order was, he sputtered some ""uhs"" and said he didn't know, but it had been awhile.  He downplayed the entire issue and said, ""well, you're food's here now"".  Yea, because that makes it all better. Let's see, my daughter's order was wrong.  We had taken onions and mayo off her burger but it contained both.  My burger was warm but the extra-cost, sweet potato fries were lukewarm, at best and my husband's burger was cold. We sent it back, asking for our bill and the actual manager.  She took her sweet time coming to our table.  Since she came from the kitchen, it's likely she received a recounting of her supervisor's experience with us.  She came out, is an ultra quiet voice.  She wanted to make it ""right"".  However, it was 8:00 p.m., we still hadn't eaten and there was no way we were going to eat there.  When we pointed out the other table that received prompt service, she said, she was addressing our issue now.  She tried to tell me at Red Robin's ""manager"" and ""shift supervisor"" are interchangeable.  That simply is not true.  Managers are above a supervisor because they have more authority.  Obviously, by the could-care-less attitude from the kitchen supervisor, he clearly wasn't manager material. The manager, Rebecca, continued to talk in ""soothing tones"" like they teach you in nursing and psychology.   We asked for our bill and she said she'd take care of it.  She never let us finish a complete thought without interrupting and trying to keep the calm.  This irritated my husband to no end and he swore a couple times.  She had the nerve to tell him she'd have to ask him to leave if he continued that.  Seriously, we already told her we were leaving! We asked for her GSM's contact information.  She didn't know what a GSM (General Service Manager) was.  They had a regional manager, Brett, and she gave me his number.  I called and left a message as soon as we left, about 8:15 p.m.  The call was sent to voicemail.  I received a  call this morning from the same number, but it went to my voicemail (I was working).  There was no message left and when I returned the call, it went to voicemail again.  I have yet to hear from this Regional Manager. Overall, it was the worst experience we've ever had there.  They aren't stellar by any means, but this was absolutely ridiculous.  Customer service is a concept that is obviously foreign to that particular store.  The management is in desperate need of retraining.  When servers can be heard discussing why people are getting cut before them, and they've been there over 10 hours, it's not a good environment for anyone to be in. Save you're money...avoid this store.  Fuddruckers in Fairfield, CA is a better option and faster service! UPDATE (4/1/16):  It was nice of Red Robin to ignore the fact I asked to speak to someone above the Vacaville Regional Manager.  They were nice enough to email me, in attempts to not having to speak with me, to let me know they sent me a $20 gift card.  Awesome!  Yeah...no it's not.  I mentioned I would never be back but I wanted to speak with someone.  I called their corporate office again, requested my case be escalated, again, to have someone call me.  After all, last week I was promised someone from Red Robin would call me by Monday or Tuesday of this week.  That didn't happen either.

We asked for refill of fries and got them 45 minutes later 4. We NEVER got water we asked for 5. My son asked for a refill on his chocolate milk and was told there wasn't refills on milk. We ask the manager to show us where it says that...it didnt! Then we ask to speak to the manager and he comes and apologizes for the service and we think great that was nice. He offers to take off the kids meal and one simple burger. We were fine with that....Then he goes on to say he will take care of dessert if we all want to get something. The bill comes out and he didn't waive anything. We ask the waitress to call the manager again...he comes out and says I didn't tell you I would take care of milkshakes. I said I would take care of dessert. Milkshakes aren't a dessert they can be eaten with a burger. WTF? Daniel was the MID manager we were dealing with and Ashley was our waitress!!!!

29,Sandy M.,"Vallejo, CA",5,25,11.0,1.0,2017-06-30,"This review is on the workers at the restaurant and RED ROBIN Corporate office and not the food. The food was excellent. I ACCIDENTALLY forgot my eye glasses that were on the table. I know, how dare i forget my eyeglasses!! When i realized my error and called back to the restaurant the person on the phone described them to me right down to the brand name and the case!  ALRIGHT, my glasses are still there! I was in a car accident and couldn't go back for them for 2 weeks. When I called the 2nd time I was told my case was missing but my eyeglasses were there right down to the name brand that they were. Well, thats something I think to myself. I am told that my eyeglasses will be kept in the mangers office for safe keeping. Thank you very much I say. When I go pick them up, to my dismay I find out that my eyeglasses are completely gone! Sorry! I called up corporate that same hour and I talk to Daisy who calls the restaurant and gets the same story I told. She says she cant think of any else but they were taken and will escalate this matter.  Give it 48 hours and someone will call me. No surprise no one calls. I call up today and talk to DEB in the corporate office.  I am upset about this and NONE OF THE INFORMATION I have given prior to daisy is on the system, EXCEPT a case number. DEB starts asking me for all this information I really didn't have at my fingertips. She says she will wait while I go find it. I say I dont have it readily available and it will take some time to find.   She presses me on the information while asking me to keep my tone in check. I tell her I am upset that NONE of the prior information is in the system and I feel like I have been taken for a SECOND RIDE. I say I need to hang up as I am getting really mad. DEB keeps saying Im trying to help but your being uncooperative in a very condescending tone  and finally I say  I will call her back as her condescending tone was getting on my last nerve.  And she doesn't want to let me off the phone but will if it makes me happy. I hang up! I go to breathe and take a few minutes before calling back and she calls me first. She tells me she called the restaurant and talked to the manager COURTNEY who claims I never left my glasses there, ever! Then DEB says, Sandy can I give you a few gentle suggestions about your glasses because you've lost them and you never left them at our restaurant.  I insist yes I did leave them there and it was verified twice that I did. I recanted the day and events that happened while I there the day, the time, the drunk woman at the bar bothering people that the bar tender finally cut off, and her husband being upset with her and blah blah blah. DEB state saying Sandy you lost your glasses somewhere else. You never had them in our store.  Here are a few GENTLE SUGGESTIONS for remembering where you keep things.  I told DEB if she said that to me one more time I was hanging up because I did leave them there and they were confirmed there and I don't appreciate this crap and she started again with her gentle suggestions and I hung up on her. I have called a different corporate number and will hope that I get some satisfaction from that call. BTW, the cost of the glasses was $35.00! Over the counter Foster Grants tri focal glasses.

The food wasn't anything special. My son loved his tavern burger but everything else wasn't anything well enough to give mention to. While taking my daughter to the restroom I was appalled by the state of the bathroom. Most of the stalls were out of things and the available toilet paper was just sitting around on whatever available surface. The toilet paper dispenser didn't even look like it could hold a roll.

I told them I would like it cooked medium with pink and the burger I received was way over cooked and very dry with the cheese not even melted. I also had to order two drinks for the special, I ordered the strawberry lemonade without knowing I was going to pay $10 for two lemonades with rotten strawberries on the bottom. When I went to pick it up they took forever to even acknowledge why I was there and proceeded to bring out parts of my order at a time. Basically they are false advertising, understaffed and the cooks need to learn that burnt isn't medium but what do I know. The only thing that was semi ok was the simply grilled salad that they didn't even ask what dressing I wanted with it and assumed I would like ranch.

18,Steve H.,"Vacaville, CA",0,17,2.0,1.0,2017-10-13,"Went here with extended family. After ordering fish and chips, waitress came back a few minutes later and said they were out. No problem. Ordered one of the specialty burgers. Our order ended up being placed about five minutes after the rest of the party. Order received after the rest of our party was done eating. Cold sweet potato fries. The burger left a bad taste in my mouth. As I was about to mention this to my wife, she turned to me and told me she had a nasty taste in her mouth. For some reason, the bacon on our burger seemed to have a slight taste of fish and onion. We ordered the burger without onion. We would have complained, but the waitress simply did not appear. We won't be back, nor will the two families that were with us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3,2.12,2.25,2.36,,2.1980000000000004

17,C.Z P.,"Vacaville, CA",3,29,25.0,2.0,2017-10-23,"We came here last night to grab burgers before a movie with our girls - it was about 5:20 and we had plenty of time before the movie started... We were hesitant to go here to be honest because the last few times have been uninspiring to say the least.  Even the food hasn't been that great. BUT we are always willing to give another try and go back for a 2nd, 3rd chance. We walked in and it seemed empty, maybe 4 people in the bar area, an empty small dining room to the right and only the center dining room to the left had diners.  We figured we would get right in.  However we did notice a couple of people waiting.  One gal finally asked us how many and as she scoured her ipad or whatever she said it could be about 15-20 minutes.  I was like ok, well there must more more business in the back that we can't see. As we were waiting I went to the restroom, which takes you through the bar and then I noticed just how empty and understaffed they were.  Also sadly the bathrooms were gross :( if you're that slow the bathrooms should be kept and I won't go into detail what was in the stalls. I walked back through the other side of the bar and looked into the dining room and was shocked there was a wait at all, there were empty tables and honestly not that many people to begin with.  My conclusion is they're highly understaffed because of traffic and what not.  Sadly when you understaff the experience will still be terrible.   We ended up waiting longer than 15 minutes so we sent our girls across the street to BJ's and they were packed but able to seat us immediately.  It's called adequately staffed.   Not sure we will ever go back here again :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3,2.0,2.31,2.36,,2.1860000000000004

I just Retired from the Chair Force and this is my first Veteran's Day. I regret eating here and here are the following reasons why: 1. Napkins, spoons and forks was not provided. My daughters have to use their hands and I have to get napkins from the restroom. 2. I ordered 3 Basket if fries including ranch. I asked 3 times but only got 1 basket and no ranch at all.  3. The side was incorrect and the quality of the food was different. For the positive, my waiter was over whelmed. He tried but it seems he had memory lapse which is understandable. I don't think I'll be eating here for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3,2.0,2.36,2.36,,2.216

They offer gluten free buns which is huge for someone like me who has certain allergies to gluten. The place is a fair size, comfortable booths, friendly staff (sometimes they screw things up). Recommend the bacon cheeseburger for someone who wants to take it simple. They have a version of the standard Croque-Madame, one of their most famous burgers, that I also recommend.  Solid 4 stars, keep it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3,2.12,2.39,2.368,,2.2820000000000005

And there was a piece of lettuce on my plate. My friends burger bun was super cold.  Plus I saw a waitress bring out someone's food and the bowl had lettuce all on the outside! Waitress asked how everything was and I said not good. She came back to inquiry why, told her we don't usually complain and let her know. We just got a refill on fries better this time. (Mind you they are unlimited fries) Nothing came of it so we paid and left! Sad, Red Robin is known for burgers and fries and yet they missed the mark here. And even worse establishment doesn't care for presentation or food.  I would give 2 stars but margarita drink was good.

Had the Siracha burger ( not at all spicy ) with the garlic fries ($1.29 extra ). Food was good and so was the service. Our server was Robby who was very attentive. Reason for 4 stars because the garlic fries did not at all have anywhere near enough garlic. It was site full of "" garlic oil "" but that's it. Waste of the extra money.
