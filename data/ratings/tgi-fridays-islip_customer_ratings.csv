The meal was mediocre at best, the chicken on my salad basically inedible, the toast fairly stale. After they swiped my card but before I signed the check, I got to the bottom of the cup and there was a SHRIMP TAIL IN MY COFFEE.  I immediately called over a manager and asked if I could get the meal comped. Instead, he returned, and I had gotten the coffee free, and some appetizer cards. I told him I did not want the app cards, he's lucky I'm not allergic to shrimp and I would not pay for the meal. He said they had already swiped the card and there was nothing he could do.

Although failure is likely imminent; I look forward to the challenge. As I mentioned, I got the black bean burger, for I am a vegetarian currently (but I do have occasional ""meat-cheat"" days). I also opted for the side of french fries, which were of course topped with spicy brown mustard.  The burger has corn and some other stuff inside - all deliciousness incarnate.  The atmosphere is pretty standard for TGIF's, friendly waitress that was attentive to her customers. No rush (then again there was no waiting line) even though I stayed for about 30 minutes after I finished my meal to wrap up some paperwork while on the road.

I guess what I am saying is that when you go to Friday's you know what you're getting.  Seems they are all the same these days.  Right about 3 stars.

The menu I was given does not state the appetizer is excluded. The waitress takes my order (not saying it is excluded) and my bill comes with the full price.

The service is horrible and the employees just the same. Everytime I dine here it takes forever to be served. My appetizers come with my meal and mind you that my meal takes about 20 minutes to arrive (no dramatization). The employees are too carefree and irresponsible. Everything about this place SCREAMS unprofessional. I live around the area and there are three other TGI Friday's by me, so I usually go to the others except on those rare occasions that I go to this particular restaurant.  Whats amazing though, is that everyone I know hates this place as well. Everyone has the same complaints. The management in this place needs some serious wake up calls, as a matter of fact this place needs needs to go under new management. Its such a shame really.

4,Courtney M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",207,177,352.0,5.0,2016-04-07,"So, it's pretty surprising to me that I've never reviewed Friday's because of my intense, irrational love for Friday's. It's like, my go-to restaurant. I don't think I've ever been disappointed. Now I remember when Friday's was not the restaurant it is now and the menu was slightly simpler, the prices considerably less, and they had daily drink specials (except for on Fridays, of course) and despite not being crazy about all the alterations and the constantly changing menu, I still love it. ANYWAY, came here about two nights about with the fiancé, ordered the cajun chicken/shrimp pasta and the JD's flat iron with a side of crunchy shrimp, fries, and mac and cheese (gluttons, I know). It was really, really good. Steak was cooked just right, the pasta wasn't under-seasoned or incredibly spicy (it's always a toss up) but the mac and cheese is definitely lacking in the cheese department but for some reason, I don't mind. I also ordered a strawberry henny which I drank on an empty stomach and thoroughly enjoyed. I'm definitely here for all the new drinks. Service was standard, it was a little late and our waitress ended up going home after delivering our food so the bartender ended up taking our check. Obviously we tipped but as to who received the tip, that was a mystery. So, no complaints, had a great meal and thanks to my coupon from being a stripes member, I got the pasta for free so we didn't spend a whole bunch of money.

She finally comes over 15 minutes later, then I asked her for a side of ranch and a brownie dessert. She says sure. 15 minutes later no ranch, then comes with the brownie and apologizes for the wait.. so I just said can I get that ranch so I can just eat my app at home since it's cold now... we finish the dessert and she asks if we want anything else, we say just the check. Then she drops the check off, my boyfriend decides to go to the bar thinking he would get change faster, obviously that was a mistake.

I told our server this is the wrong sandwich and he came back out with the exact same plate and just put some jack Daniels sauce on it. I told him I didn't even want my meal anymore.

Service was poor - server repeatedly ignored us, ticket times were atrocious (over 30 minutes), food was brought out and our table still did not have any utensils or napkins, and probably would've never gotten any of those ""basics"" had I not said anything. Server never asked to refill our drinks or any of the ""common courtesy"" tasks you expect of a server (try to offer you more food, advertise specials, etc.).
