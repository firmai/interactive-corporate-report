4,Jon D.,"Olathe, KS",34,7,,4.0,2012-05-27,"We were there for lunch.  House Margarita is 2.99 all the time and not to shabby.  Food was tasty, service was excellent.  I'd give a 5 if there was a smaller portion/less expensive option for sandwiches/entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence?start=20,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998
19,Shawn B.,"Kansas City, MO",105,465,358.0,2.0,2012-07-17,"Not a good start, took 10 -15 minutes for server to take our order and the place is only half full.  I hate the menu at this place!  It's called Chili's but only has a couple of Fajita offerings, a couple of quesadilla choices (which are a rip-off) and a few tacos.  How about some mexican plates of some imagination?  I could satisfy a mexican craving much better at Taco Bell!   2 for $20 deal made me feel ripped off.  The fried cheesesticks my son ordered taste awful.  The little 6 oz petite sirloin I ordered actually tasted pretty good.  But that with my son's chicken finger dinner and freezer burned cheesesticks, and NO desert, hardly make it a deal. It had been over a year since I tried them last, won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
1,Kit H.,"Raymore, MO",0,5,,2.0,2013-01-02,Food was good but service was a little slow. My wife found old food floating in her  water (gross)!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence?start=20,,,,,
2,Maria P.,"Kansas City, MO",7,66,,5.0,2013-01-21,"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at Chili's. It's probably because I get the same thing every time and will never get anything else. The Skillet Queso is to die for. Mango tea is the bomb. And the Grilled Chicken Carribean Salad with no peppers, cilantro, or green onion, is the best salad in the world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence?start=20,,,,,
24,Eric J.,"Blue Springs, MO",9,16,1.0,5.0,2014-03-30,"Back once again. Got a new server this time, Jordan, and he was damn good for being new. Love breakin in the newbs. I make it pretty easy though, with my serving/bartending experience. But seriously, He killed it. Great speed, very attentive, very efficient, very nice. Well done, Jordan. Meal was great too. Came with my fiance and our 2 month old baby boy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
14,Reed N.,"Kansas City, MO",116,1642,121.0,4.0,2014-05-19,"Where can you get a decently prepared filet of salmon, a half rack of dry rub ribs, broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes for 17.99??? The answer is probably nowhere else but here! I have always liked the Chilis franchise. There are some menu items with decent flavor and they have always offered some healthy selections as well. And the margaritas aren't bad either. ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
23,Larry C.,"Independence, MO",1,10,,4.0,2014-11-23,"I see why people get the appetizers.   Didn't get any, and it took about twenty minutes for the food to come.  Old fashion hamburger was good for one of us and chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes was also good.  Interesting way to pay at the table.  We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
22,Chad S.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,6,,2.0,2014-12-08,ALWAYS SLOW SERVICE! The waitress is doing her best to keep us informed but this is the SLOWEST place to get food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
3,Theresa G.,"Kansas City, MO",0,37,,2.0,2015-01-01,"I go to Chili's a couple times a month, but I have never been more disappointed than I was yesterday.  I will say our server was a nice young man.  However, my son's tortilla shells for his fajita's were crispy, like they had been sitting out for a long time.  I love their Southwest Eggrolls and I eat them for a meal, usually not the entire serving.  However, this time they were about half the size as they usually are.  What really topped things was when I asked for my check I was asked if I was paying cash or credit.  I said credit and was told to pay on the little computer they have on the table!  Seriously, if I wanted self service I would have gone to a fast food restaurant.  I'm surprised he didn't tell me to order from the computer to begin with. Customer service is slowing disappearing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence?start=20,,,,,
0,Linda E.,"Grain Valley, MO",0,25,,2.0,2015-01-16,"Food is decent, service and seating is BAD! DONT come on  a weekend for sure and make sure Arial isn't the one seating people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence?start=20,,,,,
11,Rhonda S.,"Independence, MO",786,1010,914.0,1.0,2015-03-22,"Chili's deserves a 1/2 a star.  I went in to order to go, at the to go parking area. It is 10 minute limit. I went through the door, and a lady was at the counter. When I went in, she stared at me, and left. While I waited, I read the menu, and a few minutes later, a male employee walked past me, stared at me. ""I'd like to or...."" oops, he's gone. Another male employee walked by me, and I tried to catch him, ""I'd like to.."" Nope, he looked at me and ran to the kitchen.  Another female employee went to the cash register.I thought she was going to wait on me. She looked at me, and walked away. So, 15 minutes in parked in a 10 minute zone, and I left. But I have a bunch of stories about the Chili's. See, the  food is good.But the service is down right distasteful.  Once I went there with a friend and they served us food, but took a half an hour to bring us silverware. Stories like that representing horrible service. And tonight's experience added icing to the cake, or sauce to the enchilada I didn't get to order. Never again, Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
15,Hailey B.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",214,35,12.0,1.0,2015-05-17,Server failed to 2min check back on how the food was. We ordered the white queso dip. Attached is my plate after I picked up 2 chips. COVERED in salt. Ridiculous. Server never came around so we couldn't ask for new chips until she came to take the appetizers away as it was time for the meal. We told her the chips are salty and she had mentioned it being the end of the night all chips from the bottom of their batch are salty...it's 6PM. Shifts start around 4-5... You close at 9 or 10? It's not the end of the night.. Can you tell I'm a server yet?? Sucks here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
5,Lei C.,"Independence, MO",149,124,120.0,4.0,2015-06-16,"Seating time was impressive. They were busy during the dinner rush but managed to seat us in about 8 minutes.  Our hostess was knowledgable and friendly. Upon being seated she showed us the tablet (now placed at each table). Not only can you order food and drinks from it but it has several games on it, which kept my daughter entertained and happy. The waitress was nice and kept our drinks full. She got our somewhat complicated order right and even brought extras (lemons) that would compliment my dish. My ONLY complaint is how loud it was. Even my nearly 11 year old kept complaining to us about how it was making her head hurt. So while we liked the food and service, I think we'd be better suited going at a less busy time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
18,Susie D.,"Belton, MO",45,1,,2.0,2015-11-27,Took us 20 minutes just to get drinks. While people around us where already ordering. I got a Margarita that just taste like a lemon slushy and he got a top shelf long island that taste like water! Not very happy. But atleast the food was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
17,Teresa B.,"Independence, MO",0,8,,2.0,2016-02-04,"Torn between 2-3 stars as the food is usually pretty good. We have been regulars here for many years but the last 1 or 2 we have noticed a drop in the quality of food and service. We always go weeknights about 6 and sit at the bar.  Counters and menus are sticky. This evening we ordered and half an hour later were informed they were out of what we ordered.  We reordered. When our food came the tortillas and cheese were dry. The manager apologized and said he would discount our bill,OK. When the bill came he took $2 off. Really? I though that was insulting. Like leaving a waitress a quarter tip. There are too many other dining choices in that area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
21,Kasey S.,"Raymore, MO",0,18,5.0,1.0,2016-03-12,"Walked in and was told it would be a 10 minute wait.  There were empty tables available on the left of the dining area.  There was a crowd gathering in the waiting area by the front door and then the oddest thing happened.  A couple walked right past the hostess and sat down at a booth skipping the 10 minute wait.  We mentioned this to the hostess how unprofessional that was only to be told that the bar area was ""open seating"".  We left immediately and went to 54th street grill one block to the west.  After seeing the level of incompetence at the door was not willing to gamble with our lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
20,Russell P.,"Belton, MO",10,2,,2.0,2016-03-22,"The food was very delicious. The service was not, our waitress making many mistakes and leaving us well waiting. This left us at the chilis for about an hour without a check in by our server. This made us run to on the border for desert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
13,Christina K.,"Kansas City, MO",83,1,,1.0,2016-06-12,"Our service was slow and horrible. I've never been anywhere where you have to wait 10 minutes for some sauce. It started off wrong when they bring the wrong salad dressing. Our server was Brad. He's dropped stuff off out our table and hurry off before we can ask for anything else. We had to constantly look for him, which took another 10 minutes. We lost our appetite! It also took him another 15 minutes to get our check to us. No thank you! We won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
12,Brady K.,"Independence, MO",6,16,9.0,2.0,2016-06-25,"The food is prepared well, but the service is aweful. Saturday night 8pm at the bar and we see the bar tender about every 10 minutes.  Would have appeared to be the manager that brought the app, he was polite.  Bar tender used my table napkin to open my beer.  The ceiling is leaking something drip by drip behind the bar.  Ordered Coors light bottles and the beer expires in less than a month, guessing because of lack of beer sales.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
16,Kris N.,"Independence, MO",0,1,,1.0,2016-10-31,Terrible service! I ordered carry out and the server messed up my order. Ordered a steak and shrimp fajita but got a chicken and shrimp instead. The shrimp was RAW so I took it back and asked for a refund. Never going back. Avoid this place unless you want to get food poisoning!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
9,Scarlet F.,"Independence, MO",67,231,151.0,2.0,2017-05-24,I came in and asked for a quesadilla and two tacos. You'd think I had asked them to butcher the cow out back for a fresh stake or perform surgery. It's a Mexican restaurant. You can make a quesadilla. You can make a taco. Put them on a plate together. It's not brain surgery.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
10,Jose U.,"Kansas City, MO",0,5,,2.0,2017-08-17,"Ordered Chicken Fried Steak, it was hard, dry definitely overcooked and salty to include the corn and mashed potatoes with gravy. Friendly server but not again on Chicken Fried Steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
8,Melissa T.,"Independence, MO",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-28,Terrible customer service. The place was disgusting and dirty and the management didn't give a rats ass that's our food was cold. Didn't compensate us either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
7,Ryan M.,"Grain Valley, MO",29,1,,2.0,2017-12-08,Ok I like being able to use my phone to alert me that a table is ready but I don't think staff know how to use it because you have a 45 minute wait and 12 tables open...kinda BS!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,,,,,
6,Alicia B.,"Lee's Summit, MO",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-19,I just had a cockroach crawl out from under my basket paper my fries were served in.  I would've rated a 0/5 but the app wouldn't allow me,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-independence,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
