Sonya M.,"Chicago, IL",107,384,343,3.0,2/3/2013,Guess everyone in St. Charles is in bed by midnight because this location was dead as a door nail when I stopped in early one Sunday morning. There was one server on duty & the bartender. Don't recall their names but they super friendly & gave prompt service. I had the tiki torch Margarita & a the balsamic chicken Ceasar salad. The Margarita was awesome! The bartender on duty was obviously good at her job. Can't say I was in love with the salad but that had more to do with the twist with the dressing & less to do with the freshness or taste.  The brownie was good too but a little too rich for my liking.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
John S.,"Aurora, IL",126,438,5,2.0,7/8/2013,Lets face it Fridays is what it is. Food here isn't great or freshly made but you know what you are getting. If it wasn't for the pick two deals I wouldn't bother eating here at all. They charge $7 for a order of mediocre cheese stix which is just crazy for what you get. However the pick 2 for $10 is a great deal. Can get a burger and cheese stix for $10. Crazy to not get the burger for the extra $3. Food at this location is ok and about the same as any other Fridays.  My boyfriend ordered a steak rare and it came well done. Our server was very friendly and had no problems taking it back. Service at this location was much better then other Fridays I have been to. Over all if in the area and have to have Fridays food this location has great service. From a food standpoint you are better off at most other restaurants...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Rita B.,"Schaumburg, IL",22,150,31,1.0,9/12/2012,"This has got to be the WORST Friday's I've ever been to. I should have kept driving past the empty parking lot but decided that since I love Fridays it couldn't be so bad. Boy, I was wrong! Our server was horrible. She was rushed and kind of rude. She's not even my issue...the food is the issue.  Food was overcooked, tripled fried, cold, gross and had no taste/flavor. Mom had to send her burger back because it wasn't cooked well. The second burger was over-cooked and seasoned with so much salt and pepper that she had to scrape it off with a knife. Neither one of us was able to eat our dishes. Best part was that we still got charged for it after complaining. It has to be really bad in order for me to complain so this should give you an idea why the restaurant was empty.  Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to this location ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Kevin S.,"Winfield, IL",44,178,127,2.0,10/11/2014,"Why do they advertise endless apps by you can't share? Also I got sick from the buffalo wings, which ruined my girlfriend and I planned date-night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Mark L.,"St. Charles, IL",8,8,17,4.0,3/19/2014,"We go weekly, service is always good, manager is friendly.. Food is always hot and plenty of it on your plate.. Well run, with no bar brats hanging around being noisy . Good place to watch a hockey game, baseball and football, be nice at times if you could here the play by play, but the volume is always off. Bar service is good, and food comes out fast every time.. Best Fridays we've been to, nice to have it in our back yard..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Christian H.,"South Elgin, IL",4,16,4,3.0,5/25/2014,Great buffalo wings! There food is fairly decent and the restaurant environment is very family oriented and a great place for group event!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Brent A.,"West Chicago, IL",89,137,71,3.0,11/21/2013,Fridays seems to have slipped a bit since I have had dinner here last.  Both my steak and my daughters were cooked til completely gray while ordered medium rare.   They did re cook them. Much better the second time? But it took a long time. My dad was done with his dinner before I got mine right.  I know mistakes happen but if you screwed up the first time can you at least put a rush on the re order   The waitress was a bit slow too and didn't bring or offer a glass for my dad's bottle of beer.  When we asked for a glass she came back and said they are out of glasses right now.  Really?   The lat few times I have been here was for appetizers at the bar and that was good.  So maybe Fridays needs to stick to drinks and apps and let the dinner people go elsewhere,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Joseph P.,"Saint Charles, IL",4,74,2,4.0,7/25/2013,We have gone here several times and always enjoyed it. Food is always good and the service is great. Went today and our server Chris and the manager treated us very well! We would recommend this place and we plan on going again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Dino L.,"West Chicago, IL",2,16,,5.0,1/27/2012,We have always had a pleasant visit at this Fridays.  All of the staff has been friendly and the food is very good.  Amanda was our server and she was very friendly and polite.  We'll definitely visit here again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Chris E.,"Elgin, IL",88,40,1,4.0,9/9/2011,"We where seated right away. All the staff was very friendly. Apparently our server had been having some sort of problem so there was a second waitress helping take care of our table which was odd but they where all very friendly and all of the orders came out correct so I cant really complain. I had the petite sirloin (cooked medium) with jasmine rice and salad. everything was good, but the steak was awesome. A lot of places over cook medium when I ask for it but this was perfect and it came with a little pad of a butter sauce on top! mmmm it was so juicy and good! I would highly recommend it. If you do order it keep in mind the petite is very small though. The brownie obsession is also really good for dessert, the only thing I would recommend is them making the brownie warmer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Comensal A.,"Chicago, IL",0,366,,3.0,4/4/2012,"We visited Friday's for a family lunch. Each of the 3 generations found something tasty. We were in a booth and the noise was tolerable. Our server, Kerry, had just the right vibe to deal with everyone. The menu has enough variety for timid diners and sophisticates alike, the wine list is nice, and the prices are reasonable. A nice place for a variety of tastes...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
Johnny A.,"Saint Charles, IL",74,223,39,1.0,11/6/2009,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ST. CHARLES, IL FRIDAY'S: The little stuff: - Menu changes. Baked potatos - gone.  - Prices have skyrocketed, with LESS portions.  Nacho plate - you now get 2 LESS and its $2 more? - Crap shoot service. You may get good service, you may get poor service.  Now, the main enchilada: - FIGHTS. Since it opened in Oct 2002, I personally have seen 3 bar area arguments/fights predicated on what I will describe below. Now, this is 3 times that I happened to be there on occasion, no telling how many other times.  This is a family restaurant, not some redneck bar or a teeny bopper club like Zero Gravity.   Some bartenders here ""overserve"" drunk customers (to 'maximize TIP MONEY' -- despite the universal, common-sense 'cut off' rule that any good bartender knows), I have seen this with my own eyes. One time as mentioned above, some guy was WASTED along with his 7 friends - must have been some birthday gathering or something. Me and my party of two other guys were sitting 3 feet away, NOT DRINKING, just having dinner. When this drunk guy bumped me and then proceeded to sneeze my direction - in my food - 3 SEPERATE TIMES, I'd had enough. Some words came out of our mouths and before you know it, all of us were standing and in each other's faces and a brawl almost happened.  Now keep in mind this was 8 of them vs. 3 of us. They had a few female friends with them too and it was painly obvious they were trying to act 'loud and tough for the chicks.' This guy was about 5'5 130lbs. and he was drunk-barking curse words and threats while seven of his friends stood behind him yelling crap and 'talking with their hands' like g-moneys.  Parts of the confrontation then spilled outside!    HERES MY POINT- the manager on duty took roughly 5 MINUTES to determine there was a problem, and then step in.  People casually dining (some senior citizens!) were all interrupted and watching all of this commotion take place! The ""manager"" was sitting at the other end of the restaurant, flirting with a few other ""just got off their shift"" waitresses at another table. Any good manager would have been to the problem in no more than about 20 seconds.  I could run from one side of the restaurant to the other in literally about 6 seconds... The manager was REAL quick to throw us all out, and wait for their party to leave seperately, (then ours a few minutes AFTER them) because he knew had something happened, either damage to anybody or within the restaurant itself, or even at some other parking lot or location, Friday's in the long run would be held partially liable for continuing to serve already drunk people, and the manager KNEW THAT full well.  The next day, me and my party made formal complaints to Friday's Corporate.  After seeing copies of our receipts and hearing our side of the story, corporate sent us their apologies, and some $15 gift certificates. HERE'S KICKER # 2:  A few weeks later, I was in the restaurant 'picking up' food.  Someone behind the bar must have recognized me - perhaps the po'd bar waitress who was there the night of the fight, still angry her tip money abruptly evaporated once her huge party of drunk idiots were ejected - and went and told the manager (* note - some 'NEW' manager this time - was the other guy was fired?) who came up to me and stated he had heard that ""I was the culprit"" of some big fight a few weeks back and that ""his wait staff felt uncomfortable with me being there"" (a total lie - but this is the restaurant resorting to the obvious 'damage control' posture) and he asked me to leave the restaurant. Also note this was about 1pm - I was the only one in the pick-up area, and the restaurant was actually empty at this juncture - so I highly doubt I was truly 'scaring any wait-staff' (rolls eyes - how ridiculous!). It was CLEAR the restaurant and certain staff were TICKED OFF from recently having been reported to Friday's Corporate.  I guess if some drunk fool sneezes in your food 3 times, you are just supposed to smile, shake hands and continue eating. I stated very professionally ""I am here getting take-out, not causing any disturbances, and I wasn't about to explain the facts of what really happened because A. HE WASN'T EVEN THERE THAT EVENING, and B. He had clearly been misinformed by his waitress, BUT, if he wanted to remove me, he was welcome to call the police on me.""  He didn't know what to say, so he just walked away.  I continued to stand by the bar counter and wait for my order. I got my food with no further problems and left.  I doubt he called the police (I could just see cops coming and asking what was up, and seeing just a regular customer ordering take-out). I contacted Friday's Corporate about THIS incident as well. (** Friday's Corporate gave us gift cards to use at 'FRIDAY'S', right?) ** Restaurant has shut down as of October 2014. Given their continuous rising prices as well as how the restaurant was run as evidenced above, I can't say I am surprised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-saint-charles
