Junie J.,"Lacey, WA",0,15,,1.0,1/6/2018,I went here for lunch on New Years eve. Food was good but I never got the campfire sauce I asked for. Not really a big deal but still irritating.Our waitress was very unattentive. Apparently her friends were at the next table and she was more interested in visiting with them than doing her job. Also there were waitresses all around the restaurant doing their makeup. This is the third time in a row i've had shitty service here. I won't be back.

Daisy S.,"Olympia, WA",363,7,,1.0,10/29/2017,"It was my birthday and I called in to order my free birthday burger! When I came to pick it up they wouldn't give it to me for free because I hadn't made an account already. I offered to make one on the spot but they said it takes 24 hours to process. I spoke to the manager, Cody, who was very kind but wouldn't budge on the burger and was trying to make me pay $15 for the burger even though I was alone on my birthday and I kind of started crying a little bit :( A nice stranger stepped up and bought it for me, but I can't believe they would rather throw out food and send me away on my DAY OF BIRTH all sad instead of sacrificing 15 of their corporate dollars.

Kate C.,"Seattle, WA",48,82,51,2.0,4/13/2017,"I normally avoid places with poor ratings but I thought, ""It's Red Robin... how bad could it really be?"" Well, not great.  Firstly, I love technology. And the instant gratification of ordering from a device at the table could be cool, but it's just not yet. All the items aren't listed on there, and you need a menu anyway. The only button that's worth having is ""Call Server,"" which we had to do several times in our 40 minutes here. Good things: Our waitress was nice, we got our food quickly. The food was good. Bad: I know this isn't a bar, but we ordered mojitos that were terrible and tasted like sprite with no alcohol. My friend couldn't even drink hers, but with the inability to find a server or someone to talk to, we just wanted to pay and leave because it was getting annoying waiting. We were checked on once, but that was it... like I said the drinks were awful.. I had to track someone down to find boxes (plural... we were brought one... then had to go ask again for another), asked for a lid for some sauce twice... overall just kind of served our food and left to fend for ourselves. I did notice that they saw our full drinks but didn't ask again how it was or if we could get something different or a refund.  The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the food was good. I hate giving terrible reviews, but we won't be back to this location. They need to get a better system worked out of either order everything from a device & fend for yourself, or actually have a human heck on you and make you feel like it's worth spending your money at their restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia

Waitress took 5 minutes to address us with I'll be back in ""a second"" to bring our place settings. 8 minutes later comes back to take our drink order. I asked about the free birthday burger, But she denied it because we did register or exchange student on our loyalty card 24hrs before coming to the restaurant.  Then we all were going to order Monster shakes, but she told us that they are out of milk and therefore out of shakes. ""There is a Safeway across the street!"" How does a restaurant known for their shakes run out of shakes? So we disappointingly ordered sodas. Then we attempted to order an appetizer, but again we were told they were out of the appetizer. We had to leave and go to another restaurant to get our birthday girl her shake and burger.

Sadly our waitress (Leighton ) has moved to a different restaurant but the other servers are just as attentive and friendly. We started regularly attending this location back 3 years ago sometimes 2-3 times per week. We would only go on nights that Leighton worked and we would sometimes wait quite a while if there were no available tables in her section.

Rick K.,"Cathedral City, CA",1,29,12,1.0,4/13/2017,Worried that Red Robin is going down hill! We frequent this place at least one or more times per week. Ordered the salmon meal with broccoli but swapped  out the coleslaw. First of all plate was very hot so the salad was warm and wilted. The broccoli was brown on the ends and didn't taste very good. I asked our server if I could have fries instead of the broccoli because it wasn't good. ( not sure why they served the brown broccoli in the first place.) I then noticed that our server charged us $199 for the fries. So I talked to the manager and she said she would take care of it. So the server had to come over and tell us that she charged us because we shared them. WOW! Since when at Red Robin do people not share their fries?! (Btw the table behind us got 2-rounds of fries with each person getting their own basket plus the fries that come with their meal initially.) not sure why our server had to come over to explain anything anyway? This experience did not bode well with us! Thinking twice on wether we will be back anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia

Kevin was our waiter and he made sure the drinks were full, we had enough fries and everyone was happy. For a group of 10 this is no easy task and he handled it. Definitely was delivering GOLD STANDARD 5 star service. Cody, I believe was a manager, also came by to make sure everyone was doing well and happy with everything. I wish every place we ate paid attention to detail and cared about customer satisfaction as much as these guys.

When it came time to pay only half of my party was paying with card, so instead of splitting the bill she decided that she was going to wait for everyone who was paying with card till she finally gave us our bill.

I've been here twice, and the quality and the amount of food is less than what I'm normally used to at other RRs, but it will do for now.  My mojito was okay, could have used a bit more sugar and alcohol ;) but it was only $6.

Al G.,"Olympia, WA",0,5,,1.0,6/18/2016,"Prior to last night, I had never had an issue with Red Robin. My spouse and I decided to eat at Red Robin last night to celebrate. We ordered our food and our server verified our order. I let my sever know that I have a gluten allergy and specifically asked for a lettuce wrap. My server repeated my order with a lettuce wrap substituted for a bun. When my burger arrived, it was placed in a wheat bun. After trying to get my server's attention for over 10 minutes, she finally came over and asked if everything was okay. I told her I had a gluten allergy and asked for the entire burger to be remade. She apologized and took the burger back. After a few minutes, I was presented with a burger in a lettuce wrap. There were crumbs from the bun on the plate - the entire burger had not been remade. The cooks had simply but the burger in a lettuce wrap after I had specified I had a gluten allergy. I tried to get the attention of my server but was unable to for about another 10 minutes. Finally, when I got the attention of my server, I told her that the entire meal needed to be remade because of my gluten allergy. She took my meal away. After 30 minutes of waiting, my meal arrived. I had specifically asked for garlic alioli, as I knew that sauce was gluten free. The sauce on the burger was chipolte aioli, which I was uncertain was gluten free. I again had to wait 7 minutes to try and get the attention of my server before clarifying that the sauce was gluten free. The turkey burger was black and almost inedible because it was burnt, but at this point, I was so frustrated that I didn't care. When my spouse and I went to pay for the meal, we noticed that $20 was taken off the meal. The turkey burger and garlic fries were rung in twice and added an additional $2.75 to the meal. When I asked the server about why this was, she snapped that she had to ring the order in again to have the burger remade and her manager only took $20 off the tab. I asked her to please take off the additional $2.75, as I was not going to pay for a meal that I was unsatisfied with. My spouse and I paid in cash. Our server returned to our table with incorrect change. She gave us $2 instead of $2.06. Eating at Red Robin last night was supposed to be a special treat and celebration - and instead, it was a complete nightmare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=20
Lyn K.,"Olympia, WA",0,12,,2.0,4/10/2017,"Craving a good burger but was sorely disappointed!

The meat was petrified and I could hardly get it down it was so dry. The portabella mushrooms ( I counted 3 small slivers) and blue cheese sauce (could never locate it but there were 2 small pieces of blue cheese) added little to the flavor!

Zoe B.,"Seattle, WA",97,36,1,1.0,11/5/2016,"Nothing says ""Great American cuisine"" like nightmare inducing food poisoning. I've been to this location a hand full of times, mostly because they have a strong coupon game and it's an excuse to not cook sometimes. Normally I don't really look to deeply into the quality of chain restaurants, but tonight was a particularly horrible experience. I guess what should have tipped me off was that they won't let you order anything under medium well. Even Applebees let's you order a medium rare burger because they don't use frozen meats. Red Robin does apparently. Really poor quality frozen meat at that. That's really nasty. Secondly, the waiter kinda berated us into buying more food and drinks and told us to smile. In other words, annoying. He also refused to use a coupon that would have been valid and taken 50% off of one of our entrees, even though it was valid for my friend's entree. Instead he took off one of the drinks because he wanted us to stay and drink more.  All of that was pretty terrible, but the kicker was the all night gut cramps followed by an unpleasant morning of hellish evacuation. I'm still kinda sick.  This is not a good place for a burger.

I specifically asked for no tomato on my chicken sandwich. Their wasn't any tomatoes but they had been added and picked off (lots of seeds and juice attached to the bun).

Katrina T.,"Olympia, WA",0,3,,1.0,1/21/2017,"Terrible service! We are literally never returning to another Red Robin. Our server (Cody?) took at least 10 minutes to even get to our table and take our drink order, it was not busy, there were tons of servers on staff working in what appeared to be 4-5 table sections. The table across from us who also had the same server walked out since it was taking him so long to return for their food order. The table behind us had all sorts of issues with not receiving sides or the correct gluten free items they ordered. The hostess refilled our water and daugter's lemonade, another server delivered my boyfriend's beer, the expo or possibly a different server delivered our food, I don't know what our server was doing! My boyfriend managed to snag our server for a fry refill order we got no sooner than 20 minutes after placing it, which at the same time he brought me one as well but not the garlic fries I had originally ordered. We asked for more ranch when we ordered our refill fries, did not get it, from our server or the person who dropped off our fries, finally walked back to the kitchen service area to ask another server for a side of ranch.  Our food was decent, sub par US Foods or Food Service of America standard grub, delivered hot, typical Red Robin cuisine. The bathroom was clean. The hostess and all others staff were great, as we were promptly seated and primarily helped by everyone but our server who didn't even bring us silverware or napkins. The manager on duty who we left a complaint with on our way out was also very sweet and apologetic, not her fault! She checked in with us right after we placed our food order since our table top pad was dying and a previous guest had apparently left a cell phone behind they were searching for. We are fairly understanding people, one of us a small business owner and other a bartender with 14 years in the service industry but this was just ridiculous!

The ""16 ounce"" size is served in a 33cl/11.1oz glass. I can confirm they do, in fact, pull this scam. Apparently they have been doing this for at least several months. If you do the math, it equates to $2 per glass that you order and do not receive. If you have your receipt and are considering pursuing a resolution, please feel free to ask me about it.

The milkshake machine is on the back of the bar. You can hear the blades hitting the metal shake can, then the bartender literally bangs the can on the counter top about 8 times. After that she bangs the metal can on top of the glass that the shake is going into about 8 times. Has this place ever thought of using a spatula? Granted, bars are generally noisier than the rest of the restaurant but come on.  No one likes to hear that jack hammer type noise during lunch. Put the shake machine somewhere in the kitchen. Also, the same story about the fries. Never, never ask you if you want more fries until you've finished your entree. Not too good with a ""bottomless fries"" slogan.

We arrived around 6:00 on a Wednesday night.  We were sat at a booth and no one acknowledged us for over 10 minutes. I waved someone down to ask if we could get some drinks and was told our server would be with us.  About 5 minutes later a very sweet but inefficient server came over and said she would be with us in a few.  Fast forward 5 minues (20 min of sitting at a table with nothing in front of us).  She took our order and lets just say things went down hill from there.   Drinks took a long time to get there, we ordered an appetizer that came out 20 minutes later and 2 minutes before our main entrees. This always pisses me off. WHY call it an appetizer if you are serving it at the same time as an entree? They forgot my sons food, and after we asked about it, it took another 10 minutes and our food was luke warm waiting for our sons to arrive before we began eating. She forgot salad dressings, and charged me 79 cents  for sour cream for dipping fries into. What the  heck is that all about? They used to bring out a sour cream ranch mix that was free! We didnt have any napkins or silverware for a good 5 minutes into having our food.  No refills on any of our drinks, even though we asked. When I asked to speak to the manager he said they were swamped and that was why service was spotty. He acted as if this should be expected and was grumpy about it too. DID NOT OFFER AN APOLOGY.  He did comp my sons corndog (gee thanks - whatever).

My mom ordered the Cobb salad (which has hard boiled eggs on it) and was told by our server that there were no eggs. He explained that they had egg on site but those were only to be cooked for the burgers. their hard boiled eggs come already cooked and the place where they get them back in the Midwest had a bird issue and they had to slaughter over a million birds, (great ting to tell a customer before they eat a meal)  and corporate didn't want them cooking eggs for health reasons. .. but you just told us you have them to cook for burgers? When the salad did arrive (almost 45 min later) it was missing the chicken, we had to ask out server if it was missing and he brought it out on a separate plate.  I also had salad with my meal and I spent a good 5 minutes before I ate it picking out all the slimy lettuce, and when I say slimy i mean you can see through it slimy. I picked around it because we didn't have time to wait for another one. I asked for no cheese, and found a few shreds in my salad as well as melted under my chicken, not a big deal, but if I had been someone who was allergic it could have had a reaction. when our server checked in I explained all the things wrong and asked him to please notify the kitchen so other guests would not be affected, I do not remember receiving an apology and certainly no offer of compensation.

The burger wasn't great, it was really goopy with all the flavorless mayo and the VERY runny egg yolk. The sweet potato fries are good, but they upcharge $1.49 to get them instead of their regular fries, which is crazy for the small amount of fries you get.

When we arrived my 2 year old daughter really wanted a balloon because she normally gets one whenever we go to Red Robin. I told her that when we leave she can have one. As I was coming back from the bathroom near the end of our meal I observed they didn't have any more. My sister went to the front and asked if they had any more balloons and an employee stated they werent making any more for the night. It was 6 o clock on a Saturday night and the restaraunt was packed with other kids. Really? My sister asked if she had any not inflated balloons and the hostess handed her one and a stick. Wow!

I literally had to google it, at the Puyallup location they have the fry sauce list inside their menu why this Red Robin does not I have no idea!  Secondly when our food arrived I saw the manager bringing it out and then our server took it from him to serve us, this is when I noticed that the top fries on my plate were smashed like something was on top of them and then I found 2 mushrooms stuck to the other side of them. My burger had no mushrooms on them.  Thirdly about 5 minutes into getting our food she drops off the check for us. I really dislike receiving the check in the middle of us eating it felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant and it wasnt even a busy night!  Fourthly I had to hunt her down to get us more fries, its unlimited steak fries why am I waiting to get more of these? If you run past my table look to see that they are all gone and refill them.  Fifthly I let her know that we needed the check separated and I had a to go order for my husband she quickly seemed very inconvenienced by this, which is ridiculous because the higher my bill the higher your tip. Also in this economy I dont go out to eat very much so when I do I expect great customer service.  Lastly I am a red robin rewards member and I had a coupon for a free dessert she asked me to write the number down on the receipt and she would apply that for me. I wrote down the whole member number for her to come back and rudely tell me she can not do it by the member number it has to be the phone number. Ok.....so I gave her the number.

Chandra A.,"Olympia, WA",0,1,,2.0,6/27/2014,"Red robin has been my favorite place to get a awesome Cobb salad for the past 12 years. My daughter and I used to go almost weekly. They have had awesome servers, food, service and so on. That is until lately. The last time i tried to order to go, the service was horrible, rude, was getting my order wrong, and then hung up. I called back and the service was little better. I've only gone once since. This past Thursday, yesterday, I decided to order out again. My daughter works at the mall so I decided to order two Cobb salads. They were the WORST salads I've ever had. The avocado was Brown, tomatoes were pureed, the lettuce was Brown and 2 of the 4 ranches were chunky and tasted like spoiled mayo..

She is the reason for 2 stars instead of 1. While paying at the new kiosks on the table I had a question. The hostess was walking by so I asked her, she had no clue because she hadn't 'messed with them enough' and referred us to Sarah.

Daniel H.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",295,55,45,3.0,7/21/2011,"The Dirty Bird - and for good reason.  This place is like a 50's dinner and McDonalds had a baby and then that baby grew up and went to college and partied a lot.   Ambience:  Loud.  Bustling. A little cramped even though there is a billion tables.  Prepare to shout your conversation if you want to be heard.  Colorful. Fun? Staff:  This RR had a very young staff.  Lots of busy little servers, expos, hosts and bussers running around to make the place run well.  Red Robin staff is cheerful and helpful.  Though they will make a spectacle of you on your birthday. Food:  The food is standard american fare.  Burgers is the focus for your protein and fries (lots of them) for your starch.  Every sauce imaginable is ready at your request.  They have a lot of TALL food it seems... a onion ring tower and a mile high mud pie.  Good food all around.  I love the whiskey river BBQ burger and the Teriyaki Chicken Burger. Bottom line:  The food is pretty good.  Good place for kids because they can scream and no one will hear them over the din in that place.  They can color all over everything and the staff is pretty cool about it since they are all 15 years old.  There is a person in a costume that will scare them or make them happy. (It's a toss up for my kids)  Great for groups... we brought a party of 52 there one time with no reservation and they worked it out.  That was impressive.  If you have a big group most people in your party can agree to eat here since they have something for everyone.  The staff is always friendly about splitting checks and they have a built in 18% gratuity. It's not my cup of tea.. but I can see why people like it.  All you can eat fries with your burger is nice.  Though the food is pretty good I can't ignore the AMBIENCE.  RR put a lot of eggs in the ambience basket and I'm afraid it's either you love it or hate it... I happen to hate it.  Besides the guy in the bird costume scares my kids and flirts with my wife and then stays at my table for an hour... you can feel my pain.  Still,  I would recommend it for a fun night at dinner with the kids or some friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=80

Tonight after some Christmas shopping we stopped at red Robbin for some dinner. We waited about 20 mins to sit and once seated we quickly ordered some appetizers the pretzel bites and the poutine WITHOUT MUSHROOMS. We waited some time for them as the kitchen was backed up, upon arrival everything looked good my husband started in on the pretzels I looked over the poutine for mushrooms and didn't see any so I took a bite of the fry covered in gravy and cheese...after eating that steak fry I looked down and there under the top layer of fries lay a bunch of mushrooms. My husband jumped up to get the waitress and she took our fries. Less then 3 minutes later a ""new"" poutine came out, it was cold and from the way it came out looked like someone had just picked the mushrooms out, I asked the waitress if this had been made completely mushroom free because of my allergies I didn't feel comfortable eating it, she said she was sorry and she wouldn't feel comfortable eating it as well, and would have them make me a new poutine without mushrooms. The item charge was taken off our bill and the 3rd time it came out great.... I started feeling sick half way into the hour long wait it took for us to get our cold burgers, our 11 month old was over this experience as well thankfully he was being as great as he could be as we had now been there for almost 2 hrs. I realized on our ride home I was having an allergic reaction I started dry heaving and then started throwing up, I called the manager and his customer service came off rude as he repeated over and over ""what am I suppose to do about it.""

About 5 mins later she came and wiped it down and we ordered Drinks, as well as asked for a basket of fries since we were all going to order meals anyway.

And that they don't give the fries out like that anymore. We were still waiting for one person to join us so we didn't end up ordering our meals yet. We were shocked as that is a very normal thing to happen at red robin and it seemed a little weird we were told that when every other time in our lives we have gotten French fries before our food orders no problem.

Over the years I've been to Red Robin a fair amount - in multiple locations.  Overall, they're not too bad.  This location was always good until my most recent visit.  I and two friends went in around 8 pm on a recent Wednesday evening.  We sat in the bar because it wasn't very crowded.  We ordered, ate, had relatively decent service - really, no complaints.  However, I accidentally left my sunglasses on the table when I left.  Had they been cheap sunglasses I wouldn't have cared but these were Coach aviators which cost a material amount.  I called the next morning when I realized I didn't have them.  I'm not one to misplace my things and I searched my car and house from top to bottom - there really is no other explanation.  Also, I distinctly remember taking them off my head and placing them on my table.  I spoke with multiple people over the next few days to no avail.  On at least two occasions they said they would get back to me and did not so I kept calling.   I will say, the Assistant Manager (I think his name was Jerry) was very understanding and eager to help.  It's unfortunate I cannot say the same for the General Manager (GM) or anyother staff I spoke with.  I was told I would get a call from the GM the next time he was at the restuarant but they never called.  At that point, I had been calling for about a week trying to get some resolution but eventually gave up, convinced that an employee simply walked off with my sunglasses. This whole situation has been really disappointing.  Decent and quick service means nothing if the staff at this particular location have no integrity or respect for the customers they are supposed to serve.  The only way I will go back to this location is if I velco all my belongings to my body to prevent the sticky-fingered staff from making off with my stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=100

He brought us a new prime rib in 4 min(why did it take so long before, they were not that busy) when he brought it back it still had garlic fries, he said he would take it off the bill and get us one with out garlic fries, we kept it and ate so we could get out of there. Our waitress finally showed up (still no refills) and gave us our check, we paid cash, 2 dollars over the amount. She came back and we complained about the service and she got mad at us, grabbed the money and stormed off and disappeared, so she only got a 2 dollar tip. We will never goto this Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=100
Yoshi M.,"Lacey, WA",50,38,,3.0,3/4/2008,"Red Robin is a great place to get burgers. They are known for their burgers. I've been there many times. If you like the fanfare with all the waiters/waitresses singing happy birthday to you, Red Robin is definitely the place to go to. It's a lot of fun, and I think everyone really enjoys it. The atmosphere is very family oriented, and very friendly. The staff are very nice and helpful. The food is exceptional, and I would rate this particular store with 4 stars with an exception. On a couple occasions they have actually managed to run out of beef and french fries! Crazy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=100
Olympiagal P.,"Thurston, WA",0,23,,1.0,8/9/2009,"GROSS!!  we met some friends for dinner.  The service was slow and way too stepford wife cheerful.  The place was painfully noisy.  The food was just so mass produced.  It was semi-edible as far as chain restaurants go.  By that I mean like McDonalds is semi-edible, BUT NOT as good as McDonalds.  But, with that lukewarm endorsement, I must say that I felt sick after I ate.  Not the-I think I have ecoli sick, but sick with a heavy gut feeling and awful headache from all the hormones, chemicals and cups of sodium that each lab created ""signature"" dish contains.  It SUCKS!  For the love of god, just keep driving!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=100
Katie H.,"Olympia, WA",0,27,4,2.0,8/4/2011,"The food is always dependable, but the service is REALLY inconsistent.  Sometimes you have food 10 minutes after ordering, but as of now we have been waiting 30 minutes for a kids meal and a burger and can't find our server to ask about our order.  UPDATE: after 32 minutes we got lukewarm mac n' cheese and a cold burger with cold, burned sweet potato fries.  They ""remade"" it and I got an overcooked burger and the same burned sweet potato fries back.  To their credit, they did comp the burger.  2nd UPDATE:  Went back last week to give them another shot.  Burger was only slightly better than last time, the campfire sauce hadn't been mixed well so it was full of big white chunks of something (mayo?).  The fries were great this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=100
Julian H.,"Seattle, WA",151,819,9,3.0,12/19/2008,"Well this Red Robin is great, as Red Robins go but you pretty much have to park across the street at the mall and walk over. Which is fine unless it's raining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=100
Glen A.,"Olympia, WA",0,78,,5.0,1/22/2011,I've been going to the Red Robin for years. I have tried every burger on the menu. I'd eat here more often but my cardiologist might kill me before the burgers ard fries will.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=100
