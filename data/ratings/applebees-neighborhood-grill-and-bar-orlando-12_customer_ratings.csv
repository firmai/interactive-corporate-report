When we walked into a mostly empty restaurant (at the height of the missing lunch rush), the bartender, hostess and one of three wait staff were crowded into the far corner of the bar chatting. They looked up, went back to their conversation, then the hostess reluctantly, brusquely and without eye-contact led us to our table. The waitress seemed to get lost after each visit to our table.

Fourth, the food was terrible. The steak quesadilla had one piece of steak for each tortilla and the soup looked like water with pieces of vegetables. Lastly, when my soup came in, it was still COLD! Oh and the waiter seemed like he wanted to go home, extremely unenthusiastic and serious. I love Applebee's, but this one was the worst I've ever been to. He seemed clueless about what's on the menu.

Finally, when we were tired of eating the lime from our water, the food arrived! The appetizers and the entrées got there at the same time. I got the chicken and it was pretty good.  My gf on the other hand did not have anything near a ""pretty good"" meal. Her soup was cold. Her Steak quesedilla literally had one peice of meat and her burger egg rolls were the only thing that came out warm.  The waiter was too serious and seemed like he wanted to go home already. He was also extremely forgetful and not tentative to detail. If I were a waiter and I had to warm up someone's food because it was cold, then I'd make sure to be on top of it and make the rest of the experience the best, but he did not.

He then said he just walked in and would come right back. 5 more minutes went by. Two managers walked by and asked if we were being served.

Their meal which is gauranteed in 15 minutes or under came at minute 19. My meal was originally the Apple cranberry chicken dish for 11.99. It came out tasteless and the chicken was severely overcooked. I sent it back and asked to change to the 8.49 Caesar chicken salad. She said sure. The salad came. No crutons and barely any cheese. The chicken was again extremely overcooked. I was not.offered a drink which comes with that offer. I had a water already so i guess she thought that was all i wanted. We asked to see the manager but she stated he was in the kitchen cooking. I would have gotten a better salad if i went and bought a fresh express prepackaged bag and added canned chicken.

The ""greeter"", wearing a baseball cap and smelling strongly of alcohol fumbled with the menus and led us to a table.  After about 5 mins Sarah arrives.  IMHO she was as high as a kite - rambling loudly on, telling us her life story....except the part where she could not remember whether Los Angeles was in California or not. She takes our drink orders and disappears for 5 mins, stopping by to say the drinks will be ready in a minute.  This seems odd as there were only two other couples besides us there.  Eventually, she brings our drinks but tells me that mine was not mixed correctly, but she thought I would like it better this way.  What????  I told her to take it back and have it mixed correctly, which she did. The food arrives (15-20 mins after ordering) and it is typical Applebee's - not flashy, but it tastes good.  Our only issue was with the servers. Management needs to get a ""secret shopper"" in there ASAP and see what is going on.  There is a reason for all the poor reviews and why Chili's down the street is full of people and they are practically empty.
