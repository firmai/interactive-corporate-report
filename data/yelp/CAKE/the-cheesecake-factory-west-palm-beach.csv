Alycia K.,"Tannersville, PA",85,10,,1.0,9/22/2017,The food was terrible. Management was clueless. Waste of a night out with family from out of town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=40
Nick M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",57,2,,1.0,6/3/2017,"Unfortunately Yelp doesn't give the option to give zero stars.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had the misfortune of having.  It was my father in-laws birthday so we got a table for 6.  The dining experience started out great. We were told there was a 20-30 minute wait. Five minutes later we were sitting down. Our server was very friendly, but seemed overwhelmed.  He did his best to keep us happy.  I wouldn't suggest wasting your money on cocktails.  There are plenty of places in CityWalk to get a good drink.  Their manager Eric is very unprofessional.  If you have any issues arise during your dining experience - be sure to ask for Alicia. She was very courteous, understanding, and professional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=40

Melissa M.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,17,10,2.0,5/13/2017,"This is ridiculous, 20 minutes waiting for a piece of carrot cake. This restaurant needs some good engineering to improve their processes. There is a bottleneck of people at the entrance: some waiting to be seated, others coming out, others doing line to order from the bakery, others waiting for their order, waitresses coming to get their customers orders ... a chaos. The employees are doing too many things at the same time instead of having a production line. In addition, instead of preparing the desserts for the customers eating at the restaurant in a separate area, they do it in the same place and that delays the process even more. This restaurant has good food and variety but needs to work on that in all of their restaurants. Honestly, I done feel I am going to come back any time soon. It's always the same mess. Very uncomfortable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=40

Susan B.,"Wellington, FL",19,113,,4.0,7/20/2016,"This place serves very good food and we are never disappointed at the serving size, taste or quality of the food served.  We took our three well behaved teenaged granddaughters there Monday about 3:00pm since we wanted no wait and hoped to have a quieter experience than we usually do when we dine there primetime.  Our server was very nice and knowledgeable but we had to flag staff for drink refills.  We ordered a lot of food and were handed the menus for dessert without the table being cleared.  We finally got another server to do that for us.  There were 4 servers there by 4pm and most were standing around talking to each other.  That is unusual for the CF since their service always matches their food - consistently excellent.  Perhaps management needs to be more visible at slower times.  Our server was lovely and helpful, just absent and unavailable too much of the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=40
Jon N.,"Jupiter, FL",31,64,2,4.0,11/12/2016,"We have been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years.   The menu is great, they cover every taste.   Hard not to find something for your pallet.      They must tell the servers to go lightly on the bread.   Getting a 2nd order isn't as easy as one would think.    If you decide to eat out on the patio be very careful of the umbrella stands.   They are painted the same color as the floor and you would think the maitre d would warn you.   Not the case, I tripped over one and thank God I kept my balance or I would have ended up on a table with people eating.   At the end of the meal we ordered a piece of cheesecake to go.   My wife ordered lemon raspberry.  When we got home which was within the hour we opened the container.  I should of taken a picture of it.   First off, it was a small piece.   Not worthy of the $7.95 price.    To make it even worse, the bottom was soggy.   That tells me it's not one of their more popular flavors.   What's going on? Are the slices bigger if eaten there, smaller when taken home?   If I saw the waiter delivering that piece to a table I'd say no way am I ordering cake that is how small it was.

Hardev M.,"Boca Raton, FL",199,25,5,4.0,6/11/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory never disappointments. Arrives and only had to wait 15 minutes on a Saturday evening. The location is downtown West Palm with numerous restaurants and lively atmosphere in the area. The menu is extensive and you will find a dish no matter what you are in the mood for - pasta, salad, fish, burgers etc. I ordered the Mac n Cheese topped veggie burger which was absolutely delicious and even came with a side of fries. Both meals were brought out at the same time and very hot. For dessert we ordered a Hershey's cake which was very rich in chocolate and filling.

Burj S.,"Boca Raton, FL",238,316,1421,4.0,1/5/2015,"OK OK OK I will have to change my view of TCF after this trip to the West Palm Beach one, oh so different from the one in Boca.  We were very pleasantly greeted at the door and even though it was busy our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The food was good and we had a party of 5 and we all enjoyed our meals which were tasty and the helpings were very generous.  The desserts were amazing as usual. Now the one point I would like to make is what is more important than anything is GOOD SERVICE and for the life of me I cannot understand why such a difference between the Boca one and the WPB one!  As a matter of fact I have stopped going to the Boca one and lucky for us the Grand Luxe Cafe is in the same area (thier upscale Restaurant) so we always go there!

Adriana R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",103,49,291,4.0,4/28/2016,"While I have eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location numerous times, this review details my visit on Wednesday, April 27. I came here to eat a late lunch around 3:15 PM. Since the dinner rush had not hit yet, the building was largely empty - making for a quiet, peaceful environment. Rather than stick to what I know, as I usually do, I tried something different from the menu: a macaroni and cheese burger. I never understood why so many people make such a big deal about cheese - after this burger, I now understand. The fried macaroni and cheese ball on top of the patty was delicious, and so was the cheese sauce. I asked for sautéed white onion on the side, which paired well with the burger. The bun was toasted, and of course the portion size was large. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium well, but to me to tasted (and looked) well-done. Next time I'll ask for medium so that I get a juicer burger. In my experience, the great food at The Cheesecake Factory is always mirrored by great service. This time, however, the service wasn't so great. Our waiter almost seemed timid. He was very soft-spoken. He did not have a warm personality, however he was not cold either - he was more passive than anything. He didn't smile once. I was actually surprised that he was a waiter there, because I know The Cheesecake Factory can be pretty picky when it comes to their wait staff. Another small side note about our waiter: he was wearing very chunky jewelry: a large ring and a heavy silver men's bracelet. I never understood why companies always made a point to disallow employees from wearing jewelry on the job. After seeing our waiter approach the table and being immediately distracted by his jewelry, I now understand that rule. Seeing him in that kind of jewelry actually made him remind me of a Nigerian prince or something. Anyhow, I digress. While the service was not outstanding as it usually is when I visit The Cheesecake Factory, the new burger I tried was delicious - another item I can cross off of their very expansive menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=20

Billy N.,"CityPlace, West Palm Beach, FL",51,4,4,2.0,6/17/2017,Had dinner at this location last night and ordered the Ribeye steak.  If you ever come here DO NOT order the ribeye.  It tasted like this thing was soaking in the Dead Sea for 40 days and night.  It was so salty.  My wife ordered the mac and cheeseburger and it was good.  This is actually the second Cheesecake Factory that served their steak like this.  So I'm starting to think it's like this everywhere.  Avoid the steak.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=20

Chris W.,"Boynton Beach, FL",90,66,62,4.0,3/25/2017,"Located right in the heart of CityPlace in West Palm Beach, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the best restaurants around. I don't know how the head chef does it.  Their menu here is HUGE.  There are selections from burgers and steak to chicken and salads - even a skinnylicious part of the menu for those who watch calories.  Of course, who can pass up their massive selection of cheesecake all made on site?  There has to be 30-40 different kinds of cheesecake.  I haven't tried them all, but what I have tried was excellent! I usually end up getting the steak tacos or the cajun chicken littles.  I'll say it again - there are so many choices that its hard just to pick one!  They literally hand you a book for a menu. As you could imagine, being in the heart of CityPlace, expect to wait for a seat during normal lunch and dinner hours.  This place doesn't take reservations so it's on a first come first serve basis. It's great for take-out if you're on the run and the portions are large enough for two meals.  It's a little on the high side as far as pricing, but the food is worth it.  I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=20
AL D.,"Old Bethpage, NY",0,7,,1.0,11/25/2017,"Wow. Can't believe all the negative reviews concerning the service are true. 2 adults and our dog so we had to sit on the sidewalk. I understand. 10 minutes until server arrives. We order a soda, a water and our lunch. I have a whole conversation with server about my dish. The dish is offered on two different menus with a price difference.  Server explains the difference. Another 20 minutes they bring me the wrong dish. Not even close to what I ordered. I tell the food runner. Servers appears and tells me another 10 minutes. Tell her forget it and please send a manager. Manager explains that the server is just covering the sidewalk tables.  After conversations with a totally clueless manager I then realized why the service is so bad. She was totally clueless and comped wife's lunch and offered us a piece of cheesecake. That's real funny considering I never ate lunch. Instead of arguing with this clueless manager we got up and left.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=20
Big T.,"Pleasanton, CA",63,128,,2.0,11/12/2017,"I always like the food at this place. Last night was a little odd. Went in about midnight - still very busy. But I still had to wait awhile for bar service for a considerable time. Even after I got the menu, still had to wait. They just seemed unorganized because I was asked by three different people, but no progress was made. Then I ordered eggs and potatoes, over-easy. A little later, the manager is proactive and tells me that the eggs were not done to the waitresses liking. At this time, it was about 1245am. I said, whatever condition they are, I will take them and be happy to pay for them. They had me - I was starving, coming in from the west coast. They were right - what the hell happened to these poor eggs? And the potatoes were at a crisp. Reminded me that, late at night, you have no idea of the condition of the person cooking your food.

Briahna M.,"San Francisco, CA",95,4,,1.0,8/8/2017,This was the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Even the one that's always packed in San Francisco has better service than this one.

Then it took around 35 mins to bring us our food that wasn't worth the prices. During our meal we asked for them to bring us all waters that they had forgotten & it took around 10 mins to bring that to us. Mind you they were not busy AT ALL.

Katie C.,"Cambridge, MA",85,82,33,2.0,12/29/2017,"Someone else used the term ""chaos"" and I think that is the perfect term for the hostess stand. They were having all sorts of problems- couldn't work the computers, menus strewn all over the place, a line out the door, etc. We were a large party but had reservations. Yet we waited for 30 minutes and watched several other parties get seated before being seated ourselves, and only because I went back up to ask about the status. Apparently our table had been ready for a while and they had just forgotten about us.  Having worked as a hostess in the past, I understand how stressful of a job it can be. You have to coordinate the entire restaurant's seating arrangements while also balancing angry customers, servers, and management. But the least you can do is have a welcoming attitude. You're the first person a customer encounters. This hostess didn't smile once and she barely communicated with me. Her demeanor made me feel like I was a huge inconvenience, and that's the last thing a customer should feel when first arriving to a restaurant.  It's a shame the hostess stand was such a mess because it sets a horrible tone for the rest of the visit. Luckily, our actual dinner went smoothly. The quality of food was typical for the chain and the service was quick and friendly. But it would have been nice if someone had at least apologized for the wait. (I've been given free dessert for far less at our local Cambridge location without even complaining, and those types of unprompted gestures go a long way.) Management just doesn't seem to be on top of it here and I hope they can work out the kinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach
John S.,"Williamstown, KY",79,33,3,3.0,10/8/2017,"Amazing food lousy service. We were so excited to be near a Cheesecake factory!  Tonight my fiance and I both tried something new and we left stuffed. The parmesan crusted chicken was the BEST thing  I've ever eaten, the green beans were excellent as well.  The cheesecake has always been good, and tonight was no different. You can go wrong with the food in Cheesecake factory. You CAN go wrong when it comes to the service. We we're seated quickly (abnormal for my experiences as they are usually out the door) we were excited and hungry. Our server didn't arrive for 5 minutes. Trying to be understanding we proceeded to examine the menu top to bottom, even selecting our dessert options ahead of time. Our server finally showed up and apologized for the wait. We explained it wasn't a real problem and ordered our drinks and entrees. We waited for the food to be brought, but found it concerning when our drinks were empty and she passed our table at least 4 times without checking in. Our entrees came and, as we said, they were incredible. We were in good spirits and enjoying the incredible food. Our drinks were eventually refilled and our server disappeared again. She finally arrived for dessert ordering. I asked for a refill of my drink. Our desserts took longer than we expected to arrive and my server never brought my glass back. She came back to drop of the check, she then disappeared when we asked for to go boxes and another server had to bring the boxes to us.

To begin with the service was extremely slow. Usually you  get a basket of bread right away but we waited 15-20 min before the bread cake and the server showed up to take our order. It took so long for our meal to come out that it was cold once it arrived (cold fish is not very appetizing). The interesting thing was that waitstaff would gather in groups around the bar while customers were trying to flag someone down. It was chaos. I won't be visiting this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach
Caitlyn C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",95,3,,1.0,12/30/2017,"This was honestly one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. From the food quality to the service, everything was very poor. It took AT LEAST 20 minutes to receive our drinks and a basket of bread. (We had to keep reminding the waitress every time she walked by.)  We finally get our food after an hour and my food is cold. I was so hungry I ate it anyway for fear of waiting longer to reorder another dish. My friend's food order was completely wrong on the first try. The second try he found plastic in it! The manager came over to the table to apologize and then asked US what we'd like to do about it? There should be no asking what we would like. There was plastic in the food so comp the meal! It was like a poorly run circus in there. Moe's down the street would give you better service than this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach
Marc W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",20,125,21,4.0,11/25/2017,Show night at Kravis Center and decided to have dinner at Cheesecake Factory.  As usual it was very busy so we ate at the bar.  Never a great idea as people want to get drinks and push in while you eat.  The bartenders were very nice but they were extremely busy so service was slow.  The food is always solid but nothing exceptional.  Had the bang bang chicken and shrimp which was supposed to be Thai curry. It tasted much more like an Indian curry which I don't really like.  It was ok but nothing I loved.  My wife had a antioxidant salad which she liked but they were very stingy on the shrimp she added.  Overall an ok experience tonight.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach

A lot to pay for 3 spring rolls (basically veggies); crab dip was greasy and over cooked. I had the eggplant parmesan (which the waiter recommended highly) which could have doubled as door stoppers - 3 square squares on a plate (1 was burnt) that measured about 4x4x2"" and had about 2TB of marinara sauce and some rubbery cheese. The pasta had been pre-cooked and was very al dente. Hubby got the Cajun jambalya pasta - same deal. Pasta was a lump of ??? and had drizzled sauce. We ate it - should have sent it back.

We were shopping around City Place and decided to have lunch at cheesecake factory because they had an outdoor patio. We have seen dogs on their patio many times and asked if it was OK to have our dogs also. They said yes and they tried to put us the sidewalk where it was raining and the tables were soaking wet. A manager came out and told us that we could not sit on the inside of the fence because we had dogs. Seemed as if she was discriminating against us because she didn't like dogs. She asked us to tie our dogs to the fence so we could sit on the inside of the fence. Our dogs would have been sitting in the rain had tied them on the fence. We felt completely unwelcome and as if we should never return. Very disappointed with this restaurant, we won't be returning.  Luckily, we went down to the way and ate at mellow Mushroom where they welcomed us with dog treats and water bowls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach
MJ H.,"Delray Beach, FL",49,45,308,2.0,3/12/2017,"Stopped in for brunch today. We typically go to the Boca location and love it! Things headed south fairly quickly with a dirty bread plate and a water mug that had a sticker on the side (see photo). It said warning may cause cancer - not what I want to see on the container my sons water is in! The manger came over to discuss why our food hadn't come up yet and we pointed out the mug. He seemed more concerned about a not clean mug then the cancer component, but brought us water in glasses.  Had the fried cheese small plate - very tasty perfect for 2 people. Had the monte cristo for brunch - also pretty good (had no seasoning for some reason). My son had the kids pancakes.  When it was time to pay we out our debit card in the holder with the bill on the table (card sticking up). She took ours with 4-5 other folders. While we ate our cheesecake the waitress came back and said she had lost our debit card. We asked her to retrace her steps. Eventually she came back and said she couldn't find it, but made it sound like she had run it and lost it in the way back. We asked to to make sure she didn't give it to another table. Then she and the manager came back and said she hadn't run it and they would keep looking for it. The manager took our number and said he'd call if it turned up. He comped our brunch and gave us his card.  Unfortunately we then had to spend 20 min on the phone with PNC canceling our card. So our brunch was not as tasty as other cheesecakes AND took up an hour of time waiting to see if they could find our card and then canceling the card.  The take away: I'll never drink out of a plastic mug at any cheesecake again and I'll stick with Boca.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach

We had strawberry martinis (delish), fried zucchini (always great), Mac and cheese balls and Cuban rolls to start. All of it was really good, but they changed the sauce on the Cuban rolls so that sucked. The previous mustard sauce was much better. I had the herb crusted salmon for my entree and it was cooked perfectly. The mash potatoes are always so good and the buerre blanc sauce is to die for. Definitely recommend!

By the time we left they were jammed! Nice lunch specials- lunch portions of salads, pastas, sandwich combos and more. I had the barbecue chicken salad- nice mix of lettuce, black beans, corn, tomatoes and diced chicken breast. Yum! We all enjoyed our lunches but one person thought her glass of sangria was a little high at $7.00.  Service was good but the reason I am giving 4 stars rather than 5 is that our meals came out spaced too far apart. The first meals were separated from the last ones by almost 5 minutes.

We waited about 10 minutes for a table for 4 when the restaurant was very slow Not a big deal. Got to our booth and there were crumbs on both sides of the table, we wiped away without a word from the hostess. Server can't by promptly and asked about drinks, etc. Our server was attentive, nice and brought everything just as she said she would. Ordered firecracker salmon appetizer that was drenched in oil... Was OK, I guess. We were starving! All our orders were wonderful, tasted great and came out very, very hot. Was wonderful.  Service other than our server eat my issue, I guess. When a young man was cleaning the table next to ours another one came by and they exchanged in a loud conversation, laughing about something. It drowned out our conversation. Then going to the restroom and when leaving, other servers /wait staff would nearly run over you in the aisle. I understand if busy, but the place was not busy and.... Never once a ""sorry, excuse me"". Don't understand that.  But as you can see from the rating, loved the place and will be back. It's just...

Finish my next two bread and now looking at two more breads and wondering if it's really worth asking for butter again. Nah, I'll just politely wait for me food, eat it and then get my cheesecake to go and to not return. I'm just glad I can grab cheesecake here without having to eat here in the future.

Ana L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",99,69,850,4.0,5/18/2017,"For a chain restaurant this is probably my favorite. Not my first choice of places to go but definitely a safe choice as every time I eat at any Cheesecake Factory, they're pretty consistent in quality. This particular location is one of my favorites as it is located right in the beautiful and scenic city place. Also there are outside seating in two sides of the restaurant. First plus their house baked warm bread served with side of butter. Nothing like fresh warm bread to make any tummy smile:) My favorite dish is the chicken Madeira (named after a sauce made from a liquor from the Madeira Islands that belong to Portugal. They're drinks are always well made and delicious. My Pre dinner go-to drink favorite is the passionfruit mojito. And of course their cheesecake selections are always on point. Being a chocoholic I usually get the tuxedo cheesecake (yummm!)...

Jade C.,"Delray Beach, FL",183,264,684,3.0,10/13/2013,"I am always amazed by the bizarre and extensive menu at The Cheesecake Factory. Regardless, we ended up at this location at about 11:30pm Saturday night and it was a pleasant surprise that the full menu was available until 12:30am.  The server was a bit of a let down. Not personable, we only saw him to take the order, after the food came via someone else and for the bill at the end, which was a shame because I was wanting to order a glass of wine which never happened.  I ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken. Firstly in my opinion it wasn't spicy, it had a zesty kick but only because of major overkill of onions and garlic. I think it should have been renamed ""Onion Chicken"", because the cashew was certainly not the star of the show, more like a element for crunchy texture. There was several times I bit into a full garlic clove which wasn't very pleasant. But overall the chicken made the dish edible and almost enjoyable.  We skipped the cheesecake because it was late, in retrospect that probably would have been the highlight of the night.

Brian R.,"Boca Raton, FL",900,1223,4090,3.0,1/27/2016,"Of the big chain eateries, Cheesecake Factories are distinguished by high quality food and chefs who are good culinary artists just shy of a standalone fine dining restaurant. They're big and raucous places, with menus that are broad so that there is something for everyone. I eat off their ""skinny"" menu where the calories are under 590. The problem is that really, most of their food should be no more than 800 calories. Much of what they serve is like a day-plus worth of food. In effect, they're like the upscale Burger King. You go to a place with the name ""Cheesecake"" in it, you expect a certain level of decadence, I suppose, but half the time the oversized menu even works against dessert lovers because you're too full to actually enjoy dessert, unless you came there just for that.  The skinny menu was a response to their gluttonous bill of fare, but the better response might be to join the movement of restaurants that are delivering high taste and even fairly rich foods, but in portions that are kinder to their patrons' waistlines and hearts.  They lose another star for their tip calculator, which suggests tips on the total, not the sub-total. Sales tax is neither a good nor a service, and the only thing it does is give a raise to the servers from the math-challenged. It is incredibly tacky, particularly for a big chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=100

Bartenders not being able to make a popular drink for my mom due to not having a recipe...and in the day of Google?!

One thing about these people that review these places is they have no idea how hard it is to run a place like this.  Cheesecake factory executes wonderfully.  Most people on here have no clue and being as I am in the industry myself I can say what a great job this place does.

Brett S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,142,,4.0,1/28/2012,"We have been going to Cheese Cake for years. The food is usually good  With decent size portions. My favorite is either any of the salads or chicken dish's washed down with their passion fruit ice tea. The service is usually very good unless it gets over crowded. This men's going early and skipping Friday nights. This year they added a ""Skinnydelicious"" menu. This compromises of low calorie choices. I also like the dark pumpernickel bread which is served hot. The ambiance is exceptional and thy spend lot's of money in providing a visual presentation.

Poor service etiquette. Then explains that this has been a policy for six months . The highest suggested dollar amount for gratuity $2.53 the amount we were going to leave $5 because she did give good service for simple dessert & coffee. What she failed mention our state stopped adding 18% gratuity to parties 6 or more. So management told them it was fine to circle receipts for parties 6 or more. Since it was just my husband. & I she should not have done this. So since I am incapable of tipping a based on great service, I guess $2.53 is what she earned. FYI restaurant servers have been doing this to African American & Latin customers for a years assuming that we don't know how to tip.... It's insulting . I have worked in the food industry, and have been going to restaurants since I was a kid and have always known how to tip for good service even prior to receipt telling me how much to tip. So please make sure your social etiquette is on point it makes the difference in a great night & a poor night . Thank you to the manager for speaking w/us. It didn't restore our happiness, but at least he took consideration that the system is flawed. Now they just need to teach their servers how to own their mistakes.

The service? Well, the low-lights were forgetting our drink orders, bringing out two entrees, and forgetting the third still had to be delivered, and her inability to retrieve a bottle of ketchup. The food? My wife's Burrito Grande was inedible, seasoned with something ""unusual"". My daughters pasta was way undercooked, I guess raw would be appropriate.

It was so good that on our last night at palm beach we decided to get takeout from here and kick back at the hotel with the wonderful food. The Shrimp Scampi pasta was PERFECT, except for the vast amount of butter coating it.  The sauce was just the right amount of lemony sour, the whole garlic cloves sweet, the diced tomatoes bright.  The shrimp didn't taste fresh, but were huge and deep fried. The Jamaican black pepper shrimp was packed full of spices, but nothing special.

Lady X.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,28,28,2.0,10/8/2016,"So Cheesecake Factory has long been a go-to favorite of mine for about 10-15 years (particularly Fort Lauderdale/Las Olas). It has stayed with me in recent years because Of the  refreshingly new menu items that are occasionally rolled in. Further, it was where I had my first date while dating my husband (Fort Lauderdale Las Olas), and where I got engaged (romantic re-creation of our first date). The manager played such a large roll in making the engagement successful, and even did a nice cheesecake plating for our engagement photos later on. On occasion when we're in the mood for cheesecake, we'd run out to CF for a slice to share. So clearly, it is near to my heart.  We came to this location for the first time a few weeks ago to celebrate my sister's birthday. I was surprised by all the new items on the menu (hadn't eaten there in a while) so it took us longer than usual to make a selection. I was taken aback by the fact that our waitress kept rushing us and was visibly annoyed by our indecisiveness. She wasn't even informed enough on the offerings to help us reach a quick decision. Anyway, my sister ordered the new Southern dish which was amazing. I had the chicken Marsala which was very flat. The chicken as clearly boiled and had no flavor, and the marsala sauce was bland. I love having this dish at weddings and know that it has the potential to be really yummy. Anyway, before my food arrived I asked the waitress for some asparagus and it came over 15 minutes later when I was done eating. When we got the bill, I was charged $7 for the asparagus which was grill burned and I wasn't able to eat it (I thought it was free like some other places!) Rather than waiting for the waitress to return I stopped an employee who I later discovered was the manager and asked him to find my waitress and ask her to remove the asparagus. He introduced himself as the manager (short hispanic guy, cant remember the name) and said that this was the only portion of asparagus they serve and he can provide me with another one but he will not remove it from the bill. I was Shocked!! A manager? Asparagus?! So when the waitress returned she came with the new asparagus! I told her I had no use for the asparagus because it originally arrived at the end of my meal and was charred. She knew it was the truth and said she would go back and ask the manager if she could remove it. It took her 20 minutes to get this approval. She then took back the asparagus, which Im guessing may make an appearance on someone else's plate the following day after sitting on the table being talked over and possibly spitted on. I was just very shocked by this highly classified process over asparagus which I could buy a bag of at Publix for half the price!!!! If she mentioned that the asparagus was an entire side costing $7 and not a 'small portion' as I requested, we wouldn't have had the issue to begin with.  Overall: CF is CF. Always loved it and that wont change solely from this experience.  They have little control over the food because its chain, so if its bad here, its likely bad everywhere. I, however, will never return to this lousy location managed by a lousy manager. I'll hold our cheesecake cravings until we get to Fort Lauderdale, or head to Boca where Junior's Cheesecake has finally opened at Mizner Park.

Pastas, hamburguers, seafood, asian-thai food, caribbean, light menu....anything.  And in every visit whith friends and family, never does a dish dissappoint.

We all stopped eating as we lost our appetite - waited for a manager to come over. That took a long time. The manager denied our request to comp our meals. Just the one meal where the hair was found.

Sarah K.,"Lake Worth, FL",170,18,8,1.0,3/15/2017,"Our experience last night was so bad it ended up being comical. I've been to this location a few times before and it's never been great but this time it was really bad. I went with my husband and young son. We were seated quickly and everything started out fairly normal. We got out drinks and then placed our order with the waiter. When we placed the order, we asked what kind of fruit came in the fruit cup and the waiter replied ""apples, strawberries and blueberries."" I remember this specifically because those were my son's favorite fruits so it was perfect. About 10 minutes later our server came back and told us they were out of one of our two appetizers so we picked a different one. As we were waiting, we realized we hadn't received bread so as our waiter was heading to another table to drop some off, we asked to have some and he said, ""oh, this was meant for you...."" 20 minutes later - still no appetizers or food on the table, our waiter comes back and says they are out of our entree, so we picked another. It took a total of 45 minutes for us to get our appetizers and my son's food (we had requested to come with the appetizers.) We started eating and it was very apparent the food had been sitting in the kitchen for a while based on how hot the plate was and the film that had formed over the dipping sauces. We started focusing on feeding our son and noticed the fruit had nothing the waiter had mentioned, it had pineapples, a single grape and BLACK BEANS!!!!! There were black beans mixed into his fruit cup!!!! We called over a manager and explained what we'd experienced and showed him the beans and he said, ""the beans are right next to the fruit in the kitchen so that's probably what happened..""  We told the waiter to cancel our entrees because we'd been there so long and had already had such a bad experience- he cancelled the entrees and brought us our check. We paid full price for everything and they offered no solution to our time well wasted. We will never be going back to this location - needless to say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=60

We were not sure why as there were plenty of open tables.  THAT should have been our first warning that this was not going to be a good experience! We were seated 10 mins later. The server came over to ask if we would like beverages. And we placed our order. 1 salad with chicken, 1 omelet and 1 chicken salad sandwich.  Nothing difficult or long cooking times.  We waited 20 mins for our meals. (Strike 2) THEN IT ALL WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE.  The salad was missing the chicken.  We looked around for the server.  No sign of her. She finally made a pass by. We flagged her down and showed her the salad with the missing chicken. She said oh! Ok. Then went to take an order from another table. She came back 5 mins later with a bowl of cut up chicken.  She tossed the bowl on the table and walked away.  We asked the hostess for the manager.  That was another 5 minute wait.  Swatting at flies on our food kept us occupied until Kate arrived.  We explained about the long wait time and the missing chicken.  She offered my friends Mom a piece of cheesecake for her trouble. And asked what did we want from her? We asked to have the salad removed from the bill. Fine. Now we are ready to get the heck out of there.

Our fried calamari arrived at the table and mind you it is before our bread basket.  Today's fried calamari was very disappointing, honestly the portion was a joke today (5 pieces of tentacles & 5 calamari ring pieces) now I did not bring this issue to the manager because I'm sure they have someone in the back who expedite the food before going out to the tables.  After half way eating our calamari finally our bread arrives, and it was cold and extremely hard. I brought the problem with the bread to our server and even showed her by hitting the hard bread on the table and it did not break at all.  I can't believe they served this to the customer, especially one with a 13 months old.  I order the ahí tartar and it was okay, the 4 pieces of fried wonton skin was disgusting. It was stale and old, which is probably from the day before that was refrigerated.  Ate one bite of the wonton and that was it.  Everything else was okay, not wonderful, just okay. One of our birthday girl ordered linguini Alfredo w/chicken ($3.50 extra) and only got 5 nugget size chicken on her pasta and it was crispy on one side, when she ate it it was chewy and hard. She did not finish her food. Now at the end we ordered 2 cheesecake and as we mention to the hostess before we sat that it was our twins girls birthday today, when the cheesecakes arrived there was no singing nor any special thing for our daughters. When I asked the server about it, she said no one mentioned anything about the girls birthday.  I'm disappointed, they came after the fact and from it being a surprise ended up being an embarrassing to the girls.  Very disappointed with our visit today, especially when we are there to celebrate our twin girls birthday. Food was disgusting, portion sucked, and the birthday song no where to be found.  As a regular customers I'm disappointed on how today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=80

Aliette the server was so incompetent ringing up our orders in a timely manner she even forgot about our soups and has the nerve to bring the soups as we are eating our entree and ask ""if we want them after our meal?""! On top of her bad service we were sat next to an open and close gate that employees use to head to the patio; here I realized the employees have no consideration for their patrons that are sat there (in this case mom and I) they slammed the gate door at least a good 50 times. And on top of that I asked for honey mustard with my sweet potato fries, I finished my burger first before Aliette even decided to check back on us. By this time my fries were cold and I had no honey mustard so I didn't even want them anymore. I finally asked to speak to her supervisor since her costumer service and the lack of respect the other employees had for us by slamming that gateway door had me over the roof. Kate (the manager) walks up to us and does not accommodate nor even offer anything for us to make us feel better about this horrible experience. To top it off Aliette charges us for our uneaten soups which she has control of when it comes to the time they arrive at our table since she's the one who has to prep and run them for her own tables but brought them after our entrees.

It was almost if this wasnt the first time. It really made me never want to eat out again let alone there. I will be writing a letter to the corporate & to the manager that oversees this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=120
J-Whit W.,"Park Ridge, IL",0,25,2,2.0,3/31/2015,A really expansive menu. Be sure to ask for recommendations to get be best/freshest food. We visited during spring break late in evening. Not crowded but OMG is service slow.  Friendly but soo slow. Food was quite good and reasonable in the end.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=120
Zandra R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",39,65,45,4.0,11/24/2013,"I met my friends here for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty full but they still had no wait. That was quite a surprise. The waiter was very prompt and polite.  He refilled our drinks a lot. Our food was really yummy, as expected.  Overall a great experience.  If you've never dined at a Cheesecake Factory, they have a very extensive menu from salads, to sandwiches, to Asian and Mexican. Everything is really rich and the portions are huge. The prices are on the high side but the food is generally yummy. They have a skinny menu but the meals are in the 500 calorie range. This is not a place to watch your calories.  Then there is the cheesecake.  My favorites are the dulce de leche and red velvet. The cheesecake is big enough to share.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=120
Patrick L.,"San Diego, CA",209,466,198,2.0,12/30/2010,"I can quickly summarize this place: - Food is ok - nothing great, most everything good/acceptable - Cheesecake is above average with lots of creative variations (red velvet cheesecake?) - Significantly overpriced, especially for beverages, soups, and appetizers - Advertising on menus (really, like for local dating websites - very chintzy - at these prices you think they can afford to print menus without ad support) - We had two servers, both couldn't care less about our experience or our food, trained to ask how's the meal and have a nice day but don't really care about your answer Food is about 3 stars but all in all the experience is 2 stars.  For the price, I'd rather have three meals elsewhere. Come here if you want dessert - share a piece of cake with your lovie .  Have dinner somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=120
Seth L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,87,38,2.0,1/20/2015,"Typical Cheesecake Factory experience, however this location is not nearly as polished as others. Cuban Sandwich EXCELLENT. Ice Coffee is really bad (they poor hot coffee over ice). Fruit Cup served with some of the brunch dishes were old and not fresh, I can't believe they even served it. Could the fruit have been sitting under a heat lamp since it was hot? Service was really really slow with not a manager in sight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=120

Autumn S.,"Decatur, GA",106,235,5,3.0,5/20/2013,"Huge almost overwhelming menu and very loud. They do have enough options though to suit the taste of even the most picky family members which is a big plus for me.  Can't say this would be my first, second, or even third choice of restaurant however I have always eaten my dishes received. It's not memorable dishes but I do remember I enjoy each time.  The drinks are a bit mix flavored but again when out with a big family this place works. I'm sure if someone loved cheesecake they would be able to up the star count but I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I'm sure that makes me a little biased.  Also with the location of this place it can at times take way to long to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=120

Adam R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",4,38,,3.0,2/13/2015,"I've read the story of how the cheesecake factory came to be, great story, but seems like this cheesecake factory is not like the others. The staff is slow, slower than I've ever been to at any of the other cheesecake factory establishments, and they are not friendly. I ordered two appetizers and a slice of cheesecake for a small lunch with my girl, and they say 20 minutes. I went there, and they said, yes.. 20 minutes, after it had been 20 minutes. The staff was lallygagging and when I said to check on the entrees, they didn't check. Than, once I saw the bill for two appetizers and one slice of cheesecake, I realized, this cheesecake factory decided, based on the area, to charge 1.4 times the average cost- I smell corruption is all I have to say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=120
Cindy G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",2,85,17,3.0,12/18/2014,"Love the location and the ambiance but a little disappointed in the food.  Had the Sweet Corn Tamales in Orlando and they were thick, hearty and delicious.  Had them at City Place and they were thin, falling apart and cold!!!  They had a ton of sour cream stacked on them - could have been to hide how thin they were.   Very sad - was looking forward to a great meal.   I guess I'll have to go to Orlando.   Better watch your quality - you're getting quite a bit of competition around you.   Almost forgot - SUPER LOUD!   Avoid if you are looking for a quiet evening or if you wear a hearing aid !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-west-palm-beach?start=120
