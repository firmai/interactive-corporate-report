Cheryl -.,"Somerset, Franklin Township, NJ",17,10,17,4.0,11/26/2017,This is Mile High mud pie at Red Robin's in South Plainfield. This is a delicious big portion of mud pie with caramel drizzle on it. It was delicious. The only issue I had with it is that my tube grand niece and nephews came over and devoured it and left me hardly any. The cookie crumb crust was really good. even though I've had better desserts at different places this is a must-have.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Bee D.,"Westfield, NJ",23,27,6,2.0,11/25/2017,"They should just go out of business at this point. I have had three bad experiences at the South Plainfield Red Robin with the food being inedible. Burned to a crisp. Not what I asked for and I am far from picky. My food was burned so bad I couldn't even eat it. I dissected it just for fun instead.  I mean does this look like a medium burger to you? Should we talk about the burned cheese fries? Or nah? I mean really? Even the bun is burned. Nothing about this has been a good experience, except the staff being nice. It used to be one of my favorite places. Now it is a place to avoid. HORRIBLE food. The staff is super friendly & always work hard. Maybe if they were paid a liveable wage, (so typical of large chain establishments), the food would be better.  Two thumbs down for the South Plainfield Red Robin. Three strikes and you're out",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Sugeidy P.,"North Riverdale, NY",116,72,101,4.0,3/6/2017,"Went here yesterday with my burgeoned for dinner. I had the Banzi burger and a 22oz Blue Moon.  Please do the same you will not regret it. They could have given some more fries, but it's ok.. the burger itself was very filling and I didn't need to get more. I highly recommend and will be back soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Mike J.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",85,429,465,3.0,2/2/2017,Got Red Robin's take out. Ordered and paid for Garlic fries with extra garlic seasoning. And ordered garlic on the side. Got home and had regular fries. Guess I need to start checking my take out ordered. Second time this has happened The teriyaki chicken was very good.

Lizzy B.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,32,2,1.0,11/17/2017,"The Manager is a rude douche bag. He was speaking down to an employee in front of customers, telling her how to pour a beer, like that's rocket science. I mentioned to my friend that he was wrong and the manager whipped around and verbally attacked me in a confrontational manor. He kept on and wouldn't let it go until I turned my back to him. The rest of the staff was nice. He needs to be taught how to be a REAL manager or maybe he needs to be replaced with a REAL manager.

Mervin M.,"Union, NJ",4,59,,1.0,12/17/2017,"What a difference seven years makes, although I've been back here sporadically between my initial review and this updated one. Last night's visit proved to be a dining debacle of epic proportions. Our 15-minute wait after giving our name to the hostess confirmed a sad fact: understaffed and ill-prepared for the holiday shopping dinner onslaught, confirmed by all the empty tables when we were seated. Burgers were dry, overdressed and falling apart, and for a burger that has a starting price tag of roughly $9, unacceptable. Our full view into the kitchen where we were seated showed a filthy mess of overflowing garbage and debris all over the floor. The capper was an erroneous charge on the bill for something we didn't have, which due to the fact that they were understaffed, added an additional 20 minutes to our ""experience"" until it was finally rectified. Shame...I used to love their burgers. I'll just need to go to Shake Shack from now on and sneak my own booze in ;^)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Marc F.,"Watchung, NJ",3,101,288,3.0,7/16/2017,"Well we thought we would stop in for lunch , last time we were here was years ago since we thought the food was trouble . We gave another shoot it was ok because of two factors the price and the staff . Burgers were nothing special or gourmet about them a standard burger patties. The garlic fries were ok nothing wow about them . Onion rings were spot on pleasure to eat .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Darren B.,"Lodi, NJ",96,17,2,5.0,8/21/2017,Was just in the non existent central Jersey area to visit a friend and we decided to stop by this Red Robin to grab a bite. At first we were skeptical but this really nice hostess named Jenny or Jamie? I forgot got us a table as soon as possible. She recommended the bottomless fries and my friend and I got milkshakes to match. The service was impeccable and the food was given to us very quickly. This however may be due to it being a Sunday but I'll take it. Never thought I'd say I'll come back to a Red Robin but I just might with this one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield

Heather B.,"Highland Park, NJ",45,27,1,3.0,8/11/2017,"The food here was good. I enjoyed my banzai burger, and the side of broccoli was cooked perfectly. But the good taste does not justify the HUGE PLASTIC CONTAINERS they give you for takeout orders. The red plastic box containing my burger was the biggest container I'd ever seen, easily enough to fit a layer cake. Within it was a smaller plastic container with my broccoli inside. The amount of plastic used prevented me from enjoying my lunch. Please take a cue from Panera or Chipotle and use sensible, recyclable packaging. Then I'll be happy to order all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Aakash G.,"New Brunswick, NJ",418,15,4,5.0,6/27/2017,"I would have honestly given this place a -0 but the twitchy waiter I had, I forgot his name like Will or bill or something made the experience great.

Jade T.,"Bergen County, NJ",218,129,380,3.0,9/4/2015,"I am SO impressed by Red Robin's new feature of providing each table with a tablet! You can place an order off the online menu (includes pictures), request your server, play games, AND pay your bill. At chains like Red Robin,  I always find myself waiting around to place an additional order or to get my waiter to bring my check... So this feature is a dream come true!! You can even split your bill based on specific items right on the tablet, which is great for large parties.  I ordered a Banzai Burger and subbed the classic steak fries for the garlic herb fries (an extra .99). I've ordered a Banzai Burger at other Red Robin locations and I liked it better elsewhere. My burger was slightly overcooked and could have used more teriyaki sauce. However, I definitely recommend the Banzai Burger if you're dining at Red Robin. Your life will be changed after trying pineapple on your burger! The garlic herb fries weren't amazing, BUT the extra flavor was definitely worth the money. The location was super clean, and as always.. I love the Red Robin décor!  My boyfriend and I only paid about $25 for two burgers AND bottomless garlic herb fries. This is the perfect spot for a cheap date night. We'll definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Emily D.,"New Brunswick, NJ",183,166,56,4.0,6/5/2016,"The food is awesome. I have found a new burger place and I'm surprised that I did not find out about this place sooner. My burger was juicy, made to perfection, and was the perfect size. Not too big that you have to take it home, but not too small where you still feel hungry afterwards. Plus, endless fries!! And their fries were amazing. Crispy, fried, golden perfect.  The waiter was a little sassy, but it's okay. He was fun. My friend ordered a milk shake and they forgot to give it to him, but besides that, none of the orders were messed up. There menu is huge with so many options that you can customize. You know, it's your average burger joint, but the burgers are really delicious. Will definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Eric B.,"South Bound Brook, NJ",35,75,1,1.0,4/24/2017,"First time I was served a burger that was red and frozen in the middle, which was surprising since it was incredibly thin. I never would have returned if not for coworkers taking me there. One ordered a fancy limited time burger that was so bad he only ate a bite. He was annoyed they didn't ask him what was wrong with it. Mine was just meh. I'd actually rather eat at burger king, and there is a Five Guys within walking distance from this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Priyeta K.,"Philadelphia, PA",188,70,24,4.0,2/8/2016,"Went here today for the first time in a while and I was pleasantly reminded as to why I always loved this place!  They have this new system where you can call your waiter over or order more drinks through a screen on your table, which I'm assuming definitely comes in handy during busy nights. It was pretty quiet tonight so my family and I didn't have to use it for that but it was great for paying when we were all finished, and the receipt even prints out the bottom right in front of you! Fast and easy so I liked it a lot.  Anywho, for appetizers I got a cup of the chicken tortilla soup and it was DELICIOUS. Nice and warm, and had so much flavor. Usually when I get this at restaurants it's too salty but this one was great. I wish I had ordered more. We also got the smaller onion ring tower, which comes with 6 large pieces and is great to share amongst two or three people. The dipping sauces are awesome. My dad got some southwest wrap and he said he liked it a lot but I didn't try it. I did try my mom's bruschetta chicken sandwich on ciabatta, which had a lot of flavor in just the one bite I took of it. I ordered their new southwest sombrero salad which was pretty good. They actually forgot to add my dressing at first so it was a tad dry but when I ordered a side of it, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The fried jalapeño pieces mixed in to the salad added a nice touch.  Had a great experience. Can't go wrong here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield
Bonnie P.,"NJ, NJ",163,25,27,4.0,6/24/2017,"We're there at dinner time so it was busy but that's fine. Our waitress (Hailey) was super nice and knowledgeable. She stayed on top of our drinks. Good came out really fast and fresh. Even though there was a mistake with my fries (I ordered sweet potato and they brought out steak fries), they fixed the mistake with absolutely no headache at all. She showed us the suggestions to entertain the 3 year old we were dining with. The location had chalk boards on the wall that you can take to your table and draw on. Hailey took the time to teach us how to use the pay machine on the table which was a super fast way to pay. We will definitely be dining there again and I hope Hailey is there when we do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield

Jessie T.,"South Plainfield, NJ",15,21,2,2.0,5/26/2016,"Awful service.  Food makes me sick afterwards.  Only burgers on the menu really.  The only saving grace is the milkshakes.  Do NOT eat the pretzels.  They're pretty gross.

Tom B.,"West Long Branch, NJ",3,48,,1.0,3/6/2016,"What a nightmare! Just went there tonight with my son.  First the good: - As this was our first time in a Red Robin, we liked to decoration. Very lively and upbeat - Hostess was friendly and had a welcoming smile - Waiter greeted us pretty quickly, taking our drink order, Our drinks arrived quickly - They offer a lot of healthier options such as wrapping your burger in a lettuce wrap instead of a bun and getting a salad or unlimited broccoli instead of fries - Salad was good and the balsamic dressing was good Now the bad - Everything in this place is about upselling you. Even the tablet on your table is about upselling - Very slow to take the order - My main complaint is that the food was terrible. I ordered a burger wrapped in lettuce. First it came out with a bun instead of wrapped in lettuce. They quickly fixed this but the toppings were all incorrect.  - My burger was cold.  I am not exaggerating.  I am not talking lukewarm.  I am talking cold.  - Even though my son ordered the unlimited broccoli, not once did they offer to refill it - In all, the burgers were nothing special at all.  We actually felt that we could have gotten the same as McD's for a lot less money - Service was minimal - This will be our last time at a Red Robin. It is a shame as we were hopeful that this place would have been really good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=40
John B.,"Pasadena, CA",762,13,,1.0,1/9/2016,"As I'm typing this, I'm waiting on a first order of ""Bottomless Fries."" The promotion should read, ""Bottomless Fries with a 20 minute wait. And then another 15."" I'm honestly impressed with the inefficiency of service on the one selling point of this restaurant. Like, I came here ONLY with the intention of eating my fill of fries. And you'd think that a burgers-and-fries joint would be competent enough to have that fryer running full-blast. Unfortunately, not so. Why am I here? What is life? To its credit, Red Robin has me contemplating the very meaning of existence, what with all the free time its given me.

It's not often that you find such a commitment to customer service. We still come here from time to time, and the burgers are usually what you'd expect- tasty.

Jeff R.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,13,3,2.0,11/27/2015,"DO NOT TOUCH THE IPADS ON THE TABLE. Red Robin is clearly hurting for cash and is competing with neighbor, Corner Bakery Cafe (see my review) for ripping people off. You so much as touch that IPad and you will buy the entire amazon gaming catalog. I think that I have a mortgage now because I touched the IPad. Waitress was nice though and refunded but apparently still needed it to pay. Also, you have to use it to call the waitress? Back in my day, as I was teaching at Rutgers, I used to slap the behinds of my students to get their attention. Today, the world is so PC but back to the food!   Mac and Cheese: Disappointing. Dry and crusty on top and lacking in cheese all over. Most forgettable dish and I have alzheimer's. Seriously, I gave three students D's for their grade because I forgot what their project was about but the great part is, my department dean was like ""Screw 'em."" God, I love Rutgers. :) Broccoli: When you're as old as I am and have fought in the Civil War (Go Confederacy!), you need your broccoli to fight in the next Civil War 2.0. Broccoli on point. Go Red Robin! :) Fish Fillet Sandwich: It was very large and somewhat acceptable for my Korean War standards. I used to fish to survive, back in my war days. I had three bullets in my leg but my desire to get back to Rutgers and teach was the only things keeping me going. This sandwich really hit my nostalgia spot. If one of my students asks me what I would recommend at Red Robin, I would probably not answer them because there is a high probability that i took the day off (when I have like 200 days off a year- Go Tenure!)

William E.,"Westford, MA",29,475,615,3.0,2/6/2015,The burgers are delicious.....don't look at the nutritional tables though.....just eat your burger / fries and move on.

Wait staff was mediocre at best - nothing over the top, nothing terrible. Burgers are great (although pretty messy when they came out), fries are alright, milkshakes are good, prices are reasonable.

Pete C.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,32,7,1.0,1/21/2016,"When they first opened 5yrs ago it was a good addition to the neighborhood.  There were some kinks in the service but they were new and we kept going back.  Over the past few years the menu has changed and the prices have nearly doubled.  And while their burgers still come with bottomless fries, the introduction (a few years ago) of the silver ring to hold the fries cut the original fry serving that comes with your burger in half.   So the $6-$7 burger that is now $10-$15 comes with less and the service is now being replaced with Electronic Tablets at the table.  Not to mention they don't put silverware or napkins at the table (last 5 visits its been the same this is not isolated) so you usually get your food and then have to catch a bus boy or someone to get forks and napkins which they will slap on your table in a pile and you can hand them out yourself. So now Red Robin wants you to place your own order, flag someone down for the essential napkins and cutlery, if you have any leftovers you will again have to flag someone down and box it up yourself, then you check out with your credit card and if you're lucky enough to even catch the name of the person that delivered your food, you're encouraged to tip 20% when you finalize your bill using the touch pad. Let's review that - you are placing your own order, there is no napkins or silverware on your table or delivered with your food, you are boxing up your own leftovers, then you are closing your order when you finish eating.  What is the wait staff doing?  And are they still only being paid waiters wages?   After swiping your credit card, there is a tip screen with a slider that defaults to 20% of the total bill.  That's 20% of the bill after tax not before tax. Seriously?  I am very generous tipper and I eat out all the time.  But what Red Robin is essentially doing is removing any personal service that you would receive when you go to a restaurant, charging a generous amount for the food and then expecting you to leave a gratuity for the service that they removed?  FAIL You got my last $100 meal for onion rings, burger with fries and softdrinks.  Call me stupid for hanging in this long but the next time the kids ask to go to red robin we'll go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=40

My GF got a regular cheeseburger (boooooring). She also had aFreckled Lemonade, it was a little too sweet for me but was really good! Remember those fries are bottomless!

I have been to Red Robin multiple times and make an effort to try something new every time.  FOOD : Something that I've only seen at Red Robin is a ramen burger. I had very high hopes for this burger after seeing it posted so much on social media and having it advertised so much. Sadly, this was very disappointing for me. The burger itself was too salty and weirdly seasoned and ramen did not act as a good burger bun as everything fell apart as soon as you picked it up. It was worth the try, but not my cup of tea. However, all the other burgers at Red Robin are delicious. I would recommend any of their gourmet burgers! Plus, the fries there are the best. PRICE : Very average for a dinner. About $10 a burger.  ATMOSPHERE : It's a family friendly place as well as a good hangout for the older audience. SERVICE : I have always found the staff at Red Robin to be very pleasant. I've never had a bad  experience. Red Robin also has a new system where you have tablet that you can order some food and ask for attention from a waiter. You also pay on this machine if it's by credit card and it makes splitting checks very easy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=20
Bill M.,"Highland Park, NJ",185,110,82,1.0,6/22/2015,"I came here for dinner with my gf who had a gift card that was credited to her as a result of previously poor service. I believe in 2nd food chances and I really like burgers from Red Robin so I was hopeful that our local iteration could redeem itself. If they could even be half as good as the fantastic Hershey, Penna Red Robin, I would have been pleased.  After eating here yesterday, I'm shocked that this particular Red Robin is still in business.  The first issue I had with this Red Robin smacked me right in the face when I walked in. There wasn't a hostess. We were milling around for 5 mins before someone came out and offered us a table. There were plenty of servers and even the manager was there. It was Sunday ~6pm. There is no reason to have the front of the place totally unmanned.  Then I sit down in a greasy sticky table. There were plenty of open seats. I don't know why the hostess decided I needed to sit in the dirty booth.  Our waitress came over and took our drink order and our food order without a hitch. Unfortunately after that,  things really went off the rails. I checked in to Red Robin as soon as I got seated. I took a screen shot of my check in while I was sitting there, without food 45 minutes later. It took over an hour for the waitress to come back and tell us that our food would be out shortly.  Eventually the food came out, delivered by another staff member. This is fine but the waitress should really come over and check on us when the food comes out. My fries were cold. Maybe they were waiting over an hour for my cheeseburger as well.  Also, I ordered my burger well done. If my burger were a new born it would have been a girl, because it was pink! Is it really that hard to cook and serve burgers and fries? Red Robin isn't a place that I'm accustomed to waiting a long time for food to come out. The entire menu is burgers and fries.  There is no earthly reason there should be over an hour wait sitting for food at your table.  The icing on the cake was that our waitress didn't check on us until I finished my food. No refills at all. What a shame, since Red Robin can be great if it is run by someone who knows how to run a restaurant.  Luckily there are plenty of other better burger options virtually right next door. Smashburger and Five guys are better tasting, cheaper, and faster and both down the street. If you want a sit down burger with a drink, I would go to Brick House around the corner EVERY time over this particular Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=20

Cherisse S.,"East Orange, NJ",1,9,11,2.0,7/5/2016,"We waited a long time for our burgers cooked medium and a turkey burger. Both came out over cooked. Regular burger well done and turkey burger burnt and dry. The waitress said that they were under staffed to explain the long wait and as far as the turkey burger she said that it is normal, all their turkey burgers come out like that because they have to make sure that it's cooked all the way through. Really? Manager came over and admitted turkey burger was ""overcooked"" and at this point my appetite was gone so i did not order anything to replace my meal. Garlic fries was good, though. Staff education is key! P.S. asked for drinks to go waitress brought back empty cup and half filled cup with left over drinks. Manager took care of everything.

Sandy C.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",239,22,10,5.0,5/18/2016,"Red Robin is a hidden gem.  Everything in this S.Plainfield location feels updated.  They have these fancy point-of-sales screens at your table so you can order food, call the server, or even pay/split the bill. Everything on the menu is really updated as well.  Heck they even have a ramen burger and a croissant donut tower.  Seriously hats off to corporate for really staying in touch with the times and being creative with the menu. Execution of all their food is good.  No sloppiness from the kitchen.  Servers are attentive and friendly.  Managers are always present and visible. The one thing I don't like is that this location is literally right next to the LA fitness gym that I go to so I have serious guilt issues to deal with when I eat my burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=20

Felix S.,"Flushing, NY",220,203,981,3.0,4/9/2015,"The only thing you know about Red Robin is their bottomless fries. Burger is not really your thing cause it's too greasy neither are fries. Only reason you go to chain restaurants is because your party is too big for a regular normal restaurant. And you don't want to be a party pooper so you tag along. If you answer YES to the above statements, please proceed ahead- To be quite honest- I'm really not a big fan of burgers and fries- maybe it's because I had a bad food poisoning experience at a burger joint a couple of years back but I think it's mainly because my tummy have PTS and can't handle things that are too greasy (PTS- Princess Tummy Syndrome) so when my church decided to head over to Red Robin for lunch, I so wanted to say NO I'm not going (again PTS kicked in hard) but in the end I decided to join. Really the only thing I know about Red Robin is for their fries and I never though too much about their burgers until this visit in NJ. ( I usually go to the one in Westbury) Our group of about 25 people came on a Sunday afternoon at around 2:00pm and since we had a large party, we waited for about 40 mins to get seated. Decor and Ambiance: very similar to the other Red Robins, sports bar style, you see LCD tv everywhere in the restaurant, there's a big bar right in the front along with some arcade machines for the kids.  Restaurant is filled with many sport memorabilia and pictures of famous sports players.  Very casual and loud but nothing crazy that you can't hear the person next to you. However, cleanness is questionable as the floor was a bit sticky and the bathroom definitely needed some cleaning.  Restaurant seating are mostly booth with some high tables by the sports bar.  Very spacious and the place can easily accommodate 100+ people.  I think Red Robin really upped their game since my last visit because I do not remember seeing so many gourmet burgers the last time I was around.  There are so many choices on the menu that I don't know where to start. Actually I do know since I'm such a big egg head, the one burger that caught my attention right away is the Royal Red Robin (BLT cheeseburger with an egg on top), who wouldn't like that??  There were so many options to choose from but in the end, my favorites are: Towering Onion Rings- Served with Campfire sauce and ranch dressing. Onion Rings are really nothing extraordinary but these are GOOD, FRESHLY GOOD! Definitely made to order because I burnt my lips biting into one of these things! They are crispy and crunchy on the outside and onion is soft on the inside (unlike some places where their onion is still hard and un-chewable), fried to golden brown and the campfire sauce (kinda taste like chipotle sauce) was a great compliment to the onion rings.  The presentation reminded us why we don't play ring toss with our food (had a few onion rings causalities)  Royal Red Robin- Of course I have to go there, I said it before and I'll say it again: EGG MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER! To my surprise, the burger was perfectly cooked, medium, juice blasting and flavorful just the way I like it, bacon was well executed, crispy yet still have some chewiness to it but the EGG was money, it is the binder of it all, what a beautiful sight to watch as the yolk slowly infuses the burger with it's juicy, creamy goodness. Your first bite was WOA, flavor texture overload! You got the juicy burger, crunch from bacon, coolness from the lettuce and tomato and finish it off with the creaminess of the yolk... DANG EXCELLENT and DELICIOUS!! MUST TRY!! Chili Chili Cheeseburger-  If you don't the mess and are into super big flavor then you can't go wrong with the Chili Chili Cheeseburger.  Cheeseburger with double chili on top, yes it's going to be messy but dang it's so flavorful, kinda makes you question how much beef do you need in a cheeseburger but whatever! You have the cheeseburger, topped with Chili- not too salty, got a good kick in the end with bits and pieces of raw onion plus the chipotle sauce.  What more do you want on your burger? DEFINITELY MUST TRY! Service: Decent service, the bottomless fries came out pretty slow and at the end, we were only able to get about 2 rounds of fries but our server was friendly and on top of things! Price: Average: Most gourmet burgers will run you around $10- $12 dollar plus drink you are looking at around $15 for a complete meal but it's pretty good consider their burgers definitely hit the spot and you might even get two meal out of it (remember bottomless fries). Overall: I had a much better experience at Red Robin this time around, the food was fresh and delicious, service was good and price was reasonable.  They definitely upped their game since the last time I was here and if you haven't been to Red Robin for a while, now it's a good time to give it another shot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=20
Yuppi C.,"Manchester Township, NJ",3,227,50,2.0,4/18/2016,"My friend and I had been wanting to go here for awhile now. The interior was bright and clean. Seemed well organized behind the bar. My friend had a tavern burger, but the larger one. I had the Ghost Pepper burger and added an egg. They were average. I've also had the Ghost Pepper burger at Quakersteak and while I like Quakersteak's food better, I liked the Ghost Pepper burger better at Red Robin because it was spicier. We also had Nachos. They were alright, but not worth the $9 price tag. The burgers were too small for the price. A few weeks ago they had a deal where it was two burgers (limited to certain burgers) and a small appetizer for $15. Upgrade to a full appetizer for like $2 more or something. That would have been a good deal. They have bottomless fries, but the amount they give you per serving is too small. You're done in a few minutes and need to ask for more, only the waitress is nowhere around. Service was poor. The waitress did not ask if we needed any drink refills. There's a tablet computer on the table which we could order from, call the waitress and pay our bill. When we first sat down the waitress said ""Oh you can order Nachos in the tablet"" and she went ahead and did it for us, but the rest of the tablet was not explained to us. We didn't realize we could call the waitress. We would have left sooner, but we were sitting around waiting for our check. We also didn't know that we need to request a check through the tablet. Maybe if the burgers were better and lower priced I could overlook the service, but I definitely won't be back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=20

I got the fish and chips but substituted for sweet potato dries. Yes I know odd combo but love those fries over the steak fries. But you have to get the campfire sauce to dip. Yum.  It was lunch time and mind you you would think it would be crazy and it was not. Sat me right aways tables were clean. Manager also came to see how everything was which was very nice.

Menu is mostly burgers (beef, chicken, and a few veggie options). A smattering of pastas, salads, and grilled dishes round it out but...I wouldn't - it's a self processed burger joint and a chain, anything you order that isn't a burger was probably frozen or came out of a can. All of their burgers/wraps come in just below 10$ and come with unlimited fries. They're not mindblowing or anything, but they are good and there are a ton of options for toppings.  Milkshakes, lemonade (free refills on that one), and a bevy of alcoholic beverages fill out the drink portion of the menu.

Erica L.,"Manhattan, NY",193,184,975,5.0,3/31/2012,"I LOVE RED ROBIN. I don't care that it is a chain; it is delicious. It is one thing that I really wish New York City had, so I wouldn't have to wait to go home to New Jersey just to have it again. When I was in college and visited my friends at Rutgers, we would always go to Red Robin. It would instantly put me in a good mood. I'm getting excited just writing this review.  In addition to a burger, you must always get a freckled lemonade and garlic parm fries. They are both BOTTOMLESS. The freckled lemonade comes with strawberries in it, and it is the perfect combo of sweet and tangy. The garlic parm fries are big steak fries stuffed with potatoes and topped with shredded parmesan and drizzled with garlicky goodness. I came here with my best friend for the first time several years ago. We both wanted freckled lemonade but figured that we would share one since it was bottomless. The waiter was so nice and just brought us out two freckled lemonades but only charged us for one, which was so thoughtful and actually makes a lot of sense. This would prevent him from having to refill our glasses more often. We tried to do this in future visits, but the waiters refused and were actually confused. If only we had that waiter that first time ... My favorite burger is the whiskey river bbq burger: whiskey river bbq sauce, cheddar cheese, cripsy onion straws, lettuce, and mayo. It is always cooked to perfection and is oozing with flavor. The crispy onion straws give it texture, and the the barbecue sauce just adds the icing to the cake. It is a safe choice for a yummy meal. I have a tried a few of the others as well: - the sauteed shroom burger (sauteed mushrooms, garlic parmesan butter, melted swiss): pretty standard burger. No complaints here. - A.1. peppercorn burger (applewood smoked bacon, melted pepper-jack cheese, A.1. peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws on an onion bun): very flavorful. I was surprised how tasty this actually was. - royal red robin burger (applewood smoked bacon, american cheese, lettuce, mayo, and a fried egg): surprisingly disappointing considering it features the name of the restaurant, so it should be a classic burger that everyone would enjoy. I love fried eggs and adding them to sandwiches, but this burger actually tasted like something you could get at any boring burger joint. I was not impressed at all. I often see other tables order the towering onion rings and long to order it as well, but I know it would be way too much food. I want to try everything on the menu because it looks and sounds so good (whoever does the photography for their menus does an excellent job because the pictures of the food all make me salivate), but I need to have my burger, fries, and freckled lemonade every time. The only complaint I have is that when it is busy (which is often), the service can be somewhat slow. I always leave here with food coma, but at least my tummy is super satisfied. Prices are reasonable, and that's why I come here time and time again. I cannot use enough superlatives to describe Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=60

This was a great deal as it was only $5, and came with homemade chips as well! My husband tried a new burger on the menu, the southern charm with bottomless fries. I ordered the tavern double with bottomless fries. His was very good and I recommend the tavern double because it's smaller but filling and only $6.99 with the fries.

As a purist I prefer a nice medium-well patty slightly pink, smoke flavored, and a nice burger sauce.  Toasted buns.  Their patty was just ok, very greasy not juicy enough because they cook them well done.

Luckily I found out that there is one in South Plainfield not too far from my bf. He decided to take me there for my first time this past weekend.  Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. Everything on the menu looked delish, but we both decided to order burgers. And to my surprise I found out that the fries and select drinks were bottomless, every fast foodies dream!  For an appetizer, we ordered the RR's Buzzard Wings ($8.99) which came in a fiery Cayenne Pepper Sauce. This was mainly for my bf since I'm not a spicy food fan. I did manage to try one wing which was okay. My bf ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger  w/ Sweet Pot Fries ($8.79) and a Classic Chocolate Milkshake ($2.99). The Sweet Pot Fries came with a dipping sauce which seemed to be a mix of Ketchup and the Thai spicy sauce, Srisacha.

Arielle M.,"Hackettstown, NJ",15,52,,4.0,3/4/2013,"Unlimited fries is a dangerous thing. My boyfriend's got a real love affair with Red Robin restaurants that started long before I ever met him.  When he found out there was one within 15 minutes of us, we headed there right away.  The restaurant is usually crowded for dinner, especially when you go on a weekend.  This past Friday we were seated at a table that shared a wall with the bar, sandwiched between two large tables with kids--one of which had calm, behaving kids, and the other had screamers who darted between the table and the small video arcade at the front of the restaurant. In addition to this noise, the bar's ice-crushing margarita machine was right behind my head, giving me a headache and making it impossible to have a conversation. This is definitely not the place for a conventional date night. But I really can't complain for the tasty, relatively cheap burgers you get here.  There's such a variety that I'm sure you'll find something to fit your taste.  I like the Bleu Ribbon Burger, which has steak sauce and bleu cheese crumbles, and my boyfriend satisfied his RR craving with a Banzai Burger, which has pineapple slices and teriyaki sauce.  There are other options besides burgers, but just like you don't go to a seafood restaurant and order the chicken, you don't come to Red Robin for their salads.  Each burger comes with unlimited French fries, seasoned with their spicy ""Cajun"" seasoning.  We each got two orders of fries and felt like they had to roll us out of the restaurant, Violet Beauregard-style.  BF's a fan of their onion ring tower with the three different dipping sauces, and it's fun and kitschy, but I don't think their onion rings are anything to write home about, and if I'm getting another deep-fried side dish for free (the unlimited fries), I don't see ordering something extra as well. This place only gets a star off because of the noise level (which is understandable since it's a family restaurant, but I couldn't even hear myself think).  Red Robin definitely satisfies burger cravings but good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=100

Inspector P.,"Morganville, NJ",0,32,13,4.0,12/13/2011,"Just joined yelp but have been to the SP RR probably three dozen times since it opened in 2006.  The turnover is unbelievable, I rarely even see the same server twice.  The burgers are creative and really tasty, that's the most important thing to know.  Beyond that, most of the nits I could share I just write to  , I don't really want to discourage you from trying this place just because  each of the last 3 times there I waited a rather long time to get a drink refill.   It is in the survey you take ""did the server refill the drink without you having to ask."" I am really not one to make a scene or call for the manager so instead I share on websites.  Have not really tried their happy hour and just joined their loyalty program, which may soon be offering a key ring swipe card instead of a full thick credit sized card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=100
Tim B.,"Hoboken, NJ",36,73,20,1.0,3/3/2013,Horrible. Ordered a burger no cheese no mayo. Burger comes out with mayo. I send it back and they flip the same burger so the mayo is hidden and give it back to me. Red Robin is dead to me now. Wish there was a zero star option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=100
Kim R.,"Canton, ME",23,84,,5.0,8/2/2011,One of my favorite chain burger places...the guacamole burger is heaven and fries are always good. Freckled lemonade yummm w bottomless refills score.

Michael K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4,23,,5.0,12/27/2010,"Step aside Five Guys: we have a new winner in town. Unlike many inexpensive burger joints, Red Robin doesn't assume you want your burger well-done: they are perfectly happy cooking their burgers medium or medium-rare. The burger itself is juicy, delicious, and conveniently wrapped in paper to make it easy to hold. Served on the side is a bottomless basket of crispy steak fries that are perfect after some light seasoning. While the waitstaff is relatively young, I have never had a problem. Even when busy, service is quick and the waiters and waitresses keep the drinks topped off and the baskets of fries full. P.S. Be sure to try the root beer float. It is delicious and a great value considering that refills are free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=100
Rose C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,98,1,2.0,5/2/2013,"My introduction to Red Robin came in Southern California and I was very pleasantly surprised. I used to have abhorrence for all things chain restaurant but Red Robin provided a delectable meal and that's the truth. I became hooked on the Bleu Cheese burger, the perfect combination of succulent charbroiled meat and zesty cheese. Oh my God, don't get me started - it was that good. So we checked out this Red Robin on impulse. My spouse had the Prime Chophouse and wasn't as into it as I expected, said mine was better (of course, I ordered the Bleu again). The fries are good and crispy and you can't lose with them being bottomless. I thought $2.99 was too expensive for a small kid's milkshake (and it was quite small) but aside from that, I think their menu prices are fair. The problem is this particular Red Robin really fell short in the service department. We stood around waiting for a table for almost 15 minutes while the majority of the place was empty, literally empty tables all around. Also, we requested a booth and were told we could not have one because that waitress would be leaving soon. What difference does it make? The booth we wanted was literally 10 feet away from where we wound up sitting. Go figure. Then it took a very long while to take our orders and then an even longer while to get our food. Once the food arrived, we realized we had not been given any napkins or silverware (we had ordered sides of cole slaw, etc. so we needed forks). We sat there unnoticed until I got up to speak to someone who happened by (she didn't look too happy either). I asked for water and the waitress brought me just that - one water. Seemed to me that she should have just brought waters for the three of us, but ok, fine. Our waitress was a young, blonde girl and it didn't seem like she was new. Then when we asked for additional sodas (right after we ordered dessert for everyone), she brought us new sodas but left the old empty glasses sitting there crowding up the table. This just seemed very unprofessional to me. I got fed up and grabbed the dirty glasses and just stuck them on a nearby table. Whatever. I could understand if the place was packed but it wasn't. So I'm giving this Red Robin experience two stars even though I love their food. The service was so poor it came very close to ruining the meal even with that incredible chocolate cake with the vanilla icecream and strawberry syrup and that's saying a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=120
Tracy H.,"South Plainfield, NJ",7,34,,3.0,10/22/2009,I love the onion ring tower and the never ending strawberry lemonade! Being a vegetarian this was all I could really eat from this place.  It has a great atmosphere and the service was fast and friendly. Great place to get some apps and hang out with friends or even bring a family for dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=120
Loren L.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,,1.0,2/6/2013,"I really like Red Robin's menu and usually enjoy dining there, however my last couple of visits to THIS location were VERY DISAPPOINTING.  The service was POOR!!  The server forgot my appetizer and the food took over 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  The server didn't explain the reason for the delay until AFTER the food came out (by that time, who cares?) and the manager told me he would email me some form of comp meal to make up for my inconvenience...it never arrived in my email.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=120
Leslie C.,"New Providence, NJ",0,4,,5.0,8/3/2012,Love Red Robin. The burgers are excellent. They are always prompt with their service and drink refills. Love the choice of toppings and buns so you can customize your burger. Their chicken is also great. It is definitely a favorite restaurant of ours and we are going tomorrow!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=120
Pelikanyo P.,"Westfield, NJ",0,32,,1.0,11/3/2008,"I was surprised to see a Red Robin in NJ...just happened upon this one and thought I'd give it a try. While the help, was all very nice, the food was awful. Burgers were tasteless, and the fries soggy and LOADED with salt. Salad was decent, but small. Won't try this one again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=120
Geoff Y.,"New York, NY",64,173,14,3.0,7/10/2008,"Meh, it's an ok place.  It's another one of those themed restaurants, this one specializing in burgers.  It's a little more expensive than it should be, but I guess you're paying the wages for the actor who walks around dressed like the robin too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=120
Matthew S.,"Hillsborough, NJ",28,156,221,3.0,4/27/2011,"The burgers here are definitely very good. It's a chain restaurant and they don't try to hide it. Service is ok.  They offer bottomless steak fries with all fo their sandiwiches which I have defiantley taken advantage of.  Plenty of seating at the inside table or at the bar and if it's nicer out take advantage of the outdoor seating although it is very limited.  My biggest problem is the food is just terrible for you. Now don't get me wrong I know that a burger joint isn't going to be healthy, but if you look at there nutritional info its just downright awful.  I mean some of the burgers have your full days worth of calories and sodium in it.  But if your looking to eat healthy your probaly not at Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=120
