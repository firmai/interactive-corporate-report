Was disappointed at what came out here though. The bacon was undercooked and not as much cheese. Just tasted like something was missing.  Also got the boneless buffalo wings and triple dipper platter that I got sliders, honey chipotle crispers, and southwestern egg rolls for the selections. The sliders were and southwestern egg rolls were good. Tasted exactly like the chili's in us. The honey chipotle wings they came out without the honey chipotle sauce Haha they had to take it back and they just poured a little of the sauce on it instead of preparing it correctly. For the boneless wings I ordered half mango habanero and half orange Bbq. They brought out the plate with only a flavor of honey chipotle. Far from what I had ordered.  Food took a while to come out also and it was empty when we came in. There was only one other party there besides us. So don't think I'll be coming back unless someone is craving chili's. Will go to cabanna upstairs instead from now on when I come to this area. Usually go to cabanna but wanted my girl to try something new that she hasn't tried, but she was also disappointed. I was excited to share the chili's experience with her but now she doesn't want to come back anymore lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tijuana,,,,,
