Sira V.,"Conroe, TX",13,88,338,4.0,11/28/2017,"Sometimes you want a sit-down-and-be-served burger. Not take out or drive through. Not ""place this on the edge of your table"" and not ""we'll call your number."" You want to sit down and have your order taken and your order is how you want your burger.  Red Robin does this and it does this pretty well. How do you want your burger? What do you want on your burger? The menu has plenty of options and combinations. But I think of this as just a list of suggestions. Let your stomach guide your imagination. Don't want a burger? There's a little of just about everything on the menu to please you or your non-burger eating companions.  Just don't forget to get a malted milkshake. Ohhmmmm... soda fountain made.  My experience is that the waitstaff are very friendly and ready to offer suggestions or recommendations. They're also patient because taking in the menu all at once can take a while.  Fine dining? No. But for the selection and the prices, it's well enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah
Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699,3.0,6/4/2017,"It is a chain restaurant people!  The only thing that normally changes from one chain spot to the next is the quality of service.  Here is an adapted version of Red Robins that I wrote to fit my experience at this particular branch of the chain: You know how I am behind chain restaurants!  I will admit that my server was extremely attentive.  I'm a huge fan of them having their own seasoning salt at the table because that means you have a possibility of actually having flavored food! I'm also a fan of having many unlimited options.  That includes some fruit, salad and even the fries. Most cool was the unlimited root beer floats for $5! Fries come in a few flavors and you can get premium sauces for dipping.  This time we ordered a Jump Starter Double...we picked the fried zucchini bites and fried jalapeno coins.  All in all, you had a decent amount of each to hit the table, and the dipping sauces provided were an adequate taste companion to the dish.  Neither the appetizer nor sauces were blow your socks off good. I ordered the Mac Tavern Burger, and all in all, the burger was a lot smaller than what I would expect for a burger.  I thought if you are offering a burger with macaroni and cheese on it, you should have mounds of it oozing off the entire burger, but there were barely any sights of it on the small patty!  In regards of taste, the burgers did have character, but nothing to truly right home about.  The menu truly is extensive. You can get salmon, burgers, chicken, under 600 calorie meals, etcetera.  Just for the record, I recommend signing up for their email club.  Had I opted to not dine in, they would have given me 35% off my bill via the email promotion.  Honestly, you have to love the concept of bottomless fries and bottomless drinks. Having unlimited options will ensure you leave full.  Come find something to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah
Kevin V.,"Spring, TX",45,138,257,5.0,5/4/2017,Walked into red Robin and was greeted promptly upon arrival. I'm excited to see the new menu changed They've made. Bottomless broccoli instead of fries and they've also added salmon and brought back salads!!! The wait time for the food is a little lengthy so if you're on a lunch break i would suggest calling in 20 to 30 minutes in advance or choose another place to dine.

Renee Y.,"Spring, TX",46,106,1,5.0,10/21/2017,I went here with my man last night. Chelsea was our waitress and she was just wonderful! I haven't had service like that in such a long time. We split pretzel bites with beer cheese. We got extra cheese for $1.50 for the bites and fries. I got the Southern Charmer with our pickles or onions. It was amazing.

Pamela F.,"Dayton, TX",66,61,21,5.0,3/8/2017,"I am currently 6 months pregnant and the cravings for Red Robin were intense!  So my husband and I met a friend for an early dinner and it was fantastic! Our server's name was Colleen and she was great! Super sweet and attentive. Gave some good appetizer suggestions (when in doubt go Onion Rings!). Our friend got the strawberry lemonade and it looked amazing. Real chunks of strawberries! I'm gonna have to try it next time! For food I ordered the Keep it Simple but my husband and our friend ordered the Royal Robin. We all got fries. That burger was so delicious it seriously hit the spot! The major craving was their French fries and I had three portions. Thank you Red Robin for having bottomless fries! If you aren't a huge fan of French fries they have Sweet Potato fries, a fruit salad and broccoli and all of those are bottomless as well. If you pass on the onion rings ask for a side of the sauce that comes with them and you won't be disappointed! I can't wait to go back! French fries here I come!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah
FoodMakes M.,"Houston, TX",1,88,28,4.0,10/21/2017,"I have been going to this establishment well over 10 years.  The service and food is typically consistent with only a few snafus along the way.  I miss one of the managers that used to be here for the longest because she truly worked with her staff to make sure the customer needs were met (ex. she'd bring refill drinks and fries without having to ask the customer or server).  My visits have lessened as the prices went up and the burgers got smaller.  However, I always enjoy a good Whiskey River or Blue Cheese burger.  I'm trying to keep the calories in check, so I just wanted a smaller burger my last visit.  I tried the Tavern Jack and was pleased with the two double patties and flavor.  It was just the right size to enjoy all my food without feeling like I ate too much.  Again, the basket of fries are small for a bottomless establishment.  However, they try to keep them hot, fresh, and coming.  Drink refills were also speedy.  I will say the service was a bit slow on my last visit.  The hostess was backed up and took a few minutes that waiting customers were confused who had been attended to as they were walking in waiting too.  And no matter what is going on, all restaurants should at a minimum stop by to get a drink order within the first 5 minutes of someone being seated.  I would like to see an improvement in those areas on the next visit, but it is typically not an issue when I have gone in the past.  If you're looking for a decent burger without breaking the bank, stop in and get one of the tavern options....all others will run you $10+ easily...but for $8 you can have a good size burger and unlimited (if asked at just the right time) fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah

I ordered the very berry limeade soda which I could not get enough of!  Yummy!!  I drank three of them, so you can imagine my appetite was quite suppressed . . .  I did not care, and I ordered the chili chili cheeseburger with extra onions and the bottomless sweet potato fries. The burger comes out with no onions . .. but the server quickly noticed and got a side of onions for me. The chili was good, I ate around the burger because I was already full, but eventually took a few bites and the burger was pretty good. The fries were slightly overcooked or maybe not freshly fried, but that did not bother me as my stomach was full of limeade.  Ha!!!  Cute place for a burger, lively atmosphere, service ok.  I would go back again, but will try not to drink too much limeade soda again!  Awesome for young families with small children.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah

I am always pleasant and courteous to the staff when picking up an order, but it doesn't matter to them I am still treated like a 2nd class citizen. The employees and manager have spoken to me in a rude tone and given me dirty looks as soon as I let them know I'm picking up an order for DoorDash.

Tammy C.,"Kent, WA",118,138,89,2.0,4/24/2012,"First, I wonder if Red Robin management read Yelp reviews.  If so, I hope they read mine. Second, Red Robin is a Washington State staple.  We are very familiar with the product and service. Also, having been in the service industry we do know the ins and outs of service, front of house and also Red Robin service policy. We were fortunate enough to be promptly greeted and found a booth in the bar.  The bartender was also our server and when I pulled up my Yelp app to check in I showed her the low rating the Dirty Bird has.  Her immediate response was the typical Yelp is just for haters.  I informed her of my love for Yelp and how we have been relying on it since moving to a new area and actually found Yelp to be fairly accurate. Anyhooo... We ordered a promotional bacon burger and my current fave, the chicken caprese sandwich.  Soooo good and moist! Our beers were cold and our fries came out crispy like we asked. So what was the issue? Watching the front of the house. GROSS. We watched the following: * A server pull off his shoe and place his hand deeply inside said shoe. Searching deeper and deeper. A well-worked in shoe and his foot on the floor. * A waitress chatting up and completely distracting the hostesses all while she drank a milkshake from a glass. In uniform... On the clock. * Same waitress fanning her tip money.  * Hostess completely ignoring costumers. Not even a smile. Well, you get the idea. It was all just really bad form.

When I say crave, I mean I passed up the Red Robin, drove around to see if anything else would fill my craving, then doubled back around to Red Robin. Well boy was I dissatisfied...or should I say disgusted. My BF and I both ordered Blue Moons on draft. The first thing I noticed was no orange slice... I figured ok whatever... But when I was about to take a 2nd sip of my beer I noticed something small and black floating in my beer. A bug. It was a bug... But not just any bug, to my delight it was a baby ROACH. Why I didn't get up and leave at that moment is beyond me. My BF picked it out and told the waiter and he brought me a new beer. I played it off all cool because I had really hyped this place up. Enter burger: my burger tasted good, it was a bacon cheeseburger, in which you can't really mess up. Until you find a LONG HAIR EMBEDDED IN YOUR BURGER!  Yup, that's what happened. I pulled out the longest hair imaginable out of my mouth. Disgusting.  Furthermore, my BF said his Lone Star burger had chunks of salt in it. Unbearably salty.

Felicia C.,"Conroe, TX",256,128,191,2.0,7/3/2016,"I try to be positive in my reviews - I believe most restaurants are in business to provide a pleasant meal to appreciative diners - but this visit was just awful. Our burgers were overcooked to the point of being hard and dry. They don't want to make rare burgers anymore - I get it - but these were ridiculous. They may have started out as 1/4 pound patties but they ended up as three-ounce sawdust cakes. Seriously. My Lone Star Burger had blue cheese on it. If you're expecting pepper jack and get ambushed with a mouthful of blue cheese instead, there's no way to really recover from that. Any flavor from the guacamole and veggies was completely overpowered. Had our server checked back even once I'd have asked them to remake it. By the time we got his attention we were ready for the check. He said he would ask about taking it off the check (eventually they did) but we waited fifteen minutes for him to come back. It was obvious the chicken strips were overcooked from their dark brown color and sure enough they also were hard and dry. A basket of fries - unbelievably- had both hot fresh fries and cold ones from a different batch. Inexcusable. I ordered Dr. Pepper, my companion ordered unsweetened tea, and we both were served watery sweet tea instead. Another five minutes getting our server's attention to bring the right drinks and yet another five minutes until they came to our table. There just wasn't anything good about the meal but I'm giving two stars because, at least, everything appeared clean. That's the best I can do on this one. It'll be a long time before I feel like going back to another Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=20
Sara D.,"Conroe, TX",21,21,13,5.0,2/6/2015,My son insists on going every time we say we are going out to eat. If we are in the mood for something else we pretty much have to bribe the kid...

Lindsey M.,"Vista, CA",205,252,321,3.0,3/31/2014,"A Chilis comparable!? Red Robin is casual dining with one of those confusing themes but decent burgers! Endless steak fries is without a doubt my favorite option on the menu! Our server, David, helped improve the overall experience. With his sense of humor and friendly demeanor, every visit by him to our table was pleasant and fun! My burger, the Red Robin cheeseburger, with the patty a little pink as per my request, was tasty and filling. I had to box that sucker up and take the remainder of it home; the burger was enormous! My sister got a Freckled Lemonade to drink, THAT on appearance alone looked fabulously delicious! Mmmm, strawberries! As my first culinary impression of Houston, TX post-arriving at the airport, it was a-okay!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=20
Bobby P.,"Humble, TX",60,4,7,2.0,9/5/2015,Freckled lemonade was the best! Service was great ! Fries were good and they asked if I wanted more! BUT ..... Whataburger Fuddruckers if you want a burger.

Shawn L.,"Conroe, TX",20,53,44,4.0,3/7/2015,"I am hooked on these burgers! Love adding the ghost pepper sauce to my burger and using the extra to mix with my ketchup for a spicy kick. They have a decent beer selection but if they could double the number of choices they have on draft I would probably give them 5 stars.  My wife and I have been to this location several times, sometimes just us, a couple times with my five year old and every visit has been great. We usually sit in the bar area, it seems more intimate and less crowded than the main area. I probably would give a lower rating if I always sat in the main dining area, it just seems a bit open and cafeteria like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=20
Bruce N.,"Spring, TX",4,51,4,4.0,9/6/2014,"We finally decided to try Red Robin because nothing else really sounded good at the time.  We went in and got sat quickly, it was clean, and they didn't put the rolled silverware on top of the menu! That is a very big deal to my wife.  So looking at the menu they have fish & chips. No one ever told us that. We have to drive downtown to get that. So yes, we both order Fish&Chips at a gourmet burger joint. It was really good. Cooked perfectly. It didn't taste frozen or anything, we will be back.  Maybe I'll try a burger sometime and report back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=20

L C.,"Dallas, TX",0,33,,2.0,8/24/2016,"Very friendly bartender who took my order.    Unfortunately, the kitchen staff doesn't seem to be as attentive.   I ordered a quacamole bacon burger, which based upon the name should have 3 items -- a burger, bacon, and guacamole.   Unfortunately, there was no guacamole. Per the menu it should have swiss cheese, but what I got had that nasty orange American cheese that looks like what comes out of a cellophane wrapper.   I could have gotten a burger that was twice as good for half the price at either Whataburger or Karls Jr.   Lesson learned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=20

Jamie M.,"Spring, TX",333,329,450,3.0,7/1/2012,"Red Robin, I feel like if you have been to one you have pretty much experienced them all minus the variation and quality of service. I've frequented the Red Robin's in California, and they are a restaurant chain that always strikes me as a mediocre establishment.  The bottomless carbs, errm steak fries dusted with their Red Robin seasoning and ketchup are probably the hook that draws me in. But again its a chain, I love local mom and pop, but for a middle of the roads chain it's not all bad, nor good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=20
Dee K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",248,493,1607,5.0,5/6/2014,"I heart red robbin. As far as burger joints go, i love their fresh juicy flavorful burgers- something for everyone. I have a friend who only eats gluten free and she can eat at red robbin,  i dig the unlimited fries, onion ting tower, burgers with green chile and drinks- love that cocorita on the rocks- creamy and fresh tasting with chunks of coconut to make u feel like you are on an island and ... Not in the woodlands. Sit on the patio now that the weather is so fab. Great for groups of friends, happy hours, kids, lunch, dinner whatever. The service is great and food is consistently good.

The service was perfect, not intrusive but I could tell Chad was walking by and checking. I didn't really look at the menu, but took Chad's recommendation and was thrilled. Had the Jim Beam burger and garlic Parmesan fries and it was killer! Wished I had one closer but I'd weigh 500 lbs if I did.

Michelle a.,"Spring, TX",58,5,3,5.0,4/18/2014,"Endless steak fries, that's what gets us every time!  We frequent this Red Robin because the food is good but more importantly, the waiter we always request is top notch!  Dan is the best waiter they have there and we're sad that he is leaving however super proud because he's joining the Army.   Unfortunately, the other wait staff that we've had, donot live up to my standards.  What can I say, I expect someone in the service industry to have great customer service! Now, I haven't had every waiter there so I can't say everyone is not that great.  However we've had a few and they do not compare, in any shape or form, to Dan!  Now for the food, I can't say that they have the best burgers around however they are good and if you go with the Tavern Double, you can't beat the price.  Try their new cheese fries, they are delicious.  The secret sauce is what makes it. Remind us of animals fries from In-N-Out except with bacon!  If you go on Saturday evening, ask for Dan!  It's his last day and the last time you'll get to experience his awesomeness!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=60

Matthew B.,"Spring, TX",18,14,2,5.0,8/27/2011,"We started out with the tower of onion rings.  They were cooked perfectly, and the chipotle sauce that came with them was amazing!  I had the royal burger and although I prefer my fried egg just a bit runny, it was a really well made burger, didn't fall apart and wasn't too big to finish.  My wife had the mac and cheese with riblets and although the mac and cheese was good, she prefers her more on the creamy side and this was more of a noodles with cheese on them kind of mac and cheese. Our little girl had the corn dog and oranges and she inhaled them.  She is a picky eater so when we can find something that she does not pick at and actually eats, we are sold!  My MIL had the party melt on marble rye and said that it was the best she has had in a long time.  We finished off the night with the Apple bites.  The only way that the Apple bites could have been any better was if they could have put it in a vanilla shake or malt!  lol.   Kevin was our waiter and he was on top of his game.  Our food came out quick, our drinks were always full and all of this was at the busy dinner time.  We will be back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=60
