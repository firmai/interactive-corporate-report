CJ O.,"Escondido, CA",1,12,3,5.0,1/12/2018,"Been coming to Chilis for 10 years! Favorite go-to spot for drinks and sports.  Had one REALLY bad experience with a former manager named Shawn LaDeux. Stacy was all over it and fixed the issue. Shawn is no longer at this location . Lindsay and Javier are by far the best waiters at this location. Both LOVE conversation, engage in all topics and give a very welcoming vibe. Remembers orders. VERY friendly.  I DEFINITEY recommends the ""Blue Pacific"". This is an older drink that is longer on the menu. Only old timers know about it ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside
Emily R.,"Sacramento, CA",103,67,4,5.0,9/4/2017,We went to Legoland and decided to have dinner at Chili's. It was a busy. Saturday night! The hostess was very nice! Told us it was about 25mins wait. She saw how tired and hungry the kids were and she got us sat in 10 mins  Our server Brandan was so sweet! Very pleased to talk too! He got our food and drinks out fast!

Erich C.,"Oceanside, CA",542,487,1437,3.0,8/6/2017,"It's a chain.  I typically don't like eating at chains because they are so formulaic.  Still, when I discovered Chili's had happy hour all day long on Sundays - I thought why not? Of course, we learned it was only in the bar area...drat!  (we had our kids with us) We got a booth and each of us ordered.  My wife and I got the 2 for $22 deal with drinks (which came to $35).  Not a bad deal really.  The Presidente margaritas came in a shaker and had the small margarita glass I have ever seen!   The fajitas were just okay.  The onions and peppers were not grilled enough.  I like to see some char on my grilled foods.  We did order chips & salsa with guac as our appetizer and I have to admit they were pretty freakin' good.   My wife enjoyed her burger and the kids loved their pizza.  One daughter did not like the chicken mac & cheese, but I thought it tasted good. We'll be back on a Sunday and sit in the bar next time.  If we had that chance today I might have boosted them another star ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside

Mary R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/31/2017,"This is regarding the male bartender on duty 12-31-2017 @ 4:20pm. I went in to the bar area, which was unusually empty for New Years Eve afternoon....There were plenty of open seats at the bar and plenty of open tables at the bar area. So I sit down and wait, and wait and wait. Finally the female bartender, who is trying to leave from her shift, while the on-duty bar tender is standing there washing the same glass over and over staring at the big screen, she asks me i've been helped yet. I said no and she immediately asked what I wanted and served me. After that I decided to just have one drink and leave. Soon after that, two girl college students come in and his face lights up and he serves them immediately. Hmmm, hope he likes the $0 tip I gave him.

Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,826,2.0,5/8/2016,"God, this review has been sitting in my queue for over a year now.  Not sure why I just didn't delete the suggestion, though I do come here and even check-in on occasion.  I guess I really should get this out of the way. /sigh Alright, I typically lump Chili's in with all the other places in the chain restaurant category.  If you've been to one Island's (the Denny's of tacky burgers), you've been to them all.  If you've eaten at one Marie Calendar's (the Denny's of fake home cooking), you eaten at them all.  If you've subjected to yourself to one Rimel's (the Denny's of Denny's), you're probably lying in the ICU at the hospital with an inflamed bowel ravaged by dysentery.  Well, Chili's is the Tex-Mex version of Denny's, not quite Mex enough to be an El Torito and not quite Tex enough to violate minority rights. Harmless enough, any appetizers you find are likely pre-frozen and fried up, salads will come out of a mixed bag, and most of the spice will come from salt.  That's not to say the food is bad, it's just basic and unimaginative.  A lot of cheese, some bacon sprinkled on top, a side of fries, and some cream based dressing can make anything edible for a night.  And they serve beer, which is how they stay afloat along with happy hour, I'm sure. The employees are generally nice, though absent most of the time.  I think this stems from from the fact that there are mini-computers on each table that can take orders instead of a waiter of waitress that you have to pay.  We've had trips here where we see someone to make our initial order, someone else deliver, and then never see another soul unless we ask for a refill or the bill on that touch screen.  That's extremely lazy (or cheap) on Chili's part and a bit of a disservice to their customers. Still, as far as chain places go, it's generally more alright than disgusting.  There's nothing on the menu that you have to come back and try again, but there's rarely anything you won't push away either.  Again, coated with cheese and served with blue cheese, you'll probably not complain too much.  And if you stick with happy hour and maybe a dessert, you'll more than likely walk out with a smile and a light stomach ache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside
Jim H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,48,3,1.0,1/25/2017,"Absolutely terrible. Anyone that thinks chilli's represents good food or value for money needs to have a word with themselves.  Paying $14 for a grill chilled sandwich would be fine if it was the greatest chicken sandwich ever, made from the finest ingredients, and served with care and attention. But this wasn't any of those things. More accurately, I'd say this was cooked from frozen slop, served by staff that couldn't care less. You get better food at McDonald's- no joke. How is this a national chain??? Why do people go here??? This was my 2nd time ever at a chilli's and I will never be back for a 3rd.  Complete rubbish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside
Greg B.,"San Diego, CA",74,298,200,2.0,11/7/2015,"Not a great experience overall.  First of all, when walking in a few minutes before noon there wasn't anyone manning the front desk. I realize it's still kinda quiet but you've been open for an hour and you're about to get the lunch rush. Why is there no one up there? Even after we seated ourselves in the bar area (where everyone in the restaurant was dining at the time) we still had to flag someone down because no one was paying attention. What's worse is that this seems to be a common problem in a lot of reviews. Management, take note.  The food itself is just cheese, salt, and butter - and not in a good way either. The nacho appetizer was drenched in cheese and they weren't really nachos; they were more like...cheese chips. Not what you'd envision nachos as being. For the main course for some reason I felt inspired to order a ribeye steak. Speaking of which, when the hell did Chili's start cooking steaks? Either way, it was just okay. Seasoning was eh, the slab of butter I could have done without, and the temperature was rare. **Regarding the temperature: I usually order medium all the time but I've just about given up on restaurants being able to actually cook their steaks right. Usually if I order medium it comes to me well done, so I felt adventurous and ordered medium rare thinking they'll cook it up one temperature to a medium. The plan backfired as it came out rare. I don't really mind rare and this isn't as much of an issue as I'm making it out to be but I'm just sayin'. Anywho, moving on, the mashed potatoes were a disaster. Loaded with way too much butter and were topped with some kind of hard cheese shell thing? I don't even know how to describe the damn thing but it was weird. As someone who makes the greatest mashed potatoes in the world I struggled with these things. Good potatoes go beyond massive slabs of butter.  The other member of my party ordered a chicken bacon club sandwich thing that was topped with so much lettuce that even a vegan would complain about it. Check out the pic.  Also, this restaurant is located in a massive plaza with about 40 other restaurants. If you approach this one from the west you'll notice that there's no sign on the side of the building to indicate that, yes, this is indeed a Chili's. Kind of odd. Service was nice, though. But the food was really eh, the potatoes were ehhhhh, and not having anyone take note of customers walking in was like what? At the end of the day it's a chain and you get what you pay for. Next time I'll play it safe and get ribs or a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside
Heidi I.,"Oceanside, CA",373,515,1161,2.0,8/8/2015,"See my more detailed previous review.  The service is worse and worse here.  We went in last week on Monday, as we had a rough day and were not able to get it together to make dinner.  Not even kidding, our dog died that afternoon and we had to take him to the Vet for ""after care"" and it was a horrible day, so we needed to get out of the house and have dinner and relax.   We went to Chili's.  We walked in and sat at a bar table.  For 5 minutes.  No one acknowledged us.  We moved to the bar top, thinking with a captive bartender on the other side of the counter we'd have better luck.  We did not.  After sitting at the bar for 5 more minutes, we left and went to Applebee's  This Chili's has the WORST SERVICE anywhere.   They have a few good burgers.  But not good enough to outdo the damage done by the horrible service.  If someone just stopped and said ""I will be right with you, so sorry for the wait"" we would have probably waited.  It was not that busy in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside

Cat C.,"San Angelo, TX",6,12,6,2.0,10/30/2016,"The food was fine - about a 3/5 on the scale of my Chili's experiences. Greasy chips, but otherwise mediocre. Worth the 2 for $22 tag. Here's the kicker - we sat at the table closest to where the staff liked to congregate, at the end of the bar nearest to the kitchen doors. Needless to say we overheard enough to make us never come back, including 1) a concerned bartender tell his manager that one of his plastered patrons was about to get behind the wheel only to be told condescendingly to get back to work; 2) a male server making snide comments about a customer at the bar; and my favorite: 3) OUR SERVER gesturing towards us when someone noticing her increasingly sour attitude asked ""what's wrong?""

Jaime F.,"San Marcos, CA",5,186,3,3.0,12/5/2016,"Here are the positive points this this place: 1) Super important with kids - they have a Ziosk!  Well worth the buck you spend to have an adult conversation at dinner! 2) They served what we ordered, it came out timely, the food tastes like it should from Chili's.  Here is where they fall short: 1) Service 2) Service getting us an extra Ziosk. Shouldn't be that hard. Everyone else does it. But everyone seemed to forget that we asked for an extra one. Two kids = two Ziosks. Or one Ziosk = two unhappy parents.  3) When we get seated, we usually hope to get served drinks within the first half of our meal.  4) It normally takes a waiter to come over and great is to get our drinks.  Overall, we would return. We got our food in the end and had an extra cell phone with us for child #2.

As for what I ordered, a full order of their classic nachos which are pretty damn good, and a fajita plate which I don't recommend ordering Togo, not because of food quality or anything it's just that when you sit at the restaurant the fajita plate is presented on a sizzling flat iron plate and it's just a different experience.

Our server (Alexa) was by far the best server I've ever had in my 49 years of life, including 5 star Zagat restaurants. Not only did she apologize which was completely not necessary for a 5 minute wait to take our drink orders, she sent the manager to apologize to us for the delay, gave us a 10% discount on our meal, gave us free chips, dip and queso and free dessert. OH MY GOD. The food was fresh, delicious, consistent with other chili's locations but the HUGE difference here is the service was OVER THE TOP.

As an appetizer dish I would give it 3.5 stars.   Main course quesadilla explosion  Wife said 3 stars. It was big and the quesadillas were thick. Chicken was a little salty for her taste.  The salad was ""fresh enough"" and a full rack of ribs.  So I am a rib snob and really hard on ribs.  These ribs were ok. Probably 2.5 stars and won't do them again if your in the mood for ribs this ain't the place for you and unfortunately I was.  Will be more adventurous next time.   Service.

We had to ask a server to find our server. She apologized and we understood they were busy. Since we were seated in her section we witnessed two larger parties being pampered by our server and we were left in the dark.  When she came the first time she took our full order because we were left alone long enough to decide everything we wanted to order.  The food took 45 minutes for a house salad and a two and a half minute per side steak (medium rare). The steak was unevenly cooked. In one tiny section it was medium rare, the rest ranged from fully cooked to a hint of medium. We had to ask a different server from the two we talked to for utensils. We stared at our food for a good minute.  We were so hungry we didn't accept their change. The manager came by and politely took a section of our bill off.

As we were getting ready to leave my 9 year old grandson needed to use the restroom so I went with him and waited next to his stall. A few minutes passed and a man came out of the second stall wearing a red apron folded over at his waist as this was happening a second man wearing a Chilli's shirt entered the restroom, the first man gave him a head nod and walked out WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!!!  When the second man finished using the urinal as he was  washing his hands I asked him if the guy who had just left worked there and he said ""I didn't see anyone who works here"". I went out and asked to speak with a manager and a few minutes later a man who identified himself as Sean came up to me and I told him what I had just witnessed and he asked me if the guy was a caucasian man when I said yes, he said ""I think I know who it is"". How would he know who he is? Evidently this wasn't the first time this has happened.  He said he would go ask him if he had just used the bathroom.

Lindsey M.,"Vista, CA",205,252,321,4.0,5/21/2013,"On average, I find myself eating at this restaurant at least once a month. With summer approaching, I'll probably see me and my family in there 2 or 3 times a month and I'll explain why. Why do I return time and time again? The food's pretty tasty and the prices don't make my wallet ache.With this chain, I'm a creature of habit, I tend to always order the Big Mouth Bites, which I can share with my picky eater of a 2 year old. 4 sliders and a fair heap of fries and fried onion strips -don't forget the cup of ranch! The 2/$20 deal is super (in terms of amount of food and price) if you've got a buddy, honey, or date to go halves with you Shoot, you could just have an extreme appetite, the deal will satiate your hunger and not break the bank . Of course, Chilis being known for it's ribs, you'll want to check out that sweet portion of the menu! So the reason for my increased future visits is that Chili's offers Happy Hour. Sit in the bar during Happy Hour time(s) and enjoy cheap eats ($2.99-4.99) and drinks. The margaritas are delicious, especially the Tropical Sunrise and if you'd like to walk away a little wobbly, try El Niño margarita! During Happy Hour, I believe you'll only get a deal on the Tropical Sunrise and one other margarita, but hey, a drink's a drink and at a lowered price, you can't go wrong. In addition, Chili's-To-Go has never failed my family and they just now added Tablet/iPad menus to their tables which I think is pretty darn innovative. Order your desserts, look through specials, play games (well, for $0.99 a game...), pay your bill, and print your receipt! It says you can call your waitress/waiter from your table as well, but I was too apprehensive to try that feature.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=60

But having one server serve the WHOLE bar during happy hour is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Maybe someone called off, who knows, but she could have said that she would do the best she could and things might be a little slower, or at least grab someone from the dinning area to help out.  When we asked for the bill my friends and I all had our cards ready. She placed them down and we put our cards right on top, yet she didn't take them. She made us wait another ten minutes which makes no sense once again... That is one of my biggest dining pet peeves. I don't understand why she didn't take our checks. Whatever.

WYATT's PEPPER PALS LITTLE MOUTH CHEESEBURGER was overcooked, dry and mostly bun. JULIANA's PEPPER PALS CORN DOG was hot and greasy and fresh out of the fryer -- everything you could want or ever hope for in a corn dog. mom's BIG MOUTH BITES (four mini burgers topped with applewood smoked bacon, american cheese, sauteed onions and ranch dressing) were overcooked and the bacon was hard to find. love the crispy onion strings. SOUTHWESTERN EGGROLLS (crispy flour tortilla filled with smoked chicken, black beans, corn, jalapeño jack cheese, red peppers and spinach) were just ok. the avocado-ranch dressing was just ranch. should have followed what i suspect was TRIANA J's (see her review) very good advice and limited my visit to happy hour and desert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=100

Katie A.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/12/2015,"Today I took my son to Chili's for lunch.  All was well until it came time to leave and pay the bill.  I handed our server my credit card and ID (military).  It took some time, but eventually a different server returned with both with a message from Chili's manager:  Chili's would honor the military discount this time, but to please remember in the future that the discount was for active duty members only.   The encounter was very rude.  I was shocked.  I wasn't looking for a discount, simply trying to verify my identity.  I was insulted and felt anger. When shopping or dining, I show my military ID because I am proud of the service my husband does for our country (he is currently active duty, 12 years).  Then I thought about the spouses to the servicemen and women of our armed forces.  To say that they, we, don't serve is a slap in the face.  We choose not put down roots by moving every few years, are left behind when our loved ones deploy, are separated from our spouses for long periods time, and live with the hope that our husbands and wives return to us safely.   To the manager at Chili's that couldn't be bothered to look me in the eye to explain a policy for a discount that I didn't even ask for:  You're welcome that my family serves to protect you daily.  You can keep your food and your discounts, but you lose my patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=80

Shaun C.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",124,53,98,5.0,2/9/2013,"Went here tonight with a date and had a great experience. For me, Chili's is one of those neutral type of places where you know there will be plenty on the menu to choose from and there will be something decent for everyone. Tonight was no different. Both of us have somewhat special dietary requirements (he's on a serious clean eating/guten free/etc etc kick and I've had bariatric surgery), but we both were able to have our orders easily modified to accomodate us.  As expected for a Friday night, the place was super packed and there was a 25 min wait time. The parking sucked and I had to park quite a distance away from the restaurant. We had the pleasure of being served by an awesome waitress named Alyssa. She was bubbly, playful and patient with our many requests.  I had the grilled chicken salad and my date had the fajita trio. Despite the full restaurant, the food came fairly quickly and everything was amazingly good. Definitely hit the spot!

Robert H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",269,286,720,3.0,5/12/2014,"It's with sadness that I have to update my review. After having such great experiences with both Service and Food, it seems the new experience has worn off.  Christine is no longer there :( and since she has left we have not found a replacement server that has given us the level of high quality service as her. So much to the point as we only go here as a take out restaurant. What we dislike about the take out side is we are required to pay 79cents now for extra salsa with our chips and salsa... Have you seen the bag of chips they give you and the extremely small salsa container? It's not even a possibility to eat chips and salsa because you run out of salsa 15 chips in. What's even funnier is that if I were to sit down not only do I get unlimited salsa but I also get unlimited chips....  Recently we came in and decided let's sit not in the bar but the dining room. Our waitress was decent. She checked on us and made sure everyone around us was taken care of. The only fault this time was our chicken. Under cooked. They did make it right but by the time it came back out of course mine was practically finished.  Overall this place has moved to being middle of the run and average where average is becoming acceptable.. .... New City and New Chances. After having several disappointments with Chili's in other areas in Orange County & LA County we were reluctant to try another. But with our New City we figured lets give it a chance. When coming into the bar we were able to find seating at a table top. We first noticed the new kiosk tablet at the table. Immediately we started playing with it like little kids we are. Then our server came up to us introduced herself as Christine and was on point all night. She went over the easy to use tablet, which was so easy to reorder our drinks. Later on in the night the Manager Conrad came over pleasantly introduced himself and continued with the great customer service. Although this time around we hadn't ordered entrees only drinks, appetizers and dessert. Everything about this experience was worth coming back for the to try the food. It's people like Christine and Conrad that make coming to a new town an easy transition. Not to mention the entire staff that walked by or were in sight were extremely friendly.

We were actually going to the new Buffalo Wild Wings that opened next door, but the line was out the door and a 1 hour wait.  So we decided to go to Chilis.  Got seated right away.  That was the first indicator, the place was half empty on a Friday night at 7pm. The service was slow, and the food was average.  Nothing great to report.   The kicker was the ipad like device that was on the table.  Had the menu electronically, had games for the kids, etc...Not a bad touch but felt more like someone placing a flat panel tv in your grandma's house to make the house feel modern.  Just doesn't go. When I got the bill they charged me .99 for use of the tablet my 3 year old was playing with.  It's not the money, it's the principle....nickel and dime me for a value add at the table.

Lea O.,"Oceanside, CA",114,33,,1.0,5/20/2013,"I used to give Chili's three stars as the customer service was always good and friendly but the food was basic restaurant fare, nothing extraordinary. But the new tablet at the table and the service that goes along with it completely ruined our experience. Chili's now has two servers per a table. We saw one of our servers twice, didn't see the other one at all, someone else brought our drinks, and another person brought our food. When we were seated the hostess let us know about the new tablets and how they have games on them. She didn't tell us that we had to pay to use the games, if we had just handed this over to our daughter to play with she would have added that on to our bill. Thankfully we didn't, we realized immediately how they worked and put it at the end of the table and didn't play with it. But you're now expected to re-order your drinks and order appetizers and desserts from the new tablet because its apparently too much trouble for your servers to ask.  When our server came to our table she introduced herself and asked us our names. That's fine for my five year old but idiotic for us as adults... It sounded like she was attempting to make the experience more personable but truthfully we saw her twice so it just came off as fake and forced (not that our server wasn't trying). BUT THAT WASN'T HER FAULT. There were way too many hands in our customer service for her to make a connection. I couldn't even remember our server's name... which for me is a big deal, but we didn't see her enough for it to even matter. She gave us her name, asked for ours, and no one used either at any point during the meal. BLEH! When we were finished with our meal and went to pay our check (again on the tablet), it had turned out that the wrong one was on our table and instead of a $30 bill, we had a $90 bill. It took over 10 minutes to get this fixed as the other table had already paid our bill. We were already so put off by our experience that we just wanted to go.  I live off tips, but with the lack of customer service we didn't feel our servers deserved the automatic 20% tip that the tablet forced on us and we did change it to 15% (which sucks because we normally leave a 40-60% tip but I couldn't do it with the crap for service we received). My husband and I normally go here a couple times a month as this Chili's is walking distance from our house and our servers have always been friendly and personable, after this I doubt we'll return. When the servers changed to two servers per a table the quality of service had already decreased but now the level of gimmick and lack of customer service is appalling. I'd rather have to drive somewhere further out than receive poor service for food that is standard restaurant fare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=140

My wife and I usually tend to stay away from these large chain restaurants when going out for a drink. Just like everyone else we like small hole in the wall places where everybody knows your name. Our First Visit:    We visited Chili's on a whim, because we hadn't tried it before so we stopped in for a bite to eat. Being the person I am I informed my wife the bar was the place to be, even though we planned on eating as well, so we had a seat. As we were walking up to the bar we were greeted with kindness by both of the bartenders. They asked for our names and introduced themselves as well, making us feel very welcome. While we settled in and exchanged small talk they also managed to let us know the current featured drinks and happy hour specials, informatively though not pushing them upon us. My wife tried one of their Margaritas with a Corona in it and loved it, I personally had a Fat Tire on tap, which always hits the spot. The food was great as well, it isn't the most amazing food in the world, this is not a gourmet restaurant but it is more than pleasing for a chain. I had the honey chipolte  chicken crispers which were delicious and I get them quite a bit there. My wife enjoyed a Casear salad, minus the chicken. She now often gets a side of broccoli as well.  Later:    We still constantly visit Chili's as our local bar, we enjoy spending time there and meeting new people.  Thank you to all the wonderful bartenders, if you read this you know who you are.

Figured we'd give this old one a try.  They have a special right now where you get 1 app, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert for $20. It's a really good deal and no we didn't get it. I wasn't hungry enough for all that and the sandwich I wanted wasn't on the menu. I got the Grilled Fajita Pita with Chicken + ranch.  They put way too much stuff in that little pita. But the pita itself was pretty good. I took half the lettuce, bell peppers and onions out of it.  We got the blackberry and mango iced teas. The first round was way too sweet. The pump flavored syrup into their regular iced tea and our waitress was still getting the hang of exactly how many pumps were required for a decent drink. She was really nice though. I told her my tea was REALLY sweet and the next round was perfect. Both my pita and my Dads burger came with fries that were really really oversalted. I think the oversalted fries and sweet tea balanced each other out.  Next time I would get the Chicken Sandwich on a wheat bun. I opted for the pita in light of the ranch and once I was done removing all the stuff I wouldn't eat there really wasn't any sauce left.

That's him in red trying to dodge their gestures of hate and violence towards each other as he's stuck in the crossfire).  Now, I know it's not the restaurants fault for the woopty-doos of their patrons, but it did sorta put us out because no girlfriend likes another girls scratches on their boyfriend (even if he was trying to calm the situation while being stuck in the doorway) and the police boxed his truck in while arresting them all keeping us stuck there for 30 minutes longer than we had hoped to stay. Normally this would be a situation in which the manger would come up to us at the to-go stand and comp the salad or steak for the physical inconvience of being assaulted but he didn't. We never saw him/her. The staff working there was nice and we all shared some ""woo-dude"" stories, but no dinner comp. My boyfriend even asked.

I left with my husband following me out as I burst into tears in the parking lot! When we arrived. As soon as we walked in we noticed a full restaurant and a 2 year old child standing ON a bar chair AT THE BAR--Where no one under 18 is allowed to sit. After waiting about 20 minutes a young host/ busser finally greeted and seated us and I asked him why the family was being allowed to sit at the bar with their child sitting on the seat. He said he would forward the complaint the manager and he sat us at my request ""Far away from that uncomfortable situation."" After we ordered our food and it came wrong. The manager walked over and apologized for the mistakes on my order. I told him that the mistakes on the food was fine but why has he not done anything about the law being broken at the bar. He replied by saying first that I was wrong and that it did not happen. Then he changed his story and said he watched them and she never put her baby down. After telling him that I had complained when I came in and taken a picture as well he changed his tune. Then he claimed ignorance to the law - stating ""I'm not from here"" -I didn't know a minor couldn't stand at the bar top. Then, he said he talked to them and they said "" We're not hurting or bothering anyone."" ( EXCEPT THAT- IT IS ILLEGAL!) Because I'm sure all the people at the bar appreciated drinking alcohol in the presence of an infant- an infant not being watched and about to fall off a bar stool.Then he asked me to explain to him what I would do.( LIKE THAT MATTERS !BECAUSE I WORK THERE RIGHT?? ) He then said he talked to his general manager and the General Manager did not care. This is where he left it. THAT THE GENERAL MANAGER IGNORES THE LAW. He had argued with me about this and wouldn't leave our table. My husband had to ask him to leave. When I went back to my food it was cold after having this stupid conversation. So now my food was wrong and cold. He heard me complaining loudly about my food being cold and he came and comp'd the order.

His upbeat energy was definitely noticeable and b.c. of that, I could only compare to the remaining of my time there. Everything off their new menu was making my gf and I a long time to make a decision, but we were definitely hungry! Finally, we made a tough decision and ordered the pork carnitas and shrimp  fajitas, and the turkey avocado burger. When we got our order, they screwed it up and gave me chicken instead of my carnitas but Julio was quick to see the mistake and I got to keep the extra:) everything tasted great! The only thing I would complain about was not being able to scarf it all down that moment...but who doesn't like left overs!?!

Sanaja J.,"Oceanside, CA",13,1,,1.0,12/21/2016,"Came here tonight with my daughters and I would have to     say that this is the worst service we had at chilis. First was margaritas we got the 2 for $35 and we ordered virgin margaritas and they didn't give us the shakers.  They put them in a regular glass and didn't give us the shakers. When confronted about it we were told that chilis changed their glasses. Although we new that wasn't true because we have had a previous visit and the cups were the same. Then our appetizers came and that was fine. Dinner came and I was cutting my daughters steak up and as she ate a long hard white (object) looked like an worm but it didn't move. You couldn't cut it with a knife. When we confronted the waiter Brittany and Shawn (the manager) they stated that it was just fat. The skillet mash potatoes came on a plate and not a skillet. Finally we got dessert, we got the salted caramel molten and instead of putting that salted caramel they put cinnamon and sugar. When I confronted the waiter Brittany she argued that that's how it came. I pointed to the picture and explained that we had it before. She still tried to argue with me and I told her that no that's not how it comes. She then admitted that the chefs didn't prep the salted caramel for the topping. I asked her if she could go  and get the correct topping. We cut into the molten and we found out that the molten wasn't hot enough for the caramel to flow out.

Attentive: Check  Quick and timely: check From the first bite of the meal to the obligatory final offer for dessert, She was beyond impressive.  Some servers are not used to working with kids, and she had that in spades.  Instead of staggering the water with the chocolate milk (my kid is a drink-it-all-now-as-soon-as-I-get-it kid)  She brought he water and milk out at the same time.  in all my years of trying to figure out how to slow this process, the water threw off my daughter.  It was the first time that food service was able to change our dining experience in a positive manner, just by the rhythm of the items coming out.  It sounds stupid.  But it made a big deal when she had chocolate milk left over, and wasn't asking for either another one to be ordered, or some of whatever I was drinking.  Anyways. Then the cheese ball incident.  Somehow, the wings I ordered got the wrong sauce on them.  It happens.  This was remedied immediately, (see what I am saying? Crazy), with the plate returning with the correct items in under 90 seconds.  Damn.  You go girl.  In the kerfuffle of getting new food out, at some point out of my view, a frozen - uncooked, YES - cheeze buddy (cheese bites?) (not sure what they are called),  made its way into one of the dipping sauces.  just under the surface.  This plus wrong sauce, would have been game over.  But Again, IMMEDIATELY offered to remedy.  My reaction:  I ate it, therefore, it was on me.  Nothing left to fix.  She offered to replace, to comp, etc....her on the spot 'let me fix this NOW"" was so refreshing.  I remember when service USED to feel like this, and not in just the super fancy, ritzy places.  She is a dying breed of server:  ONE WHO TAKES PRIDE IN HER WORK.   Not sure where to go from here.  I think my bar just got re-set for every day dining service, and I am pretty sure that the rest of them are just waiting out there, ready to remind me she is a needle in a very large, food filled haystack.  Again Great Job, Alexa.   - RTJ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=40

We walked in and there was no hosts at the door so we just kind of stood there awkwardly for 4 or 5 minutes until someone finally came up and took us to a booth right next to a HUGE party of at least 20 people, it was so loud that I couldn't even hear the hostess tell us the specials. As the hostess walked away I noticed her cell phone sticking halfway out of her back pocket, which I find extremely unprofessional. The server came up, seemed a little uncomfortable, not sure if she was a new server or what, anyway she got our drink orders and our food orders. I got chicken strips and my boyfriend got pasta. My chicken was cold and tasted almost doughy and mushy. My boyfriend, however, really liked his pasta. My server refilled my Dr. Pepper and when she set it down, the cup was soaking wet, hot, and my drink had no ice in it, so my Dr. Pepper was warm. I ended up not eating my food or touching my drink again. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal though, that's the only reason I gave more than one star. And then just as an added bonus, as we were walking out, the hostess that sat us was standing at the front playing on her phone while she was supposed to be working, I told her to have a nice night and she looked startled because she hadn't noticed us walk up and she said ""yeah you too"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=160

Lauren B.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",1,9,,1.0,3/5/2010,"I ALWAYS use to push to go to Chili's as I am a sucker for their a) salsa, and b) chicken club tacos.  This last time will be my last time 1)took FOR-EVER to get a waiter to get our drink order (I have 2 toddlers...had I known it was going to take over 15 min for drinks I would have just brought them some!) 2) I *heart* their salsa, but I had to take the time to brush the LOADS of salt off of each chip before I could eat them....so a little of the magic is gone. 3) I ordered the chicken club tacos (which come with mexican rice and black beans), and there were no beans. When I mentioned this I was told that those were ""extra"". 4) The tacos had none of the mexi-ranch sauce (typically it does and they include a side container of it), the waitress seemed annoyed that I kept asking for things. 5) When I finally started to eat them I realized that not only were they cold, the chicken was so overcooked that it couldn't be chewed.   Now normally this would just irk me with the kitchen and not the waitstaff (it's not their fault right?), but when I pointed it out to her, her expression was one of "" So? what do you want ME to do?"" She did finally offer to take it back to the kitchen but by this point my husband and children were finished and ready to go.  (Shame we had to leave CHILI'S and get mom something to eat at the nearby Burger King :( When I asked to speak to a manager she said she would get one.....15-20 min later nothing.  VERY disappointed, as I am usually the one in my family pulling to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=160

Zenia P.,"San Diego, CA",230,279,144,3.0,4/28/2014,"Met up with a group of female friends for happy hour. It happened to be a busy evening, especially on a Tuesday night. Not sure why it was so busy, maybe due to Spring Break. There were seven in our group, including myself. As we waited at the bar area for our table, a couple of tables at the bar cleared up. We asked if we can just stay in the bar area instead of their dining area. We were able to transfer from the small booth to a couple of tables put together. Our server was nice and friendly, also a little overwhelmed. I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat and I didn't really want to drink, since I had to drive home, which was approx 40-45 min. Southeast of Oceanside. As my friends ordered their food and drinks, our server got caught up with their jokes and antics, she forgot to take my food order. As everybody else got their food, I was still waiting for our server to return. She finally took my order and apologized for forgetting. I know I was one of the quiet ones in our group. I usually am quiet when it comes new friends that I'm still trying to get to know. I ended up ordering the Triple Dipper appetizer. I got the Big Mouth Bites, Boneless Honey-Chipotle Wings and Southwestern Eggrolls. The Southwestern Eggrolls are my favorite! Since I didn't have any alcohol, I ordered a Mango Iced Tea. While my friends were downing their margaritas after they finished eating, I was still finishing up my food. As we received our somewhat separate checks, our server managed to mix up the checks. She had to correct a few of them. Overall, it was a fun evening spent with great company.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=160

Vicky M.,"Vista, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/19/2011,Service is always hit or miss at the Vista Way location in Vista. Half the staff always seems cranky and rude which makes for bad service. I tend to request certain people if I see them working because I know they always give great service. The food here is also hit or miss unfortunately. I usually stick with the chicken fajitas because 99% of the time they come out great. Everything else I have ordered here is always 50/50 on quality and taste. I have had issues sending food back because it was just unedible. Again depending on the service though this either goes smoothly or is a train wreck. The bad servers are always like really your sending it back are you sure you can't just eat it. Which is upsetting. Because of the service and food at this location being so hit or miss all the time a went from going here once a week to maybe once every two months or so now. Usually the only reason I go to this location now is because it's late and I had a long day don't want to cook and it's close by. I prefer the location in Oceanside.

Dick W.,"Encinitas, CA",0,20,3,4.0,5/6/2013,"I ate here with my gf last night and the service was a bit slow, the food was just good, but it's something else that made me appreciate this restaurant and it's staff. I had gone to the restroom before the food came and when I came back I took 2 rings off my hand so I could get my hands completely dry after washing them. I must've set the rings on the table and forgotten them once we paid and left because when I woke up this morning I realized they were gone and couldn't find them anywhere around my house. After work today I decided to stop by Chili's just hoping that someone had found them and put them aside safely in a lost and found. I really didn't think I was going to get them back, figured a busboy had just pocketed them when he found them or something, but to my surprise the hostess at the front desk came out from the back of the restaurant with both my rings in her hand and a smile on her face. I seriously couldn't believe it. Someone could've easily come up on over $300 in nice jewelery but instead whoever it was that found that was honest and turned them into a manager who placed them in the lost and found area. So despite the mediocre food and service, at least their staff has integrity and can be trusted with their patrons personal items. I'm going to chalk up the slow service and room temperature food to a bad night in the kitchen this time and I'll definitely be coming back to give them another shot based on their honesty alone.

Chili's is one of those restaurants that I find to be the definition of mediocre. They're barely good and I only wind up at one when cheap meals are needed. (say for someone's birthday). Our table was TERRIBLE. Half of it was taken up by two ketchup bottles (one was basically empty), the ""specials"" paper display, and a light that jutted out from the wall at shoulder level to illuminate our plates. We were packed in so tight to the other tables that when someone bent over to buss the one next to us if he had backed up even a step his butt would have been on my plate. I could hear everything that was happening at the tables around us so we had absolutely no privacy. I seriously could have reached over and grabbed food off of someone's plate without ever getting out of my seat. As for the food, it was okay. My sweet corn soup was better than expected and I'd definitely order it again. My boyfriends hamburger was nothing to write home about.

Megan G.,"Murrells Inlet, SC",11,8,1,2.0,7/17/2012,"5 adults + one baby going to get some happy hour and have a good family dinner. we go to the bar because they said that was only only place to get HH prices... not one team member came up to us to help accommodate us into fitting into a table or booth (they didn't ask to push tables together or pull up chairs) when the server/bartender came up to see us trying to squeeze into a booth (because that's what we preferred) she was making facial gestures like ""any day now"" when we told her that we wanted to get the HH prices but couldn't have us all fit comfortable she went somewhere to see if that can be accommodated in the restaurant area- she came back and said they would allow it, just tell them DARBY said okay (not sure if that was her or a manager) she then escorted us to the hostess stand and told the hostess to tell our new server (Mischa) that DARBY said it was okay. They brought us to a large enough table and we waited about 5 minutes (in my years for f&b, that is considered a long time) she was a sweet girl, but seemed either new, didn't know anything about the menu or very timid. We showed her what drinks we wanted from the HH menu and she explained to us that it was only valid in the bar- WELL last time I checked the hostess was suppose to tell you that DARBY said it was OKAY - so we explained that to her and she said fine, (since no one else thought it was a good idea to let her know) When we asked what the HH prices and drinks that were included she had no idea, and instead of telling us she will quickly check, she stood there telling us she didn't know. That right there is WRONG- my sister-in-law had to get up, and walk to the bar herself to figure out what the HH deal was, as the server stood with us getting a round of waters. my SIL came back and told the SERVER and us what the specials were and the server seemed pretty dumb founded. it took her no less than 10 minutes to bring us a round of waters, 5minutes after that came my rum & coke and a dr pepper. She came back about 5 minutes later to get our dinner order- we all got the 2for 20 with extra appetizers- she didn't ask the appropriate questions (burger temp, or type of sauce on my SIL's ribs). it took over 25minutes to get our apps- I had to flag down a hostess to check on it, then they came out 1minute after. we repeatedly asked her for extra napkins and dipping sauce- when she came back with the ranch I had to ask her again for the napkins.. when we were barely half way through the apps our dinner arrived.. obviously we were extremely upset because we had no time to eat, relax and enjoy our apps because of how late they came out. THE APPS WERE OVER COOKED AND LUKE WARM-the cheese was hard on the fries probably because they were dying in the window. when my sister got her ribs she asked if those were the right sauce, because the girl didn't even ask- so she must of assumed- the server apologized and hesitated a bit to remove the plate from her, luckily the burger was a good temp. sis explained she was upset about the time it took for our apps and the server apologized. The manager came over to tell her he was sorry about the timing and that he will wait for the ribs if she wants to finish her app-  ugh HELLO?! the whole table was pissed about the timing, just because she is the only one who said something for ALL of us doesn't mean we all wanted to have our dinner sitting in our face getting cold bc we were trying to eat our apps - she said no, because the rest of my family has their dinner. he then walked away and the ribs came out. After that the server became more attentive and I did feel bad for her because I know how demanding it can be in that industry, but if you can't handle it or know your stuff you need to train/study more or find a different field. when the check arrive she did not give me the HH pricing for my drinks, so she had to fix that, nor was anything comped for the poor service and timing we received. We were so beyond agitated because we wanted a nice family dinner that we did not feel like complaining anymore.

Zoe B.,"Oceanside, CA",29,49,6,4.0,12/7/2010,"Some of the reviews here baffle me. They talk about an overall decent experience, yet give only two stars. Harsh! I hope they don't treat their kids the same way.  My partner and I are regulars here and we often go for dinner after work, about once a week. For the absolute best service, sit in the bar area. The servers there are dynamite! Fast, friendly, efficient, responsive, explosive... just kidding about that last one. :-) The rest is true though, they truly work towards making sure your experience is a positive one. The other part of the dining area... well, I'll get to that later. Overall their menu consists of fairly flavorful food. The fried shrimp is as close to perfect as I've ever found: lightly battered, full of flavor, and perfectly cooked. I can't tell you how many time I've been disappointed by fried shrimp in other places. The batter is too thick, the shrimp is too salty, or they overcook it. Here it's good almost every time. I don't usually eat red meat, but I'll sometimes make an exception for their babyback ribs. Both the original and the Shiner Bock sauces are good. The Monterey Chicken is another flavorful favorite. Some of the items, such as the Margarita Chicken, leave something to be desired with dry chicken. That particular item is healthier fare though, with no gravy or cheese to tone down the dryness of the chicken breast. When you go as many times as I have, you learn what to consistently order and what to avoid. Still, if it's still on the menu, then there must be those who like it, right? For margarita lovers, it's hard to beat El Presidente! Just the right amount of tartness, sweetness and kick. Other places may make decent margaritas, but these remain an absolute favorite. I love dessert, but most of the desserts here I find to be way too sweet. Sugar overload, especially with either of the lava cakes. While I have mostly positive things to say about this Chili's, there are a few things that cause me to remove a star from a potential 5-star rating. Before we learned to sit in the bar, we would sit in the regular dining area. One of the Happy Hour specials is $5 margaritas. Well if you sit in the regular dining area, you won't get happy hour prices. Occasionally a server will honor the happy hour price, but usually they'll just tell you those prices are only available in the bar. Is that ridiculous or what? So I would tell the server forget it, haul myself over to the bar, get the margarita, and then go back to my seat. Seriously, what is the big deal where we sit? Happy hour prices should be everywhere! The full menu is available in the bar, so what's the difference? Another area of disappointment is inconsistency. First the inconsistency of service regarding the dining area drink prices. Second is sometimes the margarita is off - either it's too watered down, or it's not filled to the top of the shaker. They seem to have improved that in the last few weeks, so maybe they got rid of the bad bartender. Or maybe they make better ones because we sit in the bar now. Who knows. It's true there tend to be hoards of screaming children around every time we go, but it's one of the downfalls of going to a family friendly place. It's noticeably better in the bar area, for obvious reasons (though they don't ban kids from sitting there if they're with parents). Yet another reason to sit in the bar during happy hour!  The noise levels are average for a busy restaurant. A bit loud, depending on who your table neighbors are, but you should be able to hear your table-mates' conversations. Overall a great place to go with friends or family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=180
Sera S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,16,,4.0,6/6/2012,"I really enjoy going to this Chilis. I always receive good service and the food is always good. The parking can get kind of annoying due to all stores and other restaurants in the vicinity. I order takeout online a lot so I highly recommend it as they always get my order correct. Happy hour has some great deals, I recommend trying the margaritas, they're my favorite. My only complaint is when I get sat by customers with noisy children (which sadly has been 75% of the time)... You know the rest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=180
Lacey G.,"Oceanside, CA",1,18,,4.0,2/22/2012,I have gone here on quite a few date nights with my husband as well as gone for other times for lunches and dinner and I do enjoy the food. The noise level is nicer at lunch time thn dinner because a lot more people go in for dinner so it gets pretty noisy.  But the service has always been great and the food is quite good so I will continue to go here once in a while.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=180
Juan R.,"Oceanside, CA",0,21,,1.0,10/26/2014,"it is hit or miss... and tonite it was definitely a miss.Mediocre food, bad service and a long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=180
L R.,"Oceanside, CA",50,95,10,2.0,9/26/2010,"It's Chili's what do you expect? I go mostly for their Happy Hour as you get free chips and salsa and their drinks are pretty decently priced. Our server was awesome and on top of his game the past few times we have sat in the bar, but lets be  honest this place does not have the best food (especially since they took away one of my favorite salads) nor do they have an awesome selection of micro beers. Nonetheless its decent for a happy hour and even then you can find a better place if you feel like researching happy hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=180
Cata M.,"Vista, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/28/2011,"Chili's used to be good, but the past couple of years it has really gone downhill.  Service is pretty awful.  Food is usually cold and not prepared right.  Not sure what's changed but it's just not the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=180
