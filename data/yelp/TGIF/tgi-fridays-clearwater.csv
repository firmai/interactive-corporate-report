Ryan T.,"Wildwood, FL",7,37,6,3.0,4/4/2012,"Although it's now closed, I stil wanted to write a quick review.  I liked this Friday's and it's a shame that it closed down.  I'm in the Clearwater area fairly often, and it was a good hang-out joint for me and friends.  Food and service were always just fine; drinks were typical Friday's fare: weak, weak, weak.  But the Friday's Stripes Rewards program is very good, and that's why I keep going back to TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clearwater
John L.,"Tampa, FL",1,28,1,1.0,4/29/2010,"I used to not think too much of Friday's.  I could take it or leave it.  Now, I will definitely leave it.  Let me describe our last experience... This particular Fridays is close to my house so I invited some friends that were visiting from out of town out for a quick bite with myself and my girlfriend.  We arrived and were finally seated after the server noticed we were there about 5 minutes later.  We first ordered a few beers and and appetizers.  The beers arrived warm...the appetizer was MIA.  We reminded our server of this when the entrees came and he offered to bring it now but we declined because we already had our meals.  Which were half cold and fairly disgusting.   Now I'm not one to complain at a restaurant usually, it's just not my style, but this time we just had to.  The manager offered us coupons for a free appetizer on our next visit and we left them in our plates because we said we would never come back so there would be no chance to use them. This was about 2 years ago shortly after they remodeled this Fridays and I haven't been back since.  Go to the Chilis next door, it's a much better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clearwater

Stephanie N.,"Clearwater, FL",376,632,20,3.0,8/29/2006,"Its strange that this is located right next to a Chili's.  Its a l'il harder to access, so by default I think Chili's gets more business. lol.  anyways, this place is like any othe Friday's location w/ the Jack Daniel flavored beef and chicken dishes.  Americana decor galore.  In my opinion, its overpriced, but you can come fo r the huge drinks as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clearwater
