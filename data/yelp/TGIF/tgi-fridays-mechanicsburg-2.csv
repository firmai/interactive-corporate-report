Megan W.,"New Cumberland, PA",0,1,,3.0,6/11/2014,Food = excellent Drink prices = INSANE I've never paid more than $8.50 for sangria ever in my life. They charge $11.50 here. There may be 3 kinds of alcohol but there are also 5-6 nonalcoholic ingredients.  And the size of the drink is not measurable to any drink you'd pay $11.50 for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Lauren K.,"Carlisle, PA",2,20,8,5.0,10/5/2014,"We ate there today at 2pm (restaurant downtime) and had a party of 20 with 12 adults and 8 children. All of the adults had the unlimited appetizers, and Laura was a phenomenal waitress! Every single drink was filled multiple times, we all ate tons of appetizers, and overall had an awesome experience. The general manager Russel introduced himself before the entire party arrived and was genuinely warm and personable. He even helped deliver some of our food! Great job to the kitchen keeping up with all of us...we made an incredible memory today! Brava!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Kay F.,"Harrisburg, PA",4,33,,5.0,12/16/2014,"WE love this TGI FRIDAYS  (we live in North Harrisburg & the Union Deposit one is disgusting! & Never honored our Stripes!)  We sit at the bar & they have the same  ""GREAT""  bartenders with fantastic service! Our food is always good & never rushed ...& ALWAYS receive our free chips & salsa!  Lots of TV's  to watch for sports. To:  John G. regarding price of Wine~~  you are in PA!!!  These people PAY A LOT FOR THE ""PA"" LIQUOR/WINE  license!!!!  Go to Florida & get the same thing for $3.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Kimberly S.,"Dover, PA",65,12,,1.0,8/2/2015,"After sitting down our server came over fairly quickly to get our drink order, but that was about the only thing she got right. We sat without drinks for almost 15 minutes. Meanwhile our margarita's were finished and sitting at the bar. The manager stopped to make sure we'd been taken care of, I replied that we had but had been waiting a long time for our drinks. He said he thought they were ready, but he would go check. Instead of bringing them to us, he had our server do it which took even more time. After she came over with the drinks I tried to order an appetizer and she walked away from the table mid order!!! I had to flag her down to place the order. While ordering our food it became apparent she had little to no menu knowledge even though she said she'd worked there for a year. My friend requested a sauce used in another menu item and the girl said they didn't have it, but they really do. When the food arrived my friends salad was missing avocado. When asked for it the server replied that salad doesn't come with avocado but I can get it for you at an extra charge. The menu clearly stated the salad had avocado. At this point our table was not cleared of empty plates and glasses causing us to feel cramped, so we stacked them and put them to the edge of the table. They still sat there every time she walked past. Her attitude was horrible and it was obvious she didn't care we weren't happy. Not a good experience at all! Only positive of this visit was  the bartenders participating in bar champs. Ricky (sp?) noticed my drink wasn't properly made and even though I told her it was fine, fixed it because that's what you're supposed to do! The guest should be the top priority, and within reason do whatever it takes to make them happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
PitBull D.,"Hedgesville, WV",58,476,262,4.0,6/19/2011,"Haven't been to TGIF for about a year because we moved and there are none nearby our new residence. Since my last visit, they have introduced a ""new"" menu. What this means is that they dropped losers and added a few new entrees. They also increased menu prices across-the-board ~20%. That was a bit of a surprize to me. The Cobb Salad was excellent in freshness and presentation. It was so nice I wish I had my camera to take a picture for posting. The bacon was strips, not bacon crumbles. Real avocado slices, etc.  Wife had the three-way sampler, with Buffalo WIngs, fried green beans, and fried mozzarella sticks. The first two were as expected. The fried mozzarella sticks were good, but clearly frozen and fried...probably from a central warehouse, for consistency with size and breading. Unremarkable.  Overall, I prefer local establishments (mom and pops) but we were traveling through and didn't want to go hunting. This was convenient to the highway exit and so I do chains on occasion and order what I have learned are the better menu choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Amy G.,"Hampden, PA",122,387,25,4.0,10/21/2008,"I usually find chain restaurants to be less than thrilling.  I'm actually thrilled with this TGI Friday's.  I can't believe I just said that. Granted, it's still pretty new, but the ambiance is sleek yet comfortable and interesting.  The service has always been amazing.  Shocking for one of these middle-tier chain restaurants that usually is a little lack lustre. Yes, the server paging electronic thing-a-ma-jig is pretty cool.  However, we rarely use it because the service is good. The drinks are overprices for what you get - but that seems to be the case just about everywhere these days. The food is good, the portions are fair (not grossly oversized), and the prices are reasonable for this class of restaurant.  Some of the food is great, some is good, some is ""meh"", and I once had a Southwest Mac & Cheese pasta dish that was overheated and dried out. Ugh.  I will never order it again. The Parmaesan-Crusted Sicilian Quesadillas appetizer is my favorite item on the menu.  It is soooo good we all end up using our fingers to get every last little bit of the balsamic glaze.    The Peruvian Roasted Chicken gets two thumbs up.  Nice and tasty with a decent kick.  The kids adore the nice, large portion of mac and cheese.  I even like it and I'm not a huge mac and cheese person. We like that the kids eat free on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  Woo hoo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Michelle R.,"Nazareth, PA",9,245,148,4.0,4/15/2013,"I know I previously said I didn't feel the need to come to one again but I did....and eh, it was ok. There wasn't much to go wrong since I chose an appetizer for lunch and a soda.

Andi M.,"York, PA",2,65,1,2.0,6/27/2011,Steak was like shoe leather and I even made the comment twice that it was really bouncy. Music is way too loud for the small amount of people here on a Monday night. Server was very nice and came back often. Miller lite draft only $1.50 on Mondays which is awesome. Decent desserts. Terrible music.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20

Fritz C.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",0,55,,2.0,5/2/2009,"I would give it a three star but anytime we go and sit by the bar and its around 4 pm service sucks, The booth we got was not cleaned got ketchup all over the back of my pants no knowing it till I left and never touched the ketchup, Waitress seems to constantly get lost and forgot about my drink order because she couldn't keep her tounge out of the bartenders face. Watching the kids coming into work all look like they want to be elsewhere. I guess there happy face is just for the job interview. It does seem that service is a little better if they are under pressure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Kris V.,"Huntington, WV",2,11,2,5.0,8/10/2009,"Fantastic, simply fantastic! After a horrible, scaring experience of trying to eat at the Hooter's down the road we decided to cut out losses after an hour and a half of nothing good. The staff were extremely pleasant and attentive! Food was excellent! Ordered the Jack Daniel's Sirlion, it was the best steak I've had in a while. They salvaged our night!

Khalid S.,"Harrisburg, PA",50,308,27,4.0,11/24/2007,"Usually I'm not this excited about franchise food, but I absolutely loved the food/atmosphere/service here.

Chris H.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,96,,3.0,11/18/2008,"Used to go here often, to meet friend and to get a quick bite to eat. When they first open it was nice the first of many, but something different over in Mechanicsburg. Then the place filled up with young teen age unexperienced wait staff and it went all down hill. After their shift would end they would all hang out in the bar area and be rude. Plus to top it off Fridays the company started make all their menu items smaller, now I haven't been there in about 3 months but the manager that was there at the time was a great. Some day we'll try it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Jane R.,"Harrisburg, PA",4,25,,5.0,10/10/2008,"love that chicken popper sandwich.  It seems that TGIF has finally realized that people don't need packed in cheek to jowl.  Of course, it may be that I just like it better since the stuff on the walls is from youth ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Cara D.,"Lanexa, VA",0,8,,2.0,12/29/2008,"It's a standard Friday's, but when I ate there this past week, it was on the downward slope. My fried green beans seemed pulled from the fryer too early (more oily, less crispy) and the house salad was served with a few pieces of lettuce on top to cover the fact that the bottom of the salad bag was used to fill the majority of the bottom of the bowl with piddly little crap. When I pointed it out to the waitress, she said she'd get me another one, and after about five minutes I wondered how long it takes to make a salad and told her to just strike it from the bill. I normally wouldn't complain about this kind of thing either, but there was also crap in my water (looked like dirt or coffee grounds) so overall I'd say they were either pissed to be working around the Christmas holiday and were slacking because of it, or it's gone downhill altogether, because this is the first bad experience I've had at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2?start=20
Easy To P.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,7,1,5.0,12/8/2017,"EXCELLENT experience with waitress and great food on top of it! We had a somewhat large group (7 adults 1 child). Our waitress had all the answers to our questions, when we ordered drinks she told us some of them would be cheaper in different sizes due to happy hour, and was very accommodating to special requests.  After taking our order she came back and refilled waters and sodas before they were empty and was quick with getting plates out of the way.  The waitress was very attentive, friendly, and really made for a great night out. Job well done, TGI Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2
Derrick S.,"Camp Hill, PA",143,5,14,5.0,12/14/2017,Excellent service. Came here in Veterans Day and there wasn't a wait to be seated. Took awhile to get my drink but food came out right on time. I Dale to enjoy football and eat in piece.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2
Ivy A.,"Harrisburg, PA",15,18,1,5.0,12/29/2017,"After a dreadful first impression of the EastShore Friday's, we travelled across the river to try this location. Even though these locations are a few miles apart, they are truly worlds apart from one another. This location was well staffed, had no wait even though it was packed, and the wait staff crew worked as a unified team to make the guest experience memorable for all the right reasons.

Randall G.,"Harrisburg, PA",33,207,445,4.0,3/7/2017,"I like TGIF's as a chain restaurant even through its changes over the years ... This location is spacious and although small, the parking lot wraps around the building and I have yet to have trouble finding a space which is always a plus.   Seating again has never been a problem and we have never sat in the lobby waiting for a table.  TGIF is a chain so the menu is generally changing and available online. Burgers & fries, pasta, seafood, chicken and steak ... a little of this and that. They also have a nice appetizer menu and run specials on it.  A good place to stop when traveling with guests who prefer a generalized menu they are more familiar with.  Service here has always been slightly above average. Staff are polite and  have never had a problem having small alterations made to our entrees.  Drinks are overpriced but menu is fair. Coupons and promotions always have been received politely and why we tip on the full bill as you should ;-)  Warning: I love salt but I've noticed this location actually cooks with salt so taste your food prior to salting it or you might not enjoy.   Thanks for waiting on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2
Erica H.,"Marysville, PA",0,19,1,2.0,11/25/2017,"Went in last night around 10 PM. I ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta, half size, my boyfriend ordered a burger with endless sides and a long island iced tea. The drink was overly sour.  My pasta was cold and tasted like plastic. It was gross. I ate three bites and couldn't eat any more after that. In addition the endless appetizers we initially went there for that were originally $10 to begin with are now $15 and they took away numerous items from the choices. Yeah, no. This place is way overpriced for mediocre at best food. We won't be back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2

Carolyn R.,"Harrisburg, PA",73,75,313,4.0,2/11/2017,"The place that we went is the one in Carlisle pike. Pretty nice place and the people works there are nice too! We got a couple of kids meals and ahi tuna wrap that comes with salad with honey mustard dressing ( so good ). Also specialty burgers too, that comes with fries. They're all pretty good and taste fresh. Should try  the milk shake. They're really good.

Steven Z.,"Boiling Springs, PA",40,88,10,4.0,4/20/2017,For a chain restraint this place isn't bad the staff is usually extremely nice and helpful and the food is always enjoyable. I really enjoy that they re-tailored their endless apps program to make it a bit more flexible to try more then one type of appetizer. They also have had a 5 dollar Jameson special which is awesome for me because its my favorite liquor! Check this place out!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2
Anjali A.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",44,209,498,3.0,3/2/2015,"Excellent drink options. We ordered spicy margarita. It really was spicy, not only in name. We went little late on Saturday. The place was nor crowded, neither empty. Fast, no nonsense service. Entrée  was delicious - shrimp and chicken Alfredo pasta. Appetizer was just ok - Nachos. Ordered 3 desserts. Peanut butter pie - my niece loved it. Brownie - ok. Whiskey cake - good.  I would have given 4 stars, but took away 1 star because: 1) they gave us spoons with pasta. Where in the world do people eat pasta with spoons? 2) napkins and appetizer plates were brought to the table when we were nearly finished eating nachos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2

John G.,"Camp Hill, PA",80,246,109,3.0,10/9/2014,Are here with a group of about 20 people. We were set up as a party we had a couple of servers.  Had The chicken on Spinach great tasting dish enjoyed it. Seen a few of the other dish come out and everyone said their meals were good got to sample some Ahi tuna that was an appetizer got to say that it was enjoyable. Had a glass of Pinot Grigio seemed a bit expensive for the quality and quantity of the serving. Servers were slow and not as attentive for a group that was under reservations. Overall I enjoyed the evening but TGIFridays definitely has to improve on their servers even though their meals are really good! If the service was better probably would have rated a 4 star!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2
Kevin K.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,18,,2.0,1/21/2017,"I thought the meal was over priced. My wife had the salmon. She is a lite eater, Even she thought it was a small serving of salmon for the price. I always love the ribs at tgi fridays. However I got the jdaniels steak and ribs combo this time. Ribs were great as always. The steak was very poor quality. I ordered medium.... Of course it came out well done.  Tough & grizzly. In my opinion it was overpriced also. Service was good. Beware of the steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2
Allison H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",135,329,670,4.0,10/9/2015,"I would have rated 3 stars for the food, but the strong booze at a reasonable price, paired with good service  made the meal a lot better! I am not a fan of chains and only go to them when there is nothing else open (which happens frequently in Mechanicsburg)  In my opinion, the good was edible but meh. Everything is what one would expect from a chain. Generic. Still, I had a good experience and have had food of the same quality but for much higher prices anywhere else.

It has been 12-13 years since we had last eaten at a tgif. Now i know why we don't eat there any longer. We were seated within a reasonable amount of time and had both chosen the jack daniels chicken and shrimp meals along with a beer. The entree was just over $19 and well overpriced. But with a coupon, well, it was still overpriced. The sides we had chosen were fries, mac and cheese and something else that was forgettable. The fries were cheap shoestring that weren't even cooked that well and the mac and cheese looked ok, but had no flavor. But, to be fair, most mac and cheese you get anywhere isn't really good. You get 5-6 shrimp and a small piece of chicken. It tasted like frozen packaged stuff and really had no substance. The staff was nice, but man, $19 for a chicken and shrimp? you couldn't ever get me to eat there again if i was paying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mechanicsburg-2
