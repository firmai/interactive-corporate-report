9,Erin H.,"Englewood, CO",266,519,854.0,1.0,2013-01-30,"I am not a fan of Applebee's in general.  Really, the only time I eat at one is in Laurel because there is such a distinct lack of other restaurants.  There have been some trips where I've eaten here every night.  But, my advice is go somewhere else if you can.  Even one of the multitude of fast food joints on the same street.  Hey, I think there's a Sonic right next door.  Go there. The food was utterly forgettable.  I ordered the steak and shrimp off the low calorie menu.  There wasn't anything distinctly wrong with it, but it was an odd combination that lacked flavor and wasn't satisfying. The service was horrible.  I was alone on business, so asked for a table for 1.  Where do they put me?  Right next to the front door, next to the host/hostess stand where multiple employees congregated throughout my meal, and next to a table full of employees on a break or just leaving their shift.  With all the employees in the building you think my service would be fantastic, yet I was mostly ignored or bumped into.  My actual server was friendly enough, but it did not make up for the whole miserable experience. Trust me, McDonald's, Taco Bell, Sonic, anything will be better than this Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
13,Mike M.,"Memphis, TN",1,8,,1.0,2014-07-13,"This was quite possibly the worst dining (if one can call it that) experience of my life. The restaurant gives new lows to the serving and preparation of meals. We were staying across the street so it seemed easy - little did we know that our ""waitress"" after having ample time (long enough for all the beverages on the table to be dry) and with the assistance of most other waitresses on staff came back and proudly announced our order was in. We should have gone then but low blood sugar threw off our good judgement. When the food was placed on the table all three burgers were burnt beyond recognition and my wife's small steak and wedge salad well was so remarkable i actually took a picture. I have seen small chicken tenders larger than the steak - the onion slice was larger.  But then the color - while our burgers were burnt, the steak took on a raisanish quality. It was petrified, black, and lifeless on the plate. We found the spinach under the onion and it looked worse than a bagged salad sitting on the beach for a week.  Needless to say, we will not go back. Truly I wish i could put a warning label on the front sign.  This ""restaurant"" brings for me a whole new low to dining. The regrettable thing is that the people around us were expereincing problems equally except for one large table that knew the waitress - but their speedy service still only resulted in the most unappetizing of presentations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
10,James M.,"Houston, TX",0,13,,1.0,2014-11-18,"Went there for Dinner on Nov 7th with my dad and brother. Sat in the bar area and had a really cute short black waitress. She had a large area to cover but she had a really great attitude and service. I wish I remembered her name. We decided to go back on Sunday the 9th for dinner before heading back home the next day and it was horrible.  There was a young black man named Eric with long dreadlocks who was absolutely the rudest person you could have as a host and another black girl who kept pressing on her eyelashes to make sure they stayed on then touching the silver wear as they argued over who would seat the guest.   I actually had to offer to clean the table they were going to seat us at because the two host said it was not their job, and the girl handed me the rag to bus my own table. Julie was our waitress and she was incredible as the first young lady. We visit Laurel every year for Veterans Day and usually enjoy Applebee's and we were so disappointed by the two host on duty that evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
12,Meagan P.,"Laurel, MS",0,9,,4.0,2014-12-31,"Always ask for Nicky. She is a great waitress. I only ever order the two for twenty, with barbecue or mild boneless wings, and the oreintal chicken salad fried. Sometimes a different cook is in the back, and you get super small portions though, so be careful. Other then that, love this apple bees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
8,Lauren S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",208,11,,1.0,2015-07-12,"The worst Applebee's ever. The staff is constantly changing, which is probably why the service is so terrible. Food is not good. Service is terrible. The orders usually come out to the table incorrectly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
5,James T.,"Waynesboro, MS",18,113,585.0,4.0,2016-02-13,"Only giving 4stars , because I have had bad experiences here in the past , but damn if they didn't get it right this time.  Somebody has been making changes here , and it's for the best.  I would like to see Yuengling on draft , but hey it's new to Mississippi.

11,Gale J.,"Laurel, MS",0,1,,3.0,2016-04-02,I ate there on Easter Sunday  and ordered the fiesta lime chicken which is my usual favorite.  The rice was dry and there was hardly any sauce on the chicken.  It just wasn't as flavorful as it usually is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
6,Luranda R.,"Waynesboro, MS",0,17,13.0,5.0,2016-07-16,I'm impressed with the staff at Applebee's in Laurel Mississippi. The food was great and the server was there checking on us and making us feel right at home. I give 4 stars because whoever is running this place is doing an excellent job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
2,David R.,"Palestine, TX",14,229,881.0,4.0,2016-10-11,"I eat at all different places and have had all kinds of service. Today in Laurel, MS. , I ate lunch at Applebee's and Laurel was my waitress. I could tell from when I first was seated, that the waitress was having a tough day. Laurel came and took my drink order and told me they were shorthanded , and ask that , ""I be patient "". A little later , she took my order. I decided to try the Fiesta Lime Chicken with grilled veggies. It was great ! My meal was good, but I appreciated the attitude of Laurel , even though she was being run to death. When in Laurel, MS. , give them a try.

3,Amber Y.,"Saucier, MS",14,77,95.0,3.0,2017-05-17,"Applebee's is not my favorite but we did pop in here for lunch one Sunday. We ordered the sampler platter and drinks. The drinks are highly overpriced for what you get ( that should say ""or what you DON'T get"") Either way there was nothing special about this Applebee's. I don't plan on visiting again. It's just a personal preference for me. The service was fine. The food was hot. The restaurant wasn't dirty. I would recommend it if you're an Applebee's fan. I just think due to the prices of the drinks I'm not going back.  If I do find myself back there again I will NOT order an alcoholic drink. Where's the alcohol? Yes, found myself eating here again. I didn't order alcohol. I ordered a club sandwich and French onion soup. It was not anything special.  The bathroom was not very clean!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
1,Yasmin D.,"Torrance, CA",17,110,473.0,3.0,2017-06-08,"06.05.17 Day 2 in Laurel, MS. I was hoping I won't be eating at a restaurant chain but then again boyfriend's dad asked for Applebee's. Applebee's it is. I just love the southern greeting ""how y'all doin' tonight"" with a smile. When hostess and server starts that way, it's going to be a good meal for me, haha! We started off with their Chicken Quesadilla at half price being happy hour. Then boyfriend and I did the 2 for $20 meal wherein we got the Mozzarella sticks as (another) appetizer. Now the sticks came out first before the chicken quesadilla. Both were oily, tasted ok, and nothing special about it. Boyfriend had The American Standard (cheeseburger) and I had the Fried Chicken Tenders. Both came with fries. It was better than fair we think.  BF Dad had Shrimp Wanton Stir Fry which he enjoyed and said it was tasty.  We finished our meal with an order of Maple Walnut Blodie...now that's a signature Applebee's. This was really good. This experience was 3 stars. That's fair enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,

7,Brian H.,"Natchez, MS",0,3,,1.0,2017-07-11,"Applebee's is a name that I absolutely adored...until tonight. I never thought that the food was that great, but their love and admiration for America's brave Sons and Daughters always held a special place in my heart. My wife and I walked in and waited for fifteen minutes. In that fifteen minutes, several Applebee's employees, to include a manager, either walked past us several times or eerily stared at us. The worst part was that none of the employees even uttered a word to us. As we were walking back to our car, an employee by the name of Christina, who was working on the opposite side of the entrance, asked us to come back and she gave us 5 star service. We thought things were turning around, but we were wrong. One employee almost slammed a chair that she was returning to our table into my wife. Her extremely dangerous act was only topped by her apathetic attitude. She never apologized. Even though Christina's service was phenomenal, our overall experience was horrible. It was so bad that we decided to never step foot in ANY Applebee's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laurel-5,,,,,
