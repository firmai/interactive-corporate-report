Robert C.,"Somers, CT",5,14,4,3.0,1/5/2018,"This location is just like any other Red Robin, decent service, decent food. Red Robin is one of the only restaurants that seems to 100% consistent with quality.  The waitress we had was experienced and knew the menu will. I always appreciate someone who can take the order without writing it down and it actually comes out correctly. Food was exactly as I expected and drinks were always full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield
Abbe M.,"Stafford Springs, Stafford Springs, CT",0,4,1,3.0,9/3/2017,"If I based my review of this experience on my first few steps in the door, it would be a one star. I was ""greeted"" by 3 hostesses who, instead of openly welcoming me in, avoided eye contact, forcing me to eventually break a prolonged  silence.  The hostess who.ended up showing us our seats parked us at a booth in the cross roads of human traffic. Privacy= 1 star.  However, I must say they redeemed themselves when my drink came out. The water was excellent, garnished with two thick slices of juicy lemon.  We ordered and split a cheeseburger, which came out on two separate plates, nice touch. My half of the burger consisted of 4 juicy bites of succulent meat and a kick of BBQ. But I must say the onion bun that the burger came on tasted nothing like onions at all.  Waitress was kind, but a bit pushy.  Overall, an alright experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield
Ann E.,"Suffield, CT",32,383,248,4.0,4/12/2017,"Can't believe I haven't written a review for this Red Robin  I've been here more than a few times and have always come back. They do well with groups which is usually why I'm here. But tonight, I sat at the bar. Enjoyed a Lagunitas IPA and a Bacon Cheeseburger. Of course, the beer was delicious. The burger came out quick and hot-all fresh ingredients (meat, bun, lettuce, tomato.) I don't know if they make the bacon fresh, but it sure tasted like it. So, a good burger. I substituted Cole slaw for the fries-it had Dijon mustard in it. I'm not a fan of mustard, but this tasted pretty good. And, apparently the Cole slaw is bottomless. (As are many of the sides). The bartender Jess Mc was friendly and attentive. Of course, I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield
Renee R.,"New York, NY",969,117,502,4.0,7/16/2016,"3.5 with great service = 4 in my book. Bottomless French fries & sweet potato fries? Yes, please. Everyday of my life. And sauces galore?  I had the Cobb salad and I held the bacon, and it wasn't bad for a chain restaurant. The vegetables were OK, they definitely weren't picked out of someone's garden, but it was decent. Favorite: We had the donuts and they were definitely a five. I think that they were some kind of crough-nut (that trendy croissant & doughnut fusion) and they had some chocolate dipping sauce and some other raspberry sauce and it was really delicious. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I actually really enjoyed eating at this place. Kid friendly?  Check!  Great service?  Check! Outside seating?  Check!  Overall, good. Not the best, but they have great elements to a restaurant going for them.

Mary Ann H.,"Enfield, CT",17,8,,3.0,9/10/2017,I was here to support a local organization and have to say the hostesses greeted us when we came in and we were sat quickly. The wait staff were busy as the restaurant was crowded. The 3 stars are for the meals. I ordered The Wedgie burger and when I got my order it was missing the guacamole and our server was busy with other customers. I was able to flag down another server to bring me the guacomole. My friend ordered the salmon and the meal came out cold. The manager and staff were accommodating but hot food should be hot.  I have been a few times to Red Robin and have always enjoyed my meal but this time not so much.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield
Kris H.,"Central Manchester, CT",7,165,150,1.0,9/30/2017,"I do not like to give unfavorable reviews, especially when we really liked the server and the service was good.  But my husband and I cannot get over how bad the food was, and how we feel like we were robbed paying over $30 for such an unsatisfying meal.  We haven't been to any Red Robin in over a year, and had never been to this location, but we remembered the burgers and fries from previous meals and were looking forward to yummy burgers and the bottomless fries.  We decided to get the pretzels and beer cheese appetizer to split, then my hubby got the mushroom swiss burger and I did a regular burger with lettuce for a bun.  The ""beer cheese"" congealed as soon as it hit the pretzel, and had the taste and mouthfeel of Velveeta.  The pretzels were OK, but overall a disappointing app.  The best way I can describe the burgers was like eating pressed sawdust disks.  There was no flavor to the burger, and it had the texture of a thawed piece of who knows what slapped together with some veggies.  We were both starving so we ate the food, but regretted it later.  We had a toddler with us, she had pepperoni pizza with fries.  I would say the pizza was like frozen French bread pizza, but that would insult frozen French bread pizza.  There was no flavor in the bread, sauce or cheese, and the pepperoni was OK but pretty greasy.  There were about 10 fries total on her plate, and not at all how we remembered the fries at Red Robin.  In all honesty I used to plow thru the fries and get a second serving, this time I was done after 1 fry.  We had waters with our meal, so to spend $34 before tip on the meal felt like getting robbed.  We don't blame the server so we tipped her well, so $40 for what we were served guarantees we will not be returning.  Maybe their sales model is to used frozen, overly processed ""food"" to increase profit margin, I'm not sure, but we can't imagine shelling out good money for this when a drive thru burger beats this hands down (a statement I never thought I would make in this lifetime)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield
Tracy G.,"Agawam, MA",0,12,,1.0,12/12/2017,"We had a troubling experience at RR this time past Sunday. Got there around 2pm, were greeted and the server got menus ready to seat us. Another server cut in front of her, demanded our attention and began the whole check in process again with no explanation!  It was very confusing and seemed like the 1st server made a mistake, although no one tried to explain. This 2nd interloper spoke to us in an unsmiling, unapologetic and unappealing monotone, told us, 'It'll be a couple of minutes.' There was at least 1 table available in the bar area and no other parties of 2 that I could see (many other times, we were offered seats at the bar). After 10 minutes of waiting, we left.

Andy L.,"Enfield, CT",0,26,10,3.0,3/12/2017,"Busy Sunday afternoon, no problem sitting in the bar area. Rather noisy, which is to be expected in a restaurant that caters to families with kids, etc. Food came, A-1 Pepper corn burger with their famous ""bottomless"" fries. Fries were okay, the burger didn't have a lot of flavor curiously enough and was rather greasy (not a good greasy, but the sign of poor quality ground beef type greasy) and not very warm on top of everything else. The best part of my experience was the tall, ice cold Yuengling Lager. For an establishment that specializes in Burger's I felt let down to say the least. You can get a far better burger in a number of other places in town. Your results may vary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield
Bill S.,"Litchfield, CT",155,540,1,4.0,11/6/2016,"Yeah, we're fans. The reasons are pretty simple: the burgers are awfully good, the service has never failed to be first class, and you can get a beer or a cocktail or a milk shake (and not necessarily in that order). What's not to like about that? We've often stopped at the Red Robin in Holyoke, but this franchise is every bit as clean and appealing. The crispy bottomless fries are yummy (you can get sweet potato fries, too), and their chicken dishes and salads are good.  Yes it's a chain operation, so let's not be comparing it to fine dining establishments. For what it is, however, it's well worth a stop for the reasons listed above. Cheerburger, dill pickle and a cold beer.

I'm not sure why because he orders the same meal at every restaurant we go to (chicken tenders and fries lol), but today I actually enjoyed my burger (and not just the onions rings).  Usually when we come, I feel as though I could make a better burger at home, but the Southern Comfort (I believe that's what it's called) really hit the spot today. 3 stars! One, for being my son's favorite restaurant. Another because the onions rings are always on point. And the last for my delicious burger and our waitress keeping up with drink refills today.  2 less stars because their burgers have always been just ""meh"" for me, and the seating is always too cramped or as the diners next to us stated "".. close quarters"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield
Mike F.,"West Suffield, CT",0,15,1,5.0,9/25/2016,"I'm going to base my review on this last visit instead of the previous visit where the hostess just couldn't get it together.  This visit the hostess was on it, and the waitress (Yvette) knocked it out of the park. I've recently had to go gluten-free, so I'm still figuring out what I can eat and where.  The GF menu is online, but we were having trouble finding it (you have to select a menu item before it gives you the ""allergen menu"" which will filter everything). 1. Yvette sat down with us and went through the physical menu describing the various options and things to avoid.  This was fantastic and unprecedented. 2.  Red Robin actually has a lot of options for GF eaters.  GF buns for any of their burgers, the fries and seasoning are already GF (and bottomless!).  It's fantastic to see a restaurant putting some obvious thought into their menu options.  I'm sure it's hell for the kitchen staff, but this customer is immensely grateful.

This policy requires your server to ask to see your ID to prove your're age eligible to consume alcohol. This was our senior citizen experience  on June 11, 2017. I challenged their policy to their corporate office and their explanation was that it doesn't have to be posted; that a server can use discretion when someone clearly appears to be age appropriate or doesn't have an ID; that a customer has the option to protest to an on-scene manager; options that were most certainly not afforded us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield
Jeff T.,"Cypress Village, Irvine, CA",159,10,,5.0,2/18/2017,"I have spent way to much money here on food. It's so addicting and so good. Red Robin is by far my favorite burger joint in Enfield. For an app I'd start with towering onion rings and extra campfire sauce & ranch or a sampler of jalapeño coins and mozz sticks. Burger: Burnin' Love. Again...ranch, ranch, and more ranch. Dip it. If you want a more classic burger get the Royal. It's delicious. AND THE FRIES? They're are so good!!(ask for them extra crispy or garlic parm and dip them in ranch) If you're polite and could smile and maybe make eye contact with your server when you talk to them, they'll bring you more fries all the time. Dessert is nothing to write home about. They have a full bar and some cool beer and cocktail creations so there's something for kids and adults.

On our way to Vermont via Route 91, we stopped off for gas and a bite to eat in Enfield and noticed a Red Robin. We thought, ""What is this Red Robin all about?"" Gourmet burgers... hmmmm... yes please! The staff was more than friendly and helpful. Our server, George, was happy to explain the different burger levels and the grade-levels of beef. We ordered the Pepper and Southern burgers, as is, with no customization (which is very welcomed, i.e. you can pick and choose what you want on your burger). We completely enjoyed our meals - the hamburger meat was perfectly done, flavorful and juicy! The toppings were fresh (even the lettuce was delightful and unique - more like greens vs. ice burg lettuce) and the sauces were delicious. We had the option to have more complimentary steak fries, but we were too full - but it's nice to know that more is an option.

Henry F.,"Baltimore, MD",18,222,425,3.0,2/7/2016,"Torn between a 3 star and a 4 star review. RR is honestly not my top choice when I am around the Enfield area but my friends seem to love it so I've ended up there 3 times now. We were on our way back from Mt. Snow and a friend suggested this RR. The burgers are pretty good for what they are meant to be, I do appreciate how they offer the well done option or the 'some pink' option. That way you are not expecting a perfect medium rare burger but hey, it's RR. You come here for a quick burger that's better than fast food but not as good as Plan B. There was a 20 minute waiting time for us to be seated which was understandable, my friend and i decided to sit at the bar and grab a drink which was nice. A couple of beers on tap, we went for the large blue moon at around ~$7. I also tried a mix drink with fireball and peace in it (can't remember the name) which was surprisingly good but pretty weak. The burgers came out in a timely manner and we all enjoyed them. My 5 alarm burger was pretty good and the fries were hot and fresh. I ordered the buffalo sauce, which went great with the secret red robin sauce that my friend had. Bottomless fries came out pretty quickly too! Service was extremely friendly.

We waited about 15 minutes to get a table, which is pretty good considering it was a packed house. Our server tonight was Jessica. She was on her A game tonight. She told us she was newer there but you could tell she is a seasoned waitress. She was very attentive, keeping our drinks full without once being asked. She was very pleasant and very genuine, which says a lot for her based on the amount of tables she had tonight. We both ordered lettuce wrapped royal red Robin burgers. We both asked for our eggs to be cooked a little extra, and they were cooked perfectly! The burger was delicious, the side salads were fresh and delicious. We did split one basket of fries as our way of ""cheating"" and they were cooked perfectly and arrived piping hot. They were nice and crispy, not overdone or soggy.

Elaine R.,"Springfield, MA",2,22,2,4.0,4/21/2011,"This place is usually packed so if it's meal time expect to wait. However, when I am in the mood and in the area, I WILL wait - it's pretty yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
Joann C.,"Miami, FL",140,260,78,3.0,11/9/2012,Just a tourist so I stopped in while visiting.  Just opened 2 in my neighborhood but I had to go all the way to Connecticut to try. Service was good and food was pretty good.  You cant complain about endless steak fries and a great selection of burgers. I really enjoyed the loaded baked potato soup.  I had to share and I instantly regretted it because I would have definitely enjoyed having the entire bowl to myself. Burnin' Love Burger was pretty good and did I mention the endless steak fries? Campfire sauce?  I asked for it...it was okay but I I dont know what people are so excited for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
Rachel L.,"Wilbraham, MA",31,227,69,3.0,5/25/2014,"I am turning into a burger snob.  I can't deny this.  I like my burgers done medium, oozing delicious juices, preferably hand shaped not pressed, easy to eat (like I can actually take a bite & not dislocate my jaw), playing a sandwich starring role, not overshadowed by toppings....it's not easy to please me I guess.  So...Red Robin was just ok for me.  I went with the classic cheeseburger which was ginormous & hard to eat.  My burger was raw right in the middle which I found half way through my eating experience.  I don't like sending my food back so I just called it a night.  From what I did eat, the burger was boring only enlivened by the toppings.  It really had no flavor at all.  It seems like they build a skyscraper of a burger in hopes of getting people to overlook the taste/quality of the meat.  The fries were excellent & thank goodness they are bottomless because they come in a tiny cup!!!!  Service was excellent and, no lie, my Blue Moon was truly a perfect pour....excellent. My kids enjoyed their burgers, fries & bottomless drinks. And also dessert.  They are family friendly which you can tell by the noise alone.  Would I go back? Probably not.  The kids I'm sure will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
Lina C.,"Queensbury, NY",0,17,,1.0,8/29/2014,"Last time we were here they brought my food out after all my party had finished their meal ( so I took it to go ) and all we got was an apology from the server ( who was not our server , but brought out my food) .., no manager came over to at least apologize for the screw up and our server just dropped off the check and disappeared .... Also the table next to us asked for a manager and we heard the managers comments towards that party after they left ( very professional) ..,  Also it seems that they change bartenders and cooks frequently because it is a hit or a miss ... We used to go to this one quite often when they first opened ( when they were actually a very decent place) ... But it has been lacking  in all areas ( kitchen, bar, and servers ) for at least the past two years , and we keep going back once in a while but it just keeps getting worse ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
Clay S.,"Enfield, CT",1,4,,4.0,7/15/2014,this is my go to place for burgers love the service and the food is just fantastic service is excellent and even the prices are ok for a burger joint.

Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",744,2526,266,4.0,11/6/2011,"Good burgers with lots of options for toppings and buns including protein style (lettuce wrap instead of the bun)!  I had the Banzai burger with my friend and it was quite tasty - fresh ingredients and medium rare patty as requested.  The endless steak fries on the side were a nice touch and will ensure that you don't leave hungry.  Comfy, tasty and affordable, what else do you need?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
Jeffrey R.,"Agawam, MA",3,1,,5.0,4/30/2014,"I have to say, this place did a great job to earn me as a customer. The Manager did a great job, as did the wait staff.

Lisa F.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",161,271,243,3.0,2/27/2012,Map a pitstop here during a weekend trip up to Vermont. It was good enough that we stopped on the way back down too! The best thing is the service at this location and the value on the food.  You kind of know what to expect at a Red Robin its not amazing food but its decent.  I was really impressed with how often the waitress came to check on us. The menu allows you to customize your burgers the way you like. I had broccoli for my side but my hubby who ordered fish and chips wanted the unlimited feature that the burger comes with the waitress totally accommodated us with no issues. Drinks and floats are unlimited and our server came to refill and check on us often even when we haven't finished our drinks. If you are a onion ring fan you must get the Tower of Rings!! Its a stack of lovely thick cut deep fried onions served on a tower stand. Sauces were also pretty yummy. Both times we came in were peak meal times and there were lots of kids and people waiting to be seated and we still didn't have to wait more than 15 mins which probably would have deterred us from staying so good job on moving tables and seating ppl quickly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92,3.0,1/24/2012,"We stopped in this location on our way down to NYC as a place to grab a quick bite to eat. The service was great.  Our server was awesome with greeting us quickly and getting our food to us as quickly as possible.   The food wasnt bad - its not gourmet food but genuine comfort food served with endless fries. There are few things in life that are better than endless, fresh, hot fries.   My only gripe about this particular location was that when we walked in after the dinner rush, the place was a mess!!  The tables hadn't been cleared and there was no sign of any recent attempt to do so. Ps- if you don't like screaming and unruly kids, this place definitely isn't for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
cheri t.,"Haverhill, MA",6,225,,4.0,7/16/2014,"We ate here yesterday and it was very good.  First time at a Red Robin and I was impressed.  Service was excellent.  We all had burgers and we loved them.  I did not like my bun as it seemed stale, but beyond that the food was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
daniel r.,"Enfield, CT",1,348,10,3.0,11/15/2012,"Red Robin has a pleasant family friendly vibe to it. Mom and dad can have a beer,wine or mixed drink while the kids enjoy a milk shake. Its well lit..brightly colored and full of eager to please wait staff. not sure about proclaiming their burgers...the worlds best though? i always sense the burgers are so ""doctored"" up with ingredients...i'm not sure if they are any good or not. Last night I had the blue ribbon burger...on the hamburger appears lettuce, tomato,some bleu cheese..crispy onion rings...bar b q sauce..some chipotle mayo...somewhere inside this loaded burger was the burger itself. wife had a turkey burger which she said was delicious...juicy and flavorful. for an app. we shared the mozzarella sticks which were way above average and very good. we also shared a delicious hot fudge sundae for dessert. Our waitress..alicia...was fantastic..made the meal actually.....ready with water re-fills...more napkins..anything you can think of. so..overall..a positive experience...but i just sense the burgers are all ""gimmicky"". its a very basic Ok burger with loads of flavorful extras thrown on top....give us a better actual burger and we'll bump up the rating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
Alison D.,"Stafford Springs, CT",47,122,11,4.0,6/24/2010,"Red Robin has gained another star from me. I went here for my birthday (the birthday club gives you a free burger every year, which is pretty awesome) and my 'burger'  (I'm a vegetarian) was amazing.  They let you sub any sandwich now with a veggie burger, an option I don't think they've always had.  Either way, it was delicious.  And free, which of course made it even better. At the end of the meal, our waiter brought me over a ice cream sundae and told me it was on the house.  This is NOT part of the 'birthday club', so I was especially touched and appreciative.  He was much more attentive and friendly then the nasty bartender we had last time, too.   So there you go, Red Robin.  Another star from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
Pete R.,"Three Rivers, MA",0,33,1,5.0,12/30/2013,Great burgers. A bit slow during lunch rush hour. Very clean inside and out. Had the banzai burger which was outstanding.

Brian S.,"Williamsburg, MA",0,22,,3.0,8/21/2013,"So let me start off by stating, I love Red Robin. I love the Blue Ribbon Burger and I love the staff at each one. There Onion Ring tower is good, but we go like twice a year. So this year, we went for my birthday...and I was liking it. So the next part of this review has nothing to do with the restaraunt, lord knows it was not there fault. A little girl, like 5, vomited up all over the floor and one of my guests shoes. So that was the ugh, part. They were real nice about it, but still it kinda sucked it happened on my birthday...but understandably not the places fault at all! I mean, i asked for a side of campfire sauce not vomit...this is also not a lie or joke, really happened. But restraunt forgave!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
M K.,"Hartford, CT",0,21,,2.0,10/30/2014,"Not pleased with this location. If I wasn't in such a hurry, I would've complained. I just got out of work. I wanted to have a quick meal and to bring something home for my wife. I ordered a burger, medium- medium well. My burger came out chared, very well done. I also ordered a chicken Caesar wrap to go. It was not wrapped real tight and not folded. It was just scrunched up in the wrapper. There were multiple fatty chicken pieces. There was very little dressing. There was also pieces of brown, old lettuce. My poor wife ate what she could of it and had to discard the rest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40

Sheila Z.,"Wethersfield, CT",6,82,1,2.0,7/5/2011,"ok, so I have a Suffield joint that is now my go to burger place - actually tastes like it was cooked on a grill, even though they don't spec. in burgers, I'm ruined.  No matter how much you glop on burgers at Red Robin, it is a basic flavorless burger.  The fries are great, especially kicked up with their own seasoning salt.  Went for their clam chowder but they took it off the menu for the summer. (what!!! soup is good all year) so mom and I got burgers.  I got the swiss mushroom, yawn flavorless until I added their seasoning...won't be back.  I know, make the hugest burger with the most crap possible that slips and slides off when you try to eat it and contribute to Americans pigging out on crap food at 1000 calories per meal.  Sorry but like sponge worthy, this burger joint is not 'calorie worthy'.

Kevin M.,"Enfield, CT",51,10,1,2.0,12/31/2011,Sorry we had to give it two stars.  We've come here a few times and the food is always great but today it wasn't up to its usual par.  Onion rings came to us piping hot and delicious but our burgers and fries arrived lukewarm.  Had they come just as they were done being cooked they could have been delicious.  My fries even were mangled somewhat - I suspect they were cooked in oil that wasn't heated up enough.  Maybe their best people had the day off or they were having technical problems.  This will not stop us from coming here again - we will chalk it up to a one-time thing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40
