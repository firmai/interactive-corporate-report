135,Shyla B.,"Antelope, CA",0,2,1.0,2.0,2013-06-19,"My husband and I had lunch there this past monday. When we first walked in we were greeted and promptly seated. It was pretty dead in there, but it was 2pm. It took about 10mins for our server to come to the table. We ordered our drinks, appetizer, and our meals. We ordered the southwest egg rolls for the appetizer, which came out promptly.  They were ok, not as good as I remember. Five minutes after we received our meals. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos and my husband ordered a plan cheeseburger. The tacos were supposed to come with coleslaw in the tacos with the shrimp. What I got was dry lettuce,  which made the tacos dry. There was some sauce with the shrimp, but the shrimp was pretty dry and overcooked. The meal also came with your general rice and something they call beans that were in a soup cup..it was really watery and very unappealing. .gross. my husband's burger was dry. The service was not great. As soon as we got our food, she went to the table behind us and picked up their check and then came back to our table and asked how was everything. .seriously? You just dropped off our food 2 mins ago, I havent even touched it yet. Another pet peeve of mine, the biggest actually, is right when she put the food down on the table she dropped off the check.  I HATE that. It is so rude, it is trying to rush us and gives off the vibe that they dont care. I kinda understand, to an extent, if they are SUPER busy, but come on. We were probably the fourth table there.The server only came by to refill our drinks and take some plates.  Never said thankyou or you're welcome.

151,Don B.,"Antelope, CA",39,30,,1.0,2013-08-18,"Walked in party of 2, the restaurant was full. No manager in sight, teenager running the floor. She was the bright spot. She got us seated quickly, server came right over and took our order, we never saw her again until we got the check. They seem to have a ""team"" approach to waiting tables. They put 2 servers in a section, you would think that would prevent anyone being ignored, you would think, not so. In the meantime they sat a large party behind us, which became their main focus.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, my wife got the bacon ranch quesadilla's. Her's came out hot and fresh. Mine was stone cold including the rice and beans. I pushed it aside and had to flag the hostess to send them back. The only time we saw a manager, she came to tell ""just so you know, the slaw and salsa on the shrimp is cold so that will make the shrimp cold!"" No kidding? What about the rice and beans? Shouldn't they be hot? The reality mine died in the kitchen waiting for my wife's. She left in a huff and had the tacos remade. The beans and rice were obviously microwaved, The beans were still bubbling when they got to me.  After we were done our sever came back by and in her highest cutesy voice asked how everything was and if we wanted dessert. No, just the check. We then had to wait until she refilled the beverages at the large party behind us to get our check.  Hey Chili's, here's an idea, there are no customers in the back of your restaurants, hire and train expo people and get the managers out front to run them.  If your a manager never ever scold a guest because the food isn't what was expected. I've had food and service as good a Taco Bell.  If your a server had a copy of the check ready to go so your customer doesn't have to wait. That one little detail would have saved her tip. I didn't stiff her, but I only left the 8% the IRS will tax her for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=100,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.244,3.2400000000000007

I order the nacho and she ordered the triple dipper with wings and burger bites. Just appetizers, nothing special. Oh and we order two cokes. It took 30 minutes to get our order. I'm a patient person but 30 minutes for appetizers is ridiculous. The nacho was a joke. On the menu the nacho comes regular and large, I ordered the regular. I assumed (and yes I know what happens when you assume ) that it would be a plate with a decent typical nacho. Nope it was 8 nacho chips with cheese, a bit of meat and a jalapeño slice on each. My wife's wings were barely warm. We asked the waitress about the nacho when she brought it and she stated that the menu says the number of chips on the nacho. Of course my wife immediately looked at the menu and it doesn't state that. At that point I just wanted to eat and get out of there. No use in arguing over the number of chips, it was the fact that for the price it should be ""regular"" nacho. I didn't expect much from this restaurant but expected better service and food than what we received. The bill came to 26 dollars and change. What a waste of money.

26,Denny T.,"Sacramento, CA",187,612,403.0,1.0,2014-05-28,"In February 2013 I had one of the two worst experiences at Chili's. Unlikely ever to come back to any after this last trip. My woman and I wanted to partake in Happy Hour. We proceeded to sit in the bar section and was not acknowledged for a good five minutes. The staff then gave us a menu and did not return for a good five minutes without any offer for beverages or appetizers while getting to order. We finally got to our order of Happy Hour items and menu items. We did not order anything away from the menu. No special customization. When we finally got our order in the beverages took another ten minutes. The first of appetizers didn't arrive for 20 minutes. Our drinks were finished but the server never came back around to check if we wanted another beverage. I didn't bother order anymore beverages. Another family sat down nearby at this time. The got there and was given there beverages within five minutes. At this time my woman and I have already completed the first of two ordered appetizers and our only ordered drinks. Our second appetizer arrived after the family's order showed up. I would say another 15 minutes later. We finally get a second drink, the water we had to ask for and refilled. The rest of our meal shows up ten minutes after. My women and I proceed to dine. We somehow still finish our meal before the family. I gave method of payment for the meal and I had to wait for another tens minutes for the change. The family still ended up with their check and payment before I even get my change. You never know how food will settle with your stomach. You do know when it was not prepared correctly. My lady and I definitely paid tribute to the restroom when we got home. I don't know what was more infuriating.  1- A two hour meal for my woman and I. As opposed to one hour for the family. 2- Wondering why the food took over 40 minutes to get to us. 3- Waiting waitress to come back around so I can order another beverage. Only to wait too long for any attention and not wanting anymore and just wanting to leave. 4- Having to continuously ask for beverages when the staff never came back.  5- Why the waitress hung onto my payment for so long. 6- Why the manager on duty never checked on the dining patrons. 7- Getting sick after going home.  Lastly, the restroom in this facility had COLD water. Anybody that understand sanitary standards, understands this is a most grievous food safety issue. When an employee washes their hands, they have not effectively used the soap to wash away their bathroom business.  I consider service and quality of care to customers as a basis for tips. Service wasn't good, but I still gave my server a tip in spite. By any means this server needs to learn to do a better job. Or this server needs to have a manager that will work. She needs to understand hard work pays. I have already filled out a receipt survey about the location. I have already filed county food violation form. Thank you Chili's for any survey feedback. Perhaps you should not have surveys printed on receipts if you don't address them in a timely fashion. I definitely won't be coming back. Update I was contacted by Chili's staff shortly after the complaint. I revisited another Chili's. My opinion remains unimproved and unimpressed by the chain. It is a shame that quality and service are not what it was once was before the experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=60,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.5960000000000005,2.72

They gave us a free corn dog though so that's cool I guess. My pasta sat under the heat lamp too long so the noodles on top got hard and rubbery.

It had the flavor of fish that was turning bad. Much of that was left on the plate too. My daughter had the kids meal mac and cheese with corn on the cob. Now bear in mind: she is a mac and cheese eating machine. She left half of it in the bowl.  All in all we had a very disappointing meal and we never heard from nor saw a manager.

We recently got a gift card and so we went one night and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems like they had overhauled and greatly improved their menu. I had the tacos which were excellent. I especially liked the grilled fish taco. We all enjoyed our meals. Another big plus was you can pay on the little machine at your table and not have to wait around for your waitress to finally decide to check you out. A great idea for a place right next to a movie theatre so you don't have to worry about catching your movie.

They weren't busy inside which was nice, because we were able to find parking and a table easily. Let me say up front that I HATE the new stupid iPad like tablets that they now have on every table. You can order food and pay on then (credit cards only) but isn't that what a server is for? You can also play games on them but I think eating out should be a special occasion and an event to spend quality time with your family and friends. Not one to have your face buried in another electronic device. Does this make me old? Maybe. My Husband and I always order the same thing every time we go to Chili's. He has the Buffalo Chicken Salad which he loves. It's an ample sized salad with a good amount of crispy spicy buffalo chicken. I always get the Unlimited Soup and Salad Combo which comes with Chips and Salsa, a House Salad and a bowl of Potato Soup. The salad is ok (I'm not a big salad fan) but the Potato Soup is really great. Super cheesy and flavorful and it can be made Vegetarian by taking the bacon off the top. The chips and salsa are really good too, but think they should come free with every meal. They do give a large basket though which is enough for the whole table to share. I can only finish one serving of everything even though it's unlimited. They also have A Black Bean Burger, Enchiladas and a Flatbread Pizza for Vegetarians as well. Service was good and the place was kept clean. I would come back again for lunch because of the unlimited soup/salad/chips combo and the prices aren't bad.

The waiter asked if we need boxes to go, ""no thanks."" Although the spinach queso dip was good, the chips are too thin to support the dip, making it difficult to eat.

It's tradition with a group of my high school friends that we end a night at Chili's. We did this recently to conclude an evening of screaming ourselves hoarse and blowing out our hearing at Aftershock 2015. There are two things that stand out at this Chili's, making it a dependable choice in the Roseville area. 1. Service The waitress we had was a doll. They seem to always be on top of it here. Drinks, appetizers, and entrees were out without much delay at all, and it seemed to be reasonably busy for a Saturday night. They were out of a seasonal cocktail still listed on the menu, so the waitress gave me a recommendation that was on point with what I was originally wanting to order. It was super yummy! My friend asked for a little bit of soda to take care of his low blood sugar, so she brought him a kid's cup and didn't charge him. That kind of thing really makes me want to come back to a place.  2. Quality of Food Chains are often all over the place with food quality, I've found. You visit one location and it could be a completely different experience from another location. I went to a Chili's in San Leandro and it was cold wings and soggy fries. This location serves food that looks exactly like it does on the menu. No gross textures or lukewarmish cold plates to be found here. Good job reppin' R ville, Chili's.

I know what I like to order and now and then they have cool new stuff to try. The thing that separates one from the other of course is the people and atmosphere.  I'm not going to criticize this location, this location is just fine. In my opinion it is like every other restaurant in the area and unfortunately a seemingly growing trend in regards to ""people and atmosphere"".  I try to think of an analogy and think of an amusement park. You know you wait in line excited for a new ride or even a familiar ride and wait, and wait all the while observing the employees manning the turnstiles, collecting tickets, seating a never ending stream of anxious customers to their designated seats while talking amongst themselves about what they are going to do once they finish their shift of this humdrum job.  Again I am not being critical of this Chili's rather what seems to be a widely accepted atmosphere, especially here in Roseville/Rocklin/or California as far as that goes. Most places in this area can get slammed and I understand the pain that must bring. Other industries would love and welcome such a pain!  So ""how was the ride"" you ask? it certainly wasn't exciting or fun for me. In fact I didn't see anyone that appeared happy to be on the ride.

54,Joe P.,"Rocklin, CA",141,434,73.0,4.0,2016-01-18,"I have to be honest with you. I was absolutely *SHOCKED* by what Chili's has to offer these days.  I haven't been to a Chili's in at least a year and their revamped menu is legit. They've revamped the whole thing... and it was clear right from the get-go.  My wife ordered a side-salad and she was totally expecting a pre-packaged, iceberg salad.  Instead, it looked like fresh mixed greens with leafy lettuces (rather than iceberg) as well as other greens.  We were all pretty surprised. All of us ordered something from their new Mexican food menu, beginning with the appetizer.  We ordered chips and guac.  There are two options on the chips and guac - one is table side and the other is ""fresh"" guac... I don't know the difference, but since it was $2 less to have it sent from the kitchen rather than in front of me, I figured I'd order it from the kitchen. For $5.49 you get a ton of guac - probably at least a half-pint.  The bowl they put it in was overflowing and it was very, very fresh... it seems as if they made it back in the kitchen as there were several pieces of guac that weren't fully cut up (but that was fine.. I smashed it up myself).  It wasn't the best guac I ever had - probably because it is majority guac and salsa/veggies rather than what they do at Chipotle - which has serious amounts of other items (like cream). I ordered the three tacos plate.  It came with black beans and w lime/cilantro white rice (notice everyone is moving to this?).  I had one carnitas and I wanted to try their new prime rib tacos so I ordered two of those.  The carnitas had more flavor (as it should) but I can't hate on the prime rib tacos.  They were very tender.  They also put cheese, rice, salsa and a slice of avocado in the tacos wrapped in a flour tortilla (one thing I didnt like... I'd prefer corn). My wife ordered a chicken burrito which she finished... and she NEVER finishes her burritos.  Usually she takes half home. My father in law had fajitas with the prime rib and shrimp.  They looked really good... although I'll admit - they looked significantly greasier than Chevy's.  But he loved them and definitely cleaned his plate. My mother in law had a salmon plate with broccoli.  The broccoli looked like it was just steamed - still a bit crispy and not mushy. My son wanted pizza.... so that is what we got him.  It was almost exactly like Pizza Hut's personal pizza.  Looked and tasted the same.  I don't think they're owned by the same company (Yum brands) - but it seems there is some kind of partnership going on... there are also tweets about it. Anyway - the place was great... have to commend them for getting fresher and healthier. Don't get me wrong, you're not going to save a bunch of calories by going here.... but you'll have much better options. This restaurant is one of many (Red Robin being another) that has that stupid tablet device where you can pay your bill and order stuff.  The ordering didnt seem to work... so it ended up being a huge paper-weight during our actual meal.  The nice thing was, with a 2.5 year old and 8 month old, being able to pay when the kids start to lose it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville?start=20,2.88,2.99,2.99,2.8000000000000003,2.9459999999999997

Recently, I was actually hungry for more than booze and guac (shocker) and ordered vegetable cadillac fajitas. I'm used to any fajita plate they offer coming with tortillas. Imagine my surprise when all I saw was TONS of rice. I was too hungry to care and inquire.  My veggie fajitas consisted of some onions, some bell peppers, a bunch of broccoli (which I wasn't expecting) and rice on top of the platter. I'm used to my rice and beans being on the side....which I still got. So I had a TON of rice.

Our waiter dropped our tray with two of our entrees on it- not a big deal accidents happen and he was very nice about it. This has no influence on my review. Party of 8 with 3 kids, restaurant steady but not slammed. Took 20 minutes for drinks to arrive, another 10 to place order and about 30 minutes for food to come. Since our tray was dropped by son got his meal ten minutes after everyone but my husbands never came because the waiter didn't realize his burrito was on there too. We had to flag down the server for a refill on the kids drinks when we were sitting there for a  very long time in between each and every step. We asked for napkins a few times before they came.

The person who answered the take out phone desk said yes, a full rack of ribs (10) would be $13.99 and would include no sides. I told her I didn't need sides because we were making the rest of the meal, I just wanted to order 4 full racks of ribs only. I asked her how long it would take and how far in advance I should place my order today and she said give them about 1/2 hour because it's busy today (which I expected). But...when I called about 4:30 today, they said there was no such price for a full rack of ribs and that I could only buy the full rack meal with both sides. I told the manager I already had the salad and meal prepared and we only needed the ribs for Father's Day. They said they there was no way they could help me and someone gave me the wrong information. This just ruined our plans for today and we had to rush out and buy some chicken instead. To say the least, I am extremely disappointed that they couldn't work around their ""system"" and help us out, after they gave us the wrong information earlier.

He explained the timing may have resulted in the order being pushed out to the next day since I ordered close to closing.  Hiram was so kind to take our order and make us comfortable while we waited. He even offered us a complimentary soda.  When he brought out our order he took care to give us instructions on how to prepare our molten cake using the microwave in our hotel room. He put the cold items in a separate bag from the hot items. Through all of this he was very gracious and kind. He said he puts himself in his customers shoes and creates an experience he would want for himself. GIVE HIM A RAISE! Chilis should acknowledge and value employees like this.

2,JennyLynn J.,"Fresno, CA",50,4,,1.0,2017-09-16,"We had a server that we only saw long enough to take our order (which didn't come back correct) and didn't see him again. Very inattentive. We were to an an excuse for him by another server but that's not our fault as a guest. Hamburgers were burnt on the outside and both burger and buns were dripping in grease, (as if painted on) so bad there were puddles on the tray.  Won't be back to this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville,2.56,2.85,2.85,,2.734

Initially went well until our food came. Two meals came with cheese when we both asked for no cheese. Took Francis and two other waiters 10mins to bring us a side of ranch, really? We get the tab and we're initially charged for the free veteran's day meal, but he quickly changes that. I had the chicken and waffles, which was really good. Overall service wasn't that great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville,2.8,2.84,2.84,,2.824
1,Aaron T.,"Rocklin, CA",382,188,116.0,4.0,2017-11-28,"This review is a tough one. Chili's is a chain restaurant and you know what that's all about already. Satisfactory food. That in of itself doesn't tell you much. As noted, the food is fine. You pay for -- in this case -- cheap Tex-Mex food. The margaritas are adequate, the chips are good, the salsa is better than expected and the rest is Tex-Mex-iness.  The space itself is, again, unremarkable. The restaurant itself is on the cleaner side, so I'll give it that. Chili's staff are friendly, nice and chatty.  I'm torn, since three stars (""A-OK"") seems low because, as a chain restaurant, I'm not holding this place to the same standard I would a unique establishment. I'm giving Chili's four stars not so much because I'm a fan but because it's a bit better than other bland, unremarkable, boring and blah chain restaurants. Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville,2.84,2.85,2.85,,2.846
9,Anthony M.,"Lincoln, CA",1,29,23.0,4.0,2017-12-10,Chili's is a great place to eat! They have a wide variety of food that the whole family will enjoy. The staff was friendly and the food was great.

4,Phani K.,"Roseville, CA",0,13,12.0,3.0,2017-12-19,"Decided to go to chili's after so long. The server was very nice but the service was really slow. Ordered French fried, onion rings and nachos for appetizers. The nachos were cooked in a way where each chip had a lot of cheese on top, but taste wise it was average. It was lacking more toppings. Then for main course I ordered the grilled chicken fajitas. It was a huge portion, came with 4 small tortillas and lot of chicken. I added my own little touch and put fries in it too, it was satisfying.  I just wish the wait wasn't that long, but overall food was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville,2.72,2.86,2.86,,2.8040000000000003

5,Lauren M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",6,8,1.0,2.0,2018-01-06,I am a huge fan of chillis and came to this location while visiting the area. The service was fine and so was the food. My only reason for such a bad review is how absolutely disgusting this location was. We were sat down at a table with ketchup all over the place and dirty napkins on the table and crumbs everywhere. It clearly had not been wiped down at all. There was only a few other customers here so there was no reasons for this. When asked to get our table clean the waitresses asked the buss boy that was sitting at a table with his friends to clean. He grab a towel and simply pushed all the trash on the floor and sat back down with his friends. All the empty tables were equally if not more dirty then ours. Mean while all the waiters sat around talking and continued to  walking around the mess,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville,2.8,2.82,2.82,,2.812

0,Monique H.,"Sacramento, CA",70,76,107.0,3.0,2018-01-13,"Came in for a surprise lunch for my mom's birthday. So it was a large party, at first the server seemed like she had it handled and was   with drink and food orders. There were a lot of things ordered and many variations of the same thing. Food came out not too long after the order was placed, and the food was tasty and the temperature was ok.  Once the food came the attention from the wait staff fell. Drinks were empty and empty plates littered the table. We brought in a cake and they brought that out but we then had to wait for plates and forks. Overall the experience was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roseville,2.76,2.82,2.82,,2.796
