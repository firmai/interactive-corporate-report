The first time we didn't get seated for 10 minutes because the hostess wasn't paying attention. Then they got my boyfriends and my food wrong so we had to send it back. The second time we went we were seated right away. My boyfriend ordered and beer, we saw it being poured then we saw it sit at the bar for 15 minutes. I had to ask our server if I should get up and get it or if he will.  The third time we went everything was good until we got our food. We had to send BOTH of our food back TWICE!  Won't be back!!

Was seated promptly, and the waitress greeted us quickly and had a drink order in before my coat was off. Then, we ordered.  We ordered an appetizer and 3 entrees.   The appetizers were being delivered as they were being made, but the wings took extra long.  Then, the entrees started to come out.  This was about 25 minutes later. The ribs were sent back because they were cold and extra dry.   The manager greeted us, apologized, and offered to replace them, however, they were the last ribs in the entire restaurant.  Had to choose something else, so I ordered a Parmesan steak and shrimp.  My wife also wanted Parmesan sauce for her steak.  This did not come out for over 20 minutes.  For Just the sauce! Completely unacceptable! I had them package my steak to go, because it took almost 30 minutes for a medium rare steak.    All in all, the food tasted good, and despite what some people say or think, the servers are generally pretty good.  They can't, however, serve food that the kitchen does not prepare, or is ill-prepared to deliver.  Too many servers pacing around tables with no food to bring them.    Fix the kitchen problems!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia?start=40,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
16,Cristina B.,"Chesterfield, MI",260,137,64.0,4.0,2015-03-16,"This brand new location is absolutely beautiful. Without a doubt the cleanest Applebee's I've been to! While the lobby is lacking, I've been here a few times already and never had to wait long so I don't mind. Service can be hit or miss, but I've given them the benefit of the doubt considering they are still a new location. This location has great TVs to watch the game so be prepared for a longer wait on game days! They also have great coupon specials so look for those as well. Applebee's itself is always changing their menu. My guy and I ordered a spicy shrimp appetizer last time and it came out kind of thrown together. Looked nothing like the picture but at least it tasted good! As for my chicken chicken wrap, it was thrown together as well and fortunately, I wasn't able to eat it as a wrap. The whole thing fell apart when the server set it on the table! I would've asked for a new one but I didn't want to bother our already busy waiter.  Despite this, my guy and I each enjoyed our meals and were happy with our overall service.

52,Amanda L.,"Farmington Hills, MI",1,29,17.0,1.0,2015-04-07,"Honestly disappointing. I've never been a huge fan of Applebee's to begin with , always felt like they had mediocre food with not so mediocre prices, but I had a great experience out in Grand Blanc once I decided to give this new one a whirl.  Our server was training someone and the trainee was really nice and attentive but the trainer seemed to care less. The food took a little while considering how slow it was but not too bad. Once the trainee dropped the food off we didn't see anybody for a long time and were waiting to order dessert. The trainer finally came back over and just offered the check, no asking how out meal was, which was pretty gross to be honest, no offering of dessert. Once we ordered dessert he seemed pretty irritated. While waiting for the dessert I over another table complaining about their pasta, which didn't surprise me at all after I read the rest of these yelp reviews. Dessert came out after a few minutes and he dropped the check off and never came back to check on the food yet again nor did he offer a ""have a great day, come back again"". I won't be back again. The service is absolutely horrible (and I've waited tables for 9 years so there is no excuse for this lazy complacent behavior) and the food is mediocre at best. Spend $5 extra dollars and have an amazing meal at outback across the street.

After speaking with a General Manager about my experience, he was gracious enough to give us a gift card to come back and give them another try.  We went to the location at 6 and Haggerty.  I must say the service was spot on, and the food was delicious.   I will continue to support this location while the other Livonia location gets their act together.

We've seen it all, from waiters that smell like 10 packs of cigarettes burned at once, to waitresses families letting their kids jump in our booth while we're sitting there (repeatedly), all served with extremely watered down drinks. One time we walked in around lunch and the music was so loud we had to yell (I mean YELL) to hear each other across the booth. Since then we not-so-lovingly call this establishment Club Applebees.

3,Erica F.,"Farmington, MI",65,62,11.0,1.0,2017-02-04,"Three strikes, you're out Applebee's.  Above the other two lousy experiences I had at this location, this one was the cherry on top of the cake that I refuse to ever come here again. Long story short, we ordered a couple meals from this location over the phone, we came to pick it up, they took the card, swiped it, we signed, we figured the transaction was done. Wouldn't be giving it a one star review if this was where the story ended. A couple hours pass and I believe it is around the time the restaurant must have been closing and we get a phone call from a 313 number so we let it ring. We then listen to the voicemail that was left... There was a few seconds of chatter between employees before the message was left where Applebee's asked us to come up to the restaurant WHILE they were CLOSING because apparently the transaction wasn't fully made. At the end of the message there was more talk between the employees of which I could clearly hear her say ""she'll call back, she was a nice OLD lady""...  We ended up calling Applebee's back to leave them with our phone number because there was no way we were driving up there in the middle of the night for a mistake that THEY made. They never called back, must not have been that serious of an issue.  Don't waste your time at this location. Not to mention, on the last review I posted I received an email from the GM saying to return to their location after 30 days and saying they would be ""back on track with delivering great experience like they should""... Maybe your workers aren't providing this great experience that you speak of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

12,Kate B.,"Livonia, MI",22,2,,1.0,2017-03-18,The WORST car side service. They don't put as much effort into take out in the first place and then make you sit and wait at least 20 minutes past when the food is supposed to be ready. None of the other applebees locations are this bad. I have fallen into this trap too many times.

2,Alex T.,"Livonia, MI",34,234,5.0,1.0,2017-03-25,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am generally a fan of Applebee's.  I don't expect anything spectacular when I go, but I have been to them enough to know what to expect.  This Applebees dropped the ball in almost every way. A coworker and I went there to watch some NCAA Tournament games on our lunch break.  We showed up and there wasn't a single TV with the games on in the bar area.  It's the NCAA Tournament, one of the biggest sports events of the year, and nobody in the place was on top of it.  After asking to have a couple of the TVs switched so everyone in my party could see, it took almost 15 minutes. Our drinks (waters) took forever to show up.  Our waiter messed up our order, which took forever to arrive, and we had to remind him of what we had asked for several times. Overall, it was the worse experience I have had at Applebee's.  Generally, I believe Applebee's is a good value, but this one certainly is not.  It seems that a management change needs to be made because this restaurant has serious operational issues.  I will likely return to Applebee's in the future, just not this location.  There are too many better options within sight of this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-livonia,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
9,Jaki F.,"Livonia, MI",4,3,,1.0,2017-04-01,Sat for about 10 minutes. No drink order but asked to move since the child in the booth behind us was blaring a movie on her moms phone. Once moved we sat for 10 more minutes while waitstaff passed us by 5 times. Left and went next door. Unreal.

8,Malice M.,"Detroit, MI",27,11,,1.0,2017-10-08,"This place is brutal. Went there on Saturday afternoon to grab a quick lunch. Upon entering, there was one single customer in front of us waiting to be seated. The person who I assume was the manager greeted her and said she had to clean a table for her. The manager then proceeded to clean about 8 tables before returning to seat the single customer. I should add that this was around 1 pm on a Saturday and there were no more than 10 occupied tables. After seating the woman in front of us, the manager returned about 5 minutes later to say that she had to again clean a table for our table of 3. There were over 8 unoccupied clean tables and booths available at this time. By now we'd been waiting over 10 minutes to be seated so we made the educated decision to leave and dine somewhere else. This was only the second time we have tried to eat here and actually never made it to a table.

She was throwing up at 3 am and I had to take her to the emergency room, the doctor said all her symptoms were of food poisoning. Also, we sat ourselves at a high top in the bar area, because we stood too long in the front.
