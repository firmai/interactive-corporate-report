1,Angel S.,"Mount Prospect, IL",19,1,4.0,5.0,2012-12-08,Excellent customer service... Have them sing for your birthday! You won't regret it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3?start=20,,,,,
0,Mona A.,"New Orleans, LA",148,38,355.0,4.0,2013-06-11,"I know about the unhealthy reputation of this restaurant....but it has some flavorful food (like any Fridays anywhere). The servers at this location, however, are what makes you wanna come back! Very friendly, caring, and quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3?start=20,,,,,
12,Courtney C.,"Chicagoland, IL",198,839,1924.0,4.0,2014-01-08,"I always forget about TGI Fridays. Mainly because it's in a weird spot. Granted, I'm at the Target in this complex frequently, but this Fridays is wayy further down and somewhat hidden if you're only at the Target. I know a lot of people are reading this thinking ""but it's a chain"" And while I prefer to frequent every non-chain place, I won't deny that I enjoy going to a chain restaurant once in awhile. Fridays has a lot of great drink/food specials and is pretty high on my list of places to watch Bears games. Every night has a different special, including half-prized appetizers, cheap burgers, drink specials, etc. We came last Sunday and the special was $3 appetizers and $3 select drinks. I ended up with two mojitos and a couple of the $3 appetizers, as well as some not-on-special Jack Daniels chicken strips. I thought the appetizers were amazing. I didn't really care for the JD chicken but my husband loved them. I guess I forgot that I'm not really a Jack Daniels fan. The mojitos were amazing too. The service is so-so depending on who you get. I thought it was weird the last time we went our waitress brought our bill halfway through the game and when our drinks were empty. She dropped the bill at the exact time we were ready for our 2nd round of drinks. It wasn't overly busy either. The time before we had great service and an overly enthusiastic waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
2,Gary F.,"Bourbonnais, IL",31,18,6.0,1.0,2014-03-10,"I have been to this Fridays a couple of times, After the first time i never wanted to go back but cannot argue with the wife when it comes to going out to dinner. This last experience really was the last straw..... I ordered the Ribeye and ribs , $24 meal.... wife ordered a salad and my daughter had ribs as well. Service was ok i guess but food was terrible , The ribeye was 1/3 fat.... they claim its 10 ounces but i beg to differ, i ask the server if it was normal for the steak to have that much fat and she said i don't know and walked away, the ""So called"" so tender the meat will fall off the bone ribs we just as much of a joke, my 10 year old that loves ribs and have had many in her short time eating even disliked them. We have been in this area for just over three years and have come to realize that Olive garden and Lone Star are the only places to eat on that side of town. Will not be back to this Fridays period",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3?start=20,,,,,
3,Julie F.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,2.0,2014-04-14,"Ordered petite sirloin, broccolis and jasmine rice. The sirloin was good but definitely too salty. The rice, which should have been a healthier option, was covered with butter and the broccolis tasted like plastic. There were almost no healthy options on the menu. The 2 stars are for the waitress, who was nice",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3?start=20,,,,,
23,J K.,"Manteno, IL",0,12,22.0,3.0,2014-06-15,"Mac and cheese was really good. Had the Philly burger also really good.  Staff was slow today. A bit distracted. Forgot salad, had to ask for silverware. Table not picked up after done. Probably an off night......  :/ maybe Highlight .... Oreo madness!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
22,Dave B.,"Manteno, IL",0,5,,1.0,2014-08-07,Went for late lunch and waited forever to get meal servered. Ordered endless appetizers which also took a long time to come out and waiter never came back to check on us. Had to wave the hostess over to get a second order. Food was alright when it finally got out but did not expect to spend an hour and half for lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
19,Tim J.,"Manteno, IL",16,210,72.0,4.0,2015-02-05,Always quick servuce even when packed...lots of folks running around fetching yummy gastropub quality foods. Awesome juicy  turkey burger...fries with their own spices profile. Very yummy. Drinks cost on the premium side but were very good. Starters were the best...I could see coming here to just nosh apps and socialize even when not hungry. The key here I think is they have the consistency of a McDonalds...but you know....good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
16,Andrew W.,"Bradley, IL",2,13,20.0,4.0,2015-07-08,Always been good and consistent.   Dennis is a great bartender and Peyton is such an amazing hostess.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
21,Aaron C.,"Momence, IL",0,3,,2.0,2015-08-30,One of our favorite places to eat but has declined in quality and service. It would have been 4 stars over the past few years.  Jack Daniels flat iron steak was barely half edible.  Another family member when talking TGIF visits also mentioned poor steak quality recently.  Not sure its the same place we knew.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
17,Samantha L.,"Lavon, TX",0,3,,5.0,2015-09-28,Nice polite service and consistent with the standard set by TGI Fridays. Everyone I ate with got grilled chicken of some sort and as a server myself I know that grilled chicken can slow down a kitchen if things went running smoothly. Everything came out pretty quickly and very well cooked. Our server... I feel bad that I can't remember his name (Brandon maybe?) was great and very sociable.   2 thumbs up for this one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
20,Irene C.,"Midlothian, IL",7,3,,1.0,2015-11-27,Waited 20 minutes.  They whole time there were plenty of empty tables.  Decided to ask what is going on and was told that the servers all had 7 tables and they can't handle any more then that. Lol . It's black Friday.  Do you think they should have had more help. What a joke. Nobody was even moving quickly. At Panera now. Good food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
18,Patrick C.,"Beaverville, IL",0,43,,1.0,2015-11-27,First off why do I have to give even one star? Empty tables all over and no one being seated. Waited about 15 minutes and left. If you don't want my money put a sign on the door saying we are inept eat elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
7,James S.,"Memphis, TN",7,92,74.0,4.0,2016-04-08,"Friday's is Friday's no matter where you are so no need to review the menu. I have the Salmon and lobster plate and it was cooked perfectly. The service was good, we were a large group and the waitress handled our crazy family just fine, lol Bathroom was clean and well kept. My only complaint is that the bar drinks were rather weak. I finally asked for a short glass Crown & Coke one that I could taste the Whisky  and I received what I asked for.  If you are in the mood for TGIF then you won't be disappointed with this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
11,Deidra W.,"Kankakee, IL",41,84,77.0,4.0,2016-06-03,Typical TGIF restaurant.  Service is fantastic.  Menu is large with all different things to choose from.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
9,Cec M.,"Memphis, TN",1,20,9.0,2.0,2016-06-21,"The worst restaurant in this chain is an apt description. Maybe it's the town, but the mood among the bar staff and the waiters that congregate around it is negative and disinterested to say the least.  Every visit here is a crap shoot. I have probably dined here 6-7 times over the last 10 months (very limited dining options in this area), and I'm happy to say that tonight will be my last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
15,Hannah M.,"Manteno, IL",0,12,28.0,4.0,2016-07-18,"Just your average Friday's. This is one of the better locations, though. The service and the food is both pretty good. Super yummy appetizers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
14,Seth B.,"Elkhart, IN",239,142,1.0,5.0,2016-08-07,"Love the staff here!  My mother-in-law left her purse here, and they made sure to keep it safe.  Coming from a marketing event, there was a lot of open cash, but they had such great integrity and every dollar was accounted for.  Ribs were great, too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
13,Kathy P.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,6,,2.0,2017-04-27,"We went to celebrate a birthday. Service was very slow, many empty tables that needed to be cleaned off as people were waiting to be seated. They brought soup and appetizers together, and many wait staff were visiting with customers. 3 people behind bar and it took 20 minutes to get a bottle of beer. This place is unpredictable, sometimes good and sometimes very bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
8,Jon G.,"Manteno, IL",0,44,4.0,4.0,2017-06-17,Always have outstanding service from here.  Food is always good and hot.  It's a chain so you pretty much can make your own assumption!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
10,Dawn H.,"Oak Forest, IL",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-24,"Went to dine in tonight,  seated immediately,  server didn't come,  after 20 mins we had to leave. No reason to not even come take a drink order within that time.  Ridiculous.  Not even busy at 10 pm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
6,Douglas S.,"Peotone, IL",13,18,2.0,5.0,2017-08-15,"I had a really good dinner tonight, started with a bowl of Cheddar Broccoli soup(was delicious), then got the Sizzling Chicken and Mashed Potatoes. Very generous portions and tasty. Wife started with a very nice looking salad, the got a full slab of the Jack Daniels Ribs and Mashed Potatoes. She was very happy with her meal too. Our server was very polite and checked on us frequently. A very beautiful young lady named Ashley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
4,Leslie V.,"Tampa, FL",88,206,585.0,5.0,2017-12-13,"I'm going to tell you why I am giving them 5 stars ...the breadsticks aren't on the menu but you can ask and they are wonderful!! Ok. Maybe they're just a vessel for the melted butter! I have a hard time going to TGI's without ordering the Jack Daniel's flat iron steak. That sauce is incredible! Of course, you have to get it on mashed potatoes, too, which are yummy and do not taste at all like packaged mashed potatoes, but the real thing - just like your grandma used to make!! The sides are also a treat - the steamed spinach if you're trying to make up for all the calories from the food I just mentioned...or the tomatoes and mozzarella salad in italian dressing. Both very good options! My father-in-law always gets the cole slaw and it is crunchy and not too mayonnaise laden, but has a tang to it that is really a nice addition to a heavier meal.Then, they have all the vegetable options: broccoli, steamed veggie mix, fries, etc. Overall, this TGI's is one of the nicest I've ever been to. The manager, Justin, is a fantastic manager and is always going and speaking to people - correcting anything that seems out of place, and generally seems WAY too competent to just be the manager. I'm surprised he's still here and hasn't been snatched up by another company looking for a GM. Every time we go into this restaurant he remembers my father-in-law by name, asks about the family, etc. just from being regular customers. It's a gift. I think if I went into desserts this review would be another page longer. Just trust me and order one. You can't go wrong! Oh! And the margaritas are phenomenal, too!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
5,Donna C.,"Kankakee, IL",0,26,,3.0,2017-12-28,"We lunched at Fridays all the time because we loved the Ceaser Salad and Macaroni and cheese deal. The Mac and cheese had a delicious crunchy topping and eating it was a real treat, but now, wouldn't you know, they just HAD TO CHANGE THE RECIPE and now it tastes crumby, cheap and tastless. How could they do that?  Bring it Back The Way It Was and we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bourbonnais-3,,,,,
