Gayle R.,"Angleton, TX",3,4,7,3.0,3/20/2015,"Service here tends to be slow even if it's not busy.  The food is what you'll find at any Chili's.  I like their menu options as most of it has great flavor and there are plenty of pictures in the menu which I like.  I ordered a sirloin steak there as medium rare and it was very rare.  I have ordered to go before.  If you do that, check your food as my order was VERY wrong and I had placed the order using their online system.  They have you pay the bill now at these kiosk devices which is convenient so you don't have to wait for the waiter to bring the check if you don't want to.  This somewhat takes away from the experience and I feel like I'm doing the work for the staff. Not the best place but for Angleton, there's not many choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Amy R.,"Austin, TX",292,2,3,2.0,9/30/2017,"The food was actually good I asked for extra green onions and they loaded me up like crazy still ate everything, but seemed like the chef got happy or the bartender went to the chef and told them to load it up extra on purpose, also came in by myself to have a beer and chat then the bartender seemed more interested into pouring her coworkers shots and talking about what dresses they bought than into her customers, still tipped well over 25%, but would of liked if the bartender spent more time talking to her guests rather than workers who sit at the booth right next to the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Harry B.,"Houston, TX",155,30,36,2.0,6/28/2017,"Friendly service, tough ribs, wilted salad, less than exciting and burger, reminder of when I don't particularly like eating at chains",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Chuck M.,"Danbury, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/5/2017,"This is the worst Chili's I've ever been to. Service is slow and it's pretty consistently bad. I've been here a couple times to eat and it sucked.... I guess I needed a refresher so we called in an order, and of no surprise to me it took an hour to get the food out. Luckily I was able to stand and watch everyone in the kitchen play grab ass to occupy my time. The restaurant wasn't even half full. Don't do it, unless you would just like to test your patience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Adam C.,"Converse, TX",0,3,,4.0,5/4/2017,"This place ain't that bad as some people say. Although I always did sit at the bar, and wad only in town for a week. But they staff seemed pretty cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Maribel A.,"Freeport, TX",4,44,4,2.0,6/9/2017,"The food was ok, but I was very disappointed in this restaurant that its not being kept clean. I went in the evening and the floors were dirty, little papers every where, you could tell they hadn't swept or mopped the place in a while and bathrooms same thing, floors were dirty. Can't imagine the kitchen. I won't be going back there till I hear from others that they hired someone to keep this place clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Danny A.,"Katy, TX",37,23,,2.0,3/22/2017,Came in Saturday afternoon and the place was out of shape even though it was empty. Tables were not cleaned and the one in the front of the joint took over 30min to be cleaned. The service was slow yet polite. The food was as expected.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Tootsie T.,"Friendswood, TX",58,26,3,1.0,1/22/2017,"Folks, save yourself time and money.   Don't eat here.   Nasty dirty place, food is cold,  service is awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Josh N Laurin T.,"Vancleave, MS",9,10,1,5.0,1/11/2017,Serve is usually slow when we come they can be busy or slow as ever. The best thing about the place is the chips and salsa!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Marlo M.,"Palmdale, CA",17,519,1507,4.0,4/18/2016,Was I surprised how good my steak was ribs were ok chipotle honey sauce was on the bit heat and no sweet but other than that my meal was excellent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton

Bill R.,"Alvin, TX",0,58,5,1.0,10/28/2015,"Is there a way to leave zero stars? I took my staff here for lunch today, mostly because we'd eaten at most of the other restaurants in town recently.  It took 15 minutes to get our drinks and another 45 to get our lunch. The food was mediocre but the service was pure crap. I guess if you are going to suck, suck as much as you can. The server acted as though we were disturbing her. She could only bring one thing to the table at a time, like one glass of water when all 6 of us wanted water. Took her 4 trips to deliver our water.  I asked for corn tortillas and she told me they didn't have those. I asked her to check and when the food finally came out, she tossed a box of corn tortillas at me and said, ""We do have those"", about as annoyed as possible.  Tje dish machine was making some type of LOUD squealing sound like fingernails on a chalkboard.  And that was before we found the hair in the food. Wow, thanks for the 10% discount for the bonus hair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Steve C.,"Angleton, TX",0,3,,2.0,10/13/2015,Even though our waiter was a nice enough guy he was slow and forgot a lot about what to bring after we asked. My friend opened up his napkin that they put their silverware in and a hunk of old food still stuck to it. I agree with the others on here the food is mediocre at best very bland and not fresh tasting at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Corey C.,"Angleton, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/31/2015,"Wow, what slow service...an hour to get a single drink and 2 hours to get a ""hey your foods almost ready"" i most likely will never go there again except for a beer. Because who could mess up that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Joe Michael V.,"Angleton, TX",53,2,,1.0,11/17/2015,"First of all... The food is the same at every chili's. The one in Angleton just SUCKS.... Me and my girlfriend went came to eat lunch and there was about 4 tables. We get seated pretty quickly but wait about 15 minutes for our server to come. The manager is our server, which should be good service right? Wrong.. She was soo slow.. She was pissed. It looked as if a couple of waiters quit and she had to do the work. We went in around 12:30, and didn't leave around 2. Most of the service in LJ and Angleton are shitty anyways, so it's really not much of a Suprise. Don't eat at chili's in angleton. You will get home/back to work faster if you go pearland",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Char F.,"Houston, TX",2,2,4,3.0,7/26/2014,I like that chilis offers healthy options. We ordered an appetizer & two meals that all came out at the same time. My southwest chicken plate had uncooked rice but the manager came to check soon after our order was delivered & asked if she could replace it. Our server is no good though. We are eating & happy finally :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Craig W.,"Angleton, TX",6,50,30,2.0,12/10/2014,This is a typical chain restaraunt. They don't do anything great but you can go to any Chilis and get the same mediocre food. I ordered the lunch special with chicken enchilada soup and a double burger. I honestly don't know how you can screw up a burger but this place does it every time! Always over cooked hockey puck that's way too salty! I ask for a rare burger but they tell me they have to cook it to medium. Their medium is well done! We rarely eat here because across the street is an independently owned establishment with far better food. I wanted to go there but the wife said Chilis. My stomach started churning at the thought of paying good money for crappy food. We eat here maybe once a year and every time we try it? It's still the same old garbage.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Chris D.,"Concord, CA",21,24,3,2.0,11/8/2014,"I've never had as consistently bad service at a major chain as I have at this particular Chili's. Often times my order is wrong, hardly warm, or delivered unacceptably late. I have not been back in over a year at this point, but unless management has changed I'll stick to the Lake Jackson if I need to scratch this itch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Greg F.,"Angleton, TX",15,119,13,3.0,5/16/2013,"It's a Chilli's, we only went b/c we had a gift card.  But it was good for a Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
Kelly L.,"Angleton, TX",1,13,,3.0,5/6/2013,"Normally, service is great at this Chili's restaurant, however, Sunday, May 5th was a totally different experience.  The waitress, Emilie, didn't smile at any point nor did she even make eye contact with either one of us at the table.  She would turn her back and put the food/drink on the table.  We watched to see if it was ""just us"", however, she did the same thing to other guests.  This was sad because it's normally wonderful service.  I normally tip extremely well but at this dinner, I tipped less than 10% and completed the online guest survey.  Disappointing, just disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-angleton
