Technically a black bean burger, this is a pretty good vegetarian option. As far as veggie burgers go, Chili's has probably one of the better ones in the chain restaurant world.

I have food allergies so I requested from both the waiter & manager that there are no peppers of any kind in my meal & no gluten (gluten free menu). I asked for the meat to be cooked plain. I ate my meal not realizing that they went ahead & put Cajun Spice Mix in my food, which is made from several types of peppers.  When I confronted the manger & waiter they brought out the mix which had no ingredients listed, but said no allergens or contains soy allergen. They both said that this is translated to mean I am not allergic to any of it LOL. I had to explain that it means none of the 8 or so main allergens are not in the ingredients & if so, it's listed.  The manager kept asking, ""What do you want us to do for you ma'am"". I said I was trying to educate them that if they don't know the ingredients don't put them on someone's food without asking! I was freaking out & went home to take allergy meds ASAP. The really funny thing is the manager Mike asked me if I wanted the rest boxed up to go!  Pretty sad. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone with food allergies or Celiac Disease.  They brought me plain meat cooked to go but I took a bite this morning & felt nauseous so I threw it out.

40,DB F.,"Roswell, GA",0,18,,1.0,2015-11-07,"We rarely visit chain restaurants, but we had a local high school booster coupon for a free app and we were close by on a weeknight, at dinner hour. My 9-year-old son and I entered and were asked by the unsmiling hostess if we'd like to sit in the bar. Huh? No, I don't usually sit at the bar with my elementary schooler, but whatever. We're shown to a booth in a nearly empty section (the whole restaurant was maybe 1/3 filled.) Our unsmiling waitress came by to take our order, and we got drinks and the app in relatively good time. Other tables became occupied in the area. The minutes ticked by... we began to see others receiving their food. But we, as the first table seated here, and having ordered well before the others, got nothing. I caught the waitress walking through our section and asked if our food was almost up. She said, I don't know. Do you want me to check on it? Yes, actually I do.  I checked the time. It had been fully 30 minutes since we placed our order. She returns 5 minutes later and reports that our dishes have another 5 minutes to go. Really? I ask in surprise. Yes, she says and the unfriendliness transitions to hostility. 12 minutes is how long your dish takes to cook. But we ordered a long time ago, I say, and others who ordered after us have already received their food. Well, they must've ordered something that takes less time to cook, she says with attitude. I can't help how long it takes for your meal to cook, I mean if you want to talk to a manager about it, you can, but that's how long it takes. I put in your order when you gave it to me, she adds with more attitude. I'm flabbergasted at her rudeness and let her keep walking. Then I realize that I'm being treated like garbage in a place I chose to come and spend $. I ask hostess for a manager. Mgr hears the situation and apologizes, and goes to check on food. Surprise, it's ready now. We've been here for 45 minutes and our food (at a chain restaurant) has just hit the table. My son is no longer really interested in eating; I tell the manager that original waitress may not come back to our table. I've lost my appetite (and the food wasn't very good, although they did accommodate special request to leave sauces on the side.) I want to pay check but you're supposed to do so on table kiosk and they haven't accounted for the app coupon we planned to use. I don't want to pay a penny more than necessary for this unfortunate meal. Other waitress comes by and offers to fix this for us; she does. I pay. She comes back by and offers us drinks to go. The manager brings gift certificate for future visit. Nice touch, but they should've comped our meal. I'll never be back. Manager was surprised by my feedback about waitress, who never told us her name so I can't share what it was. However, reading the extremely negative service complaints tells me they have a service issue at this location. The renovation is beautiful, now they need to renovate the staff. P.S. the ticket on our food, which I asked to see, showed that the waitress didn't turn in our order when we placed it with her. Either she forgot or messed up in some way, which may account for her defensive attitude. My son now groans when he sees a Chili's commercial on TV.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

9,Francene T.,"Alpharetta, GA",70,201,515.0,3.0,2016-04-28,"There's a contingent of people who look down their noses at chain restaurants just because they ARE chain restaurants. I'm not one of those people - chains offer standard menus that provide choice, have good routines and processes for quality and cleanliness and generally a pretty strong training component for their staff. That all adds up to a solid food and dining experience for guests. That's exactly what you get at this Chili's - a solid food and dining experience. The interior is refreshed with the new decor/brand look and the menu has new items as well.  THE PLUSES: - the menu has lighter items and they're not all salads - guests have a decent selection of menu items: steak, fish, etc. - the service is prompt and courteous - there's ample parking - the beer list is pretty good  THE MINUSES - appetizers are on the heavy side (I would truly love a restaurant that provides lighter and seasonally appropriate appetizers) - the ""bottomless"" chips/salsa have a LOT of chips and very little salsa - the salsa is really, really unimpressive - the avocado topped sirloin is tender but swimming in a salty sauce (ask them to put it on the side if you order this item) I can't rate their margaritas as a plus or a minus - they're right in the middle. Not the best I've ever had and not the worst. This location is on Windward Parkway near the Hwy 9 intersection - directly in front of Costco, across the street from Walmart and directly beside Macaroni Grill. If traveling east on Windward, there's an entrance directly in front of the restaurant. If you're westbound, the only way to get to Chili's or Macaroni Grill is to turn into the entrance for Costco and then turn right into the shared lot for Macaroni Grill/Chili's. The traffic coming in and out of Costco means you can sit...and sit....and sit trying to exit out of the shared lot.  When dining with several people, Chili's is a good option as everyone is likely to find something on the menu that suits their taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

12,Bo Z.,"Toronto, Canada",0,10,8.0,1.0,2016-05-24,"The food was decent, and the avocado sirloin was pretty good (although, similar to how a previous person has reviewed, the food was indeed, very salty). The service was just terrible, though. So, the terribleness began soon after we stepped inside the restaurant. We waited at the front where they have that little booth where a person usually waits and takes you to a table, but no one came for, what felt like, at least five minutes. The place was pretty empty for a late afternoon (although, seeing how low the ratings were, I'm not surprised anymore), and there were approximately 5-10 small parties (so, maybe 10-15 people there, since a lot of the people there were alone). There were a lot of empty tables too, so it probably wasn't because there wasn't any place to sit or that they were too busy. Either way, we didn't get seated for a really, really long time, so we actually figured the place was closing soon. So after waiting for about 5 minutes, I went outside to check the hours of operation. During this time, a lady came in and started waiting for us. After triple checking the time and concluding that the restaurant would still be open for a few hours, I walked back inside to wait with my family and the new lady. A few more minutes passed, and another person came in to wait with us. So there we were, awkwardly waiting for a fairly long time. Then a person working there (finally) came and seated us, but little did we know, we would have to wait for an *even longer time*. After what felt like ages (I had enough time to slowly browse most of the menu items at least twice), another waiter finally came and told us that someone forgot to tell him we were seated. So while we were giving our orders, I noticed that the waiter didn't bother asking how well my brother wanted his steak done, and the waiter just walked off without ever finding out how my brother wanted his steak. This seemed extremely odd to me, since that always seemed like a thing that would be asked at other restaurants; after all their menu even had a visual guide on the different rarities of steak! So, we wait a while, wondering where in the world our drinks were (we just ordered two glasses of water and some iced tea, so nothing hard to make). I begin to get concerned, because I was worried that they actually forgot about us. Later, my suspicions were confirmed when a group of a dozen people came and sat next to our table. Our waiter later took their order and, soon after, came back with their drinks. So, this felt even more odd, since a large table which arrived after our order was taken got their drinks immediately (same waiter, too!), but we still didn't get our waters! By the time our food came, we asked where our drinks were, and it turns out he forgot about them. Later, the waiter told us it was because he was working too much. So yeah, was going to give them 2 stars just because I thought the food was decent, but giving them one star because the service was just... really not worth going through. The waiter was a nice and friendly person too, I guess, but not very good at his job (along with the other people, of course, including the person who served us).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

When a lady finally came to seat us, she said she had to wipe down a table first even though there was plenty of clean tables available. After seating us, we looked at the menu and by the time she came to take our drinks we were ready to order. She came out with our drinks and my boyfriend decided to get a soda instead of water. Our appetizer came out, then our soups, and I asked her about the soda and she said she forgot. By this time we're done with our soups and appetizer and she says our food will be out in a few minutes. The kids meals come out and the plate is burning hot to the touch. Our food comes out and by this time I'm full from waiting so long. We ask if they can take my meal away and just charge for the soup and she goes to get a manager. The manager comes out and says he would of been happy to if they hadn't already made it because now they have to throw it away and I should've canceled it before it came out. Even though by the time my waitress came and serviced us it would've already been cooking and they'd have to throw it away anyway!! By this time we're all done with our food and we ask for boxes and it takes 10 minutes to get some boxes! Now we're waiting for the check and it takes another 5 minutes!

Surprisingly there wasn't a major lunch rush here even though we arrived around 12 ish. The only large group that was there was a dozen old ladies.  The lunch combo was great: portion, taste, and price. The chicken enchilada soup and chipotle chicken fresh mex bowl were delish! The soup was warm and flavorful. The crispy tortilla strips atop the soup gave it a nice little crunch.  The bowl was great as there was a punch of flavors when I mixed all the sauces in. There was a good portion of chicken along with a few small slices of avocados. I honestly didn't expect the kick of flavor. I guess the best part was that it was only $7 plus tax. Yes! They had a good variety of choices for their lunch combos: $6, $7, to $8 entrees with a side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
11,Amna K.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,2,,2.0,2017-01-21,It's very dirty from inside and server sat us on a dirty table . And I told her I cannot sit on that dirty table and she says I will clean and then she moped from down where all food debris and French fries all over the floor. And 90% of the place is available for sitting.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
15,Carole K.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,3,,1.0,2017-01-29,"I have had some experiences I would expect from Chili's.  This last one was very disappointing.  The picture of macaroni and cheese looked quite tasty; however, upon ordering it looked like Kraft and tasted like it too.  The fried chicken fingers tasted like the oil was old.  Very disappointed in the quality for a Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
4,Amber W.,"Duluth, GA",168,85,42.0,5.0,2017-02-10,"Came here for lunch with a coworker around 12:30, and there was no wait! The host was very humorous and friendly, and our server Brandy was the best! We got the 2 for $22 and couldn't agree on an appetizer, so she did her best to accomodate us as far as price/selections.    I got the 6oz sirloin with wheatberry rice and quinoa blend and broccoli. There are plenty of healthy options here which was great since I am on a diet. My coworker had the texas cheese fries and quesadillas. The food was delicious and fresh. You could tell everything was made fresh not frozen! I was even surprised that my coworker who usually doesn't tip, left Brandy a $7 tip on an $11 bill.Lol. Overall it was a great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
5,Sandeep G.,"Alpharetta, GA",37,214,6.0,3.0,2017-05-07,"When we reached the restaurant there was no host/hostess. Someone came a few minuted later and got us seated. The server came little later and took our order. Our drinks and the appetizer came after a while together. Our lunch order took a while, much more than it should have. While the Appetizer was great the Chicken Fajita had no flavor and was a bit chewy.  The best part of our visit was our server who was very pleasant and hospitable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
7,Sonja K.,"Blairsville, GA",25,21,18.0,2.0,2017-06-18,Went here and there was several tables available. They said it would be a 40 minute wait. That is unacceptable when the place wasn't even full and we saw at least 10 tables empty,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
8,Katherine D.,"Marietta, GA",2,2,,1.0,2017-07-27,"I'll never go back. Takes someone forever to seat you, then you have to wait a while for your server to come by to get your drinks and bring them back. I've been there when it's busy and when it's slow. Same shit.

1,Lincoln M.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,11,,1.0,2017-10-08,"The service is absolutely terrible. Last Thursday night, I placed an order for pickup. After arriving there, I waited at the To-Go station for about 15 minutes before anyone came to find out whether I needed assistance even though they had all walked past me several times. Granted it wasn't her fault but the waitress could not find my order in the system and I had to call home to verify that the order had been placed at that location. Ten minutes later, she finally found the order sitting on the service counter. Terrible experience. Today I placed the same order for pickup. The pickup went well and I got home only to find that my order looked completely different from the Thursday night order. The most annoying thing was that my fries were missing and my sauces were nowhere to be found. I called the restaurant to try and resolve the matter and spoke to the manager on duty. She was absolutely rude and didn't even bother to offer an apology to diffuse the situation but proceeded to tell me how I was wrong about what I should have expected in my order. As for my sauces, her ""generous"" offer was that I drive back to the restaurant and pick them up. I'm done with this restaurant, I'm not a sucker for punishment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

I love coming here for happy hour their prices are good and the drinks are surprisingly strong. I've always sat in the bar area and the service is always quick. I've had the server Quiana a few times and she's definitely the best.  She is friendly, personable and just overall pleasant. The trivia is super fun and the Southwest egg rolls are my fav.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alpharetta,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
