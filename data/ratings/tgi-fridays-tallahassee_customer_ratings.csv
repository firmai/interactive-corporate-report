24,Lee A.,"Tampa, FL",22,30,6.0,2.0,2012-01-05,"First off, let me begin by saying, this is a typical T.G.I.F's.  I have never really gone to a Friday's to enjoy the food, and this one is no exception.   Any time I have gotten food here it has usually been just, ok.  Normally, if I go to a Friday's it is for the 2 for 1 drink specials, and my normal food/drink spots are either closed, or I did not feel like driving to the other side of town. I came here on Christmas night, after a long, long day with the family.  At the time it was the only place open, so I stopped in for a shot or two and some beers.   They were out of Jameson, which was extremely dissappointing.  I settled for Cabo Wabo and Crown, which not to say is a bad choice, but this particular night, it wasn't my first choice. Merry Christmas. Hah. I did not order food, because they were extremely crowded, and I had already eaten my fill of Christmas food. The prices are average compared to other chains like Chili's, etc.  I would have preferred Chili's. Friday's is a last resort for me.  2 for 1 is my only motivation for going there.

23,Beka M.,"Tallahassee, FL",7,115,24.0,1.0,2012-02-27,"I can't even give this a 2 star, although I agree with the other reviews. The food here really used to be better.  They have ruined many of the recipes over the past few years.  This was my last visit.   The chicken picatta pasta had an entire jar of capers in it & the sauce was mediocre.  The mexican chicken salad had maybe 1 ounce of chicken bits on it, mostly just big hunks of lettuce & a few chips. It didn't even feel like a healthy meal.   Maybe their burgers are still good but I would not dare try anything else here until they revamp.   The wait staff are very young and random in quality.  Ours was polite but it was really hard to get our check and get out of there. I think that took half the time we were there.   They'd better strengthen their cocktails, that's all they have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

26,Mark E.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,375,190.0,3.0,2013-12-04,"i happened to be in Tallahassee for a wedding and pretty much nothing else was open but this spot. i gave it 3 stars since i'm comparing it to other Fridays that ive been to. its a TGIFridays, what did i expect. i always go for the appetizers when i come here (which, to be honest, was about 10 years ago). we ended up getting- wings, nachos and spinach dip. i think thats all we got. we pretty much just drank. but, everyone was friendly and it was close to our hotel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348
28,Corey F.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,2,,1.0,2014-04-13,I took my family out for a Sunday dinner.  We were not impressed with the food.  Our salads mostly consisted of heads of lettuce. The Caesar dressing was not good.  The lobster on the salmon dish were hard. The ribs were bland and overpriced for the quality of meat I was served.   Food was not worth the money. I will say that the waitress was very nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148
22,Jonathan D.,"Cairo, GA",1,26,4.0,2.0,2014-06-29,Just went here and was not happy with our food. The service was great. Got the ribs had no meat on them. The chicken and steak were very tough.

8,Jazmine H.,"Atlanta, GA",43,41,82.0,2.0,2015-03-18,"Okay so I was really excited to go to Friday's because when I was home in Maryland I had the jack Daniel sampler and it was really good. So my bf and I went to Friday's tonight and it was just ok. The server CJ was cool, his service wasn't anything spectacular. Now I ordered the Tuscan spinach dip and it was great. The entree I had was not. To be honest the shrimp was dry, over-cooked and hard( I had to send them back and get a freshly made order) The chicken tenders literally looked like mush and the ribs were not the best. Maybe I was too excited to eat. The Mac and cheese was okay (too much breadcrumbs, not enough cheese). Finally the price I paid for everything $51 definitely does not match what I got. I feel like Friday's is very overprice for the quality. I probably won't be returning to this location. It's a shame that's it's so mediocre!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee,,,,,
18,Bob M.,"Whitman, MA",9,48,14.0,2.0,2015-03-18,"The staff here is extremely friendly, however that's where the praise stops. They do not participate in many of TGI Fridays' promotions. Also their beer selection is far too limited. I came for the bar as it was close to my hotel and was disappointed by the lack of craft brew on tap. It's 2015 and Budweiser's market share is way down. Give me something local or interesting that I have to come to Florida to get. I know you are TGI Fridays, but I can tell you that your locations across the country are doing a much better job of providing local fare to their consumers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee,,,,,
27,Kira V.,"Carmichael, CA",1,22,3.0,1.0,2015-04-08,This was my first time here at this Friday's since moving to Tallahassee. I was so excited I had literally been waiting weeks to go here. We had a gift card from my father in law and It couldn't have been a better place to have it. So I thought. We decided to sit out side. The lady arbiter from told us to pick a spot and shed follow. Well she didn't. We sat at our table for 15 minutes no menu or drinks.  In fact the people who came in after us already had both. Three waitresses walked around us before I had to make a fuss about being forgotten. The beer was served hardly chilled at warmed up quickly. The food was pretty low quality. I've had better $6 burgers at hardy. This place was incredibly disappointing. I will not be returning. This was a waste of even a gift card. I do not recommend this place at all. Also upon walking in I see a huge sign that said this TGI Fridays does not participate in endless appetizers. I feel like the big question is why are you still piggy backing off the name of the restraunt? Your service food and atmosphere is terrible. You all are ruining TGI Fridays for everyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee?start=20,,,,,
21,Peter I.,"Summerville, SC",4,5,3.0,1.0,2015-04-18,"Absolutely awful!!!! They don't participate in endless apps like every other TGIFRIDAYS does. What makes this place special that they don't have to do what all the other Friday's do is beyond me. However, they set themselves aside to be worse than any other Friday's. I for one will never eat here. TGIFridays are normally very good, just avoid this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee?start=20,,,,,

15,Ricky A.,"Tallahassee, FL",276,53,241.0,4.0,2015-08-02,"My friend and I tried to eat at Miller's Ale house and forgetting there was a fight aired that night so the wait was about a hour.  We then decided to check out Friday's and in less than a minute we were sat, greeted, and ready to place our order with Sean, our server.  Sean was very helpful when we ordered our drinks and food because I haven't been to Friday's in a little bit, so I definitely wanted to try something different on the menu.  We did ask about the bottomless Appetizers and unfortunately this Friday's does not participate in the promotion.  I was confused about this due to the commercials being broadcasted on all local channels.  I ordered the Pick 3 (Mozzarella Cheese Sticks, Siracha Hot Boneless Wings, and Pot Stickers) as the appetizer.  To drink we ordered the Ultimate Margarita and Very Berry Mojito.  And finally for dinner my friend has the Chicken Pasta and I had the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese with Steak Fries.  All the food and service was great!  It's all was Friday at TGIF (-:",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee,,,,,
9,Jean L.,"Tallahassee, FL",132,53,57.0,4.0,2015-08-12,"This is a classic place for a bite to eat or a drink with friends. I frequent this location often and in this visit I decided to get something different and I didn't like it at all. It was some type of weird oversized nacho with ground beef and melted cheese over it. I tried to like it but I was done with it. I should have gotten the same thing I get every time I eat here, Cajun Chicken Pasta. This has to be thee best dish TGIFriday's has on their menu. Some may disagree but it's perfect! The right balance of chicken to pasta, creamy sauce, Cajun seasoning and bell peppers make this dish my favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee,,,,,

12,William S.,"Aiea, HI",176,6,1.0,1.0,2016-05-25,"Service is mediocre at the best. I've eaten here sparsely over the last year, mainly for the fact of the service and lack of pride that these workers have here. Over our 1 hour stay I got a water refilled once when I had to personally ask the server to refill them (mind you my glass was empty for a good 20 minutes). Our food eventually came out from a woman I assume works in the kitchen and at that point out server didn't not speak to us until we were ready to get our check and leave (roughly another 20-25 minutes). Overall the best aspect of our visit was the food but when it comes to servers and workers here, beware, you've been warned that you will be severely let down with the lacking of personable workers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee,,,,,
10,Don U.,"Melbourne, FL",17,94,110.0,3.0,2016-06-28,"The service was better on this trip.  I.B. the Bartender was cool and was attentive to the bar unlike my last visit, so it is a little Russian roulette here on the quality of service.  They prompt you to order doubles, not just this location, because I think they know people are accustomed to Chili's, Applebees, and the like where happy hour is two for one....but that is not the case here....not that I order doubles...   I don't want to give them a bad review...but Ruby Tuesday is two miles up the road...if I was just cruising through and I wanted service that is routine of a national chain, I would go there.  I am here because Holiday Inn is across the street....and I considered ""The Village"" next door first, but that's like Denny's, good...but not in an evening night cap way.  Again, I don't dislike this place....it just isn't on que with customer service.  They are more like a local place and if you aren't local you are welcome but not too much.  I.B. was good though.  I guess that's a rut that can happen and I understand that...but...it's a national chain...act like it....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tallahassee,,,,,

The food was very well packaged and hot. I was disappointed, however with the lack of onions in the French onion soup and the side order of tomato and mozzarella salad.

1,M C.,"Tallahassee, FL",113,1,,1.0,2017-12-22,"I have been coming to TGIFridays since my days in college. Each time I order the same three things. And each time I have mash potatoes and broccoli for my sides. This particular time, probably my last time going, I ordered my usual. Jack Daniels chicken with broccoli and mash. The waitress, who was new, brings it and the mash has cheese on it. I've NEVER had mash fro TGIFRIDAYS with cheese. I ask her to take it back and make some with no cheese please. She's ok!  13minutes later, the waitress apologizes and says they can't make it without cheese. I feel it's a joke. I've never had an issue having no cheese at TGIFRIDAYS or any restaurant. Due to the late notice I have completed the other portion of my meal so I do not ask for a substitute. She brings me my bill and charges me for the mash. I ask for a manager.  In my many visits to many restaurants, any time I or a guests at my table sends anything back to the kitchen, a manager always comes and see what the problem was and ensures it to be out promptly.  This manager immediately looked at me like I was wrong for asking to speak with him. He told me they NEVER make mash without cheese. I told him that's a lie since I live nearby and come by quite often. He tells me it depends what time you come. So since I did not come late or early enough before the pre-made mash was prepped, there was no way for me to get no cheese in my mash. He never asked what he could do to make up for it. I had to ask can that be taken off my bill. Arrogantly, he said yes.  I won't be back to this location or to this chain from here on. Who knew I'd have to time it correct to get no cheese on a side item.  I felt my food allergy caused me to have a horrible dining experience.
