Theo N.,"Detroit, MI",29,4,2,1.0,10/22/2017,"Third and final time here  1 waiter and 1 manager and its busy  we've been waiting for our food for almost 30 minutes, still no silverware, people are waiting to get seated.  This place NEVER has enough staff and the food is usually cold by the time it comes out.  We figured an early Sunday lunch would be quick but it's been a horrid experience. Edit.... We walked out after 40 minutes.  Food came but no silverware nor napkins.  Couldn't even wash our hands because the bathroom had no soap or paper towels.  Manager was extremely rude.  We asked him for Napkins and he LITERALLY stormed off, never brought us any.  We walked out after clearing it with the waitress (the 1 that was actually working) that we're not paying for our food since we hadn't even paid for it.  There were several couples waiting to be seated, one couple said they've been waiting for 20 minutes just to get seated, and when we were walking out, the gentleman asked the Manager (who came up at that point) if they don't have enough people working...and the manager replied...why don't you fill out an application if you want to work here.  We're going to stick to the TGIF in Southfield, where they actually have enough staff and you won't have to wait for 40 minutes for a small meal.  We drove to another restaurant down the street, were seated, had our food, and finished, all in less than 45 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=20
First-class R.,"Allen Park, MI",23,39,24,3.0,10/12/2016,"Across from the mall, movie theater, and other restaurants, and shopping. There's a variety of food options, and drinks. Really nice rewards such as free desserts, and foods if you have the Friday's reward card. I love TGI Fridays, but they seemed to have sky rocketed their prices on most dishes without upgrading customer service or quality of food. The food is good when it's made when ordered, and fresh. I was disappointed in my sizzling shrimp and chicken it didn't come out sizzling or hot. I also ordered a brownie obsession, and the brownie was delicious. This was my first time coming to this location in years, and the first impression wasn't so good, but I am willing to give it another try in the future. My bill came to $50 dollars for two dining in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=20
Moe M.,"Dearborn, MI",5,29,33,1.0,4/11/2017,Do not ever come here. The food is crap. Everything is from a box. They took almost 2hrs to make fish and chips which I didn't eat because it was so bad. In fact I didn't eat anything. I just paid 46$ for nothing and have a tip to the waitress cause she was nice and left. Paid for a stomach ache and wasted 2 hours of my life. Do yourself a favor and never step into this place. I rather pay 70$ and not come then be forced to come and try eating here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=20

Then I say I don't need a menu I want the endless apps, guess what they not doing it today. So I go to order a long island only to find out it won't have vodka WTF, also no draft beers.

Chanel B.,"Detroit, MI",0,1,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Terrible customer service and food. Me and my friend decided to go there, we waited around 10 minutes to be seated, (the restaurant had less than 20 people in there). when seated the waitress only had one menu for us. I ask for the burger and she tells me they're out of burgers, I ask for a few more minutes to decide on something else then asked for wings. She tells me AGAIN they're out of wings. I wasn't even really mad about that part, she couldn't control that. The worst part comes when we get our food. She forgets the soup, ranch for the salad, and my tea (that I asked for three times before, making sure she got it). 30 minutes later we're still waiting for our food/drink. Meanwhile we see her come in and out of the kitchen giving other customers their food. Not once did she check on us, after giving us our food. We call over the manager to tell him our problem, another 10 minutes pass by and we're brought the soup, which is cold and disgusting and the tea is watered down. At this point the manager sees we're pretty much over this, he offers us a free dessert meal, but the customer service is so terrible I can't see myself coming back here. However, the manager was nice about it, he took care of our check.  I work in retail, I know how a customer should and shouldn't be treated. Never in my life have I ever experienced that kind of customer service. Don't eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=20
Jessika B.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,13,,1.0,5/20/2017,"The only reason this place gets a star is because Yelp requires you to give them a star. My husband and I called at 12:45 am to inquire information. The phone was never answered, so we drove from the airport area to there. At 1:07 am we were told the kitchen is closed. So now we were left to finding a place to eat. I would NOT recommend anyone to go here. Go to Baileys instead, it's 5 mins away and you would love it.  TGIF in this area as MI needs to get it together.

Sarita M.,"Detroit, MI",128,112,40,4.0,10/15/2016,Hmmmm I think they might be under new management. I will admit the first few times I've had food at this Friday's location I was not please. I came here by mistake thinking this was a different location and I'm pretty glad I did.  It started off a little shaky with the overly aggressive greeter but it was awesome from there. The server was really good. I wanted something that was taken off the menu and he worked with me to get the food that I wanted. It didn't take long to come and it was delicious! Mouth watering! The few suggestions I have. Tell the guy at the front to calm down. He's the first person I see and he has a huge role in making my experience a pleasure he ruined that a little by being too militant. Also on holidays they should be fully staffed. The wait was longer than it should have been to be seated. There were a lot of open tables .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=20
Garen M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",45,609,4,4.0,8/23/2016,"We needed an easy to find place to meet a long lost friend. I had seen this place while driving around the town so I suggested we meet there. After the suggestion, I read these reviews and thought ""I have made a bad mistake"". We arrived to a courteous and helpful greeter and the experience got better and better. We had a clean place, very good waiter, delicious food, a good dessert. During our meal, the waiter and the manager checked on us a few times. The manager said she was new to this store. She was doing a great job - directing traffic, buzzing in and out of the kitchen, carefully watching the wait staff and offering help and advice. We were very pleasantly surprised.

Yesterday evening my friend and I decided to go to Friday's restaurant with the hopes of good food and a drink . We walked in and the waiters did not greet us for a while so we decided to sit at the bar . While at the bar about 4 waitress or bartenders walked past us and didn't offer us anything . We had to get up and ask someone in take out to assist us. The bartenders were cursing and being unprofessional to one another in front of the customers . A gentleman sitting next to us at the bar received under cooked chicken , another gentleman coming to pick up take out walked out because he was there for 30 mins and his food was not ready even though he called and ordered ahead of time . On top of-the employees being unprofessional, the manager was just as bad . The gentleman sitting next to my friend and I told the manager  about his under cooked food and the manager raised his voice at this man . At that point , I knew it was time to go .

Like getting a C after months of D's and E's. Good news - good service friendly staff, manager visible and doing rounds. Bad news mediocre food not terrible just nothing to rave about. I had shrimp and chicken pasta . It was not hot enough, but cooked well. Soup was broccoli cheese, just strange, cheese not completely melted into the soup. Free refills on drinks but forever to get there. Food was a little slow getting there but since we weren't in a hurry didn't really effect us.

Then they skipped us in line to be seated saying they called our names while I stood next to the hostess the full 45 minutes and they did not call our name. Then they sat us at a table gave us a kids menu with no crayons, I asked about crayons and the hostess had the nerve to say we are out right now because they are in the back. Stood there and waited for her to go get them. Then the waiter stopped me halfway through my order to go get the table next to us ranch and napkins.

Rea F.,"Chicago, IL",62,37,6,1.0,4/7/2017,"Title of my review for this TGI Fridays: ""SAW 17"" It first started with me ordering online. I never ordered from this location before. But, being a busy mom, wife and nuclear engineer, I place most of my orders online at a multitude of restaurants, including when I travel to different states for business. Based on my usual online ordering experience with other businesses, I perceived my order would be processed with efficiency and alacrity. My family members and I have dietary restrictions which include no dairy and there was no option to exclude dairy via mobile online ordering. No biggie - I do this all the time and I usual just call and state ""no dairy"". This is when the scary movie, ""SAW 17"" began: I called and a gentleman answered. I stated I ordered online and needed to make sure there's no cheese or butter on any of the entrees. The gentleman said hold on and that he had to check with the cooks and then put me on hold. I was on hold for approximately 7 minutes before someone on their end hung up the call. I thought, ""no worries, I'll just call back to confirm"". I called back, a young lady answered the phone. Before I could finish saying my second word, the phone was placed on hold again withOUT the lady on the other end saying anything (cue scary elevator music). I waited for 5 minutes on hold then hung up. I tried calling back several times and someone kept picking up and immediately hanging the phone up. At this point, I'm like ""I must be getting punked by Ashton Kutcher"". So, I gave up calling and we headed to the restaurant. My hubby called on his cell phone, thinking they must have caller id and were avoiding my number. He called within a few minutes of me and someone actually answered and let him talk!!! So he requested no cheese / butter. You'd think that's the end of the scary movie right? Nooooo.  We get to the restaurant and say a prayer before I walked in, not sure of what to expect. I walk in and the restaurant is at about 20% capacity i.e. there's hardly anyone in there. Hmmm, the phone lines clearly weren't busy because of a rush of people flooding the restaurant. I go to bar and my order is ready (this should cover the minimum 1 star rating). There was no cheese on one entree, but butter on another entree. Also, the rice was placed in a sandwich bag on top of the other food in the same container. For some reason, this was only done to one of two entrees that included rice. I showed it to the bartender and he said, ""that's weird. Why would they do that?"" (cue the suspense music). I politely asked for the manager while in direct line of site to the kitchen / staff area and see the manager near the doorway. The bartender told the manager I requested her. That's when she disappeared and I waited over 10 minutes. (Suspense music gets louder) I decided to walk to the entrance of the kitchen doorway and I must have caught the manager off guard because she clearly was intending to walk in a different direction. She was polite enough to stop at my request and walk with me to the bar. I politely, with a smile, explained to her the issues and asked for accommodation. That's when I noticed her back-up / body guards (a.k.a. other staff) roll up to the bar, appearing to be on standby. (Gut-wrenching scary music playing now) The manager, after I asked, told me her name was Maryann Bohm and stated TGI Fridays typically places food in sandwich bags and that it's done at a lot of other restaurants.Yep - she said it with a straight face. I think I lost all the color in my skin when she said that.... I travel 2 - 3 times a month for business over the past 10 years with the same dietary restrictions and never witnessed rice placed in sandwich bags inside a carryout container  -  I've seen pickles placed in sandwich bags, though ;-).  I asked to have the rice placed in a typical carryout container and she obliged.  Yet, I'm terrified at this point and thinking I don't want this experience to get any scarier. So when she offered two free appetizers / dessert cards - I took them with the food and ran!!! I won't use them at this creepy location, though. I will say I appreciate Maryann for at least trying to make amends. However, I now have the unfortunate experience of saying I was in the movie SAW 17. :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn
Jessica P.,"Romulus, MI",0,15,2,1.0,12/6/2017,"If I could give them 0 stars, I would. I stopped here with my sister as I wanted a Jack Daniel's burger and a beverage. I usually go to the location in Canton with no problems. I walked in right before 5pm on a Wednesday afternoon. The restaurant was completely empty other than a table that already had their food and bill. A waiter came and seated us and. said he's leaving but someone will be with us soon.  The waitress arrived and we ordered 2 Jack Daniel burgers, cooked different ways. She returns with our waters, we order drinks and they are at our table by 5:05pm. By 5:30pm a few more parties had come into the establishment, ordered and were receiving their appetizers. We had nothing. I tried multiple times to get the waitresses attention to ask but she never looked at us and seemed to avoid walking by out booth. By 5:40 I go to the bar and ask for a manager as I can't get my waitresses attention. 5:45 comes and the manager and waitress come with our burgers, but don't know which burger was cooked which way. I asked the manager if this is normal for your waitress not to know what the cooks made and if 45 minutes is the normal turnaround time when we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 30 minutes. He didn't have much to say. The waitress took our burgers back to ask the cooks and returned them at 5:50 and STILL told us incorrectly which was which and we had to cut them to figure it out. My whole experience was terrible here and I was leaving by 6:15 - more than 1 hr in a place that didn't have many customers for 2 simple burgers. The the quality of the burgers was terrible. If you've had a Jack Daniel's burger, this was nothing like it. There was minimal sauce and the burger was barely put together and cheese not melted...I'm not sure who was running the kitchen.

They left us waiting 10 minutes in an empty waiting area. Unreal. Who are these guys? They don't even know how to follow Friday's procedures.  We ordered two desserts and both were small in size.

They are heavy on bar promotions, so happy hour provides the best pricing for apps and/or drinks. I go on Thursdays for $3 appetizers. My favorites are the wings (of course) and the BBQ chicken flatbread.

I had not been to this location in years, it uae to one of best around... today... worse than the Southfield location. Lets just go down the list shall we.. DISCLAIMER: it was crowded in here at all 1. They only had 2-3 wait staff in here... on a Sunday... tried their best, they really did 2. We were there for 3 hours and orders only started coming out about 95 minutes later 3. They came asked what were missing 5 times and still didnt get it right. (All of us ordered endless apps) 4. When the food was finally received (a lot later and not the right food)... it was COLD not warm but colf I am beyond pissed and hungry 5. Its bill time, we are already still hungry and pissed and the bills are wrong. They charged the appetizers as individuals and not the endless. It charged each if us for like 3-5 orders, when only 2 or 1 each and they were cold. The managers were laughing because the bills were messed... if only they knew we all were online reviews and social media post! And we so calling the customer service relentlessly this week! I do not recommend this location, if you want some TGI, go to the Troy location on Big Beaver.

Elizabeth H.,"Taylor, MI",20,26,12,1.0,3/26/2016,"oh, so having skimmed some of the other reviews, I see that I am not alone. went last night around 11ish to meet an acquaintance at the bar.  Parking lot FULL of pot holes and uneven pavement.   First thing walking in I notice that the clientele has DEFINITELY changed from when Fridays first opened. That was my first warning sign.  Go to the bar, sit, and notice it's basically full. Great. 3 people working the bar. Ok. Person that I hear the most is actually a worker who isn't on the clock I assume since she is so freaking loud. Apparently she is more important as all the staff is deep in conversation. OK.  I got a thing with talking staff... I hate it and in most cases is unacceptable. Anywho, after about a 5 minute wait just talking to the person I came to meet, no acknowledgement from staff, someone, Jasmin, finally comes over and I order a cranberry juice.  That's it. More conversation with girl in the corner. Finally get my drink. OK.  I observe stacked up dirty plates on the counter as well as behind, napkins and wrappers on the floor, like it hasn't been swept in a few hours that the staff continue to step over. SWEEP IT UP, I was so annoyed lol  The off the clock loud girl is still having conversation with staff and a gentleman who is clearly a regular as staff look at his phone.  Acquaintance leaves.  I stay cause I'm out this late might as well eat something. Order basic cheese sticks. Order goes in and I sit. As I am sitting I notice that people who have been there a while due to the stack of dishes finally seem to be getting their orders.  Food is coming out slow. Great.  The couple next to me got boneless wings and they looked hella dry when they came out. It looked like it had sat for a while too cause the sauce was congealed. When she bit into it, she was working at it. Great. My sticks come out, looks fine and are hot. Marinara came with it, I asked the waitress who brought it out if she could bring me ranch since that's what I ordered. She said ok.  I sit. And wait.  I observe her come and go bringing food out to other people. I catch her eye, wave and mouth ranch. Nothing. Ok.  So now I am sitting and waiting again. Jasmin, the girl who took my order is no where to be found. Another waitress behind the bar who didn't help me comes from wherever she was and I ask her for ranch. She goes and brings it. Great.  I look across the way and 3 dudes are looking frustrated cause they have been there for about as long as I have but they haven't even ordered yet! I catch one dudes eye and we roll our eyes at the same time cause...we just know.  So I finish eating. Just want my bill. Jasmin is a busy bee walking around talking, finally took the 3 guys' order, more chit chat. Finally comes over, tell her I want the bill. She brings food out, makes a champagne drink for the off the clock loud co worker, cashes someone else out, and looks at me and I can tell she forgot to get my bill. Brings me my bill, I am already ready with my card but she turns so quick that I am again waiting for her because she decides to make a drink for the server who just got off work. Apparently, this is a regular thing. And he states very clearly that she was paying attention to the wrong people and she needs to hurry up with his drink. Um, customers vs you?? OK.  She takes my card, I sign it and left her the most minimum amount of cash tip I could. And I didn't even WANT to do that. I didn't even care if she and her friends talk about me cause I WILL NOT be back.  If there is any stereotype that holds true of my people, it is at this place and that PISSES me off! No sense of urgency, having conversation when work clearly needs to be done, an I don't care attitude...It is social time here for staff and customers are not priority and it is not what I remember Fridays to be. Quality is nonexistent in staff and service. The 1 is solely for the cheese sticks and because I have to put something. Someone mentioned ghetto in another review and they are right. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. And I hate that I have to say that about my own folk. *sigh*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=60
Liz B.,"Tampa, FL",0,59,19,3.0,5/29/2015,"Went here for my brother-in-law's birthday dinner.  We had a party of 12, so we were divided into two round tables, side-by-side.  The kids sat at one table and adults at another.  I ordered the Smoke Stacked burger and Strawberry Lemonade, both were delicious!  The burger was tender and juicy, so I have no complaints about the food.   The only complaint I DO have is regarding customer service.   Since we were divided into two tables, we had two waitresses.   One waitress took care of the adult table and the other served the kid table.   Our waitress was great, she was super friendly, made sure we always had drink refills, and ensured we were satisfied with everything.   The kids waitress was the complete opposite.   She didn't offer refills on the kids drinks and rarely came back to the table.  Then when it was time to pay the bills, she gave my husband the bill for our kids and walked away.  She took so long to come back that my husband gave the money to our waitress to cash us out.  This apparently made the other waitress very upset, which she expressed in front of all of us.  Then my husband is handing her the tip for the kids table (which was 23%) and she takes it from him without even so much as a thank you and walks away with an attitude!   I wish I would have gotten her name, or mentioned the incident to the manager on our way out.  Some people just shouldn't work in customer service!

After waiting in the first spot at the front door for about 20 minutes, we were seated. The waiter arrived after 15 minutes, took drink and food order. We both ordered the burger and fries and 2 soft drinks. The food arrived about 25 minutes later (the drinks came in abut 15) minutes and served by the very unfriendly waitress. I had to send my burger back as it was served very cold. It was brought back to me in about 15 minutes. It seems they just microwaved the burger. It was dry and tasteless. The bun was greasy and gross. I did not eat my meal but still paid for it. And to add insult to injury, when I asked for a refill of my gingerale I was told that there are no free refill :(  Well thanks for the half cup of pop and a glass full of ice.

J H.,"Detroit, MI",0,1,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Our block club, as a last minute decision decided to go to TGIF for our annual luncheon. I mean you can't go wrong with TGIF right? Wrong!  They were short staffed, which was boisterously announced by another patron, and subsequently the mumbles from the waitstaff confirmed this fact.  From the time we walked in the door until the time of our departure, it was downhill. I won't go into the details, because several members from our group will probably fill in those blanks, but I wanted to add the following:  I think more patience and consideration may have been displayed by our group, had the hostess, manager, or waitress etc., informed us (apologetically) that they were understaffed, that there may be a delay as a result, allowing our group to decide to stay or consider an alternative place to dine. That IMHO would have been the considerate thing to do. While I realize most don't want to turn business away, sometimes that's exactly what ends of happening anyway when service is compromised due to absences, etc.  Customers for the most part can deal with a little irregularity if they are leveled with and their experience is typically very favorable.  However, because such courtesy wasn't extended, it has resulted in this bad review, which by the looks of it (based on other reviews), seems to be par-for-the course with this particular location.  Ultimately, something was taken off the bill after a clearly exasperated supervisor, decided that she would shut the complainer up and return to disappointing other customers; who would most likely receive the same 1-star service we received.  More times than not, the overall disposition of employees and energy of the  place is a reflection of the one in charge.

Alcoholic drinks were great and 25mins later we received our appetizer. During the wait a couple set next to us and ordered our same thing after our recommendation. And my husband told the server that he has back issues and could we move to the two booths that were open. She replied NO because your order is at this table as she abruptly walks off.... no water. Back hurting my husband replied maybe our appetizers will come fast and at the same time so we can just eat and leave.. Still no water.

No dice. 20mins at this point I had enough! I spoke to another manager and OH our server I didn't get her name until the receipt. Worse. I told the new manager I'm so unhappy and I'm still hungry.

So we informed one of the waitresses that we wanted to sit at the bar so we can take advantage of the prices. She responded ""ok"". Once the bartender realized that we were now at the bar, she ignored us for a few minutes and proceeded to help these 3 girls that was there earlier but left out to go smoke. After she took their second drink orders, she comes over to us and asked us ""what is the problem""?. I was immediately confused on the question as I didn't think I was looking like I had a problem so I responded ""There is no problem. We're ready to order"". She then said ""but why did you guys come sit at the bar? I sat yall at a booth because I figured yall wanted a booth"". Usually when I go to a restaurant they ask if we want to sit in the bar area, table or booth. After we expressed to her that we wanted the Happy Hour specials, she told us that we could have stayed in our seats and still got the special and after she informed us, she basically told us to go back to our booths so that's what we did. Then I was irritated. Our original waitress came back and reiterated that someone had misinformed us about bar seating. By that time we had been there for over 35 mins with no water nor the drink order that we put in 20 mins prior. We watched the bartender joke around, sip on her strawberry lemonade, wipe of the counter but never made our drinks. Finally after 45 mins and all we had was water that we we decided to leave. Our waitress saw us getting up to leave and she never came to ask what's the problem nor during our wait she never came to apologize for the long wait. As we were leaving the bartender came from the back and said with an attitude, ""y'all drinks has been sitting at the end of the bar"". That was clearly a lie because we were sitting right next to the bar and no drinks were there. Remind you, we got there at 1:00 and left at 1:45 and all we had was water that came at 1:35. The bartender, nor any of the waitresses seemed to care. Unless you know someone there, you will guarantee to have a horrible experience here. This is obviously where they place the ""almost rejected"" employees. Please choose another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dearborn?start=40

Shelley H.,"Saline, MI",5,11,,2.0,8/9/2015,"This place looks a little rough from the outside. The landscaping looks pretty sad. The inside is not much better. The booth we sat in was dirty and the walls next to us were filthy. They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in quite a while, with fingerprints and gunk smeared all over them. Lots of crud between our booth and the wall too. After noticing this I looked around the rest of the restaurant and saw the floor was pretty dirty too. It looked like it hadn't been swept or mopped in at least a few days. There were fruit flys buzzing around us as soon as there was food on the table. They stuck around during our entire meal and were quite annoying. I would not come back here because of the uncleanliness.  Service was slow. We came in around noon on a Sunday and the restaurant was sparsely filled.  Our waitress took a while to get to our table but she was nice. She brought us waters while we waited for the drinks we ordered. The bartender took an unreasonable amount of time making our flavored lemonade drinks. We ordered an appetizer that was brought out fairly quickly. Our entrees were served a while after and were delivered hot.

When I asked to see a manager I was told ""not a problem"". I hate that saying!! The manager finally showed up and looked at the steak and wasn't happy.  I told her I didn't want another and that that steak should have never have been cooked. She pressured me into another steak..a strip steak. It was ok but took forever to get. By the time it showed up my wife had finished her meal by 15 minutes. Guess what.. I got a big 20% off my bill.

He responded to our awkward silence with ""I'm just playin', but she'll take real good care of you...""  We just sat there, exceptionally confused as to what just happened.  But what made the whole thing weirder was that the ""so-and-so"" who came made some comment about our previous waiter being a ""troublemaker"" but there were also sarcastic undertones in that statement as well.

We ordered the same appetizer chicken flatbread without onions and entrees of the 6oz steak. I ordered mine medium rare and she ordered hers medium. Our flatbreads arrived with onions. I waited 2-3 mins looking for our waitress to correct the problem, never saw her so I ate mine and my daughter ate the chicken off hers. Our waitress stopped by a few minutes later to drop off a stack of napkins at which time I asked for silverware, since I ate my flat bread with my hands and thought I may look a little ridiculous picking up a steak and eating it with my hands. My empty plate was sitting there but she chose not to take it. A few minutes later our entrees arrived, in which I was asked to hold my empty flatbread plate while she set my entree plate down. My steak was slightly fatty but my daughters was very fatty and just about as red as mine even though it was suppose to be medium (slight pink, right?). When she came back to check she obviously saw we had an issue and we told her it wasn't done enough so she asked if we would like a new one. We said yes. She then came back with an order of free on the house BBQ wings so my daughter would have something to eat while waiting for her steak. I appreciate the effort too bad she's not a big fan of BBQ so she ate a few to hold her over. Her second steak was much better. We skipped dessert but have some leftover chicken wings and flatbread we get to take home where someone may eat it.
