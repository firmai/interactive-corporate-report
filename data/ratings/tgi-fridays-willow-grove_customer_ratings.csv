36,Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708.0,3.0,2012-03-31,"I really should have read the reviews or at the very least listened when our waiter warned us when we wanted food without seasoning that he couldn't make any promises since he wasn't sure the people in the kitchen wouldn't deviate from the way they want to make things. I really thought he was joking; it turns out he wasn't. The green bean fries (one of my guilty pleasures) was about the only thing that came out right. Our water came about 5 minutes after when our waiter realized we'd been waiting about 30 min for it. My shrimp came out marinated with tons of seasoning instead of plain and grilled like I asked and my friends meat came out cooked wrong. (The waitress/server who brought it actually asked my friend to cut it to make sure it was cooked all the way! Who does that?) At the point our correctly prepared and cooked entrees came out, we asked for dessert to go; simple enough, no? Nope, managed to screw that up too. I had a hankering that they would probably screw that up as well, so I checked while our waiter went to grab the check. His was right, mine was a giant Oreo cookie rather than a cheesecake. The manager was also at our table multiple times throughout the experience and really didn't offer much in the way of making the experience better. (Pretty much just let us know the food was pre-marinated and we were SOL for that particular dish) Our waiter was comical, but I don't go out to TGI's for comedy. For food, avoid like the plague. I'm actually half surprised I didn't get food poisoning with all the corruption I'm sure is taking place back in the kitchen area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=40,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002,1.7720000000000002
43,Amanda H.,"Lansdale, PA",7,52,2.0,1.0,2013-02-19,"I used to really like coming to Fridays for a quick bite when I didn't feel like cooking. Last night, we went there for a late dinner because I worked until 9:30. It wasn't very busy, probably about 5 checks at the bar, and two or three tables.  First we ordered drinks. My bf wanted the ""bee sting"", some new drink they have, but, they only had frozen honey, so they couldn't make it. I'm not sure why you would freeze honey, since it doesn't go bad.....actually I didn't even know you could freeze honey, but okay. So he got the Grey Goose Cooler, which was EXTREMELY sour and had about 5 lime wedges shoved into it. I ordered the skinny blackberry margarita, which was also extremely sour, and had so many blackberries muddled into the bottom it was almost impossible to drink through a straw.  We ordered our food, me the Grilled Salmon and Langistino lobster with mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley, my bf the $5 cheeseburger from the late night menu. We also wanted the soft pretzels for an app, but they were apparently out, and had been since Happy Hour, which had been almost 4.5 hours prior.....so after about 20-25 minutes of sitting and waiting for the food, the bartender comes out to tell me they are also out of mashed potatoes. I replaced them with French fries. The food finally comes out, and boy was it bad. First, and this is just a pet peeve of mine, there was no ketchup in the bottle near us, and No other bottles of ketchup around the bar, so the bartender had to walk to the kitchen to get us ketchup. My salmon and ""lobster"" was a total joke, with there being no visible lobster in the sauce, just gigantic mushrooms. The vegetable medley was zucchini (not quite a medley) and so overlooked it was soft and soggy, basically in edible. To top it off, the entire plate was so salty it was almost impossible to eat. I've never had salty salmon before, and i dont recommend it. If it hadn't been almost 11:30, and I didn't want to just go home, I would have definitely complained. My boyfriends meal was also so salty he couldn't even eat his French fries.  (Sidenote: if I had wanted to complain, it probably would have been almost impossible, since the manager was too busy chatting up two guys sitting down the bar from us, making sure their drinks were filled and the got their food and that they didn't have any dirty plates in front of them. This was the entire time we were there, she didnt leave them.) So in conclusion, we aren't going back. If I want to go to a chain, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area, (thinking specifically of Applebees and Ruby Tuesdays, always have good experiences here) that have better service, don't run out of food, don't over salt their food to the point of in edibilty, and don't make you pay $20 for a meal with lobster that has no lobster. There are also plenty more restaurants that have healthy options, since Fridays basically has none (those right portion right price options are a joke, still more then half your days points if you are on weight watchers) and even if you try to have something healthy-ish, they pour a cup of salt on it, cause nothing can be healthy at Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=40,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

40,Laney B.,"Willow Grove, PA",47,12,1.0,1.0,2013-04-15,"We eat here often and by we I mean a party no smaller than 7 normally. The food has steadily been getting worse and the service had never been very good. Tonight it was down right horrible!!! I would not come back nor would I recommend this restaurant, I can't even say with new management I would recommend it. I know I will never go back, at least to this particular restaurant. Every Saturday night we go out to dinner, this week we had trouble finding a place to accommodate our large party without an hour or more wait. This was the only good thing about this Friday's on Saturday night. Without calling out the waitress, I'll save that for the letter I send to corporate, it was the absolute worst experience I have ever had.  It didn't start out so bad, we were seated right away (we called ahead), the waitress came over and took drink orders and handed out menus, explained the insert, then said she would be right back with the drinks.  She comes back about 5 minutes later, walks up to one in our party and THEN asks see an ID because he ordered a beer. She should have asked when he placed the order not after she went to the bar and placed the order. Okay, so mistake, we'll let it go it can happen but it wasn't that busy so hmmm... We got our drinks, she says I'll be back and leaves again. What? When she comes back she takes the appetizer order then says okay I'll put this in and be back. Why? She should have asked if we were ready to order dinner, not assume we were not and leave yet again. By this time we had been here about a half hour. Way to long to not have our order taken. We place our order, I was last in the line, no biggie - you would think. She brings out the plates and napkins for appetizers, there are 8 of us, she brings 4 napkins. REALLY??!!!! We then had to ask someone else for silverware because apparently she thinks we were to eat with our fingers.  Appetizers come out, not very hot - not complaining, we're hungry. Plates get cleared, then 4 dinners come out. Again, REALLY! The food should all come out at once, not separately. Then 2 more come out, then 1 more comes out. My sister asks for mayo, I ask for yellow mustard. The waitress comes back with the mustard but not the mayo, and I'm still sitting with no food. She finally realizes I don't have my dinner and she says let  me go check on it. Next thing I know, she says ""my bad, I didn't put the order in"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Meanwhile, I walked up to find a manager, explained to him what happened so far, he doesn't apologize just says let me check on your food...still no mayo.  My burger comes out finally, it's a hockey puck - totally burnt. I say something again, he puts in another order. I look at my sister and say if it doesn't come out right I'm leaving, she could find me in the mall. It's the wrong burger!! What the hell?? I'm done at this point, not even wanting to eat, someone said just eat it, nope -didn't order it don't want it. My brother in law gets up, tells the manager that it's the wrong burger, I get up & walk out. I could not possibly have taken any more. I'm not sure what was worse, the waitress obviously not being trainer properly or the manager not reacting to the situation. At least he didn't defend her, that's happened to me before. I can't say I will never eat at a Friday's again because I really do like the place, I will not go back to this one again or at least not within the next year. We're running out of places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=40,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

First, the hostess was really goofy and she sat everyone right on top of each other (the place was not even crowded). So, a party of 9 people are right on top of my mother and I...awesome.  I ordered the spinach dip and it was awful. I could have gone to Giant, bought the TGIF frozen brand , microwaved it and it would have been better. Burgers were decent but we asked for a side of Ranch and mayo and our waitress forgot (of course - she was spaced out the whole time).  10 min after waiting, I go up to the kitchen, ask a manager for the sides, he nodded and then nothing came for another 10 min.

Both the food we ordered and the free appetizers we were promised were unsatisfactory. We even had to chase down our server for utensils and napkins.

My wife didn't receive her appetizer till the main course came ( about 45 minutes after the order was placed). By the time everyone got their food we had to leave ( total time in the restaurant was over an hour and a half). When leaving because of being in a rush I had left my glasses there when I called twenty minutes later they could find them and told me to call back. Called back following day and was on hold for about ten minutes before I talked to a manager. When I did he told me he had not seen them but would personally walk the restaurant and look then give me a call back. Four hours later and I'm still waiting. I usually don't bother my self with bad reviews. But this needed to be said. AVOID this restaurant if you can, for the price to service ratio it's a rip off.

Kudos to management for having great people at the door.  I did not get names but the greeter and hostess were excellent.  Good start to the evening. What made our night was our ""waitress"", who was more of a friend than just a person that takes orders.  Morgan made us feel at ease from the moment we sat down, and did a great job all the way around. Our upgraded review is for the people that work there, and the excellence in service that is rarely seen at a Place like TGI.  Morgan was over the top in the way of service and the rest of the staff added to the excellent time there tonight.

They really need to clean house from the Manger down to  house cleaning. They need a lot of training. The hostess had to help clean off the tables.  they didn't know what tables was clean and available you had to walk around and look for your own table at the high top table. Is better than walking around double checking to see if it was a table all the tables with someone finally got up. And the table was dirty they didn't have a lot of high tables. And when you came into the restaurant no one was there to greet you and it wasn't that crowded and then when they finally came out of the kitchen. The Hostess  said it was going to be a five minute wait then a10 minute wait and then you We finally got seated. Then we got seated the hostess said that one side is Large then the other side and it might be  tight. She was talking about the seats to the table. But if she knew that it was like that why the hell would you sit us there. Then we get a waitress that was rude she seemed like she was tired worn out had a bad day and the Manger should've sent her home. She took our order which was water and then came back put them on the table. And didn't come back to our table for about  5 to 10 minutes then she took the couple order that came in behind us first and was ready to order. So me and my husband was just sitting there talking until she came back. Then I asked her about the rewards card and she was getting smart about the question. That I was asking her. Do we get tortilla chips and salsa. The she left again and We never give her our oder. She came back and said are you ready now and I said excuse me. And I told her that We been ready when you brought the water and you walked away. Because we was looking at menu while We was waiting to be seated. I told her well it seems like you don't want to work today and you don't want a tip so we need to gave our to some else. So we got up and ask for the Manger so We talked to him and he wanted to give us another table and We both said no thanks and went to Chili's down the road and had a good dinner and everyone was FRIENDLY .

Last night however was the absolute worst.  The staff seemed to be covering for some MAJOR problems.  We asked if something was wrong.  I could handle the truth but never got to what was happening back there.  Never have I sat down as part of a foursome where beers were ordered and not received for well over 15mins. Beers.  And one had to be comped because it was flat and disgusting.  It was not the beers fault it was a Bud Light.  It was bad regardless.  We were told when the bartender, I guess from the service bar, finally STARTED on our DRINKS.   Now as for the food.  Four burgers Classic, Cheddar Bacon, JD, and something else.  Never have I in restaurant history received UPDATES on when different burgers were ready, which is disappointing to know because then you know what is ready is just hangin under a heat lamp or something.  And ever the kitchen manager came out to speak to us with an update on burgers!!! wow.  And there seemed to a problem with the Garlic Parm Potato Wedges, which is nothing but the same crap out of a bottle they put on the shitty crust at Dominos. I know. Tables were not bussed.  No bussers on a Sunday night? Updates every five to ten minutes on Fridays Regular Menu items with no subs?  Insanity. One of us used the men's room at a certain time and said there was flooding in there. Of the four of us, two actually said Good Luck Folks to a few parties waiting to be seated at the front door on the way out.

First we were not greeted by the host. He simply asked how many and then proceeded to communicate with hand and head gestures.  He seated us and we then waited over ten minutes for a server to greet us.  The server was inattentive and unanimated, she did nothing to cover her obvious disdain for her job. We then waited another ten mins before drinks appeared.  My childs meal and our app appeared in a timely manner, but our meals (two salads and another app) took another forty mins to come out. During the meal no one checked on us or came to refill drinks.  My child had long since lost her patience for sitting and yet the server took another fifteen mins to appear with the check. We watched as other tables were also treated in this manner, with no staff in sight to tend to anyone's needs. As someone who has waited tables I was very disappointed with the lack of any sort of friendly service and the utter failure that was this meal.  Half our party had to leave before the food was even at the table because of the length of time we waited.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and I question how they even remain in business.  I will also be sending this review to corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=20,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

Now if this wasn't bad enough..... They sat my party at a table which was clearly set up for a party of ten and then we had to move. We had to ask for crayons for the kids. If I am paying 8 bucks for mozz sticks, 11 for a burger and you have the balls to charge me an extra dollar (on top of that 6 dollar kids meal) for my kids apple juice, I expect your establishment to be clean as the very least. I will not return, as the appearance of this place is probably very indicative of their kitchen and it's management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48
3,Jessica L.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,62,90.0,1.0,2017-04-04,"Came here at 7:30 with my boyfriend for dinner. Our server, Jared, gave the best service we ever had in the shitty situation we were put in. We waited 45 minutes for our appetizer and he apologized to us for the wait and even joked around with us. The appetizers were so not worth it for $13-14. We got the Friday's combo and when the appetizer came out, the food was somewhat warm but the plate was more heated than the actual food. I ate one of the potato skins and dipped it in the sauce and a label came off. I apparently ate the other half of the label and now I will have a piece of this place with me until I get to the bathroom. The main entrees we had were a well done 10oz plain steak with mashed potatoes and fries and cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. When the entrees came on the table, they were super freaking hot! Like they microwaved the food before serving. The 10oz steak had sweet seasoning and was super dry and my pasta was super bland and oily. THE FOOD HERE IS VERY PRICY FOR THEIR MEDIOCRE FOOD AND SERVICE. Overall, we are not coming back ever again but shout out to our server, Jared, you are the real mvp and I hope you find a better place to work than that disgusting restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48
17,Trisha A.,"Telford, PA",27,1,,1.0,2017-04-23,"I went here last night with two friends at the location in the willow grove mall. I wasn't that hungry but I wanted to drink with my friends who were ordering expensive meals and I was just going to get a salad. (My one friend got the steak and apps and my other friend got, drinks, apps and a burger). Well I got to the table and asked my waitress (a young African American lady with curly hair in a pony tail and large hoop earrings) for a 11 dollar drink and a water. She comes back with my drink and forgets my water. No big deal. I asked her again ""can I have a water?"" and she said ""sure."" Then, she comes back with my friends apps and forgets my water again. Once again, no big deal, it was kind of busy, but not over whelming. So I asked again for just a water an she assures me, she will get it.  Keep in mind, I was right next to the drink station, not even ten feet away. She comes back and clears my friends plates and asks my friend if he wants another drink. No water for me. At this point, I'm done. I go up to the bartenders and get my water there. The rest of the night it seemed like she was ignoring me, but kept addressing my friends. Four times I asked for just a single water and was insanely thirsty. Another server came to drop off entrees and I asked her for a water again and she came right back with it! Seriously you can't get water?! I used to be a server, so I brushed off the 3 times I asked you and you didn't get me it, but seriously, but then you ignored me. I was polite the whole time. My friend was paying for me so we left 3 dollars on a 81 dollar tab. Not sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove,1.44,1.44,1.44,,1.44
58,Patrick E.,"Glenside, PA",3,4,,2.0,2017-04-28,"Went here with some friends on the night of April 28th 2017. There was 5 people in our party. It didn't look that crowded and I saw empty tables around. I'm thinking great we'll be seated right away.. Nope.. they took my friend's phone number so they can text us when the food is ready. A half hour goes by and I go to the front desk to ask how much longer for our party. She said ""oh your up next"" we're just looking for a table. Again more empty tables were around by this point. Finally after 45 minutes we get the text that our table is ready. She seats us in the back in a booth where the whole section was almost entirely empty. Why it took so long just to give us a table is beyond me. Then it took another 20 minutes for us to be served. However the waiter (I couldn't remember his name) but he was like 7 foot tall. He was very good and friendly and the food was good & came out quick. Although I don't know why he would ask ""why don't you just put the tip on the card? I think he was mad we left him a tip in change but hey currency is currency. I probably will not be returning after how long this took. Their seating program is completely screwed up.

She placed us at a booth that was super dirty underneath. I wouldn't noticed until my son kicked a cup underneath the table. I used my flash light and it was liquid everywhere. I asked to switch booth n that was done quickly. However, no one cleaned up the mess even though I stated what was the issue was. They didn't clean up and served the next guest that same dirty table. Service was super slow. Took 10 mins for a server to show up when I asked someone if a server can come to take our order. Took 49 mins food to come and it wasn't a busy Sunday either.

Had to use bathroom.  That was appalling floor so sticky my shoes were getting stuck. The toilets gross, femine products visible n used. Zero toilet paper. I didn't use the bathroom..Just left.

0,Ilene E.,"Philadelphia, PA",57,447,560.0,4.0,2017-09-21,I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place had a decent amount of people dining.  But it was so dark here as if they were save electricity. The server brought us water and we ordered.  I was reading the past reviews about service being really slow and I was nervous but I think our food came within 20-30 minutes so it was ok.  Our server checked on us throughout the meal and when we asked for the check and paid. Everything went smoothly and we begin shopping afterwards. I think it really depends on what time you are dining here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
1,Janelle B.,"Glenside, PA",119,74,41.0,1.0,2017-10-12,"If I could leave this place 0 stars, I would. I've never seen service this awful in my entire life, and all for crappy chain restaurant food. My friends and I stopped here on Cinco de Mayo, unwillingly, as most of the Mexican restaurants in the area had over an hour wait and we were hungry. We thought it would be a pretty quiet and quick place to grab a bite to eat and a margarita, but boy were we wrong. We ended up having to wait over 30 minutes to even get a table. Once we were seated it took an additional 30 minutes for someone to take our order. (We might as well have just sucked it up with the hour wait for a better restaurant, ugh!) We all ordered appetizers so that we could quick eat and get out of there, as it was so loud we could barely even hear one another. When our waiter brought out our food, 3 of the 4 things we ordered were completely wrong. It then took us another 20 minutes to track down our waiter to let him know of the mistake, taking another 20 minutes for him to bring out the correct items.  We were then charged for the mistaken items and had to argue to only get 2 items taken off the bill. Absurd. A quick stop for a bite to eat ending up taking almost 4 hours! The entire experience was absolutely horrible. I don't think I'll ever go to a TGI Fridays again.  Definitely do not stop at this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
