Felice C.,"Morton Grove, IL",363,157,499,4.0,12/9/2017,"It's always a good time at the Cheesecake Factory. They have good service and their food is always delicious and consistent. This is one of the places where you get one thing that's your favorite, and you never stray from it--despite their huge menu.  I always get the Chicken Bellagio--which come with basil spaghetti, chicken, arugula, and prosciutto. And for dessert, I always get the tiramisu cheesecake. Definitely solid options and never disappoint me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg
Angel S.,"Lake Forest, IL",0,23,10,1.0,1/1/2018,"New Years, I understand, it's a Holiday but for me to get my meal and my husbands took an hour. Yes, one hour.  Our server we thought was our helper was then transferred to our ""original server"" whom was on break at that time, our server never came to ask us how our food was.  Meal: Sausage and Shrimp Pasta It was extremely hot to the touch where the noodle sauce looked dry as if it was under a heat lamp for a long time and the portion was INCREDIBLY SMALL. I tried to ""fluff"" it up with a fork with no prevail.  My husband got the ""lunch"" portion as I got the glutinous dinner portion and it was the exact same size or less then his. I wanted to humanely and kindly complain about the portion size since my meal was approximately $20 with crust sauce but the server never refilled our drinks or asked how our meal was.  First bad experience at Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg
Ann Y.,"Arlington Heights, IL",178,351,13,1.0,12/13/2017,"I am not sure what is going on with service tonight, but I am quite frustrated with both here and Coopers Hawk.  I decided to stop by and get cheesecake for myself and my husband, I arrive and it is not busy. I look at the cheesecake and step to the side to order. Meanwhile not a single person on the staff acknowledged me. I wait and wait and wait and finally someone said can I help you. I gave my order to which they said I needed to go the other side to order and wait even more. Finally I ordered and was told to wait at the other side. I wait and wait and wait. Finally I am told my order was waiting on the other side. I expressed my frustration to which they shrugged. I ask for a manager who not only talked down to me cause I was looking at my phone (to see how long It was taking) and was very demeaning in his voice to apologize. I don't get what has happened to service, but one thing I learned is that I am done with chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg
Karen K.,"Carol Stream, IL",63,115,255,4.0,11/28/2017,"On Black Friday, at the Woodfield Mall, my sister and I were all shopped-out and famished!  Thankfully The Cheesecake Factory is at the mall, and have a huge menu which would more than suit our nom-needs! I ordered the Tex-Mex eggrolls as a ""light"" meal.  They were super greasy (there was so much oil in the bottom of the bowl, that I could cook a whole dinner in it!), but also super delicious! My sister is ""eating clean,"" for 6 months, in order to heal her gut, and so she ordered a veggie omelet, no cheese, with a side of potatoes (per request, not cooked in butter).  The omelet was dry only because she couldn't order any cheese.  It wasn't TCF's fault.  But she did say the veggies were tasty!  The potatoes also had a unique seasoning to them and she raved about them.   Of course, I couldn't leave a Cheesecake Factory without getting a slice (and regretfully eating it in front of my poor sister...).  The salted caramel slice was pretty good, but I actually like my homemade samoa cheesecake better (which I still had a half of left at home from Thanksgiving!). I will be back for a different slice next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg
Ruchi S.,"Champaign, IL",31,154,402,4.0,9/3/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory a lot of times and have always enjoyed my meal.  I loved my booth at this location, it felt so romantic. I ordered crab bites, fried mac and cheese, angel hair pasta with shrimps and tomato & mozzarella flat bread. I loved the fried mac and cheese with marinara. The garlicky sauce was so good. Crab bites were little under seasoned but still tasted good. Pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was yum but shrimps were little overcoooked :(. Flatbread tasted good and did not need any sauce. Overall, a great experience as usual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg

I thought we would have to wait as the restaurant seemed super busy but we were seated right away.  Our waiter was very friendly and he stopped by often to the check on us. To eat, I had the chicken taquitos and my husband had the orange chicken. Both plates were excellent. We split the Strawberry cheesecake for dessert. I typically have more of a chocolate flavored cheesecake and I was so pleasantly surprised to have the strawberry as my favorite.  It was so simple but delicious.  I will order it again when I come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg

Jason P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",667,727,208,4.0,8/22/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is the kind of place you go to once or twice a year.  I say that because any more than that and you get sick of it pretty quick. At one time I was going more often, but then stopped for years because I got sick of it.  The menu is huge, so yes you do have a lot to pick from.  You could probably go there once a week for a year and get something different each time. It is a big chain restaurant, so going often it feels very generic.  I'm giving 4 stars because it is a fun place with good food, but it's not the best place around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg

Alyssa P.,"Toronto, Canada",84,131,128,4.0,7/19/2017,"I finally dined here with my family while they were visiting to see what the cheesecake factory has to offer, besides cheesecake. So upon being seated I was blown away with how many things they offer on their menu.   First of all our server was amazing, I wish I could have remembered her name. She provided great service and some laughs. We all really liked the honey wheat table bread. Warm and fresh with a great flavour. I tried their Nashville hot chicken nuggets which aren't a regular menu offering. We all really enjoyed these, great sauce and flavour. I got the Fresh Country Salad from their skinnylicious menu and would get it again. The rest of my family all got sandwiches with a salad. They all enjoyed the Cuban, the Pit Beef Dip, and the Southwest Chicken. Their caesar salad was pretty good too! They love their cheesecake so we took a few to go.

Rachel W.,"Elgin, IL",112,180,52,3.0,7/26/2017,"I usually try to avoid chain restaurants because I would rather eat some place more local ish. My husband and I picked to have lunch here with his grandparents because they are picky. Cheesecake Factory offers a huge option for everyone. We were seated in a booth for 6 even though there were 4 of us. This was nice because we could spread out.  Our server came and got our drink order. I appreciate that he could tell we were chatting quite a bit and was very polite about it. He took our orders. I ordered a salad that I wanted out before my food. The salad was good, I always get it when I come here, but no one ever cleared the plate. Even when the main food came no one took the salad plate. After a while 2 of the 4 plates were brought out. It was over 5 minutes before mine and my husbands grandma's food came out. The manager (I assume) stopped by after about 3-5 minutes when we asked where the other 2 meals were he said that the chef couldn't send out the missing omelette because it didn't look good enough to be sent out....AKA it wasn't done right. We appreciated that but at the same time we could have been notified sooner and also there was no reason why my shrimp tacos were brought out late.  Other than that little hiccup it was just like any other Cheesecake Factory visit. Good, but nothing to write home about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg

Arvin H.,"Addison, IL",199,68,377,3.0,12/29/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a very popular destination for many people.  I get why that is.  It's consist and the food is good, and they have amazing cheesecake.  To me though it's a glorified chain restaurant.   Don't get me wrong, I like the Cheesecake Factory as much the next guy, but the truth of the matter is from my numerous visits.  The food is good, but the menu is a little sporadic and they try to do too much.  They have everything on their menu, and I think that's what make them a good restaurant and nothing above that.  I like that they provide variety, but it's hard to perfect one thing when you have another hundred things that need to be focused on to if you catch where I'm going this this.   There are things though that I do recommend.  The cheesecake is obvious.  The traditional cheesecake with strawberries is my go to.  You can't beat the classic, but if you need a change in pace.  I also enjoyed the tiramisu cheesecake.   Other than the cheesecake the only memorable dish I had was the fried mac and cheese balls.  Yea... that's right the fried mac and cheese balls.  Of course everything deep fried can make anything better, that definitely holds true here.  The execution of this dish is what makes it.  The thicker batter allows for a great crunch to hold up to the creaminess of the mac cheese inside, and to have the mac and cheese balls on a bed of a sweet tomato sauce, really completes this appetizer.  It's surprisingly well balanced and just honest to goodness happy fat kid food. Cheesecake Factory has great cheesecake and has an expansive menu, however for the price and food experience, the are a lot of other options that can surpass the Cheesecake Cake.  But if you want consistency, comfortability (in regards to flavor and food), and lot of (safe) options, I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg

And of course we never leave without some cheesecake :) but im writing this review bc my friends and I were overwhelmed by the workers and manager there.  My friend got very ill during dinner and I had to call 911. The paramedics came and took her to the hospital. My two friends and I were going to pay for her portion of the bill but our waitress informed us that the manager took care of her entire bill. We offered again to pay and they refused that it was already taken care of. We were in shock that they did that for her . The manager took our friends and my name and number down so they could report the incident but also they called her the next day to ask her how she was doing and sent her a gift card. AMAZING !!!! I cant even say how awesome that was of them bc they didnt have to do any of that but they did it bc they wanted to. I cant even put to words how kind hearted the employees are at the Cheesecake Factory . If i could give them 20 stars I would .

Our waiters switched after us getting there and our second waitress was awful. She was inattentive, and hardly ever came by our table since we were seated all the way in the back. WE DIDNT GET TO LEAVE UNTIL MIDNIGHT! Because she took so long getting back to us with the bill, we thought she forgot about us!

Andrea H.,"Palatine, IL",150,87,69,4.0,11/6/2015,"Went here tonight for yet another lovely girls dinner with my friends. This is the second time we've chosen The Cheesecake Factory as our meeting spot and we were once again not disappointed. We had first gone to the one in Oakbrook but our experience here wasn't too much different.  I've been to this location a few times and there's always been a wait. This time it was about 55 min and they told us it would be 40. Now I totally understand that you can't force people to get up and leave but it was a long wait and it was already 7pm so we were hungry! I wish the bar area was bigger so we could have a drink or they had that new technology where they could text us that our table was ready so we didn't have to wait on the buzzer. (We couldn't shop while we waited because the range wasn't far enough) Anyway! Aside with my annoyance with the wait everything else was great! Our waiter Gareth, I believe was his name? Was awesome and he had a cool accent which my friend loved and he was very patient with my weird food requests which I'm sure are annoying so thank you! He also went on break during our dinner so we had a fill in waitress for our table and she was very nice as well so we got lucky! We had the Simosas to start and both my friends got the BLTs which were huge and I had the Mac and Cheese burger. My beef patty was a little more cooked than I wanted but still totally edible and not worth the fuss of sending it back. Their sweet potato fries are my favorite! Good dinner and very friendly service. The only reason they're getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm a brat and don't like waiting that long, we got there at 6:45 and didn't leave till 9:30, I wish they took reservations because we knew 3 days ahead of time we'd go there but otherwise everything was awesome.

Dinah T.,"Mount Prospect, IL",228,305,4058,5.0,3/14/2016,"After all these years, the Cheesecake Factory is still one of my favorites chain restaurants.  Place still gets packed and waiting area looks like we're a bunch to sardines, especially the weekend. They still have a pager system, wish they had a cellphone text system so you can walk around the mall but you can estimate how long your wait will be so time it well. Once we got seated, we were treated by our server quickly very nice and attentive lady. She made sure our drinks were filled and our food is served in a timely manner. Even when the dessert was running behind she apologized to us but letting us know it's coming out soon. We were given sweet honey oat and sour loaf bread at the table.  Both were good too tempting to ask for more. Hubby got a beer and I got a drink cocktail, a pineapple Moscow mule. You can definitely taste the pineapple flavors with a half sliced fresh pineapple. It came with a very tall glass. I would get this again it's flavors are very tropical and sweet. For my dish, I ordered the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta very good this is my favorite dish on the menu. Plenty of pasta some are veggie pasta and others are plain topped with a spicy jambalaya sauce chopped onions and bell peppers with plum tomatoes with a couple of whole shrimp and chunks of chicken breast.  Hubby got his usual the shepherds pie dish. Well seasoned chunks of ground beef with a mixture of finely shredded Zucchini, carrot sticks and peas topped with the creamy mashed potatoes. Very hearty. Their portions here are plenty that you can take home unless you're very hungry then eat up my friend enjoy! Both dishes came to us piping hot, excellent! To end a great meal, we both shared a huge slice of dolche de leche cheesecake! It has a lighter texture than your typical cheesecake. It also came with two huge whip cream tops and with chopped nuts and toffee. Wow delish! Again,overall a great experience and the flavors and the amount of food is still the same as I remembered coming here last time.

Wow we always eat in the mall location and usually the food is good and the portions are big. Today it seemed like our pieces of cake were so small that there wasn't enough to share like we always do. Now the cheesecake is good but those 2 slices are about $17 so they really need to bring back the bigger portions. The dinners were good and we enjoyed our meal but the cheesecake slices really bummed us out.

Working in the fine dining industry, I've become very understanding when it comes to getting bad service. Sometimes, the server truly can't keep up and I can tell when that's the case. I get it.  However, the service we got here tonight was just unacceptable. We were seated in a crowded area in the bar side where it was incredibly noisy; we couldn't hear each other even at a shouting level. 5 minutes go by and our server comes over (doesn't even introduce himself) and takes our drink order. He comes back with drinks about 5 minutes later and walks away without saying a word. Another 5 minutes goes by and he brings bread (which was awful by the way. Hard, cold bread and frozen butter? Not a great mix. Not his fault though) and leaves before we can tell him we would like an appetizer. We sat there in silence for 20 minutes and there was still no sign of our server. Again, we still haven't been able to order ANYTHING besides our drinks after being here for 40 minutes now.

Cara M.,"Chicago, IL",53,57,83,5.0,5/16/2017,"The service was excellent, as usual. I ordered the veggie burger, which was really good. The first great thing about it was that it was SO filling. I can usually eat a good amount, but almost couldn't finish the sandwich and couldn't eat more than 5 fries afterwards. The flavor tasted a little garlic-y, in a good way. The texture was mostly of brown rice, so it didn't stick together so well. The cheese on top was perfect, it kind of help the burger together and made it deliciously cheesy. All in all, I really liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=20

Euniishh L.,"Skokie, IL",274,73,67,4.0,8/28/2016,"It's crazy how busy this place is on a Saturday. Waited for around 20 minutes before my friends and I were seated, but that was fine because we weren't in any rush.  We ordered the avocado roll and the spinach dip for our appetizers and the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. The pasta was amazing! I've never had it before and I couldn't believe I'm finding out about this pasta now! I've been here many times in the past, but never ordered this before. If you don't like tomato sauce then you should try this out. The sauce was very creamy and went well with the spaghetti and shrimp. The spinach dip was a miss for me. I usually love it, but this one was too dry and we barely finished half. The avocado rolls was pretty good. It was very rich and filling.  The customer service was good. Our waitress kept asking us if we needed anything and refilled our waters.

The food isn't going to be mind blowingly good but it isn't going to be bad either. It's a safe chain restaurant where you're going to get decent food at a reasonable price point. Had the Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger (medium rare) and the Pasta with Shrimps & Sausages which were both fine. The sauce that accompanied the pasta was a particular stand out although they were a bit stingy with the amount of shrimps given.

The chicken madeira was bland and EXPENSIVE. The mashed potatoes were not good. They charge a lot but the food isn't good. The only thing they do right is the desserts, PERIOD. My main purpose for this review is to address what I believe is a serious issue. For some reason this is the only restaurant chain that places the flatware directly on the surface of the  table instead of wrapping it up in the napkin. How can this be SANITARY? I find it disturbing. I don't care if the table has been wiped. What's in that water, where has that rag been??? I'm done.

They had my cheesecakes ready within 5 minutes and it was a smooth pickup. I went with the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple and Oreo Dream Extreme. The peanut butter one with the Butterfingers pieces stole the show, but they were both excellent. Huge pieces of Oreo and Butterfinger embedded inside the cheesecake layer. Ridiculously good crumble toppings. I will go here again for sure, but it's probably best to split 1 piece between 2 people because it is a lot of sugar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=20
Liliana M.,"Houston, TX",107,20,9,4.0,7/27/2017,"Very impressive restaurant! My boyfriend and I walked in on a busy Saturday afternoon and within 10 minutes we were seated. So what I absolutely loved about this place was that they have two entire menus. One of the menus is called the ""Skinnylicious Menu"" and it is a menu with appetizers, salads, pastas, fish, meat, entrees, etc that range from  100 to 800 calories. If you are someone who likes to eat healthy or are on a diet and are trying to limit your calorie intake then I would suggest this place!  I ordered from the Skinnylicious menu a turkey and avocado sandwich with a salad as my side. The sandwich was well toasted and they filled it up with a ton of turkey and avocado. Now the only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because even though the sandwich was good it was not anything that tasted different or better from what I could have made at home. My boyfriend did not order from the Skinnylicious menu, but the regular menu (which also displays how many calories every single dish has!). He ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna and it was pretty much 4 medium pieces of tuna on top of some white rice! The tuna was very tasty and fresh! Loved this dish! This dish is a 5 for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=20
Bob R.,"Palatine, IL",223,623,715,2.0,10/15/2016,"I had not been to the Cheesecake Factory in Woodfield Mall for many years. My daughter was visiting and we have very different tastes for food sometimes. This place has a large and diverse menu, so we decided to go. At 6pm on a Wednesday night it was crowded, but we were seated pretty quickly. The service was good. The food was okay - not particularly memorable. I had a burger, which was ordered medium-rare but served well-done. The meat was good, though. The fries, however, were terrible. They tasted like the oil had not been changed recently. I am really not a big eater but I generally finish what I was served. This time, I left the fries after eating only a few. I struggled with how to rate my experience. I like going to Cheesecake Factories that I have been to in other cities. I have good experiences there. This particular one I have had run-ins with before when I did complain about the food. One time, the general manager even stepped in saying I was being unreasonable - I have a food allergy and when they disregarded that and served the meal wrong, he belittled it, refused to replace it and charged us anyway. In fairness, that was a long time ago. But, that is why I had not been back.

Jenny K.,"Hanover Park, IL",40,194,767,4.0,3/25/2017,"I'm still unsure why this place isn't rated higher. It's the Cheesecake Factory! A classic restaurant that I went to growing up. The food has always been wonderful, and the cheesecakes are divine. My husband and I went last night, and we had a short 20min wait for a table, which isn't bad. We ordered the Vietnamese Summer Rolls as an appetizer. The rolls were delicious, and my favorite sauce was the peanut. My husband loved the spicy chili sauce. The vegetables were fresh and tasty, my only complaint was the skin they used to wrap the roll was overly sticky and thin, so everything kept falling out. For the entree, I ordered the Miso Salmon with Brown Rice. The fish was cooked nicely and the flavors were good. I wish there were more snow peas, but I just ordered a side of asparagus to get my veggie fix. My husband ordered a Shrimp Scampi, and he liked it more than than the Shrimp with Angel Hair that he used  to get. He said the Scampi had stronger flavors. Just a note the Scampi is breaded and lightly fried, so if you don't want fried shrimp get the Shrimp with Angel Hair. There was so much food we didn't even get a chance to order cheesecake. Maybe next time! By the way, I also got a Frozen Iced Mango, and it was awesome. You can really taste the mango purée. I used to order this 15 years ago, and they used a Collins glass, but now it's in a tumbler. Definitely more bang for your buck!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=20
Richard R.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",8,36,7,2.0,6/24/2017,"This place is a perfect example of why I can't stand chain restaurants it's almost like they don't care about service or the food quality because people are going to come here regardless just because of the name. So they don't take reservations which I get because people flock here like cattle so need for them to bother with them.  When we finally did get seated and 30 minutes later got to order our drinks and an appetizer, seemed like a little much, I mean I get that you're busy but 30 minutes?  Really? The crab artichoke appetizer we got was a big plate of mayo, couldn't even taste the crab or artichoke. Fast forward 45 minutes we got another round of drinks and finally got to place our entree order...again I mean come on the service is laughable at this point. So the turkey burger I ordered was like a little frown dried out hockey puck and was all around terrible, the good news was the the other four people in my party seemed ok with their food so I guess that works. We took five slices of cheesecake home and I will say, they were delicious, the names fits for sure they know their way around cheesecake. If you ask me, this place sucks, go eat somewhere else and come here to pick up a piece of cheesecake to take home for dessert.

The Mac and cheese balls were $12 which is a little expensive for the quantity that you receive but by far the best form of Mac and cheese I have tried. The Kobe burger was delicious but nothing that was jaw dropping but it is the quality that you pay for. The only aspect that could have improved was the customer service.

He then stated 2 more shrimps will be coming out shortly. By the time I received my unflavored shrimp my pasta was cold.

Vivian S.,"Roselle, IL",94,19,14,5.0,9/3/2017,"Every time I've come here I've never had a bad experience. This place is truly cash money for being a chain restaurant!!! Parking here can be done only through the Woodfield Mall parking lot which can either really suck or it can not suck as much if you can get good parking. I do love that the restaurant has allocated parking spots for patrons who order takeout which is also awesome! I do recommend that they offer some sort of valet parking option but I guess that option isn't as easy at this location (Oakbrook location has valet).  The inside of this restaurant is beautiful like all the other Cheesecake Factory locations. This location,to me, is just a little smaller though. On a busy night it's hard to find a place to sit down while waiting for a table but they do have a coat closet which is cool . I usually call ahead of time to hold a table if I have a large party.  Okay all the waitstaff here are very good at what they do! This place is usually busy and these fellas still get everything about your order correct! Drinks are brought out fast and the food also arrives pretty quickly. I like that they always check in on the tables frequently but not too much ya know? The bust boys turn over tables quickly too! Overall, you can expect a cash money experience here!  The menu here is huge! The drink selection too is fantastic! I usually stick to a water with lemon  and the lemons are cut like a wedge which I love because other restaurants usually just give you a sad little slice:( the strawberry lemonade is pretty dank here though so give that a try! All of the portions from the appetizers to the main dishes are very big! I love the avocado rolls here with that delicious cilantro dipping sauce... the dynamite shrimp is also great! If you're watching calories, then look no further because they also got a skinny menu (the shrimp  scampi is phenomenal). When I'm feeling extra, I usually opt in for the steak Diane/ salmon combo with asparagus and mashed potatoes with no mushrooms  (ew). This is frick'n awesome dish!!  The salmon melts in your mouth with herbal flavor and the light sauce leaves your palette satisfied! The steak is cooked to perfection all the time and is already cut up! This place also does brunch on Sunday but I haven't tried it yet. I will update this review once I've tried the brunch. Now for the real reason why everyone comes to the Factory of Cheesecake: the cheesecake! My husband usually just orders a whole 8 inch (I think) cake to take home and order it once you get there because it takes 2 hours to thaw out. The banana cream cheesecake is amazing and a personal favorite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=40

They were extremely busy for a Thursday night but we got seated right away and our server came to the table immediately. She was very knowledgeable about the menu which helped cause its extensive and I have a hard time deciding to begin with The calamari appetizer was good but the star of appetizers has to be the Thai chicken lettuce wraps! They come with 3 different sauces, the chicken was cooked perfectly and they actually use the correct lettuce for wraps unlike some other restaurants which shall remain nameless. The rest of the food was good as well. Usually I'd be ready for my cheesecake at the end of it all but I decided to try something different and went for their chocolate truffle layer cake.....AMAZING!!!!!!!

Then was visibly upset that we did not order drinks from the bar. This was when I realized he was only interested in padding the bill to receive a bigger tip. By this time we just wanted to order food eat and get out of there. I did not mention that this was my birthday dinner. We ordered food waiter never checked on us until we were clearly finished and we asked for to go boxes which waiter said you wanna box them yourself in which I very adamantly responded yes due to I was afraid he would spit in our food while boxing it up. We were never disrespectful to waiter, I strongly do not believe in treating people wrong but I am a VERY generous tipper I always leave at least 20% this night NO this waiter got a 1% tip which I honestly believe was too much.

Sandra Y.,"Chicago, IL",292,146,349,1.0,11/17/2016,"Went here for dessert the other day with 3 other people and I feel like the server didn't like us too much because we were just ordering desserts. We felt very ignored for most of the night. Overall service was very very slow. First, she messed up our order and brought us the wrong cheesecake. I give it to her for remembering 3 out of the 4 that we ordered. It might've helped if she wrote it down. It took forever to get 4 slices of cheesecake. Seriously should not take like half an hr for that... Then, we couldn't even tell her about her mistake because she never came to our table. It was impossible to get her attention. It was not that busy when we were there either. So finally, we get her attention and she takes it away (brand new, we didn't touch it). We got the correct order like 15 minutes later... and it was nasty. It was too sweet and none of us liked it, but we didn't want to send it back. Idk why people I'm with don't like sending food back, but anyway! 4 slices for $40 is basically a rip off, but we still like to go here because sometimes it's good and we were really craving cheesecake.   I find that at this cheesecake factory, the service is always bad. Whether you spend $40 or $200... I get it that they're really busy sometimes, but you don't wanna feel like you're inconveniencing them by being there and that's how I've felt twice so far. And this is spaced out like a year apart. Idk I'll prob still go here when I crave cheesecake, but even those are a hit or miss. Some good, some not good at all. The same goes for the food. Maybe I'll just carry out my cheesecake next time or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=40

No privacy - waitress always looking down on us. Next we ordered 4 dinners and the first one - they didn't have - a ruben sandwich. Then after re-ordering they brought 3 dinners to the table - waited about 10 minutes for my dinner to come while everyone elses got cold. The tacos were sooooo tiny and they put all the ingredients on them that I asked not to have put on. Aggravating. When I went to restroom they were out of service - wont go into detail. But the best is when I spoke with the manager on my way out - blonde lady her only response was ""sorry about that."" Really - wont be back - I didn't ask for anything - already paid the bill - But what a lousy response. Obviously our business did not matter.

T ..,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,10/13/2017,"We visited this location in Sept 2017.  I ordered the pork chop (which I've had at the Old Orchard location and it was delicious).  The pork chop was overcooked, dry and flavorless.  The mashed potato and broccoli were good.  My sister ordered the lettuce Mexican tacos.  Part way through her meal, she thought there may be cabbage on the tacos (she is allergic to cabbage - think food poisoning symptoms).  The menu did not show cabbage was in this meal.  She asked the waitress (Jessica) and she confirmed with the kitchen it was cabbage.  She apologized and asked if she wanted to order a different meal.    Jessica was nice, asked if my sister was ok and was apologetic.  Our meal was ruined, as we had to leave immediately; not to mention the illness to come for my sister.  We asked to speak to the manager. Enter Chad Grimes, store manager.  (Who, by the way, should secure a job that does not require him to interact with customers.)  He walks up to the table and asks - ""Are we the table with the tacos and is allergic to cabbage?"".  Without a response, he continues to state with ZERO sincerity or even the slightest inflection in his voice, ""I'm sorry.""  Obviously he was not sorry, but I would've expected him to pretend a bit more effectively.  A conversation recap - we expressed concern that cabbage was not listed in the menu nor would one expect cabbage on a Mexican taco.   We acknowledged that it's certainly not his fault, but perhaps this should be addressed with the appropriate person at the corporate level.   His responses with profound apathy - not all ingredients are listed, this has been discussed with corporate and there's nothing he can do.  Of course he would not charge us for the taco dish that made my sister ill.  We paid for my bland pork chop and left.  It's too bad that we'll never go to this restaurant again.  Had Chad been able to demonstrate that he cared at least a little bit and offered something of value to maintain the customer relationship - we may have given the place another try.  Poor Chad, stuck in a job that requires him to work with people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=60

The wait for our food was about half an hour, but that's pretty average considering this is a nicer restaurant. Our server was absolutely outstanding. Didn't catch her name, but she answered all our questions, smiled almost nonstop, and helped us decide on dessert. I ordered a Cuban sandwich (also a first for me) and it was really good! The only negative thing I have to say about that though is the bread was literally painful to bite into because it was toasted, thick, and super crunchy. I wouldn't hesitate to order the Cuban again if the bread was softer. And omg those fries!!! Golden, delicious, fresh, and perfect with the ketchup they provided. I ordered the Black Out cake for dessert and took it home. Now that I've dug into it as a midnight snack, omg... Chocolate lover's heaven. It does contain nuts on the outer part though so beware if you have a nut allergy. The entire visit for 4 people: 4 waters, 1 Coke, 1 lemonade, 4 entrees, and 4 slices of cheesecake/regular cake = $100+ tab. Overall, I was really impressed.

Jennifer M.,"Schaumburg, IL",140,349,292,4.0,12/27/2014,"Going out to dinner on Christmas Eve is my family's tradition. After three consecutive years of bad experiences at Claim Jumper on Rt 59, we can't seem to settle on one place. We've been on the lookout but   we continue to change locations year after year. That's not necessarily a bad thing because we get to try new or less frequented restaurants as a family, annually. The kids are still young (one of them still believes in Santa) so choosing a restaurant that accomodates kids' taste in food without compromising the quality of service and ambiance that fits my sister and her husband's budget can be challenging. Fortunately, the perimeter that covers our area for good eats is the Northwest Suburbs. It's a huge territory with a cornicopia of restaurants. It continues to develop and grow to rival with Chicago's best. When we finally settled on The Cheesecake Factory, I was relieved and actually happy with the choice we made. My usual complaint that the menu has too much variety of dishes, accomodated all eight of us to find something satisfying: Angel hair pasta plates, red meat with a side, a turkey burger with a side,  seafood with a side and 2 baskets of warm loaves of white and brown bread served with room temperature butter. Some of us started with an adult beverage, I had a Coke straight up with ice. The kids had iced water.  After finishing our entrees, no one says they don't have room for dessert to share. I mean, the name of this restaurant is a dessert. Who disagrees with me that it would make sense to eat at a place famous for their dessert and skip ordering one? The way they have the cheesecakes displayed, just off to the side of the hostess' stand and set up like a retail shop with its own staff and cashiers, it's easy to just stop in, place an order for a slice and go! By the way, thank you for listening to my first review. Of course I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake and I do have something to say:  upgrading the 3 measely strawberries to 3 ginormous ones was a fabulous idea.

The host took us to a table all the way in the back. My sisters and I just looked at each other bc we all thought it was weird that he passed so many empty tables to sit us all the way at the last table in the rear of the restaurant.  A waitress came and greeted us, and brought a round of waters back. 10mins go by and she hasn't returned yet. We see her coming back our way and we get her attention, we ask if we can order our appetizers now and she says ""I'm not your waiter"" we say ............""ok well can you get the person who'll be our waiter??? We've been waiting for like 15mins and no one has came to our table."" She says it was a change in shifts so she'll go get our new waiter. 15mins later our new waitress is at our table.  Now we're just ready to eat so we order our entrées. My sister has her son with us so she asks if his food can be brought out as soon as it's done. I order a falafel salad. She orders a fried chicken sandwich and everyone else has some sort of pasta. My nephew's food arrives 20mins later along with his mothers food. 10mins later a pasta plate comes out. 15mins later my mom & little sisters dish comes out.

Well of course it didn't I don't have it, I do t even have a plate in front of me. It's now been about 50mins and she finally comes back with my salad, which I'm sure was just sitting back there waiting to get picked up. I took one bite of the falafel and it was not even crispy. I asked for it to be sent back and for management.  The manger comes to our table and is actually the same person who sat us all the way in the back and gives me attitude. I told him about the long wait and how we've been there for like 2hrs and everyone's food coming out one at a time and me receiving a salad an hour later that should've  taken no time to come out.

I got the steak Diane, my friend got a burger, and my spouse got some type of garlic bread with ricotta, pesto, and basil on top. The Thai lettuce wraps and phenomenal. The free bread is crusty and warm. Best of all, the cheesecake! It's pricey for everyone to get their own, but each slice is big and filling. I've never had a bad one there. The servers tend to be on the attentive side. The biggest downsides are the slowness of seating during peak hours and the price. The food is always delicious.

Jeannette B.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,2,1.0,8/1/2016,"I ordered the Mexican Tortilla Salad with Chicken. The chicken lacked flavor, was fatty, gristle, and there were barely any pieces. When I brought it up to my waiter (Amy W), she apologized but pretty much laughed it off and then commented, with a rude attitude, ""next time tell me so I can get you a better piece of chicken"". I would've appreciated it if she actually had a caring attitude, exhibited a concern, or had taken the price of the chicken off the bill. She didn't care, which makes the company look bad when it comes to customer service. I wasn't looking for anything free or complementary. Her attitude is what upset me and made me write this review.

Claire M.,"Forest Park, IL",145,353,392,3.0,11/21/2014,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in quite a long time.  I'm not particularly sure why, though I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake (unless it's ALL chocolate) but I realize cheesecake is only one part of their menu, which as we all know, is rather extensive.  I don't DISLIKE it, but after I stopped eating meat 6 and a half years ago, I was unable to eat what I usually would order which was the delicious ""crusted chicken romano"" or something like that. I found myself out in Schaumburg for some reason last weekend and when lunchtime approached, somehow this was the selected venue.  I must have been in an especially agreeable mood.  While it appeared to be freakishly crowded in there, the wait for two was only 10 minutes, but I think we waited 15 or 20, still no big deal.     I think the last time I was at one of these places (the one in Oak Brook maybe?) I ordered one of those flatbreads and it was good, but I don't find flatbreads to be too terribly exciting.  This time, I went for the veggie burger.  I've had many a veggie burger in my day, some good, some bad, some downright awful.  It's always a gamble for me.  This one, as described in the menu, sounded rather intriguing.  This is what it said:  A Delicious ""Burger"" Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Couscous, Mushrooms, Black Beans & Onion. Served on a Toasted Bun with Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, Pickles & Mayo. Served with a Green Salad.  I ordered it without mayo (because I think it's disgusting) and got it with fontina cheese.   And whatever that brown bread is they serve, it's delicious, I love it, and I eat too much of it.  But if there's any treat in eating there, it's that.   Our waiter kept apologizing to us for the wait.  It didn't feel like things were taking a long time, but I think we were there for about two hours.  I didn't care, but I asked for ketchup to douse my burger in and never got it so I ended up consuming it without.  It was still delicious, but would've been even better with ketchup. We got cheesecake to go (so full).  Hershey's chocolate for me, pumpkin for the other one.   I'm slightly more frugal now, so I always wince a little when the check comes because it's always more than I think it should be - and we didn't order appetizers or drinks.   The only somewhat annoying thing that happened was that there were sooooooooooo many screaming babies and children there at the same time we were.  So I was hearing surround sound of crying pretty much the entire time.  The kid at the table behind us kept throwing things which of course ended up right at our table.  Was it bitchy of me to not pick anything up for the parents?  Well, I didn't.  It wouldn't have been sanitary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=100

My favorite has always been the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta so I just had to order it. I was so looking forward to it, it's one of my absolute favorite pasta dishes. Sadly, either they have changed the recipe at all locations or perhaps this location cooks it differently. The portion was smaller than I remember it and the cajun spices had more of a heat flavor than cajun flavor. I'd be perfectly happy with Tony Cachere's spice mix than what they use now. The service was good but very slow. Towards the end we just wanted to get out and pay but had to wait 10 minutes to get a container for the leftovers.

I've been here twice now but can't say that the food or service is anything I'd return often for, but the selection is vast and I'll give the benefit of the doubt that I just haven't found my dish yet.  I tried the avocado eggroll appetizer after seeing it pop up in many reviews. It tasted like guacamole stuffed inside a thick eggroll wrapper, not bad but not great. Tip: go easy with the dipping sauce! It is overwhelmingly sweet. I ordered the chicken stuffed tortillas, an enchilada type dish made with melted cheese and tomatillo sauce over four corn tortillas stuffed with (not very)spicy chicken. Also just mediocre. The pasta dishes seem to be consistently good. My friend ordered miso salmon which is served over rice. The salmon was good but the bed of rice it was served over was horribly undercooked. It says it comes with snow peas but it looked like the few snow peas that came with the dish was just for garnish.  I hope to update this review after I've tried more of their desserts, though!

While the service has been decent, and the food has been decent -- I never leave there aching to go back. The cheesecake IS pretty darn good, but $7-$8 for one slice isn't something I'm going to do often. And it'd probably be the only reason for me to actually choose Cheesecake Factory over another eating establishment. This last visit, I was there with a friend and we ordered from their Sunday brunch menu (we were there at 11am). I got the Bruleed French Toast which was just ..... weird. I didn't care for it at all and left most of it on my plate. Thank goodness I ordered bacon ($3 additional) with it, or I would have been starving. It was just not for my palate. The inside of the french toast was still ""wet"" and ""gooey"", where it made me think it wasn't cooked all the way thru. I don't think that was the case -- it's just how they make it. I'll stick with regular good old fashioned french toast --- if it ain't broke, don't fix it!!!! Sometimes I think places go too far with trying to put their own spin or ""froo-frooing"" something up when they really don't have to. It also took a long time for our meals to come up. For french toast (and my friend had eggs, pancakes, bacon, hashbrowns and toast) and other breakfast items, we did sit there, but since I was also visiting with my friend, it wasn't a HUGE deal. However, they DID recognize this, and apologized. We had a manager stop by the table to also apologize and offered us comp dessert. YES, please!!!! (Like I said, the cheesecake is probably the only reason to really go as I've yet to find a dish that I just MUST go there for) It was nice that they recognized their fault, and even though we didn't complain, they stepped up and nipped it right away. Still, after tip, I still forked over $21 for french toast I didn't eat, a glass of lemonade and a complimentary slice of cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=120

He thought it was good, but not anything he would go rushing back here for. My standard order that I always get here the Chicken and Biscuits had a strong onion flavor to it. I don't mind onions, but it was a tad bit too much.  For dessert we ordered the banana cream cheesecake served with fresh banana slices and whipped cream. DELICIOUS!!!

The place itself is fairly dimly lit, with your typical Cheesecake Factory decor.  Mirrors make the place seem more spacious, and there are a number of TVs in the bar area.  When it is busy it gets pretty noisy. Our typical appetizer when we go with friends is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (three tamale cakes in one appetizer), which is really good.  This last time I was here I also ordered the Meat Loaf, not what I would typically order at Cheesecake, but I hadn't had it in a while and was craving something comforting.  And what isn't more comforting than meat loaf and mashed potatoes? The meat loaf came on what seemed like a platter, which is consistent with Cheesecake Factory's large portions.  It included a large scoop of mashed potatoes, four slabs of meat loaf, and a corn succotash.  Definitely enough for two meals (unless you are really hungry).  While cheesecake tends to be a little pricey, they do make up with it with their portion sizes. For dessert I ordered the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake which, for someone like me who can't decide what to order most of the time, fits the bill perfectly: ""Layers of moist chocolate cake, chewy brownie, toasted coconut-pecan frosting and creamy chocolate chip coconut cheesecake"".  With cake, brownie, and cheesecake all in one, I get a little bit of everything.

And the warm and colorful ambiance is the perfect backdrop to great conversation and food. It wasn't my first time here, it probably was close to the 200th time that I've dined here. It was, however, the first time I've ever ordered a glass of wine. The Pino noir was decadent and only $10.50 for a glass. We shared the corn tamale cakes- which never cease to amaze. The sweet and warm coupled with the cool creaminess of the sour cream and avocado.... Infringes upon perfection. I ordered the jerked pepper shrimp dish, which was super rich, very flavorful and the plantains on the side rounded out the dinner, quite nicely. My friend ordered the chicken Bellagio- which was a generous serving of tender chicken over pasta, with Parmesan cheese and arugula salad on top. Fresh and delicious. Seeing as how we stuffed ourselves on the bread, tamale cakes and giant dinner portions, we didn't have room for dessert. So we reached down to our inner fat kids and ordered three slices to go. Pineapple upside down cheesecake.  Taking two phenomenal deserts and scientifically combining them to create an unbelievable treat sensation... How is this the first time I'm trying it?! I didn't share. In fact- I want another.  From beginning to end, the entire meal was spot on. Way to always be a high scoring restaurant, and a favorite. But seriously, if you go- pick up an extra slice of the pineapple upside down cheesecake for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=140
Catherine P.,"Merrillville, IN",437,492,2281,4.0,11/3/2011,"I'm happy to announce that I am writing an update for TCF.  I know going in that service is hit or miss and something typically is always messed up on our order, but we KEEP COMING BACK!! It's like our very own form of Woodfield crack. Once you go, you'll know what I'm talking about.... Typically, there is a wait. Anywhere from 15 to 90 minutes. Because it's awesome!! Be patient, people. It'll be worth the wait. We have tried to make reservations for large groups that we have gone with to celebrate birthdays and such, however, they do not accept reservations. Kinda stinks because I think they loose business this way. I know I won't go with a group of 10+ people to celebrate my birthday because I don't want to do that to my friends. Their bar is always packed on a Friday or Saturday night, so there really isn't much to do while you wait besides crowd up their lobby, hold up the walls, and shoot the s$%^. Thankfully, they have some booths to sit while you wait if you are lucky enough to grab a seat.  Don't let the small bar/dining area in the front of the restaurant fool you, there is a TON of seating near the kitchen area and in the back of the restaurant.  I don't really think I have ever had anything here that I didn't like (whether or not it required remaking is another story). They use higher quality ingredients considering it's a ""chain"" restaurant. You get what you pay for @Cheesecake.  Most recently, we went in with a gift card I had to use up. A little middle-of-the-week date night with my guy. He dropped me at the door, so I could run in right away and get us a table (common pratice for us when we come to TCF) and hot dog diggity, there was no wait!! Thank you mid-week-ers eating at home tonight, you allowed us to get a table right away. I actually made THEM wait to seat US because I wanted to wait for my fiance to be seated together. Kinda nice for a change. ;) We were greeted by our server, Beth, with bread and butter. God bless her, she must know us. We each ordered our sodas, mine- dt. coke with a water back and Steve's- sprite. Sadly, the syrup must have been out because he said it tasted awful. He switched it up to a Dr. Pepper. Happy as a clam. We started with a ""small plate""; the chicken croquettes. Didn't know what they were going to be but for $5, I was willing to try them out. They were these little fried 'nuggets' almost, with very nice white meat chicken breast pieces inside along with a very creamy cheese.  Don't quite know what kind of cheese it was but it was good! It was nice to try something new. We'll for sure get them again for an app. They were yummy.  I am so boring. I ordered the Chicken Costoletta. My go-to fave! Three pounded out crispy chicken breasts served with mashed potatoes and asparagus spears served over a bed of creamy lemon-y sauce. Love it!!  My fiance was adventurous this time around and opted for the Southeast Asian Caramel Chicken which is crispy battered chunks of chicken in a spicy Vietnamese sauce with green beans, carrot strips and other veggies. He opted for the brown rice which he mentioned after dinner was so bland. Poor guy, he didn't even think to add butter or salt until after he was done eating. Dork!....but I love him. I also noticed that he was picking out mushrooms and putting them on his bread plate throughout his meal. I recall you ordering it without mushrooms, babe? Yeah, I did but I can just pick them out. He's so easy going. Those mushrooms would not have been sitting in front of me very long, ick!! We are not fans but it didn't bother him that much. Just me, the pile of slimy mushrooms were staring me in the face. Gross!!! I'm such a baby. We skipped dessert because, now I know I'm crazy, we are not fans of cheesecake, just fans of The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=140

Kalyn M.,"Chula Vista, CA",45,10,9,5.0,2/20/2015,"After a couple people had told me the only good thing about this place was the cheesecake, I had avoided it for a long time. On a whim last night, I suggested my family and I go here to try it out.  We were almost immediately seated, which was nice considering Woodfield is typically busy, even on week nights. I didn't realize how huge the restaurant was from the outside- holy crap! It's quite dim, which I love, and is fancier than I thought it would be.  I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was fabulous. It's as if he knew exactly how many times to come to the table, the perfect amount of wait time before refilling drinks, etc. The best service I have ever had at a restaurant!  Now onto the food...ugh. Amazing. At first I was a little skeptical due to how huge the menu is and how many different cuisines they offer (Italian, Asian, Mexican, American, etc). I've noticed that when a restaurant has too large of a menu, the food isn't always great. I ordered the avocado egg rolls to start, even though my family thought it was an odd appetizer. We were all surprised at not only how quickly the appetizer came, but how DELICIOUS the egg rolls were. The sauce is to-die-for. The ""black"" bread was great as well and the butter was warm. Seems stupid, but I hate when butter is cold and won't spread on your bread!  I am a veggie burger junkie, and in my opinion, they're very easy to mess up. They're either flavorless and falling apart all over the place or perfect. Let me say, this one was perfect! It did fall apart a bit, but it didn't bother me at all because it was full of flavor. The dipping sauce that comes with it is fantastic too. I got sweet potato fries for the side, which I'm also obsessed with, and they were amazing! Simple, but they complemented the burger very nicely. The proportions are also huge, seems to be a theme here! I think the cheesecake speaks for itself, but my favorites are the Oreo and lemon meringue.  All in all, I plan on going back for my birthday in April. There are so many things I want to try, but the veggie burger was so good that I may just have to stick with that! Highly recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=140
Jen R.,"Hampshire, IL",55,217,306,3.0,9/16/2013,"If I were only rating the cheescake, it would be 5 stars, no question!!! 3 stars for the food (its mediocre & overpriced) 2 stars for the length of the wait 2 stars for the service It's always busy. I've eaten here several times & I'm never overly impressed with the food or service. The pizza is decent. I generally skip the wait, the lack of service, and restaurant experience, and just walk straight to the dessert line, order the most incredible, melt I'm your mouth, make your taste-buds dance, creamy cheesecake. My mouth is now watering. The dulce de leche, banana cream, and vanilla bean, pecan turtle, and red velvet are delish. Skip the Reese's peanut butter one, its much too rich, and not all cheesecakes are created equal. The chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake is my personal fave. It is pretty much the most incredible temptation on the planet & if eating it were sin, I'd repent the rest of my life for a single bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=140
Greg H.,"Hendersonville, TN",6,27,5,1.0,11/8/2014,Food is average at best. Forty plus minute wait isn't worth the food in my opinion.

Fries weren't warm at all (although the plate was very hot...must have sat under the warming light too long) and no flavor at all. The sandwich was so greasy it was stomach churning.

Erinn P.,"Palatine, IL",122,7,1,2.0,3/12/2017,"So my family and I came here to celebrate  my sister getting married. When we first came in the  staff told us it would be an hr wait, since we had no other place in mind we decided to wait the hr. Little did we know that would turn into 1hr and 45 min of waiting not just an hr. That was just the start of this night. Don't get me wrong I understand the places in the mall get busy but this was just a crazy amount of time waisted. We  finally get a seat, at this point we are STARVING there are five of us waiting to chow. We were offered bread at our table and only got ONE basket for five people... after waiting 1hr and 45 min .... that was not enough for all 5 of us. We start looking at our meal options and my cousins opens her menu to a huge slab of butter smashed inbetween her menu, kinda gross not gonna lie. I decided I'd go ask for a new one and hit the bathrooms on my way. Not only was there a line in the bathroom ( understandable) but there was NO TOLIET paper in any of the bathroom stalls but ONE! I then went back up front to let someone know that the bathrooms are empty of toilet paper ( and to be honest they were a mess). After getting back to the table I was asked what I wanted to eat and I also asked for an ice tea that took about 25 min to even arrive after I was told by my waiter he forgot. Well that's not the only thing he forgot ... my meal didn't come out with everyone els food cuz they forgot... or maybe sent it to the wrong table because i saw someone else's food wondering around that night as well. I was pretty upset at this point that even the free crappy side salad didn't help. Best part of the night was that NONE of my food was free even tho it was late and someone els got my food  and I had to then wait even longer to eat after waiting so long to sit down. We all ordered desert and the part that blows my mind after all this crap is that our waiter forgot to add a peace of cheese cake to our tab came over AND GAVE my mom a new bill... no offense but that's super shitty after all the crap we went through that night.... shitty company for not givin me either my cheese cake or meal for free ...

The only downside to this place is that the menu is so diverse, it will take you 30 minutes to decide! My go-to dish is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Just the right amount of sweet and loaded with plenty of chicken and shrimp. As an appetizer, the Buffalo Blasts are a must. The ambience is dark and loud, the service is top notch, food is delicious with large portions, and the wait times can get heavy because of the mall traffic.

I've tried their other food items, but it's been too long...sorry! i'll have to update this at a later time.. Atmosphere: a place for everyone whether it's family, friends, or significant others, but if you don't like dim lit places, this is not the place for you... it's very dark in here!! maybe romantic, but sometimes loud cuz it is crowded.. Service: good, but it also depends on who your waitress/waiter is... Price: reasonable..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=180

Jennifer S.,"Bartlett, IL",361,677,2317,4.0,5/12/2012,"We visit The Cheesecake Factory about four times a year. I used to visit more, but I'm always annoyed at some point during my visit for one of many reasons that I usually have to wait a few months before my next visit. Why the four stars then?  Well, the food is delicious!  Overpriced?  Yes, but delicious!  And if the visit causes enough aggravation, a manager will get involved and usually find a way to try and apologize...usually thru more of the yummy food!   Most recently, my sister and a girlfriend of ours stopped in for a Monday (?) night dinner. No wait. This was a first!  That was a nice start. We were seated by the large birthday party in the back, so it was loud. Well, it's always loud here. In case you haven't caught on yet...you go for the food and not the conversation time with your loved ones.  Butter. It's a precious commodity at The Cheesecake Factory. Seriously, I think it is part of the official TCF training. You do not, under any circumstances, give more than three little foil wrapped butters to any one table at any given time!  They'll give you warm bread 'til the cows come home however.  I have yet to try something here that I didn't like. From the Kobe burger to the shrimp club sandwich to the Cajun chicken littles to the thai chicken pasta. It's all good. Really good. The cheesecake ain't too shabby either. Expensive though. $7 ish for a slice. It's so rich that you can easily share it. Oh, and every slice arrives with fresh whipped cream. If that's not your thing, just ask them to skip the whipped cream.  My suggestion?  Go in with the knowledge of my review behind you and you won't be disappointed. Go ahead...text each other at the table to 'talk', eat your bread...and keep asking for butter, pack up half your meal right away because it's a huge serving and eat dessert. Because you can. And because you now know that you are only going here for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=180

Sarah N.,"Chicago, IL",343,348,315,3.0,3/21/2012,"We decided to have lunch with my boyfriend's family here today.  I'm never really a fan of Cheesecake Factory, I feel it's overpriced food that can be cooked by a mediocre person.  Being that it was an invitation to spend quality time with family, it wasn't hard to say, ""YES"".   The hosts were very friendly as we entered the restaurant, pleasant smiles and courteous greetings.  It's always nice to know that the staff is welcoming.  The restaurant was full so that was a good sign that people actually like coming here especially since there are a lot of other restaurants in the area. After being seated, the first thing that came out of my boyfriend's Aunt's mouth was, ""Ooooh, there is something on my spoon.  I guess I won't be using that.""  My boyfriend and I started inspecting our spoons and he found something green stuck on it, like a dried up green pasta that wasn't washed off.  It made me wonder what their kitchen looked like.  Was it clean?  Is the food cooked in sanitary pots and pans?  What else was dirty?  I would have overlooked that thought if it was just one, but two spoons was one too many.  Luckily, after pointing this out to our server, he immediately took it off our hands and replaced them.  He apologized sincerely. Everyone ordered something different.  I just remember what my boyfriend and I ordered.  He ordered the Chicken Fettuccine and I ordered the Jambalaya Pasta.  He said it had too much salt on it.  We suggested he let the server know but one thing about my boyfriend, he doesn't like to complain.  As for mine, it was very tasty and full of flavor.  The chicken was tender and juicy, the pasta had a good spice to it where I could still taste other seasonings than just a burning tongue, and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  If I had to nitpick at something, it would have to be how the shrimp didn't taste fresh; it was almost tough and chewy.  Also, the dirty spoons were still swirling in my thoughts and wondered if my plate was clean before they placed the food on it.   At the end of the meal, the waiter took our plates and packed it for us except for my boyfriend's mom's salad.  He forgot she wanted it packed and tossed it away.  To save his mistake, he had the kitchen staff make another for her and packed that in a container and apologized.  What makes a great restaurant isn't just the food but that and the service of the staff.  The server gave us his input on what he liked on the menu and his opinions on the food.  When a server can give you a feedback on the food and explain what is in a dish, it means he/she has tasted it and knows his/her restaurant.  I believe it's important because not everyone knows what they want to order. Our overall experience was good.  But, I probably won't go back for another year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=180

Roseanne S.,"Villa Park, IL",97,325,75,4.0,2/8/2012,"Cheesecake factory: you are a diet's worst nightmare. Not that I'm on any kind of diet, but I'm just saying. HUGE FREAKING PORTIONS. I've come here for dinner a couple times, and each time I've had to take food home. I love when they ask if I've saved room for dessert. No, sorry. I don't have a five gallon stomach to hold in all the food you are putting in front of me. This review sounds bad, but it's not. I just have to note the portions first. Aside from the amount of food you get, the food itself is actually pretty good. My boyfriend and I came here and we wisely split our dinner. We ordered an herb chicken breast with mashed potatoes. The plate was so big and there was a lot of food, but we shared and it was enough for both of us. This is the way to go. You save money, and you can finish what is in front of you without taking home food you're never going to touch. Then we had cheesecake. Excuse the acronym, but OMFG. I had the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake (possibly called the Reeces cheesecake) and I totally had a foodgasm. It made me so blissfully happy. I've also had breakfast here and it's really good.The potatoes are nicely done and you get huge pieces of toast (of course) but they use dark wheat toast with grains and everything.

J H.,"Aurora, IL",3,52,75,1.0,7/4/2015,"Bar area is available on first-come basis so chose that over waiting for a table. We saw an empty table and waited for someone to clean it off. Finally, I flagged someone down - turns out it was the waiter. He did clean it off and about 5 min later - the busser wandered into the area.  Server was nice but clearly overwhelmed a he tried to serve 10 tables. This resulted in LONG waits for drinks. And, since we were in the bar area we could see our drinks but we couldn't get our drinks - just got to watch the ice melt as the drinks got watered down. Food was ""ok"" - it wasn't anything I'd run back for. We ordered the lettuce wraps and, frankly, I have had better. Seemed like we had way more wrap ( lettuce) than filling to put in wrap. And once finished, we had the appetizer plate on the table for the entire meal because the busser was not interested in bussing tables and, apparently, the food runners don't take empty plates away.  I ordered a blue cheese flatbread as meal. Topping was ok but flatbread was burnt. Daughter had the kids Mac and cheese - it was kind of dry - not creamy like Mac and cheese should be. Husband had a sandwich which was ok. I think our server tried his best but he had way too many tables so he could not effectively provide great customer service. The busser really didn't proactively look for things to do - he had to be specifically asked to take care of stuff. Other staff members would walk by but didn't help out. In the end, I think there was a lack of teamwork or cohesion in the staff - resulting in a less than satisfactory experience.

My friend at one of the lunch specials (sandwich, salad, and soup) which was so much food, and I went with the Avocado Eggrolls that so many people recommended.

Then we each had a slice of cheesecake- she had some sort of chocolate madness that I would not have been able to eat (wow- so much chocolate), and I tried a new one for me- Key Lime Cheesecake. It was the perfect cheesecake texture and taste- and I loved every bite! I had several eggrolls and half a slice of cheesecake to take home as their portions are abnormally large.

Kate S.,"Schaumburg, IL",6,16,,3.0,11/27/2013,"Let me start by saying looking for the restaurant was like searching for the Ark of the Covenant, except for the whole ""finding it after all"" part. Maybe not exactly like the Ark...basically it's tricky to find. So if anyone else has trouble, it's next to the upper level entrance of Macy's in Woodfield Mall. Not the Streets of Woodfield, but Woodfield Mall itself. I can't fault The Cheesecake Factory for my geographic ineptitude. We called ahead to try and make a reservation for our group of 7, but they don't take reservations during their holiday season. When this actually starts and ends, I don't know. But we were still able to get a table. I asked my server right away about my allergies and what was safe for me (nuts and shellfish, for what it's worth). She was very knowledgeable, and told me the process in the kitchen for patrons with allergies, which I really appreciated. I felt taken care of. It's worth noting that the cheesecake itself isn't prepared in house, and has the standard ""may contain traces of"" warning associated with it. The table ordered a round of cocktails, and all were pretty great. I got the Asian Pear Martini, which contains sake, ""pear""  and ""passion fruit"" (who knows what that actually means, syrup or otherwise), vanilla vodka, and sake. The technical term for this is ""stupid delicious."" But everything we ordered was good - we did the ""pass to the left, try everything"" system. Other drinks included the signature margarita, a strawberry daiquiri, and a red sangria. After some liquid courage, I tackled the menu. It's 20 pages. This isn't an exaggeration - the menu is literally 20 pages long, containing all drinks and c-cakes. But holy selection. I finally settled on the pasta carbonara, which is spaghettini with smoked bacon, green peas, and a garlic-parmesan cream sauce. It was pretty great. Warm, creamy, bacony - it hit the spot on the coldest night ever on the face of this planet. Nothing to write home about, but it was tasty. As far as the cheesecakes, I ordered the tiramisu for myself and the banana cream for my boyfriend because I express feelings through food. The tiramisu was okay. It tasted like a normal, slightly bland cheesecake, without any of the amazing dark flavors of tiramisu. No espresso and a slight dusting of cocoa do not a tiramisu make. Overall it was tasty, but I don't see myself clamoring to go back, especially for the price. But it's fun for a casual night out with some ladyfriends to catch up before you break out the boxed wine. The service was the best part - the staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and gave great suggestions. I wish I caught our server's name so I could give her her proper ups.

Stephen O.,"Memphis, TN",119,58,7,4.0,9/26/2013,"The secret to eating at the Cheesecake Factory is NEVER THINK ABOUT CALORIE COUNTS when eating there. Seriously. As long as you don't 'go there', you will have a superlative experience. We only waited about fifteen minutes and got our table. If you have not been to The Cheesecake Factory, let me illuminate you: you do not get a menu, you get a comprehensive breakdown of a variety of food cultures and genres. It is like War and Peace: The Menu. What I have discovered over the years is that the food is pretty amazing no matter what you get (astonishingly). Our server was somewhat *less* than amazing (pretty terrible actually) but since we had a few dozen pages of menu to read it wasn't so bad. We started out with the Tex Mex Eggrolls. You need these in your life. Spicy chicken, corn, black beans, cheese, with an avacado cream sauce and salsa?  Come ON. Next, I went for a Greek Salad  Unsurprisingly, I got extra dressing. I cannot recommend this greek salad enough. It is probably the best I have had, edging out Mellow Mushroom by a tiny bit. I have to admit I overdid it on the dressing at this place. My friends were both laughing about my greek ""soup"" when my salad was about half gone. That stuff was delicious though! For the record, I did not drink it hahaha. For an entree, my buddy and I both got the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas. It was basically corn tortillas containing spicy chicken and covered with melted cheese and cilantro and just ridiculously awesome. The corn cakes that came with it were almost as good as the tortillas themselves. I want to describe them further but... I cannot... it was just so good. I could not finish it but I wanted to! My roommate got the Baja Chicken Tacos which looked delicious and certainly less gut busting than our dinner. He said they were excellent. For dessert we of course got cheesecake, but I do not think any pictures exist (due to our inhalation of said cheesecake). I do not remember what I had, but it was amazing. We had our last adventure of the day trying to get a server to bring us our check. We were there pretty late and the place was shutting down, I think it probably took 20 minutes or more just to get a check, then 15 more to get it back and leave. If not for that service, this would have been a five star review.  Yes I know the Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but every time I go they knock the food out of the park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=220

Kati L.,"Downers Grove, IL",221,14,22,5.0,12/2/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory has gotten some great things right. First, though they're always crowded (what Cheesecake Factory isn't?) they do a great job setting expectations around wait-time, and then they beat that time.  Every time.  But that's really just putting years of research around perceived wait time to good use.  What made this visit different enough to warrant a review is Misty.   My mother has celiac disease, which has opened up a whole new perspective on service in restaurants.  Since ""gluten-free"" is the diet du jour, it's pretty easy to find GF items called out at most major restaurants.  The Cheesecake Factory is no exception, and has GF versions of many of their most popular dishes. Misty, who was our server for the first half of the meal, took things a step further.  She assured us that she not only placed the GF order, but also that she'd checked in to make certain my mother would be served the right version of her meal.  When she brought bread to the table, she brought my mother a basket of chips and salsa.  That was huge.  My mom's used to sitting patiently while the rest of us knock out a bread basket, and having chips brought with the bread had a big impact.  It showed that Misty understood what gluten free is all about, and how it feels to have a dietary restriction that conflicts with standard restaurant protocol.   This was a big win, and such a small gesture that made my mother feel like part of the table.  Kudos to Misty for taking care of the people, rather than just delivering our orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=220

They gave us a buzzer and told us it would be 20 minutes so we went out into the hall to wait where it was much less crowded.  The wait was just as expected and not too bad.  We had a table in the back and our server came right over once we were seated. The bread we were served was delicious.  I really enjoyed the whole wheat one.  Since we had waited 20 minutes to be seated, we both had the chance to look over the menu so we already knew what we wanted to order. We both ordered a drink also and I think our server might have gotten a bit distracted because there was a little delay in getting those.  Our food came out fairly quickly and my oh my the servings were large.  We had already agreed ahead of time that we were most definitely getting cheesecake, but that didn't stop my boyfriend from putting down his entire meal.  He still ate the cheesecake too.  I still wonder how he stays so skinny.

Anywho... been here a couple of times since my last review and felt that it deserved an update.  It has either been a happy hour event... lunch or dinner with some GFs... the hubby will NOT come back here unless the meal will be free, so I guess that isn't happening anytime soon.  I love their Asian salad during lunch... its a pretty big portion and its delicious, plus the complimentary bread is pretty darn good.  I am also obsessed with the Fried Mac 'N Cheese balls.  I mean, you really can't go wrong with those 4 words, but they make it even better by having them sit in a bead of marinara.   Last time I was here I got the Garlic Noodles, which consisted of, you guessed it, garlic noodles, asparagus, tomatoes and mushrooms.  The portion was HUGE, lasted me three meals... but they definitely skimped on the veggies and this was a $13 dish.  My friends Romano Chicken looked to-die-for and, again, the portion was huge... but she was sick throughout the night.  Granted, we had drinks, appetizer, dinner, and cheesecake, so it could have been too much rich food.  And the cheesecake.... OMG heaven.  We had the Smores' one and we were just both blown away.  I wish I was eating it right now. It is a VERY expensive place, which sometimes drives me nuts cause its a chain in a freaking mall, but you definitely get what you pay for (here and there at least).  If you don't want to spend a ton, share a meal, there will be PLENTY of food for two people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=220

I didn't quite grasp the meaning behind the Egyptian decor (why isn't it a factory that makes cheesecake?), but it was at least pretty. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. Our food came out quickly. I had the Monterey Cheeseburger ($11.95) with sweet potato fries (+$1). Giant burger with avocado, jack cheese, arugula, red onion, and honey mustard mayo. Very good, and cooked to my liking. The sweet potato fries required an extra wait and were unremarkable. Others got the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad ($14.50), which was absolutely massive. It looked like there was literally a whole head of lettuce in that bowl. The original margarita I had was meh. No life in it, pretty watery. I tried the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and found it, like all their cheesecakes seem to be, decadent but much, much too rich.

That being said I had stopped going once I stopped working and needed to eat gluten & dairy free for health reasons. Also living in Elgin going to Schaumburg is not like dining at a local restaurant. In November 2013 my half-brother gave me to two $25 Gift Cards for my Hanukkah Gift. I decided in January to treat my best friend to lunch here for her belated holiday gift and to celebrate my January B-day early because I would be out of town. I checked the online menu and was very impressed with the large Gluten free Menu. I ordered the Gluten Free Fusli pasta with the marinara sauce and it was cooked perfectly and tasted great which is not always the case with Gluten Free pasta, the portion was HUGE and enough for me to take home and have 2 more meals. The only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars and not 5 is because there is no where close to park to the restaurant entrance and Woodfield is always crowded, even in the dead of winter and snowing and extreme cold.

Ashley F.,"Streamwood, IL",19,43,20,1.0,2/17/2014,"I've been to this restaurant a few times and really enjoyed the food and service. I suggested it to a couple of friends coming out from the city, but now I'm sorry I did. I tried to make reservations the day before, but when I stopped in, I was told they don't take reservations on weekend.  I arrived at 1:30 and was told there was a 40 minute wait. The place was a zoo! Worse than the parking lot, which took over 20 minutes to find a spot. Even after out pager was buzzed, we stood around like it was some kind of cattle call.  We finally were seated and waters were put in front of us, but no one introduced themselves as our server for almost an hour! When we finally flagged someone over, the waitor said ""Oh, I just didn't want to interrupt you guys talking."" No, let's be honest- you forgot about us and don't want to admit it. But thanks for lying to our faces instead of living up to your mistake.  We quickly put in an app order. Not once were we asked if we'd like anything else to drink, so we just sipped our water the whole time were were there. The app came pretty quickly, but then our food order wasn't taken until about a half hour after our app was finished.  I wanted to order a chicken salad sandwhich off the skinnylicious menu. I asked to sub the salad for the sweet potato fries. I was told it's the exact same sandwich on the regular menu. I was thinking they used light mayo, etc. Apparently the only thing ""skinny"" about this menu is the side is chosen for you- you get a green salad.  After another long wait, my friends' food was brought out and not mine. They politely waited for mine to come out while theirs got cold. My sandwich came- light my ass! It was SMOTHERED in mayo and the bread had butter oozing out of it. It was disgustng. I couldn't even eat it after all that wait. To top it off, my fries came out when my friends had already finished their meals.  I can't believe I paid over $20 for a disgusting ""meal"" and 2 eggrolls.

Amanda L.,"Arlington Heights, IL",73,126,105,5.0,7/7/2013,"How can you not love The Cheesecake Factory? Especially now that they have a lighter options menu, this is back to being one of my favorite restaurants. And don't let the ""smaller portions, lower calories"" fool you - these are the same generous CF portions you've come to know and love (and sometimes fear). You can even get some of your favorites, just in more reasonable sizes, or with small changes (the chopped salad, for example, has a different, and equally delicious dressing).  And of course...dessert. I've had more cheesecake from CF than I care to admit, but they have all been great (even the sugar free options). I will say that all slices are generous and big enough to share for sure, but if you just can't agree on a flavor with your dining companion, it's not such a tragedy to take home some sweet leftovers! Service is always great here, the atmosphere is nice (active but not too loud)  There is almost always a wait, especially during peak meal hours and Sunday mornings. Sometimes you can find seating in the bar area without a wait, and they serve a full menu. Also - I know they used to do this, not sure if they still do, but they used to have a wonderful happy hour (from 4-6 on weeknights), where you could get smaller versions of the appetizers for a few bucks a piece. My friends and I would meet up and each order two or three things for the same price as an entree.

Here's my justification as to why... 1. It's ridiculously over priced. 2. There's always a wait at this location. Always. 3. The service is never more than, meh. 4. The food is never more than, meh. 5. Their menu is more overwhelming than an accounting textbook.  With that being said, it is what it is. I will admit, their addition of the small plates and SkinnyLicious menu items makes dining there a bit less gluttonous. The food is decent, especially the salads and the small plates. I stick to those. But, the shining star of Cheesecake Factory is, in fact, their cheesecake. I, for one, love their Vanilla Bean, Key Lime, or Pumpkin cheesecakes. They're extremely flavorful and always creamy and decadent. The portions are huge, and being diabetic, I usually have enough cheesecake for a week. And I do love the fact they have a low carb cheesecake. It makes me and my pancreas quite happy.

After eating here recently and getting severely ill from the food, I'm not only disappointed in the restaurant, but also in the way the manager handled the incident. My advice is first- stay away from the seafood entrees. The Bistro Shrimp pasta made me the sickest I've ever been in my life- and resulted in a 4-day stomach virus. When I called the manager to report this, his tone was accusatory and all he offered was a ""small gift certificate"" and a follow-up phone call -- both of which were never received.

Kristi H.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,3,,2.0,1/3/2016,"I so wanted to love my Cheesecake Factory experience tonight but, unfortunately, that was not the case.  After reading the reviews, I had resigned myself to the idea of a long wait; however, we were seated quickly. We arrived at 430 on a Sunday to a packed lobby. But we put our name in and were seated within 15 minutes. So fantastic, right? Wrong. We were seated in a booth directly across from the kitchen entrance. You know the one, every restaurant has one. It's almost an afterthought booth, as if the builder looked at the blueprint, saw an empty space, and decided to stick something there to fill it up. Gah. So noisy with dishes being thrown around that I couldn't hear the conversation of my table mates, and the constant line of servers walking past like soldiers marching in formation was actually stirring up a breeze. By the time the smirking server arrived at our table and proceeded to describe the daily special of salmon something or other and pronounced the word salmon with an audible ""L"", I was ready to move. The hostess came over, found us a fantastic spot far away from the kitchen, and helped us move our drinks and menus. Hooray! But then... We placed our order. Knowing it might be a while on this busy Sunday, we ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes appetizer with no cilantro. Then each of us ordered an entree. The tamale cakes came out covered with cilantro. The server took them back to the kitchen to have them remade. By the time they came back out to the table, we already had our entrees. And no appetizer plates. No biggie, we all ate the appetizer from the serving dish. And, truth be told, the appetizer was the best part of the meal. It would have tasted even better if the dish had been comp'd for our trouble, but it wasn't.  The entrees: kid's pizza, steak Diane, falafel salad, and an order of pot stickers were all just meh. The one alcoholic drink I ordered was rather weak and I was never offered a second. Which I wasn't sure if I should be mad or glad about once I saw the $10.25 price tag for what was essentially a vodka lemonade. The others had soft drinks that were never refilled. And the list goes on... So, overall, a 2 star experience for short wait time and food that was edible. The kitchen mistakes, meal timing, inattentive wait staff, and food quality for value makes up for the other three missed stars. Sorry, Cheesecake Factory, I would have to say that I'll skip a return trip. Oh, and don't bother ordering the key lime cheesecake.  This did not even remotely resemble cheesecake. It was a tall serving of soft key lime pie. Like key lime pudding. Mush. Not good when you are expecting a piece of key lime flavored cheesecake. I would think, out of the whole meal, that The Cheesecake Factory would get the cheesecake right. Sigh.

Acknowledging the exceptional service!  We have been to many restaurants where if the specialty drinks are not made correct, even if we do not drink it they still charge the amount. At times we have paid for drinks we didnt even get to enjoy or have.  Location is fairly big and spread out so it does not appear cramped. However there can be a long wait, we waited about 1 1/2 hour so plan accordingly.  If one person from your group waits at the restaurant, the others can still walk around or shop!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=240
Carrie H.,"Joliet, IL",6,17,11,2.0,10/20/2014,"I normally would give an excellent review of this restaurant but this fluke visit was a disaster. First off our waitress greeted us with her name as soon as we were seated and then disappeared. She didn't ask if we wanted drinks or anything. She came back 15 minutes later and we ordered salads. She forgot our dressing until 20 minutes into the salad. When she came with the dressing and noticing I had already been eating the salad she quickly dodged to the bar area to hide it. After I paid with my card , I noticed my card was charged twice with 2 different amounts. I waited too see if the mistake would drop off my account.  It didn't. So ,I called and was told it was taken care of. It's now been 10 days and nothing.  Very disappointing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=240

I always enjoy going to The Cheesecake Factory whenever I'm at Woodfield; it's just a good time. I was recently there for a lunch date with my BFF. There was a long wait, of course, but since there were only two of us, it was only about a half hour. We ordered a couple drinks, hence the getting ""drunk at The Cheesecake Factory"" part. I ordered J.W.'s Pink Lemonade, which came with Skyy citrus vodka, raspberry liqueur and lemonade. It was delicious! It was sweet and sour and refreshing. Highly recommend.  For an entree, I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club, which had chicken breast, avocado, bacon, tomato, melted Swiss and herb mayonnaise. Really tasty! I would definitely order it again. It also came with plenty of fries served in this cute, metal container. Then of course, we had to order cheesecake. I got the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which of course was amazing. Once you get seated, the service is always really good. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, despite the restaurant being super-busy. We didn't feel rushed and hung out there sipping cocktails for quite a few hours.  Overall, I enjoy eating lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.

Josh M.,"Downers Grove, IL",90,110,73,4.0,3/11/2012,Holy shit there is something wrong with a restaurant that needs to put advertisements in their menu binders. Yah its a binder. There is no lack of choices and fortunately most of them are good. With a happy hour that offers half price apps its hard not to just make a meal out of them. I have tried some of the burgers and pastas but there are a couple of apps or what they call small plates that have me wanting to return. There are the buffalo blasts that are essentially buffalo chicken inside a wonton wrapper and fried. Can't go wrong with that. Another standout are the sweet corn tamale cakes. A little crispy and perfectly creamy in the center. I would order tamales more often if they were like this and not the usual dried up bricks. The most unlikely item that blew me away was the Vietnamese tacos. Soft pork buns with an addictive soy marinade and a ton of pickled veggies to cut through the richness. I would have never expected them at a Cheesecake but im not complaining. Id skip the onion rings and the spinach artichoke dip they are kinda crappy. Get your fix at TGI's if you must. Cheesecake can be pretty expensive so take advantage of the happy hour you will thank me for it and get some extra tacos for lunch the next day they reheat perfectly somehow.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=260

We came here because it is the 100th birthday for Cheesecake and all of their cheesecake was 50% off. Sweet Deal...pun intended. This time around I had the Fish tacos. I was feeling adventurous, because I've never had fish tacos and I'm not all that big on fish. But it was Cod, which I do like, so it was ok...and I mean just ok. McDonalds puts out a better piece of fish.  I did like the avocado and cilantro with tomatoes...I wish there were some pico do gallo or something. Anything to give it some more flavor.  We were kind of in a hurry and left in a rush and ordered cheesecake on our way out. We settled on Dulce something? it was a pretty plain caramel cheesecake. I liked it, but it's not my fav.

Each nacho is covered with cheese and all of the toppings, each one gets it's own jalapeno.  Avocado egg rolls. Pretty bomb. Perfect for a light snack. A little spicy, but if you like avocado I would think you'll like these.  Now for cheesecake, I used to ALWAYS order the Godiva cheesecake. It's super rich, but there are layers of different types of chocolate and it's just amazing. I think this is my ""classy"" option.  More recently I've tried Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple which not only has Reese's but it also has Butterfingers!

Phil S.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",133,250,109,3.0,2/29/2012,"I come to Cheesecake maybe twice a year when we're sick of everything else and we can't decide or disagree on what to eat.  The menu is literally a book and they cover most fatty food groups with an above average elegant touch consistently.   I've tried most of their pastas, sandwiches, specialties and appetizers over the years and have yet to be disappointed.  You may find this weird but I'm not much for sweets so I have only tried their cheesecake a grand total of once and that was dessert someone else had ordered.  They have plenty of seating at every location I've been to and the wait is short even at the busiest times which makes it an even easier decision to make when trying to figure out what to eat. Service at this location is hit or miss but I will say that the last time we went we had the most courteous and reserved waitress I've ever had. I wish I remembered her name.  She guessed what we wanted perfectly before we even ask over and over and delivered with a smile.  She wasn't all jabbery like some are in an attempt to get a big tip.  When I'm trying to eat I really don't care for all the jibber jabber waitstaff can sometimes spew with such practiced fakeness.  All I require is that you're there when I need you and you make an honest attempt to accommodate my requests.

Was seated immediately but day at a half booth, half table that was way too close to our neighbors. We heard everything they said and that heard everything we said. Was a little disappointed and wish I had asked to door somewhere else.. The servers wear all white and they looked a little dirty and sloppy to be honest. In a classy place like that I would expect the servers to look very clean and sharp.  I ordered the habachi steak and it was very good! It was served with mashed potatoes and two deep fried asparagus which were only there for garnish it seemed. I would've preferred a bigger serving of vegetable and not deep fried. My dad got some Jamaican jerk dish with shrimp and chicken. There was not enough meat at all and it wasn't all that great. We both got a slice of cheesecake. They do not offer a complimentary birthday dessert. My dad got a peanut butter, chocolate slice that was way to sweet for him and I believe it only had one tiny layer that was actually cheesecake. Mine was some coconut, chocolate cheesecake that was pretty good. Paid $80 including tip.

I chalked it up to a chain that catered to the tourists stupid-enough to stop there. Then when I was out in Vegas a few years ago, I was the stupid tourist that stopped there, and loved it! Since I didn't have the ability to take leftovers home then, I ordered the 1/2 salad, 1/2 sandwich special. Perfect for a quick, non-filling lunch.  This Cheesecake Factory is attached to Woodfield Mall. Waits during peak eating and Holiday shopping times could be brutal, so stagger your lunches, people! Our wait at 1:30pm was less than 15 minutes. The chicken enchiladas were very good for a chain. The black beans were too ""smoky"", but the cilantro rice was unique and out of this world.

Joe D.,"Wheaton, IL",0,6,,1.0,8/17/2014,"A group of four of us has just spent the day at the horse racing track. We were deciding what to have for dinner and we decided on Cheesecake Factory. Now it's a Saturday and as expected there was a wait so we walked around the mall to kill some time. An hour later we get sat. As you can imagine we were all fairly hungry and looking forward to a hearty dinner. Our server greets our table(Kim) and she seems less than excited to be working. We ordered drinks and two appetizers right away. She does inform us that the kitchen is backed up and food was coming out slowly.  Fifteen minutes later one of our two appetizers hits the table. Kim thought it was better to have one than none which was strange but we dealt with it. We place out entree order and continue to eat our now delivered second appetizer.  This is where the wheels begin to fall off. Our entrees begin to get delivered but not all at once. Two entrees show up and that's it. Three minutes later a third shows up. Finally our server comes over and apologizes that the fourth entree still isn't delivered. She explains that it will be up shortly. Two different people have stopped by and finally fifteen minutes later the fourth entree is delivered. At this point in extremely aggregated, our server sees this and sends over the manager Jesse.  Jesse comes by and does that annoying table knee and asks ""what going on folks? Sorry about the delay in your food.""  I explain that we intended to eat together. As to not be rude the entire table had waited for the last entree before we began to eat. As you can imagine the other entrees had become cold. Jesse decided that the most important thing to do was offer free cheesecake. I explain to Jesse that we haven't eaten yet and cheesecake was the last thing on our minds. I understand that the restaurant was busy but the manner in which the food was delivered was unacceptable. He agreed and promptly exited.  For whatever reason Kim(server) had become very standoffish.  She doesn't check back for quite awhile and when she does she offers cheesecake again.  We politely decline and ask for our check. We pay our check, and keep in mind, there was no compensation whatsoever.  As we are walking out I stop at the host stand and ask for the general managers information. The host feverishly looks for a business card. As we are patiently waiting, another manager(Kim) asks if she can do anything for us. I explain that we were just waiting for a business card for the GM because our experience was awful.  She looks surprised apologizes and immediately walks away.

Don Z.,"Bartlett, IL",63,169,50,3.0,8/22/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Woodfield Mall.  It is right at one of the main entrances.  Of course it shares the huge mall parking lot.  This often translates into having to park pretty far away because you are competing with the patrons of the entire mall for a spot. Also because of its location and it name brand recognition, it seems like this place is always busy.  I only come here for lunch, so I try to arrive before noon.  Never come on a Friday.  Everyone loves to go out for lunch on Fridays and you will be waiting forever! Once you get inside, the place is pretty large for a mall restaurant.  There is a hostess station just inside the door where they will take your name or prepare to seat you immediately depending on how busy it is.  There is a fair amount of room to wait.  There is also a bar to the left of the hostess station, but I have never sat there.  To the right is a display case of the cheesecakes to help you visualize the large variety that is available. When it is time to be seated you will be led towards the back of the restaurant.  The lighting is very dim... almost too dim.  Maybe I am not ready for that level of mood lighting when I am eating lunch with coworkers. The menu is huge with a ton of salad, pasta, and sandwich choices.  I have never ordered any of them.  Every time I go to Cheescake Factory I order the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes.  This item is on the appetizer section, but it is a hearty meal for one person.  They are a delicious mix of fried, seasoned corn meal, topped with avocado, sour cream, tomatoes, and a slightly spicy sauce.  They are a nice choice for vegetarians if that is a concern for you. Pro tip:  Do not let the server take your menu after ordering your lunch.  I always keep one so that I can ponder the cheesecake list.  If you don't heed my warning, you will be waiting a long time to get the menu back and then even longer for them the bring the cheesecake.  Sometimes I even order the cheesecake at the same time as my tamale cakes. This leads me to my review of the service.  Everyone generally seems friendly, but something is off.  I don't know if they are understaffed, or if the management has created barriers to efficiency that I don't understand.  I have been to this place on numerous occasions and the service always seems slow.  Early in the meal they are almost overbearing with the questions and the ""are you ready to order?"", especially when I go with someone that does not already know what they want like I do.  But after that you are lucky to ever see your server again. Getting back to food... the cheesecake is delicious.  I really like the key lime and the lemon raspberry.  I do have a few gripes.  It may be my imagination, but I believe the size of the slices got smaller over the years.  This wouldn't be all that bad (especially for my waistline), but the prices are steep with a slice going for $6 or $7.  I also wish they would use real whipped cream.  I like a cream counterpoint to the dense cheesecake, but the stuff they use is just as dense and based on the way it maintains its consistency, I suspect it is oil based.  Of course the durability is probably the reason they use it. Overall, I like eating lunch at The Cheesecake factory occasionally.  I don't love it, but I will be back.  I just wish they could fix the little things and I could rise above my middle of the road feelings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=260

To sum it up, they basically  have a huge menu and pretty much everything is super delicious. Oh and their soups are yummy, their hot white/wheat breads are great starters, and they have an alright happy hour appetizer selection. Waiters are always nice and attentive and there is usually a wait, so I would make reservations. If you ignore the fact that their food is extremely high calorie, you'll like eating here.

She comes to the table with a very rude ""what can I get you guys to drink?"" The tone in her voice was enough for me to be able to tell she did not want to serve us/be there. Didn't even tell us her name. She comes back almost 10 mins later with our drinks. We order our appetizer, she asks us if we're ready to order our entrees and we ask for a little more time. She sighs as she basically runs away after that, then doesn't come back for probably another 15 mins. She basically had an attitude the whole time we were there. I'm a server and this is not the way to take care of a table, especially when your trying to get a tip. I would think Cheesecake Factory would have higher standards for their servers. The only reason I even got her name was because it was on the receipt.  On to the food, we got the tex mex eggrolls as our appetizer and they were delicious, especially the avocado sauce that comes on the side. I got the pasta carbonara which was the best pasta I think I've ever had honestly. And my friend got the chicken madeira which was also very good.

This guy.  Honestly, I think I've been here over a dozen times and maybe ordered some once.  Only because the servings here are enough to keep you full that desert just doesn't seem like an option. Food here is always pretty good, as well as the service.  We went yesterday with a group of six and were sat in a round booth at the front where maybe at most, five people could've sat comfortably.  Since u front, it was a little noisy but that didn't really matter since we weren't the quietest group. Sunday brunch, just sat in time to still have the option to order from it.  Bruleed (i suck at using the accented letters) French Toast.  Two large pieces of soft, fluffy bread with  powdered sugar and two strawberry halves.  Presentation-9 Taste-8 Value-8.  Still, good french toast!  On to the jambalaya! Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya, I must order this 90% of the time I go there, this and the Beef Ribs which they unfortunately removed from the menu.  Can't go wrong with this meaty pasta dish.  Also had a strawberry lemonade which was delicious and refillable, but for $4.50 maybe i'll stick to water and take desert to go.  Place is always busy during peak times, especially on the weekends.  I'm not too sure they take reservations since we never try but it may be a first come first serve basis.  Hence the waiting area always being packed.  Anyways, 100% sure I'll be back.

The salad was surprisingly huge, with lots of well-chopped greens in a yummy vinaigrette as well as just enough candied pecans, beets, goat cheese, and asparagus. All in all, very tasty!

One downside to this restaurant is that it's in Woodfield.  Unlike the Oak Brook location where it's a separate building, this is attached to the mall, which makes parking suck!  We had to park pretty far which is fine when the weather is nice...or you're not stuffed to the brim with their delectable menu items.  It's a solid place where there really does seem to be something for everyone, portions are huge, and the staff is attentive and reasonably knowledgeable considering the huge scope of their menu!  They also have a large drink menu that includes spiked milkshakes and tropical selections as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=300

We orderd two drinks one pom. margarita and one blue moon, we also ordered the crispy fried cheese and the crab and cream cheese app  similar to crab rangoon.  The fried cheese came and there was no cheese just fried outside on half of the order.  We showed the waitress and she corrected, but the crab rangoon similar appitizer was not very good.  We then just decided to get a slice of cheesecake and be on our way.   I have been here on several occasions and at different times of the day and am never impressed.  For two drinks, a appitizer and a small tapas size appitizer and one slice of cheesecake the bill came to $42.00.  I am just not impressed.  The food is nothing to write home about and even though they have a ton of different flavors to pick of cheescake, my husband and I both thought the cheesecake we bought from Sam's Club the previous weekend was better than what we had here.

Jeka M.,"Chicago, IL",354,341,226,4.0,3/14/2010,"What can I say? Yes, you get copious amounts of whatever it is you order, and the menu is the size of a book because they cover just about any food style you could want. What's more, I've yet to find something they don't cook well there. The cheesecake is divine, though obviously mass-produced, as is the overly sweet whipped cream. It's usually super-crowded and the bar area is too small to have much of a chance to sit down and wait in. The service is quick, but to the point of being a little impersonal and actually making you feel a bit like they're just trying to flip the table. There's not much more to say... there are some down points, but the food is so varied, delicious, and abundant that... yay, I'm a fan?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=280

Jo R.,"Westmont, IL",21,144,181,4.0,5/14/2013,"On numerous occasions, I have wanted to dine at this restaurant. I rarely do. Why? The Cheesecake Factory, regardless of location, is always packed. And I am trying to avoid spending my waning youth groveling for a table. Truly, I have sprouted gray hair waiting to be seated at various Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Well, this day was different and we decided to wait. My mother wanted to visit the Cheesecake Factory for her day, Mother's Day. We tried to make reservations but the restaurant does not accept them. So, we prepared to wait at least two hours to gain entrance. Upon arriving, we were told it would be a 90 minute wait. It turned out to be slightly less, about 70 minutes.  We were seated around 5:00 p.m. and ordered drinks immediately. I ordered the red raspberry martini which was good. It was not the best martini I have ever had, but I could tell it contained alcohol. The raspberry taste was strong and it came with lots of foam on top, which I like. Two types of warm bread were also served as we had our cocktails.  For my entree, I chose the chicken salad sandwich with the green salad. It came almost laser fast; I was truly amazed. The sandwich weighed about 50 pounds and may have contained a whole chicken family. It was a mayonnaise-based chicken salad with chicken chunks, roasted almonds, lettuce, and tomato. I liked it, but I think I would have preferred a less chunky texture. The best part of the sandwich was the grilled brioche bread. That made it special. The green salad was a nice option. I chose it instead of the French fries. There are many other items on the menu to choose from; it is quite overwhelming.  If you hope to try the cheesecake, I recommend ordering it first or to-go. I cannot imagine having room in my stomach for it after the meal. However, if your stomach is a bottomless pit, or you train for eating contests, perhaps you can handle it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=280

Katy B.,"Milwaukee, WI",42,126,,1.0,4/15/2013,"This place is a joke, and a bad one. Who waits 2+ hours for mall food? Not this gal. Experience numero uno: last summer, stopped by to have lunch and was informed of a 2 hour wait for a table for two. No thanks. Some food is worth a 2 hour wait, and I am absolutely positive that that food does not come from The Cheesecake Factory. Second experience, this weekend: a group of 18, including folks visiting from out of town. The organizer called months in advance to make reservations and was informed reservations are not accepted. She was informed that our group of 18 should show up at 4 for a 6pm seating. While that would turn most away, we showed up dutifully at 4, and were told that they would not take our name so early, and that we should come back at 5. At 5, our group was told that there would be a 2-3 hour wait. Huh, what?  Upon calling the manager, a member of our group was told that it was ""not possible"" that we had been turned away at 4. Sarah (said manager) must have the ultimate faith in her employees, and perhaps she meant that it was not probable. This statement would still have been inappropriately condescending towards a potential customer, but may have still retained the possibility of being correct. Either way, it was not correct. We were there at 4, and we were turned away. So basically, to top off the in-restaurant seating debacle, the manager was not only of no help, she was unnecessarily rude. Customer service appears to be bottom of this chain's priority list. Guess what? Our group had an awesome night at Westwood Tavern. It is nearby, the food was delicious, and the drinks were great, too. Their servers and manager bent over backward to accommodate our group, and we had a fantastic night and great service. Quite a contrast from The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=280

I'm not a big fan of the place but thought we'd give it a try. The lighting is always really dark which I'm not a fan of (it puts me to sleep). The prices of their food are higher than most other places so I don't think it's a great value. They do have a large cocktail and beverage menu, but many of them don't have prices on them which is annoying. Their cheesecakes are overpriced (they taste a step above store bought cheesecakes) but I bet you can find specialized bakeries in the area that can do it for similar quality or better quality and less of a price. The food is average (stuff that I can make at home). HOOOWever, the service is good. They do come around and check on you a lot so I will give them a star for that.

Cheesecakes: White chocolate macademia nut- that's the one I got. Thought it was good at first but when I was almost done I realized how overly sweet it was. It was just okay.

I went to this cheesecake factory for my Bday and the whole staff including the duchebag manager gave bad service. First, I tried to reserve a table for at least 20 ppl on my bday a day ahead of time. The manager said okay. The next day when I showed up an hr early like the manager said...he said that I had to wait for an hr til they have a table ready. I did not really mind this. So we waited and went around the mall. The dumb waitress did not mention when we were going around the mall that the vibrator thing (the one that tells you that your food is ready or table is ready) can only go so far.  Anyways, once our table was ready, the manager and staff seated us. After only a few minutes of being seated, the manager comes up to us and tells me that ""if 80% of your party does not show up within  a few minutes, then I have to give up these seats to other people"". THIS PISSED ME OFF! WTeff? where was that in their policy!?!! First of all, if that duchebag can count, we were pretty much 80% of the party. A few people arrived kind of late and the manager wanted to kick us out bc he did not think 80% of the party was present. So since the people that did not arrive yet, we had to give up some of their seats to make this duchebag happy. But i pretty much argued with him that most of the party was here and that you don't tell a party about this stupid policy... He could of lost customers but he pretty much just kept his mouth shut about kicking us out. yeahhh. what now.  Food- we had to wait at least an hr for all of our food to be READY!

Also, the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes: PHENOMENAL!!! :D They were so delicious I wished I had ordered two! (but of course, I was anticipating the gigantic dinner portions Cheesecake Factory is known for.) My family and I went in for dinner: Dad chose the ""Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta"", Mom chose ""Evelyn's Pasta"", and I...well I wanted some all-american style meatloaf. So I went with the ""Famous Factory Meatloaf"" My only complaint is that they had not described the meatloaf's flavor or use of spices in that dish at all--therefore, I was expecting a completely different taste from it. When I took the first bite of the meatloaf there was a very very very strong taste/smell of some type of herb. I wasn't prepared for this kind of twist in flavoring of the traditional meatloaf. On the menu, all it said was ""FAMOUS FACTORY MEATLOAF: served with mashed potatoes, gravy, and corn succotash"". Absolutely no mention of the strong use of that one herb I don't even want to know the name of. Since I didn't want to spend my dinner eating mashed potatoes and corn, I alerted the waiter (Ryan R.) who immediately offered to switch entrees. He could definitely tell I was not satisfied, and took my alternative order for the Four Cheese Pasta with Chicken. A couple minutes later, the manager (didn't introduce his name) came to our table with a complimentary house salad with strawberry vinaigrette. He apologized for the inconvenience and informed us that he placed my order at the topmost priority and will be served as quickly as possible.

It was terrific.  The appetizers were terrific----try the Ahi tuna appetizer and the Spring Rolls.  Better than most Thai restaurants we have been to.   Although I really tried to get something different, I had this mammoth hunger for a burger and holy smack---it was one of the best I have had in years.  Been thinking about it since it was that good.   The girls had Orange Chicken and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  The OC was outstanding and the BBCS was very good but if you like it spicy, you will need to bring your own as they have no Asian hot sauce and although I slathered the burger in Tabasco, that flavor just doesn't do it when you need some Asian garlic red pepper sauce.  Also, apparently the chef ate most of the shrimp (kidding) but there were maybe a few at best.  Nearly all chicken. All in all, the food was better than great.  We picked up the cheesecake to go to eat at home during the Bears game and it was good, but too sweet and too heavy.  Yeah--I know---it is cheesecake.  But Eli's that we try is not that heavy and neither is the cheesecake I make now and then at home.  Theirs seemed really heavy like cement although flavorful on the initial bites. One last thing----they sell their sauces and dressings to go---but you should use them in 3-5 days and they must be refrigerated as they are made fresh with no preservatives.  Highly recommend their Ranch salad dressing and their Asian Peanut sauce and Spicy Cilantro sauce.  Wow---they are great!

Meredith F.,"Bayonne, NJ",142,11,,3.0,2/18/2009,"I used to be a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory ... but that was when it was more of a novelty, before they seemed to pop up all over the place in typical chain fashion.  The food is quite good no matter what you order. This time I tried something new (rather than sticking with the Pasta Da Vinci or the Chinese Chicken Salad). I had the Spicy Crispy Beef --- which btw definitely lives up to the spicy title.  Service was good, but nothing special. Portions are HUGE so be prepared to either feel the effects of overeating later that day or to take home an extra meal.  If you're looking for something a step above your average chain, this is it, but if you're looking for something original check out something a little less mass produced.

Jennifer M.,"Dallas, TX",69,34,15,4.0,10/31/2011,"I'm a fairly seasoned Cheesecake Factory patron, having dined at locations in half a dozen cities. I find very good consistency in the food, and this location was no exception. What really caught me off guard (in a good way), was the more intimate setting at this particular location. This location is in the Woodfield Mall shopping center's main building, which is probably the reason for the unusually longer and thinner design as compared to other locations. One of the features I usually don't like about the Cheesecake Factory is the high noise level. The arrangement of this location mitigates that annoyance by quite a bit. While it's not silent during busy hours, it's quieter than the wide-open locations. For those who have not been to a Cheesecake Factory, my food-related comments fit every location I've visited. The variety of dishes is expansive. Yes, it's a pain to wade through the advertisements in the menu, but I won't complain, knowing that it probably keeps prices down.  I've tried many dishes, and everything is always fresh and flavorful. The portions are huge, so those with smaller appetites should prepare to bring leftovers home. We always ask for our cheesecake desserts in a to-go box. The bread they bring around is great. We snap up the slightly sweet darker bread in as soon as it hits the table. For flavored iced tea lovers, their signature fruit iced tea is fantastic. I was once told it's a mix of mango and passion fruit flavors. Just beware that it goes through you very fast. The cheesecake itself is always tasty. The richer cheesecake flavors usually take me at least three sitting to finish, which means I enjoy it that much more often. The service on my two visits to this particular location has been prompt and friendly, something I've come to expect with The Cheesecake Factory. The prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of food we receive. I haven't been to this location during peak dinner hours, but there was no wait for our two lunch visits. Final verdict?  I would go back to this location, in fact I already have once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=360

In general, I usually end up getting Fish Tacos or chicken salad so I don't feel so horrible about shoving a 5gal fish tank's worth of food into my piehole.  My fish tacos and salads are always fresh and delicious.  My partner in crime during Cheesecake binges is a good girl and asks for a takeout container before starting her meal.  I don't have the willpower.   This was the first time I had the carrot cake here.  It was delicious, but now that I know it has 1000 calories and 62g of fat, I feel a quadruple bypass coming on.  Still, it was worth it.

Rita A.,"Gilbert, AZ",7,79,6,2.0,8/14/2013,"Went here in June with my husband after shopping for an appiteaser and a drink, what a mistake! First we were ignored by the Host as she discussed her hair color with another girl, then after being seated at a table with no table/silver wear our waiter was too busy to be concerned. It took 20 minutes for him to ask us what we wanted to drink, we place our order at that time and asked for silver wear and napkins. We never received napkins or silver wear, my husband took them from an empty unattended table. Another 20 mins and some other server brings out our appetizer and fresh bread that should have been given to us on arrival. We were starving and plowed into any offerings we were given at the time. Ten more minutes after our second request, we received our drinks. The only reason this place gets a second star is because the appetizer (buffalo chicken stuffed somethings) were very good, hot and fresh- could use more chicken inside! ; maybe it was because I would have eaten anything at this time.

Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2456,3000,4.0,5/4/2009,"Thinking we could grab a quick bite before a late comedy show we stopped in. Seriously, silly thinking. Cheesecake is never quick. We ordered and mentioned we were hitting a show, so if they could rush as best possible and close out the check as the food came out. We cut it close but were able to dine and drink in under an hour. It was late and the mall closes at 9pm, worried we would have to walk outside around the mall back to the Improv we inquired with staff, they were unsure as what to do. Luckily, a restaurant door which shares an entrance with the mall entrance was left unlocked so we were able to trek over to the wing where the ""Chicago"" Improv resides.  It was a late Friday night and it was busy, to avoid waiting we sat in the bar. They had the A/C on full blast, wondered if this was a tactic to keep people from sitting long periods in the bar area? Food was good as usual, had a BBQ pulled swine (pork) sandwich which was bangin' and a cocktail which had to be redone once, since it didn't taste right. Too much filler and not enough alcohol, the lightest pour ever. The second time, a charm. Seemed like the waiter was hitting on the one lady in our party which was fine, but he kept asking if we would buy dessert and take it along. My thing is, if we tell you in advance we're hitting a show, that's it. I think most people know that you can't bring food from another place into a movie or comedy club. Being that this location is at a mall it would be good if the bar area was bigger, the outside tables of the bar are considered belonging to reserved seating. Those seats at the bar and the four high top tables are not enough. Most times if it's a single at a table of four seats, people in this area do not like to share tables.

Went with another couple for a friends birthday and the wait wasn't bad at all for a Saturday night in the God forsaken Woodfield Mall. I like the colors used in the dining area because they have a nice warm inviting feel to them. The booths look nice BUT the seats aren't really cushioned so don't expect to bounce back up if you plop down (my mistake). The Service: Waiter was attentive, not really chatty but he had tons of other tables so no biggie. He kept the drinks coming and made appearances when necessary. Food: Our table had chicken nachos as an appetizer and they were excellent. I try to stay away from nachos at most places because they tend to screw them up or add a mountain of sour cream. These were just right For my meal I had a turkey burger with mushrooms and onions. This was the biggest turkey burger I have ever seen! I was eating for a half hour and hadn't put a dent in it.

Cheesecake: So say what you want about the Cheesecake factory, the cheesecake is so good here! We had the banana cream cheesecake and it was banana heaven!

Lisse C.,"Tucker, GA",1,63,5,3.0,7/13/2013,"This is one of about 5 cheesecake factories I have eaten at and still don't understand why this place is busy. The food is mediocre at best and overpriced.    My husband and I stopped in for dessert one night and sat in the bar area. The was a waitress taking care of a table next to us but since we were not in her section she did not even so much as say someone will be with you. She just completely ignored us as did everyone else that walked by for the next 7 minutes until our waitress came over. Due to how nice our waitress Sarah was the whole experience improved but no employee smiles there. Most of them look just pissed off and loathing every minute of being there.     While waiting for our coffee and chocolate tower truffle cake I watched the bartender making a drink and stick her hand (ungloved) in the glass to remove something. I'm not talking just a finger, THE WHOLE HAND! There was no ice in the glass yet which allowed ample space for all 5 digits, disgusting! Makes you wonder what goes in where you can't see when a employee does that right in plain sight.      Well the dessert and coffee arrived in a timely manner so we dug in. The cake was deliciously moist and rich. The coffee was good, tasted fresh even though it was late at night. Sarah checked back with us several times, she was very attentive.      I will say even though I don't care for their food they do a good job with dessert. If your name is The Cheesecake Factory then I would expect that anyway.

Elizabeth W.,"Des Plaines, IL",276,332,179,2.0,5/16/2010,"I've been here enough times and had enough not-so-good experiences that I'm taking a break from coming here. To explain why, I'm going to make a list of things I consider unacceptable at a restaurant, and point out that this isn't a dive bar or a hole in the wall diner, where I might expect this sort of thing. 1) When a customer orders something with no cheese, it is not acceptable to scrape cheese off of the item and bring it the customer with strings of it dangling off the food. 2) When a customer leaves the plate untouched for ten minutes, it is not acceptable for a server to not notice that there's a problem. 3) It is not acceptable for this to happen on multiple occasions, as opposed to it being a one-time fluke. The manager did come and apologize, but by then we'd been there about half an hour and one of us had finished eating. We didn't want the item replaced, we wanted to leave so we wouldn't be late for our after-dinner plans. The item was removed from the bill, but that doesn't really make up for the fact that the food did not arrive as ordered and nobody was paying enough attention to notice and fix it while there was still time. This has happened here so many times that I don't get why there's always a long wait to be seated. Doesn't getting the wrong food all the time put people off? Then again, with so many fried items on the menu, maybe people are so busy shoveling grease into their faces that they don't notice what's on the plate. My other issue with this place is the noise. It is incredibly loud. At one point, no less than five babies were screaming in close proximity to us, and a toddler was throwing a tantrum. I'm going to come out of the service industry closet here and admit that I used to work as a service trainer for a company I whose name I will not mention, and part of my job (among many, many other things) was teaching hosts and hostesses to space high chairs throughout the dining room rather than clumping them together. This is both for fire safety (if they're all pushed out into the aisle at the same time, it can slow people trying to exit the building) and for the benefit of diners, because the babies in those high chairs can make a lot of noise. Obviously they don't train the hosts and hostesses to do this at Cheesecake Factory. What a difference it would make if they did. I wouldn't have been popping Tylenol all night like they were candy. The only reason Cheesecake Factory gets two stars instead of one (despite the long waits, loud dining room, heart attack menu, and lazy shortcuts like scraping cheese) is the artichoke. Oh my god, can they cook an artichoke. If I come back anytime soon, that artichoke will be why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=400

The wait, the wait... oh the wait. (sigh) 2. A group of more than 4 people will probably wait longer. (heavy sigh) 3. Not a lot of room to stand around during your wait and the entryway gets jammed with waiting people. (oh, my lower back is starting to ache) 4. If you're going on a weekend or during shopping season, take off your coat, put down the shopping bags, and find a good wall to lean against because you will surely wait.

My wife ordered a pomegranate Margarita, and I ordered a blue moon. Ok so that's what we ordered and what we got was 6 pieces of fried crusts because the cheese had either melted out or just disappeared, a plate of won tons that have been over cooked and dry. The drinks by the way where good, nothing to really mess up. We did complain to our waitress, she was nice and she ran back and brought us out better cheese bytes, and that was that.  My wife and I skipped dinner and went straight for the dessert, we ordered the Coconut Cream Cheese cake, it was good. When we got the bill it was over $40, we felt a little disappointed.

Ivanka B.,"Stamford, CT",168,359,519,2.0,12/21/2010,"While I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, Cheesecake Factory is notorious for great service, quality dishes and that higher quality meal in a casual atmosphere. I made the huge mistake of suggesting to meet at Woodfield with co-workers the week before Christmas for lunch and thus had to suffer through an over 30 min wait (standing, which was no easy task since I have a stress fracture in my tibia) - oh well. This was the first time I was rather turned off by my food choice and the service. I understand that they're busy but the server hovered over us, and NOT in a good way. It was obvious he did not want us to sit there and talk shop but rather scarf down our meal and get the heck out.  I ordered something I have had before and really liked but unfortunately this time it completely missed the mark and made me nauseous - the ahi tempura roll appetizer. The tuna was super fishy and something just wasn't right, I barely ate 2 pieces. Normally, upon seeing this, a server would inquire as to the reason for non-consumption (in my experience) - not so much this time. Oh well - my own fault for coming anywhere near this mall and this restaurant during Christmas week. I still like you Cheesecake Factory but it's highly doubtful I will ever consume raw tuna within your establishment again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=400

Also, the bread they serve you is quite good and warm too!  Now, the service was HORRIBLE! As soon as my friend and I walked in, the hostesses greeted us with no smiles at all and looked unhappy to be there. Get this, as she walked us to our table, I asked if we can please have a booth and she totally just left us hanging in the middle of the restaurant and walked back to the front. After 5 minutes of standing there, she came back and sat us in the booth right next to the table. Why? I have no clue. So after sitting there for 10 minutes, the waitress FINALLY decided to come to our table. I could sense she was in a hurry and seemed like she wanted to take our orders quickly, lucky for her, we knew what we wanted. The food actually came out quickly and was great. She probably came to our table 4 or 5 times to ask if we wanted our food packed, uhm EXCUSE ME, we were clearly still eating, how rude! After the 4th or 5th time asking if we were done, she just came and put down our check when again, we were STILL EATING.

The line of people waiting was daunting on a Sunday - reminds me why I avoid the Suburbs like the plague.  Surprisingly, the bar was empty so I parked it there and enjoyed the friendly bartender and the no-Children scene.  I had three bloody mary's (oops).  They weren't bad but definitely not spicy enough for my taste.   For my meal I had the soup/sandwich/salad combo.  Nothing had flavor except for the soup that tasted like melted Velveeta.  My boyfriend's sister got a sandwich and specifically asked to remove the onions and peppers.  They didn't.  BUT our waitress was VERY understanding and helpful.  She came back with a free salad and a new sandwich in a flash.  For dessert we tried the Oreo mudslide cheesecake.  It wasn't too memorable (this is kind of disturbing at the Cheesecake Factory, no?).   Even though this place runs like a well-oiled machine, you won't find me back here anytime soon.  If you have to put up with a restaurants ""chainy-ness"" the food should be better than it is here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=400

He sent it back.

She declined.  Meanwhile my husband still did not receive his meal.  Please understand my husband is also diabetic and luckily had not taken his insulin.  As everyone finished their meal my husband requested the manager again.  He requested that they cancel his meal because everyone else was already done. They apologized again and then took off his meal as well.  My sister insisted on them giving us some free deserts.  They did give us some free deserts.  Even with that our bill was +$200.00 and my husband (Who paid the bill) ended up completely aggravated and   eating a sandwich when we got home.  Not the way we wanted  to celebrate the spring break visit with my niece.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=420

Mo k.,"Hanover Park, IL",0,1,,1.0,1/3/2012,"I have never been soo livid, after the experience I had at The Cheesecake Factory. For starters, it was my sons birthday, which in itself should be a joyous occassion. Being that I knew my party was going to be large, I figured I would call ahead to make a reservation. I spoke with Jesse, and was told that it was on a first come first basis. I thought that this was a bit peculiar, due to the size of my group, but I took her word for it. We arrived at 6:30, and we were told that since we had such a large party, that the wait would be an hour and a half. We waited for two hours, and still no table. After a while, I figured I would check on the status of the table, we were told that it would be ready shortly, as they had just finished up another party, and the aread was being prepped and cleaned. As if things couldn't get any worse, I then received the figurative smack in the face when I saw a group of 11 being seated after being there for less than 5 minutes. When I inquired how they got such V.I.P. treatment, the response was simple; ""because they had a reservation."" I'm not sure if I was speaking English when I called in at 1:30 in the afternoon to make a reservation; but apparently they pick and choose who they want to accomodate. I digressed though, so some minutes later, I went to check on the status yet again, now the hostess who was originally assisting us, had disapperead (how convenient). Another hostess came and got us, then we were escorted to the bar area, where a make-shift table was setup for us. Now, remember me stating that the whole purpose of us going, was for my CHILD'S birthday party. Why would they think it appropriate to place us in the bar with little children? Of course we were upset by having wasted soo much time, to be sat in some corner like peasants. In the midst of trying to figure out how such a mishap could occur, the manager comes out (at last some HELP...wrong!!!). The manager was actually worse than the people working for him, we were faced with an ultimatum: either we take the table or leave. To make matters worse, when I asked for his name, he told me ""You don't NEED to know my name, as a matter of fact leave right now!!"" Long story short we were essentially thrown out of Cheesecake Factory.

Peter F.,"Itasca, IL",2,92,,4.0,9/9/2006,"Another place like ""Wild Fire"" where the wait is exasperating enough to make a Monk pissed-off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=420
Sarah D.,"Matthews, NC",59,349,141,4.0,3/22/2006,See if you can get a seat by the front window overlooking the mall-great people watching seat! The Fire bacon shrimp sandwich is to die for and their salads are huge. There will be a wait if your party is more then 2 and maybe even then.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=420
Stephen N.,"Roselle, IL",3,93,16,4.0,3/30/2008,"VERY good food.  You get what you pay for, but you pay more than you get, more often than not.  If you're going for a full-fledged dinner, be ready to shell out $20 per person.  Unless, you try to pull the salad and bread cheap-skating plan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=440
Collette Y.,"Chicago, IL",0,33,1,5.0,1/22/2012,"I just came back from Cheesecake Factory and love it as usual. Servers are extremely attentive and eager to please. I don't eat cheesecake but here I'll make the exception because these cheesecakes ARE NO ORDINARY CHEESECAKES! Each one looks gourmet and beautiful and tastes just the same! You know how sometimes the looks of a dessert does not match the taste? Here, all are scrumptious!  I had a pulled pork sandwich which was the best I've ever had. The menu is so big anyone can find anything on it to suit them, whether large or small appetite or fat wallet or skinny wallet. Speaking of ""skinny"" , there is a special menu for those who want under 600 calories - check it out!  That will enable you to leave room for cheesecake! I always go around 11 AM. on a Sunday when there is no wait yet. In that way, I can decide whether I'll do breakfast, lunch or dinner at that moment. True, the prices are a bit steep, but you get what you pay for and I find the value worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=440

Joyce A.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",53,79,13,4.0,1/13/2008,"Yes, it is a chain- and no- there are no outside seats like the one on Michigan Avenue (I like to eat outside- weather permitting).  But there are some really neat little gems - and I ordered one the other day.  It was named the Luao chicken and it was served piled onto crispy wonton squares with a litlle bit of mango sauce which, for me, made the use of salad dressing unnecessary.  I really enjoyed this salad- not your ordinary chain chicken salad!  I made the mistake of ordering dessert- BIG mistake- you need several people to tackle the brownie - godiva chocolate ice cream plate- I really think that some restaurants on on the right track with offering mini versions of their desserts....although this is one really terrific dessert (definitely 5 stars), I doubt if I will order it again after a meal- unless I have several friends who want to help. I didn't care one way or the other about the decor- nothing special at all.  Janusz and I recieved excellant wait service- very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-schaumburg?start=440
