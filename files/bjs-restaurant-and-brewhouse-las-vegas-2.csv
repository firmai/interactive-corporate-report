Taylor D.,Las Vegas  NV,0,12,10,11/25/2017,4.0,"called the night before to set up a reservation. get there for our time and said our reservation was a ""call ahead"" even though the night before was told ""reservation confirmed"". we waiting about 20 mins to be seated. anyways the food  ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and two medium cheeseburger pizzas for the 9 of us. probably only had a couple slices of the pepperoni for us. cheeseburger pizza is NOT on the menu anymore  but they still make it if you request it. i highly recommend the cheeseburger pizza if you are into burgers and pizzas. the pizookies  very very yummy: recommend the regular chocolate chip as well as peanut butter. my boyfriend has celiac so he was able to enjoy the gluten free pizza (which may i add  is also delicious) and the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie (also very delicious) i\'d eat both!"
Reed B.,Orlando  FL,22,159,54,11/18/2017,5.0,BJ's is one of those places that you go when you want something dependable  somewhat tasty and with something for everyone in your party. This BJs hits all of those marks  AND manages to be the best one of the chain that I have been to.  Here's what put it over the top compared to its brethren. - Quick service.  I have never had my food out that quickly in a busy restaurant. And everything was cooked correctly! - Awesome service! Our waitress was extremely personable and professional. My personal favorite item is the chicken pita tacos  but the burgers are great as well! Pizza is actually my least favorite item but is also still quite yummy. A pizzokie is a required desert item.
Paul W.,Las Vegas  NV,339,898,439,11/6/2017,4.0,Always a solid option! You looking for this and that? BJ's provides a little bit of this and a little of that for whatever you are looking for. I have been coming here pretty much since it opened. Never a negative experience. From the service to the constant evolving menu  you can find your favorites and new additions to boot.I am a true fan! The difference is split between this location and another in the immediate are. It would seem....I always choose this location. The parking is in not F$%^@! up and the quality is solid!Enjoy!
Scott J.,Las Vegas  NV,0,16,,11/24/2017,4.0,Great service and now prime rib! This was a fantastic dinner that I was not expecting. First time having more than lunch  service from Kyle was excellent you must try his expertise as he sold this dinner.
Tiffany Z.,Las Vegas  NV,1334,221,1686,7/5/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Another solid meal at BJs. Wait was usual  about 20 mins. Our server was on top of everything from our extra napkins request  side of this or that  to keeping our drinks refilled. Food was cooked perfect. Our waitress Kaitlyn was friendly and service was great!Definitely recommend. Enjoy!! :)
Jenna T.,Las Vegas  NV,167,74,120,5/17/2017,4.0,Great place for good food. From pizza to to burgers you can't go wrong. Bj's is that kind of restaurant were you know 99% of the time your food will come out looking and tasting amazing.Weekly specials*Any weekday you come in they offer a daily special including; 1/2 off pizza on Mondays  $3 pizookies on Tuesdays  $10 burgers on Wednesdays and rib deals on Thursdays. Rewards program*Every time you enjoy a meal you will collect points for every dollar spent. Rewards include free pizookies  and discounted meals. The more points you rack up the bigger the deals. They also email you specials including free appetizers and restaurant specials.Weekdays are typically slow and weekends you will find there's usually a wait. Today they had an off day but sometimes that happens. We had a few issues with missing items on our meals but a manager came out to reinsure they were fixing my meal to the appropriate standards. Whenever we've run into any issues with food  a manager has always came out and talk to us. It's a nice gesture showing acknowledgement that they messed up and the problem is getting fixed. I come here for the food but the customer service is always extra great!
Barbara P.,Honolulu  HI,30,100,126,5/3/2017,4.0,I've never be disappointed in anything I've had here. I had the Prime Rib French dip...very good! It had the perfect amount of meat  melted Swiss cheese  great Au jus...French fries w/n ice tea...perfect!Hubby had the fried chicken w/mashed potatoes  lots n lots of flavor. Of course  he enjoyed the test tasting of different beers. We've never been disappointed  whenever we come here. They're pretty consistent so  we know we'll enjoy our meals  always.Our waiter  Scotty  was great! He was funny  pretty knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. He suggested the beer and food  he was right...fabulous!
Stefanie H.,Las Vegas  NV,21,77,26,7/22/2017,3.0,4 stars for food. 2 for service. We went for our pre-concert dinner. Let me say right now at 4pm on Friday  it wasn't busy at all (mostly seniors). Although our waitress was very sweet and personable  that's where it ends. I don't know if our waitress was having an off day  but damn! It was as if she was frazzled or distracted. We got the food before we even got our drinks. My husband was missing part of his order and ONLY received when nearly finished. The saving grace was the food. It was delish and portions good  so zero issue there. Will we be back? Yep. Worth another shot.
Ryan C.,Las Vegas  NV,102,52,40,3/1/2017,3.0,Place was ok. The food wasn't all that great. Few things we ordered.Half rack ribs with mash potatoes and fries. Stuff mushroomsCalamari Ribeye steak with asparagus and mash potatoes Ahi tuna and chipsPizzaPazookie ( chocolate cookie with ice cream)The service was great and towards the end of the meal the manager came to serve us  which I thought was weird but whatever. Overall I would only come back if I had too. I wouldn't personally pick this place if I wanted to go eat.
Elleyne M.,Las Vegas  NV,51,126,134,6/11/2017,5.0,BJ's offers delicious eats  a family friendly environment  and courteous service! Our server was very accommodating and we had appetizing meals including buffalo chicken grilled cheese and fish and chips. We loved that the kid's meal side of fruit came with grapes cut in half. This is an extra step  and our kids only eat grapes this way. We will certainly be back  well done BJ's!
Sarah A.,Southwest  Las Vegas  NV,129,140,273,10/11/2016,4.0,Came here for a birthday dinner on a Monday night. It wasn't too terribly packed but BJ's is always poppin no matter what time you come in. My bf and I were greeted as soon as we came in & directed to our party. There were 11 of us at the table and were seated all the way to the right of the restaurant. Since it was happy hour  the bf ordered bone in chicken wings (buffalo something & garlic parm) with fries & I ordered the Alfredo pasta with shrimp instead of chicken. The wings were pretty good  we should've ordered it extra crispy or something. I prefer my wings with more of a crunch. The garlic parm was a little too saucy for me but the bf enjoyed both flavors. The thin cut fries are always a good choice! My pasta was super good! The portion was huge so I could only eat half & saved the other half for lunch the next day. I shared a salted caramel pizookie with a friend and maaaan  it was delicious! I loved the entire meal. Service was okay. It actually wasn't great. I'm not sure if it was cos we had a large party or what. The guy hardly ever came around to our table. I asked for a refill for my water & never got one. He just didn't seem like he wanted to serve our table  honestly. So deducted one star for service.
Jessie H.,Las Vegas  NV,13,13,5,10/10/2017,4.0,"My friends and I always end up going to BJ\'s if we don\'t know where to eat and I\'ve never been disappointed yet! I always take the longest time to order here because they have such a great variety to choose from. Some dishes I\'ve tried here is the Chicken Alfredo  the country fried chicken burger  and the ribeye. They are known for their ""pizookies"" which is their dessert. It\'s a warm  freshly baked cookie that is topped with icecream. Recently I came in and tried their Churro pizookie which is just a bunch of mini churros with a scoop of vanilla bean icecream on it but it was so good because the churros are fresh and warm (It\'s only offered for a limited time too)!!! Anyways  this place is a great place to go to if you are in a group and you don\'t really know what you are in the mood for."
Ronen S.,Redondo Beach  CA,56,3,,8/11/2017,1.0,If I could give negative stars I would. Awful service. 20 minutes to get drinks  only then did she take our food order. Another 30 minutes to get food. Got some orders wrong. Appetizers arrived after the food: we had 2 littlest kids with us and they got their food last. They orders Mac and cheese. That was kraft mad and cheese clearly. It take 5 minutes to make. Why did they get it last?Asked to see the manager  never arrived  and we waited another 30 minutes for that miracle to happen. Awful. Won't be caught in this place again even if they pay me.This is embarrassing for their brand  and really  for any restaurant. Not even an apology from that. Yeah... no.
George C.,Sandy  Salt Lake City  UT,7,92,107,4/24/2017,4.0,Right off the bat I was a little disappointed that BJ'a Brewhouse no longer has my favorite Imperial Stout beer. I love in Utah  one of the most alcohol repressed states in the country (although getting way better) and I told everyone how good it was who asked me where to go in Las Vegas. They have a new Tatonka Stout. It's good but not as good. Our server Woody was excellent. Great personality and he really interacted well with us and the customers he waited on. Today's feast started with the BJ's HopStorm IPA and an appetizer of BJ's Brewhouse blond beer battered asparagus. The IPA was good with a light hoppy flavor. The asparagus stalks were too wide and over cooked. I won't order that again. The country fried chicken was very good and the mashed potatoes was the best I have had. I don't know what they did to the potatoes but it worked well with the chicken. Although I was a bit bummed out that they nixed my favorite beer I look forward to coming back for another meal.
Vilma D.,North Las Vegas  NV,138,70,97,7/18/2017,4.0,Great place to meet up with friends. The pros:Food is delicious. I especially love the mozzarella balls and tomatoes and the shrimp Peruvian quinoa salad. And of course  their pozookie. WOW! Location is right off the I-215! It's very easy to find. Everyone was friendly and kind. It took awhile for the waitress to get our order because they were very busy. However  we didn't wait very long for our food. The cons: If your are going here to have a quiet meal  you may as well leave now. It is very noisy. I could barely hear myself think. Lol. Overall  I will continue to come here.
Danielle D.,Las Vegas  NV,199,98,117,7/22/2017,3.0,I'm usually happy with my meal and service at BJ's. However this time around I was quite disappointed with the SERVICE  the food was still great! Our server wasn't attentive to us or any of his tables. I started to notice he would just disappear and not check on his section as often as the other servers would check on their tables. It was worse when we ran out of water at our table and it took 5 minutes for him to approach our table and another 10 for him to loop back around to us to refill our waters. This wouldn't have been that bad if we hadn't watched him grab the water container  walk past us refill waters for another table and then just disappear again. I'm disappointed with the service  I haven't had an experience like this in a while and I sure hope BJ's can step up service.
Poco P.,Las Vegas  NV,1581,350,2533,8/11/2016,4.0,Deep Dish Pizza .. BJ's Classic is my usual. The first time I tried this was on Eastern & since then I've only been able to order this lol! You know when you know what you want  but still you look at the menu? Love love love this pizza & it melts in your mouth. Preferably  I sit in a bar booth  but have sat at the bar once & in the restaurant. Always had good service & when I didn't once the person told me he was new  which I can appreciate.
C.j. C.,Tempe  AZ,109,10,,9/19/2017,5.0,Had a great experience as usual. Our food came out so fast and thank goodness  because my pregnant sister was starving. Always a great experience. Excellent service. I ordered the barbecued chicken chopped salad it is amazing  always the perfect amount of dressing. A++
Debi R.,Irvine  CA,295,155,55,3/20/2017,5.0,Our soccer team was in town for a college showcase and BJ's was closest to the hotel the girls were staying. I spoke with Donna (Manager) and arranged a pizza  pasta  salad buffet for the players and their families. She emailed me the contract and just like that  we were all set. When we arrived at BJ's for our dinner  I was surprised to find out that they don't start preparing the food until we get there. I was a tad bit panicked because the girls had tickets to see the UCLA game  and dinner was already going to be rushed.Not to worry. We were seated and they already had the salad out! The girls quickly pounced on that. Before they were finished  the pizza and pasta started making their way out. Perfection! We had plenty of time to spare. But wait! Better get the pizookies started  so the girls can have them right after dinner! Where is the server?!? Oh? He got the pizookies started already??? Phew! I've never been to a buffet where things ran so smoothly.I thought there would be a problem with the check...as there always is with a large group. Nope! The check was correct to the penny! We will definitely choose this BJ's again when we are in town! Thank you Donna  Ron and your staff for making our dinner so seamless. We will definitely be back!
Neil K.,Las Vegas  NV,0,56,51,6/12/2017,4.0,We had a large barbeque chicken pizza.50% off on monday. Service was friendly.Beer was cold.
Daniel A.,Las Vegas  NV,20,97,247,2/17/2017,5.0,We ate here for lunch it was pretty busy being a holiday but the staff was still nice the service still great . The food was very good. I always have great experience eating at BJ's this was no exception
Hector H.,Pomona  CA,54,6,,6/29/2017,1.0,The food was good. The service however was completely horrendous. Glasses of water went empty  that's if you were lucky to get one. Food came out without the necessary condiments. Example: a baked potato with nothing in it. No butter  no sour cream  nothing. Just the potato. Meals came with dessert  that never arrived. I've had bad service before  usually it's with new waiters so I am usually understanding. This guy just looked like he gave no shits about helping anyone.If you want good service  go somewhere else.
Ginny Q.,Henderson  NV,0,31,5,7/4/2017,3.0,My husband I came to Summerlin location on the 4th of July for early dinner. When we arrived it was slow  the hostess asked me to wait by the steps to be seated. The person who was sitting us had absolutely no urgency he was taking his time to grab the menus and utensil then finally we got seated next to a ditty table and it stayed dirty the entire time we were eating. We always go to the Henderson location because to close to our house  but today we were on the other side of town and decided stop and have a quick dinner and it was disappointing experience. Now our waiter was great and the food.
Nicholas S.,North Las Vegas  NV,24,77,110,1/21/2017,3.0,Stopped in and got the two for special. We got two drinks  then ordered the ultimate pepperoni pizza with peppers  and the cookie dessert. All while getting to watch some sports at the bar. Although this place is just becoming as normal as a Chilli's or Applebee's the upside is there is no hipsters hanging out here.
Hal T.,Las Vegas  NV,0,35,11,5/28/2017,1.0,Terrible. Appetizers came long after entree. Entree was not cooked. Appetizers were overcooked. Slow service from disorganized and frazzled waitress. Only the beer was right.Manager never came around.Never again. Avoid.
Rina D.,Mesa  AZ,1,23,45,10/7/2017,5.0,Our waiter was Bryce Z. on 10/7/17 and he was really great! Such a positive attitude  even though they were swamped with patrons because of Homecoming. He was very attentive and served us at a timely manner. Awesome guy!
Kelley R.,North Las Vegas  NV,28,5,1,7/28/2017,4.0,We enjoyed our visit today! Celebrated my daughters bday and grandkids like the food as well!!! Good service and food was great! We will be back. Thank you
Jordan B.,Las Vegas  NV,165,6,1,5/2/2017,2.0,Understandably  my family and I were moved from the bar due to me not having my ID. However  unfortunately the hostess didn't smile when we were seated and my moms food came out inedibly salty  and the manager Ron never came out to apologize. The only saving grace was Keith our serverr  he was kind and polite. Don't come to this BJs  service and food quality are falling off.
Wesley M.,Las Vegas  NV,13,24,3,9/20/2017,5.0,This is by faaaar....our best place to watch the Monday and Thursday night NFL games! They have great specials during the whole game  amazing food selection and all of it is delicious! The bartenders are the best  most attentive I've seen! They know what I drink after 4 visits and my loyalty number. They'll all friendly  funny and professional! Tracey  Allan  Tiara and Krystal are the regular bartenders when we're there. We see alot of repeat regulars that make going there an enjoyable few hours!
Stephen L.,Las Vegas  NV,69,3,,8/25/2017,4.0,The food was good as always. Our server Keisha was really nice. We had some minor issues with our order but they fixed it right away and offered us something to hold us out until our meal arrived.
Jeanie M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,7,,9/28/2017,5.0,super good and fast take out. I always call and my order is ready with in 20 minutes. The girls at the front are so cute and sweet! I will forever visit the bj's in summerlin! also you must try the pizza! ( sooo good ) thanks everyone for the a1 customer service.
love lv f.,Henderson  NV,8,162,,8/31/2017,1.0,For a chain restaurant you think their training would be excellent and their customer service would be off the charts... not the case with this location. We came in at 3pm on Saturday  plenty of open tables but still a decent crowd. We were seated and waited at least 10 minutes before someone came to our table. When they did  she grabbed the pepper shaker to give to another server  did not say hello or even acknowledge us. Turns out  she was our server. When she came to get our drink order another 5 minutes later  we had so much time with the menu we asked if we could put in our order. All simple food  tacos  wings  soup & salad. A salad was served at our table  way before our drinks. We then waited 22 minutes for our food. Yes  I timed it because everything else was taking so long. Finally our food came except for the bowl of soup. Refills were done before the soup was delivered to the table. While waiting I noticed plenty of servers at the hostess stand having free time  talking  singing and joking around. By the time my soup arrived  one of my friends had already finished her meal  and a second person was almost done. We were there over an hour and a half. No apologies for slow service  it was as though it was the norm. I also don't appreciate servers using pet names (baby  honey  love) when taking your order or serving your food and drink. The food was good  but with that kind of service  it's not worth the time.
Daniel S.,Henderson  NV,974,1135,6786,2/22/2016,3.0,"The neat thing about hiking is that after burning all those calories  there is the guilty free post-hike meal. After hiking on the UYE: Hike at the Potato Knoll  I joined up with Robert. W for a post hike meal at BJ\'s. It was a hop and a skip northeast on State Route 159. At 11:20 am  the parking lot  which is at the northwest corner of Route 159/Charleston at Pavilion Center across from Red Rock Resort was nearly full. That is a good sign.  Robert. W and myself sat toward the back of the restaurant where they have the microbrewery. My first impression was olfactory. There was a delicious smell permeating the restaurant. And we chatted and chatted. But when we chatted we were looking at a table minus menus. Where was the server? It seemed like we had spent an equivalent amount of time hiking from the Route 159 parking lot to the Potato Knoll until our waitress came on the scene. She half-apologized stating that she just started. ""Humm "" I thought to myself  ""what about the servers who had been passing us with no sign of acknowledgement?""   After the waitress handed us our menus  it was difficult making a decision. This is one of those restaurants that serve good breakfast and lunch. I was in a lunch mood. Decisions! Decisions! Should I go for the roast beef? The chicken club? The portobello Swiss? I finally decided on the crispy jalapeo burger. After a 4.5 mile hike  there was no guilt chowing down this 1 350 calorie burger. The waitress never hurried us  and let me take my time choosing the sandwich. Between the time of ordering til the food reached the table  the waitress handed us our drinks. Regardless that this is a restaurant and microbrewery  I went for a Pepsi.  The crispy jalapeo burger was delicious but not exceptional delicious like the Spicy Miso Burger I ate in Bachi Burger last Sunday. The thick burger was topped with the right ingredients: housemate guacamole  smoked bacon  pepper jack cheese  chipotle mayonnaise  red onions  tomatoes  and jalapeos. Equally as delicious as the crispy jalapeo burger was the potato wedges. This burger that is $11 and change includes either string fries or potato wedges. I favor potato wedges over string fries. These were tasty potato wedges. I felt that they could of filled the plate a bit more with the potato wedges.   BJ\'s was a good choice for the post-hike meal. Robert got to enjoy breakfast and I got to enjoy lunch. Based on this experience  I will Yelp out that BJ\'s serves good food but needs improvement in service. If I was alone  I would of walked out and reviewed it 2 stars."
Leslie M.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,585,332,421,2/18/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Was running around all day and by 9pm I just wanted to have a beer and a little pub food. I've had some BAD pub food last 3 restaurants! I've ordered take out from BJs before but haven't sat at the bar.It wasn't crowded. Tracy immediately came up and offered me a menu and asked about drinks. I wasn't familiar with any of their beers so I got a few tastes and then decided. Then I realized they had and did that. (Thankfully before she poured the big glass... which turned out to be my favorite of the flights)I ordered guacamole and chips and I swear it hit the bar in front of me in 6 seconds. Thin  fresh warms chips and great guac. I nibbled on that. Explored the massive menu. Worked on my beer flight and decided i was still hungry. Ordered fried artichoke. Again... 60 seconds and piping hot. Amazing.It was fairly slow so I noticed everyone was cleaning. I don't mean just wiping down the bar I mean the stuff that a lot of grubby places don't do every day. The experience was great. Tracy was fast  friend  knowledgable. I asked a lot of questions and she patiently answered and since I was alone she came by and chatted a bit when she wasn't totally busy. (I even asked questions about the spoon hanging from the tap because I was curious and other kind of dumb things that interested me.)The whole experience was as good as it gets for just walking in and wanting to nosh and drink. I love the pizza. I'm going to have to go back and try something more substantial.Thanks Tracy! You made it a very pleasant visit for me.(Manager... give the woman a raise!)
Rae B.,Las Vegas  NV,5,24,33,1/8/2017,5.0,"Probably one of my favorite places for lunch and dinner with the big  crazy family I have. Tips: Call ahead of time to put your name down on the call list and sign up for their loyalty program  you will not regret it. I walked in at 8 PM and it was packed. Every single table was filled and there were at least 3 families ahead of mine  but we only waited for six minutes to be seated. It was awesome. Reminder: Call ahead of time. The server I got was awesome. Juan was attentive towards myself and my family. He always refilled our waters before it hit the ""half-way"" line and always checked to make sure everything was going well. The food was absolutely delicious. I never have any complaints about their food. The environment was also great. They have huge tv screens for sport fans like myself. I highly recommend this place to anyone!!!"
Big T.,Las Vegas  NV,0,47,,5/22/2017,5.0,Ordered the Prime Rib Dinner with the starter salad and also included a regular size Pizookie  gotta say it's a good sized piece of Prime Rib!Server Beni is a very well rounded and knowledgeable server  great in all areas and knows how to treat repeat customers! Service and food overall was great on the Friday evening that we visited.
Cecy A.,Las Vegas  NV,30,8,10,6/18/2017,5.0,2nd time that I have been here for dinner and once again I am pleased with their service. Many delicious items on the menu. I'm definitely coming back.
Dawn M.,Las Vegas  NV,77,78,268,8/24/2016,5.0,Soooooooo good. Our server Woody was amazing!! I sooooooo love him. So personable and attentive. The calamari  sriacha boneless wings and the pizza were all amazing. I totally have no complaints. They even have a rewards program. For every $1 you spend you earn points to free food. I also unlocked a free appetizer thru Yelp! So yes I'm was winning at this restaurant. Stop in and check them out!!!!!
Rosanne T.,Las Vegas  NV,0,6,,9/9/2017,5.0,We absolutely love BJ's Restaurant in Summerland. The staff & food is spot on. It's one of our favorite places. Parking can be a little crowded  but there a quite a few restaurants in the area so that's to be expected.
Peter B.,Portland  OR,1,86,3,3/29/2017,4.0,It's Wednesday afternoon at 1:20 and there's no empty seat in the entire restaurant. The service at this place is simply amazing. Whoever trains this staff needs an award. The food was decent. Calamari was overcooked. Spinach salad was slightly over dressed and a little too sweet. (Small portion too.) The tea was good  not standout. But really my takeaway from here was the service. They even gave me an iced tea to go  without my asking.
Jon O.,Las Vegas  NV,33,3,7,8/30/2017,1.0,I placed an order To go through postmates when my order arrived  it was completely wrong. When I called the restaurant to see why  she told me I need to go through the app and request help  which I already did so. The manager on duty also told me that I did not order the veggie and I order the beef burgers. She also lied to me on how postmates works as I myself have driven for postmates in the past. If your restaurant makes a mistake own up to it and give good customer service. I understand mistakes happen but to lie and say I didn't order something goes beyond a bad review. I eat at BJs a lot but this will be my last time ever.
Lori C.,Reno  NV,39,32,74,7/18/2017,1.0,The service was great and the food was so salty that we could not eat 3/4 if it. So 3 people left hungry and we paid 78! Avoid this place. Even after we told the waitress the manager didn't adjust the bill for the crap food. So salty we didn't eat most of it. ...when I think about it  the beer helped to offset the salty...
Israel S.,Pomona  CA,2,43,33,8/8/2017,5.0,My fianc and I come here almost every Tuesday for the $3 pazookies and a yummy brisket burger. Service is always great and the fries are extra delicious. The food came put pretty fast as well. Kaitlyn and Alga were our servers today and they were really great and friendly. Definitely coming back
Kline F.,Las Vegas  NV,218,13,,6/2/2017,4.0,BJ's is a great restaurant with fantastic lemonade. The food is great and has incredible salads that are fresh unlike other restaurants. The service is usually good but can be slow at times depending on the occupancy.Perfect place for catching up with friends or looking for a family friendly restaurant.
Geishamom P.,Torrance  CA,0,44,15,8/5/2017,5.0,Made reservations for 30 people for lunch. The restaurant and staff were very accommodating - plenty of room for us and service was outstanding! Brian and Woody were our servers and they were friendly and responsive. They split bills by family for us  our orders came out correct   and drinks were refilled fast! This BJ's delivered exceptional service and we would definitely come back again!!!!
W G.,Thousand Oaks  CA,35,10,2,8/17/2017,5.0,We visited BJ's today and enjoyed their Happy Hour and dinner menu. Food was great and our server Arin was wonderful. She took great care of us and if we lived in town we would go back just to have her as my server along with the great food.
Sheri B.,Temecula  CA,93,8,,8/25/2017,5.0,We made a reservation as we had a large party with four kids. Nate was our server and he was outstanding! Smiling  had multiple tables and our huge  needy group. Never once had to ask or wait for a drink refill. Very impressed by his superior customer service! We are new to Summerlin. We will be back as Nate made our evening a great dining experience.
Larry K.,North Las Vegas  NV,0,10,3,8/12/2017,5.0,Salmon was excellent and so was the pizza cooked perfect and the service was amazing thank you bjs
Theresa C.,Las Vegas  NV,150,346,38,12/12/2016,1.0,This location is too busy and not worth it. We went to the Centennial location when we lived in Aliante and thought the minimal wait was worth it. But given the wait in Summerlin  I'd rather eat just about anywhere else. We put our name on the waitlist via the app. We checked in and were told 20 minutes. At the 30 minute mark  I inquired about how much longer? She told us there were 5 more tables ahead of us. All the while  we waited  she kept quoting everyone 20 minutes....clearly not accurate. It was so bad  there was a family with young kids that had been waiting over an hour and the kids were crying from hunger. Other families with young kids left while we were waiting as well. We also gave up....
Maria B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,20,1,10/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Just stopped by for a date night with my husband and this was the best part of the night. Our server Lynn in the bar section was so AMAZING!! She is just so bubbly and friendly. She is the epitome of customer service. She makes you feel like you are the only person around. This place is now our new favorite spot. The happy hour is great as well. $4 for a pint of beer and $6 for a burger and fried. Plus the pizzookie is only $3 this month. My whole meal with dessert is under $15.  We will be back soon.
Traci T.,Las Vegas  NV,268,153,123,11/20/2015,4.0,Yep  I am a fan. Yep  it is a chain. It's a chain done right and I give credit where credit is due. I enjoy a good beer  and whether it's a BJ's house brew or a guest tap  I always find something hoppy and malty to drink. I usually patronize the bar area  which is my go-to at most establishments  and this one is non-smoking so it's always a good choice. Servers and bartenders are always great and if you can make it to a beer dinner I highly recommend it.Besides beer  I generally order stuffed mushrooms  potato wedges (not fries)  salad (they have several that I like) or pizza. On a rare occasion I have a pizzookie. It's an awesome dessert  I just don't do sweet very often. The mushrooms are probably my favorite menu item. I think they are stuffed with the spinach and artichoke dip  among other things  and I cannot get enough of them. The pizza is great. It's pan pizza  like pizza hut style only really good. Not to be confused with deep dish  it's just a nice thick buttery crust and just slightly doughy. Health food it is not.
D J.,Las Vegas  NV,339,18,4,1/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Nate is a prime example of the best service you could ever get in the food industry! He is killing it in the game as a server... like seriously this guy made my day so great he made my day for tomorrow too lol #GiveHimARaise #PromoteHimDefinitely coming back for our guy Nate here!
Brenda M.,North Las Vegas  NV,67,18,1,6/12/2017,1.0,Took about 10 minutes to seat us way in the back. Server then took about 10 minutes to show up. She took the order. We all had soup  salad and a sandwich. It's been about 20 minutes and nothing still. Found a bug in the strawberry in the prosecco. The rest of the restaurant is served and happy. They are not busy at all. We're just in the back with absolutely no attention. Because we just ordered soup and salad right? Had we ordered maybe a higher priced item we would've gotten the service everyone else is having. So we will wait for our food as it has now been about 30 minutes since the order was so simple. First and most definitely the last time we'll come here. To top it off the server is not too excited to be here. The excuse was another big party was tying to get food. That tip is probably bigger and therefore more important since we are simple soup and salad. Thanks but no thanks.
Bethany M.,Henderson  NV,6,8,,7/30/2017,4.0,We always get seated right away whenever we come to this place. The service here has always been fast and friendly. My only complaint is that the menu is so overwhelming!!! There's always so much to choose from and it's hard to make a decision. Regardless  we always save room for their pizookie.
Diane B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,12,1,9/9/2017,4.0,My husband an I go to BJ's in several places both in California and Las Vegas. The food is very good but my comment is on the service. The server we request is Keshia very nice to my grandsons  very considerate. She is one of our reasons for going all the way to this BJ''s rather than a closer restaurant or eating in our hotel. Also I didn't get her name but the manager was very accommodating when we made a request! I could definitely tell customer service is a priority at this restaurant. A lot of places have good food but really good service will make you drive a little farther or wait a little longer  a well placed smile and welcoming service keep you coming back. Keisha makes this a welcoming place for us.
Marie B.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,23,60,90,2/1/2017,5.0,Their moscato mirrasou is the best white wine I've had in my life. Goes amazing with the white macadamia pizookie. Love how they have good deals with half off wine and appetizers! This location has been my go to always. For seafood lovers try their cherry glazed salmon it's so good  I get it with mashed potatoes and asparagus.
Michelle R.,Las Vegas  NV,4,39,20,7/16/2017,1.0,"Front host was great super friendly. Didn\'t wait for a table at all. Quick to sit us. (Party of 6) The sever we had was such a nice lady. However the quality of the food was terrible. First we ask for cokes and they kept giving us diet ones for some reason. We order poke bowl - don\'t get it  it never gets brought out but of course it\'s on the bill. Then my sister and I order the Nashville spicy chicken sandwich and mine is great  but they brought out the classic chicken sandwich instead for my sister. Instead of making her the correct sandwich they brought out some microwaved hot sauce to put on it. My nephew never got his side of fries (yet again it was on the bill.) finally the booth and the wall behind us was so gross and dirty. Didn\'t look like it was wiped at all for maybe days?! A spider bit my fianc. I can\'t believe this happened to us especially while in summerlin! We spoke to Allen he was very nice and actually cared what was going on. Then the GM Paul came over and blamed all the errors on the waitress. And that wasn\'t the case. She took our order correctly and the people in the kitchen and servers where the ones messing things up. Along with the bus boys who clearly don\'t clean properly. He was so unprofessional and quick to place blame and had the nerve to say that we were ""complaining"" I let him know that customer service is his job and placing blame on someone won\'t solve the issue of the food being poorly prepared and the kitchen not making the food in the back. I let him know it\'s a difference between complaining vs facts. Facts was  the food wasn\'t good  the place was dirty and we didn\'t get our complete orders  yet was charged for them. Paul  as a GM please work on ownership and customer service skills. We will not be back. EVER. #bye!"
Toni T.,Las Vegas  NV,4,34,38,12/27/2016,4.0,This maybe my favorite restaurant when it comes to chains. No matter what city I'm in  Bj's is consistent when it comes to quality in my experience. The Summerlin location is no different. We always have great service and drinks. I also love the fact that no matter what you're in the mood for  they're a something on the menu to satiateI love the kale and Brussels sprout salad. I always add shrimp and although they're not generous with the shrimp it's an adequate serving. The vegetables in the salad are always fresh. I also like the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. Bite sized full of flavor and yumminess.
Jillian W.,Las Vegas  NV,279,8,9,10/28/2016,2.0,Does anyone else agree that the best part of a wedge salad is the blue cheese crumbles? I came here for take out just for two wedge salads and they both came with a pinch of blue cheese  so little I could barely taste it. I think my picture does justice. The take out service was alright and I tipped the lady that helped me but this wedge of lettuce and a sprinkle of tomato  onion and bacon is not worth $5+
Steve V.,Las Vegas  NV,122,63,22,7/17/2016,2.0,"The staff Is friendly and the beers are good  but today is not their day for food. We have tried the ""new"" deep fried portobello mushrooms  which looked amazing. Unfortunately they taste like grease. Then we moved on to the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts...(picture enclosed)...they were burnt  bitter and unappetizing. Very disappointed.Now to the Nacho Flat Bread...looks good  but the crust is burnt. Whoever is the chef today (July 17th 2016) needs to be fired...or think of a new profession. It is taking everything I have not to personally walk this back to the kitchen."
Ginni K.,Las Vegas  NV,0,38,12,7/9/2017,4.0,Spinach filled mushrooms - super YUM. Also had the cherry chipotle glazed salmon which was delicious. Loved the sweet and spicy flavor.
Melissa C.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,240,578,1575,8/5/2015,4.0,Pizza has always been a specialty here and I've tried a few of the personal size. The beer is pretty good too. I wasn't sure this place would be good for a date but it was rather fun. We were seated close to the bar which worked out well. It's rather a family heavy crowd in general. The ginormous menu is Cheesecake Factory size  which I find annoying. I had the Italian spicy thin crust pizza and that was very tasty. I love a spicy pie!The 4 beer sampler I had was good too. My dining partner had a happy hour beer and wasn't offered another before happy hour ends  which a good server should always do! He did get another at happy hour price after asking  so crisis averted!
G S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,7,,9/28/2017,1.0,"No no no-  Always good service and food......till now! After waiting 15 minutes to be offered a beer- it is a brew house- yes?? Waiter slides us 2 menus and says- ""I\'ll be back.....no no  no I said and he looked right at me and gone! When he came back I said that I never wait more than 10 minutes to be offered a cold beer and that it had been more than 20- asked if it would be another 15-20 before beers came - his response- probably! Huh!? You said probably? Yes I did. Requested manager and reported that and she apologized- said she would take our drink orders and handle it-----oh but not to be- another 15 min. wait........Cmon folks.....someone has $millions$ wrapped up in this operation- don\'t p--s it away!!!"
Phil S.,Las Vegas  NV,58,51,,6/1/2016,4.0,I've been enjoying BJ's Summerlin since I first moved here back in 2006. They're pretty quick with their service and they always get my order right unlike some other places that seem to forget little details. When I say no l don't want lettuce on my sandwich  they don't put any on it! When I ask for condiments on the side  they'll put them on the side!My favorite item to order there is their California Chicken Sandwich. I'm not a huge fan of avocado  but the combination of avocado with green chiles and the juiciness of the chicken is just out of this world!Of course  you can't talk about BJ's without mentioning the Pizzookie! I can't tell you how many of these I've tried  but it's a lot! They're just the most delectable dessert in the world! I cannot stress how good they are!Best time to go is definitely a little before the lunch rush around 11:30-11:45 AM or later evenings after 7:00 PM.
Kimberly H.,Las Vegas  NV,71,33,13,6/12/2017,5.0,Excellent food & service every time I go. Went in on a busy Saturday (party if 3)  during several graduation big parties. We still received excellent service & great quality of food. I will definitely continue to dine here!!!!
Nicole F.,Las Vegas  NV,113,334,1415,11/11/2016,5.0,BJ's was treating Veterans Day right  received any meal for free plus our waiter gave us free dessert. Service was great  food was great even being crowded on a Friday night we got seated within ten minutes. Definitely be back !
Naomi N.,Las Vegas  NV,536,244,1691,6/14/2015,3.0,"SCRUMPTIOUS THICK PIZZAS!I absolutely love BJ\'s so after a doctors visit we had were hungry & unanimously chose this spot since it was also on the way home. We ordered take out & decided on 2 LARGE pizzas... when we arrived to pick up we noticed on the board that there was a family style package meal that includes 2 Large pizzas  salad  wings  & 2 sides for around $5 more than what we were already paying for the 2 pizzas we ordered & when we tried to mention it to Brianna when paying out she was just super rude about it & also had no idea about this special. "" o... I guess you can...."" in a rude tone of manner i would have to say as we pointed out what their special entails. We also had to witness her being a bit toney w/ another person that was trying to apply to the place... =/ that\'s my reason for the 3 star... The food was great though even if it was take-out... by the time we got home it was still hot & delicious. But one thing that really SUCKED was that we had asked for extra ranch on the side for the pizza & when we got home  all we see is the one ranch that came w/ the wings =[MASHED POTATO - very smooth & rich creamy flavor... I love it when such a simple dish is made perfect. FRIES - crisp skinny fries Can\'t complain they\'re fries.BUFFALO WINGS - the sauce was on the side & it came w/ a good amount of celery sticks.2 LARGE BUFFALO CKN PIZZA - although I usually go w/ the GREAT WHITE  the Buffalo chicken pizza here is delicious... not too overwhelming & perfect texture to the crust as ALWAYS & the right amount of protein & veggie ratio for each bite! SANTA FE CHICKEN SALAD - refreshing salad w/ some crisp to it w/ the tortilla strips & the Santa Fe dressing was awesome.Hope to be back to try the dine in experience since I usually go to the one on eastern. Hopefully it will be a bit more friendly when dining there."
Ryann C.,Las Vegas  NV,201,3,,12/28/2016,5.0,I love BJs! Alan & Tracey are the best bartenders west of the strip! Friendly  attentive  fun  speedy  just a pleasure all around to come in and see them when I get off work  want a drink  some good food and great service! The wait staff and managers are alsi always so friendly and welcoming! Tonite I had the Black n Blue burger (always good and one of my favorites) my normal Ketal & Tonic with 2 limes and my favorite  a lemon drop shot....Tracey makes the best!Thank you BJs for always making my experience through the moon!!!
Marie R.,Las Vegas  NV,0,30,3,2/4/2017,5.0,Came in first time customer and Nicole N was my server and she was a. Deaths of fresh air super kind to my kids which is a breath of fresh air because they were super busy and she was so pleasant. I will always ask for her and the food was amazing!
Edith S.,Las Vegas  NV,132,124,313,3/19/2016,4.0,"It\'s been a few years since I\'ve been to a BJs since there\'s just so many places for a late dinner in Las Vegas.First  Krystle  our server  was fantastic. She knew her stuff. As my husband was choosing his ""Pick 4"" beers (@$6.95 great deal)  she could tell what kind of beers he liked and gave him some suggestions. He ended up changing two to try something new. And he was happy he did.Because it has been a while since we\'ve been to BJ\'s  asked our server what she would recommend as I wanted more of a dip. We went with her suggestion of the Pork chili verde Queso dip  and we were happy we did.Dinner was good. My husband with with a rack of ribs  while I went with the shrimp and asparagus penne. However  because I\'m more of a noodle person  our server was okay with me changing penne to spaghetti noodle.And of course  we had dessert. Pizookie! With the amount of options  she suggested that we do a half-and-half. I choose the white chocolate macadamia nut while my husband choose Peanut Butter. Next time  we\'ll try not to fill up so much and go with the Pizookie Trio instead.And lastly  be sure you get that ""$10 off $35"" deal. It ends on 4/6/2016."
Jessica C.,Las Vegas  NV,1059,275,379,5/27/2015,4.0,So you walk in and see this huge beautiful restaurant. Sadly we didn't know we were going here tonight so I wore pajama pants. It's not too fancy but nice for a not too pricy dinner as well. We got seated and ordered our drinks. The first 2  maybe 3 pages were nothing but beers or wines. When the food came it was literally so hard to decide. Such a big menu and so many things that sound really good. I couldn't decide for a while. I got the sirloin steak  an appetizer (fries)  and my steak sides were mashed potatoes and clam chowder. The fries were really good  the steak was smaller than the portioning of mashed potatoes (I'm actually being serious I've seen a french fry that was better than the steak)  the chowder was hands down the best. Service was amazing and I'm honestly very impressed from this place. Even though the steak was very small  I still got realy full to where I couldn't finish it.
Robert W.,Henderson  NV,229,461,380,2/21/2016,4.0,I've eaten here many times over the years. Today I stopped in with a friend for a post hike beer and breakfast. A bit slow to start as it seems like our server was just coming on duty. No other server could be bothered to get even a water or drop off a menu. I give those servers a one star rating. Our server was nice  and prompt and gets 4 stars. I've usually gotten decent service over the years...so this was just weird. Food  as always  is good. Eggs  french toast  applewood bacon....all good. I really like the crunchy chicken salad with honey mustard dressing here as well. Mini pan pizzas are also delish! Never an issue with food quality here.The menu is extensive  and they have a nice selection of beers. Their Hefeweizen is nice. Everything from Pale Ales to dark. They also have on tap the usual favorites Blue Moon  Stella  etc. etc. I've always liked coming here  plenty of tv screens for sports. There is an offer on Yelp for BOGO. Try it out and see if you enjoy it.
Ashley M.,Las Vegas  NV,108,1,,4/15/2017,5.0,I visited BJ's last night and was SO impressed! The employees spoiled my one-year-old son with a plate of fruit and friendly service. And even just thinking about the pizza makes my mouth water. Thank you BJ's!
Troy B.,Las Vegas  NV,4,34,2,11/18/2016,1.0,When you get seated prompltly at 4:45 with a less than half dining area And wait more than 10 minutes without staff even asking for a drink Order  one asks why give BJ's your business! And to thinkWe come enough to be rewards members. Bye Bye BJ's
Tony H.,Las Vegas  NV,41,253,38,9/23/2016,4.0,Good eats and great service. I had a burger  sounds pretty mundane and typical but it was good. Cooked the way I ordered it. Service was very efficient too. Good selection of house brews too. Their Oktoberfest was very tasty  crisp and clean  as was their ale. Been here many times and it's always good.
Kristine M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,48,16,2/7/2017,5.0,Love BJ's! We really like the happy hour - tonight we had boneless wings & flatbread pizza. Great combo! Our server Alan was fabulous! Very attentive & but not bothersome! Pazookis are the best! Traditional chocolate chip cookie-can't go wrong! Sweet warm goodness!
Lynette C.,Las Vegas  NV,34,161,276,2/24/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,we opted to come Saturday late afternoon. It wasn't very crowded....YAY for beating the crowd.We sat at a booth at the bar. I couldn't decide between baby back ribs or pizza. I can get pizza anywhere right?!?! BRING ON THE RIBS! OMG...super tender  just the right amount of sauce and the French Fries were uber hot and crispy and thin. Just the way I like them.E of course got the jambalaya. Didn't he get this before lol. Yep just checked previous review....a creature of habit he is :)I am so bad at getting the names of the wait staff to include them in my reviews but yep....once again I didn't get it. Shout Out to the gentleman who waited on us in the big booth on Saturday late afternoon in the bar area :) He was nice  fast and not annoying checking in on us every 30 seconds yet not taking forever and a decade to come back and check in on us. Awesome evening yet again at BJ's!idiotic self forgot to use my rewards card....oopsie! Next time right?!?!
Steve F.,Las Vegas  NV,68,4,,1/14/2017,5.0,Food was pretty good. Salad dressing bland.Problem was service. Finally got ketchup as I was done with meal. Definitely need better training for wait staff.
Jay M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,7,4,9/30/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Decided to try Bjs out again. Big mistake. Got home and my turkey burger had no toppings on it but onion. It comes with a lettuce mix and cranberries also. That was missing. Once again  bjs can't get their to-go orders together. I will definitely not come back ever again. Such a hassle and disappointment!!
Jayson C.,Las Vegas  NV,93,36,10,4/28/2017,2.0,Great food horrible customer service  but if good food matters most to you that's all that matters. Meanwhile if you have kids or a family it might be rough. Being in Summerlin they like to take care of the Summerlin people and could care less about the regular people. If you're single and hot you'll get a table quick if you're a family or fat good luck!
Jon F.,Las Vegas  NV,49,24,22,9/16/2016,2.0,I'll have to drop this place to 2 stars.Unfortunately  the service wasn't as great. Numerous mistakes were made. I mean the food hits the spot no doubt. However  sitting your customers in a table where it hasn't been PROPERLY cleaned is another thing.We've asked numerous employees for assistance  but our request was passed on from one to another. Another issue was upon food delivery  there was no utensils? How are we suppose to eat? Hmm.. also  food order was wrong.Now  I understand that it gets very hectic and all on some occasions. But this is no way to cater paying customers. Everything was slow  barely any water refills? But when it came to giving out the bill it was hella quick? Cmon now.. Improvements have to be made. Thank you.
Diego T.,Las Vegas  NV,2,7,,5/13/2017,1.0,Quoted a 1 hour wait. Took almost 2. We were just a party of 6. Saw 50+ people leave. How hard is it to push 2 four person tables to accommodate a party of 6. They did offer to get an appetizer started for us. Thanks.
James H.,Las Vegas  NV,251,109,123,5/23/2015,3.0,We've been eating at BJ's on West Charleston since we moved here. With a large assortment of menu choices  a kid's menu  and a nice beer selection (including BJ's own delicious assortment of brews)  there's something here for everyone. If you've never been before  or you get lost in the large menu  I'd recommend the Crispy Fried Artichokes (artichoke hearts) or the Avocado Egg Rolls for a starter. Moving on to main course choices  try the Bacon Cheese Burger  New Orlean's Jambalaya  or one of the Tavern Cut Pizzas. The Spicy Pig or Garlic Chicken Pesto are both favorites. If you're in the mood for salad as a main course  definitely check out the Kale & Roasted Brussel Sprouts Salad. There is also a good assortment of dessert options for anyone who is still hungry after the meal. Finally  there's a gluten-free menu for those who want or need to adhere to a gluten-free diet.In the larger restaurants in the chain  the noise level is slightly above average  and has even been noisy at times  but it's never been too loud.As I mentioned  BJ's brews it's own beer; you have 10 beers and a hard cider available to chose from. They also carry a nice assortment of others beers as well  so you're not bound to their own brews. By the way  the in-house root beer is delicious. Be sure to give it a try during one of your visits.Finally  the West Charleston location is conveniently located near Red Rock Casino and Downtown Summerlin  so consider adding this BJ's to your dining choices if you're out and about in the area. They're consistently good and worth a visit. Enjoy!
Jessica U.,Las Vegas  NV,105,7,3,11/19/2016,3.0,"Went to dinner last night with my boyfriend and we both agreed this location has definitely gone downhill in the last couple of years. We both have eaten at this location numerous times before and have been pleased with the food in the past but something has changed. My only big complaint is the food. I ordered an ahi tuna salad which came out with NO salad dressing... like how does a salad come out with no dressing?! Also when my boyfriends food arrived the man who gave it to him spilled his ranch all over his plate and said ""your ranch spilled on the plate""  didn\'t ask to help or to get another ranch. We both thought it was pretty rude. Ok service but sucky food!!!"
Doug K.,Incline Village  NV,0,2,,6/6/2017,1.0,"Waiter dressed like a plumber should have been our first clue - butt crack and all. He was incompetent despite having a tablet that was doing the work - he couldn\'t find the drinks or the menu. What a surprise - service was even worse. ""I\'m swamped. I\'ve got six tables."" They were all doubles  within arm\'s reach.We left w/o receiving several items."
Karina H.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,3,5/29/2017,5.0,I had the super salad with grilled chicken and my bf had the lemon thyme chicken (he shared lol) and it was bomb!! The chicken wasn't dry and you can tell they we're prepared well and wasn't frozen. The salad was fresh and the dressing wasn't overwhelming. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the strawberry lemonade- it was too sweet. Oh! And the server was very nice and checked up on us :)
Jackie H.,Las Vegas  NV,28,24,83,3/28/2017,5.0,I came after watching a movie at downtown summerlin and they were so kind and our waitress let us try beer to see if we like it. Service and food is fantastic. Thank you so much
Evelyn V.,Las Vegas  NV,1,13,6,4/2/2017,5.0,Our waiter James was awesome !!!! Very good!! And he recommend the best beer ever for me !!! BERRY BURST.
Rovin C.,Southwest  Las Vegas  NV,6,9,1,6/12/2016,1.0,I love BJ's  but I just had a terrible experience here and I hate to bring up race. I asked to watch the soccer game and it took 10 minutes to switch the Channel. After they switched the channel  a couple of folks  that happen to be white  that barely arrived  complained about the soccer game and wanted to see baseball. The staff immediately changed the channel to the baseball. Honestly this is beneath me and BJ's  it's the the fact that it happen. The server should have kindly told the couple that there was a request before them  and should have given them alternative accommodations.
Adam W.,Las Vegas  NV,12,69,1,8/2/2016,3.0,"Service was good  and lots of people in my group enjoyed my meal. However  I got the chicken and bacon ""Mac & Cheese"" but was disappointed because it was really just pasta with cheese sauce. If I had known that  I\'d have tried something better."
Nicole T.,Las Vegas  NV,0,20,,8/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,We always come here love the food love the service love the rewards program you get a lot for your money and the food is always good also Britney is a great waitress  goes out of her way to be very accommodating   do yourself a favor and come here   you'll thank me oh and ask for Britney
Elisse V.,Chinatown  Las Vegas  NV,1,3,23,9/10/2016,4.0,Waitress is great... The dry rub siracha wings are my favorite here besides the pazookies
Jessica S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,1,2,4/4/2017,5.0,Buffalo chicken grilled cheese is so good  bf had the bacon burger and BLT salad  started with artichoke dip EVERYTHING IS AWESOME
Karen L.,Las Vegas  NV,40,84,20,1/20/2017,3.0,I only gave it 3 stars because the fish and chips had an awful coating. 3 of us ordered the fish and chips. Over salted  too heavy and gummy coating. Everything else was great. Nice server. Good beer. This place usually doesn't disappoint.
Kayte F.,Centennial  Las Vegas  NV,368,27,29,1/21/2017,3.0,Love the place but they always take forever when it comes to taking orders and bringing our food out  they actually forgot to bring my food out so I had to wait 15 mins after they brought everyone's food out... server was never around we'd always had to ask to refill our drinks.
Bryson H.,Las Vegas  NV,82,184,3,12/2/2015,4.0,"The portions here are surprisingly large. For a chain restaurant  the food quality is quite good. A very  very easy 4-star review. Have no fear about ordering here  you may not be totally wowed by your experience but you\'ll definitely not be disappointed. My wife and I both ended up ordering the same thing: Santa Fe Salad. She got chicken  I got chicken and in addition the salmon (typically it\'s a substitution  I ordered double meat). I ordered mine without bell peppers as well.A bad restaurant would reply to removing bell peppers with ""Sorry the salad is pre-made we can\'t do subtractions."" BJ\'s just said ""okay"". That\'s a great first sight.As appetizers we had Chicken Potstickers and Potato Skins. Let me just review all the food at once: for the price  I got larger portions than expected; the flavor was great  the food was cooked well  the variety of ingredients in the dishes was as-expected for potato skins  and was a pleasant surprise for the salads.I\'m not sure why I don\'t give this a 5-star review. 4 seems like the right answer. While everything was good --really good  just what I was looking for and up to my standards --it is still a chain restaurant  and nothing really *pops* about it in a unique or outstanding way. BJ\'s is definitely one of my go-to restaurants for classic  totally solid American-style food (even though I ordered a mexican-inspired entree salad and an asian-inspired appetizer)."
Robert R.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,96,1,,7/26/2017,5.0,Phenomenal customer service  i ordered a shrimp pasta lunch plate and at the time of delivery i got no shrimp when i realized it i told the waitress who apologized (which wasnt needed because the chef messed up) and told us shed bring us some shrimp. 3 minutes later the manager comes by and tells me that that plate was on the house and apologized for the minor food setback. The waitress was awesome i unfortunately do not recall her name.
Tracey B.,Las Vegas  NV,11,47,21,1/18/2017,4.0,I have been to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse many times this location is my favorite. Food is wonderful has a very wide spread selection to choose from. The beer they brew is awesome very tasty love that they give sample flights to taste from in decent size glasses. I was a bit shocked when I found out that they don't offer growlers ( take home beer ) for taking your beer home. They only have growlers for their sodas I hope this will change. The beer dinners are very fun and educational you get to sample different beers not just the beer they brew. The beer dinners often have decorations and good dinner that includes appetizer and desert from their menu. Staff and customer service has always been good and wait time can vary based on the time you get their.
Carl P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,53,43,1/21/2017,5.0,Excellent food  restaurant is clean and service was great. We would highly recommend this place to all in Vegas.
Geselle R.,Henderson  NV,886,381,4465,10/28/2014,4.0,This BJ's never seems to disappoint me. Today we were there for lunch and the waiter was so nice! Our food also came out very quickly today. I was surprised!I got the half pasta and soup or salad lunch combo. I ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti and a bowl of clam chowder. Reason why I got soup was because the last time I had the house salad  I didn't really like it. It didn't have enough dressing  it seemed a little dry. The spaghetti was really not that spicy but had a light kick and a different type of tomato sauce  but it was enjoyable. It was really good price  about $9! My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a bread bowl which was about $8. Their clam chowder is really good! It comes out hot and fresh. He adds a little tobasco for more flavor  and I just like it the way it is.We had calamari for appetizer and it was delicious as well. It was crispy and a pretty decent size. I've seen it bigger at other places but I'm not complaining. This was about $10.25 I believe. As for dessert  ALWAYS the pizookie! Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream is always the traditional way to go! Sooo yummy and always hits the spot.Because I'm a BJs card holder  I was able to get $10 off $35 or more  and we had just reached $36. So the deal was soooo good! Imagine if I had 4 people come and everyone ordered off the lunch menu.... What a deal!!This place is clean and friendly and has pretty good food. I've had their Cajun pasta and shrimp scampi  both very flavorful. I've also had the angel hair Classico which is not as flavorful but good if you don't want a strong flavored pasta. Their pizzas are yummy and shareable size! Over all  BJs is one of my favorite places to go!
X-tina L.,Honolulu  HI,10,28,,11/13/2016,4.0,"The service was good however we came here because the pizza was supposed to be amazing and it was good if you like 20$ bread sticks. Lets just say we wont be going back for ""pizza"""
Joe M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,9/18/2017,1.0,"I always have liked the food here  but the wait staff has become simply pathetic. I went to BJs on a Monday night when the restaurant is less than half full. I had a young (maybe 16-17 year old) Hispanic ""gentleman"" as my server. He never gave his name. He mumbled when taking my order and showed little interest in being polite. I hardly even saw my waiter. He had absolutely no interest in doing his job. The time he was actually on the floor  he was either chatting with other waiters at the bar or chatting with girls. While waiting for him come to the table and split our check  he spent 20 minutes talking with two girls one table  laughing and having a great time. No other server approached the table during this time. I tried to approach the bar to get the bartender to split the check  but he refused. A large  black woman (I assume from her clothes that she was the manager) was also just standing around. My friend made a snarky comment to her about the terrible service as we left; she responded like she was surprised and gave the weakest apology I have ever heard. To give proper credit  a short  white female (that was working in a busser/waiter assistant capacity) was extremely polite. She checked on our table twice and wasn\'t even our server. Everyone else was either black or Hispanic and couldn\'t care less. My friends and I were put in the corner and refused equal treatment. If you are non-white  I absolutely recommend BJs. The food is great and the wait staff will constantly check on you. But if you are white (like myself and two friends)  the wait staff will be slow to take your order  show no interest in your table and spend all of their time slacking off or speaking to other non-white tables. BJs is just another racist business that hates whites."
Tina L.,Las Vegas  NV,91,17,,10/3/2016,5.0,Recently came to BJ's for the first time. The host was so friendly and made conversation with us on the way to our table. Our waitress was awesome & very helpful; you could tell she knew the menu well & was familiar with everything. She even informed us about signing up for the BJ's Reward's program & then getting a free Mini Pizookie! I went to the BJ's in Henderson the next week & was not disappointed there either! One of my new favorite spots.
Vanessa W.,Timberlake Street  Las Vegas  NV,76,13,2,1/12/2017,5.0,Here with a large group and let me say that these stars are earned from our server Jake! He's super incredible and courteous. Thanks  Jake!! Oh  the food is good  the drinks are good  and I'm sure the other servers are cool too
Kevin C.,Seattle  WA,35,25,,12/21/2016,4.0,Nathan is legit the best server in the world. Typical bar/restaurant atmosphere  solid American food.
Jordan M.,Las Vegas  NV,34,3,,7/10/2017,1.0,"This location should have a ""no coloreds"" sign in the window so i know not to enter next time. I walk in was seated fairly quick and so after 20minutes of sitting and no acknowledgement from anyone on a half busy night  i go tell the hostess about the situation  she tells me ""oh im sorry about that"" and acts like she goes to look for help  i go back to sit down thinkin someone is coming to take care of us  WRONG  what i see is the people who were seated 10/15 minutes after me being served  meanwhile i still havent even been acknowledged  that was my cue to leave. I would love to think race wasnt the case but theres no proof of that  there was about 5 black people total there including me & my gf  sadly enough the ""manager"" was black one busser and one bar tender. The manager excuse was that shes sorry and that ""they know better"" very insincere and uncaring. After barely giving two fucks and doing nothing about the situation she said she would love us to stay and eat  i declined w no hesitation. Me and my gf are very polite good people we didnt deserve that kindve treatment  &even during this whole thing were never rude spoke loud at anyone or anything of that magnitude. Sad i had to find out this way"
Yellow D.,New Haven  CT,0,56,13,7/8/2016,5.0,Interesting place directly across the street from the Red Rock casino. We like to avoid eating in casinos are hotels when possible as the quality and the pricing usually isn't good so we sought this place out and we weren't disappointed.we ate there twice in the last two days. Beer and appetizers were great as was the food  it has a pleasant atmosphere highly recommend.
Richard R.,Bradenton  FL,0,12,,7/5/2017,4.0,"Like someone else reviewed  ""another solid meal at B.J.s"".. we live in Summerlin very close to a variety of neighborhood restaurants and go out several nights a week.BJ\'s works for us for a quick  substantial meal. Service is always efficient and friendly  lots of items on the menu  quick to exchange items if they aren\'t to par. Still waiting to get there for the week-end prime rib the staff always raves about\'m"
Bunny G.,The Woodlands  TX,948,1160,3972,5/31/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Redemption! We stopped in for lunch which I recommend since there are less crowds compared to dinner time and it's easier to find a parking spot-which is only one reason I've stayed away.However  on this visit we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated right away. The loud music and TVs are expected and this way you don't have to listen anyone else's conversation but your own.Our waiter was friendly and we ordered up a draft beer and and spicy egg rolls and wow what a presentation! Flavors were all there and this was the perfect starter dish.We split the California burger which was loaded with avocado. We ordered it medium and it was a bit undercooked. The bread was sourdough but they used a sliced version which for me on a burger was a let down since I was expecting a bun. Nonetheless the burger and side of stringy fries was delicious.Overall high return factor.
Nancy C.,Las Vegas  NV,72,69,109,5/8/2017,1.0,So  I walked in with my elderly mother who I'm helping carry her Oxgyen tank. The hostess greeted us I said my father is already here she said he is over there. Now mine you when you walk in from the bright sun light it's dark inside bjs I said to her I can't see where? She was to lazy to move out from behind the counter to take me to my father!!! Than a waitress walked by heard me and she was kind enough to walk us over like wow!!! So I sat down I didn't know my dad ordered his ice tea we where sitting at the table for at lease 4 minutes which isn't long. But a waitress came up to the table and ask if we had been help I said no we haven't with her smart comment said than why is there napkins on your table? I couldn't believe she was so nasty!!! I said I haven't ordered she walked away started talking and laughing at our table. Which was so rude!!! I asked to speak with a manager and never showed at our table!!!
Bobby Y.,Las Vegas  NV,571,353,42,5/20/2015,4.0,"Wow BJ\'s is better - *way* better than I remember. And their happy hour is pretty ridiculously good  too. You\'re even allowed to add up to 8-9 toppings to a happy hour personal pizza ($6-ish) or pick a specialty pizza to represent your pick. What a deal!Super attentive service. Makes you want to invest in a franchise  but all of these are corporate-owned  just like Panda Express is. That must the secret to consistency and stellar  no-excuses service! Our drinks (iced tea  beer and more beer) were never down to a 1/3rd of a glass. :)It\'s no wonder this is many people\'s ""favorite restaurant"" when asked to state one. I certainly wouldn\'t want to be the Olive Garden next door (which does well  too) or any other establishment sharing the same parking lot.If you haven\'t tried BJ\'s in a long time  go. Certainly go instead of to Grimaldi\'s or to the Cheesecake Factory or even to Dom DeMarco\'s pizzeria for that matter. It\'s just so spot on it\'s hard not to compare. Everything that comes out of their kitchen is super solid  and they won\'t hesitate to make things right if they\'re not!"
Peaches D.,Las Vegas  NV,284,140,335,6/30/2014,3.0,Ate here for dinner today and for some reason it was super busy. I really love this restaurant and have been coming here for a long time. I love the ambiance and the food is great. I love their signature pizookie's and their rootbeer. Our waitress was not at all coordinated. She was in over her head I think because it was so busy. It took 15 minutes after we were seated for her to come by and ask what we would like to drink. Then it took another 20 minutes for her to actually come back to give us our drinks. This made me mad since I've never had such poor service at this restaurant before. We ordered 2 appetizers which came out literally 5 minutes before we were served out entrees. On top of that our waitress was not really attentive to us and was kind of rude when we asked for sauces and other things. Overall  I still love this restaurant  but I believe that if they do become busy the waitress/waiters should not neglect their tables and not be snippy if ketchup or other things are needed.
Annemarie K.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,137,378,511,4/27/2016,3.0,I have been here a few times and I would have to say that overall my experiences have been good. The service is normally fast and friendly. They have a menu with a wide variety of cuisine. There is a wide variety of beers available and a good specialty mixed drink selection. I would have to say that the food at times is hit or miss. I tried to deep dish pizza  and it was soggy in the middle. A few more minutes in the oven would have done it more justice.
Gene A.,Las Vegas  NV,2,22,,10/14/2016,3.0,I was disappointed with the smoked hickory barbecue sandwich. Nowhere in the menu description was there mention that the base ingredient is a hamburger patty. The brisket was layered on top of the patty with bacon. When a sandwich is called smoked brisket  I would not expect it to taste like hamburger.
Shawn J.,Henderson  NV,449,792,202,4/23/2015,1.0,There are hundreds of place one can go in Las Vegas and have lunch in under an hour. This BJ's location is not one of them. When it takes 13 minutes to order a Coke or iced tea  then after another 15 minutes nobody has bothered to even stop by and ask if you wanted to order anything to actually eat  that's a problem. It shows that the staff and management is not in tune with their customer's needs  and after 35 minutes of only seeing one server at our table I got up and left. Thankfully there was a Taco Bell down the street that even with 7 cars stacked up in the drive through was able to get me in and out in under 10 minutes. I took someone out for lunch intending to give them a nice change from their lunch routine but the inattentive staff at this BJ's location ruined that idea. 1 Star. There's really no excuse for this kind of stupidity by the management team.
Nathan B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,14,,6/24/2017,5.0,Great food  service and price. The food is always good and the price isn't bad at all. Good casual dining!
Alessandra O.,Las Vegas  NV,0,9,,1/13/2017,4.0,I love BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. It is always my go to when I am indecisive about where to eat. There is a large selection of food on the menu... anything from seafood  steak  to vegetarian items. There is rarely ever a long wait even when it is busy and everything comes out fresh. No matter where I may be traveling in the nation  this restaurant is always reliable with great service and food when I am unsure of where to go. Never had a bad experience here  great service.
Jillian P.,Las Vegas  NV,134,254,925,7/15/2014,5.0,Although there is usually a wait if you go during the peek times and days  it's worth it. I usually get their amazing honey crisp chop chicken salad and it is always consistently made  no surprises. That goes with their whole menu. Obviously their pizza is made to perfection  that's a given. So someone at the table has to order a pizza! But please  for the love of god  SAVE ROOM FOR A PIZZOOKIE!!! What's that  you ask? It's a hot giant cookie  still warm in its mini pizza pan  with a heaping scoop of ice cream on top  just waiting to be devoured! You can say you'll only have one bite  but you would be lying. I double-dare you to only have one bite. When a table gets a Pizzookie  it's like watching a pack of starving wolves being thrown a juicy steak. First come  first serve!
Amy S.,Riverton  Salt Lake City  UT,6,22,6,5/3/2016,4.0,Had dinner here last night. This was my second time dining at BJ's and first time at this specific location. I went with my tried and true favorite- Ahi Tuna Pok  served with these amazing crisp chips and avocado. Honestly  the Pok here is worth making the drive for alone. It very closely mirrors the quality of what I've experienced in Maui. After sharing that  I order the Cherry Glazed Salmon to go. Both were amazing.The restaurant is in between casual and formal. The bar is well-stocked  and the ambience is really nice. The place is fairly dimly lit  but just enough so you can still see your dining mates and your plate. We only had to wait 15-20 minutes for a booth  but once we were seated  we didn't have any servers checking on us for another 20 minutes  which we weren't thrilled about. I think that other than being pretty short-staffed  it's a pretty great place.
Tracy S.,Las Vegas  NV,48,47,87,5/11/2016,4.0,We come to this location often. The service both at the bar and tables are always good. They had a special going on. 2 for $25. It was a choice of salad or soup for each person (2 people) medium pizza and a pizookie. Such a great deal. Not sure how long it lasts. Will be back soon!
Rex M.,Richardson  TX,1206,192,2315,3/25/2015,5.0,"Always the right choice......Because Feast Buffet at the tony and electric Red Rock Resort & Casino had a line out the door  I went to one of my reliable favorites. But in beautiful Summerlin!Because it was a late lunch  it was not very crowded and I was seated immediately in a plush booth.What a relief. No crowds and a restful and restorative dining area with the myriad of flat screen TV\'s kept at just the right volume for conversation when making new friends.The lunch special of a deep dish meat extravaganza pizza and salad were an ideal choice. The pizza was so hot I had to wait for it to cool. Still  an abundance of stretchy cheese with every slice.The salad was not a wimpy small afterthought. It was a dinner-plate of fresh tomato\'s  black olives  field greens  sweet red onion  hot-house cucumbers and field greens topped with a refreshing vinaigrette. Service was five star. My handsome young waiter had just moved from Colorado and was a delight to talk with. He recommended sampling the root-beer. Had no idea it was made in-house  but I had three frosty mugs of it plus a to-go glass.Just a small cat here  so was not able to finish all the food and there was no refrigerator in my suite at The Palazzo. Bygones.Going back to my second home of Summerlin/Henderson/Las Vegas about seven times a year I always put this BJ\'s on my food ""bucket-list"". So very Summerlin!Highly recommended!"
Brent V.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,53,5,1,11/18/2016,5.0,Great staff who provide excellent service. Has a great group of friendly regular guests. Bathrooms could use an upgrade.
Diana A.,Sunny Isles Beach  FL,36,19,6,11/7/2016,5.0,First time going to this restaurant and it was great! I would definitely go again! I like the ambiance as well and they brew their own root beer for those who like it!
Christie L.,Las Vegas  NV,1057,837,6538,3/1/2014,4.0,"I always get flyers in the mail for BJ\'s  but for whatever reason hadn\'t ever tried it until now. The inside appeared clean and I was greeted and helped right away. The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn\'t too hungry so I just ordered a ""Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad"" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price  but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion  tomato  mozzarella  basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a ""Kids Pizza"" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy! They offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program."
Je S.,Valparaiso  IN,0,18,1,11/27/2016,4.0,This place seems to be the spot we always stop at when we get into town which is every other month. Prices are reasonable  wide variety on menu  appetizers  soups  salads  sandwiches  entrees and good wine/beer list. The staff is always friendly  the place is typically busy  we never have to wait more than 15 minutes which is nice. One of my favs is the BBQ chicken chopped salad....the thin french fried onions on too make it so good! Good place for a date  meeting a friend  family dinner or to watch a sports game.
Jessica M.,Harrison Township  MI,111,97,76,1/26/2016,5.0,Wow. Really impressed. This is a chain restaurant? My dad and step mom took myself and kids here after a long day of planes  walking and driving. I was famished and would have devoured anything put in front of me.First of all  very nice space. Cozy  yet spacious. Modern  but comfortable. Our server was Xavier and he was delightful. We were taken care of at precisely the right pace. The flow of our meal was perfect  even for my overly-impatient father!Drinks came out quickly  my son ordered the house-made root beer and I stole a sip. Very good! My iced tea was fine and everyone else enjoyed theirs. Xavier made sure to refill my kids' drinks  and asking first if they could have more soda! Much appreciated. My step mom had a coupon for a free app so we chose the avocado egg rolls. We all enjoyed them. 3 whole egg rolls cut into 6 pieces. Just enough to kick off the meal.The menu is huge! It takes a minute to navigate. There is another chain restaurant that has a dessert gimmick (ahem CHEESECAKE) and a very large menu as well. I had a very sub par experience there so the large menu scared me. Glad to see my apprehension was misplaced!Kids meals were modestly priced at 5.99. Both of mine went for the mini corndogs  8 of them! Fries were yummy too!I ordered the tomato bisque and the seared tuna salad. Wow. I have not one criticism and that is quite hard to do! I would eat these things every day if I could. The bowl of soup and the salad were the perfect amount of food  satisfying to the last bite. I usually ask for the dressing on the side  since almost always they drench it down  but theirs was done perfectly. Ingredients were well balanced and fresh. I was also pleased with the price point. $15.99!? I didn't pay  but I was surprised that it wasn't a $19.99 dish.Easy five stars. I wish I was this satisfied with the value  quality of food & service  as well as the overall experience every time I dined out.
Sarah B.,Las Vegas  NV,4,41,50,4/8/2015,4.0,BJs is the place to be! Two words:: HAPPY HOUR 3-7pm Smaller portions but very filling..Sliders & fries: add cheddar cheese & the option of baconLettuce wraps: two sauces in which the mustard one has wasabi I think: SPICYSanta Fe Rolls: adorable small sizes but lots of them with fresh salsa *must haveFlat marg pizza: ok  a bit dry & Blah tastingSpinach Artichoke: please::: order like 2 super delicious & creamy..

He's very nice  informative  & patient :: Us girls talk a lot! He went above & beyond to make sure we had all we wanted/needed..
Martha C.,Las Vegas  NV,1,61,3,11/14/2016,5.0,Their wine here is sooo good! Pizookies  deep dish pizza  salmon with potatoes and asparagus is to die for. Always love coming here staff and service is great as well. Place gets really busy on weekends though
John H.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,12/18/2016,5.0,Just had the Bison Burger and the Margarita Pizza  I have to saw wow delicious  healthy and light. Also had 2 different beers this place specializes in any beer you can think of. I will be back very soon and will recommend. Across the street from the Red Rock Hotel.
Mai V.,Las Vegas  NV,85,85,77,3/23/2016,5.0,I love this place!!! Especially since they added more low carb options and new menu items! The dishes I am recommending so far are the salmon with asparagus and sweet cherry sauce  definitely I am crazy about the honey Sri racha Brussell sprouts  the ahi tuna salad is delicious as well!!! Also I love how they have the BJ rewards program and all the promotions and discounts they offer  which then would justify why I would eat here more than once a week!!! Keep up the good work! A great place where everybody in the family is happy even the kids!
D R.,Las Vegas  NV,48,15,,11/28/2016,5.0,We've been wanting to try this place for a while but my kid would always choose Olive Garden for their soup. This place was family friendly and seemed like a nice place to come at night with friends. Pizza was delicious  drinks were good. The staff greeted us and sat us immediately. Excellent service and staff.
Cherilyn D.,Honomu  HI,4,99,477,2/28/2016,5.0,BJ's has a great variety of food - pizzas (including deep dish)  fish  pork ribs  pastas  and burgers to name a few. Their pazookie dessert is a must try if you love sweets! I'm not a big alcohol drinker  but there is a wide variety of drinks to choose from as well. We normally don't want for a seat in their restaurant area. They have lots of booths and tables in their bar area so we're normally able to find a seat right away.
Ellen C.,Las Vegas  NV,39,195,79,12/20/2014,4.0,As chain restaurants go  this one is pretty good. Nice beer selection  huge food menu  and pretty reasonable prices.My husband and I each had a beer (IPA for him  pale ale for me)  and they were both really good. We split an appetizer of mini bruschetta  which I thought was pretty tasty. (Too much bread-to-topping ratio for my spouse  but he's not really a bread person like me!) He had the pulled pork sandwich  and I had the Asian chopped salad. Yummy fried onions on the sandwich  and the meat was nicely smoked. He was quite pleased! My salad was fine  nothing special  but the portion size was reasonable and thankfully the salad itself was not overdressed.Our waitress was a little overeager  and the back room was a little cold  but otherwise there's not much to complain about. The food was good; the beer was great; and I'm sure we'll be back when we're on that side of town.
Michelle H.,Twin Falls  ID,0,3,,4/19/2017,5.0,The chicken Alfredo was great! Our server  I believe his name was Nathan  was amazing!
L W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,7,,4/16/2017,5.0,We love this place! We go there so much we have favorite waiter and waitress. We love Nate and Taylor (the student). They are so good. We love the food the people. It's so nice!
JOanne A.,Las Vegas  NV,311,413,1241,3/1/2014,4.0,Decent food but sometimes there's a long wait! She's not a huge restaurant but she's big enough. They have an area in the back that you can have a large party.When I was a wedding planner  one of my brides wanted to have their rehearsal dinner here and they fit roughly 25+ people in the back room. It was pretty tight and rather than being sectioned off  it was one long table. It wasn't very comfy but it was good enough for what was needed. Buffet style menu and then drinks were ordered and paid individually. BJ's is very accommodating with their catering options and if they can't  they'll try to take care of ya the best way they can.BJ's is great for a night out to have some drinks and a meal (if you like) to catch up with old friends or a gathering place to be with family. It's low lighting may put you to sleep (as it does for me sometimes) but it assists when you're trying to have a little more intimate/private mean/drink as it makes it harder to see those around you lol.
Oscar B.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,62,85,692,5/14/2016,1.0,"Over the years  we have been happy with BJ.  However today  we had the worst experience ever.  My water glass still have food stain upon delivery. We order a stake medium rare  it came out well done. Request to be returned  the waiter didn\'t even apologize. All he said was ""Do you still want the stake?"" Really nasty attitude!  The Ziti was way too salty. The salad tasted it was left over from last night. The salad was soggy. It\'s a competitive market in this town  the unprofessionalism of the staff plus the cleanliness just doesn\'t work for me."
Susan H.,Las Vegas  NV,160,162,318,1/11/2016,2.0,I was NOT happy about paying for brisket burger with hardly any brisket basically none it was more of a flavored spread. No waiting area (what's called the greedy design) so everyone waiting is standing near those trying to eat! Servers asking you to please move so they can get by. No double doors the cold wind blowing in... My boyfriend liked his food but I wasn't impressed and with drinks (just beer) and our meal it was about 80.00!! Word of advice the happy hour ends at 7 but if you barely get off work and make it there at 630 like me you'll miss happy hour waiting in the way for 30 min plus!
Alicia B.,Montgomery  AL,134,103,73,8/16/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I wish i could give 4 1/2 stars.......I got a coupon from Facebook for 50% off a large deep dish pizza  you can't beat that!! So we headed up there tonight.Now we come here often it's our go to place when we don't know what we want and I love it! However  I decided to get the BJ's favorite pizza tonight and its the most bland pizza I have ever had. (Which is why I knocked off a star this time) Pepperoni  sausage  mushrooms  peppers  and onions were on the pizza. These can be bold flavors but tonight it wasn't there. I will stick to the BBQ chicken pizza if we get pizza again! Service as always was outstanding! Our dessert took 20 mins so the manager came out to take it off our bill  which was very nice!
Lauren M.,Las Vegas  NV,45,136,19,11/25/2015,1.0,I used to love coming to bjs. I recently came here with my family and I'm not sure if our server was too busy but I had to ask him for a kids menu three times. Ok no big deal. We ordered appetizers. Waited waited  finally our main corse got there. I asked him where the appetizers went. Oh he forgot to ring them in. Uhm really ok. Then I got my balsamic chicken  my favorite. The chicken was horrible. It was rubbery and tasted disgusting. Worst chicken u have ever had. I will never go back here again. So many other restaurants that have better service and better food.
Barbara B.,Las Vegas  NV,23,19,18,8/5/2016,5.0,perfect place for family and friends to enjoy a good meal together  only negatives is slower service then what I gave when I waited tables. I was trained to greet your table within 5 to 10 minutes it was roughly 20. also the manager didn't know the sisters to the yelp questions when I checked in. food is so good it's worth the small wait.
Laurie H.,Las Vegas  NV,299,450,256,9/3/2015,5.0,I LOVE. BJ's. Think it will be the family go-to. The offer Gluten Free Pizza  a little pricey as it comes with cheese only  every topping after that is $1. Making a small pizza close to $20. It is good  everything our large party ordered was very good. The drinks are cold one was an Irish Rootbeer  tasted like Rootbeer  only made out alcohol. The shits were cold  my Sparkling Strawberry Lemonade Was delicious.  As it was my birthday dinner I had a coupon for a free Pizookie  which is a giant chocolate chip cookie pizza. They made mine GF  and didn't charge an up charge. They come with ice cream on top. Our server Chanel brought us extra ice cream! Without us asking! Very nice touch. The atmosphere is upbeat and a little loud  perfect for when Kayden wasn't happy. Several tvs on  and drinking people  all led to a family feel. Parking lot plenty large  patio area perfect for walking a fussy baby. 12 thumbs up!
Jessica K.,Las Vegas  NV,3,10,,1/31/2017,2.0,Never had a horrible experience while dining in and their food is amazing. One of my favorite places to go get burgers and pasta. But whenever I order takeout online (which I do A LOT more often than dining in)  EVERY single time they always forget one or more items! I'm not even being dramatic. It's literally every single time. Whether it's utensils  ingredients  sauces  sides  etc. For example  I ordered three burgers tonight. One of the burgers didn't come with onions when we added it online  only one burger came with a side of ranch when I specifically added three  they didn't add as much bleu cheese on the second burger than they normally do  and only gave us forks when I asked for take out utensils. Another time they forgot two sides of our fries. There has been more experiences of them not fulfilling my order  but those are just some examples. I order their burgers the most out of the rest of the menu and I kid you not  every time I go in to pick it up  they always ask me what fries I want when I always put it in online. I don't know if there's something wrong with the website or what  but as a busy person  it's annoying to have to wait. They're not even apologetic. I always tip well because I'm a hostess/takeout person myself  but the fact that they've always forgotten a part of my order and have me wait makes me not want to tip them at all. I don't know how they do it at BJ's  but at the restaurant I work at (which is a very big  chain restaurant that is very similar to BJ's)  I pack everything (sauces  entrees  desserts  sides  etc.) and check everything twice to make sure I have everything. So either they do it differently at BJ's or the takeout specialist doesn't know how read and check the order. This really makes me not want to order takeout from BJ's anymore.
Greg A.,San Diego  CA,112,25,1,9/19/2016,5.0,Love the food  love the service. They have the best kale and Cajun shrimp salad. Pizooki is to die for  and most like will get a heart attack from the decadent density of the chocolate. But free birthday dinners and great rewards program.
Robert C.,Deer Park  WA,5,263,,1/29/2017,5.0,Seems like this is always good ... we will return ... we try to eat here every time we are in town
Paul H.,Las Vegas  NV,329,548,656,8/22/2015,5.0,I have been here several times. We have eaten chicken Parmesan  southern fried chicken  sirloin steak  and the Ribeye. Each and every time the meals are prepared properly and the food is delightful. The cheddar mashed potatoes are a must have. The kids have enjoyed the kids menu items and the pazookies are a wonderful dessert. This is definitely a value to the neighborhood and a regular eating spot.
Imafood E.,Las Vegas  NV,9,136,15,12/29/2015,4.0,They have an amazing turkey burger here. I added cheese to it and it was delicious! Very good service and reasonable prices too.
Lehua M.,Las Vegas  NV,12,8,6,4/6/2015,5.0,Perfect atmosphere for casual dining. Considering I went around lunch time  we were seated right away and our server was excellent  very attentive! I definitely recommend the avocado egg rolls that come with a delicious dipping sauce  and the juicy stuffed mushrooms as starters. For lunch I had the BBQ Chicken Salad but I substituted the chicken for blackened salmon and it was prepared just right! Also  if you're totally stuffed but you have a sweet tooth... They make scrumptious mini versions of their pazokies  its just the right portion workout pushing you over the edge. This would be a great place for happy hour with all the different TV's and the fully stocked bar.
Pamela F.,Round Mountain  NV,0,14,1,2/9/2017,4.0,first time here  had the shrimp and arugula pita tacos and seasoned fries with there harvest hefeweizen wheat beer  awesomely good. good atmosphere. will come again.
Vanessa A.,Las Vegas  NV,259,670,174,10/23/2014,3.0,I came twice for food and once for the root beer.They have a happy hour from 2-5 (double check that's the exact hours)It includes food and drinks. Menu for HH is limited but they have one.I got a growler when I was at beer fest  so I came here and for $8.00  you get a growler of fresh root beer.It was delicious  however  I wish it had a little more bubbles. The taste was spot on  but I like the fizzyness the bubbles bring.
Jane K.,Las Vegas  NV,54,167,201,9/30/2016,2.0,Food was okay  not great  but it's kind of like bar food  so you can't expect much. The service was great  until the bill came out. He said he would be back for our change and never came back. Okay  then he came back and said he will be right back. Great! I waited another 10 min as everyone else is getting their checks and leaving. By this time we have waited about 30 minutes total for our change. I would have given him all of our change  but it was the principal  knowing the change exceeds the 20% and expecting more than that. So  we asked if we can get our change back. He says  oh  you wanted your change back?He was a bit surprised. Not sure why he was surprised when he said  he would be back for our change. When he came back to give us our change  he didn't give us all of it back. I still left him 20% tip  but I was bit irritated that I had to ask for the change back and not get all of it back. Hence the 2 stars for trying to take my money.
Michael P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,14,1,8/29/2016,3.0,Lot's of changes at this place. Pizza seemed totally different and very bready!! The new checkout system takes too long and the staff gets confused.
Angie S.,Anaheim  CA,1,4,,2/2/2017,1.0,Worst service ever. Waited for over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. Definitely going down hill.
Ania K.,Las Vegas  NV,2510,428,5909,9/6/2014,4.0,This is a regular stop for us because it's consistent and near our house. They offer very filling food with good flavors & it's good to have a chilled glass of beer once in a while. We always order the BBQ chicken pizza & a small favorite starter are the corn fritters. It's a very busy location so be prepared to wait if you come during peak hours. There are tv's everywhere so ladies don't come for romance reasons :)
Jamie M.,Las Vegas  NV,121,98,96,12/11/2015,5.0,Chanel's service was 5 star  good fast food! Love the Brussels sprouts with Sriracha sauce and have it on every visit!
Sandra G.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,,1/26/2017,1.0,Disappointed with the service-had gone here on a Saturday night around 10:20pm. Service was horrible as there were maybe 10 people in the bar/restaurant area total.  It took us forever to even get our salads-as we asked the waitress while she planning on walking right by us after sitting there just waiting & waiting-she then walked right into the back & seconds later came out with them (obviously they had been there for some time). Our pizza was uncooked & we seemed to be more of a hassle to our waitress than a customer.  I since have contacted the corporate office by e-mail with no return & also verbally left a message on the corporate number with no return  this is definitely bad customer service on many levels.
Christine O.,Las Vegas  NV,0,20,39,4/26/2015,4.0,Good service  attentive wait staff. Good food with the usual huge American portions. Reading some of the other reviews  everybody else has pretty much covered it. I'll post some pictures though. I agree it's a good place to go  it's super casual  a little bit loud for the music for my taste  but I think it's for younger people.Huge selections of beer as you would expect in a brewhouse  large selection of wines and mixed drinks. Adequate food choices from dinners to. pizzas  salads  appetizers  everything was good. We got the corn fritter appetizer  very nice.
Brianna L.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,205,110,64,3/31/2016,4.0,Love bjs! Great food and love the beer selection! We like the poke app and like the buffalo chicken pizza! Also we like coming for lunch for there unlimited soup and salad! Tasty tasty! And only for 8 bucks! Last but not least is the famous pazooki!! Our favorite is the Oreo!! Also the new monkey bread is pretty good too! Overall good meal and good prices!
Karissa G.,Las Vegas  NV,87,3,,8/8/2016,5.0,Really good food with a great variety on the menu. The healthy options are good  but the best thing is definitely the pizookie. Warm and gooey deep dish cookie topped with ice cream melting all over? It's even better than it sounds. Trust me  the pizookie does not disappoint!
Rachel V.,Las Vegas  NV,138,33,4,12/28/2015,5.0,Hands down  best Hefeweizen! Whenever I'm in the mood for a fresh. enjoyable brew  this is my GO TO. Great Bar area as well!Perfect place for Happy hour! I'd recommend the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls as well!And of course their Pizookie is on fire always!
Rabea A.,Los Angeles  CA,3,9,3,9/18/2016,3.0,Food was ok  nothing to come back for.. service should be more professional.. Xavier was rude
T L.,Las Vegas  NV,4,102,11,3/18/2016,1.0,What happened? Bjs is no longer our go to family restaurant. Service is so slow and unprofessional. Took so long for our server to even acknowledge our party. We had to track down a manager to request some service. Even after we got our food  we never saw our server again....until the check came. Shameful. Food was ok but not good enough to make up for poor service. Too bad. We'll miss coming here. There are many more options were we can spend our money and get better service.
Kimberly D.,Henderson  NV,1,25,3,7/6/2016,5.0,Been here a few times..always had a good time with good food. Tonight my fianc and I sat at the bar and ordered two alcoholic drinks  avo egg rolls appetizer and the pizooki dessert with 3 pizookis (yum). Food was awesome and service was great. Bartender was Tracey  and she was very friendly!
Monica D.,Las Vegas  NV,571,433,65,6/12/2014,4.0,I recently had lunch here (I'd been here before for drinks and also for a work dinner)  and BJ's did not disappoint. Every experience I've had at BJ's has been perfectly pleasant. They were very busy at lunchtime  but we were seated promptly. Our server was very friendly and attentive as well. I really appreciated the variety of lunch specials! There were lots of choices  from pizza to salads  to entrees. I got the BBQ platter  which came with a BBQ pork slider  a BBQ chicken breast  cole slaw and fries. The chicken was juicy and tasty. The slider was also pretty tasty  just messy. BJ's is a great Summerlin option for lunch. Casual and low key!
Emily R.,Las Vegas  NV,1755,1640,10503,10/15/2012,2.0,I've never been a huge fan of BJ's restaurants. They seem to offer all my favorite things  beer and food  but the place has never really grown on me. On this occasion  I shared a half buffalo chicken and half sweet pig pizza. I enjoy the texture of the pan pizza  but they no longer serve them in the pan  which was a disappointment. Maybe they were just a little too heavy for the servers to carry  but man they really helped keep the pizza warm and the presentation was better. Now they serve them on a plate and it just wasn't the same. I didn't really enjoy either pizza flavor either. I've had both before and they were ok  but this time I was completely underwhelmed. The pizza just didn't seem warm and gooey enough to make up for the lack of flavor either. I did enjoy my unsweetened tropical iced tea. I'm always happy when places offer other varieties of unsweetened tea. The service was ok as well. Our server was friendly  but she wasn't very quick with the refills  so we sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I would have liked.Overall  it's not my favorite restaurant chain  but it does in a pinch. I just haven't found the menu item of my dreams here yet.
Cody T.,Reno  NV,11,31,4,8/8/2015,5.0,BJs is a classic. Everyone knows Bjs  this is one of those places you go to after a football  basketball  game or your little sisters recital. Place is delicious and satisfying! The pizookies are so good you let the ice cream melt in your mouth like ice cubes! The burgers are flame flame. The juicyness and the flavor zaps your taste buds like an alien zapping you to outer space! The pasta is nothing but delicious! Don't forget the beer! The finest beers of all the land man they're good!Great place to eat!
Marco G.,Las Vegas  NV,83,77,64,5/10/2016,4.0,First of all I'm not sure why I couldn't find this place on Yelp while I was there. Had to google it then locate it. Anyways... Came here for dinner and can't really go wrong here. Had a beer sampler and they had a 25 dollar special for 2 so my fianc and I had it. It included either a soup or salad and a medium deep dish pizza along with their famous pizookie. Everything was delicious and our server was wonderful. This place normally doesn't get too crowded and the wait is very minimal. Will def be a regular here.
Scott P.,Las Vegas  NV,677,170,86,4/9/2014,5.0,I have two words for you: pi-zookieIn certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options  none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone .All that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However  for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through  very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key. In closing- PI ZOOKIE MOFO
Victoria Q.,New York  NY,1378,133,573,3/26/2014,4.0,Bj's food is comparable to chili's...not great but definitely not bad. How they set themselves apart from the list of mediocre food establishments is their service. I have never had a bad experience at any Bj's locations. The staff is so helpful and attentive. I've come during happy hours and peak dinner hours and have always received great service. And even though nothing that I've ever ordered from Bj's has ever stood out to me  I have to acknowledge that they have put together a very extensive menu together for their guests. Their is a dish for everyone in your party.They have a great beer selection... a variety of in house and craft brews for you to choose from. Their cocktails are also great...especially the watermelon mojito.Bj's is a great neighborhood spot to go to if there is one in your area.
Nicholas W.,Las Vegas  NV,169,226,195,4/15/2015,4.0,The best BJs in Vegas! They are always packed full but super fast. I've never had a bad experience at this location and make it a point to stop by when on the west side of town because the pizza is so good. The sweet pig is the way to go!
James M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,3,7/4/2016,2.0,Lousy host ! Check in at 2 pm no menu presented and just send you to the table.. Sat for 5 minutes  the server lack of acknowledgement  went to a table next to me 3 times no greetings what so ever.. I Ordered lunch especial  a cup of soup that was so so.. Instead of a cup I was given a bowl... Then3 minutes later entree comes..Really!! It's 4th of July half of the room was empty... Service can be rendered better..Service at BJ's on South Eastern in Henderson Is far better and well executed..
Chad C.,Las Vegas  NV,0,27,8,6/26/2016,3.0,Food was ok this time   service was alittle slow being not busy. Everyone was nice though.
Adam S.,Las Vegas  NV,30,17,2,5/11/2015,1.0,3rd time going. All 3 times the food was not very good. Party of 8 and all of us agreed no more going back. Maybe they're known for something that we haven't tried yet.On a side note. The lay out is pretty bad too. Where we were sitting it was so tight we had to keep moving our seat in and out to let people and waiters go by. Not a very enjoyable experience at all.
Katie Y.,Las Vegas  NV,19,63,58,6/7/2015,4.0,Pretty consistent with their food  great lunch specials and happy hour specials.  Love their pizookie dessert  it's the absolute best but don't count on vanilla ice cream being available on Sunday nights because their delivery comes on Monday :-( If you tend to get chilly like me  make sure to bring a sweater because the AC is always on blast. :-)
Avner M.,Henderson  NV,2608,531,34,7/18/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,1pm & the service is not very good today...been here for a good 5 minutes  the waiter came to take our drink order  10 minutes & he has not come back  REALLY??? 2 waters  3 ice teas???At the 15 mark drinks finally came  orders taken. Now sitting  drinks empty???Food finally came and order is wrong??? The manager came over apologized  offered to get the sandwich made over but we said no as we waited almost 45 minutes just to get food. Also ha to ask the manage for drink refills which were brought by another person.Now 2pm  the place is almost empty  drink is empty  waiter came by but no acknowledgement. Our waiter  has a great personality but as for attention to detail  not very good. Had to ask for another ice tea.Not sure why it is so bad today???
Uriel G.,Las Vegas  NV,95,4,1,2/27/2015,1.0,We went to this restaurant for dinner and had a bad experience all around. First  we waited a long long time (about 15 minutes) for the waiter. We had to go ask another waiter. When we finally order our burgers  the food take for ever to come to our table. It was almost like a nightmare. So  I asked for my burger medium cooked  right?  well they didn't just over cooked it  they burned it  it testad like charcoal. We didn't complain  we just are not coming back. why  there ara a lot of good options in Summerlin area.By the way  the restaurante was not busy at all.
Dejan L.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,8/20/2016,5.0,Awesome restaurant and awesome servers! Deep dish pizza is amazing! Kids have to try Mac 'n' cheese from the kids menu. And what to say about our server Ariana... I am 10 years in hospitality  I've never met better server in my life! I just can't decide if food is better or service! Definitely going back soon!
Racer X.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,0,22,11,4/23/2015,4.0,We took the kids here for dinner on a Thursday night at 7pm. It was packed  but we were seated rather quickly. Service was great  and the food was excellent! The waiters didn't seem to wear name tags  but our server Humberto did great  even though he seemed over worked.
Ken G.,Las Vegas  NV,103,15,20,4/10/2015,5.0,Excellent service and the food is delicious. Every time I come here I try something new and so far have not been disappointed yet. I had the ribs and let me tell you! It will be a travesty if you go there and not treat yourself. It's worth it. Trust me. Thumbs up for BJ's.
Shaolin W.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,6/12/2016,5.0,BJ's has been my favorite kick back restaurant for years! Today's experience reminded me why I love them. The food was great and service was amazing!!
Tk D.,Las Vegas  NV,11,13,,11/11/2016,2.0,"Where do I begin .......This particular BJ\'s is always busy and not only did we have to wait 30 min (they said 20) but once a booth became open in the bar area we had to flag down a waitress to clear off the table (several walked past us without even acknowledging the dirty table but upon observation I noticed a plethora of others had to do the same thing ) once the table was cleaned I notice we had the same waitress as the last time and I was like ohhh joy (did you catch the sarcasm ) nevertheless I ordered my usual ""Cadillac margarita NO salt (this time I had to say NOOO salt so she can hear me since the last time she screwed it up) wellllllll this time was NOOOOO different she brings my drink out with NOOOO salt and I drink it and welp this time it had no salt but she brought me a grapefruit margarita no salt....after that once again she became sarcastic because of her error... we also ordered two pizookies and had a coupon for a free one  she took the information and 15 min later out comes 1 pizookie  soooooo im writing this to say Nicole N you may need to get your hearing checked because everything we ordered you brought what we didn\'t ordered (or what you thought you heard )......"
Jess H.,Las Vegas  NV,0,10,12,10/27/2015,4.0,So yummy  I had the California chicken sandwich and it was delicious. And my husband had the country fried chicken  and it was pretty good too. So juicy! And the crafted cream soda was really tasty  I just wish the drinks were colder
Cerise B.,Las Vegas  NV,45,90,106,9/2/2015,4.0,I usually enjoy the food here  but the southern fried chicken I ordered was seasoned with way too much salt (and I love salt!). My husband ordered mozzarella sticks and buffalo chicken flatbread  which were both very good. The service was excellent  as usual.
Clint B.,Las Vegas  NV,760,1113,4735,4/4/2012,3.0,The number one reason to come here is the pizookie. Sure  it's something that I can easily make at home  but I'm way too lazy. It came out in a fairly large (maybe 5-6 inches in diameter) metal dish. In it  a piping hot  moist and chewy chocolate chip cookie at least a quarter inch thick and topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's simple but when you combine two classics like cookies and ice cream it's a sure fire way to make me drool. It's large enough for three people to share  but my son and I managed to devour it quickly between the two of us.The other food is pretty standard. They've got a big menu that'll make you think you're at the Cheesecake Factory. Full of items not high in quality of preparation or ingredients  but large enough to appease any hearty appetite.The pot roast sandwich may not be good for the heart  but it's good for the soul -- slices of beef on top of toasted garlic bread. If that wasn't enough they top it off with mashed potatoes and gravy. Some random veggies on the side might fool others into believing it's healthier than it is. The wife went with a classic burger. Standard fare  but it hit the spot.The place is great for families. It's loud enough to drown out the sounds of restless toddlers and plenty of tv's to distract you from the average food and service. The kid's menu is full of all the usual stuff -- chicken tenders  grilled cheese  burgers  etc. So  chances are there's something for even the pickiest eater.3.5 Stars
Brian W.,Las Vegas  NV,545,31,37,2/3/2016,5.0,I've always liked BJ's brewery. They have great food selection at a reasonable price. Today I enjoyed a salmon and broccoli lunch very tasty very healthy. I also like the fact that they offer many gluten free options even their desserts come in gluten-free options. Highly recommend.
Matt T.,Las Vegas  NV,78,342,,1/22/2016,3.0,My Dad and I ate lunch in here today. And it was a mixed bag. He had the Margherita Flatbread  which he said was great and it looked good. I had a Chicken Pesto Sandwich. It had Pesto  Roasted Red Bell Peppers  Grilled Chicken  and I got the garlic aioli on the side. And it comes with a side salad. The salad was great. It had some sort of citrus vinegar dressing. I really enjoyed that. However  there was something in the sandwich that set my mouth on fire. I don't know if they put jalapenos in the pesto  but something was extremely spicy. I could only eat half the sandwich. And there wasn't a whole lot of chicken on it. We each had some of the house root beer  which is excellent. The service was also good and it was very clean in there. I'd definitely eat here again  however I'm staying away from the Chicken Pesto Sandwich. The other downside is that they share a parking lot with two other restaurants and when it is peak eating hours  it can be brutal trying to find parking or dodge bad drivers.
Jonathan O.,Las Vegas  NV,6,9,2,4/24/2016,5.0,My family and I LOVE BJ's! The food is amazing  and my only complaint is the wait time...but that's a good indicator of how good the place is!
Gracie F.,Dana Point  CA,63,89,35,1/22/2015,5.0,Who DOESN'T love BJs?? Great food  never a long wait even when there is a line...cheerful staff and a game playing on TV. I LOVE the flatbread pizzas!! Try them all!
Nicholas N.,North Hollywood  CA,0,14,8,4/2/2016,1.0,I really don't know what was going on but we had horrible service. They took my name at the front after being ignored for a bit  and no it wasn't busy at all. They finally called my name within a short period (only good thing that night  but wait there's more!) and walked our party of 3 to our table  though it seemed like they didn't know where to even seat us in a half empty restaurant  mind you. Well we sat down at a table finally and waited for 30 minutes. No one offered us a drink or greeted us or anything. Maybe we forgot to take our invisible cloaks off or something. I guess they didn't want our business. Because even after complaining (respectfully)  they didn't seem like they cared at all. So here I am now across the street at Yard House with amazing service and food  writing this review.
Anik G.,Las Vegas  NV,13,30,123,7/11/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Great environment n vibe!! Jared B was my server. Although he forgot my to bring my drink that I ordered with my food I gotta give him 5 stars cuz he has a great personality n very friendly. I have been here a couple times but didn't get a server with a great vibe n playful like today. Food was great n drinks cold as I expected. I had a great time today!
Jimmie W.,Las Vegas  NV,133,23,138,6/2/2015,4.0,I like this place   the pasta's are good and the cheeseburgers are the bomb and dessert are the bomb . Can't go wrong
Jon N.,Las Vegas  NV,1,47,22,4/26/2016,1.0,Sat down @ 6:52    ask waitress for 2 beers happy hour she looked at her phone said sorry it's 7:01.... I told her we were here but waiting till now.. She could not honor the happy hour price  I come her 2-3 times a week.. Just had catering done for work.. Not a happy camper.. We were here before 7:00. Management needs to look at this policy.
Hazel M.,Las Vegas  NV,269,43,59,12/26/2013,4.0,LUNCH FOR TWO.First off our server forgot to give us straws with our water  but when he brought water to an older couple next to us he did not forget to give them straws or a cup of water filled with new ice. Our water looked like it's been sitting out for a while because the ice was almost melted. & when they brought out our clam chowder they forgot to bring out crackers with it & it took forever to flag someone down for it.Did I mention it was my boyfriend's birthday? It was a nice that they brought out a dessert for him  but they brought it out when I was in the bathroom. I mean  couldn't you wait a little bit until I came back out? He was sitting by himself with the damn dessert & a lit candle on it! (he didn't want to blow it out until I came back.)Lastly  I usually get the jambalaya because it's one of the best I've had but today I tried the grilled chicken pasta & to my disappointment  it was totally bland.I understand my boyfriend & I are young but that's no excuse to give us poor service. We still left the waiter 20%  undeservingly.I only bumped it up an extra star because I usually come here & I never had a bad experience until today...on my boyfriends birthday. Such a shame.
Nina N.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,97,8,7,12/4/2014,1.0,I can say that I will never eat here again. I'm so disappointed in the quality of food that I ordered here. I get having char marks on your food but my steak was so burnt that I felt sick from the first bite. I went back to get a new order and it's STILL burnt. They need to get a new grill cook or something because this was horrible!
Jeremy W.,Honolulu  HI,40,22,1,9/13/2015,2.0,The food was decent  but the service wasn't. We ordered the orange glazed salmon w/ asparagus and the chicken pitas. I would give the food a B. It was brought to our table without much wait.Our waiter was not real attentive and messed up our dessert order. He brought our bill before we received our dessert and we noticed he ordered the wrong dessert and asked him to make sure we received the correct dessert. Shortly after  the manager came to our table and apologized for the mix up with our dessert.We ended up waiting an extended time to receive the correct dessert  which was fairly tasty (macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream on top). The waiter took our bill and cashed us out and never apologized for the dessert issue  even though he or the manager took it off our bill. Kinda sad that the waiter didn't take advantage of an opportunity to apologized and let us know they comped the dessert because of the mistake.
Rebecca G.,Scottsdale  AZ,0,2,,10/16/2016,5.0,Our server  Brian  provided the best service we've ever had at a restaurant. He went above & beyond and was excellent!
Steffen D.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,0,3,,9/22/2016,3.0,"As usual for this location  the service was good  but the food is slipping. We ordered the poke appetizer and it tasted fishy and ""off"". We sent it back. I ordered the late nite burger and the cheese was not melted and the chili verde was lukewarm at best. I\'m beginning to think the corporate overlords are ruining an otherwise good place  taking great ideas and doing them halfway. The beer is still good though. That\'s brings it up to a 3"
Amanda B.,Las Vegas  NV,494,325,324,9/15/2013,1.0,Yuck! Worst meal I have had in a long time. The entire experience was bad. I walked in t this restaurant and was greeted by a nasty hostess who had the worst attitude. What a B*&$%!!! I had to complain and the manager came right over and apologized right away. Ordered the Potato Skins for the app. Since when do you deep fry potato skins? These were deep fried with no cheese  bacon or green onion. Just plain with sour cream sauce. Blah  gross!Next up came the meal. The BF ordered the BBQ Beef Sandwich with coleslaw. It was so bad he could not even choke it down. Usually he can eat anything  so this had to be bad. He said it was the worst tasting sandwich he had ever had. Mine was the Angel Hair Pasta that I have ordered several times here and it is usually good. The chef didn't drain the noodles so the bottom of the bowl was full of water  there was no sauce at all  just a few canned tomatoes and trust me  all I could taste was the metal from the can and a half of teaspoon of feta. This went back immediately. They brought me a bowl of their famous clam chowder to replace the pasta. Hahahah-- famous clam chowder?? You have got to be kidding me. The only good thing was the beer that we had. They have their October Fest beer now and of course their famous Jeremiah Red. Funny how they are famous for so many things. NOT!!!
Karen M.,Phoenix  AZ,187,503,832,2/6/2014,4.0,"I\'m pleasantly surprised by how good my food was here and how nice the servers were. On previous visits  my food was lackluster and service matched that ambivalence. Hubby and I wanted some calories NOW as we just finished a gnarly hike an hour prior. He wanted a place to chill  enjoy a beer  and eat some comfort food. Since BJ\'s was kinda sorta on our way home  we decided to check it out again. I\'m glad we did. Hubby\'s steak salad was all that he wanted and my turkey burger and wedge fries hit the spot. Service was nice and friendly. I was amused to note that the staff who brought our food to our table assumed the ""chick"" ordered the salad. HA HA. NO. I may be fun-sized  but I can put away a LOT of food  especially after a long day hike. :)We enjoyed our calorie-induced coma whilst watching the Super Bowl on the many TV\'s in the restaurant. It wasn\'t too crowded at all; I think most people were watching the game at home. Great way to end a great hike."
Marina S.,Las Vegas  NV,37,36,22,11/6/2015,5.0,Was in for an early dinner today. Been awhile since we have been here. Very impressed with quality of food AND service we received. Got the loaded potato skins and Margherita pizza was very good. Whole family really enjoyed their meals. Best part was our server Jared B. extremely attentive  friendly and went above and beyond for us. In a service town like Vegas it's so nice when you get A1 service!
Lisa H.,Las Vegas  NV,213,199,77,11/10/2014,2.0,Ate there last year for my son's birthday and had great food and service. This time we had the worst waiter imaginable who didn't even bring us silverware. Food and drinks were bad  service was bad  I was pissed that I paid $100 for this drool. Serious indigestion for ALL of us  including our 4 year old!Waiter wouldn't bother to take the time to look up my BJ's card  never refilled tea  forgot to order my son's food which left him sitting there watching us eat for 45 minutes! Ordered my daughter's food wrong as well. Overcharged us for meals and drinks. Barely spoke English and obviously couldn't write it either. With so many more options now since Downtown Summerlin has opened one would think they would at least attempt to make an effort. I'm very disappointed and it was reflected in the tip or lack thereof. Having been a waitress in the past  there are a few things I expect such as silverware. I don't know why this place is packed or how it stays open. Perhaps everyone is parking there to eat at Olive Garden next door.
Chuck L.,Hawthorne  CA,0,1,,10/2/2016,3.0,The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because our waiter was rude and arrogant. The food and drinks was 5 stars . Keith is rude and makes u feel uncomfortable. I asked for prices on some beer and he said oh I don't know I just press buttons its different through out the region. I wanted to get up and punch him in the face . At the end he was trying to be nice even though he was pretty rude almost the entire Time .
Elizabeth H.,Las Vegas  NV,181,245,50,2/6/2014,2.0,Our waiter: I wish I knew his name. I could barely hear him when he spoke. He was whispering/mumbling and we had to ask him multiple times to repeat himself. We all ordered burgers  which a couple of us sent back. I have never seen a hamburger patty like these. First off  they weren't even circular  so they were falling out of the buns and all over the place. They weren't thick at all  but smashed down and falling apart and so thin in some places. They sent us new burgers after we told them  and the second round came out exactly the same. They hadn't even listened!We left a little disgruntled. Don't get the burger.
Carol K.,Las Vegas  NV,240,852,3627,4/3/2012,4.0,"Our first experience here didn\'t go very well  the waitress spilled an entire tray of drinks on my husband  they offered him a free T-shirt! We haven\'t been back since. So when my husband decided to give it another try  I was a little hesitant. We got a couple of appetizers  a flatbread pizza  which had fresh mozzarella cheese and sweet tomato sauce. Garnished with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. We also got the crispy fried artichokes. It was lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Both of these were very good.For an entree  I got a good old bacon burger  smoked applewood bacon  cheddar cheese  lettuce  tomato and pickles  smothered with their special sauce. It was juicy and very good. I love bacon  so if I would change anything  I would add more bacon!Service this time was very good  I enjoyed the food  my husband was disappointed with his choice of entree  the old fashion pot roast. He said it was truly ""old"" as in taste  he felt it was the left overs from the night before. But the menu had some nice looking items  especially deserts that we might have to return for."
Hailey C.,Placentia  CA,10,41,32,10/18/2015,5.0,Sunday fun day Vegas.  Go Miami go. Sunday's are looking brighter if they can pull out a string of wins. Bjs. Thank you for the good food and big screens.  And Patricia. If your listening. Thank you for the great service.
Michelle N.,West Allis  Milwaukee  WI,9,34,44,4/10/2015,5.0,We tried this spot because of a friend recommended it! We were very happy with the service and the food! This was out first visit- if we lived closer we'd definitely stop again!!!!The pizza was great and my husband loved his burger- all portions were very big which was nice.
Alexander M.,Las Vegas  NV,389,1005,2227,9/25/2014,4.0,"Always good times at BJ\'s! Brought a friend here that was visiting from out of town because for the people who live in Vegas we don\'t always want to deal with ""the strip"" just to get some good food! Although we missed the lunch specials that end at 3PM we were still pleased with this dining experience! When we walked in there was maybe about 10 people in there! Not busy at all! Happy hour was still in session and because they offer some really good $5 Mojitos I had to participate hehe! If you choose to do happy hour you must sit in the bar area and some of my personal favorites off the happy hour menu are the avocado rolls and the buffalo wings! We were a bit hungry so we still ordered off the regular menu as well! Calamari was a Very good! The Cherry Glazed salmon was a HIT! I recommend trying that if you are in the mood for fish and or watching calories because it\'s only 550 calories! Friend ordered the Brewhouse double burger with bacon and loved it! BJ\'s is known for their pazookie\'s and I personally like the red velvet one! Will be back soon!"
Ori B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,9,4,12/13/2014,3.0,good service  OK food  feels like another america food place...nothing special. Asked for a M burger and got well done. hate it when it happens.
Pam W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,9/8/2016,5.0,We went for lunch today and sat in the bar area. Dan was our server . He was so funny  friendly  helpful and happy to be our server which is so nice to see now a days. I had the caprese piadina which was really good and my husband had the lunch chicken breast with mash potatoes which he loved. So nice to be at a place where people don't hate their jobs and if they do ... no one is showing it. Lol Great people and Food! Oh I forgot to mention the Salted Caramel Pizookie! So good!
Michelle A.,Las Vegas  NV,121,24,11,3/7/2016,5.0,Love this location and the service here. I try to avoid peak times (weekend lunch/dinner). The food is fantastic and I love their craft brews and soda! I've been here 20+ times and they never let me down.
Jacob L.,Centennial  Las Vegas  NV,1,24,3,9/17/2014,5.0,Love this place! Menu is huge and can make everyone in your group happy. Gluten free menu is awesome! Sports always on the TVs. Great wine  beer  and craft beer selection.
Lydia N.,Las Vegas  NV,214,209,535,4/9/2013,4.0,BJ's is a great place to have some good food and a great dessert which is a pizookie. If you have been in the Eastern location  then there isn't much of a difference in the Summerlin location. Ratings: Food: (4)Service (4)Location (5)Ambience/Atmosphere (3) Overall (4)I ordered the Mahi-mahi tacos which consisted of two tacos  nachos and a dip. I really really liked it a lot. However  it needed a little more of the sauce to put in. Brad T. ordered his favorite pizza the buffalo chicken. Lastly  we ordered a white & chocolate pizooke. As always it tasted amazing and chocolate-ly.
Nicole G.,Las Vegas  NV,743,446,402,12/26/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,"Came here again after the line was too long at the buffet at red rock.Ordered the AYCE soup and salad for 6.95. what a fantasic deal. There was choice of broccoli and cheese  clam chowder  tortilla soup and chicken noodle. Brocoli and cheese is the cheesiest soup i""ve ever had  hands down. no joke. order it and youll see what i mean. The tortilla soup they do in this weird way but it works. They bring the chicken  and stuff in the soup bowl but with no sauce. they then at your table pour the sauce onto the dish which leaves the torilla chips in it super crunchy. its delicious. also  its a nice touch that they add avocado and a lime inside for a bit of a kick. The caesar salad is okay  nothing special. Its yummy but i ordered only one. Of the soups i ordered then both again. For our daughter we order chicken tenders and fries. The chicken was actually a great portion. three large golden crispy tenders that came with two dipping sauces. ranch and honey mustard. the honey mustard was delious but the waitress said its bottled. FYI she says the only sauce they make fresh themselves is the vinegarette. The fries were pretty good. They are super thin but it just meant they got cold uber fast. no bueno. My daughter really liked them.The service was impeccable. Our waitress was named Brittney and she was one of the best waitesses Ive ever had. She made light conversation saying she had a one year old as well. She even asked if while we waited would Leilah like some oranges. She brought a little dish with them in it to keep her occupied while we waited. Awesome. Moms FTW!"
Mike C.,Long Beach  CA,4,7,3,7/13/2016,1.0,Take out is very disorganized. Placed order 20 min before I arrived and I still waited an additional 20 min for my order. As I waited there was no comfort from the employees saying that my order is on the way or was still cooking. There were multiple people that came and got there orders way before I did.
Linda L.,Las Vegas  NV,97,34,520,10/22/2014,4.0,Service is good here. I always come for their appetizers!! My favorites are: avocado egg rolls  Spinach artichoke dip  mozzarella salad  stuffed mushrooms  Mac & cheese  and fried calamari. They have an excellent selection of beers! My favorite is the Jeremiah red! Their pumpkin ale is a must try during the fall season!
Suzi M.,Henderson  NV,24,10,,9/4/2015,1.0,My husband had a stroke which damaged his voice but otherwise you wouldn't know it by looking at him. Went to BJS on eastern tonight for daughters birthday...waitress Nicole served us all one beer and appetizers ...after what was to be our second and last /only had had one /she arrived at the table and rudely and loudly announced we could have another but husband couldn't. Never asked if he possibly had drank too much! He was humiliated. Manager was just as rude as he said she wasn't rude(he never heard it) this was the most unprofessional manager in a restaurant  ever -way over his head and horrible people skills. Needless to say our night was ruined no one offered any apologies. The waitress and manager shiwed total disrespect and we will never return. Horrible horrible customer service .
Stephen B.,Las Vegas  NV,2,11,2,7/21/2016,1.0,Terrible service  terrible food  terrible background music..(loud and blaring)and most of all terrible attitude from the manager...other than that  it was perfect
Denise K.,Las Vegas  NV,1,5,,10/4/2014,1.0,My husband and I went to BJ's yesterday to enjoy their lunch specials. I gave the hostess my BJ's rewards number as we checked in. My card was lost by a waiter on a previous visit.We were seated in a booth for two. A few minutes later  Nora  our waitress greeted us. She took our drink order and then our food order. I ordered the half sandwich and salad combination with the salad dressing on the side. My husband ordered the same thing except for no tomatoes on his salad.A few minutes later drinks and salads were brought out. My salad had salad dressing on it and my husbands salad had tomatoes on it. Strike one and two. No big deal  we will eat them rather than risk the rest of our food being spit in.Thirty minutes went by. No half sandwiches had been delivered. My husband was ready to get up and leave when Nora goes around  sees that we have not been served our food and runs away before we can get her attention. She comes back a few minutes later with our food.My fries were cold and the sandwich was soggy on one side and crusty on the other side. It was obvious that our food had sat under the heat lamps for a long time. My husbands food was the exact same way.Nora  our waitress  was no where to be found  so we asked another server to get the manager. Nora finally came over and went to get her manager.William M  one of the managers  came over to apologize for our food being cold and unsatisfactory. He offered us to remake our food at no cost. We did not have time to waste another 30 minutes for our food to be remade. He said he was going to talk to his staff about the quality of food that is served. Nora knew full well that the food she was serving us wasn't the BJ's quality standards that the manager was talking about.We go back to BJ's because we really like the food. This wasn't the first time our food was served cold or our order was lost or my rewards card was lost. For those reasons  we Will NOT be going back to BJ's. We have given this enough chances to this restraurant. We will take our business else where.
R K.,Las Vegas  NV,63,177,4,8/2/2015,4.0,Usually a pretty good meal at BJ's if you can handle the wait. Service is friendly but it's often difficult to get your server's attention. We started with Caesar Salads and asked the person who brought it to our table for fresh black pepper. She said she would let our server know. We waited about 7-8 minutes until we finally saw our server and asked her. Pizzas are always tasty. But the real reason my kids like going here is for the pazookies!!
David M.,Las Vegas  NV,1,121,201,3/7/2015,5.0,"Great first class service when you sign up for a BJs card at the check in desk. I checked in tonight with the hostess and gave her my phone number associated with my BJ card  and we were escorted right away to our table. There were around 20 other people still waiting in the lobby area for a table. The servers and manager gave us exceptional service  and catered to our special requests. The pan pizza we ordered tonight from their new pizza menu was wonderful. This is a great place to go with family and friends for any occasion. The location is easy to access off the 215 freeway and the Charleston exit.""One customer  well taken care of  could be more valuable than $10 000 worth of advertising."" -- Jim Rohn"
Neil M.,Indian Springs  NV,1,12,,2/24/2016,5.0,Service is prompt and precise! We've been to this location twice and have been over satisfied if that is possible. Price is very reasonable and the food was excellent. We will definitely return again. Highly recommended for lunch!
Alexy R.,Las Vegas  NV,354,144,113,11/23/2014,3.0,Stopped in for a quick lunch today with my family  I had the soup and salad combo (no refills on weekends)  wedge salad was watery and small  I'd rather order from Outback. The clam chowder was actually really good and filling  can't complain for $7.95. Next time I'll stick to avocado egg rolls and the pasta which are always good.
Brian S.,Las Vegas  NV,30,96,,1/3/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"The truth is I have experienced way better for the same prices they have there. Just on 01/02/2015 me and my wife did a order to go  for us and some of our family and kids. The order wasn\'t big  it was a pretty easy straight forward order.   I spoke to a girl name Brahel if I even spelled it correctly  she was very polite on the phone and took our order  so after ordering she read back what I said to her and then she gave a price and had no problem with it.    We went to go pick our food up and when we came home  the food we ordered wasn\'t there  only a portion of what we ordered was there  so I looked over my receipt and they charged me for exactly what I ordered  so I called them up stating I was missing items the girl Donna who answered the phone was very rude and said "" don\'t complain to me I didn\'t take your order "". She immediately sent me back to the ordering Department  so I was speaking with a manager.    The manager was polite and understanding  he said he would have someone deliver the missing items to our home. I called within 2 minutes of being home and noticing what was missing  we had to wait over an hour just to get the same wrong food....    The company doesn\'t obviously train people and specially have people listen. I called back and I had to explain again to the same manager that the items that I told him I paid for were still not there and he apologized again and said he would have them delivered  I said forget ir I just won\'t return."
P M.,Fresno  CA,0,45,11,8/21/2015,2.0,I wish they would've kept the pizza the same. Been coming to BJs since I was a teenager. I always order the same thing. I can taste the difference. I hate when people ruin a good thing. Glad the strawberry lemonade and Pazookis never changed
Alison P.,Las Vegas  NV,17,31,40,8/14/2014,2.0,Pros: We were seated quickly. Practically no wait time. we ordered the 4 beer sampler. I liked the house beers. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the oasis amber and the house blonde. When we asked for lemon for our water the waitress brought a lot of lemon.Cons: We were starving when we arrived and waited 30min just to order drinks. The waitress rushed off before we had a chance to order food. Another 30min went by before she brought our beers and we were so frustrated from waiting an hour we just asked for our check. It took the waitress another 10min to bring us our check 20 to pick up the check and 20 to bring it back to us. after about an 1 hour and 45min of waiting I was so disappointed in the service. I might come back and give it another chance. Hopefully it will be better next time.
Maryanne L.,Las Vegas  NV,124,50,68,7/13/2015,4.0,Bj's is always consistent . The food is good and so are the prices.  I have had a few visits with slow or sub par service but again it's pretty rare. The menu has about 4 pages of drinks and beers and lots of appetizers. The lunch menu is by far the best.
Jonny E.,Honolulu  HI,8,51,89,10/9/2014,5.0,Generous portions of food that taste great  they accommodated for our party of 9 in no time and the service was exceptionally fast and friendly  would recommend this place to friends and family with small or large parties...the ahi poke and rib eye was excellent!
Colleen T.,Las Vegas  NV,206,199,5,6/29/2014,3.0,This is your typical BJ's  with the giant menu and the cookie pie things. I've been here a few times  and the service is better than in Centennial  you get in and out quickly. I've never had an issue with a waiter or waitress. They are located by the Red Rock casino so you can always go to a movie and cross the street to eat here  or just get dessert like I do some times.
Jamie L.,Las Vegas  NV,34,74,27,6/27/2013,5.0,Call ahead seating!! LOVE  LOVE BJ's! It's one of few places that we can go to as a family and everyone is happy and content. It's less than a mile from my house which is super awesome and I've never been disappointed!! Yes  I know this is a chain and I am personally more a fan of the local eateries  but BJ rocks!!They have a kid's menu that the girls know like the back of their hands and I like that it includes celery & carrots and ranch or applesauce or a small salad. Not just fries (since those don't go over well with my kids).  The happy face potatoes are awesome too  but they are not fans. They now have a great ENLIGHTENED menu if you want to keep the calories down -- my personal ENLIGHTED fave is the chicken ala fresca  but the Garden Market Salad w/Blackened Chicken is a close second! We love their pizza - if in the mood for a thick pizza filled with goodness. Hubby loves their fried shrimp  chicken fried steak and many of their sandwiches. Breakfast is good too - not what brings me back every time  but it's noteworthy. Come on your birthday and get a free b-day sized pizookie!! Yum! They don't sing either which is a bonus  but their pizookies are amaaaaazing!!! I've never seen one disappear so quickly as they do when placed in front of my kids!!
Brett W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,14,1,7/16/2016,3.0,Im gonna give it 3 stars  more like 3.5 but i round down bc its not quite 4 star. There r a lot of crappy things on the menu to navigate around but they do open at 10am on the weekends. Their burgers r good. I am not a fan of deep dish but my wife loves the spicy pig. I like their sandwiches and the chowder is really good. Stick w those and the desserts and youre set
Elie M.,Las Vegas  NV,778,121,74,9/18/2015,5.0,Had the small pizza and salad. Pizza was very good. Mozzarella tomato with Balsamic dressing salad was awesome. But the best part was the service. Wait staff could not have been friendlier and I could not ask for better service. This was my first time but definitely not my last.
Amanda H.,Henderson  NV,147,5,3,9/23/2015,5.0,We love this location. The service we receive from Cinnamon O. is spectacular (being in the industry it takes alot to be amazed by a server). She was friendly right from the get go. She asked us questions and was genuinely interested in our answers. She was accommodating when our party size kept growing. She managed to keep the drinks and the conversation flowing on a football Sunday. This will be our new after work location on Sundays thanks to Cinammon O.
Johnny P.,Broomfield  CO,2,13,12,12/29/2015,5.0,Very good service and food   manager was awesome:) it's a must go to place !!!! They took the chicken parmigiana off the menu  but they made it for me anyway:)
Mel C.,Las Vegas  NV,230,1449,8033,10/12/2012,4.0,Located right across from Red Rock Casino and Resort. Everytime I've eaten here  it's never by plan. It's always been because either Yard House (at Red Rock) is too busy or I happen to be on that side of Charleston. As for the food. Probably tried almost everything on the menu at some point. My favorites include their Spinach Dip  Salmon  Lasagna  Pazookie  and their Great White Pizza. If you haven't tried their Pazookie  then you must try at least once. I prefer the Peanut Butter Cookie Pazookie over the Chocolate Chip. My favorite dish is the Great White Pizza. Chicago deep dish style pizza that taste like a pasta alfredo. I love it when they burn the crust a little. Sometimes I request it. Service is just average  but really good during lunch. I have to say  service is better than Yard House across the street. Any BJ's is a safe bet when your with a group and everyone is undecided where to eat. One things for sure  getting a table is a lot easier here than in the one's I frequent in California.
Alicia S.,Las Vegas  NV,51,2,2,7/16/2016,2.0,I'm usually a fan of bjs but this was my first time at this location and I probably won't be back to this one. First my daughter ordered the chicken Alfredo she asked for NO broccoli when she got it there was broccoli on it. Second I ordered a cherry Pepsi I got that but asked for a little more grenadine on the side it took 20 min to get it cause he forgot about it. Then I wasn't sure what I wanted so the waiter recommend this one burger so I asked if it had there special sauce on it and he said no then I asked if there was cheese on it and he said yes then I asked what else was on it and he said just bbq sauce so I got that he didn't tell me anything else that was on there  well when I got my food it had no cheese it had the special sauce on it and he failed to tell me there was green peppers and chopped tomatoes and onions on it. We told them about my daughters and when the bill came I was still charged for her food. My husband got the triple decker and asked the waiter for No mayonnaise and when he got his there once again mayonnaise on it. I understand there are going to be mess ups and I'm ok with that but on everyone's food that I had with me is a little much if you don't remember what people ask for you sure need to write it down. And one more thing every time if we need anything he never stopped at the table it was just a walk by is everything ok or do u want dessert . Not a good waiter.
Allen M.,Las Vegas  NV,1744,309,1478,6/12/2013,3.0,Can't say anything bad about the place. The food is okay. I brought my daughter with some of her friends there after the movies. They ordered chicken strips  French dip  burgers  and a big cookie desert.They seemed to enjoy the meal. It was a good place to bring the kids.
Anita D.,Las Vegas  NV,3,31,66,6/17/2014,5.0,Stopped for lunch  I love the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad & my husband tried the new Spinach with Seasonal Berries salad + Blackened Salmon...we ended with a Chocolate Chip Pizookie with substituted Chocolate ice cream!Downloaded their APP & saved $5 off the check :)
Michael W.,Las Vegas  NV,58,1,,12/15/2015,5.0,I have been coming here for years with my girlfriend because of the top notch service we receive. Jillian  our bartender there  always greets us and takes our order promptly and knows regulars by name.
Phillip S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,25,4,12/14/2015,2.0,Was once a great place to enjoy a great Happy Hour. They had good priced appetizers and a good selection. They changed all that. Prices are higher and portions have shrunk. With over 50 Happy Hours to choose from we won't be going back to BJ's.
Mishalonte G.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,2,2/13/2015,5.0,Great service and food what more could I say. Our waitress Danielle was awesome she kept a smile on her face and made sure we was satisfied.
Norm K.,Las Vegas  NV,1020,2239,10546,8/15/2012,3.0,I went to BJ's yesterday for lunch with a group of 11 people. There were four parties  including ours  with 10 or more people yesterday and the staff handled it well. The kitchen was a bit overwhelmed so our orders took longer than normal  but it was fine because we weren't in a hurry.I ordered the soup and 1/2 sandwich. For soup I ordered the tortilla soup. The sandwich was the turkey Cobb. The soup was outstanding. The tortilla strips are in the bowl and the warm soup was poured overtop so they retained their crispness. There was also some pieces of avocado and the flavor of cilantro was very present for a wonderful flavor. I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich. It was billed as roasted turkey. Well  it was  but it was luncheon meat roasted turkey and sliced thin for the sandwich. It also says with blue cheese dressing. It was there but the blue cheese flavor was not.As for our server  she was really good. My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass when I got low. She did commit a cardinal sin with one of my friends. He ordered another beer and when she brought it  she picked up his unfinished first glass and removed it before he could stab her with his fork. That's a big no no!! She didn't do that with the little iced tea that was left in my glass when she brought the fresh glass. Wow  were we surprised.Summing up BJ's  it's OK. It's not a place to which I'd go often. There are just too many good places to go in this town and this area.
Victoria K.,Las Vegas  NV,73,83,226,9/5/2014,4.0,This place is our go to spot if we are looking for something close to home. Service is a hit and miss  but food is good. I enjoy the barbeque chicken pizza  jalapeno burger  can't go wrong with a pizookie for dessert. Looking to get a buzz  they do have a great selection of drinks. Haven't had a dish that I've tried and wasn't pleased.
Brooke K.,Las Vegas  NV,185,29,28,9/14/2015,5.0,Jared B. was seriously the best server that I have ever had! He was fun and attentive! The Brussel sprouts were amazing! Our drinks were never empty even our mimosas and I had such a fun time! Great location! Great food! Great server!! Thank you Jared!
Donald P.,Las Vegas  NV,18,75,,10/5/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,BJ's is always a great place to go eat  and drink if you choose.. Always great service.Nice menu  popular prices. Lots of TV's. Love their burgers . Soup and Salad a greart deal. Salads great  Just enjoy BJ's.  A solid value. What more can one ask for 
Mercedes C.,Las Vegas  NV,9,11,6,9/27/2015,5.0,Very nice place. Friendly staff and food so good. Will definitely come back here. Planning allready to celebrate my birthday here soon. Will recommend to my friends and family to check this out
Danica D.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,94,21,11,9/19/2015,5.0,The New Orleans Jambalaya was on point! I had to send mad compliments to the chef. Let's not forget how scrumptious the Pizookies are! Yum yum!
Pamela C.,Honolulu  HI,14,13,,12/9/2015,5.0,Always good. Get their app  it allows you to get on their wait list  order take out  and decent discounts.
Allison L.,Las Vegas  NV,9,8,1,3/5/2015,5.0,Shawnda is one of the best servers ever. She's attentive & friendly. A must have are the avocado eggrolls.
Nikki Rose T.,Las Vegas  NV,278,233,661,4/27/2010,3.0,"The environment can be chill or loud  depending on when you go. They have TVs everywhere  which are great for watching football on Sundays. They do take big groups  but told us they could only separate the checks 4 ways max. Also  parking is a pain during busy evenings/weekends  especially since it is right next to Olive Garden.I do not like their pastas. The pizza is delicious. The strawberry lemonade is fantastic  but they can never seem to make a good batch consistently. The pizookie (white chocolate & macadamia is my fave) is unforgettable.I go here often  usually with friends  but it is far from my favorite. Their food is good  but none that I would ever be yearning for.After you get all the blowjob jokes out of the way  don\'t forget to order a pizookie. It\'s the one ""for sure"" dish they have."
Lloyd M.,NV  NV,50,63,198,3/22/2014,4.0,Berry blast cider is the best. I come to this restaurant just for the cider. It is a little on the sweet side but it takes a little sweetness to bring out the fruity flavor of the berries. This is a nice sports bar with plenty of room for group get togethers. The food is good and the menu is large enough everyone can find something they like. I will go back for the Berry Blast Cider.
Steve L.,Henderson  NV,2,45,18,9/2/2014,5.0,Just had a wonderful dinner here. Kris was our server  and she was absolutely wonderful! When visiting this location  be sure to ask for Kris and you will definitely get great service. Be sure to sign up for emails to receive special offers.
Craig T.,Las Vegas  NV,24,14,7,5/12/2015,5.0,Always a pleasure. Great wait staff. Friendly and professional. Love the drinks. The beers are greats. Loyal customers. Great food also......
Jack W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,18,1,11/26/2015,3.0,I am a fan of BJ's but the quality of food can only go so far. It seems that every time I dine there the service is passable at best. There have been times that the waiters(waitresses) take over 10 minutes to check on us. I can understand to an extent if it is very busy as it usually is  but I raise my hand for all those minutes and even if my server is not around there are multiple others that can clearly see me looking for some help that do not come.
Sheldon L.,Riverside  CA,92,121,18,3/13/2015,3.0,Food was good/okay . Service was okay. It was a Friday night  so may have had a bigger crowd than normal. Will probably return.
Lindsey L.,Las Vegas  NV,38,80,27,2/16/2014,4.0,So this is my new favorite chain restaurant since Yard House has been going downhill with the service and consistency. With that said  it isn't perfect. We have certainly gotten our share of inattentive servers (sorry to be sexist but the men tend to be the ones that leave us hanging for way too long  the women have been way more on top of their game here) and the hostess/seating people are fairly unfriendly. I always hate that the first experience walking in seems to be being ignored. Oh and the wait times can be insane  for that whole area of restaurants there  especially on a Friday/Saturday night......anyway  let's move on to the good shall we?The pizza - I think it is delicious  and this isn't even my favorite type of pizza  it is more of a deep dish  which I am usually not a fan of  but theirs is almost always pretty delicious. They had this mushroom  balsamic one that was SO FREAKING GOOD and I almost cried when I was told they took it off the menu  but alas  the Sweet Pig is pretty yummy too  so that is what we often get. The other stuff - I have gotten some other dishes but honestly  I prefer the pizza over everything else. Can't really remember what I have ordered  which probably says something  but the last dozen times or so have been all about the pizza.Now on to the PIZOOKIES - Soooooooo yummy. Little pans of cookies served up warm with ice cream on top. We have even gone just for dessert a time or two  they are really that good.We also joined their rewards club and have earned enough points for free pizookies and $10 off our meals  so that is always a nice incentive to come back. They also run decent meal promos sometimes (something like soup or salad  pizza and pizookie for 2 for $20) so a super cheap lunch is always a good incentive too. The atmosphere is pretty typical for this type of restaurant  generally busy and somewhat loud  lots of TV's going  etc.  but I find it to be a perfectly nice place to have a lunch or dinner out.
Cinthia H.,Las Vegas  NV,2,7,2,9/30/2015,5.0,Had an amazing experience  Our waitress Taylor was so sweet and attentive. We will definitely be returning for the delicious food and exceptional service. (:
Matt S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,12,1,4/27/2016,1.0,I used to like this place. I live nearby and was a regular. Today I walk in on Wednesday afternoon. The place is empty. They seat me at a small table so I ask for a larger one. The woman frowns  then sticks me in the worst corner table in the place. I walked out rather than debate the situation. You have lost a patron. There are too many good places that offer hospitality as well as good food in this area.
David J.,Las Vegas  NV,17,39,2,11/29/2015,1.0,Not a fan at all... I've been here multiple times because I wanted to like it but I just can't  food is horrible especially the pizza and never once has my order been correct... I'm finished with this place.
Ryan S.,Las Vegas  NV,1,7,,10/30/2015,5.0,Great atmosphere for catching the game or for a meetup. The pizookie is amazing just like everyone says. Nachos are bomb with some Jeremiah Red. Menu has a ton of options.
Ren M.,Southwest  Las Vegas  NV,75,39,20,6/1/2014,3.0,Only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is because of the service. Our waitress took so long to even come to us after being seated that when she greeted us we all knew what we wanted to drink and order. After that it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks. We felt like when we flagged her down we would need to ask for everything because there was a chance we wouldn't see her again for another 20 minutes or so. Usually get better service than this. Food was good as always. Fettuccini Alfredo is yummy. I love the small bites. Got crispy artichokes and the bruschetta. If you don't eat a lot id recommend ordering some small bites and maybe sharing an entree with someone. That's a good amount. As always order the pizookie for dessert! You can't pass on it. Good place to come with a group. Try their beers or do the beer sampler. Overall the food is good here. Service varies.
Andrew H.,Las Vegas  NV,94,64,245,11/9/2012,5.0,Good place to have an unplanned  spontaneous dinner at. My wife  son and I had the opportunity to do just that and we all had a fun time. Our server Destiny  was great! She had great recommendations  especially with their seasonal Pumpkin Ale  which was absolutely delicious! For apps we enjoyed crispy wontons  with tai dipping sauce & fried artichoke fritters. Wontons definitely won that battle.For entrees  my wife enjoyed a classic Bacon Burger  and I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken  which was great. Its rather large  so just remember that when ordering. For dessert we wanted a trio of Pazookies  and received 2 of which we ordered  and 1 which was not. They corrected the situation immediately which was nice.The one suggestion I will make is  I would love a brief description on the food after its delivered to the table by the food runners. Always nice to be reminded of what was ordered. We had a great  laughter filled evening and will definitely come back. Thanks Destiny!
Rosanne B.,Las Vegas  NV,1,13,,1/23/2015,5.0,Exceptional menu. They have everything from soup to nuts. Be prepared to be amazed at the number of choices on the menu. It's a fun environment. Their homemade soda is fantastic. A perfect gathering place for a family meal.
Jes S.,Austin  TX,1,16,,7/11/2015,3.0,It's like any other BJ's  it's fine  just not spectacular. Lunchtimes were always slammed and food took forever.
Miriam T.,Las Vegas  NV,388,133,361,12/15/2011,5.0,"I\'ve always been a fan of BJ\'s for many years.....ha ha! starting from So Cal and now in Vegas. Does not matter which state or city... the atmosphere  the customer service  and even the food are all amazing. I like this location since its across the street from Red Rock Casino and in the Summerlin neighborhood. Huge menu of appetizers  salads  pizzas  pastas  burgers  steaks  specialty entrees  etc.. I can go on and on. The menu is seriously like a book! I am the type that if there is a lot to choose from  I tend to get overwhelmed and indecisive! Hmm what does Miriam feel in the mood for today. I have tried many different entrees during the years and majority of the appetizers  and there is not an item that I did not like. All very tasty. I was craving MEAT recently  and I ordered their new ""Black & Bleu burger"" and my friend got the ""Crispy Jalapeno burger."" The angus patty was SO JUICY! It hit the spot. A MUST order is BJ\'s Famous PIZOOKIE. Pure DELICIOUSNESS. Lots of flavors to choose from like red velvet  white chocolate macadamia nut  chocolate  and cookies n\' cream. Well worth the calories! I. H E A R T. P. I. Z. O. O. K. I. E."
Kathleen C.,Henderson  NV,82,29,47,6/11/2015,2.0,First off the two stars are for the food otherwise i would give one star. Just had lunch here with my best friend and I definitely regret it. It was lunch hour and I understand it gets busy. Out server was Jose R and he seemed very nice at first. He took our drink orders and gave us time to look at the menus. When my friend ordered  he implied there's no lunch special for pasta on the menu. If there isn't then why is it on the menu saying there is? He must of been offended by our question because he only came by once after that. It took 25 minutes to get our food and we were limited on time so it made the experience worst. for TWENTY minutes we had yet to see a waiter pass by. Not one came and refilled our drinks. We had to get the attention of another waiter to tell our waiter to pay attention to us. Our lunch was ruined by bad customer service. Definitely not coming back to this BJ brewhouse again.
Jared W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,,9/15/2014,5.0,This restaurant will always be a favorite of mine. Before my father passed away  we used to come in at least once per week and would be greeted by three or more staff members before we were even seated. Seldom did we have inadequate service and the food always tasted great. After he retired  the highlight of his day would be to go to lunch and chat it up with his favorite waiters and hosts while enjoying some soup and salad. Your staff was so friendly and courteous to him  and I thank you for that.  I recently went back with my brother to catch up and  despite many new staff members  it was still an incredibly friendly environment with great service and delicious food. This BJs has a customer for life.
Janel I.,Las Vegas  NV,21,24,5,2/24/2014,4.0,I love BJ's restaurants but I have to shout this one out. The staff is always so accomodating and attentive!! A bunch of friends  about 10 of us  were celebrating a birthday and came in one saturday afternoon dressed up as zombies and they didn't bat an eye! We were taken care of and not rushed at all. Another Monday afternoon I had lunch with a friend and our server James was so great! No rushing through the lunch crowd  he treated us like we were his only customers. This BJ's is a great place for dinner before or after a movie at Red Rock; or anytime! BTW they have great drinks and specials :-)
Sheila B.,Las Vegas  NV,2,28,,1/19/2015,3.0,I've picked up dinner three times; Twice the food was very good  once very bad. Check your order before you leave; two of our salads were a watery mess with virtually no toppings  just lettuce. I'm sure they would have re-done them  but didn't want to drive back. The sandwiches and burgers have been very good  Jambalaya and salads  bad. The pick up system is very convenient. Just park in front at the designated spots  call the number posted  and the server comes to your car.
Ann B.,TRINITY CTR  CA,38,52,,4/19/2015,4.0,I ordered the roast beef dip  very good. However  no one came back to refill water or soda  or to check if we needed anything else. Still love the place  great atmosphere  wonderful food.
Daniel L.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,,8/21/2015,4.0,Very good  flatbread is very good. Google has calorie information online  and soon on the menu. The location is usually very loud  unless being in the backnroom. Make sure to order a pizooki.
M D.,Las Vegas  NV,17,164,560,11/29/2014,5.0,Biggest Buffalo Chicken Wings Ever....they are huge! Great Ranch : )
Edith Z.,Las Vegas  NV,37,70,69,3/29/2015,5.0,Food here is great. The service is always exceptional! I've dined here twice with my family and each time was impressed with the service. I will definitely be back. Thank you and keep up the great work
Krysten D.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,4/3/2016,5.0,Service is always excellent and food is always on point. And that salted caramel pizookoe ooooohhh :)
Jade W.,Las Vegas  NV,678,1184,1231,7/26/2011,4.0,The BF and I shared:Butterfly Shrimp basket. Came with about 12 big shrimp  coleslaw and fries. These were good  panko breaded and not greasy. Small great white deep dish- More doughy almost like having pillowy bread with toppings than how Chicago style is. Good though. Pizookie Trio- we got red velvet  chocolate macadamia  peanut butter. One plus is they don't skimp on the vanilla ice cream. I've never had these before as I don't really ever have space for dessert. The service was great. Our server seemed to know how to pace themselves well in checking up on people and walking by to see if you need more drinks. The BF didn't know they make homemade sodas  but it was no issue for the server to switch to homemade rootbeer from ice tea. They brought us the check after putting our dessert order in so by the time we got dessert  we were all checked out. More servers need to do this! It's awesome not needing to wait for the check.  It's a decent chain specially if you like beers and homemade sodas.
Amir A.,Las Vegas  NV,1,63,9,4/23/2014,1.0,"Ate here a few times and everything was excellent. Decided to dine here tonight and ordered the same thing I always do  Avocado Egg-rolls and Moroccan Spiced Salmon. Egg-rolls arrived and they tasted weird. Couldn\'t figure out what was wrong with them. When the entree arrived  it looked as if it had been dropped on the floor and then re-plated. I pointed out to the server that it looked like a disaster and her response was ""Yes  they do throw allot of stuff in there"". I took a few bites and it just tasted horrible. Sent it back and within a hour I was sick beyond belief. Not sure if it was the egg-rolls or the salmon but I\'ll never eat here again. They should have better controls to check the food quality before serving it. It only takes one time to lose a customer  especially when you get food poisioning. However  the server was very friendly. After I sent the food back she came and told me that it didn\'t look right (wondering why they didn\'t see this when they served it to me).If I ever decide I need a full body cleanse I\'ll make sure to dine here again."
Dave N.,Las Vegas  NV,849,434,210,6/30/2013,4.0,"I don\'t know what took me so long to write a review on BJ\'s. I\'ve been to many of their locations in the past  but it was never really anything memorable. Perhaps I wasn\'t paying attention.Recently  a friend and I came to this location for dinner. I like the beer selection (both in-house and other craft brews). The food was awesome! I had a steak that was cooked to my liking. The best part is my friend got the Jambalaya. She raved about it before we arrived  but I didn\'t really pay much attention. I tried a bite and was floored at how savory  spicy and perfect this dish tasted.The menu is quite diverse. You\'ll find something for everyone. Service is good.This is a great ""go to"" spot if you are in the area.Don\'t miss the jambalaya."
Demariyea M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,8,1,7/21/2015,2.0,Ordered the chicken fettuccine it wasn't worth the money. Along with there being a small spider on our table   place wasn't as good as people made it seem.
Niki M.,Las Vegas  NV,41,162,131,5/25/2012,4.0,Busy place in the evenings. Server was good.Food was good. I will go back to try something different.
Necktar F.,Woodbridge  VA,0,23,,3/21/2016,4.0,Pretty good casual dining. I will repeat.
Greg B.,Chicago  IL,0,33,9,4/25/2014,4.0,Bar tables are good to see TV and mingle. Love the happy hour pricesEvery time we come  we try something different on the menu and are usually pleased with the taste and temperature. Staff and manager seem to care about making sure things are right. So if you don't like something  they are usually willing to help make it a better experience for you.
Jennifer W.,Pomona  CA,29,18,1,3/28/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Went in last night with a party of 18. Donna and Courtney are amazing. Thank you for being so accommodating. Was a great experience.
Randy B.,Westlake Village  CA,4988,2310,4419,10/5/2011,4.0,Consistently good; great BIG menu & draft beers; what can be bad?This location is in Summerlin  across from the Red Rock Hotel. When you don't want to mess with the downtown/strip area...this is a good choice for an alternate place to grab some grub with the locals. As with all the BJ's  the pizza  brews  salads  and tons of other items  desserts (can you say pizzookie?)...it's all good stuff. Plus  lunch & happy hour  and late hour specials. My favorite thing on the menu (for years now  and I never tire): the BBQ Chicken Chop...which I feel is the best I've ever had (sorry CPK). Salads don't travel well  but everything else is served in HUGE capacity and get read for a 'take home' box.The service is very good at this location. The only downsides is that it gets awfully busy  and parking is difficult to get in the front of the restaurants (shared with other restaurants)  so you often have to park on the backside and walk a bit around a large building.
Marlena G.,Las Vegas  NV,104,22,7,5/14/2015,4.0,Had take out   and although the avocado rolls are very good I think they had a recipe change because they use to be very sweet and now they are kind spicy. They have very good salads and pizza !
Brad T.,Chicago  IL,621,416,180,12/31/2013,4.0,I am a huge fan of this Chicago style pizza joint. The pizza is deep dish and solid and their beer on tap is all brewed in house or locally. Service is generally solid and price reasonable for what you get. Personally I am a huge fan of the Buffalo Chicken Pizza which is just the right blend of spicy and pizza if there is such a thing. Also their Jerimiah Red ale is pretty solid also.
Rachel B.,Austin  TX,601,465,950,4/22/2013,3.0,I I really enjoy BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. I had actually never been to one until I met my hubby a few years back and boy was I missing out! I'm glad he showed me the light!The menu for BJ's is quite extensive and has something for everyone in your group. Their pizzas are fabulous and come in so many different varieties or you can design your own. My fave would be the White Pizza. Anything with Alfredo sauce and I am in love. My husband disagrees and always goes for the Classic Combo pizza. It is good too  but not as pretty as the White Pizza. Looks aren't everything  I know  but it is true in this case!They also have a ton of other things from burgers  sandwiches  steaks  brunch (on the weekends)  lunch specials Monday-Friday  and even low cal choices. I don't anything about those because I am a full fat kinda girl  which is probably why I'm not a size 2. They even have french fry options! Now that is just awesome because sometimes you want skinny fries and sometimes you want wedge ones. GENIUS!And of course  they have a ton of beer! They make about a dozen different beers and even switch it up throughout the year in the different seasons. For you non-boozers  they also make their own root beer  cream soda  orange cream soda  and black cherry cream soda. I always go for the cream soda and I am always happy.The service is usually ok  but it does waver  which is why I gave this location 3 stars. Food alone is easily 4 stars  but the service knocks it down. Sometimes you go in and your server is on it  but sometimes  like this past weekend  it was a diaster. Our food took 40 minutes to come out. Some of it was hot  some lukewarm  and one had been under a heat lamp for way too long. We were all so hungry (Warning  do not mess with my family when we are hungry because you WILL get hurt!)  we didn't send it back because we were afraid it would take another 40 minutes and we had plans afterwards. We were not the only ones with this problem either  as I heard the tables around us all complaining about the same things we were talking about. The manager on duty wasn't particular helpful either and we didn't even see him until we were already 35 minutes into the wait. We asked him about the food situation and he tried to make a joke and then blew us off. I would say 80% of the time you will have a great experience  so definitely try it out. And get some cream soda too!
Joeli C.,American Fork  UT,0,7,2,3/5/2016,1.0,We have gone to this restaurant many times and every time we wonder why. They are so slow and if you have more than four people  be prepared to wait for at least an hour. With all the options nearby  don't go here. Last time for us.
James S.,Los Angeles  CA,705,1194,443,8/17/2011,3.0,A better Chili's. This is the type of restaurant that keeps people from fitting into their clothes. I generally don't go to places like BJ's because everything is so full of fat  lard  fried you-name-it and portions are always large. I realize I am not their target demo here  but still was happy to come here for lunch to splurge a bit.The server gets a Star for the various things I threw at him: Changing which Fries I wanted after already placing the order; Side of jalapenos; and the biggie---- having my California Burger delivered deconstructed so that I could pick and choose what I wanted. He went one step further and put the cheese on the bread  and had the bread completely separate from my burger. This was a great way to enjoy the burger. The burger itself seemed a smallish 1/2 LB and very thin. Consequently  not terribly juicy --- but not bad.The in-house Root Beer was good and refills came without request.The desserts looked good and others seemed to like them. I did taste the Grilled Salmon which seemed pretty healthy and tasted fine but nothing too exciting. Steak Fries are well-seasoned and a nice change of pace. I glanced at their 'Chicago-style Deep Dish Pizza'. Optimistic thinking  I'd say. Very friendly staff.
Clayton K.,Las Vegas  NV,93,112,2,7/1/2013,5.0,BJs is as close as you're going to get to pleasing everyone.Neat subtly communist decor in a very large restaurant. Came in on a Sunday afternoon and got right into the bar. Lots of TVs with sports  and bizarrely clustered taps. They have a spectacular selection of beer; including their own which is usually quite good. They have several different samplers  including one with enough sizable samples to tranquilize Nancy Grace during a double murder trial. And they really mean full bar. In fact  they mean full everything.The secret of BJs is it's menu; everything is really pretty good  and that's a feat because they have a huge diversity of entrees. If you have that friend in your group who has specialized diet concerns and can only eat blue foods from islands that don't feature indigenous amphibians BJs can feed them. BJs is great for large groups for exactly that reason: everyone gets what they want. No matter how stupid it is.Mega Bonus: The waiter split our check with no muss nor fuss. Always impressive in the land of the unified restaurant bill. It may not have a ton of personality  but if you need lots of either different types of food or a huge selection of beer it'd be hard to go wrong.
Love D.,Las Vegas  NV,172,17,7,5/12/2012,5.0,Friday nights are really packed. food is great!! a must get is the Pizzookie (sp?) my fave is the white chocolate macadamia nut. Another favorite of mine is the balsamic chicken entree off the 500 calorie menu. I can't remember exactly what it was called but it's bomb! The happy hour menu is ok. Beer is good! Service is excellent!
Jennifer H.,Las Vegas  NV,35,88,10,4/8/2015,5.0,This was our first time at this location. We ordered the balsamic chicken  chicken alfredo  sliders and gourmet Mac and cheese. All of the food was fantastic! We had a few requests  and they were given to us with no issues. I forget our server's name  but he was a very nice young man and did a great job. We will definitely be going back.
David S.,Manhattan  NY,22,123,,10/27/2013,3.0,The food is very good  but that's not the big takeaway. This is NOT a good place for kids  and by kids I mean anyone who needs a highchair. They do not have functioning highchairs at this restaurants. They have about a half dozen broken chairs  which of course serve no purpose. This has been for about a year now.The food though is quite good. Tuscan Chicken Limone is solid  and should be ordered if it appeals to you. Also  don't leave without dessert. The pizzas though are overrated. Enjoy  but leave the kiddos at home.
Dirk T.,Cheltenham  Canada,0,14,,5/11/2014,3.0,Service was good  food was... Ok. Ordered a medium rare steak which was medium only. The presentation was not so great. Also ordered Angel hair pasta tasted like mr noodles with a lot of oil. California burger was good but a bit on the oily side. Kale and Brussels spout salad with blackened salmon was good. Overall experience was ok  the waitress was friendly and forthcoming.
Andrea A.,Las Vegas  NV,2,5,,3/22/2015,4.0,I like going there  but I would love going there if they would bring back their original ribs. These ribs were so good  melting in tour mouth and not to sweet  not spicy  then they changed the recipe and now they are so spicy that I can't enjoy them anymore. Otherwise they have great food  super service.
Hannah S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,6,8,5/8/2014,5.0,I've always enjoyed my experience at BJs. I've been going there occasionally for four years and the service has never let me down. They're always friendly :)Plus  there's a large variety of pizza  beer  burgers  salads  pasta  and meat (steak  ribs) to try. And you can't leave without ordering a pizookie ;) trust me.
Debbie N.,Las Vegas  NV,675,352,1522,3/23/2011,4.0,To start out  the only BJ's that I have been to before this is across the street from MGM Grand. So to come to this compared to that  this place is impressive. I came for a baby shower for a friend and we had a section in the back side area  where there were other bigger parties. They had set-up a buffet table so when the food was ready we just went up and grabbed what we liked. I'm usually not a fan of potato skins but it was really good because they were crispy. The other food items  such as wings  pizza  and salad were nothing special. The best part of the restaurant is the service. The servers were so nice and I felt like it was my very own neighborhood restaurant. I would def come back to try their regular menu.
Nora F.,Las Vegas  NV,1,6,,3/14/2014,5.0,My first time here and it didn't disappoint! The food was delicious. My husband and I got burgers and wings  and the wings were fantastic! They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Make sure to order them tossed or they will only drizzle the sauce on top (wouldn't be enough sauce). The burgers were perfectly cooked and were huge! Had to take half home.Next time  we're going to try the pizza!
Joni W.,Las Vegas  NV,99,126,103,8/25/2013,4.0,Get 4 finicky female foodies together and you better find a place that has something for everyone. BJ's usually provides a good fix. Since we're usually starving by the time we meet up  appetizers are a big deal. Because there's a BBQ thing going on  we tried the corn fritters with a special aioli (light textured fritters  with just enough corn...not so much that it makes it too dense and chewy). The calamari was flash fried and tender  with a barely-there seasoned batter. At first  the chicken lettuce wraps didn't look like it would be enough to share  but we all had at least two wraps each  doused with the hot mustard for some bite. Good experience  so glad it's in our neighborhood. Tip: Send someone in to sign up for a table while you find parking; get a head start.
John F.,Las Vegas  NV,202,236,26,2/24/2013,4.0,Weren't planning on dropping into BJ's for a late lunch (or early dinner) but the other place we wanted to go had a long wait. There was a bit of a wait at BJ's for tables but we were able to grab a spot in the bar area with no wait. Server was friendly and food is as expected at BJ's... consistent and fair priced.Ordered two small plates  the mozzarella and tomato salad and the bruschetta bites. Both were really good and were a nice starter at just a few bucks each.Ordered the grilled burger melt with wedge fries and Kacey had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Both were good and my burger was cooked just how I asked.Of course one of the best reasons to go to BJ's is for the beer. I'm a big fan of the Blonde... one of best light beers I've had.All in all  good service  good food and good drinks... BJ's is a solid option any night.
Wayne G.,Las Vegas  NV,207,492,196,9/4/2011,3.0,Service is good  beers are good but $5 for a small draft beer is a total rip off! The thin crust pizzas are very good  ribs were just OK  Dave's BBQ ribs are far better. Good 80s music selection. Very cool and hip atmosphere.Wayne Gorsek
Carl S.,Las Vegas  NV,50,104,3,12/1/2014,3.0,The beers are very nice. Always good. The pizza is deep dish and the pans are nicely seasoned as to give the crust a buttery flavor. The service here is great. On the down side  it can get a bit noisy with the high ceilings and hard surfaces  but hey it is casual dining.
Ivan R.,Las Vegas  NV,0,8,,2/10/2016,4.0,We were there yesterday with a large party of 13 ppl. A lady Toni was our server. I could not believe how professional she was and outstanding service. We were such a headache with our party with like 5 separate checks and people trying to use coupons  but she seems to be on top of everything and extremely nice! Most servers would have lost it. It was my sons birthday and he had a great time. Only reason I'm not giving 5 is because we did have to wait 45 mins to be seated.
Alice C.,Palmdale  CA,1852,280,506,12/13/2014,4.0,I must say this is one of the nicest bj I have ever been in the service is better than all the others I have been in my waitress was at our table every five minutes to check on us. BJ'S IN SUMMERLIN AWESOME
Robyn L.,Las Vegas  NV,118,292,296,2/27/2011,4.0,Never disappoints. Excellent Chicago style pizza. Crispy on the edges...chewy and gummy in the middle. Yum. We also had Italian market salad. It was a little overdressed and a bit salty but hearty and flavorful. I personally love the berry burst cider on draught. Crisp and refreshing. I don't know when this happened but they now offer a pizookie trio. This was perfect when the three of us couldn't decide on flavor! We got three individual smaller versions for $9! Yippee! 4 beers  a salad  a pizza and the pizookie trio cost us $78 with tip. Always busy in there so expect a wait. The trick is to seat yourself in the bar.
Kelsey P.,San Diego  CA,98,197,37,12/6/2014,5.0,Jared was awesome! This was my first time to this location and it was really nice. Most other ones I have been too seem very crowded and not a lot of space but this location is spacious in the bar and restaurant area. The food was great as always  the service was awesome and the atmosphere was good. My aunt goes a lot and she was surprised how empty it seemed to be but even with a few larger parties and people sitting near us  it was not overly noisy!
Evy M.,Las Vegas  NV,39,12,2,2/23/2015,5.0,This place has the best salad by far. I am so not a salad person :) but the Santa fe salad is to die for. I love coming here with the family or on a date night. It is very hard to find places where the kiddos can eat and enjoy being themselves ....you know just kids and this place is on my top for both. Oh and the service is outstanding. On a date night my husband and I had some drinks and where chatting along when we didn't realize that the food was taking a little longer than usual (mind you the place was pact) well the manager came over and apologized for the inconvenience and gave us a huge discount! !!! Way to feel welcome :)
Kristy B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,1,1,9/21/2014,1.0,Don't ever make the mistake of going to this place to watch your football game on Sunday!!! I have never experienced such rude people - the bartender and the manager. I could go on and on  just save yourself the aggravation. This place clearly doesn't know anything about football and it's fans.
J D.,Anaheim Hills  CA,4961,1982,28926,10/11/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,This is rapidly becoming one of my favorite places to have lunch on Sundays. They have Happy Hour all day long during the NFL Football games.This visit we ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders ($5.75 happy hour price) and BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza ($5.00 happy hour price). To wash it down  I had an IPA.The food came out quickly. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders and dove right into it. They were awesome! The combination of Pulled Pork  Onion Ring Strings  and tangy BBQ Sauce went well together. The Onion Ring strings had a nice sweet taste and the BBQ Sauce was tangy and balanced the palate.....the Pulled Pork was very juicy and full of flavor. Sooo good. I ordered Wedge Cut Fries with the Sliders and they were cooked just right....not under/over cooked.My Mom couldn't finish her Pizza  so she gave me the last couple of bites.....it was very good as well. The thick crust was soft & buttery with the edges slightly crispy....hmmmm!Overall  another awesome experience @ BJ's!Will I return? Hell ya!
Kami A.,Las Vegas  NV,56,21,9,11/7/2014,4.0,We haven't been in a while. I had the fish and chips. Mostly for the fish and not the French fries. The fish was so crunchy and the tarter sauce has some spice to it now which is a yummy surprise. I would definitely recommend the fish for sure!
M. L.,Las Vegas  NV,1,13,3,5/15/2015,1.0,"I am a Vegas native and was a long time customer of this restaurant. I would like to share with you my terrible  and last experience  I will have with this establishment. I met two important people for dinner and we were ""served"" by Cinnamon O. We are familiar with outstanding service.. being connected with several five star establishments and companies. At the end of our meal we decided to mention the profoundly dismissive attitude and lack of regard for our experience with Bjs Brewery. The manager apologized and we appreciated the responsive communication  however  I will not be returning to this restaurant. Please take into consideration that body language  such as rolling your eyes at customers and having a blatant lack of manners is not what this company expects of its employees. Head over to Yard house or the BJs in centennial area where we have never been mistreated for a better dining experience."
Dickie D.,Las Vegas  NV,1,28,,1/23/2015,5.0,My favorite place in Vegas! I get the pizza every time and am never disappointed. Gluten free items too which aren't always easy to find. Beer is awesome too. Can't wait to go back....maybe tonight!
C G.,Seattle  WA,14,154,60,11/12/2014,5.0,Fabulous food. Parmesan crusted chicken and twisted blt spinach salad were amazing! Service is top notch. We are from Washington so sadly can't eat here often. Open concept with great music. Great strawberry majors too and beers.
Jay A.,Las Vegas  NV,267,431,581,4/27/2013,4.0,So if you can past the semi obscene name of this place  you are in for a great selection of food and beer. They also have a loyalty program worth joining. To be clear this is not fine dinning but it is often better than the other chains in this space. So if you want to get out of the casinos and go to a casual dinning restaurant and pretend like you live in a normal town  this is a good choice. Live it up  you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
Taeler H.,Las Vegas  NV,1,56,4,12/18/2014,5.0,Great service even when they are very busy. We were seated immediately in the bar area and our server (can't recall his name  started with an M) was great! We redeemed our coupon for a free pizookie too. Great experience!
Jessica M.,Henderson  NV,18,35,11,11/14/2014,5.0,BJs is always amazing! Tonight we had a server named Jared S. Excellent service :) he was engaging and prompt!!! We waited for about an hour to be seated; it was well worth it to get excellent service!
Jennifer M.,Las Vegas  NV,714,98,59,5/25/2014,3.0,The only thing on their menu that is outstanding are the Avocado Eggrolls. These are a must. All of their food is okay  I guess I'd say good  but it's a bit boring. Something I can't describe. Eat here 10 times (including takeout) and you're burnt out. Takeout is usually ready on time  but there's usually a wait on the weekend which is scary bc this place is scary big. So imagine how long it usually takes to get your food. I much more prefer this place for lunch. They have lunch specials and there isn't usually a wait. Service can be spotty  depends on who you get and wether they're hungover. If you are unfortunate enough to go on the weekend try to grab a seat in the bar if you don't want to wait close to an hour for mediocre food. But make sure you flag a server down or you won't get service for a while (we've waited a half an hour for a server in the bar before).
Kristina O.,Cypress  CA,98,348,44,11/19/2010,5.0,I've been to BJ's probably over 10 times  and I've always been consistently impressed by their food. I've had so many pizzas  pastas  tacos  and desserts from their that I've lost count  but I will showcase some of their highlights. I usually don't get appetizers from BJ's because their food is in really large portions  so I'm full by those alone  but I've gotten their chicken tenders before  and they're really good. They're nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside like you'd expect. They also give you this tangy honey mustard dipping sauce with them which is a great complement. They also come with a mountain of french fries. The fries don't taste too good with the honey mustard  so I usually just ask for ranch dressing for them... because I think ranch is the perfect dipping sauce for fries  not gross ketchup.Their pizza is great. If there is a long wait  and you have to sit in the waiting area  the servers will come out with deep dish pizzas put up into individual bite sized pizzas for the crowd to sample while waiting. I think this is epicly nice of them because I would be perfectly willing to wait  but it's always nice to snack on a little slice of pizza too. hehe. I usually just stick with pepperoni pizza. It's a classic and is loaded with lots of meaty pepperoni  stringy cheese  and hearty tomato sauce. Normally  I hate tomato sauce on pizza  seriously  the less sauce the better  but with BJ's pizza  their sauce is so flavorful that the abundance of it is fine with me! Their barbecue chicken pizza is really solid as well. I've had it a couple of times. I like CPK's BBQ chicken pizza better  but this is a nice deep dish take on it. Next time I go  I need to try the buffalo chicken pizza to see how that compares to various ones that I've had. Maybe I can persuade my boyfriend to go there this weekend. hmm...The sandwiches are really yummy. Their pulled pork is really tender and not dry at all. The Cobb sandwich is tasty too with the addition of bacon  cause everything tastes better with a littler... err... a lot of bacon on it. The BJ's burger is great  but you should definitely add bacon to this one for the reason that I mentioned above. Their parmesan crusted chicken is delicious. It's very cheesy  and their mashed potatoes are very creamy. Their fish tacos are great too. They go great with a side of strawberry lemonade to drink.So... as if this review wasn't long enough... DESSERT! First off  get a pizookie. I've seen some of my friends' pictures on facebook where they've gone to BJ's and they've ordered something like the apple crisp for dessert. I've shaken my head at those pictures many times. Seriously  you don't know what you're missing unless you get the pizookie! It's the best part of the meal. I always get Triple Chocolate Pizookie with Ghirardelli chocolate. My boyfriend and I split it  and it's pure decadence even after you claim that you're so full that you can't eat dessert. So yeah... this was a really long review  but I've been here so many times  and I really wanted to share how much I love BJ's. I will definitely be back soon.
Jason C.,Centennial  Las Vegas  NV,10,64,28,11/22/2014,1.0,ate there tonight! Was happy all food was great! 2 problems dinner took 1 hour and 40 minutes from when I was seated! 2 I ordered a house salad with ranch I ate the whole thing it was yummy....... My wings came next I ate those too very good! As I sat for what seemed forever for the 3 small pazookies we ordered for our extremely well behaved considering it took so long children I went to move dishes out of way because no one bothered to clear my table the ranch cup was stuck to table! I lifted it to reveal what I thought was wax! I thought to myself wow good idea to stop from sliding........ Upon further inspection by removing I began to realize a firmiliar smell it was ........ Mint! Wtf? Why was there gum under my ranch cup? Gross asked for a manager he gave us 3 free kids pazookies! Big deal? Was this to make me feel better? It was gross! Never going back ever and calling SNHD Monday morning
Teri C.,Las Vegas  NV,1625,1012,2245,4/30/2010,4.0,"Happy hour at BJ\'s Restaurant Brewhouse is worth a look!Offered on Mondays through Fridays from 3 pm to 7 pm  and reverse happy hour on Sundays through Thursdays from 10 pm to closing.$1 off all Draft Beer and CocktailsHalf off all Mini Pizzas$2 off all appetizers (BJ\'s Snacks & Small Bites not included)You can only take advantage of their happy hour in the bar area - so cozy up to the booth or the high tables!For our party of three  we shared three flatbreads and we enjoyed them all!* Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage ""Mozzarella  Fontina and Parmesan cheeses  fresh basil with a hint of oregano  sliced Roma tomatoes and a touch of Italian sausage."" ($8.95)* California Club ""Grilled chicken  crisp Applewood smoked bacon  tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado."" ($8.95)* Grilled Chicken Pesto ""Basil pesto sauce drizzled over mozzarella and fresh Parmesan cheeses then topped with grilled chicken  red onions and sun-dried tomatoes."" ($8.95)I can\'t remember which one was my favorite  but I know we were impressed by all of them and happily finished them.I also enjoyed their Double Berry (10 oz) ""Berry Burst Cider & Lindeman\'s Framboise"" ($5.95)  which is part of the HH. It definitely gets packed though during these hours  so get in there early. We barely got up from our booth when another party was happy to take it over. It\'s a busy restaurant with means the noise level is high and parking can be challenging."
Sheila G.,Las Vegas  NV,486,684,1198,10/2/2010,3.0,I've only been to a BJ's once - in San Diego - but had never tried the one in Las Vegas until last night. It was Thursday night  and this place was jammed - pretty good  considering the economy  so I figured I was in for some super food. I wasn't blown away by the meal  and the service was sub-par.I had a turkey burger. I didn't want fries  so I was able to substitute steamed broccoli. The burger was okay - not bad  but as bland as could be. It came with Swiss and slices of avocado  lettuce and tomato.  Nothing to complain about  but nothing to rave about  either. The broccoli  though  was inedible. It was partially cooked  but not that crisp  delicious stuff that Chinese restaurants do so well. This was RUBBER. I had the waitress bring me mashed potatoes instead. They were good  but too salty (What else is new?). My friend had the turkey burger  too  and felt the same way about hers - Average.Our husbands both had Parmesan-crusted chicken  and they were satisfied. Again  nothing to rave about.I just don't get it. There are so many places in town that have above-average food. They offer hefty discounts. And they're empty. In my humble opinion  BJs  which rarely has coupons  has a menu that's not much different from any other similar chain restaurant  and has food and service that doesn't distinguish itself in any way  has a steady stream of customers. And judging by the Thursday night crowd  probably has lines out the door on the weekends. I think it's kind of sad.
Barikzai Z.,Las Vegas  NV,5,23,2,5/30/2012,4.0,I didnt know this place existed around here. I absolutely love their fried artichokes appetizer which is totally worth $4. I would also recommend their clam chowder (around $8) MAKE SURE TO ORDER IN A BREAD BOWL. They toast the bread and make it very tasty. I am not a big fan of their pizza  but overall good food. Very busy especially in the evenings. Make sure to call and ask how long the wait. ***BE SURE TO END THE MEAL WITH A PIZOOKIE :)
Stephanie K.,Spring Valley  Las Vegas  NV,39,2,,12/22/2013,5.0,We took my mother in law here for brunch before a movie at Red Rock. I'm still rather new to Vegas but I'm learning my way around. This was my first time in BJs. This place was packed and I know why. The food was phenomenal and the price cannot be beat especially for Vegas. 3 meals plus an appetizer and our bill was under 35$. I thought the server had messed it up but when I checked everything was there. By far the best onion straws in the valley. Yes I am becoming an onion straw expert. The plates are well sized and the food was so good. We will definitely be back.
Deysi O.,Las Vegas  NV,5,17,6,5/16/2014,1.0,Food sucked no flavor at all. Everyone hated their food .. service was not their from the minute we walked in .
Christina W.,Centennial  Las Vegas  NV,87,24,7,3/8/2014,5.0,The food was delicious and the service fantastic! I've been to the Centennial Hills location and it is very good  yet it pales in comparison to the experience I've had today at this location. I'm so pleased that I would consider going out of my way to go here.
John M.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,,5/15/2015,1.0,Horrible customer service in regards to seating disabled people! They disregard the disability and seat you where they want not to the needs of the customer. No attempt to accommodate! One star due to I had to rate otherwise it would be a zero! Contacted manager who was more interested in reservations then a now former disabled patron!
Mullet S.,Auburn Hills  MI,0,9,4,9/18/2015,5.0,Fucking delicious. I went for lunch and had the soup and salad  some amazing choices. Great beer selection but priced so you only want to have a couple.
Lions D.,Las Vegas  NV,1,43,6,10/10/2014,5.0,First time here and decided to stop for lunch. Got the soup and salad lunch special. Great choices of soup and salad. And didn't have to wait like at Olive Garden for soup and salad. Very good and will be back.
Alison V.,Minooka  IL,740,572,522,12/12/2010,4.0,Much better than expected. We got the brush-off from the first server  I guess she didn't want to deal with a handicapped  old  quirky family member that was dining with us.Our second server was perky and funny. They ran out of both the homemade root beer and homemade cream soda and it was a running joke for the rest of the meal. BTW  the homemade orange cream soda was great.I had a salad that was huge and flavorful  and the other two diners had fish and chips  which again were an enormous portion. We split a mini deep dish pizza which we said on numerous occasions that it was supposed to be served as an appetizers. We even ordered it 15 minutes before our entrees. Low and behold  it came out at the same time as the entrees.As for the drinks  the Frosty Peach was amazing. I would go again just to get hammered on the drinks.
Savannah R.,Pahrump  NV,109,322,55,3/27/2012,5.0,One word: Pazooki. If you dont try this dessert you are missing out!Prices are great  quality and taste of food is excellent  happy hour prices are decent  and the staff is outstanding.
Susan L.,Las Vegas  NV,371,669,1922,7/31/2010,4.0,Bj's is one of my favorite places to go for happy hour 3pm-7pm (I think). Their Garlic Kettle Parmesan chips on the small bites menu is one of the regular items I like to order. It's a good size portion that can easily feed three people. It comes with caramelized onion dip and a buffalo sour cream. I prefer the caramelized onion dip because it doesn't take away from the flavor of the chips. Their mini deep dish pizzas are delicious and cheap during happy hour. Their appetizer portions are enough to make you so full that sometimes you don't have room for their Pizookie! I also found out that they can make the Pizookie into a half ..half order. It's helpful when you share this with someone who is the complete opposite of you because they can customize it to your liking. I find eating here during happy hour is sometimes cheaper than eating fast food and it's more filling.
Matthew M.,Las Vegas  NV,39,2,8,7/30/2014,5.0,Go to place for dinner. Since I don't cook! Lol. Great service and amazing food and drinks.
Kacy T.,Henderson  NV,88,20,,6/17/2012,3.0,"Went to this restaurant for dinner with the hubby - loved the food but the service could have been better. I ordered the sampler of beer which was fun. I always love getting the sampler at Yardhouse and was happy to see they had one here as well. As an appetizer I started with the Ahi poke bowl - it was perfectly dressed and the tuna was super fresh. I always order this dish anywhere it is on the menu and I can say this was the best I have ever had. I had the mini caprese salad next also fantastic - they used a very creamy mozzarella and it was the perfect portion for a midcourse. For my entree I had the buffalo chicken pizza -super thick crust and a nice drizzle of ranch on top. Not only did it look like a work of art but it tasted fantastic too. Now my husband was not as happy with the meal as I was.Ffirst the waitress convinced him not to order the beer battered shrimp that he wanted and talked him into a pulled pork sandwich which he didn\'t really enjoy. The biggest issue however was the timing of the food delivery. Or salads were brought out before the appetizers were even half way finished and the entrees came out not even 3 minutes later. We were sitting there with 6 plates of food on the table. W e enjoy going out once a week for a ""date night"" and like to take our time and enjoy our meal. We definitely felt like we were being rushed.Overall the great food way outweighed the lack of basic service and I would go back again. Next time I\'ll request to space out the courses."
Bryan D.,Las Vegas  NV,155,236,58,9/7/2012,4.0,A nice place to go to get a steak or salad later in the evening. Unfortunately  they close at 11pm.I have had nothing but good service here and I prefer this place over the Yard House simply because it is not loud and overbearing at night. On the many visits here  I've had the Turkey Burger (it was moist and delicious)  the Rib-Eye at medium rare (perfect!)  the Thai Chicken Mango Salad  (the sweet dressing really makes it POP with bright flavor  and the Santa Fe Salad (the fire roasted red peppers  jack / cheddar cheese  avocado and corn make this Santa Fe Salad one of my top Southwestern Salad favorites out of any restaurant...)For desert  we sometimes get the PIZZOOKIE! Chocolaty goodness is yours to behold! Definitely try it if you have room for it at the end. It's very worth it.The servers are usually quick and on top their game. The restaurant is very clean and neat. The ambiance is very casual and perfect for a date.I'll be coming back here for sure.
Brandi H.,Rifle  CO,0,8,1,4/20/2014,4.0,It's was a nice atmosphere and the food was good. Great service. Will go there again. Nice place to gather with a few friends. They also brew their own beer which is pretty nice :-)
Jen K.,West Linn  OR,507,1914,6250,12/14/2009,3.0,Our trip to Vegas ended with neither a bang nor a whimper and that was fine by me. After spending time at Red Rocks Canyon  we wanted a simple dinner before heading to the airport to catch our flight. We initially went to The Vintner Grill  but that was way too upscale for what we had in mind. We'd been hiking all day and I wasn't feeling (or looking) swanky. While I prefer non-chain options  this brewpub clearly has their act together.BJ's has a sports bar feel and an enormous projection TV above the bar as well as multiple flat screens throughout the large restaurant. Sunday night brought out people in droves  and I can understand why  since this place seems equally enjoyable for families  singles and groups. It was a great place to watch some football and the restaurant just hums with activity.The service was incredibly efficient and we saw the entire staff hustling. What is unfortunate is that the food isn't nearly as special as the atmosphere and service. Mr. K ordered a beer and I had to be different and chose hard cider  but neither was great. One of their specialties is deep dish pizza and again it was only OK. For the standard entrees  portion sizes are enormous and I was happy we shared dessert since the BJ's Brownie is served piled high with whipped cream.For the food alone  this is a three-star joint  but it really doesn't give this place enough credit. It would be a semi-regular hangout if they were located in my home town. Funnily enough  my local sports bar has a very similar name.
Adam W.,Las Vegas  NV,85,20,3,5/21/2014,5.0,Went here for Mothers Day dinner last week. It was the first time at a BJs location for myself and my daughter  although the rest of the family had been there in the past. We had a large deep dish pizza (BJs special) and a medium deep dish with anchovies. I can honestly say this was some of the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas! Very fresh ingredients and I liked how they use fresh cut tomato instead of tomato sauce in the pie. BJs offers an extensive menu and is an excellent choice for a family gathering. Very kid friendly and excellent food. I will definately be back and would recommend this restaurant to others....
Beryl C.,Long Beach  CA,227,157,89,5/11/2014,4.0,"BJ\'s Restaurant and Brewhouse boasts a delicious assortment of brews and cocktails. I\'m not a beer drinker but occasionally go here for lunch because they have a decent-sized menu  reasonably-priced lunch specials and plenty of tables with almost no wait time. I recommend trying their Southern fried chicken resting on a bed of cheddar mashed potatoes and corn. BJ\'s also offers ""enlightened"" items  food that\'s healthy and relatively low calorie. One of my lunchtime favorites is the Maui pork chop. Just one grilled bone-in chop with a sweet glaze  served with potatoes and crisp green beans. Finish off the meal with their famous Pizookie  a cookie baked fresh out of the oven and topped with ice cream. It\'s to die for."
Vegas J.,Henderson  NV,2369,86,7124,2/6/2012,4.0,Thursday night about 9pm it was busy. Parking was packed and is tight lot.The booth was not lit well but spacious.We ordered fried artichoke hearts as appetizer and it came with a mayo type dipping sauce. Only like $3.95 and a must try before meal.We got the new Asian Kung pap chicken. It was supposed to have alot of veggies and snow peas but only had a couple and good rice. But it tasted good with alot of chicken.The the Californificatiin flatbread  it was good but the mayo sauce drizzle was kinda nasty so I took it off. The tipping were good The finally was the desert giant pan baked fresh chocolate chip cookie topped with massive scoop of French vanilla ice cream. Sugar shock WOW and bust out the defibrillator. Sweet heaven has arrived. Try it you'll be back for more!
Jason W.,Henderson  NV,17,16,,7/21/2014,4.0,Love the Brewhouse Bacon Cheeseburger! The wedge fries are bomb too. Favorite appetizer is the Avocado Egg Rolls! BJ's is vastly becoming a very regular dining spot! Great service as well. They could offer a better Happy Hour. Other than that  I highly recommend this place!
Taylor F.,Las Vegas  NV,223,5,,5/2/2016,1.0,Let me first start off by simply stating: DO NOT GO HERE. I repeat.. DO. NOT. GO. HERE. The service is horrendous. If zero stars were an option  they would have earned it. I had the worst experience I think I've ever had at a restaurant tonight. They made my family and I feel totally uncomfortable. We actually ended up leaving before our food came. It was THAT bad. Both the waitress (Toni) and management staff (especially David) acted totally unprofessionally. Additionally  I've been here on several occasions and wait for way too long every time to get seated and receive food. The service is NEVER good  which isn't surprising considering how I'll-suited their manager is to MANAGE. As a business student  I am well aware of how a manager should treat patrons  and this is not it. My family and I have lived here for over 15 years and have frequented this place since I was in elementary school. I vow to NEVER go back. Seriously  take my word for it. Plus the food is subpar at very  very best. It really was just close to our house  that's the ONLY reason. And now I have no reason to ever come back. I have called the corporate office and am waiting for a response. They must know how horrible this experience was.
doreen p.,Las Vegas  NV,25,16,5,1/23/2012,5.0,Wow  had a great lunch special today Chicken Tortilla Soup and Caesar Salad.Unlimited Soup & Salad $6.95Your choice of soup and a house or Caesar salad (unlimited refills). For some reason I thought I had to order only one type of salad and soup. When the waiter came back and asked if I would like another soup/salad I didn't realize I could order a Clam Chowder  Chilli or Minestrone Soup. It was fantastic!They also have snacks and small bites starting at $2.95 so you can have a variety. Desserts? Pizookie's to die for!!!You're never too old to enjoy our freshly baked  hot out of the oven  rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Your choice of Chocolate Chunk  Red Velvet  White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut.orBJ's Baked BeignetTheir delicious bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown  tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream  fresh strawberries  a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream.
Charles H.,North Las Vegas  NV,2,27,9,3/27/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Recently discovered their curbside service. Just another reason to love this restraunt!
Paolo D.,Las Vegas  NV,805,975,79,8/9/2010,3.0,I should finally finish this review I started a while ago. In short  BJ's is a good chain restaurant with good brews. If you like IPAs  I recommend their Tempest IPA  which isn't on the menu. Secret IPA for the win!The last time I was there  it was for the World Cup 2010 Final. We chose this venue because our buddy had $70 in gift cards. It's really not the best spot to watch sports  but it served its purpose.On this visit  I ordered their Jambalaya. I wasn't completely sold on it. I don't mind spicy  but this one was to the point of barely tasting the dish. In the past  I've had their deep dish pizza. I remember it being pretty good.
James D.,Las Vegas  NV,117,12,2,6/17/2014,5.0,Always eat here with my boys. Love this place. Ate Saturday before Father's Day and had a great experience. I've only had one shortfall in service here once and the one time I did  I didn't have to bring up. BJs staff recognized on their own and apologized on their own! Great staff and management team here!!! Always come back!
J C.,Lahaina  HI,1,140,38,6/9/2014,4.0,Love this place. We live near here so we come here pretty regularly. We like to sit in the bar  we typically get better service if we sit in the bar area. Food is pretty good for the most part. I think I have only had 1 bad meal here. Chik parm was definitely not very good. Love the atmosphere. Sign up for BJs rewards and you can get free appetizers and other good stuff.
Mike B.,Las Vegas  NV,170,187,105,12/29/2013,4.0,I like the atmosphere in this place...who doesn't like a place to watch games and throw back some brewskis? Food is a cut above normal chain restaurants..not spectacular but good.Besides after 4 or 5 beers everything tastes good anyways. I will definitely frequent this establishment.
Emily H.,Las Vegas  NV,24,67,11,12/19/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,The service is the reason why I almost never dine in and grab curbside. I can avoid the tip that they don't deserve so that's what I usually do. Food is always better fresh so I decided to stop in today. There was a party by us - that had already finished eating by the way  but they also had a different server. My boyfriend and I took about 10-15 minutes deciding what to eat and we had at least 5 servers walk by (including the one who ended up being ours.) Our host came by and asked if we had been helped  and we said no. Our server finally came by and wanted to take just drink orders after 20 minutes? I said no  we're ready to order.. hello lady my menu is hanging off the side of the table. Anyways  I got my salad before my drinks! The manager dropped my salad off and didn't say a word. Not thirsty or anything! Then our food came but was run by someone else (signs this server SUCKED if she can't run any of her food)  and no ranch. Can't have fries without ranch  and our server didn't come by for at least 10 more minutes to check on us when she didn't even run our food. I like this place  but not this location. I work in the industry and I just wish I could do the job for these people  it's pathetic. I wish the Centennial location wasn't so far - seems like people actually care about service  timing  and their tips!
t t.,Las Vegas  NV,0,20,23,7/21/2014,4.0,Try them for the first time and it was pretty good  my kids love the chicken tender. Service was fast and friendly. Everything on menu are bar food.
Robert C.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,2,9/3/2014,3.0,Great food poor service my step mom fell and broke her finger here on my birthday and not one employee offered to help
Rick J.,Las Vegas  NV,0,2,,8/28/2014,5.0,I like this Resturaunt . It's always consistent in its meal perpetration and regardless of time of day I always get a seat. The service is great never had a bad server. Seems priced right and could easily be my favorite neighborhood Resturaunt
Marisol J.,Las Vegas  NV,3,2,,3/25/2012,4.0,"Bj""s is one of those restaurants I have a love hate relationship with. Some of the items  I just love some are not so great in my opinion. First things first parking can be a hassle at times  and your bound to wait re guard less of what night of the week you attend. I like the atmosphere and decor very much. The wait staff is pleasant enough  yet often make mistakes with our orders. In all fairness we usually have rather large family dinners there.Now  the food. They have great soups the tortilla soup is my daughters favorite with fresh avocados a top. My son and I love the Tomato Soup  truly creamy and delicious with large homemade croutons. I usually start to get full with just my soup. On most evenings we go my daughter orders their Chicken Alfredo  she normally loves it.....occasionally can be dry. I ordered a little more sauce was charges an additional 3.50 ouch! My son usually goes for their Jumbalaya which is very delicious and huge portion  or their ribs both are very tasty. I waiver between their New york strip  which by the way is great! or at times go for their other pasta dishes on the menu. I personally am not impressed with their pasta dishes  find them a bit tasteless. Also their pork medallions with white cheddar mashed potatoes are great.....I can\'t ever leave this restaurant with out eating desert. My kids and I are crazy about their warm fresh baked cookie with ice cream a top called Pazooky  I\'m sure I\'vemisspelled that....l.o.l. yet a sinful and necessary experience! Dinner there usually can be a bit pricey with appetizers and desert usually about $90 to $!00 for the three of us. Bj\'s is always a family favorite  with variety for all offering a huge menu and great to go service too.Bottom line is  if I ask my kids to pick a restaurant to go to  always seems to be Bj\'s a leading contender!Marisol Juracka  LV  Nv"
Alana B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,1,,8/18/2015,5.0,Came here for the GF pizza because I had a craving for it  and it was phenomenal! I had the chicken bacon ranch and the crust was excellent  not dry  and the pizza had great flavor. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice  she was attentive and very fun. Loved it here and will be coming back!
Emily F.,Las Vegas  NV,0,18,1,8/15/2014,5.0,Their parmesan crusted chicken is the best thing in this world!!! Soooooooo good! And then they have those DELICIOUS cookies with ice cream  they are to die for. Soooooooo good!!!
Kevin L.,Las Vegas  NV,15,26,18,10/6/2011,4.0,"I never thought I\'d see myself reviewing conglomerate type restaurant like BJ\'s. However my most recent experience inspired me to take a few minutes to spread the gospel on some great things that most people are probably missing out on.First off their fish & chips have the most uniquely delicious batters I have ever encountered. I don\'t know how they do it  but the batter is flavorful  crispy and surprisingly flaky. It absorbs the malt vinegar or lemon juice while still maintaining its crunchiness. Every other beer batter I\'ve tried  the vinegar or lemon juice just glides right off and makes the batter soggy. They\'ve learned how to break the laws of physics with this magical beer batter.Second notable item offered at BJ\'s is their Irish Root Beer  which is their micro-brew root beer mixed with Jameson  Butterscotch Schnapps  and Bailey\'s. The drink comes out frothy  messy  and overflowing like a great root beer float. If you\'ve never tried it before  you don\'t know what to expect when you taste it. The best way to describe this flavor of this drink is with words from that guy in that Daffy Duck cartoon. BJ\'s Irish Root Beer is... ""Amazing! Marvelous! Stupendous! Colossal! Tremendous! Gigantic! Astounding! Unbelievable! Spectacular! Phenomenal! And it\'s good  too."""
Angel N.,Las Vegas  NV,26,68,85,4/18/2014,5.0,The atmosphere is amazing. The food is great. The avocado rolls are delicious. The Santa Feel salad with the blackened salmon is the best. They have tropical tea unsweetened which is nice for a change. Great customer service and comfortable booths.
Yuna K.,Reno  NV,294,119,9,6/4/2012,4.0,I grew up with this restaurant. This was my neighborhood restaurant from middle school even until now  and man  am I lucky to have such a great neighborhood restaurant! I'm a frequent visitor  and I've never tasted anything I didn't like here! There's the pizookie  which is a given. Red Velvet is my fave! All of the salads are great. Just had the turkey burger which was bomb! The waiters are always accommodating and it's just a great casual place to hang out and visit whenever!
Monica W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,18,,4/2/2013,4.0,FOOD= GoodSTAFF= GreatPRICE= $$This is the best BJ's location in Vegas area & right across the street from Redrock Casino so something to do after lunch or dinner. Chili bowl  is very good and goes great with one of their house brewed beers.Oreo pazookie is a must have and you might not want to share its amazing!
Lynn S.,Las Vegas  NV,0,29,,7/29/2015,3.0,Pretty good. My bf loves the lunch menu here. The seating isn't my favorite it's much too open for my taste. Even after they changed it from the time they opened. The menu is ginormous! So I think most of the food is pre made and frozen! The last experience for me wasn't the best. The waiter told me that my flat bread that I ordered wouldn't have bacon on it (the description of the item on the menu did not mention bacon) however as soon as he puts the food down on the table it is almost completely covered in bacon! So I asked him what it was and he apologized and then just took the food bank. Maybe he was nervous for making a mistake but he didn't even ask if I'd like something else instead. So I sat there foodless and unhappy! The hostess walked by and I mentioned this to her and then the manager appeared at our table trying to correct the situation. I did appreciate his efforts. But I didn't eat anything. I was over eating.
Mike S.,Las Vegas  NV,13,67,4,11/20/2011,1.0,"What a joke. I can\'t believe I was actually prepared to pay $12.00 for an individual pizza and a small side salad.Ordered curbside. Lady said it would be 20 minutes. I arrived to find no parking whatsoever. I called and told them I had arrived but there was no parking in the designated ""curbside"" spots. Lady who answered had no solutions. So just then I noticed a spot  told her I had found one  and asked her to please bring me my order. Well  no one ever came out. I saw a waitress serving other cars  but she didn\'t bother coming up to mine. After waiting over 10 minutes  I simply left. Went around the corner and grabbed a couple of slices from Roco\'s for $5.00! They were delicious.Guess what? They never even called me to let me know my order was ready! You people have some nerve charging way too much money for average food and deplorable service. Stay away from this poor excuse for a dining facility..."
Sunny L.,Las Vegas  NV,3,60,,8/13/2014,5.0,BJ's prices are fair and we are always happy with their food. I recently tried the bison burger and was impressed!
Pam G.,Apex  NC,25,287,,3/26/2012,3.0,We stopped in to BJs for lunch after hiking in the Red Rock canyons. We sat in the bar area and were quickly greeted and had our drink order taken immediately. The service started to go downhill after that. We had a very long wait for our drinks  to the point that we had to flag down the server to see if he had forgotten about them. He was not polite with his response that he was 'waiting for the bartender to pour them'. We did finally get our drinks and placed our lunch order. The first thing to arrive was our friends chicken tortilla soup. They made a nice production of pouring the broth over the soup at the table  presumably so that the tortillas didn't get soggy  but he had no spoon. We couldn't flag anyone down for a spoon  so my DH finally went and asked someone for a spoon. We still sat there for a long time before a spoon arrived. When we finally saw our waiter again my Dh asked him to bring our friend a new soup (ok  he may have TOLD him to :-))I think at this point our waiter realized that our service hadn't been great and he brought over a sample of one of their beers which was nice. The funny thing though was that I also got chicken tortilla soup and when they brought it  after all of this  no spoon! Maybe they have a shortage  idk. We knew to ask immediately this time and they did bring it out pretty quickly. Having said all that  we all really enjoyed our food. The chicken tortilla soup was very good  the mac and cheese was excellent  the chopped salad was great and huge  and they recognized that our service was not good and did try to make up for it. They also made a very tasty margarita  so it's worth another visit.
Linda C.,Las Vegas  NV,1,16,2,8/11/2015,5.0,First I must say  we have been to BJ's restaurants previously  but tonight was the best experience ever and it was due to our server  Courtney. She made the night wonderful and full of fun! She was very attentive and engaging and because of her  we will be back. The food was very good  we had the fish and chips  bacon guacamole burger  chicken dinner and a half and half pizza.  For dessert  we had the mini triple combo pizookie and everything was excellent and the beer selection is awesome! Great place to sit and visit with family and friends. Great parking and convenient location right off the 215 and Charleston.
Hiza R.,Las Vegas  NV,137,10,2,12/5/2013,3.0,The food is the only reason I come back here. The service is awful!A dinner for two people should not take over an hour and a half. The restaurant wasn't overly busy either. It took awhile to get our orders and when the orders came out we asked for a side of ranch for our fries. By the time the side came out  we were about done. We ordered a pizzookie for dessert. When we were done we waited a good 15 minutes for our check. There is no reason why a check would take that long.
Kelly M.,Las Vegas  NV,85,102,59,8/14/2011,5.0,I just love this local brewery tucked away in one of my favorite areas of Summerlin. The food is always consistent and yummy  the service is impeccable(you are truly treated like a guest) and we never leave disappointed. Amazing Bonuses:Their deep dish buffalo chicken pizzaSmall Bite Menu (affordable and perfect portions-our favorite is the artichokes)The salads (I love the Cesar and market)Lunch SpecialsHalf off wine night on Tuesdays!I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants delicious food in a relaxed environment. Keep up the consistency  BJ's!
Matthew R.,Las Vegas  NV,16,33,1,2/28/2014,3.0,Usually four stars and the three are probably my fault for trying something new. Almost always get bison burger which is a delicious low cal option. Today I went low carb and got the wings. They came with the sauce on the side and I am a wet wing fan. The sauce was ok....may have been franks red hot. Bleu cheese was very thin and no celery came on the plate. Tracy the bartender always remembers my tea order and is very friendly.
Jennifer L.,Las Vegas  NV,179,131,526,6/23/2011,5.0,Been here countless times for birthdays and lunch. All their portion sizes are big enough to share since I never ever finish my entree. It's a great place to bring a group if you're treating cuz you'll be saving money. Large entrees that are shareable are probably the deep dish pizzas (yum) and their pastas. I also think their lunch special runs from 11am - 3pm. It is also really nice to just come here and sit at the bar with a beer and watch some games on their tvs. Service: I'm really surprised at all the negative comments about service. I went during lunch this past Friday and my server was more than beyond courteous and very attentive. He came back to check on us 2-3 times and also made sure to let us know that the food was on its way. I guess you just have to get lucky?
Alisa N.,Austin  TX,7,99,,8/1/2011,5.0,Yes  it's a chain-but it's a great chain! The food never fails to disappoint  and there's something for everyone on the menu. It's a very family friendly atmosphere  yet you wouldn't hesitate to take a date here. It's always busy  but service is on point :) The avocado eggrolls and pizookies are a must-do. One tip-do check your take-out before you go home. Once  they left out the very important sauce for the avocado eggrolls. Ugh! Try the red velvet Pizookie!
jonathan r.,Las Vegas  NV,0,43,,10/9/2014,2.0,Generally my wife and enjoy going for the good beer and tasty food. On our last trip when we go the bill I noticed that we had been billed for an extra beer. The waitress said she would take care of this. About ten minutes later she came by to say she was trying to get the manager to take it off the bill. Five minutes later we walked to the front and asked to see a manager. A lady who said she was a manager said she working on get the charge removed  but had to get approval from her manager who was busy with another matter. Get your act together  BJ.
Janel S.,North Las Vegas  NV,368,308,435,1/28/2012,4.0,Service here was fantastic. Destiny was such an amazing server. She was so bubbly  cheery  and very attentive. She sure knows her brewskies! She helped me find a good brew of choice  and she also made light conversations with us. Such a sweet waitress. Also  I left forgetting my keys on the table and the nice busser flagged me down and gave me my keys back. Thank you sir!The food is a-ok. I think for a lunch special that is $5.95  I really can't complain. I had the chicken quesadilla and my friend had the bottomless soup and salad. the good part about that is you can switch off your soups and salads if you want to try something different. I honestly come for the pazookie. They have the best pazookies  and they bake the cookie the way I lllloooovvveee my cookie! Soft and doughy. My ultimate favorite is the macadamia nut pazookie. I'm really tempted to try the red velvet  but my heart just can't let go of the macadamia nut. I guess I'm just not ready to let go yet...(It's complicated).I also had the Nutty Brewnette which had the very carmelly sweet and nutty. I also must warn you that this brew sure's got some HOP to it. After one drink I was getting quiet and I'm never quiet. If you are all about a strong roundhouse kick in your brew...try the Piranha...I was about to choose this one then Destiny kind of warned me that it's got a really strong spicy taste to it  and it's got a whole lot of hop to it. So  I backed out on that one. But if you are one who is all about the IPA intensity..go for the Piranha.
Tom D.,Las Vegas  NV,97,42,19,3/1/2014,4.0,Great food as usual. Either greasy bar food or healthy options this place has it all. My favorite is the Crispy Jalapeo Burger.
Theresa M.,Las Vegas  NV,104,60,17,9/25/2013,4.0,Good beers and service. I love the stuffed mushroom appetizer so dee-lish. They have a gluten sensitive menu you too. The California chicken sandwich is my so good!! Grilled chicken with avocado and green chilies with pepper jack on sour dough. I know it's a chain but this location has a locals feel. Good eats with TV's everywhere. So no one will miss the game.
Sharon M.,Las Vegas  NV,7,79,5,2/15/2015,4.0,Blackened salmon was tasty. You can never go wrong with the pizookie for dessert.  Our Server had a great personality which makes dining enjoyable. For a chain restaraunt its solid.
Cody P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,15,,5/10/2014,4.0,Excellent beer and a large menu make this place stand out. The black and blue burger is awesome and they will even cook it medium rare for you. Also try the pazookie if you want desert. The meditteranian pizza is great too.
Nick H.,Puyallup  WA,15,250,7,11/23/2011,4.0,A great place and surprisingly good lunch specials were on-hand at BJ's. We recovered from a long hike at Red Rock with some tomato bisque and toasted sandwiches  and both the price and selections were great.  We had pretty good service  too.I still don't quite know what a pizzookie is. Perhaps it's best left one of life's secrets.
Jeannie F.,Celina  TX,6,54,10,7/25/2011,4.0,Only reason I give them 4 instead of 5 is because they can be a bit slow. But I keep going back because I love their food!Great kids meals - and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken - so good. I've turned several people on to it.They have a new rewards program but seems to be a bit bumbly - the hostesses and servers seem to get disconnected handling it - but if you remind the server when they give you the check it usually gets resolved.
Jess P.,Las Vegas  NV,52,273,59,1/26/2013,5.0,I LOVE BJ'S! (hey  get your mind out of the gutter! :p) I like BJ's because they have great beers on tap (if it's still January  try the Grand Cru!!) The Grand Cru is a special brew they do at the beginning of the new year and they don't re-brew it until next January  so get it while you still can! As far as food is concerned  don't order anything else besides the Bj's favorite pizza. SO GOOD! It has like everything you could ever think to put on a pizza. Finish your meal off with a pizookie and life is GOOOOOOOD.
C Heisman R.,Las Vegas  NV,2,29,15,3/8/2014,5.0,Love this place. Great service I go out of my way to find this restaurant. Every dish I've tried has been tasty
Christine M.,Las Vegas  NV,16,58,6,11/20/2011,5.0,This is up there in one of my top 5 restaurants. I get excited every time we go here  like a little kid would get excited for Disneyland  lol. Their menu selection is never ending. A part of me wishes their menu was smaller  because I never know what to get! I feel like I am always missing out on something! But  no matter what I have ordered I have never been let down. Their Avocado egg rolls are so good I can barely stand it! I am not a beer drinker  but I order beer here cause it's so delicious. Their seasonal pumpkin beer is amazing. My boyfriend raves about the pazookie dessert  but we are always too full by the time we are done I just can't do it. I told him one of these days we will just come in for beers and dessert and skip the meal  ha! Give the place a go if you haven't yet. I doubt you would be disappointed  unless you are looking to woo your date with some romantic meal  then go somewhere else. No  it doesn't have ambiance as I saw one person complain about... but this is not that kind of restaurant. It's a busy loud restaurant with sports on the TV's  what do you expect? Go to a classy joint for a romantic night  this is a low to moderately priced brewery people! And a wonderful place to grab a bite of great food and a good beer!
Karen D.,Las Vegas  NV,5,76,,10/22/2011,3.0,"Crowded night  lots of kiddies (with lots of screeching).. not the best ambiance  to say the least.However  my pork chops were absolutely fantastic.. I was amazed at how perfectly prepared they were. The rest of the plate  meh.. but the pork chop I ate was incredible. The one that hubby ate was also incredible  but not the reason why... his ribs were terrible. The potato was enormous  ridiculously so.. and his ""smoked"" ribs weren\'t smoked  they were boiled then some sauce was slapped on and they were finished on a grill. It was obvious  and their menu was a lie.Will I return? Possibly... but not for the ribs. They get a bonus point for removing it from the tab  but they lost a point for him having to resort to eating half of my meal because no server came around to find out how the food was  thus giving him a chance to order something else."
Bryan B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,6,,5/22/2012,2.0,***** Service: Our server was great. I wish I could remember his name - he is a young Hispanic kid with a faux-hawk. Seriously  excellent server.**** Kids: The menu is great  with several options for kids. All kids items are $5.99  which includes a main dish  side dish  and a drink. The only problem I found is that if you have a child who needs a high-chair your wait will be longer because of the lack of tables - their booths are not designed to have a high-chair on the outside.* Food: It is just not very good. My wife got the jalapeno burger and was not impressed  which is saying a lot because she is not very picky when it comes to burgers. I got the Cajun pasta with shrimp and  while the flavor was okay  the pasta was terrible. At least half of the noodles were stuck together in groups of 2 3 4 and more! Obviously  this makes for some crunchy  impossible-to-eat pasta. How hard is it to cook fettuccine noodles? It was like someone stuck them in a too-small pot and just left them there for 6-8 minutes and then tossed them on a plate.Conclusion: Unless you are just looking for a place to get a drink and watch a game  go elsewhere. There are probably 20 other restaurants within a 2-minute walk of this place  most of which will be a better food experience.
Dennis T.,Las Vegas  NV,583,24,2,4/9/2015,1.0,The waiter we had was telling us what I wanted to order. I an on a special diet and have ordered this meal for years  no problem. This time it Was a problem and he was not one of the usual waiters that wait on us. We almost walked out until we saw a manager and spoke to him. He said there was no problem and took the order. We also asked for a new server because he had a attitude. He also went to another table telling other people the same thing  I know they did not look happy. If he is my server next time I will go to another station.
Erin M.,Enfield  NH,95,186,27,4/9/2011,4.0,We were heading back to Vegas after a day trip to Red Rock Canyon and decided that rather than dealing with the insanity of eating somewhere on the strip  we'd eat somewhere just outside of it. I pulled up my handy-dandy Yelp app on my phone and found BJ's. After a few wise cracks about how with a name like BJ's  it has to be good  and then proceeded to navigate our immature selves there.We were seated right away and our waiter was friendly. We ordered a couple of beers and the potstickers for an app  and decided to keep it simple with a cheese and tomato deep dish pizza. Both the beer and food we had were quite tasty. Back home  the only option we have for Chicago deep dish style pizza is Uno's  and this definitely beat that by a landslide. It made us want to go to Chicago someday so we can try the real deal for a basis of comparison!Overall  it was a nice  inexpensive  quick  and tasty alternative to dining on The Strip!
Robert H.,Las Vegas  NV,12,17,5,1/10/2014,5.0,The pulled pork sandwich was really good. Wife got California chicken sandwich and tomatoe bisque soup which she really enjoyed. We are here for lunch on a Friday and they are very busy. All in all  a good place. They also have a big drink selection. Would be a good place to come for happy hour. They new their own beer and have a huge selection.
Bruce G.,Las Vegas  NV,47,23,,11/24/2011,4.0,BJ's is a standard fall back restaurant when we cannot decide as a family on some other place. We all love BJ's but I just cannot give this type of restaurant 5 stars. It would be hard pressed for me to give any bar restaurant a 5 star rating so 4 is really good. My kids love the deep dish pizza and I love several items on their menu. The balsamic chicken is awesome  but make sure you order it with extra fried onions. The French dip is also very good. It's a must to order their pizookie . This is a fresh baked cookie (warm) in a circular metal tin with a scoop of ice cream on top. Several cookies to choose from. They are all amazing.  Great place to go to and watch a sporting event as they have TV's throughout the restaurant. Enjoy!
Max B.,Rochester  NY,2,87,5,5/6/2013,3.0,If you're looking for a large beer selection  including some they make themselves  this place will do. The food  on the other hand  is not so great. The menu is like that of many chain restaurants in that its huge and covers various types of cuisine. Everything sounds delicious but rarely seems to be. Deep dish pizza's - 5/10 - more like a standard pizza hut pizza and nothing like a real deep dish pizzaWings - 6/10 - not bad  but would be much better with more sauce
Chris A.,Las Vegas  NV,838,404,1330,11/18/2010,4.0,I really love my NY style pizza...thin  crispy crust...not too much toppings to weigh it down. But man  BJ's Chicago style pizza gives it a run for its money! I enjoy the pizza here and apparently a lot of other folks do too. This place is always packed for dinner! Very happening. Went here with the fam  and we had a blast. It was great hearing the game on the TV  people congregating and laughing  plates and glasses clinking. The atmosphere is pretty inviting  lots of dark woods and high ceilings almost reminding you of a gastropub. BJ's has a very large menu that includes appetizers  salads  sandwiches  Angus burgers  sliders  giant stuffed potatoes  pasta  and even a gluten-free menu (no gluten  in a pizza joint? Come on! It's pizza!)...but the Chicago pizza is the star.I pretty much perused the main menu and went straight for the heart  BJ's wonderful deep dish pizzas. They usually have at least 8-9 different pies on the menu and of course you can make your own with any of their ingredients. Every pizza comes with their special blend of FIVE cheeses. Their pizza creations include - BJ's Favorite Pizza (The Works w/ meatballs  pepperoni  Italian sausage  peppers  olives  onions  and tomatoes)  Mediterranean (Grilled chicken  basil pesto  roasted garlic  Kalamata olives  sun-dried tomatoes  and feta)  Sweet Pig (Pineapple  tomatoes  and roasted ham)  BBQ Chicken (BBQ chicken  red onions  tomatoes  hickory BBQ sauce  and cilantro)  and the Southwestern (Blackened chicken  green chiles  chipotle sauce  cheddar cheese  tomatoes  and cilantro) just to name a few. They even have calzones  and yes...a gluten-free thin crust pizza! I feel so sorry for you people that can't handle gluten. No deep dish for you!We ended up with a large BJ's Favorite pizza for all of us to share. Just to let you know they aren't cheap  probably around $10-24 each depending on the size and type of pie you get (Mini  Small  Medium  or Large). Mind you  these pizzas don't look large when they get to the table but they are DEEP. It's like a good almost two inches thick! I thought our family of four could finish the entire pie in one sitting but I was wrong! Our pie had six large slices and we could only eat a slice each! You definitely have to eat this pizza with a knife and fork...no folding slices in half folks! The crust is buttery  not too heavy  and completely cooked through without being soggy. The ingredients were fresh  and the veggies still had a light bite to them. The sauce was tangy and sweet. Overall a very delicious slice of pie! Yes  like pie! Very good pizza.We rounded out our dinner with a few appetizers  the Crispy Calamari ($8.95) with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli  and the Garden Medley Salad ($8.95) with romaine lettuce  artichoke hearts  roasted red peppers  tomatoes  red onion  feta  and balsamic vinaigrette. Both very tasty.Although we were stuffed (ha ha...like pie?) our server told us we had to try BJ's Famous Pizookie ($5.95). After rants from the kids on how we never have dessert it ended up being ordered. Funny how they win and you don't even realize it. This thing ended up being delicious! Like sweet crack! Not that I've tried crack before. The Pizookie is a hot out of the oven  fresh baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and served in it's own mini deep dish tin. We got a chocolate chunk cookie  but you can also choose  white chocolate macadamia nut  peanut butter  or oatmeal raisin walnut. So good! They bake the cookie dough until it's just a smidge underdone so your cookie is still gooey on the inside. Goes great with the vanilla ice cream on top! Good way to go to end a calorie busting meal! I wanted to try one of their hand crafted micro brews but I couldn't fit it in on this trip. I hear they also have a great happy hour M-F from 3 PM-7 PM and also on Sun-Th from 10 PM-close. They have $1 their draft beers and cocktails  $2 off most of their appetizers  and 1/2 off all their Mini Pizzas. I will have to go check this out on maybe a game day! I definitely want to go back here again soon  good food  good service  good times. Go here  and enjoy yourself before the crazy holidays! BJ's has made me a fan of Chicago deep dish pizza. NY pizza I love you so...Chicago deep dish  you can be my secret mistress! SHHHHHH!!!
Marcus L.,Las Vegas  NV,62,115,4,4/12/2013,4.0,I have visited this location a handful of times since moving out here. I became a fan of BJ's ever since I gave one a try back in Hawaii. Imagine my excitement when I found out they have a few here(And in Cali)! I've taken a few friends here and it's been a pleasant experience each time. Good food  drinks and service.Big fan of their deep dish pizzas. They do have hand tossed as a pizza option now. Prices are about average for this type of venue  not real pricey but not cheap. It is also a brewery  so they make their own brews  even root beer and cream sodas.They do currently have some specials. 2 for $19.95 meal which includes 2 salad or soups  a medium pizza and a pizookie for dessert. Also some lunch specials starting at $6. They do have other items like sandwiches and entrees but honestly  I've never gotten past their pizzas yet hehe. If you have a craving for some good brews n pizzas  definitely not a bad place to stop by!
Yasmin H.,Summerlin  Las Vegas  NV,2,1,1,1/29/2014,4.0,It was good. I went to my friend's birthday dinner and I liked their pizza. I didn't order anything because that's what we had.
Mat J.,Henderson  NV,88,149,13,11/11/2011,4.0,So we go here with my parents a lot. The pizza is pretty good and the atmosphere is generally pretty good. TVs everywhere so you can watch a game and still focus on the people in your group. Their beer is pretty good and very reasonably priced and there is almost always some sort of special going on. My only complaint is that the Vegas locations don't have nutritional guides on hand. They are readily available in California so why not Nevada?
Amanda N.,Las Vegas  NV,6,22,9,9/21/2011,5.0,This place is always poppin!!!! I love it here and the food is great! The one thing i wish was different is the parking... I have been coming here for years and parking is always an issue.Some of my favorite dishes include the french dip  the bbq chicken salad  and the balsamic glazed chicken. The pazookis arent bad either;)
Brandie D.,Northwest  Las Vegas  NV,1,8,2,1/25/2013,5.0,My boyfriend and I went to eat at this location last night and I had such a great experience  as always! Our waiter was quick  kind  and genuine! I can not have gluten so I love going to BJs for their gluten free pizza. Last nights pizza was the best ever. I had a great time and left completely satisfied. Will be back very soon!
Joe T.,Las Vegas  NV,45,157,12,8/9/2013,4.0,Always have great service at the bar. Bison burger is good along with the shrimp lettuce wraps. Plenty of beers to try on hand from tap to bottles if u like to try different beers
Ami M.,Las Vegas  NV,66,26,9,2/9/2013,4.0,Great deep dish pizza! For some reason I thought the smaller pizzas off the bar menu tasted better than the same type of pizza  but larger size off the reg menu. Go figure.
Arielle M.,Chantilly  VA,0,4,,2/10/2014,1.0,It's not a busy day  and I seated myself at the bar for a quick lunch. For the first 15 mins no one wiped the table I sat at  never got handed a menu or silverware. Ever!!!! I got it all myself and I still could have had an attitude. But I didn't however I will never come here again.
Rey A.,Las Vegas  NV,4,12,,1/9/2011,5.0,"Much better that I expected from a ""brewhouse"".Although kind of a loud place  the great food at a great price (and of course great beers) while being family-friendly makes it a hit. A great price for Summerlin as well  I expected to pay much more. The casual contemporary decor is also done well  if you like that kind of style."
Ember H.,Reno  NV,81,24,1,1/31/2013,4.0,Long wait  but the food has never disappointed. I give it to the staff though- they started handing out complimentary pizza after we waited for 30 min :)
Jason B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,4,,5/31/2012,4.0,Yo. I'm going to go against my own lame criteria and review a restaurant that is a huge chain. This place is pretty damn good. I've been there about 5 times and each one has been met with very nice staff  solid food  and great service. Try the steaks. I get the New York strip usually and it's always cooked perfect (order medium usually). HUGE PORTIONS!! You may enter a booth  eat  then have to sleep over because your stomach has created a seal against the table that you cannot break. I'm not a big fan of the pizzas as I think they are too doughy. But pizza is a thing  much like the name of this restaurant  where I've really never had a bad one. So  you may really enjoy it. Also get the rootbeer. You MAY get diabeetus after finishing off a couple of mugs  but it will be worth it. So yeah  don't eat for a week before going. Let's all get some BJ's!!
mick m.,Las Vegas  NV,57,145,2,6/14/2011,4.0,First time to BJ's  glad they are opening a store up north on Centennial!!This place was awosome...Monday nite visit  place was jammed  but only had a 15 min wait. Very nice decor  very expansive therefore very loud. Server was great...beer selection is huge  took sometime to select a few brews. Ordered a two appitizers  potstickers/avacado spring roles both were really good. Ordered a Southwestern pizza  more than enough for two people  actually took 4 pieces home.Finished off w/ a pazookie..1st time it was wonderful. Somehow would like it if the could create a creme brule pazzokie!!...For being a chain they are years ahead of TGIF Applebees etc.......Great for brews and food
Trina T.,Las Vegas  NV,242,499,915,4/28/2011,4.0,I try to avoid places like this because they usually serve greasy  crappy  frozen dookie on a plate. I was pleasantly surprised by their menu and beer selections. They have good food at great prices.If you want bar food done right with a good beer  stop here.
Chan L.,Las Vegas  NV,50,319,2,7/3/2013,4.0,"- Valid thru 7 Jul there\'s a ""Celebrate BBQ at BJ\'s with a FREE ENTREE of equal/lesser value with purchase of an entree!"" offer you can obtain by clicking on it at facebook.com/BJsRestaura- Great beer & lunch meal specials  convenient location near Costco  Lowe\'s  Best Buy  etc.- Friendly service  nice decor and reasonable prices."
Bobby S.,Las Vegas  NV,54,98,,10/27/2010,5.0,I never have a bad experience at Bj's. I love everything about it from the layout all the way down to the Pizookie! The microbrews are great. I really like how they suggest certain foods with the different beers they offer.The pizza's are great. I have never been to Chicago  but it's nice to be able to get a deep dish only a few miles from where I live. The pizza's may not look gigantic but don't let that fool you they are feeling. The staff are awesome the place is always clean and there is always A nice buzz in the place. There hasn't been a single time that when someone suggests Bj's I say no. The place is great.
Charles D.,Las Vegas  NV,4,16,1,1/9/2013,5.0,Keisha was our server. Excellent service and food
Paul M.,Columbus  GA,49,35,11,5/13/2011,4.0,I actually wish Yelp offered a half-star rating  because this place should really get 3 and a half in my book. I came here last night for dinner and left pretty pleased actually. I had a couple of hefeweizens which were quite good but I really prefer mine with a lemon. I had the grilled turkey cobb which was very good and finished it off with a white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. The pazookie was good  though not as thick as I anticipated. I really enjoyed the vanilla bean ice cream topper though - very nice touch.Service was good and fast. They also have a take out entrance. I'll eat here again  though it was a little pricey for me. I do think the beer was a little overpriced  but it wasn't happy hour either.
Jenn B.,Henderson  NV,1,49,54,11/20/2013,4.0,Great food and service. I called ahead to make reservations and the host was very informative and friendly. The waitress was wonderful and attentive. A little expensive but yummy overall.
Laura S.,Las Vegas  NV,107,8,,11/12/2011,5.0,As a family we love BJ's. Every time we have family members or friends visit us from another state  we bring them here. Service is amazing  staff is knowledgeable and fun  and the food is always hot and fresh and delicious.But here's why I recommend them and what prompted this review:BJ's is always busy. (Use their call-ahead program where you can add your name to the wait list before you arrive.) One Friday night  we were waiting in the small reception area for a table  a wait we expected and didn't mind knowing that the food and service would be well worth it. Unfortunately  our wait began going over the initial wait time quoted to us by the hostess. In fact  it was beginning to be significantly over and the very  very  very  very tiny waiting area was now becoming quite packed with other families and people waiting for their tables as well.Looking over the dining room it appeared that it wasn't the servers' or restaurant's fault. Many tables had paid checks on the table and were cleared  except for some napkins and lingering drinks. The guests were just camping out at tables  ignoring the growing group of families with whining  hungry kids.But the managers didn't ignore us. In fact  two different food runners were sent out to the group of waiting people (both inside and outside the restaurant) with trays of pizza cut up in small portions for the kids to munch on while we waited. Napkins were provided and no mention of payment was ever made. This act was by far the kindest  most thoughtful gesture I have ever witnessed by a restaurant. As a parent  I was deeply appreciative of this simple  yet thoughtful gesture on the part of the restaurant. As a 12-year veteran of the industry who has worked as a corporate trainer for two major national chains and is married to a chef  I was greatly impressed by the amazing attention to this matter and quick resolution. We had been entertaining the idea of leaving and going somewhere we didn't like as much  just to get some food in our crabby  hungry toddler's tummy. But this act on the part of BJ's staff kept us there and our money in their hands. Great job!We were huge fans of BJ's before this event  but whenever asked about a good family restaurant  I quickly recount this story and lay on the great reviews.Thanks  BJ's. We're fans for life!
Stephanie E.,Las Vegas  NV,75,34,33,8/21/2012,2.0,"The thing I liked most about this place was the choice of beers. Other than that it was nothing special. My boyfriend and I shared a mushroom and sausage pizza and each of us got a side salad as well. The salad tasted like the ones that you buy in the pre-mixed bags  flavorless and too wet. The pizza was very comparable to Pizza Hut. Its a shame they compare it to Chicago style deep dish pizza because it doesnt even come close to that!!I liked the atmosphere and size of the restaurant. The service was pretty bad. We called while in the parking lot because it looked really busy but the hostess tells us theres no wait for 2 people. So we walk in and she says it\'ll be about 5 minutes. We could clearly see theres several open tables but whatever. We stand there and 5 minutes later she decides to tell us ""oh  you can just go seat yourself over there"" Ummm okay. Our server was very nice but I could tell he had more tables then he could handle because after he took our order we didnt see him again for 20 minutes. We finished our beer and never got asked if we wanted another. My glass of water remained empty for about 20 minutes. If he was a bit more attentive I would\'ve enjoyed my experience a lot more. Medium pizza  2 side salads  one pint of beer  and the sampler of 4 beers ($6.00) was $40. All in all  it was nothing special. It tasted like Pizza Hut on a good night but tripple the price!!"
George H.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,,12/23/2013,4.0,This place is always consistent. Good food and beer.
Tim J.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,2,10/12/2013,1.0,Blown away at horrible my experience! I'll keep it short as I don't want to waste any more of my time in this place. I took my wife and her parents and we went on a Sat afternoon - busy but not incredibly busy. What went wrong?? .....ordered a bowl of soup and received a cup (without soup crackers). I had to track down server and tell him. He said he would bring another cup...it never came. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it came out with LESS THAN ROOM TEMP fries. If that wasn't enough...the grilled sourdough from the sandwich was COLD!! Needless to say  I provided feedback  did not accept any other food or compensation and will NEVER return! Even though I can't stand Denny's I would have rather eaten there!!! YUCK! Save your money and avoid this place!
Stace S.,Pasadena  CA,53,46,9,6/25/2011,4.0,Love this place. The staff has always been friendly and the service really good. Parking is a pain in the butt during peak hours. This is a go to place for us and it's never disappointed.
Myrna M.,Westside  Las Vegas  NV,2,7,,4/4/2014,3.0,"The only reason I\'m giving three stars is because of the food  which was amazing  but the service really took away from the overall experience. I understand that establishments are weary to serve teenagers  but that\'s no reason to be treated like we\'re below the status of a regular customer. Every time our server spoke to us  I felt like we were being scoffed at. Not every teenager tips just below the minimum  so if that was the reason why the service was horrible  you won\'t be seeing me or my family here anytime soon. My party isn\'t stupid  we know the norms of tipping and dining out. I was excited to bring my foreign exchange student here to enjoy the highly regarded burgers  but the embarrassment my whole party experienced overshadowed it all. the waiter actually had the guts to scream at her because she couldn\'t hear him when he brought all the food to our table. first of all  the place is always filled with people  resulting in a volume problem. Second  she doesn\'t speak good English! we seriously had to endure him directly shouting at her and giving us attitude when she didn\'t speak up saying it wasn\'t her food  even going as far as to say ""you need to speak up next time."" I haven\'t even stopped laughing because  really  this will be the last time me and my party will dine here after this experience. Bj\'s should know not every patron is the same  so why were we treated like every other teenager who dines out? pathetic."
Amy H.,Las Vegas  NV,2,19,,9/15/2013,4.0,We discovered BJ's one night when we wanted to go to Dos Caminos  only to find it closed. However  BJ's was a wonderful surprise and our new go-to when we want good food and to stay close to home.My favourite beer is the hefewisen (I'm not sure about the spelling). I mentioned to the waiter that I liked Blue Moon and Shocktop  he suggested that beer  and I'm now hooked. The pizza  calzones  and burgers are awesome. My dad even orders a pizza and a burger because they are both so tasty  he takes one home to eat later!The service has always been prompt and friendly  it's not too loud or crowded  the TVs are plentiful and high enough so everyone has a good view of whatever game is going on  and the prices are reasonable  especially for Summerlin. Our new favourite hangout :)
Tyler M.,Las Vegas  NV,31,9,,11/24/2013,2.0,"Placed an online to go order. Ordered a half sandwich and a house salad and a grilled BBQ pasta with a house salad. The total was $24. Yes  $24 for two lunch specials. Specials are typically discounted hence the ""special"" label. They obviously don\'t get that part or that\'s why they don\'t advertise the prices online. Went to pick up my order and found all of the to go order parking spots taken with no one in their cars and no one inside waiting for their orders. The food was good but not great. I suggest skipping their online ordering set up all together. It\'s not worth it"
Shannon S.,Las Vegas  NV,145,377,17,8/29/2012,5.0,Love the late happy hour  especially when I'm craving a Jerry Burst! Food and service are always good.
Tom R.,Las Vegas  NV,2,4,3,9/4/2014,5.0,My wife and I go here quite a bit and always receive great service and perfect food. The deep dish pizza is always prepared just right. We usually split the santa fe chicken salad as well and have not been disappointed.
Bill Y.,Las Vegas  NV,1,20,4,4/16/2013,4.0,I have eaten there a few times  i have had the rib eye with baked potato  that tater was huge  rib eye had good flavor and it was medium rare as I ordered. I have also had the bbq chicken salad and sante fe salad as well as the wings  all delicious and not only that but the p lace can be packed and you still get your food fast and hot. Worth trying for sure
Tina S.,Las Vegas  NV,34,91,14,11/10/2010,3.0,Have eaten here a number of times. Their Sunday brunch was excellent  their regular menu is good  nothing too memorable except for the pizookie. Service was excellent this last visit for brunch. Would go here again.
Audra R.,Orange County  CA,530,855,157,12/28/2010,5.0,It's odd coming from CA  service at restaurants in Vegas is WAY SUPERIOR. It's not suzy moron college student serving you  it's people that have spouses and families trying to make a decent living.So yeah excellent service. Layout and seating great at this location. Lettuce wraps were off the hook! And they now have a child sized pizzooki HELL YEAH!
Neal S.,Denton  TX,9,38,,5/28/2012,2.0,Why go here?  Seriously.  Everything here is about as exciting as the Cheesecake Factory. And by that I mean there is no taste  no excitement  and no flavor. But for those of you who like safe dependable food that fails to deliver an iota of anything unique  this place is for you. As I struggle to find something good to say about this place  I guess I will mention that the service is always bright and cheerful. Of course bright and cheerful service is over rated in my world. For those of you who enjoy unblemished mediocrity I encourage you to eat here.
L J.,Independence  OH,0,7,,10/21/2014,1.0,Server took ten minutes to come to the table. Spinach dip came out very cold. How hard is it to microwave? Meal came out wrong as well. Overall  generic and poor execution.
Eric S.,Las Vegas  NV,787,424,57,5/12/2012,4.0,"BJ\'s is a fun place to go if you aren\'t on a diet. I am not certain there is anything on the menu that is a healthy choice  even items listed as a healthy choice. BUT  if you go there for the food  you won\'t be disappointed. From their Avacodo Egg Rolls to their Chicago-esque pizza  they know how to make their food. They recently added ""small plates"" to their menu  8 -10 mini appetizers for between 2-4 dollars each. We decided to sample as many as we could and ordered Thai won tons  meatballs  a mozzerella salad  and fried artichokes. The Artichokes were surprisingly good with large pieces of artichoke beneath a breading that didn\'t zap the flavor of the choke. The dipping sauce was good but not perfect. The meatballs failed miserably as they stunk like yesterday\'s laundry. They tasted ok but the smell really curdled our appetite. Luckily the Thai chicken won tons were excellent. Add to that a wedge salad  housebrewed root beer and cream soda  and a kids meal and the three of us got out for under $40.00 with full tummies! And the kids Pazooki comes with their meal and is big enough fo the adults to sample without stuffing it in."
Traci H.,Las Vegas  NV,2,115,2,2/11/2013,5.0,Great pizza! Love their locally-brewed root beer. Fun for the kids too.
Kailey G.,Southwest  Las Vegas  NV,18,18,3,5/21/2013,5.0,My boyfriend and I love going to yard house. The food is great and the service is great as well. Our waiter Name was April sunshine  And she was the best! she had the best customer service  She was friendly and nice. We are definitely asking for her next time we go.
Fred F.,Las Vegas  NV,47,227,,8/10/2012,1.0,I'm prejudice against chains already but I just don't understand how this place stays busy. The pizza dough is literally the old Pizza Hut pan pizza recipe. It's expensive and nasty.
Thao T.,Las Vegas  NV,56,58,18,3/2/2010,4.0,"The highlight: Wine half off on Tuesdays. That\'s a deal. It goes for both bottles and by the glass. I believe the special applies all day long and not only during happy hour (3-7pm). They have the basics: their ""house wine"" is barefoot (listed at $19/bottle) but with the special it comes out to be very similar to what you can get it for at Trader Joe\'s.  I shared the homemade Kettle Style Potato chips ($3): good choice.I also shared the flatbread Margherita Fresca pizza which I don\'t strongly recommend; It was $9 and barely any tomatoes. Mainly just cheese with specs of tomatoes. I just ate here earlier today and had a great time. There\'s a good overall ambiance with the music  the service  and the continuous crowd coming in and out (It\'s a tuesday evening and it was still crowded by 10PM). I probably would come back because of it\'s convenient location  minimal wait and decent prices."
Mike L.,Seaside  CA,35,151,87,7/18/2010,5.0,BJs Pizza....In the words of Bret Hart  the best there is  the best there was  the best there ever will be. There may be a bit of hyperbole there  but damn  I'd be hard-pressed to say that ive ever tried a better pizza and thats saying something since this is a chain.I've been frequenting both the San Jose  Roseville and Las Vegas locations (yeah  i get around) for almost four years and finally have the sense of mind to review it. Whats nice about this place is that no matter which location you go to  you can always expect consistency. Great ambiance  great food and great fun are to be had at each location and you can really tell the company strives for it.Where to start  oh yeah  PIZZA! The pizza is amazing. It is the deep dish style not to be confused with the stuffed type youd get at Zacharys in the yay area or Giordano's in the Chi.The pizza is baked to perfection  has the right bit of crunch to it and is just generally good all over. The sandwiches  beer and desserts are nothing to scoff at either. Please try a Pizookie if you ever get the opportunity. I'd rank it right up there with the White Molten Chocolate Cake (believe it or not) at Chili's or the Brownie Sundae at MRKT inside the Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas.Do yourself a favor  eat at BJ's.
Brandon A.,Las Vegas  NV,0,13,,2/23/2013,5.0,I go here a lot  it's one of my favorite restaurants. Everything I have gotten here is amazing.One of my favorites is the Parmesan crusted chicken  the pizza is also great any day. But when you are there you must get the pizookie  it's a gift from above. Deep dish cookie with cool sweet ice cream on top is a great dessert for any time of the year. And to drink they brew their own root beer and cream sodas  also as you may guess it is off the wall good. In my book BJ's is a necessity.
Craig K.,Las Vegas  NV,33,7,2,2/21/2013,5.0,So good! This my first time here. Service was awesome. The beers are great. The calamari was good (worst thing I can say). The ribeye with horseradish mash and red wine mushroom sauce was fantastic! Servers name was Carrie. She was absolutely perfect. Quick  on the spot  got the orders right and didn't hover. Great night out with my wife!!!
Chrisjan Y.,Las Vegas  NV,59,207,59,8/11/2010,5.0,It's been awhile since I've eaten at Bj's. I love the Blonde beer. The last time I found hair in my food and the service was great.Yesterday we were there for an early dinner. We grabbed some calamari  avocado egg rolls and the sampler. Then 2 mini pizza's. Everything was excellent! Especially the service! I will be back to eat here again.
Denise N.,Boulder  CO,38,37,14,1/7/2010,4.0,We were pretty pleased with the food  drinks & service at BJ's. Typically when me & the hubster are in Vegas we're visiting family so we tend to stay away from the Strip and just relax... which is sometime hard in Vegas. BJ's is so chill it's easy to feel comfortable. Though its a chain restaurant  they've hit the nail on the head with stellar service and strong drinks. Lots of beer choices and like Ken. M said  they're one seasonal beer on tap is a killer hit (at least with my hubby!) I had one of the strongest cosmos Id gotten in a long time and that was perfectly fine with me considering we were there with the in-laws ;)Nonetheless  when you're in Vegas and either want a break from the Strip or just someplace to feel comfortable  watch the game and put a few back  BJ's should be just perfect!
Nick W.,Salt Lake City  UT,26,84,27,1/21/2010,4.0,BJ's is a great place. Great food  great beer  great hand crafted root beer (according to my son ) and great service.BJ's offers healthy size portions (often enough to keep me in left overs for a day or two at our family condo.) I highly recommend any of the specialty salads or the stuffed baked potatoes  which are a meal in themselves.If you are up for some beer - the 7 beer sampler fits the bill to start. I would recommend the Tatonka Stout if you like dark beer. BJ's also offers some hard ciders and regular mixed drinks.Watch for BJ's happy hour - most mini pizzas and appetizers are 1/2 price later in the evening in the bar. BJ's is great for kids and offers several kid's selections (that are adult size meals.) Most come with an included drink - my son always gets the handcrafted root beer  which is a lot better than the other soft drinks.Grab a bit at BJ's - you won't be disappointed. They have a great take out too if you want to avoid the line.
Mary Beth A.,Canmore  Canada,0,19,,4/8/2013,4.0,Excellent service and the place was packed! Our server Christy D. was on it. She checked on us regularly and we never felt neglected though we could tell she was slammed. We requested 2 beer samples and she brought a third she thought we might like. We did and ordered a pitcher of it. We ordered avocado egg rolls & the BJ's bacon cheeseburger pizza and the food was very tasty.
Lindsey B.,Las Vegas  NV,103,248,17,11/30/2009,5.0,My husband and I come here probably once a week. Where do I begin?!Below is what we LOVE:1. Apps:-Potato Skins-Chicken Pot Stickers-Avocado Egg Rolls-Chicken Wings-Chips & Salsa (yes  their salsa is good!)2. Salads:-Caesar Salad (with chicken)-Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad-Santa Fe Salad3. Pasta:-Angel Hair Toscana-Grilled Chicken Pasta4. Entrees:-Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast (SO GOOD! My husband get's this almost everytime!)5. Sandwiches:-Angus Roast Beef Dip-Crispy ChickenWe actually haven't had their pizza  but all our friends say they are delicious! We always love what we get  so its hard to try new things.If you have room for desert (servings are VERY generous) then you gotta try the Pizookie. Huge cookie with ice cream.Great Beer & Drink Menu. Casual  so you can come in your jeans.They have something for everyone... I'm sure we will be there again this week!
S K.,Los Angeles  CA,0,23,,9/9/2012,4.0,I recently moved to the area and while getting unpacked and settled  I grabbed take out from here about twice/week. I tried similiar type restaurants in the area (i..e  Claim Jumper) but have found the quality of food and friendliness of staff much stronger here than other places. There have a been a few issues - one time  despite waiting to pick up for until the 15-20 minute ready time  my order hadn't been put in yet. Another time  a salad with the dinner didn't make it into my bag (and I didn't realize this until I got home). Both times  however  the staff was super responsive. With the delayed order  the manager comped the meal without a complaint from me. Likewise with the missing salad - I called and asked them to just make a note for the next time I was going to be in (b/c with boxes still unpacked  it was inevitable I'd be in again) but they comped the entire entree. When I went in the other day  they also gave me a complimentary gift card for future orders. I've not eaten in the restaurant  so I can't attest to the service of the waitstaff (as mentioned by several people in previous posts)  but the take-out order staff is super friendly  accomodating  and easy to deal with. The food is pretty good. It's not fancy  gourmet style. It's quality comfort-type food that's much better than bigger chains (i..e  Applebee's  Chili's). They have the best mashed potatoes in the area. Their salmon is excellent  and the parmasan chicken was really good too. I don't like their fish and chips  but I've not found a local/Summerlin restaurant that does fish and chips well. (But am still looking!) I'd definitely recommend this place and think it has 5-star potential (but need to eat in to find out).
Jerome M.,Santa Ana  CA,118,22,1,12/19/2012,4.0,The atmosphere here was pretty relaxed and they have a wide selection of beers  which is always awesome. Every time I come here the service is always excellent and the food is amazing.
J M.,Las Vegas  NV,689,10,8,7/26/2012,1.0,Dont do it!!! Food poisoning from the happy hour chicken taco's...i would have rather ran a marathon than get that sick ever AGAIN!!!
Jorge L.,Henderson  NV,1,10,21,10/11/2012,1.0,No good customer service even when restaurant is almost empty!!! Left after 10 min waiting in the bar area and it's not the 1st time!!!!
Marie O.,Ypsilanti  MI,19,8,13,11/10/2012,4.0,The BEER is AWESOME! We are beer lovers and this place has a great selection of micro-brew  although a bit pricey at $5 a pint  it is worth it! We ordered the deep dish pizza  half bbq chicken and half white(alfredo)  yeah that's right you can get half and half! It was good  although it seemed like is was just reheated to order and not freshly cooked because it wasn't really hot and you could tell that the halfs had not been cooked together  that was a little disappointing but it still had a good flavor. The cilantro on the bbq chicken was a winner for me  I wasn't that into the white side honestly. The Pazookie's though  holy hot cookie with ice cream on top! We ordered the sampler so we could try 3 different flavors and it was heavenly! If you love beer  go here! But be willing to spend some dough!
Hui P.,Las Vegas  NV,35,7,,9/4/2012,4.0,This is the spot to go! I go there for family dinners  watching a game or just gathering with friends! they have a great variety of food and the staff are very friendly! the deep dished oven pizza is a must try! and their famous dessert poozkie!!!
Andrew R.,Las Vegas  NV,0,15,,1/22/2013,5.0,Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. Food is amazing  the pazooki's are to die for  service is usually pretty good  decor is nice  great looking bar. Not a big drinker but i hear the beers are great! This place is highly recommended.
Max M.,Tulsa  OK,14,16,45,6/2/2011,5.0,"BJ\'s is  and has been for over seven years  my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas; and I have been to A LOT of restaurants all over town. To me  a great restaurant is one that has an enjoyable environment  great food  good service  and fair prices. BJ\'s definitely has all of these qualities. To begin  the environment is very welcoming and well-kept. The restaurant has a big city  Chicago style  feel to it and offers both bar/lounge area seating with a full bar and several flat screen TV\'s all around the restaurant. The dining room offers booth seating for two  four  or up to eight and tables for a small party of a couple friends or a huge party of a high school archery team  (I tried going with something other than football team  you get the point...). The lights are slightly dim to keep the mood somewhat mellow  but the TV\'s and music keep the restaurant upbeat--it\'s a good balance for a good environment. The food at BJ\'s is awesome! They offer a great selection of appetizers which are perfect to share  as well as smaller sized appetizers  ""Tiny Bites "" which make perfect individual appetizers or sides. My personal favorites are the Chicken Pesto flatbread pizza  (appetizer to share)  and the gourmet mac & cheese  (individual ""tiny bite""). As far as the main entrees  BJ\'s offers a wide variety of foods ranging from classic burgers to Italian inspired pastas to Teriyaki Chicken to Grilled Salmon and even some Jambalaya. BJ\'s also has some delectable gourmet salads and wholesome soups. My favorite entre has to be the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. There is a large selection of drinks offered at BJ\'s  from the full bar to specialty drinks  both alcoholic and non  as well as their signature hand-crafted root beer  cream soda  orange cream soda  and black cherry soda.  Now for the good part--the desserts. BJ\'s is known for their pizookies. Pizookies are cookies  baked in a pizza pan  served hot out of the oven with two scoops of ice cream on top. They have the classic Chocolate Chip pizookie with vanilla bean ice cream on top as well as quite a few other flavors such as Triple Chocolate  White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  and  newly added  Red Velvet. There\'s also an Oatmeal Raisin pizookie for those of you who like to feel like you\'re eating healthy even while having dessert. BJ\'s also offers beignets and an ice cream sundae as well as a couple other dessert items. Almost every time I have been to BJ\'s  the staff has been very friendly. Only a couple times have I ever had an issue with a server or host. If my order is ever made incorrectly  which rarely happens  the server will gladly take it back and bring me the correct order as well as give me some sort of compensation  such as a discount or free dessert. The prices are really good for a restaurant such as this one. They have lunch specials during the week which are only about 6-8 dollars. As far as the prices on the regular menu  most of the items range anywhere from 10 to 18 dollars with a few exceptions being slightly higher or lower. In all  BJ\'s is a great place to have a quick lunch  to go on a date  or to take the family out for dinner. It is very unlikely that you will be disappointed with this restaurant  (unless  of course  you are a complete restaurant snob who will complain about the most insignificant things)  and I do hope that you give BJ\'s a visit in the near future."
Nick F.,Ballwin  MO,91,269,2,3/9/2012,3.0,Its BJs  a chain with a obscenely huge menu  which I feel can be a red flag for not fresh food. But it is what it is  just decent bar food  good beers  and usually pretty easy to get in an out of. I dont think I can justify giving a chain 5 stars.
Elbert S.,Las Vegas  NV,27,68,5,5/2/2012,5.0,Had the crispy jalapenos Burger and wedge fries with a few Oasis beers. Devoured and ravaged this burger. Love this place and its pizookie!!!! Service was good just took awhile to get our drink orders.
Leah S.,Las Vegas  NV,40,13,3,5/1/2012,4.0,Ive been here numerous times. A good place for consistent food and drinks when shopping or errands on that side of town.This review is for Friday night with a group of 7 at around 7pm. We were expecting a wait (it's Friday at dinner rush) so my husband & I got there early and ordered drinks at the bar after putting our names on the list. The wait was an hour - typical for a popular restaurant on a Friday night. We enjoyed a glass of Pinot and a house lager before the rest of our party joined us.We were so lucky- an 8 top table in the bar area opened up and we swooped it up! I prefer bar dining  anyways. We are a low maintenance group that understands the workings of a busy restaurant. Our server was friendly and efficient for how busy she was. We ordered the avocado rolls  calamari and boneless buffalo wings for apps. Everyone had beer or cocktails and started Cesar salads. Everything was timed right and satisfying. We ordered 3 pizzas (theirs are deep dish). My husband asked for no tomatoes on ours and they made with tomatoes- but they realized the mistake and started making one without while leaving the pizza with so we weren't eating after the rest of our group. The server was apologetic and the manager brought the correct pizza out when it was ready. They handled the situation correctly and we were happy with the service. For some people this would ruin their dinner... But really- stuff happens  the apologized and fixed it! What more could you ask for?!?
Samantha R.,Las Vegas  NV,48,75,,6/3/2012,2.0,I am not a big fan of this place always way to loud really greasy food and unfriendly staff.
Natasha R.,Las Vegas  NV,76,50,78,9/20/2011,3.0,Yum! The food is great especially the avocado egg rolls!!!Of course the pizookies are awesome. Dont count on great customer service. The hostess are almost never nice but I guess it's so busy that they just don't care. Asked about there happy hour and the sever told me that she didn't know. She didnt even try to find out... Awesome.... They have two different type of fries and they almost always bring my bf the wrong one and he usually doesn't say anything but the last time it happened I politely said they were the wrong ones and the food runner jut picked up the plate without saying anything and walked away. Very awkward. So I usually just try to order to go now since it's usually not a pleasant experience. Maybe it's too busy and the staff is just overworked? Not sure and don't really car.
David W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,,5/21/2014,4.0,This place has awesome food and the prices are very reasonable. They actually have carry out too. They don't advertise the carry out much at all because it is a huge costs savings. I went into the restaurant and ordered food to go and waited for it. What would have cost me roughly $120.00 in the restaurant plus the tip only cost me about $55.00 out the door.  I couldn't believe it. Their pizza is the best that I have had in las vegas and it takes a little bit of time if you order one but it is well worth the wait.
Randy R.,Chicago  IL,7,178,43,12/29/2011,3.0,"I\'ve eaten here several times and the food is decent. Not great  but about average for what you would expect from a chain ""brewpub."" I do enjoy the loaded baked potatoes that they offer and their beers are pretty good."
Nicole P.,Las Vegas  NV,1,6,,9/27/2012,4.0,Love this place! The menu as a nice variety of items and at good prices. My whole family enjoys going there. And I love that they add a rewards card.
Jason F.,Holladay  UT,46,235,119,9/22/2009,4.0,This southern California transplant is a good  fun restaurant. Located across the street from the Red Rock Casino in Summerlin it is nice and new and in a nice part of town. They have a huge selection of beers to choose from. The menu has just about something for everyone. They have lots of deep dish pizzas to choose from as well. The pizza is what they are known for. The service was friendly and fast.BJ's has a desert called a Pizookie  which is a baked cookie topped with two scoops of ice cream and served in a dish.You can choose from chocolate chunk  white chocolate macadamia nut  peanut butter or oatmeal raisin walnut ice cream. Totally not healthy and totally yummy.
Jorj L.,Las Vegas  NV,0,3,,8/3/2010,1.0,The reviews of this place makes me rethink using yelp altogether. The rumors must be true and you can pay to have bad reviews removed. This place is a JOKE! The food. Uninspired TGIF fare. Do we really need another restaurant to do chicken lettuce wraps or avocado egg rolls? WEAK!The fact that this place is crowded makes me sad about our little hamlet called summerlin.The decor is horrendous. A big box warehouse. It's like eating at Costco. No disrespect to Costco.The service. I'll have a double serving of homogenized corporate insincerity.No doubt corporate headquarters has paid the bounty to Yelp to keep this one highly rated. We'll see how long this review lasts.
Hillary S.,Las Vegas  NV,117,56,7,9/20/2011,4.0,We eat here so often  it's only fair that I write a review. When we can't decide where to have dinner  we go to BJ's. They seem to have something to please almost everyone. I usually get the Broccoli Alfredo potato with extra sauce... yum!  Good service  good value. Great place to bump into your Summerlin neighbors. I appreciate that you can call ahead & be placed on the seating list - sometimes the wait can be upwards of 45 minutes  so calling ahead really saves time  especially when I'm with the 10-year old (or if my guy is hungry... and cranky!)
D. L.,Las Vegas  NV,3,36,,5/15/2013,1.0,"I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with well done bacon and american cheese. The burger came out and the bacon was raw so I sent it back 10 mins later the burger comes out  bacon well done but with chedder cheese. The manager comes to the table and said the closet cheese they have to american is chedder so I asked for no cheese the waiter comes to my table and said ""I entered in the computer american cheese"" I explained to the waiter that his manager indicated that BJ\'s doesn\'t offer american cheese so I\'m not sure how you would be able to enter something that you don\'t carry??? Liar!"
Christina R.,Las Vegas  NV,42,19,5,11/14/2013,4.0,I don't personally love chain restaurants  but at least it's always consistent. Tonight we had avocado egg rolls (not as good as Cheesecake Factory) and an individual sized hand tossed pizza. They let us do half BBQ chicken and half spicy meatball. Some places don't let you do half and half if there are two different sauce bases (which is ridiculous  but I appreciate it even more when they do it). Both were good  but the best thing is that we got Happy Hour prices even though we showed up at around 7:15! Our waitress told us that if the game is still on (its Thursday night football)  the HH prices continue. Sweet!
Shige O.,North Las Vegas  NV,498,157,54,4/10/2011,5.0,Food here was totally worth the wait. I must admit the line was quite long. They do not take phone reservations. So i suggest you plan for an off night if your doing a bigger party of 5+. The service here once seated is definitely fast and so is the food. The prices were super reasonable for the amount and the quality of food served. Absolutely one of my new fav. places to eat here in Las Vegas. Dress at your own comfort but i suggest casual as it is not someplace you wana come to in your pajamas. Parking is also very abundant. There alcohol selection is definitely great as well especially if you are a beer fan.
My T.,Las Vegas  NV,209,188,156,8/19/2011,4.0,Since joining Lifetime Athletics  my cravings for carbs have intensified immensely. Growing up in a Vietnamese house hold  you'd think the first thing I go for is white rice or noodles. But you're wrong! My craving is for the Chicken Parm with Spicy Marinara served with garlic toast. It's really the spicy punch of of the sauce and the crispy flattened chicken that scratches my itchin'. If you can make it out of the restaurant without ordering the Pizookie  you can call it a healthy success with dining out.
Juan Diego D.,Las Vegas  NV,2,17,,1/19/2012,5.0,Great place awesome pizza and great beer oh and the red velvet pizookie is out of this world and speedy friendly service
Grace C.,Oakland  CA,54,223,3,7/12/2009,5.0,Where do I begin.....I've been to BJ's many times in Northern California and it's a pretty good restaurant. Anyhow my sis and I were staying at Red Rock and wanted something other than a buffet/fastfood/$$$restaurant so we decided to come here. The food is pretty much the same across the board which is great because I hate inconsistency when it comes to chain restaurants. This restaurant has PHENOMENAL service. The hostess that sat us was very sweet and our server [whose name I'm unsure of] was AMAZING. She was attentive  sweet  and just a great server. We ended up getting a pitcher of beer  artichoke dip/bruschetta  nachos  and a parmesan crusted chicken entree all for under $60! Note: On the check it said our server was Cinnamon. Not sure if that's a birth-given name or a nickname... Cinnamon was the shit!
Rhonda W.,North Las Vegas  NV,87,207,22,7/11/2011,3.0,Hmmm the service was really bad the night I came ... We got our appetizers before we even got our waters ..!! The food tho was decent ... If you come sit at the bar ... Otherwise you'll be totally ignored by your server!
Viki M.,Las Vegas  NV,31,21,1,9/20/2011,5.0,Best Brewery in Town. Great Beer  Great Food  Great Service! We had the Pizza Deal thay have and The Portabello Mushroom Pizza was to die for.......so juicy and yummy!  My boyfriend had the Cheeseburger Pizza  which he loved - I'm not a huge fan  I pefer a cheeseburger if I'm in thw mood. However  there is something for everybody there  and a wide variety of beers! Thank you BJ's for a special night out with my man
Taylor L.,McKinney  TX,145,32,45,1/7/2011,3.0,This is a reliable spot near my house  but it certainly isn't anything special. The prices are a great value  but the wait on the weekends is beyond ridiculous and the parking situation is a deterrent. My favorite thing is the Gourmet Mac and Cheese on the small appetizer menu. Food tastes a little processed and unhealthy  but it is basically all bar food.
Tiana H.,Austin  TX,1020,568,256,8/11/2010,5.0,Mmmmmm. Can you say Pizookie?! Giant Stuffed Potato?! Seriously some really good food. Great prices. Currently they have a 2 for 19.99 special: 2 soups or salad  a medium specialty pizza  and a pizookie! I was stuffed  and when I left  my wallet still was. I go here at least a few times a month  and never have been disappointed! Better than Chili's  and come in at a tie with Cheesecake Factory for best cheap  date night eats :)
William J.,Los Angeles  CA,7,40,5,10/15/2011,5.0,BJ:Fantastic happy hours.Fast service.Great food.Service:Outstanding.I really have nothing negative to say about BJ!!!Cheers
Trish B.,Las Vegas  NV,77,44,37,6/17/2011,4.0,Love the fried artichokes and Parmesan crusted chicken! It's all I order!
Tom A.,Los Angeles  CA,196,121,1,5/21/2011,3.0,Bar food style place ... Good service. Note to self: return for the Avocado Rolls  skip the other 3 items in the 4 item appetizer sampler. Pizza is OK  but Chicago deep dish is not my favorite style. Menu is so extensive  I'll have to go back a few times to figure out what I like.
Theodora K.,Las Vegas  NV,0,8,,1/15/2014,3.0,I've been there twice and looks ok. Nothing special to me  decent food  good beer but I am not going craze for it!. Fried calamari a bit greasy but tasty  fish tacos ok  steak was very good. I love coffee and they don't serve cappuccino. Great service!
Angelita G.,Las Vegas  NV,19,31,,7/21/2009,5.0,Every single time I go here everyone from the host to the servers remember my name and my drink  and I only go there 2-3 times a month. I usually go during happy hour for their half off mini pizzas which are to die for!! The BBQ chicken cannot be beat  I have 99% of the time. Plus  their pizookie is AMAZING!! I will miss this joint when I move back to Green Valley but they just opened a new in Henderson. GO to this place if you want happy servers/bartenders  awesome music that isn't too loud for conversation  and a huge food selection.Like most places  it's a madhouse after 6!
Jesse K.,Las Vegas  NV,21,143,5,7/18/2011,4.0,I'm going to give them a four star rating because of their pazookie dessert. If you haven't tried or heard about a pazookie you must check it out. It's one of the most delicious desserts in town. It's a homemade cookie I. A deep dish pizza pan cooked 3/4 of the way through top end with a n amazing vanilla ice-cream. The bar is hopping with dozens of beer options on tap and in bottles. Menu is huge and all over the place  I'm not a big fan of the entrees. Apps are good and dessert is fantastic!
Malcom S.,Las Vegas  NV,66,12,5,9/25/2011,5.0,Man I forgot how good the pizza was. It was thick crunch yet soft. My wife and I will definitely go back. And the service was good. I think our server was over sat with customers but he did his best to make it pleasant.
Oakley G.,Las Vegas  NV,7,32,1,12/17/2011,3.0,Food is fine. Atmosphere is casual. Beer selection was limited. I consider it a decent place for bite but  nothing memorable. They do have a wide selection of entrees if you have a large hard to please group.
Stephanie S.,Seattle  WA,344,221,27,12/28/2008,3.0,Good chain. Pretty fast. The deep dish pizzas aren't really deep dish like Chicago (saucy and soupy) more like a pan crust pizza from pizza hut but still pretty good to eat and definitely better than the average Chicago want to be. Haven't had the beer here but they have a great happy hour around 5. Biggest recommendation would be to order the world famous pizzuki  a giant cookie in a skillet covered in ice cream. Wow.
Stacey G.,Carol Stream  IL,5,19,,8/22/2008,4.0,I come to this place every time I visit Vegas. The beers are good. The food is great and reasonably priced My personal favorite is the pesto cilantro pizza  but I have really liked everything I've had there.It is a really fun place to hang out at the bar. My favorite bartender there  Mike  is quite the charmer. It's always nice to be flirted with  even if you are old enough to be his..uh.. slightly older sister.I had to take away one star because the kitchen and bar close way too early.
Bryan S.,Las Vegas  NV,15,240,34,2/17/2011,3.0,The pizza is always good  but when you use fresh jalapenos on something use them sparingly! Went there for lunch yesterday and while they seemed staffed service was slow. At one point it took 10 min to get a refill on water!
Mary H.,Las Vegas  NV,1,16,1,10/29/2013,5.0,I love this place! I've been here a number of times and the food and service is always good. Lot's of different choices on the menu  and their pizookie's are amazing!!
Richard N.,Las Vegas  NV,13,54,,8/20/2008,4.0,"Pretty slick place! (I felt under dressed in my shorts  no worries though)Nice room. Will seat 100+. Someone paid attention to details here!Great graphics on the walls  the logo\'s for their homebrew styled beers are excellent. Meaning they make you want to order and drink them (thats what a good logo does) bjsrestaurants.com/list. Well crafted brews I will add. 7 are on tap year round with an additional 10+ specialty (seasonal) brews. ex: Pumpkin Ale  and Oktoberfest Marzen coming Oct./Nov.It\'s a large menu. Listing Cocktails and Wines throughout the Beers  Appetizers  Soups/Salads  Pizza  Burgers  Pastas  Entrees  and into the Kid\'s Menu. Tip: Dessert  try the PIZOOKIE!! don\'t ask  just Do It!Nice Bar too. You are welcome to eat a full menu there. But  before 7pm daily all appetizers 1/2 off (bar only) just an fyi. So I am told. I did not do this this visit. bjsrestaurants.com/begin (Sliders (4) Angus Beef is $7.95 w/ fries take 1/2 off before 7pm) Service was excellent. Food was good. Interesting variety well executed.Big room  and it was filling to Full by 7pm  noise was very tolerable.So if you find yourself on the westside near Red Rock Casino  BJ\'s is across the street. Easy parking. And they also have have ""Curbside pick up"" for To-Go ordering bjsrestaurants.com/curbsHours:11am-10 pm Sun-Thurs11am- 11pm Fri-SatNo gaming that I saw either. (Nice break) 2 Nevada locations and plenty more bjsrestaurants.com/locat"
Angela S.,Dallas  TX,115,51,41,1/26/2011,5.0,Stopped in before work to grab something and they had a veggie burger... It was so good... If you aren't that big on eating meat or just want a good veggie burger... Go to BJ's... The potatoes are really good too...
Candace P.,Las Vegas  NV,1,24,,4/12/2011,4.0,Great service  great food and great atmosphere!They have a wide variety of stuff on the menu ranging from bar fare to tapas style smaller plates to specialty drinks and some great desserts.We started with the fried artichokes - crispy on the outside  tender on the inside. The aoili dipping sauce was perfect.I dined on the open faced pot roast sandwich which was super tender. It actually tasted home cooked. It was served over garlic toast and mashed potatoes and covered in a brown jus gravy. Mmmmmm. Seriously yummy.For dessert we had the beignet. Um  yes. YES. It was covered in real strawberries and whipped cream and ice cream and was friggin' delicious.This place was a nice surprise.
J J.,Chicago  IL,0,84,,11/15/2011,3.0,Consistently average. The best part of the place is the beer flights. For the brews alone it is worth a visit.
Michael H.,Las Vegas  NV,2,5,,7/2/2010,4.0,This is one of my sister & mine favorite places to munch... We went tonight & only had beers... while we normally we eat & indulge in the wicked selection of draft brews... from their house brews to the wide selection of more comerial beers... I don't think I drink the same beer twice in a visit...as always the service was awesome... never had an empty glass... the check was under 20 bucks for 6 beers.... not bad... now I've never sat any where but the bar so all I can vouche for are the bartenders... but they're good... so
Janell C.,Henderson  NV,0,21,,8/19/2012,3.0,We go to BJ's about every 6 weeks  and I like the atmosphere and the food  but the service on every occasion I have eaten there is awful ! Why can't they get some decent servers? It almost ruins a nice dinner.  Also it would be nice if the salads  and appetizers came out well before the main couirse food  however they either forget them altogether  or you are in the middle of eating your salad when your hot food shows up. They can't get it right  it seems. Even the manager can't seem to help the situation.
John O.,Las Vegas  NV,4,2,,5/14/2011,5.0,Great beer  menu has something for everyone  and prices are reasonable. What not to like. Had the grilled pork chops -- but prepared like the new low calorie dish. These were excellent. Great spicy sauce. Red potatoes were good too. Abbey Normal season beer was great.
William C.,Brooklyn  NY,932,826,77,9/24/2008,3.0,Not much to say. Very typical type of spot. Nice look and feel. Decent food. Didnt blow me away  but maybe that is because I didnt try their famous pizza. I'll update the next time I am out there  but that is only if I actually feel like going back. I recommend it more as a spot to fit a bunch of friends who want to grab some cold ones and some grub while watching the games.
Jake M.,North Las Vegas  NV,68,5,1,9/20/2011,5.0,This is a great place to dine on your lunch break from work or happy hour.Great food and a casual atmosphere.Mostly everything on there menu is a A+.I eat here for lunch at least three times a week.Pretty Crowded around noon hours.
Alan H.,Las Vegas  NV,1,16,,6/30/2013,5.0,Great food and friendly service. No wait for a table in the bar area. Ice cold beer selection too. Thanks. The giant stuffed potato was great.
Mike H.,Juneau  AK,13,17,,6/26/2011,2.0,PROS:+Excellent Service+Pizookie ('nuff said)+Large entreesCONS:-The beer was lack luster and forgettable. If a dessert outshines the beer at a brewery  something is amiss.-This pub is a local favorite so it gets very crowded and noisy around happy hour.BOTTOM LINEGo there for an appetizer and then the Pizookie. If it is your first time  get the mini trio. Do not try to get an entree and then the Pizzokie or you'll be sorry. My wife and I enjoy microbreweries and independents but decided to try this chain (107 restaurants as of June 2011). It was a good dessert experience  but we probably wouldn't go there again.
Justin W.,Las Vegas  NV,8,55,1,4/18/2010,5.0,My girlfriend and I went here just last night  and it was amazing like always. Their pizza is one of the best I have ever had. They have all of the traditional toppings  but their specialty pizzas are to die for. I had a buffalo chicken pizza that was spot on and amazing. Their always seems to be a long wait (and for good reason)  so make sure to call ahead. Also  their desert 'Pizookie'  which is a cookie topped with ice cream cooked in a small pizza pan  is a perfect end to a meal.
Ronnie R.,Lakewood  CA,28,17,3,8/18/2010,4.0,Love the food and the beer what more is there to say. Oh yea  the pizza is real good but kinda pricey if you get a lot of toppings.
Krystal P.,Las Vegas  NV,1,31,3,4/2/2011,5.0,Quickly climbing the charts as my favorite place to eat in town is BJ's! Their menu is incredible  their beer and wine list is excellent  and their service is great! Hubby got a huge burger that he quickly devoured. I ordered the Alfredo pizza (made from scratch) and it was the best pizza I've ever had! The kids got the mac and cheese and devoured it of course! To top off the dinner we had the chocolate chip pizzone  which was to die for! Be sure to call ahead and put your name on the list as this place is always packed  and for good reason! Run  don't walk  to this place.
Akinyele O.,Salt Lake City  UT,6,22,1,7/12/2010,3.0,Tasty food and the beer choices are solid. I really enjoyed their house pale ale paired with a tasty  but not spectacular  vegetarian pizza. This is good place to go with a group  keep in mind that it is impossible to get a table on a Friday night. I find this place on the spendy side. However  the lunch and happy hour specials are a good deal  so try it hit those if you're a miserly cheapskate like me. Tenaya Creek offers better beers  Big Dogs boasts more enticing food options; BJ's is a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood. Minus a point because it is  and feels like  a corporate chain.
Mimi R.,Tampa  FL,2,80,162,6/19/2010,5.0,Excellent food  great customer seervice  nice selection of beer. This place is always consistent. They always greet you with smiles at the door. The food is delicious. I like their pizzas and burgers. The menu has something for everyone- sandwiches  meatloaf  chicken  lettuce wraps  ribs  fish  etc. Everything comes in large portions too. You must save room for dessert! Try a pizookie! It's a fresh baked cookie with ice cream. They come in different flavors-chocolate chip  cookies n cream  oatmeal  chocolate  and white chocolate macadamia. For drinks  try a snake bite (guiness+pear cider)  berry burst cider  or any of their own brews. Their root beear and cream sodas are really tasty too. You won't be disappointed. Its a great place to have dinner with a group of friends. This place is in the strip mall across the street from Red Rock casino/hotel.
Jean Y.,Las Vegas  NV,0,16,,2/7/2013,4.0,Excellent food  extremely broad menu selection  fast service  limited parking  very reasonable prices. Accepts call ahead reservations.
T B.,Las Vegas  NV,0,89,,10/30/2012,1.0,We go often and the last time it was really bad. Pizza had no to very little sause and the crust was doughy. They also changed the crust. There are better places around. Staff is nice  but not worth the risk of another bad meal. We will not be going back.
Darroe G.,Las Vegas  NV,4,20,,7/20/2008,4.0,Great atmosphere  great service. There are many menu items to choose from. Plus Pizookies are awesome! You get a free one for your birthday ;)
Michael H.,Pittsburg  CA,42,271,7,1/22/2010,3.0,Every time I have come here I always get the avocado appetizer and it fills me up so I have yet to try anything else. My wife usually orders a salad  but the beer is what we go here for. While we're not always in the mood for beer  there are only two places in all of Vegas I'd recommend  the first is Chicago's  but this is a close second. Ok  I guess a third would be Gordon Biersch  but whatever.
Liana L.,Brooklyn  NY,283,321,26,2/9/2009,3.0,This place was OK. My boyfriend raved about it because he is a beer lovin' maniac but I did not have the same strong feelings about it. We went here for dinner one night but I'd say you'd be better off going here to watch some sports and have a good beer. I don't think I'd come back here if I had a choice in the matter.
Julie W.,Las Vegas  NV,54,212,17,2/26/2012,4.0,Food totally rocks! We have eatten here  as well as  have done carry out. It's almost always crowded on the weekend  but the wait is manageable. The waitstaff is friendly and always able to give great recommendations! Wonderful Fish Tacos! Great portion size too...so you will not leave hungry.
aref H.,Las Vegas  NV,1,2,,12/7/2010,4.0,The deep dish pizza.  good ambience. excellent service. are all worth the visit.  we are never disappointed.
J C.,Las Vegas  NV,67,223,12,9/27/2009,4.0,I went there for brunch on a sat. It was pretty crowded but we were seated right away and service was good. I had a hef which didn't come w/ a lemon wedge but it was lemony without it. I also had their stout which was nitrogenated but still wasn't creamy like a cask Guiness. I had the breakfast pizza and it came with home fries. The food was pretty good not the best but reasonably priced.
Ryan G.,Las Vegas  NV,161,63,7,7/20/2011,4.0,they make their own cream soda. now how can you not like a place that makes their own soda. every time i go here its a blast. the only food i have had is the pizzas and so far there is not one i dislike. i really like hanging out relaxing and watching the sports on the tvs with good friends here.
Robert M.,Mableton  GA,6,5,,11/20/2011,5.0,I have gone here twice and each time excellent service and food. If you can put your diet on hold go and enjoy BJ's.
Tom J.,Las Vegas  NV,0,53,,11/16/2009,4.0,I have eaten here several times. Have enjoyed the white pizza. I usually order it with extra garlic. The pizza dough is fantastic. I have tried the mozzeralla sticks and the avacado egg rolls. Both were not that great. And I agree with the other posters that the Pizookie should not be missed.My only quibbles are that the prices are a little high and it is way too crowded and noisy.
Valerie V.,Las Vegas  NV,0,5,1,8/21/2011,4.0,after hearing alot about this place & reading tons of reviews. we finally checked this place out. me  my hubby & our 3 month old went here for my birthday. they are kid/baby friendly(one of my worries because i thought since it had a bar that it wouldnt be smoke-free but it was) they provided a sling for our son's carseat which was very convinient not having to bring the stroller inside. i love the ambiance and feel of the place. we were given a table as soon as we got there. our server was soo awesome he was very warm and he really knows what he is talkin about especially when about the menu.(so we gave him a fat tip) they have a wide variety of food on the menu. so we got chips and salsa 5.95 more than enough. i also got the SEARED AHI very small portion 3.95. my hubby got the grilled PORKCHOPS which was really good 14.95 and i got the JAMBALAYA! omg to die for!! for 15.95 worth it. soooo addicting! good sized portions which gave us leftovers. aaand since it was my birthday a complimentary PIZOOKIE :] soo bomb! they also have a wide variety of beer.. if you guys love beer. we do lol so overall yes we would def keep comin back here.. all i can think about is the jambalaya as im writing this lol
Hapi A.,Las Vegas  NV,7,6,,6/6/2008,4.0,Move over Pizza Hut! BJ's has you pinned for their pan pizza! If you like Pizza Hut and like their Pan Pizzas then you'll definitely love BJ's Favorite Pizza! Their pizza in my opinion tastes better! mmmmmm! It's a pan pizza with all the fixin's Oven-baked meatballs  pepperoni  Italian sausage  mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions and fresh Roma tomatoes. This pizza is so yummy! It's nice they have different sizes you can order...mini size  small  medium & large of coarse. This way it suites your hunger and how many will be eating it! I like it cuz sometimes I just want a taste and I can order the mini! ... I also like their chicken wings too! Luv it! gotta try it!
Sara S.,Las Vegas  NV,58,76,7,5/11/2010,4.0,Despite the fact that they are a national chain  BJs actually has really great pizza. They have a large beer selection  including a sampler and different seasonal brews. They have a large menu with the usual apps (wings  southwest eggrolls)  pastas  burgers  salads  and pizza. My husband and I come here for their deep dish pizza- the crust is buttery and cooked to perfection. Their traditional cheese is delicious and topped with chunks of tomatoes  and they have great specialty pizzas like bbq chicken or spinach and artichoke. Dessert here is also the bomb- deep dish baked to order cookies called pizookies  available in different flavors and topped with ice cream (my fav is the oreo).
Amy P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,16,,4/7/2011,5.0,Everything I've eaten here is delicious. Good service. Excellent pizza and pizookies. It's our go-to restaurant. Menu is ridiculously large.
kawehi m.,Las Vegas  NV,4,9,,9/23/2010,5.0,Haven't been to BJ's in a while and we went last night for the Pary for Two special they have for Sept. My first time for pizza  the BJ Combo was excellent  couldnt finish it. I usually have Jeremiah Red but decided to try the Oktoberfest last night  Loved It! And after the Pizookie  yummy i wanted to sleep.  I love the food  service and atmosphere at BJ's especially the BEER.
Nader A.,Nome  AK,382,105,62,4/29/2007,5.0,I only tried one of the beers  their porter. It was decent  but it did not really stand out. The salad I ordered on the other hand was very good. It had candied pecans and a variety of greens. The wait staff was also excellent. Attentive  but you hardly noticed they were there.
forty n.,Las Vegas  NV,0,4,,1/26/2009,5.0,daryl was the best server i have ever had! he deserves a nice tip every visit
