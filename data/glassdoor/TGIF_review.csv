Friday's,<br><br>Where individuals are trusted to do their very best every day regardless of their competence. On the surface, this may seem like recipe for disaster, but Friday's has a secret ingredient to bake the perfect success pie every time. Everyone is given the tools to succeed and trained extensively to use them with perfect form. Once an individual has the epiphany that serving is as simple as following a few steps and smiling, dropping the need to overcomplicate things and get to it, they will be successful with very little micromanagement. Adding to the total amount of tables one can serve at a time only when ready, and taking them back without a lecture or any voiced disappointment keeps servers motivated to maintain tables, but doesn't give a feeling of failure or rip the will to succeed from those who may be struggling o navigate through a rough patch.<br><br>The endless metrics and numbers seem complicated (PPA, Table Turn Time, Customer Surveys, Liquor sale percentage, etc) but the reality is simple. Follow the Friday's Style and you watch your stats go up. It becomes clear early on that posting the numbers in real time isn't a reason to discipline employees, but a motivator. I big bulletin board of how hard everyone is working.<br><br> I had no idea how great T.G.I. Friday's is until I had my second job serving. I was astonished by the lack of professionalism and tools for success in most other restaurants. I will always regret leaving for the reasons I did and be grateful for the confidence Friday's awarded me, and the skills I was taught.<br><br>To conclude, here's a list of what Friday's offers, and what I will take with me always I as grow into a young manager of my own.<br><br>-The training program has detailed, easy steps to create a structured interaction with the customer. This helps servers gain confidence and know exactly what they should be doing, and when to do it so they can get the best tip possible. If you follow the service style from the training program you WILL have happy customers.<br><br>-The management is endlessly patient. It took me almost a month to learn the menu and be ready to take my own tables, but management kept pushing me to succeed and continued to give me the tools to succeed where others would have let me burn out.<br><br>-Continued education into better departments helped many people as I was serving. I saw my peers move from serving to bartending with the same structure and tools that helped me learn to serve. They were not ""promoted"" until they had proven they were ready, and then they were given the utmost confidence and patience as they moved to their new position seamlessly. I saw hosts become servers, and dishwashers become hosts. Everyone had an opportunity to improve and they were trusted to be successful when it happened.<br><br>-Friday's is true to itself. It doesn't have white table cloths or formal hosts. The menu doesn't give gimmicky names and copy cat recipes. It's not uncommon for fast casual chains to try to appeal to the market by appearing higher class or overly family friendly to mask the fact that they're just a name on a long list of nearly identical restaurants that a guest could choose. Conversely, Friday's embraces its normality by playing the role of ""corner bar"" where guests are greeted by what I called the ""Hey how are ya"" attitude.","The restaurant's constant desire to improve was endearing, unfortunately with risk often comes failure. For example, the menu took a complete overhaul with little warning, and that created a gap where servers had been trained so strictly to work with a specific menu that no longer existed.<br><br>On the same subject, that constant push for improvement had many of the high performing employees feeling unrewarded. As some individuals put in the effort and surpassed their peers with the motivation of ""winning"" and shining to the top as performer, it would be seen by management as a reason to push the individuals harder and set a standard for the other employees who may be putting their best into another metric, or struggling to keep up.<br><br>Although, I'm sure this varies from location to location, the restaurant I had the pleasure of serving in struggling with a major communication issue. It would not be uncommon for the kitchen to be on an entirely different page than the servers or the bartenders to be lost in a crowd and have food run incorrectly. I do believe management meant well, and that this problem would be solved easily if it was addressed.","Although I am immensely underqualified to give advice to any company so large, I can give an idea of my observations so you (the reader) can decide of these culture shortcomings are something you are willing to deal with, or if applying for the right position, tackle. As a business owner myself now, in an entirely different industry, here are my thoughts.<br><br>-Never has a coupon cutting, freebie grabbing customer been a customer I would want to encourage. Friday's uses many cost-cutting tactics to get people in the door. A great example is the Unlimited Apps program. You are not encouraging customers to come in and have a few drinks to make up for the savings in food. You are encouraging a crowd that drinks water and skips dessert to come in because they want cheap. They rarely return for anything else. Another is the rewards program. It's feels tailored to cheap customers who don't see in value, but instead, see in price. They don't care if the food or service is good, only that it's cheap and they tend to complain more than others, taking up vital resources. Reward programs are a great way to gain customers, but the current system is, in my opinion, implemented poorly.<br><br>-Again, I feel that communication could be improved on in all aspects of the business such as policy changes, scheduling, and customer feedback. The employees observed all these things but didn't have an avenue to make or request a change. Giving staff an outlet to voice suggestion and have them be heard and appreciated would improve lots of the problems that exist, but management will never hear about because low-level employees are not encouraged to speak up, living by an attitude best described as ""That's just the way it is"", despite the overall culture being very forward driven and unafraid of change."

You don't need any prior experience to start working here like in many restaurants. The interview was easy and they will hire you if they are in need of what ever position you are applying for. The managers change and many of them are reasonable if you just do your job and others are very laid back. As for the employees almost every one is welcoming and fun to be around.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is outgoing which was one of my favorite parts about working here. They are very flexible with your time shifts.,"The first down side to this location is the customers that come in. Many of them are ghetto and complain just to get free items and don't know how to tip. They don't train the employees well espicially those up at the front such as the hosts, therefore that's why it's important to ask questions and to remember them during your training days. They give the servers way too much side work it can take 40 min to 100 min to complete them. You do get faster the longer you work here. All servers have to roll two baskets of silverware, sweep and wipe your own tables(they usually only have bussers on weekends), and do one more task that varies every day.

Tips share is given out in cash and can be picked up the next morning. Direct deposit every two weeks. Unlimited soft drinks like water, coca cola, sprite, lemonade. Discount is 50% off food while working. If its a slow day, work load is not too bad; especially if you are host lead.","Tip share could sometimes be rather low on slow days or on days that they have too many hosts on at once. Do not make plans on nights you are working on weekends! Rarely or never gets out on time; especially if closing. I get cut between 1:30 and 2am when closing. Even when not closing, I usually get out an hour later from my scheduled time. However, if you want hours and don't care about social life on weekends then I guess this wouldn't be considered a con for you. Closing shifts are very long and could be annoying when the restaurant is slow, becuase no matter how slow or busy the restaurant is, you still have to be there till the kitchen closes at 1am, because you are the closer. If you were second to last to come before the closer and the closer or another host decides not to show up, the management will expect you to stay longer or close and stay till the end. Work shifts are very unpredictable (that is why you should never make plans weekend nights you work or tell management that you have plans beforehand). The management expects you to constantly be moving and you usually wind up doing more work than what your job description expects from you. Work load is a lot when restaurant is busy. Especially if you are bussing that night. Management is really bad at communicating when certain closers are cut and changes of resaurant for that day.<br>Moving up from host to server is not too promising at some TGI Friday's locations. At my location, the management hired 5 new servers from outside the company and have not moved up a single host. Furthermore, the only way the host next in line to be server will be moved up, is if they hire 8-10 more hosts and train them to a certain level of experience. Chances of that happening is low, because the restaurants needs enough hosts to replace the host moving up and new hosts usually do not last and quit after 2 weeks of working or current hosts get fed up and lose hope of getting moved up and eventually quit anyway.","Work on getting employees out on there scheduled time. Have closers start closing duties within a time frame that will get them out by a decent hour. Taking the subway at 2am and getting home at 3am suck when you are closing.<br>When you cut servers, tell the host leads so that they don't keep sitting that section and let them know which server is taking over that section. Let Host lead know when a section of the restaurant is cut off. Let the lead host know if you are deciding to close the kitchen earlier than usual so that the host can give calling customers proper time information. Basically just let us know when changes are made on the floor or for the restaurant throughout the shift. Keep us informed. Appreciate the extra work you ask us to do, don't expect it. Don't expect hosts to close that were not supposed to close and show appreciation if they do. Stop cutting closers by accident or if they pick up a double shift. (closers should not be approved to pick up a morning shift, if they are not planning to still close out the restaurant that night). Work on hiring more hosts and moving up current hosts to server; instead of hiring more servers from outside the company."

At the time I resigned (proper two-weeks' notice and all, of course), I was getting paid $1.50 above the starting pay rate for hosts. It took me over a year and a half to get my first raise, even though I was told by various people (including managers!) many times prior that I deserved an increase in pay.","Lots of favoritism going on, both on the manager-employee level and at a higher level (district manager to various store managers, including kitchen, service, and bar managers as well as general managers).<br>Very little incentive to work there for long.<br>Standards are not enforced company-wide, even in the same region/district.<br>A lot of hourly employees only get certain opportunities/privileges because they cry/whine/beg. I've seen coworkers who LITERALLY throw a FIT because something didn't go their way... and get rewarded for acting like a four-year-old. And then there are those who are even given a pay raise just because they threatened to walk out (quit). Such a childish environment sometimes--you'll probably do better in this company if you act like a toddler.","Check in on your stores. At some locations, I *guarantee* you can ask any employee hired in the last 2-3 years: ""What does NNBS stand for?"" and she will have no clue. Or, ""Explain the four stages of Fridays Service Style,"" and he'll just give you a blank stare. Even something as simple as, ""What does the longboat in your store represent?"" and you'll get an answer of, ""What? What longboat?!"" There's great training available, BUT ONLY if you're looking in a location that really honors the ""old"" values. I was hired at one location where the manager started my training off with an absolutely fantastic orientation session, and I had basically the same two ""coaches"" (trainers) who WORKED TOGETHER to make my training period (5 days) not only informative and effective, but also enjoyable! After a while, I transferred to another location in search of better opportunity. They had a new kid train me, even though I'd been working at a much higher volume location for over a year. I mean, he was a nice guy--and pretty competent, too! But he was also inexperienced and somewhat naive about the business. Pretty soon, I became the main ""coach"" because of my level of experience and my variety of jobs within the company. (I also worked as a server, busser, and food runner... even some dishwasher shifts!) When I trained new employees, I made sure they really understood the concepts I was taught at my old store, because that was how the company *wanted* everyone trained... it's just that the store to which I transferred places almost no importance on good training. It's just a negative cycle, and that's a major reason why things have gone so far downhill since I was originally hired in 2013.<br><br>The other reason? It's huge. Ya' ready? Okay, here goes... STOP ROLLING OUT THOSE COST-RAISING, MORALE-LOWERING, IMPLICITLY-TIP-EXEMPTING, CHEAP-CLIENTELE-ATTRACTING PROMOS!!!!! When you big wigs come up those GENIUS (i.e. really crappy) schemes like ""Endless Apps"" (or worse, ""Endless CHOICE"") and ""Jump Burger"" and ""2 for $10"" and ""Rib Flight Trio"" and anything else that advertises free food or substantially lowered prices of the same menu items that our Guests should, and otherwise WOULD, be buying at full price, you bring in a different breed who are no longer deserving of the designation ""Guest,"" or even ""Customer."" ...People who don't tip, blatantly disregarding the basic societal rule that they should tip the server AT LEAST 18-20 percent of their pre-comp, pre-tax bill because the server provided BEYOND SPECTACULAR service. ...People who get up and LEAVE the establishment AFTER being seated and ordering beverages, just because the answer to ""Are y'all still doin' that 2 for $20 deal?"" was not the ""Yes"" they were looking to get. (Mind you, the ""2 for $20"" was something that Chili's does... NOT Fridays. And the Fridays' equivalent, the ""2 for $10""? It ended for the last time about 2 years ago. So no, we do not have ""that 2 for $20 deal""!!) ...And people who get ticked off when their check is listed out exactly how the server told them it would be BEFORE the order was entered. Oh, but they were too busy gabbing with the other dozen people in their party and just ""couldn't hear"" the rule about the charge for Endless Apps being PER PERSON. Well, I'm (not) sorry, but DUH! you can't feed 13 people with as much as they can eat and expect the bill to only come up to $10! P.S. There's a $2 upcharge when you switch out the appetizers. Yeah, your server told you that at the beginning, too.<br><br>Last little tip I'm going to put out there: Make working at Fridays more EXCITING (or at least satisfying!) by providing better benefits. For example, make the Black Card available at EVERY location, not just some. I worked with TGI Fridays for just under the 3 years required to get a Red Card (I was 22 days short, to be exact), and I kid you not... $4 off a meal that normally costs $19-something is NOT a benefit that makes me positively thrilled to work at Fridays. I never got a Black Card. I only learned about it from the bartender at another Fridays while on vacation in the Midwest. Nor did I get a Red Card. Like I said, 22 days longer, and I'd have gotten it... maybe. Like, if I bugged my manager about it enough so he'd order the card just to get me off his back. Regardless, I did not feel like the time I spent working there was valued... because there was no incentive to keep going. Stripes Members get more out of Fridays than employees do! Heck, Guests who COMPLAIN (even a smidge) get far more than we do... So my advice to upper management? Make it a SPECIAL experience to work at Fridays. Not just standard. And definitely not sub-par.<br><br>I'm not bitter about my experiences with Fridays, and I do realize that these things could happen in ANY restaurant. But I am relieved and consider myself very fortunate to be establishing a new career path, and I mourn for those who still work with this company and are ""stuck""--because that does happen, too. Please consider improving the employee experience by taking the above notes into serious consideration. Thank you."

With that being said, overall my experience with the company has been positive. The money you make is drastically different from store to store, and bar tending at Friday's isn't easy. While a server has 4 tables to manage, we have to keep up with the entire bar top, the 4 bar booths and 5 high top tables, as well as stay on top of service bar(make drinks for every server) and also help with taking to-go orders. When it's busy it can be a lot of work but in my experience I have been happy there bc I've liked most of my managers, especially my bar managers, and have also made some great friends that I work with daily. Fridays def has its flaws and can be frustrating but overall I do like working for this company.","As I said before bar tending at Friday's can be a lot of work and sometimes, and it's not uncommon to be underpaid....depending on where your store is located and what kind of clientele you have. Some nights you might run for 8 hours straight and end up making 50 bucks bc of the tip poop...other nights you could do the same work and make 120. The only negative things I really have to say are that it is inconsistent often, and you can get burnt out closing the bar 4 nights a weeks, working from 4-130.","Instead of trying to look for and find things were doing wrong, look at the amount of work some of us are actually doing and compliment your employees who are working hard and doing a good job. Instead of focusing so much on the accuracy of inventory, notice the efforts of your employees, give compliments when they are due, just as you give criticism when it's due, also try to keep them from getting burnt out.,"

The veteran servers run the show and get off from barking out side work commands throughout the shift, which is actually the most passive aggressive and ineffective approach to getting running side work done. Newer servers that get cut first, get the most side work, the select closing servers give themselves minimal to no side work, and instead of putting in an effort to help out with the work that needs to be done throughout a shift, they shout out their commands. Instead of the management implementing a more effective running side work model, this approach is the accepted way to run things.<br><br>During the interviews, the management suggests they cut based on performance, not seniority. With the absence of the management in the front of the house to observe newer servers performing well, the same servers always stay the latest, in the best sections of the restaurant, which leaves little money to be made for the newer crew. Upper management in the company are always riding restaurant management to get hours down, so most of the time, even on a busy Saturday, a shift doesn't last longer than three hours on the floor.<br><br>During the interview and training process, the management and training servers imply that you will be applauded for your hard work, staying on top of running side work, rolling silverware throughout your shift, and will be rewarded for doing so. There is no acknowledgement for working hard, and clearly no benefits either, the same servers will continue to run the show and stay in the money making sections of the restaurant.<br><br>I will note that so much work is left to the servers and it's tough for the restaurant management to involve themselves with the front of the house more because the company doesn't want to spend the money on an expediter, and bussers and runners. Besides the weekends, servers and management fill the shoes of an expediter, and servers also run and bus their tables, and always run other table's plates as well. If the management could focus on being management, and not expediters, things might run more fairly for the front of the house staff. If the servers had a food runner, they could manage more of the running side work.","To restaurant management - consider involving yourself more in the FOH.

We have a new daily, weekly, monthly contest every few days and it's almost impossible to keep track of what contest they're focusing most on, especially when there are 4 contests being run all at once. They are very forceful about having a high PPA, upselling, alcohol sales, and guest surveys, to the point of we are threatened to be demoted to host if we don't sell enough alcohol, have a high PPA, and consistently receive good survey results. And it is stupid how anything that is considered ""positive"" on the survey is 9 or 10. We're consistently written up for receiving an 8 or 7 on a survey, even when the guest believes that is a good rating and has nothing but good to say about us. The list of ""non-negotiable brand standards"" that we are required to perform at each table absolutely ridiculous, almost impossible to execute, and annoying to the guests! It takes about 3 minutes to ""properly"" greet our tables and another 5 minutes total throughout the rest of the dining experience to upsell, ask a million questions, and upsell even more. The managers do not communicate with one another and each one cares about something different, and most of them do not agree on how to handle coupons, guest complaints, upcharging, etc. The cooks generally do not care about their jobs, and each cook makes each dish differently, so the guest never gets consistent food quality, recipe, ingredients, and especially portion sizes. Same goes with bar drinks, every bartender makes every drink differently and the guests never know what to expect. Management does not pay attention to who works on which holidays, so the good workers usually end up working every holiday while others get almost every single one off.

TGI Friday's really value their culture and background of how they became to be who they are now and are really passionate about educating their employees onto the reasoning behind why they do things.","Unreliable hours - Some weeks I was given 25 (which was my contracted hours) and other weeks I was given 4 for the whole week which was ultimately one of the main reasons why I left.<br><br>Managers tend to have favourites who they offer the better hours too. If you book a day off which they didn't really want you to have, they will screw you over in return.<br><br>Staff are out to help themselves and will trip you up if it means making them looking better. It was horrible to watch on my trial shift and then to continue to witness during my employment.<br><br>The relationship between the Kitchen staff and the front of house team was not friendly. Sauces being thrown through the window, food purposely being left to the back of the cooking queue to make a specific waiter/waitress look bad.","Managers shouldn't hide away in the office when we are busy as you were all in our position at one point, running the floor when you were severely understaffed.<br><br>Don't allow people to take days off if it means there won't be enough people working that shift which ultimately adds an unrealistic strain to those who are working.<br><br>More extensive training is needed before staff are left on their own. More shadowing shifts would be beneficial.<br><br>Its frustrating to see so many problems within the company as before I was hired I was a big T.G.I Friday's fan and visited regularly, but since working there for nearly 12 months I can safely say I will never dine there again knowing how badly treated the staff are."
