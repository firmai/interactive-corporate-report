54,Stephanie W.,"Rockwood, MI",6,17,13.0,3.0,2012-01-16,"I have been going to this Red Robin location for at least 10 years. Up until recently I had always enjoyed dining here. That's why I'm still debating between 2 and 3 stars. Several of my most recent visits were sub-par, with the most recent being the worst of all. Most recently, I went with 2 friends, one of which had a 7 month old at the time. In the past, the service I've received at this restaurant has always been decent, if at times maybe a tiny on the slow side. However, I had never actually been upset by the service until this particular night. The service was absurd. We actually debated not tipping, but we felt bad and still left a few dollars each...although she didn't deserve even 10%. Once we had placed our orders and gotten our soups, our food took forever to come out, and in the meantime the waitress did not come back to check on us. When our food finally did come out, another employee brought it out and we were in serious need of refills. I ordered the French onion soup and fish sandwich that comes with coleslaw on it, and the ""coleslaw"" had no dressing whatsoever- it was just dry shredded cabbage. The fish itself was cold. However the French onion soup was really good. By the time the waitress finally came back to check on us, I just wanted my sandwich sent back and another bowl of soup. My friend had also gotten a soup and sandwich and when the waitress came back with my new soup, she asked for a box for half of her sandwich. She came back with a box and the bill, which we had to have separated and my sandwich removed from still. In the meantime, the 7 month old baby had become fussy and my friend was tending to her. Once the waitress returned with our corrected checks, she took my friend's half sandwich she had gotten the box for but was too busy taking care of her daughter to put into the box just yet. My friend's sister mentioned this to the waitress and she apologized and said she'd have the kitchen make her a new one, so we waited. After about 15 to 20 minutes of waiting to get the sandwich so we could leave, we saw the waitress standing near the doors of the restaurant, talking to someone who looked like it could be her mom, and also using her cell phone. We decided to leave at that point, because we had gotten fed up with waiting and being ignored. We stopped in to grab some quick soup and sandwiches and ended up being there for nearly 2 hours because the service was so slow. The food was incredibly underwhelming, aside from the soup. All in all, I'm sure I'll be back to Red Robin in the future, but I will definitely be wary the next time I'm there. If the service and food continues in this fashion, I won't remain a repeat customer much longer. I also feel it's worth noting that the menu seems to have downsized quite a bit and a few of the items are doubled, such as burgers you can also get as wraps. They seem to be missing a few items that I rather miss. I hope this restaurant isn't really going downhill, as I did always enjoy it. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

53,Dawn W.,"Levelland, TX",67,52,1.0,2.0,2012-09-10,"Normally a chain restaurant gets three stars from me minimum because of the corporate standards regarding service and such, but Red Robin in Southgate is only getting two.   My husband and I always look for interesting places to dine, and will always give a chain restaurant a chance to impress us.  After all, they didn't become a chain for no reason, right? Well, the four times we have dined here were four lessons in various levels of disappointment.   Three times it was the agonizingly slow service--and normally, we never go to a restaurant during any dinner or lunch rush.  With a less than half-full dining room, why does it take almost ten minutes for anyone to come over and inquire about drinks?   There are televisions randomly scattered throughout the dining room, and the noise level is rather high, but this is normal for a family restaurant.  The menu has many choices for those with varying levels of burger tolerance.  The restaurant features bottomless steak fries with most of the burgers.  The dessert menu has several interesting and unusual offerings, and features milkshakes.   Most of the menu items are a bit on the pricey side for a family chain restaurant, and normally for the two of us it is around $30 when all is said and done.  It is not difficult to find a better choice in the area, unless someone in your family really digs the kitschy decor and doesn't mind being seated around large families.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004

Service was incrediably slow and it wasn't due to the fact of them being busy. However I did try their Coor's Lite beer cocktail which was very tasty. Perfect summer drink IMO. As for the food it was just meh. For the 3 of us to eat it was over $45 which in my book is too damn much a freaking burger. I won't be venturing back anytime soon.

If you're not a big fan of hamburgers or if you can grill a good burger at home, Red Robin might not be for you.  I've never had anything messed up, and my order has always been delivered rather quickly by servers who are usually good at their job.  The food has always been good. I don't know what it is about Red Robin though, but it seems like a dine-in restaurant that parents always bring their kids to eat.  I hate dining next to a table of kids, but it always seems to be that way at Red Robin.  Last time, there must've been a birthday party or something, and the huge group had a bunch of kids being more rambunctious and uncontrollable than a dog pissing on the carpet in excitement because company is over.  If it's busy, it will always be loud in there.  Because of the design of their parking lot, you will not get a good parking spot at all if they are busy.  You might as well start walking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=20,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

There were some bigger parties including my party of 8.  I will always return. I love Red Robin!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
35,Steve C.,"Dearborn, MI",0,7,,2.0,2016-10-01,"2 stars. 1 for the food ( pretty good) and 1 for the service. Bill the server did a great job. But that's where the good marks end. This restaurant is a filthy mess. We sat at the bar and it smelled like stale beer, the counter had ketchup smeared on it. The bar tender ignored it and didn't bother to wipe it down when we sat down. Once we were seated, my wife got up to use the ladies room which was in need of a serious cleaning. On her return, she slipped on "" something"" that had spilled on the stairs. She fell completely down. I gave the manager the feedback and he didn't seem to care, his answer for the filth was to blame the hostess... Not good leadership.

Today we went back and had Alyssa (apologies if that's the incorrect spelling). She was great. From the get-go she was attentive and helpful. She was quick with everything, repeated our orders for confirmation (and did it again as she sat them down at the table). We never wanted for anything. She took great care of my family, our special orders, and repeated fry requests.  Once again, the greeter was fantastic.

Look at the way my burger and fries are served.  Very sad looking, Not appetizing to Look at or taste. This is not the kids meal. Skimpy amount of fries and the Smokey peper jack burger is about the size of McDonalds regular hamburger- not like pictured in menu.   Service is So slow. Good luck trying to get a drink or fry refil. What good is bottomless fries when you can't get any. I blame the management because we were recently at the Red Robin down the street from U of M Ann Arbor and what a night and day difference. Very good there even with a full house.

Whatever kind of burger you're craving, they have it. The appetizers are pretty good as well....we normally get the pretzel bites.  We went here last Saturday and got seated near the bar at a 2 person table. The host that brought us to our table was friendly... our waiter, not so much(didn't catch his name). I think that maybe he was a bartender and got pulled to wait tables by the bar or something, I couldn't really tell. If his job is truly a server, I would be shocked. It's not that he was rude, but he just wasn't friendly at all. He didn't greet us, all he said was ""what can I get you?"" He didn't ask if we wanted drinks or offer us any specials they had...he didn't ask if we wanted to start with an appetizer. Just a plain old ""what can I get you?""  So we ordered waters and an appetizer. I also ordered a milkshake but told him he could wait to bring it out with the food. He brought out our waters and then a different waiter brought us our appetizer. Our waiter didn't bring out any silverware or napkins so we had to ask a different waitress for some. Then, he came back and took our food orders. The food took about 15 minutes to come out and was brought by ANOTHER waiter. He looked around for our waiter and asked if we needed anything... we told him just some more water so he went and got it for us because our waiter wasn't around.  Our waiter didn't come back to our table, until we were almost finished with our meal, and said ""what kind of milkshake do you want?"" I just told him I changed my mind.  He NEVER returned to our table until he gave us our bill. He did however walk around taking other customers' orders and talking out loud to another girl working saying that he's ""ready to leave and go to the bar and he's not staying late tonight."" I would MAYBE expect this type of talk from a kid in his 20's but this was a grown man.  Just not impressed with the service that night. I've never had any other problems here before...we normally always have great service but this just left a bad taste in my mouth. I would give the food and other employees that helped 5 stars but this guy in particular I'd give 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

3,Jon F.,"Lincoln Park, MI",3,74,14.0,3.0,2017-08-07,"Red Robin, like so many chains, is one of those places that can be a reliable outing for you, but it can also be hit and miss.  When I traveled more and was in a hurry, I would rely on places like Chili's and RR to get me taken care of and still enjoy the meal.  From time to time I could be let down (Applebee's just down the street on Eureka, I'm looking at you!), but for the most part, you can do okay with these places.  Red Robin in Southgate is just that. We went this last weekend on Sunday afternoon.  This is Church crowd time, so the places on Eureka Rd will be busy but you shouldn't have any problems getting in.  We sat at the bar as always, and our bartender did a fine job, not too nosy and not 'disappeared'.  We split the Big Sirracha burger and an order of garlic Parmesan fries.  My girlfriend had a rum & coke and I had a pint of the Two-Hearted. The drinks were okay, my beer was cold enough but my girlfriend felt that her rum & coke was flat.  The burger was good.  I don't know that I'd call these world class, but they use good ingredients and everything tasted like a good burger should - you can taste the meat but also the sauce and everything else.  The fries were okay.  I liked the Parmesan garlic topping, and they were fries, but I just have never been impressed with their steak fries.  I would like them to be crispier but I don't know that that will happen.  The only other complaint I had was that it was too warm and muggy.  RR, put on the AC and get that temp to room 72! So, overall I wasn't blown away but I'd be totally okay with it if it was on the agenda.  A couple of changes and I'd be much more impressed, as I was when I first went to RR back in Cali.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
