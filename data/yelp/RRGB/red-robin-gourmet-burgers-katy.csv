Melissa G.,"Katy, TX",104,646,82,4.0,11/3/2017,"Still not great, but better than I remembered from my visits 4+ years ago.  The wait staff is still pretty good.  I think they are trying a bit more with the burgers and the toppings as well.  The burgers are messy, but it is a juiciness now more than just grease.  Then there are the fries while you wait. In my previous review I said their chicken sandwiches were great, but I have to take that back after my last visit.  A portion of it had a consistency like it wasn't fully cooked.  I didn't eat all of it, but I was still nauseated the rest of the night.   One of the new things is a small computer at the table with games and news.  You can play trivia games and such for $3 using this device.  We all carry miniature computers with us stocked with free games and they want us to pay them?  Seriously?  Just not sure what they are thinking with that.  That and it's greasy from all the previous customers - eww.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Heather S.,"Houston, TX",6,111,49,2.0,10/7/2017,"Nope...nope...nope. It had been a long time since I had been to Red Robin, but when it came to mind tonight I was excited about a nice big burger and those tasty bottomless fries.  I was seated and waited on promptly and given a menu. Since I had been there they've really expanded the menu with seemingly great options, but I was so disappointed.  I got there basic burger with cheese and my husband got the Burnin' Love which have been our go to burgers anytime we've ever dined there. We've always enjoyed those specific burgers and if it ain't broke, don't fix it right? I decided to try the garlic parmesan fries and my husband did the regular to complement our burgers.  My burger had bland meat lacking in a great grilled flavor and it was so soggy I had to eat it with a fork. My fries were an absolute joke (I paid an extra $1.49 for them),they came out soaked in oil that was creating a puddle on my plate and heavy chunks of garlic all over them. My husbands burger had watery salsa making it not very desirable and definitely not what he remembered from before. His regular steak fries were good as they've always been, so a couple of points there.  Our tab ended up being $38 for our two burgers, fries, tea and a limeade. Not a bad price had it been some really great burger and fries, but a terrible price for feeling like you got a Chili's quality meal. Their specialty is burgers, so I would expect something really good and unfortunately that didn't happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Erin V.,"Magnolia, TX",35,60,15,3.0,8/16/2017,"Pretty boring food for a decent price. To be fair, I don't go for all the fancy add-ons and all of that but it's a basic burger with good fries. I do like the kids meals prices and the bottomless side that is offered with the kids meals. It's nice that they can get ""refills"" of their salad or fruit or fries. Service is always great but we go here when we are in the area because it's an easy way to get back on the highway and we know the service will be good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Jolene D.,"Houston, TX",259,163,172,1.0,12/29/2017,Asked for welldone burger and it was very pink. I had an empty glass for most of my visit. The wait staff was nice and I understand they are busy but the seating area is cramped. The fruit portions are tiny and we never got refills on fries. The receipt didnt print out at the table. What was supposed to be an hour lunch turned into nearly 2. Some people have to go back to work! We cant wait around like the families on Christmas break. This location is also a bit difficult to get to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Kelly H.,"Katy, TX",7,5,,1.0,12/29/2017,"This place has the worst service. We've given it several chances because the food (if you get it) is decent. The waiters are rude, and you get ignored. The last time we went, we waited for 15 minutes for someone just to take our drink order before we finally just gave up and went somewhere else. It's not worth the hassle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Elliott N.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,6,,2.0,1/5/2018,"My wife and I dined at this location, and we were very disappointed in the service that was provided. We got there around 6PM on a Thursday night, walked up to the hostess desk and requested a table for 2. There were several empty tables in sight, so we were confused at the fact that they told us it would be a 15 minute wait. Bewildered, but excited for the dining experience that we had in store, we asked if we could sit at the bar while we waited. The hostess giggled and said ""I don't know."" We look at the bar, it's empty. With a confused look, I asked if the bar was open seating, as many if not all bars are in this great country are. She continued to laugh and confirmed that she did not know the answer to what I believe is a very simple question. Confused, we wistfully made our way to the waiting room. During this time we looked on as they sat at least two parties of three, that did not have reservations. Neglected, hungry, and vulnerable we watched on as the host and hostesses strategically negotiated which of the two dozen empty tables they would sit this troublesome party of two. It was like watching two fierce competitors strategically moving their pawns to conquer Magnolia in the board game War. In awe of this overly complicated process, I watched as the hostess drew up what must have been the most complex hypothetical scenario, and concluded that they had found the one and only table for us. We sat down at our destined table only to notice the crunch of glass under our feet. The salt shaker had fallen, and nobody had cleaned it up. Annoyed, I threw some salt over my shoulder for good luck and alerted the waiter.  Finally, it was the moment we've all been waiting for.... the bottomless fries. Well, ""bottomless"" is somewhat of a deceiving term, as they come in nearly empty baskets with about 7 fries in each basket. Yes, you can request as many as you want, but in order to receive a ""normal"" portion of fries you have to request like 7 refills. This makes you leave feeling like an Angus Heifer heading to slaughter. The campfire sauce was delightful, and after an amount of refills that is not socially acceptable, we received our main course. My fish and chips were great, but I wish I would have taken them up on the pint recommendation, ole' sport. My wife received the entirely wrong burger, but we didn't want to complain as our frustration was most likely visible. I'm not sure if my wife and I will ever be back, as we coined their new advertising phrase... ""Red Robin.... DONE"" (instead of yum).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy

Michelle L.,"Katy, TX",73,70,60,5.0,1/7/2017,"I haven't been to a Red Robin in several years. There isn't a reason for that, it's just that Katy and Houston have so many new restaurants popping up all over the place that I sort of forgot about Red Robin. However, my husband was in the mood for a great burger and suggested we have lunch there today, so off we went! And I'm so happy we did! My husband ordered their classic Bacon Cheeseburger with steak fries and I ordered their new Avocado Chicken Wedgie with a side salad. It's a grilled chicken breast wrapped in iceburg lettuce that is stuffed with avocado, bacon, and tomato. Mmmmmmm. Everything was fresh and amazingly delicious. I feel like Red Robin has a lot of healthier options on their menu as compared to a few years ago. I was thoroughly impressed with the food and the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Angelique A.,"Katy, TX",121,237,84,4.0,11/5/2016,"Does Red Robin have a bad rep or something? Everyone looks at me like I'm crazy when I say I freaking love Red Robin but I do. I really do! I think their food is so good. And bottom less steak fries? Come on! I guess I can only speak for this particular Red Robin since it's the only one I've been to in years. Sometimes after work I just come here and treat myself.  The waitresses are all very nice and friendly and attentive. My favorite is the one who doubles as a bartender in the afternoons. I think her name is Jennifer maybe? She's from the midwest and very lively and energetic. She makes you feel welcome and like she enjoys talking to customers. Once I was eating here and I wanted a hot fudge sundae which used to be on the menu but isn't anymore, I guess. She made it for me anyway and it was delicious. Reminded me of when I was a kid. Try the poutine fries on their specials menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy

Toi S.,"Dallas, TX",53,34,15,4.0,5/30/2017,"4 stars, is quite generous of me actually. I was craving junk, I wanted a burger made from real beef, Red Robin has always been a crowd pleaser coupled with endless steak fries, why not right?!  While my burger was hot and fresh, it the meat it self was almost tasteless, the sesame seed bun took over my bacon cheeseburger with provolone cheese, and the fixings on the side.  I was expecting a juicy cut of meat. I also ordered boneless hot wings, good enough, steak fries were hot, could of used a tad bit more crisp to them, but hey they weren't cold and soggy. The bartender was nice enough, not full of conversation which was fine, but a little pep in her step couldn't have hurt the show.  I wouldn't run back here again, as nothing was memorable, I'm here for work, I prefer not to eat crap, but when in Rome..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Y C.,"Katy, TX",0,30,2,3.0,7/19/2017,"This has been a pretty regular place for my family ever since it was built. Their burgers and other items on the menu are good and the service has always been great. The only negative I have is in recent years we have noticed their burger and epecially the fish on their fish and chips get much smaller and smaller without a change in price to reflect that change. As a matter of fact the prices are a bit higher. Just enough that it's easy to miss it if you don't go often enough to know their prices. This is unfortunate because the fish and chips is actually one of our family favorites when we're not in the mood for burgers. When they first opened you got 4 large pieces of fish that were so big that they laid over the bed of fries and covered them. They were so big and delicious. I often couldn't finish them but were a good size for my husband, who eats much bigger portions than I do. Then a couple years ago the fish were cut more narrow but similar in length as in the past. Then they got shorter and shorter over time. Tonight, the fish were cut the smallest I had ever seen them. You can tell they took 2 of what used to be their fish and cut them in half to serve the 4 pieces. I was so disappointed that I mentioned it to our server, who I know has been there for a while because he has served us a number of times. He shrugged his shoulder and said he didn't know they had changed. Oh come on. He's been there long enough to know.... Anyway we won't be considering Red Robin as the top of our list of places to eat out at any more. It will remain a possible choice only if we are in the mood for anything else specifically on their menu. Bye for the time being RR....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Jeff W.,"Katy, TX",0,43,24,2.0,10/20/2017,This is such a mediocre place I remember when they used to be good but those days have long since passed. The burgers just average to bland. I got the sriracha burger and couldn't even taste the heat. It tasted like a lame burger made at home with American slices cheese melted on top.  They are all about bottomless fries but they are so bland why would you want more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Cory E.,"Houston, TX",61,83,82,4.0,11/1/2016,"Had a great experience at this place and I think it was driven by the fact that our server was so amazing. Faith was friendly, talkative (and not in the awkward, please leave me alone so I can eat kind of way), and actually seemed engaged by what we had to say. She kept our drinks always full without us having to ask for refills, she checked in with enough frequency to get us what we needed without becoming too present. If I can get seated at her table always I would come back often.  Started with some pretzel bites with beer cheese and I wasn't impressed. The cheese lacks flavor and the pretzels need more salt.  Out entrees were the BLTA and the Marco Polo. The BLTA was good and had plenty of meat and the bread was fresh. I had never had the Marco Polo and it's a chicken sandwich with aioli, arugula, and bacon and it was delicious. Juicy chicken and flavorful bacon made it all I could have asked for.  The best part is that they set up table top entertainment now that also allows you to order refills, appetizers, and desserts on your own right from your seat. And if you need a distraction you can pay to play trivia or many other games. At the end you can also pay your bill from it and never have to wait on your check to come out again. It's an ingenious idea that needs to catch on everywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy
Josie W.,"Katy, TX",0,6,,5.0,5/7/2017,"Resturant just got renovated and it looks very trendy and nice. All seats are padded, not just booths. It's very clean and the staff is friendly. I always get the bacon guacamole burger and it's cooked perfectly every time. They have the best onion rings I've ever had. I also really enjoy the southwestern salad. The wraps/sandwiches also look appetizing but I can't just not order my favorite burger. It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy

We had a short stack of their perfectly crispy onion rings and the Burnin' Love burger...it was cooked medium like we asked and very tasty and of course it came with the bottomless fries - which are thick steak cut fries (my absolute fav)! Gerardo had them split it for us since we tend to do smaller portions and even gave us a to go container of fries (perhaps because we never asked for more and they are 'bottomless').

If you try their burger, listen to me... Order their ""Red Robin burger"" that has eggs and bacon on it.  And ADD an extra beef patty.  This burger is freaking delicious as a double stack.  Plus, you get a side order of bottom-less fries.  They bring you a super fresh batch every time!  Reeeeed Robin, yummm..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=40

They do it without being asked. Reason I why I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is because I ordered a burger that was supposed to be bacon lovers, I forgot the name, I think pig out burger. I only got 2 slices of bacon and barely any bacon aioli sauce. Cmon now! That's ridiculous, I expect the burger overflowing with bacon. But it was a good burger. Just not how I expected it!

B B.,"Katy, TX",46,2,1,2.0,7/16/2016,"My husband, 3-year-old son and I visited this location today around 2pm after a photo session at the JCPenney directly across from the restaurant. I am 9 months pregnant, was super hungry, had never been to Red Robin and it was right there. So I said why not? We were promptly seated by a nice, attentive hostess who answered my husband's questions about the best/most popular menu items.  Our server, Perry, arrived a few minutes later to take our drink orders and we all asked for lemonades. After the drinks arrived, we decided to order the boneless wings appetizer with buffalo sauce and barbecue sauce on the side.  Perry came back about 15 minutes later to take our entree orders, but didn't mention our appetizer, i.e. ""It'll be out soon."" As he walked away, I told my husband ""I hope he didn't forget our appetizer."" Another 10-15 minutes went by before Perry arrived with the wings. Well, I can't say they were worth the wait. There was too much breading so they were a bit hard, and there was an aftertaste as though they had been fried in old oil. The barbecue sauce was just OK, but I really liked the buffalo sauce. Also, the fried potato chips that came with the wings were extremely salty. I was only able to eat one.  Now, here comes the worst part of our dining experience. As I was sipping my strawberry lemonade through a straw, I noticed a strange, pinkish smear on the rim of my glass. For reference, my lips had never touched the glass as I only drink with straws at restaurants. I decided to wipe at the smear with a napkin and it was lipstick! Obviously, it was someone else's, as I had only drank through the straw and I wasn't even wearing any lipstick. I was thoroughly disgusted that I had been served a drink in a dirty glass that clearly hadn't been washed since the previous customer used it. I was shocked. I set the drink aside and waited for Perry. My husband motioned him over a few minutes later, and I told him my glass had lipstick on it as I showed him the smear. All he said was ""I'll get you another one"" as he grabbed the drink and walked away. At the very least, I expected an apology and an offer to deduct the cost of the drink from our bill. However, I decided to let the situation go as I had already decided I was never coming back. I just wanted to eat my burger and go home.  My husband and I both had the Southern Charm Burger. It was quite good, but a bit small in my opinion considering it cost $14+. Our bill(including the tip) was about $65. I thought our dining experience was overpriced considering the underwhelming appetizer, lipstick-smeared glass, service and the small portions. The next time my family wants burgers, we'll take our money elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=40

Adam S.,"Katy, TX",176,447,603,4.0,3/4/2014,"I am trying to find the best burger joint in Katy.  Unfortunately, RR does not make the cut.  As you will see in other reviews: ""overpriced burgers"", and this pretty much sums it up...but do go to RR for a drink. I had the smoke and pepper burger.  The burger was big and juicy.  The bun was not dry.  Delicious...this was a good burger.  It also packs in over 1000 calories, so be prepared.  Note that RR has a list of other items you can substitute for the fries, some with an up-charge, some not.  I had the black beans and they were a good complement to the meal. Our service was good.  Nick answered our questions and kept us happy. There were three people in our party...two burgers, an order of fish tacos, an iced tea and two waters.  $45 seems a little high for what we received.  This place is a great restaurant except for the prices. As noted in other reviews, RR has offered discounts when showing your Cinemark movie tickets, but call ahead to verify. I have been to the bar area at RR in the past, and it is a great place to meet after coming back to the Cinemark park-and-ride after work.  The bartenders are friendly and  drink prices are reasonable.  Appetizer specials are also available. Anyway, for taste, service and cost, I still have not seen a burger joint in the Katy area that compares to Fuddruckers at Katy Mills or Whataburger near Westheimer Parkway/Grand Parkway.

My husband was ""warm"" but just barely.  Then, after removing the bun and veggies there was 2 TINY ""pieces"" of avocado, no complete slices, as if they were left over from someone else's plate. The hamburger patty was all split in half and they'd used to cheese as glue to hold it all together.  My husbands party was even worse.

It too was very good. The bottomless fries that comes with the burgers are very good too. They offer several variations on home made ketchup. I was not impressed with the spicy smoked pepper and a sweet hot. Neither one was very spicy and definitely not hot. Regular ketchup will do just fine. Iced tea was very good. Clean and crisp tasting. They also offer a bottomless root beer float. Maybe next time. The menu is huge. They offer all kinds of burgers, seafood dishes, wraps, soups and salads. We will go back to try Red Robin again. The food is about 3.5 stars. The pricing is s little pricey for the portion size. Out server made the visit very pleasant.

The meat was very thin, and more resembled and tasted like what you would get on a whopper from Burger King.  It was not at all a gourmet burger.  We could not finish them, complained to the waitress, and ended up ordering something else to eat.  When we got our check, we were charged for both burgers.  Rather than cause an issue with our waitress who appeared to be new, we paid the check and left.  When our waitress took our uneaten plates of food back to the manager, he should have removed them from our ticket instead of charging us for the poor quality of food we received.

The speckled lemonade was also good.  When we arrived we were led to a table with food and dirty napkins under it, I had to ask for it to be swept up as I'm in a orthotic boot and really didn't want someone's dirty napkin on it. The service was slow, we sat with empty drinks for quite sometime, as well as waited to pay our check. The worst part of our meal was my daughters grilled chicken sticks off the kids menu came out cold, literally cold. The plate was warm, but dirty, it had some white cheese like something stuck to the top of the corner of the plate. It was quite dirty, though dirty dishes are never what you want anywhere. I sent the chicken back and happen to notice it was placed under the heat lamps. When I saw our waitress I asked if they were making new ones or just reheating the old ones. She walked back to the kitchen and then threw them away. If I had not said anything I'm wondering if she would have been served reheated food. The manager brought her the new chicken as well as as the drink we had asked to be refilled 10 minutes earlier. He did not even offer an apology for the food being served cold and on a dirty plate.

Maggie M.,"Katy, TX",0,36,5,4.0,10/24/2013,"You come for the burgers but stay for the fries.  Not the place to come to if you are on a no carb diet.  Kids have fun here, the decor is covered with movie posters.  If you have kids they can grab a balloon on the way out, I know it's just a chain but the burgers are definitely above average and really good for the area",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=80

Couch-Pirate J.,"Katy, TX",7,9,5,4.0,1/2/2014,Our experience here was pretty typical to the franchise. Our serivec was veey spotty at first but the waiter comped us for our teas to make up for it without having to be asked. The Big Tavern Burger is not as big as it looks. Go for the Prime Chophouse or one of the other larger options.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=80
Sonia C.,"Katy, TX",153,173,95,5.0,11/1/2010,"It's a chain, but I like it. The food is tasty and the service is good. I usually get the boca burger and French fries, and sometimes the fried zuchinni appetizer. The burger and fries are really good, and the fries are ""bottomless,"" so you can always ask for more if you like. The fried zuchinni is REALLY good. That's some of the best fried zuchinni I've ever had, but be aware that it is served really hot. Their iced tea is always fresh, and the servers are there to offer plenty of refills.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the natural burger and didn't realize that didn't come with a Boca patty. I'm a vegetarian, so when I was served a regular burger I was pretty disappointed that I'd be paying for a meal that I couldn't eat. Otoniel was our server, and he was really nice about changing my order, and I appreciated that tremendously. The manager even came out and told us that my food (reorder) would be out shortly. I felt bad because it was my fault, but I really liked that they made sure I had the food I wanted anyway. That's great customer service.  The children have ordered from the children's menu- cheese pizza, grilled cheese and macaroni and cheese. They have been delighted with all three options. You have a choice of a few fruits or French fries with the children's menu items.  Good place. I recommend it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=80
Karen F.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/14/2015,"I can't give stars because there are not any minus stars. There on Feb 7, 3:24 in afternoon. Service was ok but here is the problem. My husband ordered a Stella giant which we were told was 22 oz.  the beer came in a Stella glass which we also have at home (16 oz). He asked the waitress was this 22 oz and she said she did not know so she offered to get manager. The manager was Mike Milligan. My husband asks him if this is a 22 oz Stella and he says ihe believes it is. My husband explains we have same glass and this is not 22 oz and what are we going to be charged for. Mr Milligan says a giant Stella. We tried to explain to him it was 16 oz  . He got smart and rude to my husband and raised his voice . Really. What else are you no be truthful about?  Food was ok but what is really funny is that another restaurant in same area had just hired 2 people from that Red Robin because of Milligan. Out and out lying...yes that's sure how to bring your customers back.  I'm going to tell as many folks as I can about Red Robins care for its   I have the receipt to show he charged us for a Giant Stella and measure the Stella Glass 16 oz. to many places to get a burger here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=80
Pat C.,"Katy, TX",15,27,,4.0,11/3/2010,"Good food, as any Red Robin.  Staff are nice.  For a kid friendly restaurant, however, the hostesses seem confused where to seat parties with more than two children. Our kids love it and there are many selections for them to choose from.  We love the veggie burger, although any of the burgers on the menu can be made with a Boca or Gardenburger patty.  We will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=80

Ron T.,"Katy, TX",164,41,18,5.0,3/5/2012,"Lots of fun!  Kids love it.  I think it's a GREAT marketing idea to have ""endless"" steak fries...I mean, how many potatoes could that cost the company and yet we love to ask for more fries because we can!  Great selection of special burgers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=80

Veronica A.,"Cypress, TX",9,8,,5.0,5/30/2011,"This place is GREAT! The Loaded Chili Cheese Fries and The Lone Star Burger are finger lickin good. If you love CCFries these will not disappoint at all. And if you like Guac and Salsa on your burger the Lone Star combines the two flavors on the burger in such a way i cant get enough. The Bleu Ribbon Burger on Onion Loaf is amazing as well. I enjoyed the onion loaf so much so, I will request it for all my burgers in the future. I do have one sour note, the Burning Love Burger looks awesome, but it will disappoint, do not order it!...Can't wait to go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=80

Paula H.,"Katy, TX",0,7,,2.0,3/1/2012,"I was just really not that impressed with this place. I've done well over my fair share of restaurant-hopping so I know what's out there. And let me say that this place was subpar. Quality of my burger was poor. One of the biggest turn-offs for me in a restaurant is when a waiter seats me at a sticky, dirty table. And that was the case here. Gross! The wait was...a little too long. Made me anxious. I don't recommend it if you're looking for genuinely good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=100

I had the mushroom swiss burger and a diet coke, my husband had the whiskey burger.  We both gobbled it down, as well as our fries.  We were very interested in the ginger bread milk shake and chocolate pie, but too full to stuff anything else in our gullets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy?start=100
