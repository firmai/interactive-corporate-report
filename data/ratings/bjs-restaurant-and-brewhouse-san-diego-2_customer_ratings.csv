324,Shannon S.,"Escondido, CA",503,605,187.0,5.0,2013-10-30,"Awesome! Love their pizza and the beer section here. I was skeptical of the bacon, chicken, ranch pizza, but the combo actually works really well. Their enlightened Ahi salad is another favorite of mine. The grilled steak salad is really tasty with the warm grilled veggies and blue cheese tossed into the mix. BJ's has a ton of beer on tap. If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, their bottle selection is pretty impressive as well. They even have root beer and cream soda on draft. You can't come to BJ's and not have a pazookie. These things are a billion calories each, but they are so evil and good. Warm cookie out of the oven with vanilla ice cream melting on top. They even have a small size for sharing, or to hog all for your fatty self.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=320,3.572,3.572,3.572,3.572,3.572

Like the first reviewer, this place is not even open yet but I am way cooler than her because tonight was their soft opening...oh I did not go inside, but I drove by it and I could see that it was 5 stars just from that. I could tell that the pizza was cooked to perfection and the service was better than any other location.

643,Kathrina M.,"San Diego, CA",85,37,,3.0,2013-11-16,"Came for a soft opening dinner 11/16/13. The place is a big cube with no windows which is a little disappointing considering it's San Diego and it's always nice out.  We had a set menu which included potstickers for an appetizer and the choice of BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, Turkey Club Sandwich,  Balsamic Glaze Chicken, and BJs Favorite Pizza. We were happy to have good choices. The potstickers were cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce was savory.  The Balsamic Chicken dish was delicious and had an equal balance of chicken mashed potatoes and spinach with crispy onions. The deep dish pizza had a generous amount of toppings and was soft in the middle and nice and crunch crust on the edges. The salad on the other hand was pretty disappointing.  I'd rather pick one up at Trader Joes. It was basically a big bowlful of shredded iceberg lettuce and a couple black beans, corn kernels, and 6 cubes of chicken. Our table agreed it would be the only thing we wouldn't order again. The guys in our party pointed out that their beers did not have the proper head so they appeared flat even though they tasted fine.  Overall, the service was impressive for a soft opening and the food was great, aside from the salad. I'll be back for the regular menu for the grand opening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=640,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006

Kaitlyn was the best server I have had in a while. Food was perfect like I expected. We had a pre selected menu of mozzarella sticks and fried chicken with corn and mashed potatoes.  My meal was so good I will order it again. The pizza was great. The wait was like 20 mins even with our reservation which they offered to us. That's the only reason I almost gave 4 stars. They were not organized at all. People without reservations were walking in and they only had one little dude out front to keep track. He wasn't able to so anyone could have said they had an apt.

Every server we met was very polite and we never had to wait for drinks. We got just a plain deep dish pepperoni pizza in a combo with a wedge salad and clam chowder. The chowder was fabulous, according to the hubsters. We did have to wait a while for our pizza, but it was great!  We also a red velvet cookie with vanilla bean ice cream (they had some weird word for it.) and it was the best thing I've ever had in my entire life. I'm not even kidding. I could have died and gone to heaven right there. I did read somewhere that the wait staff was still in training, but there had to be a 3-1 ratio of servers to customers. It was packed with STAFF and it was a little upsetting that I couldn't even talk to my hubsters for more than a minute or two without someone interrupting us asking how our food was.

(I have ordered this before at other locations) I would recommend the soup bowls preferably in Calm Chowder. (I didn't even know they had bread bowls until I actually scanned the menu and it is literally the best bread bowls here) There Pizookies are okay, there too sweet but its worth trying. I don't recommend eating one by yourself lol I did that the first time I got it in Red Velvet. Also the service here is quick and they ALWAYS check up on you! I would definitely come back to this location and it looks fancy vs. all the other Bj's location I been too... PS.

498,Joe C.,"San Diego, CA",120,135,142.0,4.0,2013-11-22,"We were on our way for a quick snack at Smash Burger in Hazard Center when we noticed BJ's looked open? I could swear I was here only a week ago, and they didn't even look close to being ready for business. There were televisions on on the nice patio, a fireplace going on the patio as well, people walking in and out....they were open! They opened on Monday, 4 days earlier. Well screw Smash Burger, this place looks dope! We walked in the cool rotating doors (Love Rotating Doors), and wow, this place is huge! Its like one giant room with high ceilings. On the left wall is the kitchen, and the right wall is a bar, with lots of bottles and colored lights. Its got this cafeteria feel when you first walk in, but not in a bad way.  I manage a restaurant, so I'm paying attention to everything. Having just gone through a grand opening 10 months ago, I know how hard opens can be. They of course had plenty of staff on, the hostess staff were very friendly, and when a host sat us, he was surprisingly knowledgeable for a host. He offered us the rundown on craft beers and cocktails, and even threw in ""his favorite"" was the orange soda, nice suggestive sell guy! I got the orange soda, it was great! I remember thinking, that guy was a fantastic host, he'd be a server in no time.  Our server was nice, did a great job of suggesting appetizers and entrees he liked. They did switch servers on us halfway through the meal, which I don't recommend doing. You cant possibly be worried about labor during the first week of opening. Anyhow, our second waiter was actually better than the first, sorry, he had more personality and definitely felt more comfortable taking about the food.  So for the food: The fried hush pup (I think) with the bacon aioli was bomb. Like little donuts with bacon mayo. The margarita flatbread pizza was good, nothing too special.  Chicken lettuce wraps were better than good, but the spicy mustard is hot! I put too much on and gassed my nose pipes.  The warm cookie with ice cream was too damn good. I gobbled that thing down. We got the ""mini"" version of that dessert, and it was the perfect size.  Overall, we only ate apps and desert, so I'll be back to try entrees and maybe they can squeeze another star out of me.  Nice job new BJ's, I look forward to coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=520,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006

Weird.  The service was slow, we had to flag someone down every time we wanted another beer. When we were able to place an order it took 15 minutes for our waitress to return with our drinks every time. The number one rule for customer service at a restaurant is to keep your guests drinks full!

When they opened this location we couldn't wait to see what they had to offer. We walked in to about ten employees waiting by the hostess desks...odd, but maybe they were waiting to clock in?!?! We gave the lady the number in our party and she told us to step to the side and wait to be seated. She had lovely eyelids...we never once had eye contact as she was busy typing away. Seconds later we were whisked away by our hostess we gave us a very well rehearsed sales speech about their specials ( i hate the ""our specials of the night"" speeches! It's like a website with flash) i kindly interrupted her to ask where she was from,she was very sweet, handed us our menus and disappeared into the sea of employees. Our first...yes first waitress walked over quickly and I told us her name. She was kind of a blur,either she downed ten cans of red bull or had someplace to be. I noticed a waiter behind her standing with a stopwatch....ummm okayyyyy lol. I guess she was just our drink waitress since we never saw her again. A second chick brought  us our drinks,a third took our order and maybe dropped off our food. All the waitresses were pleasant,not one had a bad attitude, but not one went above and beyond to make our visit memorable. I'm assuming most are still training or perhaps just stalk one another as most had a confused coworker following them.  We noticed a group of workers off to the side just standing.....BJs cult?!?!? Lol  Now for the important stuff.... I ordered their stout... The worst stout I have ever had. It tasted watered down,not strong and full of flavor. Maybe it was an old batch?!? I couldn't finish it.  For food we had the roasted veggie flatbread... It was ehhh. The mac and cheese..again ehhh. As well as the the cookie and cream desert...tasted familiar.  I would go back,maybe it a few months...when the customers out number the staff lol.

536,Elizabeth C.,"San Diego, CA",91,335,258.0,4.0,2013-12-02,"Welcome to Mission Valley BJ's!  I discovered BJ's Restaurant and Brewery 12 years ago when I was living in Boulder and I have been a fan ever since.  After Maria Maria shut down a couple of years ago, this location sat sad and vacant for far too long.  Then one glorious day there was a sign announcing a BJ's was coming soon.  Excellent choice!  This means in Mission Valley alone you have San Diego Brew Co, Gordon Biersch, Lazy Dog, and BJ's (just to name a few) for a place to get some food and drink some good beer.  Yum! BJ's always has awesome pizzas and calzones.  I tend to make my own calzone to avoid an overload of pork options that I am allergic to.  It's so nice when restaurants offer a ""build your own"" option, and I wish more did.  Their sandwiches are delicious, especially the beef dip.  When I had lunch at this location just a week ago, we started our lunch off with an ahi poke appetizer, my husband enjoyed a bison burger, and I got the grilled maui mahi.  We also enjoyed some pints of their harvest pumpkin beer, and it was very tasty.  BJs has over a dozen of their own beers to choose from on tap, from your lightest ales to your darkest stouts, they will have something for you to enjoy. For dessert we got a pizookie  (baked cookie with ice cream on top).  They have multiple cookies to chose from and you can even mix and match for a half and half choice.  So we got half red velvet and half white macadamia nut cookie a la mode with French vanilla ice cream. I felt the service was up to speed and the staff were all friendly.  Even the manager stopped by and asked how we were enjoying our meal.  Considering I went here shortly after they opened color me impressed.  I've seen restaurants fall apart in their first month of being open, and I'm not seeing that as the case for BJs. Parking is shared with the other businesses of Hazard Center.  I don't ever have a problem with parking, but I'm sure on more busy/popular nights for that shopping center it can become a bit more chaotic.  That's to be expected for Hazard Center.

450,Ali M.,"San Diego, CA",17,54,7.0,1.0,2013-12-04,"I tried giving this place a second chance today and it failed. Again. Yes, they just opened, but just opening is no excuse whatsoever for super crappy service and a manager who could not give a flying crap about the customers. There is a difference between working out the kinks and just sucking.  I made a reservation for a group of 8 at 11:30 two days prior. I got there at 11:20 by myself. I sit down waiting for 10 minutes. Keep in mind there is almost no one in the restaurant at the moment so it should not take this long. Some of my co-workers arrived and still no table. Someone came over to us and asked us if we needed any help. They had completely forgotten about me and clearly the word 'reservation' means different things to different people.  We sit down at 11:45. The waitress takes our drinks and orders. 12:30 rolls around and NO FOOD YET. We did not each order ribs with a side of burgers and steaks. The food should not take that long (salads, pasta, and sandwiches...really?).  I looked around for a manager for about 20 minutes and did not see one in sight. Finally, someone at my table asked for a manager. Fernando comes over. My co-worker expressed his numerous concerns in a very polite and concise fashion. When he told the manager he should be walking around and that not one out of eight of us had seen him so we could get his attention, he pointed aimlessly towards the other side of the restaurant and said he was walking around over there.

That issue needs to be addressed.  The food and beer of course was amazing like usual and the place looks great, but I warn you if you get Justin just ask for a new section so you can enjoy your meal.

They did a nice reconstruction of the space since taking over the former Maria Maria spot at Hazard Center. Good sight lines, and traffic flow between tables moves nicely, with accessibility from one end to the other. Neat firepit at the patio. Service today was very good for being recently open and having a new staff on board. Our waiter checked on us regularly, and I wasn't worried about overhearing the trainer give some reminders and coaching on the side. It's encouraging to see that they make the effort to strive for quality customer service. A nice lunch. I tried the boneless buffalo wing appetizer, but I don't know...kinda plain for me. They have better app options. Maybe it was the coating. We shared a deep dish pizza. Hearty toppings, cheesy bites, good crust. Very filling and we took home the extra slices that I snacked on later. You can never have too many snacks when the sports are on. Of course, we got a Pizookie©. It's just one of those simple desserts that we usually don't pass on: smooth vanilla ice cream atop a warm, soft chocolate chip cookie right from the oven.

I wish they would be diligent about your water as well but they were good about watching if people wanted more refills on beer. I was surprised that the pizza was not greasy but I guess it just depends on what you get. We ordered two large pizzas: The Chicken Bacon Ranch and the BJ's Original. I was surprised of how little pizza sauce was on the BJ's Original. I guess I didn't fully read the description. There are a lot of chunky ingredients on there like olives, cube tomatoes, onions, it's like you're getting your healthy serving of veggies on a piece of bread. The pizza dough wasn't doughy but it was more like on the simple bread side. Good bread. But since it was lacking pizza sauce it was kinda dry and you had the urge to dip it in something. I usually don't need hot sauce or ranch to dip my pizza but I felt that I needed it for this one. The Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza wasn't my first choice but friends wanted it. It turned out that it was not overpowered by ranch. Actually, didn't really taste much ranch. You'll probably enjoy the bacon pieces if you like bacon. I'm just meh about bacon in general. Depends on my mood. It was pretty cheesey though. I think there was cheddar and mozzarella.  Again, the location is huge and they have an outside patio with a fire pit. I can imagine on a beautiful San Diego day that it would be awesome to sit out there. Oh yeah, there are TV's all around so hopefully you're lucky enough you're sitting by a corner of them so you can enjoy the hockey and basketball game at the same time. I'll be back to enjoy other BJ's menu items at this location but it doesn't feel smooshed in regards to spacing of the restaurant. Be warned, the parking lot is kinda small and I can imagine during prime lunch and dinner times you're stalking those who are leaving or you just park far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=500,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.8600000000000003,3.4400000000000004

Service was fantastic.  Had a good handle on the beer selection, fast, non-intrusive, and friendly.  We got the avocado egg rolls (delicious), wings (I didn't have any myself), a large Great White pizza (wonderful) and the mini trio of the pizookies (died and went to heaven).  We had a really pleasant time and I would definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=480,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.8640000000000003,3.5600000000000005

They told us it would be about a 20-25 minute wait. We were seated within 20 minutes. The server was very attentive, despite having all his tables full. He always made sure our cups were full.  I ordered an individual hand-tossed vegetarian pizza. It was okay, & I have definitely had better. They were very stingy with the bell peppers, but put too many black olives on it. Boo! Also, they need to add sweetened iced tea (not Brisk) to their beverage menu. I had high hopes for this BJs, and I can't give it anything higher than 3 stars right now.

Since they are a new location their menu is much smaller but our server failed to tell us that so we didn't know what options had changed from the traditional menu.  My boyfriend always orders the Chicken Parmigiana every single time we eat at a BJs and he always specifies 'the one with the spaghetti noodles' because they have menu items with the same name.  When we saw that they had brought out the wrong dish, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken instead of the Chicken Parmigiana, we kindly corrected them and patiently said that it was okay because this had happened before.  Two things went wrong after this: the foodrunner didn't communicate with the server and so they brought out yet another wrong dish. After bringing out two wrong dishes and ten minutes of painfully trying to explain what the freaking Chicken Parmigiana was, our server finally said 'Oooh yeah I'm sorry, I don't know what that is because our menu here is smaller since we've just opened up'.  (Obviously they hired servers who have no knowledge about their business or their traditional menu). In the end, my boyfriend ate something he did not intend to order at all, it was brought out twice so it was cold, and they basically threw the chicken on a bed of boiled spaghetti noodles with no sauce.  Okay, they tried to make the Chicken Parmigiana but if we had been told that the menu was different from the get go, all of this could have been avoided and I might have given this location a better rating. For now, I would suggest eating at the more established BJs locations if you are a regular and like to order the same thing because their menu here is reduced and the servers, unfortunately, won't tell you that until you've realized that you wasted your time and money..and the company's as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=580,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.604,3.2400000000000007

The second time around was a Sunday afternoon, completely dead and still slow service. Now there was no excuse. Saw the workers huddled in groups chatting rather than waiting on their tables.

They have happy hour during game days at the bar area.  First of all the food is great as usual...that I have no complaints about.   The beginning of our lengthy stay at BJ's for both the play off games and Super bowl started out great, good service in the beginning and when our server left for the day we cashed out and our server informed the next server that we would be staying for the game.  That is when everything went down hill and we didn't get any service at the bar area.  During play offs we had to wave someone down to ask them where our server was...then the server barely came by our table.   But today was the worst....we were ignored...there was a server in our area serving everyone else, walked by or table multiple times and never said a word. Not even a ""hey, you girls doing ok, is someone helping you, can I get you anything?""... From the beginning of the national anthem to half time no service, we ended up having to go to the bar to order or food and drinks.  My friend ended up telling management how dissatisfied we were.  Then we finally had someone come over but we already started a tab with the bartender and just went to the bar when needed.   The Bartender staff was verry friendly and helpful and when the food came out they had someone deliver it to our table.  I will still come back because the food is really good and I liked that they added gluten free pizza to the happy hour menu.  Hopefully they will train the wait staff better.

I don't like bad service. However, ZERO service is beyond me. On my most recent visit, I actually had the opportunity to have what I could say was quite horrible service. I was sitting in the bar area as I usually do when I come here. And on this particular occasion my table went through 2 and almost three servers. The first two were great but had to stop serving my table due to schedule and shift changes. Not sure if the third person was not informed that they were supposed to cover our table, but she clearly knew to serve every other table in our section but mine. If anyone at our table wanted anything, we actually got better service by walking over to the bartender and ordering food and drinks. The only person who stopped by our table to see if we needed anything was the person bussing tables. This kind of service would have made me walk out of the restaurant and I wanted too, however we were watching a playoff football game and wanted to stay and enjoy ourselves.  After being ignored completely from before the National Anthem to halftime -which is well over an hour, I had to complain to the manager. This is the first time that I have ever had to complain at a restaurant about piss poor service. You can't even call it service when you are NOT being served at all. A switch over is staff happened on a previous occasion that resulted in having our table ignored and not well taken card of. TWO THUMBS DOWN!! This kind service puts a bad taste in my mouth and makes me not want to go back.

I have enjoyed each one I have visited, as well as the Food, service, etc. all great reviews.  Carmel Mtn Ranch and Grossmont locations have been great! As I live in Mission Valley, myself and friends were all very excited when we saw B.J.'s coming soon! So we watched diligently for them to open. Then the day had come! We saw tons of people going in, and thought, ""well let's go!"" So we did. We were not greeted kindly at all. We made it into the front door, and were approached by a man that said, ""do you have an invite?"" We said., ""No' aren't you open?"" He said., ""No this is our Test night and invite only"" I have no problem with that except for the man could have been much more professional with his demeanor. So we left not feeling welcome at all. About 2 weeks went by, and we decided we would give it another shot as we were craving our favorite foods from there. So we were greeted very nicely this time. The date was 12/16/13 5:11pm. We had a female server at first, unfortunately I didn't remember her name. I have many food allergies, so I always order about 3 of the same items each time bcuz I know I can eat them safely and they are delicious. So I ordered the chicken flatbread as I always do, told her I had allergies to onions, garlic. So please make sure that their is no sauce. My friend ordered the same and 2 sodas. Simple, right? Wrong, it took over 30 MINUTES to get a soda, we were sitting directly across from the bar, my receipt shows table 805. The patrons at the bar drinking and being loud was difficult to have a conversation at a dining table since they are right next to each other. As I went to get up and go find our waitress, she came out of a swinging door and I asked about our drinks. Sh apologized, got our sodas right away. So she obviously forgot about us. Another 40 minutes went by and our food came out, both covered in Garlic sauce. Are you kidding me! We waited all this time and then it was wrong! She apologized and took it back. A few min later we were approached by Gabrielle, he was now going to take care of us as the other waitress was on a break. He asked what I ordered and he would take care of it, I was stunned at his gesture. I said, "" I already gave her my order and it is suppose to be getting remade already so why do I need to reorder?"" He stated ""he was taking care of us now"" with no other explanation. We were about to get up and leave and then my friend said he needed to use the restroom. Well B.J.'s employees, YOU never know who your customers are. My friend is a ""Health Inspector"". He returned to the table and said, let's go, you are not going believe what I just saw."" He said, ""an employee was in the bathroom the same time he was, as he was washing his hands, the employee relieved himself and walked right by the sink and walked out of the bathroom and straight to kitchen!"" As we got up our food arrived and we said NO Thank you and as we were leaving We saw the manager. So we went to him and explained everything that happened, and also stated we were leaving with out paying our Bill. He was apologetic and agreed.

We ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my friend got the mini one topping pizza for lunch. The sad thing is was he was almost done eating the pizza before my salad and soup arrived. My friend had to mention the fact that he never got his salad and that was brought about 10 minutes later. Once our food was brought to the table we Never saw our waitress again. Many servers walked past our table and didn't even acknowledge we were there. A bus boy cleaned our dishes off the table and I wasn't even done eating. ( yes the dishes were empty) but I would think that most people that order something that is endless would at least get a second serving if not more of it. Hence that's why they get the endless/unlimited version of it.  So here we were, sitting there waiting for our server to come back so I could get another bowl of soup and salad. SHE NEVER came back EVER!!!! I finally flagged down the hostess when she walked by to seat another customer and she said she would get them for us. 5 min later no one still appeared at out table. Saw the hostess what appeared to be walking around looking for our server but she  apparently  was no where to be found. We got up and walked up to the hostess stand and asked for our check. They said the server is working on it and the hostess stated that out server was missing in action. ( her words not ours) I told them I got the unlimited soup and salad and still hungry but at this point I just want to leave and go to jack in the box and eat something there.  They gave the excuse that their computer system was having some problems. I can give them that for the slow speed of getting the check to us but doesn't explain why we never seen our waitress or never got a second bowl of soup and salad.  A computer doesn't cause bad slow service.  So they ended up adding our total bill at the hostess stand with our help. They just apologized but never offered us a discount or a coupon for a possible next visit. They could have handled this much better.  Again I like BJ's and am ever a reward card holder and don't expect top notch service all the time but this was beyond bad service.

I was finally craving a french-dip last week and had time to go for lunch. I was seated quickly but had to wait about 15 minutes before someone acknowledged me at my table. I ordered promptly and waited another 15 minutes for my food. Ironically, I talked my self into getting a burger when I saw that they had a really cheap lunch special that sounded good. The burger was fine, except that it didn't have the grilled onions described in the menu. Since my hour long lunch was almost over by the time I got my lunch, I took a few bites before requesting a check and to-go box. Once someone came back with the bill, I handed them my card before they could get away again, since it might take another 10 minutes before they came by to collect my card. Anyway, I was overcharged for the burger because they didn't give me the lunch special. I told the hostess on the way out and she was unhelpful but apologetic. She told me she could try to get a manager if I want, which made me feel like I was making a big deal over a $2 charge. I think she should have insisted on getting it fixed, rather than making me feel like I was creating a problem, and frankly, I didn't have time and didn't want to feel stupid for making everyone deal with refunds over a $2 charge.

146,Juliana C.,"San Diego, CA",659,242,3280.0,3.0,2014-02-18,"I have been to a BJ's before in Sacramento, and they just opened a brand new location in Mission Valley. My BF was a little tired of eating Asian food and wanted something American. I suggested BJ's. American food and beer? Done.  It was not crowded at all for a Sunday night. Plenty of seating in the dining room, the bar area, and the outside patio. Initially I wanted to sit at the outdoor patio of course, because it was outside and there was a giant round fire pit, but it was a bit too cool outside for me, even with the space heaters, so we decided on a booth in the dining room. It was the middle booth, and had a view of the whole restaurant and several TV's.  For their hand crafted sodas and beer, I chose the root beer and black cherry to try. The beer, my BF started with the Abbey normal, and then wanted to try the Tatonka Stout, but they didn't have it, so he had the PM Porter instead. He liked both. As for the sodas, you can try a different soda each refill (which are free), I personally like the root beer the best.  We got the clam chowder to start. It was really good. If you like a lot of bread, I suggest getting the chowder in a bread bowl. I got the Grilled Chicken Pasta for my entree. It was good. The pasta was not drenched in cream, broccoli was steamed well, small soft pieces, and the chicken was a bit dry. I would've liked more chicken and broccoli for the pasta ratio. It was topped with 2 pieces of toasted bread. That was a bit dry as well, and asked for some marinara sauce, the sauce was perfect for the bread, but watch out, it has a kick! He decided to get the 12"" Gourmet Five meat Deep dish pizza. It had meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, ham and salami. I don't care for a lot of bread for pizza, but it was delicious!

676,Eric P.,"Escondido, CA",29,19,6.0,4.0,2014-02-18,"I often drop into BJs for happy hour which lasts until 7pm. I enjoy their personal pizzas (which are half price just $6) and a cold beer ( only $3.50) . I love their micro beers which they brew themselves. When ordering the pizza get the thin crust. It's larger and as a result you get a lot more toppings that way. I also like the fact that I can keep an eye on the game with their multi screen TV system while I eat. They are still more restaurant-brewery than sports bar but I find it a nice compromise between the two. They only put on the volume during a big game or the playoffs but at least you can enjoy the game while your eating. Dinner service is a little slower than happy hour or the bar and seems to be more hit or miss on the service. Over all I will give them 4 stars splitting the 5 stars for happy hour with the 3 stars for slower, spottier dinner service. The beer at happy hour for only $3.50 I would give 6 stars if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=660,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9280000000000004,3.2000000000000006

I would highly recommend putting yourself on their ""Call-Ahead"" list, especially if you're a party of 3+ and it's a weekend night. Calling ahead puts your name on their list, without having to be there. Usually, you still end up with a wait, but a much shorter one than if you had put your name on the list when you got there. Think 15 minutes vs. 40. The catch: you can't call more than 30 minutes ahead of time. However, you can seat yourself in the bar area without waiting.

As a heads up this is not the place for any seafood lovers.  The menu is extremely limited to burgers and chicken.  I only viewed a salmon dish, lobster bisque, and lobster tacos.  This made it tough for me to practice no meat Fridays during this lent season.  So I settled for the mini one topping deep dish lunch pizza (extra cheese).  I think the food would have tasted better if it didn't take close to 20 min to reach our table.  My friend enjoyed the salad with blue cheese dressing.  And that's all that can be said. The avocado spring rolls bland and drenched with chipotle sauce.  My friend's chicken quesadilla combined four triangles were smaller than my hand.  Pizza is pizza.  We left not hungry and definitely not satisfied.   From prior dining experiences I thought when close to finishing a meal a server would approach and ask how we are doing and ask is there anything else we may like.  At least refill a drink or two.  Well at this BJ's my expectations may be a little to high especially when customer really wants another salad or water.  My friend and I sat close to 15 min after no food was left on our plates.  Also be forewarned do not ask any one outside your server for anything.  I attempted to ask a different server within the restaurant to break a large bill so we could leave and pay the bill with an exact amount of the check plus tip.  We were quickly instructed your server has to do it.  Apparently shame on me for not wanting to sit for another 5-10 min with money I wish I didn't have spend here.  So my buddy and I went to the front and paid the billed.   He asked what should we do for tip and I said give two reasons where a tip was earned.  The hostesses were nice and for me thats where it stops. For the first time in my life I used the 10% marker of bad, bad, bad overall experience only because I was forced leave a tip.  Still I'm nice enough to know it may have just been my server and not the attitude of the restaurant.  2 Stars for appearance and greeting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=420,2.96,3.28,3.28,2.7280000000000006,3.152

651,Tiffany S.,"San Diego, CA",28,19,5.0,4.0,2014-04-14,"I will start off by saying that I LOVE LOVE LOVE their food- there are so many yummy things to choose from that I always have a hard time deciding.  However, a pazookie at the end of the meal is always a must.  I was so excited when I saw that they were opening up a location within walking distance to my house.  The building is beautiful on the outside but I was not as impressed with the inside.  They were going for young, bar scene as opposed to a family feel like their other restaraunts.  All in all I love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=640,3.04,3.3,3.3,3.056,3.1960000000000006
590,Kelly J.,"San Diego, CA",79,113,1017.0,3.0,2014-04-15,"The service or lack thereof has been heavily discussed in other reviews. Because of this, I will start this review by commenting on the service.  Here's is what I liked and what I think needs improvement about the service: Likes: 1) Our waitress was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and drink menu. 2) She was patient with all our questions and did not rush us with our order.  3) This is very cool......she told us when she was going on break and told us that another waiter would be checking up on us (our food and drink had arrived at that point). I can't tell you how many wait staff at other restaurants would disappear leaving us to wonder if they were done for the day or were taking a break. This was beyond professional. Nicely done! 4) She served us the first slice of pizza. It's the small things that add up. Needs Improvement: 1) While our waitress was on break, a gentleman wearing a blue shirt which was different from the rest of the wait staff, came over and asked if we wanted a box for our pizza. We had only finished two slices of pizza. I think it would have gone over better if he had first asked us if we were still working on the pizza. I understand restaurants are volume driven businesses, but making the customer feel rushed is not a model of great service. And who knows, maybe the customer will order dessert, more drinks etc. if they don't feel rushed. Just a thought.  2) Probably being a little nick picky here, but we ordered an appetizer, salad and pizza.  It would have been nice to ask if we wanted everything all at once or if we wanted the salad and appetizer first and then the pizza. Instead, they brought everything out at once without asking. This goes back to the first point about not making the customer feel rushed.  3) I had finished my tasters, but I was not asked if I wanted anything else to drink. Again, back to the first point.  Conclusion on Service: I have mixed feelings about the service. I can't say it was the worst service but I also can't say it was the best. I do not expect perfect service, but I also do not expect to feel rushed. There are tons of factors that account for awful service such as not enough wait staff on duty for the amount of customers, problems in the kitchen, lack of training, etc. None of these factors were present during our recent visit. So I do think they can fine tune their service a bit more. I realize service can be hit or miss at most places and this is only one visit. But, if they are that way with us then I have to assume they are that way with some of the other customers. That's my two cents on the service. The food was pricey but really good.  We ordered the crispy calamari, seared ahi salad, and the BJ's Favorite (aka supreme) hand tossed pizza. The crispy calamari came with two different dipping sauces, marinara and some kind of garlic mayo. Both were great complement to the perfectly fried calamari. The seared ahi salad was probably our favorite of the three. Everything in the salad was really fresh. As mentioned in my other reviews, I'm not a big salad fan but this was really delicious especially the buttery slices of avocado and the tender slices of seared ahi. The pizza was loaded with fresh toppings and came out nice and evenly cooked. I think the crust itself could use a little work, it's got a nice texture but it lacks any flavor. Because of this I did not bother finishing some of the crust.   I had the four 5oz beer tasters for $6.95 which is decent deal.  Mixing it up, I decided to go with the Tantonka Imperial Stout, BJ's Porter, Piranha Pale Ale and Hopstorm IPA. The Piranha Pale Ale was probably my favorite. It was very tasty and sweet for a low abv beer.  On the other hand, the Tantonka Imperial Stout lacked any thickness and seemed very forgettable for this style of beer. For imperial stout, it did not coat my mouth and the coffee, chocolate, etc flavors were lackluster. My wife had the mojito which she enjoyed and would order again.  This BJ's is a solid three stars for me. The food and some of the beer was really good, but it was a bit on the pricey side. When I come to restaurants during the weekend, I do not want to feel hurried. It's the weekend I want to relax and take it slow. This service did not cater to that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=400,3.12,3.28,3.28,2.9560000000000004,3.2160000000000006

147,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051.0,4.0,2014-05-08,"It's a chain restaurant, so you know what you're getting. The place was packed when we initially stopped by, but neither of us wanted to sit around waiting for an hour, so we decided to hit up the nearby Target to get some errands out of the way before circling back for dinner.   I'm glad we did that (not that the Target experience was great, because it really wasn't) - by the time we got back to the restaurant, there was no wait. We checked in and got seated at a booth right away, though the dining room was packed and loud.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We both ordered drinks and the calamari to start, before going through the menu. I decided to try a new item, the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, while my husband went with his usual order, the shrimp tacos.   It took a while for the calamari to be brought to our table, and I have to wonder if it's because they decided to fry the heck out of it. The little squid pieces were so deeply fried that they were almost burnt, and they were inedible. It's a shame, too, because we both really had a hankering for calamari.   The main dishes came out not too long after, and I admit, when I saw our waitress walking towards our table with the plates in hand, I wanted to laugh. The plates looked so tiny! Yes, we both ordered off of the ""Lighter Fare"" menu, but come on! The plates looked almost laughably small in her hands.   Still, once I started to tuck in, I realized that there was enough food on the plate to satiate me. The little pita tacos were interesting. The chicken was chopped into bite-sized pieces, and the pita was piled high with everything - chicken, diced tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs. It was supposed to come with a sauce for dipping, but they barely provided anything. If I order it again, I'd ask for extra sauce, because the ""taco"" itself can be a bit dry. The other thing it came with was a bulgur salad, which was delicious. The salad itself was a tiny serving, but it was loaded with cheese, tomato, cucumber and herbs, and it was pretty filling.   Of course, once we were done, we decided that our meal would be incomplete without a Pizookie. They had a couple new flavors out, and we decided on the salted caramel version. What can I say...I'm a sucker for salted caramel anything!   When they brought it to us, I thought, ""Well, that's the saddest looking Pizookie I've seen yet."" The tower of ice cream had already melted into the cookie, so it wasn't as grand and tall as it usually is. But, that didn't mean that it wasn't delicious. Boy, howdy, was it yummy!   All in all, it was another good night of good, cheap food from a chain we're coming to enjoy. The only downer was the well-done calamari.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=200,3.08,3.22,3.22,3.152,3.1640000000000006

However, this location made me feel like I should've went to Lazy Dog instead..  I was in the mood for something small and light so I looked at their happy hour deals and none of it really stood out to me, which made me think I really should've went down the street to Lazy Dog instead. Nonetheless, we ordered the California(?) flatbread, I can't recall the name, but it had chunks of tomatoes, avocados and grilled chicken with a tangy white sauce, and the Tuscan Chicken Limone pasta dish. It took about 15 mins for this tiny dish to come and the restaurant wasn't even busy at all. I noticed our server was walking extremely slow to our table like he was just taking a nice walk in the park. Thank goodness the food made up for it because the flatbread was delicious! The ingredients all seemed very fresh without being too heavy.  The pasta dish finally came and that's when we realized they never gave us our utensils or napkins. We flagged down a waiter and that's when the girl who was originally our waitress came by and dropped off our utensils without even apologizing and didn't bother to look at us. I'm not sure whether they didn't pay attention to us as much just because we only ordered two dishes or their service is just straight up crappy, but hey, what can you expect from big chain restaurants right? And even after she dropped it off, we realized the napkin was completely filthy and had to exchange for another one.  The pasta dish was okay, nothing really stood out to me. It had two pieces of toasted bread, angel hair pasta, two thick pieces of chicken, canned artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had a good taste to it and the sauce was cheesy yet light. The canned artichoke hearts balanced out the flavors with a hint of acidity. Pasta was okay, but a bit overcooked. I usually soak my bread into the sauce but there was barely any sauce and the bread was too crunchy to the point where it was hurting my mouth.

My husband and I met with 11 other friends as we waited for 1 1/2 hours, even thought we made a reservation. (why makes us make a reservation)???. I did not hear any grumblings from my guests about the wait.... because we were talking about 1. Once upon a time 2. Star Wars  3. Comic Con Past 4. FOOD and then finally the little UFO blinked and WE finally got a table ordered.  Some people got appetizers, some people got an entrée.  I felt bad for one of my good friends because she ordered a burger and she was the last one to receive her food-- even the steaks got to us before the burger. Tracy had mention that the waitress had assured her it was coming and that she was not forgotten. Tracey is pretty easy-going and happy, she mentioned that the was a nice gesture the waitress had done.  I ordered the ribeye with Asparagus and White Cheddar Mash, the whole plate tasted like someone salted it to death. When my friend tasted a piece, she stated that it was salty, but that she liked it.  And... I know that they ask is the steak to your liking... it's a CYA thing. But i cut the very edge of the steak... that part was good. So I tried to scrap off the salt and then eat what I could.  Now the two stars were saved by the waitress and the manager who cut my cake beautifully. For a party of 13, the waitress was very attentive. Now I repeat because I was concerned the my b-day cake would become a Mexican Chocolate Slaughter, however that manager did such a great job. KUDOS to you. We had separate checks so the closing was pretty simple and fast.  *****Tips They have the option to reserve a table-- but beware you're whole party has to be there.  Make sure you taste a couple of pieces of your steak, before the server walks away. They allow cakes from outside of special events. ***This note is an update 06.27.2014 to Trevor something rather he may work or may not work here, or maybe he has a significant other who works here.  I don't know or care. Next time you send a compliment please do not curse at me or put innocent people down. That was really rude, and your curse words are not welcomed in my comments.

I have to say that this BJ's is the worst BJ's food wise in the chain. We tried them about 2 months after the opened as we were excited one of our favorite restaurants had opened close to where we now live. Unfortunately the food was sub par at best, it was like someone who had never been trained to cook had been thrown a recipe book and simply did their best. The service was ok nothing to rave about. So we left feeling a little bummed that our Experience paled in comparison to our Reno BJ experiences. Anyway we decided that we would wait and went a 2nd time because we thought maybe it was opening issues and we wanted to know if it had improved we wanted it to be improved so bad! Unfortunately the 2nd time  i can easily say that the food was worse. My wife enjoyed her taco's but the steak i ordered was burnt our stuffed mushrooms was so embarrassing i call the manager over and he was horribly embarrassed. It seems they have a very lazy kitchen. Some one in their isn't doing a very good job. We will try it a again in a few months just because we know BJ's typically are good value.

At 10:30, I got up out of my seat to track down the server to ask if he could get the rest of my table some water and to check the status of my bloody marys.  By 10:45, no waters, bloody marys, or food! There was a large party across from us who although had their drink order still had not gotten any food......they walked out without paying.  We waited 10 more minutes and the manager finally came over at my request.  She said they were short staffed, she was helping out the bar, running around and that she was doing it all on a broken toe. She also added that they didn't expect such a large crowd.  Really??  On the FIRST home game of the NFL football season against the defending superbowl CHAMPIONS????

Our service (Manuel was our server) was the worst I've experienced in at least 6 months to a year, and I dine out just about every day. We chose the self-seating on the outside patio and it didn't take long for our server to approach. We ordered waters and an appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) and he left. It wasn't until we were half way done with our appetizer that he came back to take the remainder of our order. We ordered the mushrooms appetizer, the bacon corn fritters, and a small 11"" hand-tossed pepperoni extreme pizza. My beer came out about 7-10 minutes later, and our food came out another 5-7 minutes after that. Not horrible but not that quick. Our food was dropped off by a food runner, not our server, who we didn't see for another 15 minutes or so. After a few bites I realized I was given a 9"" deep dish, not the hand-tossed 11"". I asked a random server walking by and she confirmed I was given the deep dish and would get my server. When he came over I told him what had happened, and I said at this point I didn't want to wait for another pizza to be cooked so just charge me for what I ordered and I'll eat what was in front of me. He half-heartedly acknowledged the mistake and told me he'd check the menu for prices and let me know how he'd resolve the issue. Meanwhile we were thirsty as our waters weren't refilled once during this unnecessarily extended meal. When he came back he started reciting prices for ""shareable pizzas"" until I reminded him again that I ordered the 11"" hand-tossed, so to just charge me whatever that would have cost. Fast-forward 15-20 minutes and we're way past done eating and can't get his attention (he seems to be ignoring us at this point). I showed him a rewards coupon I had for a pizookie and ordered that and asked for the check as well. A food runner brought the pizookie and he eventually brought the check, then took another 5-7 minutes to pick it up. I still tipped 15% because I don't have it in me to tip less, knowing I'm taking from what the cooks, expos, bussers, etc. are getting from that, but I wish I could have tipped them directly. Left me regretting that restaurant decision. I had specifically gone to BJ's for the handtossed pizza. They also didn't clear a single plate (appetizers, side plates, etc. until we were leaving). The only defense I'll provide on our server's behalf was he appeared to have been seated several tables at once when we first sat down, but he did appear to receive backup in the form of 2-3 additional servers within 5 minutes of the mass seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=640,3.36,3.19,3.19,2.3120000000000003,3.258

379,Jennifer V.,"San Diego, CA",126,152,152.0,1.0,2014-12-01,"I try to be fair with my reviews so I've been holding off on writing this update in hopes that things would change here, but after getting food poisoning from this location, I just can't hold back any longer.  I've been to BJ's more than a handful of times in the past few months to sit at the bar for football games. The bar is usually pretty full, but not more than any other restaurant I've been to on a busy day. The service is ALWAYS incredibly slow but typically, I don't care that much if there's a good game on. For a while, I thought that maybe they were just having a difficult time handling football season, but I started to look around and notice employees standing around, talking to each other, and doing a whole lot of nothing.  On Saturday, I went with some friends and my boyfriend to BJ's to watch the Apple Cup. Initially, we were sitting outside but decided we wanted to move inside where it was a bit warmer. We were told the game would be played outside so we didn't want to move inside unless the game would also be played inside. I grabbed a table and asked the first server that walked by if the Apple Cup would be on one of the TV's. He said that he would find out for me so I waited there patiently. He disappeared for a few minutes and came back into the bar and started serving his tables again, as I sat there waiting on if I should tell my party to come inside or not. Finally after waiting awhile, a waitress comes up to serve me. I told her I asked one of the waiters if they would play the game and that he never came back. She confirmed that it wouldn't be a problem.  Once we finally sat down, it took a LONG time to get our first round of drinks. By the time we wanted to order food, I couldn't find our waitress anywhere. As we waited, I made eye contact with several employees that walked by, as well as those who were standing around talking. They simply looked over and looked away quickly. Finally, I saw our waitress and had to flag her down since she wasn't even planning on stopping by. My boyfriend and I ordered sliders for an appetizer and BBQ chicken pizza for dinner, with a side of ranch for myself. My friend ordered pizza with a side of ranch as well, while her husband ordered lasagna. The food was okay, or so I thought. Before I get into that, I have to mention that by the time the Apple Cup was about to come on, our waitress told us she could not play it after she had promised they would. We called a manager over and luckily he said he would turn the game on for us. Well, the game had already started and we were still waiting for the channel to change. I looked around at several employees that ignored me again so I went up to one of the hostesses and asked for help. Finally, the game was turned on.  About 3 to 4 hours after eating, I started to feel nauseous. I know most people have their own idea of when food poisoning occurs, but if you take a look at the FDA's website for food poisoning, you'll learn that there isn't just one generic timeline of when it occurs after you've ingested contaminated food. For example, the website notes that foods such as egg salads and creamy foods can cause food poisoning symptoms such as sudden onset of severe nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. The symptoms may be present within 1-6 hours and last for 24-48 hours.  It really depends on the type of food and bacteria ingested.  With that being said, my friend and I were up throughout the entire night with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and fever. My boyfriend and her husband were fine, so we narrowed the problem down to the ranch dressing we both ate. We did not eat any of the same foods the day(s) before so it would be too big of a coincidence that we were both up all night long with the same symptoms. She was vomiting blood at one point and her parents almost took her to the emergency room. I was considering going too as I lost track of how many times I had vomited, but figured I wouldn't since my boyfriend wasn't sick. I didn't know till the following day that my friend had food poisoning as well. We were both sick all day on Sunday and could barely eat a thing. Today, I still feel as if I got kicked in the stomach, but I'm a lot better than I was yesterday.  I called BJ's and notified them so other people don't suffer. They apologized and told me that I would be contacted soon by corporate. The manager I spoke with suggested that ""there's been something going around lately"" as if we can't tell the difference between obvious food poisoning and the flu. I wasted the last day of my Thanksgiving vacation being sick because of someone else's carelessness. Mistakes happen but like I said before, the staff here overall just doesn't seem to have their act together and I don't plan on eating here again since I can't trust that the food is managed properly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=440,3.28,3.21,3.21,2.34,3.238

This location was much bigger since it's a stand alone and had many more TV screens for the sports enthusiast. We came after the Chargers Broncos game so there were a lot of Broncos fans relishing in their victory while watching the SNF game. I liked the elevated seats they had since it really gives you a grand view of the entire restaurant. The service was a bit slow, but I can understand since they were packed after the football game. It irked me that it took 20 mins for a waiter to come to us and ask for orders. The waiter seemed like a college student so he didn't have that waiter-ish personality. We didn't get offered water until we asked for some after getting our cocktails. There were times when I tried to flag down other waiters for service, but they seemed like chickens with their heads cut off since everyone was running around. They wouldn't make eye contact with you if you yelled to get their attention so they can move past you asap. I do commend them on offering a complimentary pizookie since it was my gf's birthday month. The pizzokie was delicious, as always. As for the cocktails, we go the Strawberry Splash and I got the Peach Sangria. The SS was very sweet, but apparently has grey goose. The peach sangria was tasteful with a hint of wine as an after taste. For entrees, we got a White Pie and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. A tid bit to everyone when they say ""white pie"", they don't actually leave out the marinara. They put marinara on the pizza and drizzle alfredo sauce over the pie. We were a bit disappointed since white pie always meant alfredo sauce sans marinara. The parm chicken was delicious and I could always come back for more.

Now, I know what the ahi poke appetizer looks like because I always get it whenever I go to BJ's and it always looks so good and there's always plenty on the the plate (sometimes I can't even finish it because there's too much) but wow, it looked like they just threw shit in a to-go box because it was late.  I mean, don't get me wrong... I get that it was around 10PM when they left but really?  I was so upset because I couldn't do anything about it because she had already paid and left. The $14 bill was definitely not worth it.

For starters it took a while to get our order taken but when we did I ordered the house top sirloin, now I really like my steak well done. When I got my steak I was asked if I would like some A1 steak sauce and I said yes. Well it never came, so after waiting and with no one passing by we decided to just eat. When I cut into my steak it was pink. So when I mentioned this to the waitress all I got was I am sorry. I then asked what happened to the A1 sauce and she chuckled and said oh I'm sorry again. On my bill there was no discount offered. The only good thing that came out of this night was that the Chargers won their game.

Such a long table haha. Anyways, the food was already pre-ordered, which was about 6 pizzas, and I was impressed with how fresh everything was. I had about 4 slices of pizza with flavors such as chicken & artichoke or pepperoni & sausage. After the pizzas, we had 3 party platter pazookies, which was basically devoured after 5 minutes. For my side of the table's pazookie, we had salted caramel, cookies & creme, triple chocolate, and macadamia nut. Triple chocolate was definitely the sweetest, but all flavors tasted astounding together.  Service-wise, I am really impressed with the 2 waitresses we had.

The bus boy returned, finished wiping that table and said he was going to get us a manager, which he did.   The manager came over..apologized for the overlook and asked if we knew what we wanted to which we responded that we didn't know..We had no menus, no napkins, nothing.  He brought some over shortly.  We still had no text for a table so when he came back with the menus we saw that a table was being cleared in the patio area and would just take that table instead.  He seemed displeased or annoyed but followed us over and handed us the menus and left with our drink order. Shortly after a guy shows us and said he is going to be our server..We review the menu and place our orders..still no drinks, no water, nothing.. 20 min later or drinks arrive, a couple of min after our food.  I ordered fish and chips..My friend a burger and fries.  He dumps the food off and disappears.  The fish was so fried that it looked like they refried some fish they had laying around..hopefully not leftovers from another plate.  It was very dark brown..pretty much charred to the point of the fish inside dissolving.

I felt like I could lounge there all day and no one would care. Who has time for that, though? lol The seating could have the promise of being a little crowded if it had been busier but while i was there, it was busy but without the claustrophobic feeling of too many bodies in one area. I had the Chicken Pesto sandwich (I know, super simple) but it was extremely delicious! We also had the Avocado rolls which were amazing, as well.

The appetizer of avocado egg rolls, despite having fresh avocado, fell along the same lines. Something was off but I couldn't place my finger on it. The next time I went was after a Charger's game and decided to skip the pizza, ordering a chicken sandwich. Yet again, I got a lack of flavor and the chicken seemed kind of rubbery. The saving grace of the meal was the Pizookie, a fresh baked-to-order cookie that is topped with ice cream. It's super indulgent and easily their best offering. The PIzookie was tasty but what made the entrees so lifeless and boring? I finally learned the truth while mentioning my experiences to a friend that used to work at one. Nearly everything is FROZEN and reheated. Where some chain restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory may be gluttonous but prepare everything fresh, BJ's pulls everything out of a bag and sticks most in a microwave.

As the saying goes, but I ignored the cliche to give this place a second chance and paid the price The first time was pretty innocent. Undercooked lasagna that had to be sent back. I was done before my wife got her remade lasagna. No offer of 'on the house', or even a free dessert. Ok. The second time in May 2015 it was a disaster. I ordered the salmon and when it came out, it was raw in the middle. I asked to please cook longer, and the waitress took it away. Came back 10 mins later, and it was hardly any better. Salmon should be a nice pink throughout, and the inside on this was still cold to the touch, and rubbery like sushi.  I asked for a manager, and asked, ""Is it me or is this still undercooked?"" She agreed, apologized, and took it away. My wife had finished her meal and my stomach rumbled. When it came a third time it was broken into pieces, and crispy all around the outside. I said its fine, I was starving. Manager said the Salmon was on the house. Wife's meal and drinks would be charged though. I thought at least the drinks as well should have been comp'd. The final thing came when paying the bill. It was $49.27 and I gave a $60 bill. The waitress brought it back with just a $10 bill inside. No coins? Really? She just turned her back and walked away like we were the most insulting table she'd ever served.  I left the $10 as tip, and almost started to go back and oping out she was short on the change, but my wife and voice of reason just said, ""Don't do it, we're just not coming  back"".

We ordered three orders of happy hour sized wings and potstickers as well as a Jeremiah Red and Double Berry. While the drinks came at a normal pace, the food came out a little slower than it should have considering the small amount of people in the restaurant. However, when the food finally did arrive, everything was cooked satisfactorily. I was bit disappointed that the server didn't come around very often.

ATMOSPHERE: Open seating around the upper bar area and patio instead of waiting on the guest list for a table in the lower dining area.  Plus there are plenty of TVs in the open seating areas if you are a sports fan. FOOD: On a hot day, order the Watermelon and Feta Salad!  With the sweetness of the watermelon and the saltiness of the feta cheese, this unique pairing compliments each other so well!  So refreshingly delicious, I wouldn't mind eating 3-4 servings of this salad! Deep dish pizza here is legit.  I'm not a deep dish pizza fan because there is too much crust and bread involved, but BJ's version made me actually like theirs.  The crust is golden and crisp, and the bread base is fluffy and light.  I ordered the Gourmet Five Meat pizza (mini size) because I'm a meat lover pizza kind of gal.  The mini portion will feed 1-2 people.  My friend and I ate two slices each and were getting pretty full. Have a small appetite?  Try the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms filled with BJ's spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs, drizzled with a zesty lemon pesto sauce.  Nice little bites to snack on. SERVICE: Our server, Jennifer H, was super nice and friendly.  She had given us her personal experience on the food we selected when she was taking our order. She lett us know we are in for a wonderful treat.  And... she was right!  The food was very tasty!  She also came by frequently to make sure if we needed anything, checked on our food order (when we were waiting) and refilled our drinks.  She provided excellent service.  Thank you, my fellow Jen! CONS: 1.) The menu is like a novel.  A heavy book with so many pages of food and drink choices.  It was overwhelming trying to figure out what to eat (pizza, sandwich, burger, pasta, specialty entrees, salads, and the list going on forever it seems).  My friend had to take a few minutes to really figure out what we were hungry for. 2.) It took a bit of time to receive our food and drinks.  Probably because the kitchen has so many different kinds of food to make for their customers.  However, our server Jen was awesome proactively checking up on our order periodically without us having to ask.

Sometimes 10 minutes go by before drink orders are taken and most times food takes 30-40 minutes.  The food, is another issue. The stuffed mushrooms and calamari are better choices as they are not as greasy as the rest of the appetizer choices. However, the last visit, the calamari was burnt. The main entrees, from house salads to enlightened choices, to pizza, or whatever your choice may be, comes out consistently inconsistent. Sometimes undercooked, sometimes burnt, sometimes so salty that even after scrapping a layer of seasoning off of your grilled chicken dishes ( yes, a layer of seasoning actually peels off the chicken) you are left trying to find something to combat the saltiness.  To be fair, we have not tried desert, but the reviews on that seem to be consistent with what we have experienced. In the end, it is a great place to find decent beers, but don't go there hungry for good food. You may find yourself waiting only to be marginally satisfied with mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=340,2.96,3.34,3.212,2.6600000000000006,3.188

I (luckily) decided to walk in to the bar upon my arrival and open a tab versus ordering from the two servers dedicated to our group. I saw a lot of people either waiting for long periods to get their drinks, or, the server completely forgot to bring their drink. Aside from that, said servers were pleasant. I would just walk to the bar each time I wanted another drink and my excellent bartender, Brittany H, would get my order right away and I was quickly back to my group with a fresh, cold beer, while my friends had to wait for theirs. The only tricky thing was actually walking on the restaurant floor. It was super slippery (and I was wearing new sneakers). I asked someone from my group who also inside as I ice-skated quickly and shakily past them, ""Is it just me or is this floor slippery?"" He said, ""Not just you. It is!"" Luckily I have good balance but I thought someone is going to slip and fall. Not good. But the place was fine other than the above.

We ended up sitting outside, all squished together, cause the table sat 6 and there where 8 of us.  Anyways we got the deal where it came with an appetizer (salad or soup), medium deep dish pizza and pizookie for $25.  So I got the Caesar salad, worst salad ever. There where barely any dressing and the romaine was soggy, not fresh. And my boyfriend got the broccoli and cheddar soup, it was super salty because they dump a lot of cheddar cheese on top of the thick soup.  Now for the deep dish pizza, we order mushroom and pepperoni which took forever for them to be done with because they made pepperoni and sausage instead. But we weren't told that they had messed up on our pizza and had started all over till 10 mins after our friends had gotten their deep dish. So by the time we got our pizza everyone had finished eating. Didn't enjoy the pizz because the crust was super soggy and super bland.  For the pizookie we got the cookies and cream. It was yummy. It had a brownie at the bottom with vanilla ice cream on top.  Also we tried their calamari, was not impress. It was super dry and brunt. And the mozzarella stickers where good. Perfectly fried. And super cheesy.  Service here could use some improvement. Drinks too forever to get refill. Whenever we needed something there where no waiter/waitress to be seen.

I came in this past weekend to eat brunch, and it took about 25 minutes for a server to come to our table to greet us, and when she did, she acted like it was completely normal and that we were wrong to have asked for a server to come over. Once she asked for our drink order, we both ordered coffee, and she explained to us in a very short rude manner that the coffee machine was broken. Finding that a bit odd that a huge restaurant has one coffee machine, we just stuck with water and kept our mouths shut. We proceeded to order because after waiting 25 minutes for a server, we were hungry! After she took our order, her attitude was extremely fake and nauseating to the point where I was nervous about our food being tampered with.  We waited about 40 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, they had forgot an entire portion of my entree in the back and had to bring it out later. The food was mediocre at best.

We were seated by a hostess .After about 6 minutes passes the  the manager who seemed a little angry about something or another approached our table. No smiles no greeting. He Began to ask what we wanted to eat. We said we would like drinks first then we will order. He took our drink order walked away and never got our drinks. We know he never told the server because we watched him walk away and he or the server never came back. We were sitting there for another 15 minutes or so and no server and no drinks and no nothing. In fact the server female server with the large arm tattoo walked right by us, looked at us and kept going. HuH? The place was only half filled. Well after seeing we were never to be served we decided to leave. I seen the guy that asked for our drink order and asked him whats up? Why were we not served? He said angrily "" Have a good day""! and pointed to the front door where my wife was already at waiting for me. I asked for the manager at the front desk and this is where we discovered that this angry big guy coming right for us WAS the manager! I would describe this guy as a big angry bully by the way his mean ways were put upon us.  We are both senior citizens. Why would this so called manager treat good customers like this? Why would BJ's hire such a disrespectful angry man. This guy was bout 6 inches right on top of me with his hand pointing at the door telling us seniors to ""Have a GOOD DAY!

76,Calvin N. H.,"San Diego, CA",722,300,1910.0,3.0,2015-10-15,"I've been to various BJ's on many occasions. I've frequented this particular location a handful of times. Parking can be a pain depending on when you go. During peak hours on weekends, expect a long wait. There's a Barnes and Noble nearby to kill time if the wait is excessively long. One person will likely have to take one for the team and wait at BJ's in case your table is ready. This location is pretty spacious with indoor and outdoor dining options. They have big screen televisions so you can catch sports action. Food is generally pretty good. I'd rate it 4/5. I've tried pasta, entrees, burgers, pizzas, salads, appetizers, and dessert. Service can be hit or miss... pretty inconsistent. I've had anywhere from 2-4 stars out of 5 in service. I've noticed larger parties get better overall service. This makes sense because their ticket will come out to a larger dollar amount (versus a table for 2-3) and this correlates to the tip. For this reason, there have been times water and drinks haven't been refilled, it's taken forever to get boxes, utensils, the bill and so on. But I look over at the bigger table and the server is all up on that table like Barney Stinson on a hot blonde. I get it, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. There are plenty of places I've frequented where customer service is much more consistent and I don't see favoritism because of group size. Atmosphere is okay, pretty standard. This place is clean, spacious, and has plenty of televisions. I'd score it a 3 out of 5. My last few visits, service hasn't been good. As a result, I can only rate this place a 3... food is the only reason this score isn't lower.

After that it was pretty much a waiting game to see if she was going to help us or drop off any requests that we had. She wasn't really nice she never apologized once about anything and basically seemed like she didn't want to help us. She never came by to ask if we were doing okay or if we needed anything as we watched her serve all her other tables with smile. It almost seemed like there was something about us she didn't like.

Our team was James and Casey who work together on the patio to make sure everyone is taken care of; James was our main Brewmaster.  I pretty much pinged him for suggestions on everything I ordered, from food to beer and his recommendations were spot on.    Food: I ordered garlic wings for an appetizer, the new Portobello Swiss Burger (from loaded burgers section) substitute Bison meat, the thin cut fries, a side of Broccoli Cheddar soup in a bread bowl, and BJ's in house Black and Tan (can't remember the exact name of it).  First off, the 5 appetizer wings blew the skin off any of the wings I've had at a certain restaurant that specializes in wings; I won't mention any names BWW...The Portobello Swiss burger was so delicious, it's like the chef was reading my mind as far as how I wanted it cooked; pink in the middle, excellent.  I highly recommend substituting the beef for the bison. The fries were acceptable as fries go, warm enough not to burn my mouth when they arrived.  If you order soup, make sure to get it in their toasted, garlic butter slathered bread bowl; eat the soup, then the bowl!  A two-for!  Then there was the beer, so many to choose from I couldn't decide, so I went with their in-house black and tan since it's been a while and I was pleasantly surprised with it's goodness; I'd definitely have it again.   My wife ordered the Spicy Hawaiian Chicken pizza and she said it was delicious, tons of flavor, and enough left over for a meal the next day. At the end of our meal James brought us a ice cream covered chocolate chip cookie with a couple of candles in it and the very nice manager took our photo.  Totally unexpected and very much appreciated.  Topped off our dining experience nicely.   Again, the service was exceptional and we're definitely going back.  Don't let the bad reviews steer you away, they deserve your business.  Thanks again James and Casey!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=420,3.2,3.39,3.232,2.9000000000000004,3.314

After eating a dry pizza I received my bill to find no discount on my mushrooms. I brought it to the bartenders attention and she went to check only to return saying oh no it's not on this appetizer.

Come to realize he was basically ignoring all of his tables to spend more time at a table full of females. He never once showed his face the whole time I spent eating my food. Never asked us how our food was and then when we asked for two boxes he only showed up back to the table with one for the pizza and then gave a look of disgust when we asked for a second box for my friends wife's food. I don't even know his name because that's how poor of service it was. The only distinguishing thing about him from all the other servers was his beard.

My mini pizookie was free for my birthday which was nice, they refused to sing, but I was mostly joking when I asked. It wouldn't be my first choice for going out for dinner, but for every once in awhile its a fun spot. My primary complaint is their avocado eggrolls have a spicy mayo like substance and its overpowering! Its like they cover up the fact that there is little to no avocado in them by putting so much spicy stuff in them I cant taste anything else!

293,Jennifer C.,"San Diego, CA",78,12,12.0,1.0,2016-01-15,"It pains me to leave this review because I do enjoy coming to this restaurant.  However, I have not been here in a while and had a terrible experience today at lunch. I called in a take out order.  I ordered the lunch special with a classic baked potato, add bacon and cheese and a tomato and mozzarella salad.  I went to pick up my lunch and it was ready when I got there. I looked at the baked potato and noticed it was missing butter, sour cream, and chives. All items the classic baked potato comes with. I decided not to make a big deal out of it and just told the server that it looked like the sour cream was missing. His response was, oh you wanted sour cream. I really wanted to tell him that it comes with what I ordered, but I didn't want to have to educate him on a menu item that he should know. I again, let this slide.  Next it came to paying for my lunch he told me the total and automatically I knew it was wrong. There is no way the lunch combo is $11+.  I believe it is 7.25, but then I did add bacon and extra cheese to the baked potato so I imagined it increased the price, but didn't know how much. After I paid the server handed me my bag, but did not give me the receipt. I had to ask for it. As I was walking out I noticed I was rang up for a baked potato meal add cheese and bacon. It was odd to me that I was able to get the correct order, meaning I also got the salad, but yet the way it was listed on the receipt was incorrect. I went to my car to make sure to look up the menu online and sure enough it was wrong.  I went back into the restaurant and advised the server that was helping me that I think my meal was rung up incorrectly. He looked at the receipt and then said oh it looks like my manager entered this in incorrectly (ZERO accountability), let me go get him, I will be right back. I was leaning up again the wall with my back to the kitchen on my phone. A few minutes later I hear a ""hi my name is _____(I forget what the guys name was, I think it was Paul or Mark or something)"". I didn't turn around because I had no idea he was talking to me. Then he repeats himself, this time with a slightly ruder tone.  The first tone wasn't pleasant to begin with. He said you wanted to speak to me. I said, no, I told this gentleman that I thought my order was entered in incorrectly and I overpaid for my meal. He looks at the receipt and said oh, well you can jut give her the difference. He said, yeah it looks like he (ZERO Accountability again) rang it in incorrectly.  The server then gives the difference back and I went about my way, but with a slightly jaded perspective of this restaurant. A. How did I receive the correct order (kind of), but yet pay for a different meal? B.  Was my meal entered incorrectly because the server was then going to go back in and change the order and take the difference as a tip, or was who ever who rang me in just that lazy and incompetent? C. The manager was an ASS! You can tell he had a bit of a chip on his shoulder. I am not sure if he is a new manager or just the day time manager because I have gone to this restaurant in the evening and have had nothing but nice things to say about all the staff. I wish I could blame his rudeness on the rush hour lunch, but it was 2 o'clock and the restaurant was not busy at all. In fact when I walked in the first time i had two servers look at me and not help me and then when I came back due to the overcharging there were two other servers at the take out station again just standing there, not helping.

We weren't going to be annoying about it and it wasn't a big deal, but those lemon pepper dry rub wings were so good that we wish we had that last wing.  We shared the bacon-guacamole deluxe burger and it was good. The downfall was that there was no smoked bacon really. Rather than crispy pieces of bacon like in other burgers, there were minimal microscopic pieces mixed in with the guacamole. The thin cut fries were amazing, though.

I've been a regular at the BJs in my hometown of Burbank and have had generally good experiences but this one really left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). Here is what went wrong: 1. Parking sucks, its a big shopping center with a lot of business. While there is a good number of parking spots, its a quite a walk for a (unusually) cold, rainy San Diego night. 2. When we got there, the hostess told us it was 20 minute wait OR we could sit outside or cocktail area. They DID not tell us the outside area has no umbrellas or anything to shield us from the rain. Why would they even have they area open? We sat there for 15 minutes ordered food and drinks but the misty rain took a toll. Finally I gave up and found the manager who promptly seated us but they didn't bother bringing us new salads or drinks. When the food came it was subpar and my steak had absolutely no flavor.

Parking spaces are small, even if you have a compact car. Spots near the entrance of the building are always taken too. If you're here during dinner time, you're going to have to park a little further away unless you get lucky and someone pulls out of their spot right when you're pulling up. Still, ambience in here is very nice. Lighting is a little dim, but the only time that affects anything is when i'm trying to take a picture of my food haha Hostesses have always been pleasant and even during busy times, they'll get to your table as fast as they can. This last time I visited, they had the option for you to leave your number and they'd text you when a booth/table was available if you wanted to sit and have a drink at the bar while you waited. Very cool! Waitresses the last couple times have been knowledgeable of their menu and never forgot to come back for refills or to bring extra ranch (yes, i'm one of those people lol). My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the artichoke spinach dip. So good haha. As far as entree's go, I'm usually a pizza guy. I remember their pizza being VERY good before, HOWEVER, the last two times I've gone, the crust seemed a little more dry than usual. As in not enough sauce on the pizza to soak into the deep dish. Topping and cheese were delicious though. I'm a big pizza fan and theirs was one of my favorites so I might give it another try before I call it quits. Maybe even request a little extra sauce next time too. Ahi Poke salad is good as well. Give that a try! Overall, aside from the parking, my experiences have always been pleasant here. Good size menu and quality of food is better than at others like applebees and TGI Fridays.

I've come here twice in the last few weeks and did not have a good experience either time.  The first time I came was around 10pm on a Sunday night. My friend and I decided to sit in the bar area to take advantage of the late night happy hour specials. The server took awhile to bring menus and when she did she plopped them in front of us and walked away, no greeting, smile, or anything. When she FINALLY came back to take our order we had some questions as it wasn't clear what the happy hour specials were. Her response ""look somewhere in that smaller menu they are in there somewhere"" and walked away. We finally placed our orders. We both ordered pizza. It took 45 minutes for us to get our food, and the place was not busy. Once the pizza was delivered no one ever came back to check on us. We had to flag servers down to ask for the box and check. The pizza was good, but the service was horrible. I decided to give this place a try again since I remember BJ's being better than that. Second time around I came on a Sunday afternoon. Decided to sit at the bar area again to watch the bball game. This time the service was ok, but the food was terrible! I ordered a steak cooked to medium. When the steak arrived it was burnt crisp and was so rubbery I could barely cut it open. I said something to the server so he said he would have another steak brought out.

For drinks, us ladies got the pear cider and the guys both got the snake bite. Pear cider was crisp and bubbly. It tasted the most similar to the pear cider I had at a farmers market back in NY, just more bubbly. The snake bite had a creamy taste with a sweet aftertaste as it also contains pear cider in it according to my boyfriend; to me however it still tasted bitter because of the stout.

The food is standard bar food.  Neither amazing or horrible.  We had the pizza and wings but I've been there before for other menu items.  It's a nice place to sit and socialize while having a beer and some food but there are other places that are better if you're looking for a memorable meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=180,2.52,2.89,3.148,2.732,2.742

Been here over 10 times frequently to the point their employees even recognize me by face, and I always gave generous tips; yet, their service never got better and I can truly say it sucks. The waiter takes 30mins to communicate with you when you arrive. Specifically, the night crew are very unfriendly and they do not understand what customer service mean. They will take forever to bring out your food to the point that the food comes out cold and needs to be heated. You are lucky if you get 1 refill of your drink. I will never recommend anyone to go to this BJ location. Horrible service! Chula Vista location doesn't have this problem. Please fix your issues!!!!

However, this restaurant is still very nice and resembles all the other ones. The ambiance is loud but lively and dim inside.  FOOD: The food is good too, kinda reminds me of a higher-end TGI Fridays. Don't expect the ahi poke ($12) to be traditional poke, it's drenched in soy sauce. The pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut since it was really doughy, but silly good. The chicken Alfredo ($16) is delicious!! But the chicken was dry.  SERVICE: Our waiter was very upbeat and friendly, but they do get pretty busy and forget to come around to check up on you from time to time. I'm not sure if it was because we came late at night, but three of the servers (including ours) were hanging out in the back tables gossiping/talking with their friend...

Instead of asking if it came back to my liking, she handed me the bill. Even though my pizookie was obviously not being eaten.

I never ask for a manager but this time it was required. I walked to the front asked for a manager. She came to our table, we explained to her what was going on and she said she'd fix it. We asked her for refills and she came back with 2 of the 3 that we needed. She did give us a free pizzooka but failed to bring us the third refill.

225,Art C.,"San Diego, CA",77,48,12.0,3.0,2016-11-09,"I've eaten at BJ's all over the country and this review will be a culmination of those visits. If you've been to one of them, you've been to all of them. I will be highlighting this location since it was the latest BJ's I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Location: BJ's is located off of Frazee Road near Barnes and Nobles. I've come here during lunch and dinner and each time wasn't too busy. Plenty of tables both inside and outdoors. A lot of bar space as well if you want to watch the games or enjoy happy hour. You shouldn't have a problem with parking either. 8/10 Service: The service has always been spot on at this location. Our server (whoever it may be) was very helpful and had impeccable timing when we needed something. The food always came out within 15-20 minutes and the drinks came quicker than you can say ""LETS GO LAKERS"". Some of the best service I've experienced at a chain restaurant. 9/10 Happy hour: This is usually when I come here. Their happy hour runs from 3p-7p Monday- Friday and 10p- close Sunday- Thursday. Half off mini pizzas, dollar off your beer, and 2 bucks off appetizers. Not bad for a HH but then again, whose gonna say no to BOGO mini pizzas? 7/10 Food: The menu at BJ's covers anything you would want. They are known for their pizza but they also have plenty of other choices you can pick from. The last time I came here I ordered a Classic Cheeseburger w/ french fries and an order of the fried calamari. The burger wasn't anything special but I keep my tastes simple when I drink beer. The calamari was ok. The breading flakes off and there are only a few big pieces of squid. Again tho, simple tastes when I partake in the game of drink. 6/10 Drinks: BJ's is well known for their craft beer. I have enjoyed their Jeremiah Red for as long as I been drinking. It's an Irish style ale with a refreshing, fruity bite. I used to get pitchers of this beer... ahhh the good old days. They also offer their version of a hefeweizen which will quench your thirst. 8/10 This restaurant got 3/5 stars from me because there simply isn't anything ""special"" about BJ's. Yes they have great craft beer and decent food but nothing on the menu leaves me craving more of it. Overall, good place to watch a game and have a few dollar-off-beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=120,3.16,2.94,3.116,2.732,3.0280000000000005

It takes for ever for a server to come up to you & take your order & I asked a couple if anybody was sitting at the table next to them cause there were beer glasses all over & they said no so I sat down. It took at least 6-8 minutes for a server to come up to me & I had to ask for the glasses to be cleared & the table was dirty & he brought my drink back but never wiped the table which was disgusting so I asked for the table to be wiped & he gave me attitude. The couple that was sitting next to me said there table was never wiped either, they just moved over the glasses & put them on a different table cause there was no service. That is wrong that customers should have to ask for  common sense tasks to be done by the waiters. That is disrespectful & they need to more aware of when tables are dirty & need to clear off the dirty dishes before customers sit down. While I was there, there were at least 3 other couples that had to wait for service on cleaning tables.

For appetizers, the stuffed mushrooms are our go-to. They are delectable, drizzled with a green herb garlic sauce. The traditional bone-in wings are light and crispy served for 2.

All the waiter and waitresses here were very prompt and knowledgeable on the menu. They still have a happy hour during the NFL games which comes in handy if you want happy hour prices. I am really sad over the years that they reduced the level of their happy hours. They have a daily special thing going on now which makes $4 dollar draft days on Wednesday. The place is clean and the bathrooms are pretty nice too. They have screens set up at the bar. Nothing like a buffalo wild wings scale but not bad. Last time I been here, I got my usual of the Jeremiah red ale which is my go-to beer here. It's sweet yet has a good kick at the same time. I had some spaghetti and meatballs which I shared with my wife and they split it for me. I was definitely a happy camper over that.

275,Russ U.,"San Jacinto, CA",342,20,19.0,1.0,2017-01-16,"Wow where do I even start. We went to San Diego for an evening of getting out of town and having some fun; approx 90 min drive away.  This was our 1st stop to get some dinner and meet up with friends.  We arrived and found easy parking and did what alot of people do after a long drive.  It was approx 9pm and the men's room was just downright gross.  Informed hostess when we checked in. We were seated pretty promptly, so they were good there. Unfortunately, as I started to assault their phone book of a menu, I felt a huge drip on my back (it had been raining/pouring all day and night) and got up to look at the floor and see how wet it was etc; as it was clear to me from the moment the drop hit me where it had come from (a leaky roof).  The hostess came and asked if we wanted to move tables, hah.  I told her ""yea that would be great I don't want to be sitting at the low point of the roof where the water is all pooling when it decides to give in and collapse.  So we moved. Waited about 10 more minutes at new table for waiter to come by.  Clearly either this guy was new, sick, beat from working a long shift, or maybe helping taste test new batches of brew because he was just OFF.  Had to repeat everything, yea it was a lil loud in there, but we all spoke clearly with adequate volume for everyone else at the table to hear.  Wife's drink (tokyo tea) was watery like the ice had melted in the cup before they made the drink; my drink was wrong - lol batting 1000.  We got our orders for food in approx half hour after first being seated at leak table, terrible time conversion but by now they were slow so no urgency to turn the table I guess. Food came out slow, talking nearly 20 min from time of order.  Friends got chicken salads, the chicken was cut into weird chunks.  We have all seen where they cut the chicken into strips for visual appeal, it was not an attempt at that (lol the chicken also had no grill marks); it was just lazily diced too big - they goto bj's often (the destination was their pick not ours) and pointed out the chicken; we would have never known it was ""different"".  Wife got the Parmesan chicken; the chicken was good in the bite I had and she enjoyed it.  Her mashed taters were grainy, old, and dry like they had set a long time.  She didn't bother asking for butter as she was just ""over it"" in general.  My ""late night"" burger came out and I was excited about it, new concept and I love mexican food so I was excited for the chili verrde; and who doesn't like an egg on their burger right?  My burger came out of the kitchen without the fries; which were brought about 4-5 min later.  Well the chili verde must have been as old or older than my wife's mashers cuz it was soooo salty I had her taste it to make sure I wasn't crazy (you know how sauce cooks down and gets all salty?) or someone just did not follow the recipe at all.  The over saltyness rendered the $13 burger inedible.  I told the waiter about the burger and he offered to replace it, cool! In the waiter's defense, he was overall pleasant, and after about 5 min into waiting on my new order, asked if I wanted a soup or salad while I waited.  So another 10 minutes (for a total of 15, my wife and friends were DONE with their meals) my ""bbq brisket burger"" (or whatever they call the brisket topped burger) came out.  If I were Gordom Ramsey I would have summarily tossed the plate on the floor and yelled ""THIS IS STONE COLD"".  The bbq sauce was cold like it just came out of the refrigerator, there was literally 2 TINY morsels of brisket (net less than half an ounce, really), the patty seemed to have been reheated and allowed to cool again.  They were more than generous with the nearly frozen sauce though.  The burger did come out with fries this time on the first shot though, so atleast they got that part right.  I even told the waiter about it being cold, but that I didn't want to waste any more time trying to get something right from ""that"" kitchen. Before I could finish gagging down what I did eat of my burger, the waiter came by with the check and asked us if we could ""please take care of this right away as they are cutting me loose for the night"".  We never did see or have the manager visit our table through this ordeal. I really need to learn to be less accommodating when it comes to stuff like this.  I had wanted to goto Lucha Libre, which is good, and something I can ONLY get in San Diego.  I can go to any BJ's and get sub par food and over priced, warmish ""micro brew"".  I completely had low expectations from the beginning as I have not, and never will utter the phrase ""let's go to BJ's"" but have relented and gone a very few times over the years.  I did get a good burger one time at the one in Riverside, CA.  This was my 5th or 6th time going to a BJ's, there won't be another.  Usually it is just bad food, but the complete total lack of execution, and apparent apathy of the management is enough for me to wash my hands of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=140,3.2,2.93,3.084,2.148,3.0380000000000003

The food was kind of cold as well, what a waste of money.  If you do come here, get the deep dish pizza. BJ's cooks the crust quite well! The crust is crispy and has enough oil saturated in it to make it moist. Dry crust is a chore to eat, always need water since thirst overwhelms your desire to eat more crust. Not a problem here.

Well a few nights ago, I did just that. My friend and I went on Wednesday night, where they apparently were doing some kind of $10 burger night, so it was BUSY. The hostess at the front told us there would be a 15 minute wait if we wanted a table, but any seating at the bar was free for the taking. Amazing, we didn't have to wait for a table! I was wrong. We promptly perused the bar area for seating and found a booth that was being cleared, cleaned, and set up. So we swooped in and sat down. Not even a second later, a host comes up behind us and very rudely says, ""Uhh... I was saving this booth for someone else...."" to which I replied, ""Well the girl at the front told us it was open seating at the bar, so we decided to take the next booth."" That didn't seem to mull over well with him, because he didn't say a word. Anyway, about 30 seconds later, we find another booth a little further down and decided to sit there. Upon sitting, I just happened to glance over at the host station, where the host who so rudely spoke to us, was pointing us out, rolling his eyes, and the hostess girl joining in and shaking her head. I mean, come on, we all know how to complain about customers, and it isn't in plain view. If I wasn't already annoyed, I was at that point... After looking over the menu, we decided to order one of their $10 burger specials of the night. I ordered the Portobello Swiss Burger, medium-well. When I received the burger, it was bright pink in the middle. I'm not the type to complain, so I just dealt with what I was given. But as soon as I bit into the burger, I was overwhelmed with salt. Now, I'm a smoker, so usually I can't taste that much saltiness, but WOW... this was insane. I can only imagine what it would have tasted to someone who doesn't smoke... Yuck. So after some inspection of the burger and trying to figure out WHY it was so salty... I discovered it was the portobello mushroom caps. I just can't understand why in the hell someone would salt a mushroom cap THAT much... Makes no sense. So I ripped apart my burger, piece by piece, and decided STILL... that I would not complain... until now. I walked into this restaurant with an extremely open mind, having never been here before, but the rude staff and whatever the hell that damn kitchen staff (cooks, expos, whatever) are doing... it's going to cause people like me to leave a terrible review about terrible service and terrible food. If you're wanting burgers, I honestly suggest you go to In-N-Out. Surprisingly enough, their food is less salty and more cooked through than here at BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=120,2.84,2.9,3.028,2.212,2.876

Our waitress was Lauren and she was awesome!!  I would give Lauren 5 stars for such an attentive, friendly and all around great customer service. Unfortunately, the experience went soar when an employee who just finished her shift decide to steal the Bride-to-Be's( Sarah) sash.  Sarah had dropped the sash and and my other co-worker saw another person wearing it. Well this other person is Gabriela (or Gabrielle), who is an employee of BJ's.  She and another employee were sitting at the bar drinking and laughing like it was funny to steal a customer's belonging. Though she was off, she is still a representative of the restaurant. We requested for the manager, Kody, but he was useless!!  He did not reprimand the thief and allowed her to stay at the bar area without any repercussion. What manager will allow this is unbeknownst to me!! Apparently, stealing and staying at the scene without any consequence is absolutely ok for this facility. Kody's management style is a freakin' joke!!   After the bridal celebration, most of our party of 13 left already and three of us went to the bar. Sara was our bartender and she was awesome too.

But last nights meal with my boyfriend (aka date night) was incredibly underwhelming and to simply put it, the equivalent to really bad sex. Now, if I can preface my review, service wasn't bad at all. Our servers were fantastic, but the cook that night didn't any f**ks and it showed in the food.  We started off with the calamari, which was ehhh. Marinara was a tad bland but manageable. Side note: I think at that point, we should've just called it quits. My boyfriend is all about the pizzas, regardless of where we go. He's a self-proclaimed pizza connoisseur, so he got the deep dish sausage pizza and I had the BBQ bison burger. Now the last time I was there, I organized a work function hosted by BJ's and they complete delivered; food was bomb! My bf has never been to a BJ's so when I told him about my work function they hosted, he was excited.  Chicago natives would started a riot at the pathetic sight of the deep dish pizza that was served. I'm talking about doughy, thick, bland sausages, with a splash of cheese and a sprinkle of tomato sauce. We should've just picked up a Mama Celeste and asked the cook to heat up the oven. Cue my meal: I had asked for a side of fries with my burger since it only came with coleslaw. Now, when I usually order a burger, I'm asked how would I like it cooked. Didn't happen tonight and that should've been a red flag. My burger looked so sad; saturated in BBQ sauce, thin slice of emaciated lettuce, sprinkle of what looked like pico de gallo (not really sure about the connection there), and what thought I was suppose to be coleslaw but in turn was a pile of cabbage....THATS IT! I flagged down the server and asked if there was suppose to be a dressing. Looking kind of embarrassed, he comes back with a vinaigrette??? Huh????? I'm so confused at this point. Isn't coleslaw suppose to be creamy??? Not tangy!?  So disappointed. We had left overs but there was no way in hell I was letting that crap take up space in my fridge.

The second time, our waitress Mariah already seemed done with us so she told us to wait and to see if our order really was incorrect. I understand the servers don't make the food. But, she seemed more pissed that we were unsatisfied versus the fact that our food was messed up several times. One of our orders was good and correct, but she told us it was barely big enough for  a two people when the two of us could barely finish it. I aIso ordered a drink I received last time, and it was terribly oversweetened, I couldn't even finish it. I won't be back to this location any time soon.

We wish we could have him as our waiter every restaurant we go to now :(      More good news, if you visit on Saturday or Sunday Morning they have a simple but Delicious Breakfast menu! Another BIG advantage is they are open until 12am during the week and 1am on Fri & Sat which is late for the area, most places close at 9 or 10!      They are often busy, but you can seat yourself in the cocktail area which is convenient during rush hour. Unfortunately if you don't go to cocktail you sometimes have to wait up front for a host to show up to get seated especially during the daytime hours it seems. Huge selection of House and Guest beers to choose from (Their beers are All Very good!)

Unfortunately 2 of 3 of the things ordered were unsatisfactory. The Brussell Sprouts were completely burned and could not be eaten at all. I had ordered the chicken parmesan dinner and the chicken had an almost rubbery texture. It was so bad I couldn't eat even half of it (I order thus dish all the time and know what it's supposed to taste like). We called the manager on duty Andy and she refunded the Brussell Sprouts saying it wasn't the first complaint of the night. But proceeded to argue with us about the chicken stating that it didn't make sense and tried to justify that it probably wasn't as good because we ordered take out (pretty much discouraging us from ever buying take out from here again). The food was eaten 15 minutes after we picked it up. As far as customer service I never expect someone to argue with me about the quality of food. If I were in the restaurant I could have shown them the lack on quality of chicken (I tossed more than  half of it out). On a side note the pasta my boyfriend ordered was delicious.

113,Anthony S.,"Long Beach, CA",288,49,205.0,2.0,2017-05-21,"Normally I like BJ's restaurants, but this particular one is average at best. My last visit was yesterday when I was very hungry and I wanted to watch the Warriors game after a long graduation ceremony. I learned from my last visit that this location does not have tables in the main dining room that can seat parties greater than 6. For this reason, my family had to sit at a high table in the bar area. The table was sticky, and so the busboy wiped the table for us with a wet cloth, but that did not help at all. The waiter was very anti-social and seemed like he hated his life. When taking orders he stood on one side of the table. When he couldn't hear one of us, he did not move around to them so that he can. Instead, he stayed in one spot and spoke with a little bit of an attitude to get someone to speak up. After submitting our order, he told us he was going on break and made what seemed like a passive-aggressive joke about it. The person covering our table while he was on break was much nicer and was really attentive. Despite the below-average service from our previous waiter, we still gave a 20% tip. When you are hungry, food usually tastes really good, though the food here was just decent. It is not the same quality of other BJ's restaurants. However, the pizookie is good no matter which BJ's you choose to go to. As stated before, we came yesterday to watch the Warriors game. A lot of TVs had the game on but the only one i could actually see fully had the duck's game on. After the duck's game, nobody was looking at that TV anymore, so it was requested to be changed to the Warriors game. Someone agreed to change the channel, but did not, so we asked again. By the time we were done eating and paid the check, over 30 minutes have passed and the channel did not change. As for parking, the lot is almost always full so you have to walk a short distance. Majority of the spaces are for compact cars, some spaces acknowledged it, but some did not.

Our party of eight was promptly and efficiently seated after two tables were butted together.  We ordered beer by the pitcher (very cold !) but were presented warm glasses.  The selection of beers is spectacular. The beer menu shows the IBU scale (International Bitterness Units).  This scale will prevent any accidental orders of face-puckeringly bitter beer. My wife ordered the Seared Ahi salad ($15.95) and loved it!  She said it was perfectly prepared with an excellent dressing.  Sitting next to her, I can tell you, it looked good. My order was not up to par.  The Fish & Chips ($15.95) consisted of several small pieces of  cod, over-breaded and deeply ordinary, accompanied by a large amount of over-salted fries.  Perhaps the idea is to encourage more beer sales by over-salting?  It sure encouraged water consumption later ! There were other problems, given there were eight orders.  One was a hamburger that was way overcooked, although ordered medium rare, ironically accompanied by an undercooked baked potato.  Another individual had a food complaint, as well.  In addition, a discount card was presented but wasn't honored.  Granted, the manager very politely and quite obligingly rectified every problem, and the total bill was reduced accordingly.   The manager's professional behavior, and the good service we received make BJ's in Mission Valley A-OK in my book.  I'll make a different menu choice next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2,3.36,3.0,2.98,2.508,3.1440000000000006

I did not order one of their many well priced lunch specials but I did take advantage of their Mondays 1/2 priced deep pan or Tavern pizzas and a small wedge salad on the side of course. I went for BJ's Tavern Classic which came with mushrooms, pepperoni, and Italian mushrooms with a red sauce for $7.50. The salad was about $4. The wedge salad was very good and they recently changed their blue cheese dressing. It was a great change because the dressing was delicious. It was thick and creamy and came with tasty chunks of a mild blue cheese. The quart sliced wedge was crisp and fresh and I was pleased that they did not hold back on bacon. It was very good bacon too with a good crisp and a nice chew as well. It was a very nice salad over all. The Tavern Cut Pizza was good too, but they forgot the topping that was the main reason why I ordered the Tavern Classic, the mushrooms. When I brought it to their attention, they made a side of mushrooms to place onto the pizza, which was nice, but not the same.  If you like very thin crust pizza that is similar to a thin flat bread, these Tavern Cuts are for you. I like the thin crust and it surprisingly held up well to the ingredients a top. The pepperoni slices were tasty with a touch of spiciness, the crumbled Italian sausage was good, but although moist, it kinda had a spongy texture to it. I suspect it was previously frozen. The mushrooms I received were a little dry given they were not baked with the pizza nor were they sauteed. The red sauce was nice, not overly sweet nor acidic. Service was very good. Angela was attentive and certainly forgiving for the mistakes the kitchen staff made.

I had hopes for them making random a$$ ingredients work together cause they are a restaurant, but they failed miserably.  I have no idea why the place is always busy. The second time hubby got dry ribs -- huge no no. I got just a side of beets with goat cheese. HUGE potential - but someone decided to dump a lb of salt on it. Oops. Top that with the saltiness of the goat cheese, totally not a good combo. Their house beer is ok, but nothing special. I would opt for the bottle stuff instead. The only thing I've had there that has been ok has been a cheese dip.

It was also missing the green onions, which might have saved it.

I asked for an extra side of hot sauce for my wings, and when it appeared she had misunderstood, I repeated my request just for clarification. She proceeded to snap ""yes I'm going to get it now,"" and then (this is the part that blows my mind) rolled her eyes and shook her head IN MY FACE before storming to the kitchen. As someone who's worked in the service industry for 10+ years, I understand being stressed out during rush, and I even understand if you really need to vent by rolling your eyes and being nasty. But you do it privately in the back or at home, not in plain view of the customer. She ended this exchange by returning with my side and asking sarcastically if there was anything else I needed. The manager happened to come by (didn't get her name, but she had curly hair and glasses) and she was very pleasant and apologetic. She offered some pizookie coupons which was a nice gesture. I hope she spoke with Janelle about the situation -- she's not going to last long in the service industry if she keeps treating customers that way. Basic respect is a must.

The workers/ team members here exude a warm, friendly attitude. Gimme 5! And I loved their Enlightened menu my kind of low-calorie, superfoods, vegetarian and gluten-free options. We usually order: Chardonnay and Beers. My fave-Arugula Beet Salad, Salmon & Quinoa plate and their signature pizzas.

He was super hilarious and made me feel welcomed which was the big reason as to why I liked my experience. Also every fellow coworker was nice as well. Everything was prepared great. We had the avocado egg rolls, the Thursday rib special and their holiday ribeye special. BOMB  I had a great dinner and enjoyed our whole experience there.

I went with a friend on 12/05, no lines and the service was ok.  Talking about food, I asked a Bbq Bison burger and it was my first time trying it, I notice that my burger was to dry and asked the waitress if it would come with bbq sauce or the ""bbq"" was the way that burger was cooked?! She said that it should come with the bbq sauce, what wasn't there. I was already at the end of my burger and she offer if I wanted the sauce, sweet by her but not useful, I was almost done. My friend asked the classic Rib-eye, the rib was ok, nothing in special, the different quinoa that they charge a little be more, nothing in special again, the asparagus was supper bitter.

She just kept giving us a look like she didn't want us there & just kept giving attitude throughout the whole time. Our reservation was for 6, but they sat us at 4 seat table. So we had to wait another 30 mins before being seated to the correct table. Then another 30 mins before they started taking our order, another 30-40 mins before we actually got our food.

She had a bad attitude, and made our dinner uncomfortable. Also they messed up the bill in their favor with no apology upon having to fix it. It was a shame, cuz, like I said, I do like the pizza.

Not sure why they don't have a better score on here but my visits have gotten better since the first time i've been! Those with 3 stars and lower.. please let me know when you go.. so I don't go on those days. lol STORE: This location is in the same shopping center as Starbucks, Barnes and Nobles, Smash Burger, Which Wich, etc. There is a decent amount of parking here, you may just need to walk a smidge. The outside is always very clean when I go as well as the inside. This location tends to always be busy.. at least when I go. Which I would assume is a good thing..? right? lol. They have a bar, outside seating, T.Vs everywhere to watch sports, table sitting - booth sitting - high tables. Cant complain :) MENU: Large Menu - something I dislike is my menu is always sticky or stuck together.. that freaks me out since I can be a germaphobe, but other than that, theres something for everyone here. Pizza? sure. Pasta? Sure. Sammich? Sure. Watching your weight? Sure. Dont care how fat you are? Sure. My go-to for this place is always; - Strawberry Lemonade: sh* is bomb. Nuff sed. - Calamari appetizer: I'm not sure why I love their calamari so much but theyre one of the best ive had. There was one time it tasted different cause they used different calamari and I was about to lose it.. then came back and it was back to being the same deliciousness that I remember. So.. I can't complain lol - CHEESE CURDS appetizer: This was new on their menu when I first had them. Oh goood lawwwwrd I love me a cheese curd. Just deep fried cheese.. hell yeah! Just know its A LOT.. so be ready to share it or... eat it all, who am I to judge? lol - Chicken Alfredo Pasta: I tend to ask for extra sauce on the side cause it can be dry (at least to me since I like my sawwwce). So I like to control the sauce by pouring it myself. - PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN BREAST: My favorite!!! It's topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. That is a goooood night. If you want to substitute the sides you obviously can, but I never do cause I like to pretend that I am somewhat healthy lol. - PIZOOKIE: Just all of them. Its a must. My fave is getting the trio cause... well who wouldnt want 3 different cookies with ice cream?! Cookies and Cream is my fave tho! WORKERS: It can be a hit or miss, but as of lately all of them have been great. I always give extra points when they give you extra napkins and refill your drink before you even ask. Those are my sweet spots. lol NEGATIVE: Nothing really worth reporting. I've had slow service before or had to redo one of my meals but I meal, everyone has their off days. So as of now, not much.. OVERALL 1-5: Location (outside): 4 Location (inside): 4 Appearance (product): 4 Service: 4 Taste: 4 Mouth feel:  4 Overall: 4 Would I come back?: Always do.. lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2,3.4,2.97,2.904,,3.1420000000000003
