47,Seth M.,"Lancaster, PA",23,29,53.0,3.0,2013-01-28,"We've gone to many Chili's over the years because my parents loved the hamburgers. We ate here on Sunday 1/27/13 because we hadn't tried it yet. We came in with moderate expectations. Our server, Eric, was great. He was in the ball, quick and attentive. My problem is with the food.  My wife had the ribs which were decent enough, apparently correctly made if not extraordinary. My dad had the shrimp tacos which he did enjoy. My mom got the hamburger, and this is where things start to go downhill. The burger was greasy, cold and way overcooked. She's not the kind to return food but I definitely am.  I had the 6 oz. steak and boy what a hassle. I requested medium rare and was first brought a medium well. Next they brought some terrible looking piece of old steak that was cooked to medium rare but when I cut into it the manager (who by that point waited to see if it was done right) was as shocked as I was to see the color. Not a juicy red center but rather the brown of old steak. He rushed it away and brought back what was finally an OK steak. Nicely seared, perfectly medium rare and surprisingly tender.  The sides were not good. I left 90% of the mashed potatoes because they were dry, flavorless and cold and the broccoli was mushy and overcooked.  Overall I'd say 50% ok and 50% dismal. I don't think we'll be going back, though I'm sure they probably only do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster?start=20,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

I've been to Chili's now maybe 3 times, and each time I went I always thought the menu was small. You see commercials all the time that make you think they really have a wide variety of food, but to me the menu doesn't seem to follow through on that promise (but maybe its just me). Still, the food has always been good and the last time I was at this particular location the service was very good.  *My only major complaint about Chili's was that the Molten Chocolate Cake didn't come with enough ice cream or milk (but that could just be because the person I was sharing with ate it all and left me with a plate of chocolate or chocolate chocolate cake)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

The soda was flat, upon sharing this information with the waitress she said, ""the machine has been broken for 3 weeks and can't be fixed."" We ordered new drinks, not getting what we wanted.  We then ordered our dinner. We waited forever for boneless buffalo wings and a chicken fajita. When the food was brought out the boneless buffalo wings were rubbery and cold and the ""fixings"" for the fajita came out with out the chicken. By the time the chicken was delivered, we had been at the restaurant for 2 hours and I had not received anything worth waiting for.  I had the manager remove the buffalo wings from the bill and went home to make myself dinner. Never again will I be visiting this establishment.

39,Bill G.,"Lancaster, PA",23,6,2.0,1.0,2014-11-02,"I'll be as brief as possible: 1) the parking situation is a joke. The parking lot for the restaurant is big enough to fit maybe 1/2 of the restaurant on a busy night. The overflow parking is so poorly lit, and so traffic heavy that it's a hazard to walk through the lot to get to the front door.  2) the waits are endless. On a busy Saturday (I get it, it's busy), we waited 50 minutes for a table we were told would take 30. We then waited another ten minutes for our drinks and to order, after ordering it took another 30 minutes for our food to arrive. We had some chips and salsa as an appetizer but this apparently means about ten chips and the entire bottom of a bag of broken chips here, nothing but small broken pieces. Getting these swapped out took another five minutes. We're up to an hour and a half for those keeping score.  3) the food quality was poor. Out of four orders, only two were passable. Somehow chilis managed to mess up a regular cheeseburger (it was charred on the bottom and was to be cooked medium. It looked like someone left it in a pan. The definition of cheesefries here also must be congealed cheese around a mass of cold fries because that's what the second order that was messed up looked like. The manager assured us this would be made right and he'd pay for it out of his pocket (how virtuous and kind. We surely weren't going to.) Long story short, but more waiting - another 15 minutes on a burger and some fries. They came out looking mediocre but by this time no one cared enough to say anymore.  4) our server was too busy to pay attention to us. Repeatedly we had to stop her as she helped other tables, to ask for drinks, to fix our order, to refill chips, whatever. We're not high maintenance people but if you walk past us, just ask if we need anything once in a while. 5) the 10-15 dollars taken off of our bill was fine, but where's the consideration for the almost two hours of time wasted, that a party of four essentially had to eat in shifts and watch the other two eat, and for the overall lack of service? Our party member who had the burger managed to still be charged the 2.50 or whatever it is for his iced tea - how nice of you to comp his meal but charge for the drink when he waited so long to even eat. Bottom line: don't expect much here. The folks at the bar are nice but the actual dining room is lousy. Come for apps and drinks at the bar. Highly recommend you stay away for anything else, it's just not worth it. Go up the street to Lyndon Diner for a better and more friendly experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster?start=20,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005

After waiting 35 minutes, a summoned a manager.  The manager all but admitted the server forgot to put in our order.  To her credit, she gave us some chips to snack on, and made sure our food came out quickly. I was going to give it 3-stars, because I believe there's value in managers doing the right thing.  And our food did taste good.  It just took 45 minutes to cook. But then came the bill - the bill was a real head scratcher.   99 cents for ""table entertainment""?  What's that?  The stupid touch screen?   What a racket!   Ok, 99 cents is nothing to me, but to try to sneak that into the bill, without mentioning it is bad form.

20,John M.,"Portage, PA",67,4,,1.0,2015-04-01,"I am rarely motivated enough to write a review but I must say the rudeness and ineptness of the hostess at this Chili's moved me to write this. I am by no means a ""pushy customer."" But after waiting 75 minutes for a quoted 25 minute wait time and seeing many who arrived after our party be seated, I decided to ask the hostess how much time we had left.  She said, ""I don't know."" I explained to her that she told us 25 minutes, 50 minutes ago.  I was told, ""I guess we were wrong"".  No apology offered, no empathy, just attitude.  When I asked how much longer, I was told ""not sure, whenever your table becomes available.""  I asked for an estimate of where we were at in the line. Again, this question was met with ""whenever your table becomes available."" After speaking with my family for a few minutes, we began to leave and our buzzer magically went off for our seating.  We should have just left when the buzzer went off but at that point, we were all tired and hungry so we took the table.  I am guessing they skipped over our name accidentally several times in the book and only noticed after my inquiry. I get it..they were busy and mistakes happen but not once did anyone express regrets for our wait time or any empathy at all. Our waitress was fine and the food was standard..but again, no acknowledgement of the any issue, problem, or of the wait itself.  Everyone has bad employees but maybe this Chili's should consider if they should be customer-facing positions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster?start=40,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003

There were no high chairs avaliable when we arrived, but this is one of the few times a hostess remembered to bring one over when one became avaliable.  For starters we got pickle chips. The coating had fallen off most of them, probably because they were not dried before being coated. For an entree I got a burger and it was good and cooked properly. My wife got a medium steak with loaded mashed potatoes. The steak was not medium, it was very well done and Pittsburgh style on the outside. Now I like Pittsburgh style but you still need to get the inner temp correct.  I can forgive a steak being overcooked, but the potatoes were nasty. They were either old or over whipped because the glutton level was high, i.e. it was like chewing cement. My son had normal mash potatoes and his had the same quality.

6,Amber S.,"Lancaster, PA",182,130,185.0,2.0,2016-12-06,"Almost every time I visit this location, the service is HORRIBLE! When arriving, I was sat within 10 minutes, which was great, but from there....not so much!  We decided we were going to order the triple dipper app, along with some cheese fries, well that took at least 45 minutes to come out, which I find a little ridiculous. When it came to getting drink refills, they were not prompt either, especially the beer.  The best part, the waitress decided to add something we didn't even order onto the bill (which mistakes happen, no biggie), I mentioned to her, she moves it from one check to another, I mention it again (she comes back with her excuse), and then it is finally removed. Please double check your final bill before paying!  When it came to the food, it tasted great, good flavor and cooked well, however, the service was just too much of a downfall to matter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

5,Brittany H.,"Germantown, MD",96,153,211.0,4.0,2017-02-21,"I ordered dinner to go from this chilis location. I got a 6oz sirloin with veggies and the skillet mashed potatoes for sides. Just a warning for people like myself who assume mashed potatoes are just that, potatoes. They come with some sort of melted cheese and sautéed onions on them. I asked for the steak done medium well and when I got home to eat it was a bit underdone.  Overall the meal was good and the price was fair. The service however was quite slow when picking up. I was asked multiple times if I was being helped which was nice and attentive all of whom offered to find someone to assist me. The only issue being none of them themselves were actually waiting on me so that I could have my food and leave. The experience wasn't bad but next time I'd consider dining in instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

3,Maria D.,"Lancaster, PA",46,468,498.0,2.0,2017-07-03,"Chili's is one of those places that I pass on the daily but never have a desire to go to.  On the few occasions I did stop here I always expected more and got less. I struggle every time with the menu, nothing really excites me and I don't know why.  I want to like this place.  It's close and alot of my friends go here but it just doesn't appeal to me. Maybe it's the tex-mex recipes, although they have burgers too.  I've gotten some good crispy chicken strips in a dish although it looked nothing like the menu featured picture.  But the fries are disgusting!  Old, dry, and frozen, you'd think for a chain restaurant they would at least do something, anything to try to make them better.  Maybe a sprinkle of cheese and spices, something!  But they are like eating paper.  Even dipping them in condiments doesn't save those fries.  I liked that corn on the cob came with the one dish but they smothered it in pepper making it all but inedible.   Service is hit or miss, although more miss than hit.  Wait staff is never especially friendly, but drag along and do what they need to do. Parking lot is usually empty at this location, so empty that the 3 occasions we've been here in the past few years we questioned if they were open. Overall blah food, blah experience, every times.  Been there three times now and they're out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

It was not a busy night, so we were not rushed out at all. It was actually a pleasing experience. We upgraded the 2 for $22 to the 2 for $35, which includes an appetizer, two entrees, two margaritas, and a dessert. Can't beat it.

It was not available until 7:37. Is this what to go is in your restaurants? If so you have lost a to Go customer for a long time! Not to mention there was no parking and it was pouring down rain. And I tipped a nice tip in order for someone to help me out. No one came no one helped me and the food took 30 minutes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

2,Jamie C.,"Akron, PA",24,85,130.0,3.0,2017-10-30,"Pretty decent for a chain restaurant. The prices aren't bad and the have a great selection of food. Chicken, ribs, seafood, burgers, steak etc. While I was there I got the chicken fajitas. It came out sizzling. They were pretty good but for my taste I wish it would have had a little more seasoning. It came with rice, peppers, onions and all the fixings on the side. I also go the Texas cheese fries which were also good. They come with bacon, cheese, jalapenos, and onions. All in all it was a pretty decent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
7,Ed P.,"Lancaster, PA",9,74,13.0,3.0,2017-11-12,"Decided to go to Chili's for the FREE Veteran's meal.  Some places give you a menu selection for that occasion, they were no different here.  I'm thinking half a rack of ribs maybe???  NOT.  Chicken this... Chicken That..  Enchilda..  or a burger.  I opted for the burger because who goes to a Rib joint and orders Chicken Crispers, Chicken Bacon Ranch Quesadillas, Chili or Soup & Salad.  I opted for the Old-timers Burger over the Classic Bacon Burger.  Not sure why they just didn't say ""Anything under $10""  I would have been more satisfied.  In any case, when my Medium Rare burger arrived (instead of the ribs I was craving), it was more on the Medium to Medium Well side.  They were SO busy, I opted to just eat the damned thing instead of making a fuss over something that was FREE in the first place.  It had a good taste to it and I loved the ""crust"" on it.  The fries tasted double-fried which is a good thing.  All in all, a good meal.  I can always go back and get my ribs another time.  (A whole rack, not that silly half rack thing!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
