Their menu is large but I recommend the ca cheesesteak or the Chinese chicken salad. Their lunch menu ""Renees special"" is great as well.

J T.,"Fullerton, CA",11,501,49,4.0,3/21/2016,"We have been to numerous Cheesecake Factory Restaurants. This location is decent with plenty of parking within the Irvine Spectrum. The wait is always long since this place is always packed. At least, you can walk around the shops while you wait.  The service is always great. We love the classy decor. The Thai Lettuce Wrap is amazing. I order this item every time. Of course, the dessert is great but $10.00 per slice is a little steep. We love the Mint Chip Cheesecake and Pumpkin Cheesecake whenever they are in season.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=260
Linda K.,"Corona, CA",15,51,48,1.0,11/21/2016,"On 09/14/16, members of our family dined at the Cheesecake Factory in Irvine, CA. We had just attended the funeral of my beloved Mother at a nearby cemetary. We chose this restaurant due to it's convenience and ability to please all members of our group with a variety menu. Once seated, we began to notice 'gnats'. A few at first, but as we waited for our meals it was apparent the 'gnats' were not diminishing in number. Mgmt was notified,  offered to relocate our entire group, but, not with a guarantee we would not deal with the bugs in another area. Mgmt informed us that the restaurant was due the following day to receive a 'monthly' bug treatment, and was very nonchalant about the ordeal. We tolerated the gnats, we ate our meals and then received the bill, $375.57. Nothing deducted. While waiting to pay our bill, members our family used the restroom facilities. As they walked down the hallway where restrooms are located, they passed by a small wait-staff area. There they noticed the parmesan cheese that had been grated upon several of our meals. It was uncovered and had GNATS on it! We watched our waitress go to thy area of the restaurant to retrieve the block of parmesan when it was requested. There is no doubt it was the same cheese!. Anyone had access to that cheese, yuck! If that wasn't enough, the cheese is in plain site of everyone, adults, children...bugs. Mgmt gave me a $50 gift card after all was said and done. I expected a refund after that nonsense and health department violation filled experience. I have contacted the corporate office. Waiting for a response. I did tip the waitress $75.00 ,after all she was just following protocol of the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=260

Marina B.,"Irvine, CA",1,17,4,1.0,7/24/2016,"I usually come to this location because I like the Irvine Spectrum area. Came here a lot of times and I have never had an experience this bad. The table was dirty, the menu was sticky, and the servers were lost in the restaurant. We started being served by a girl and suddenly a guy came to help us, nobody told us anything. The drinks took a long time to arrive, no water was served or asked if we would like some. We ordered the fettuccini alfredo pasta and the coulotte steak with fries as we always do. The sauce in the pasta was nothing like alfredo, there was also too much persil which I haven't seen before, at least not on the ones I had at the Cheesecake Factory before. The coulotte was way too much rare. We normally have it medium rare which comes in the perfect way, not too much rare and not too much dry. But this time it was completely rare, it was bloody inside and burned outside. We asked the server to make it a little bit less rare, and when it came back it was still the same way and the server told us that when we order medium rare that's how it comes. I'm sorry but we came here more than ten times, for sure, none of the times we were here the steak came like that.  I do not recommend this location for both service and taste reasons. For sure not coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=260

I asked for a table and was given one that was in the process of being cleared. Because the busboy was rushed by the hostess, he did a half-assed job of wiping it down. There were crumbs and liquid on the table. We flagged someone down to get them to wipe it. No one came.  15 minutes or so later, after no one cleaned our table, and no one came to even ask for drink orders, we walked out. I told the hostess we were leaving, and why, and she said nothing.

So we wait another 15-20 min to get a 'new dish' all the while the waiters and manager make it seem like they're doing us a favor by making it new. It was burnt! Waiter asked 3 times if replacement dish was better. Of course it's better! It's not burnt! Aside from a condescending apology from the manager, no other form of compensation offered.

After he brought us our drinks & finally took our order he ignored us for the next 45 minutes, no refills , didn't check on us or even look over at our table for us to get his attention. We then went up to the front & complained to the hostess after asking for a manager. The food finally came out after we had been sitting for about an hour after we ordered & my moms cheeseburger came with no cheese. When Michael came to check on us my mom simply asked for a piece of cheese for her burger. He took the burger & as he was walking away rolled his eyes! SO RUDE. didn't apologize or anything. So we asked for the manager AGAIN. this time he came to our table, we explained to him what happened and he said sorry & that Michael rolling his eyes was unacceptable . Michael then continued to check on us after that but with an attitude. When he brought the bill we expected a little something for the inconvenience & poor service but nothing. the manager never came back over to check on us nor did michael ever apologize. worst service i've ever had & i will definitely not go back here after poor management. very disappointed .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=260

My favorite appetizers are the buffalo blast, macaroni cheese balls, crab cake bites, or the calamari! You can't go wrong with either! Especially with the buffalo blast or the macaroni balls!

Stacy F.,"Orlando, FL",1320,1460,7211,4.0,2/10/2015,"One of the restaurants that you can find within the Irvine Spectrum Center - this location has all the typical offerings one can expect from the chain. We have always had a good experience here. It's important to note that Thurs - Sun it can get really hectic inside of the Spectrum area in general, so having a reservation or being okay with a slight wait time is part of the deal. They have a good happy hour menu during the regular week so if you want to partake in that you'll need to find a seat at the bar.  Overall: A A good spot for the chain. Can get busy on weekends.

Mayan R.,"Irvine, CA",110,26,12,4.0,1/2/2018,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Spectrum is a great spot to meet up with friends for drinks and/or dinner. Unfortunately there are certain times (including Friday nights) when they are unable to make reservations, so we had to wait about 40 minutes to be seated. I wouldn't suggest waiting inside the restaurant because it is really rowdy, with lots of children running around. If you can find room in the bar, that's a nice place to chill out while waiting for a table. As always, Cheesecake Factory offers a menu filled with a wide selection of dishes (which are all massive-- big enough to share), complimentary bread baskets, and of course amazing dessert! Highly recommend the Oreo Cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine
Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",751,678,46,2.0,1/8/2018,"Et tu, Cheesecake Factory? I can't believe this abysmally low rating I'm giving to start out my 2018 on Yelp. But my brunch experience with the family this past Sunday sadly dashed my traditionally high expectations. Our server, Michael, and everyone else front of house that we encountered was very kind, if not a bit... off, to say the least. The hosts and hostesses seemed flummoxed, to put it mildly. If they're all turned upside down during quite possibly one of the busiest times of the week, then something else may be amiss. Toward the end of our meal, servers were asking if we would like boxes. Before we were all done. Then it took forever and a day to close out the bill. Right after receiving our food, we practically had to keep our water refills at bay. As we again were finishing, water was nowhere to be found. Thankfully a smile and genuine positive attitude, which all of our CF FOH exhibited, go a truly long way. Seven in our party, seven orders clearly made, six dishes come out. The missing one? The freaking pancakes, bacon and eggs. The easiest food. The kitchen had to redo my cousin's overeasy eggs because they'd become 'over hard' in the interim. What??? Apologies abound. These minute faults could easily be overlooked had I not been SUPREMELY disappointed in my entree. Fried chicken and waffles Benedict??? How could this go wrong? Chicken: fresh and plentiful but dreadfully underseasoned. A waffle clearly neither dense nor crisp enough to hold the weight of a Benedict dish. The breakfast potatoes, Hollandaise sauce and poached eggs were simply lovely. But sides, accompaniments, and nicely cooked eggs does not a brunch specialty make. The most heartbreaking component of this dish was the maple butter syrup. Which, btw, tasted like neither maple nor butter. Nor syrup. It was a thickened, glossy, watery version of lightly seasoned margarine. I don't get why this is even served when this is supposed to be the piece de resistance tying together an ambitious fusion dish as such. Anyway, the saving graces: the Pasta Napoletana, though denounced as being excessively unhealthy, is super yummy. Everyone else mostly loved their burgers and chicken dishes. Lastly, our key lime cheesecake was to die for! Sorry, Cheesecake Factory, but you're gonna have to win me back eventually if I'm gonna drop that much coin and wait that long for meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine
Shay N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",165,151,127,1.0,1/7/2018,"Just had the WORST visit to CCF that I've ever had. I have visited many locations in different states and have always had excellent experiences but today was unbelievable. I came here with two other people today (my boyfriend and friend). When we sat down, our waiter said he had 5 minutes left and someone else would be taking over. Once the new waiter arrived, I believe his name was Michael?, he seemed nice but we had no idea we would be stuck there for another 4 hours. After our dinner arrived, our waiter asked if we wanted anything else. My friend and I ordered a Smores cheesecake and a Salted caramel cheesecake. He said okay and left. 10 minutes later he came back and asked if we wanted dessert. We looked a little confused but repeated our order anyway. He left for another 10 minutes and came back and asked what we ordered. So we told him AGAIN. At this point, we are wondering why he did not write the order down. It was embarrassing that we had to tell him so many times.. Another 10 minutes goes by, he comes back around and says ""the receipt printer is broke can you tell me what your order was?"" So we told him AGAIN. Finally after waiting 45 minutes on our cheesecake, he finally brought it. For a while there, we actually thought we were being pranked because none of us have ever experienced something like this.  But the evening didn't end there. He brought a check by, it said 74 dollars. He didn't ask if we wanted to split it so we asked if we could split it (one check for my boyfriend and I combined, and another check for my friend). He said okay and took the check and walked away. 15 minutes later, he comes back and asks if we wanted to order anything. We looked at him, said no thanks, and he walked away. He came back shortly after with the SAME check and acted like we never asked for our check split. So we sat and waited for him to come back so we could tell him we wanted to split it again. Another 10 minutes goes by and he eventually comes by with the split check..  Our total ended up being around 47 dollars for my boyfriend and I. We put down TWO $20 bills and ONE $10.. He took our checks and came back saying we owed him $12 dollars. At this point we were furious. My boyfriend told him we paid with TWO $20s and ONE $10 and the waiter sat there ARGUING with us saying we did not give him any cash. We asked him how else would we have paid and he KEPT arguing saying we did not pay cash, again and again. After a few minutes he pulled out a check from his pocket and said ""oh is this your money??"" and Of course it was our correct ticket with both $20's and our $10. We have never heard of a waiter misplacing our money and then blaming us and accusing us of not paying.  I cannot believe that the management would let a waiter act like this to customers. We were so furious that we did not even wait for the manager. We hurried up and left as fast as we could since we had been there for almost 4 hours because our waiter kept us. What we dont understand is how tables with more people next to us, came in and out much faster than our table of 3... Either way, it was a miserable experience and I do not understand why this is acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine
Chase P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",26,36,11,1.0,1/6/2018,"This was literally the WORST restaurant experience I've ever had. I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. Obviously their food is so good and they have a huge menu. BUT.......the service I had tonight was HORRIBLE. I felt like I was being punk'd. CCF is one of the most known restaurants and this is the only one I've had a bad experience at. Usually they have very good/experienced waiters who are on it and I'm wondering if the waiter I had tonight is always like this or if it was just a bad day for him. I was looking around because I literally thought there were cameras or something and we were being pranked.  So my girlfriend, her friend, and I were going to have dinner and my gfs friend has been there plenty of times. She usually never has an issue. Our first waiter came to our table and said ""Hello, I'll be your waiter for the next five minutes."" That was just a weird way to approach customers. Anyways, our second waiter approached us in a nice manner and seemed fine. He took our order and then we asked for more bread. Five minutes later he came back and gave us water and asked if we needed anything else. Once again, we asked for more bread. No complaints. I understand people forget sometimes. Thirty minutes later he brought our food, which is normal, but then brought the bread after. Not a huge deal so whatever.  WHAT REALLY GOT ME is when he asked if we need anything else after we were done eating and we said we'd like to order cheesecake. He asked what kind, we told him what we wanted, and then he said he'll go get it. About ten minutes later he came back and was like ""can I get you guys anything else."" Once again, we told him what type of cc we wanted. He said he'll go get it. He then came five min later AGAIN, and asked what type of cheesecake we wanted because he forgot. At this point, I'm like is he high or just very forgetful. So we told him again. The FOURTH time he came back and said ""we had a mix up in the bakery with some receipts. The receipt machine broke.......so what kind of cheesecake did you want?"" We told him AGAIN. I feel like that was a lie to cover up him forgetting for the fourth time. We just thought it was funny and laughed about it but wasn't too annoyed......yet. Luckily, we weren't in a rush or anything but if this were to happen to anybody else, they would of complained to a manager at this point. I was whatever about it because we had plenty of time so oh well.  Later on, he brought the check and combined all three of our orders, without asking if we'd like so split. So I asked if he could split the check between my girlfriend and I, and her friend. He took the check and left but then about 10 min later, he came back with the same check and acted like nothing was wrong. I was convinced that we were being punk'd at this point. I was so confused, shocked, and annoyed. I waited for him to come back and asked again if we can split the check. He took the check again and brought us two separate checks this time. My total was like $47 and some change so I put two 20s and a ten then handed it to him. He brought back the check and said I owe $12.34!????? I was so frustrated and told him I gave him $50 and he argued with me saying that I didn't pay cash???? So I explained like 5 times that I paid $50 cash and finally he was like ""oh I gave you the wrong ticket."" He then brought back the correct ticket and said sorry about that, have a good night. I will NEVER be going back to this restaurant. Instead of complaining to a manager, I just left a $2 tip. I didn't want to complain and him possibly get fired because I don't know what his situation is or what personal problems he has. Definitely did not expect this to happen at CCF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine

The staff is awesome. Our server was quick, efficient, polite. She gave us TWO servings of bread. I know what I'm grateful for this year. Thanks girl. The food is pretty good. However, in typical Cheesecake Factory style, their menu is EXTENSIVE. It will take a hot minute or two to read through it and decide. I ordered my spaghetti and meatballs and my boyfriend chose steak.  My only complaint is how loud it was. Granted, we were squeezed between two larger tables and groups of women obviously catching up with their girlfriends and bff alcohol, so yeah it was gonna be loud. I don't blame the restaurant for their customers lack of manners. However, my boyfriend does wish they served a bigger portion size of steak and mashed potatoes.

I ordered a Vegan Cobb with the dressing on the side + chicken, but it came out dressed with no chicken. It was corrected the second time around, but I felt like they really skimped on the toppings.  In addition, there was pieces of bread and goldfish on the floor which made our dining experience a little unpleasant. I get that it's always busy here, but please take the time to do a quick sweep under the tables if there is food on the floor!

Unfortunately, the meal experience gets ruined when you get poor service. Our waitress was not interested in helping us. Was very cold and short. Was looking at another table's check while taking our water orders, was look around at other tables while taking our meal orders (we had to repeat ourselves), did not refill our waters at all throughout meal, ask if we wanted dessert (even though we had previously inquired about it).

Jannell L.,"San Marcos, CA",217,137,202,4.0,9/30/2017,"The cheesecake factory is my favorite restaurant! This particular location isn't exactly my favorite but it is up there. My most recent dinner here was a little atypical since I came around 10:30pm on a Friday night. They usually close at 11pm on other weekdays but Fridays they close at 12:30am so it was okay. We were seated right away and within 5 minutes, our server came. She was very nice and friendly and took our orders and asked if we wanted bread. We said yes and a few minutes later, she came back with bread and butter. However, there was only rye bread instead of the usual sourdough, white, and rye. It was okay though, I think it's just cause we came so late. But then, she also gave us butter but no butter knives. We used our spoons to spread the butter.  Then, she came back and said they were out of the buffalo blasts - once again, our fault for coming so late. So then we ordered the fried cheese (mozzarella sticks). They were shaped like Doritos and tasted wonderful. It came with marinara sauce but the sauce tasted a little to watery and tomato-y.  Our spicy chipotle chicken pasta came and it was delicious as always. When she was taking our order, I asked if they could split it (Which they usually do) but she said that she could just bring an extra plate. I thought it was weird since I've never had the cheesecake factory not split my entree when asked. But it's okay, maybe they just don't do that here. However, she also forgot to ask if we wanted cheese grated on top!  The pasta itself isn't too creamy or spicy, it's a very light hint of spice. It's perfectly savory and the portion is def share worthy. To end the night, we got the tiramisu cheesecake which was delicious. Not too creamy and not top sweet with just enough coffee flavor to balance out the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine

Michael G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",244,338,12,4.0,11/7/2017,"As most of you know Cheesecake Factory menus are larger than most Sunday morning newspapers, so later I'll give my top 3 recommendations.  They probably have 50 items over 1500 calories but they've done a good job offering healthy alternatives.  We've at this particular location a few times and one of the highlights is always sitting outside which they have a huge amount of seating. One negative aspect is the wait, although they have a lot of tables many of them are not open for service. This trip today I waited over 30 minutes at 1230 for an outdoor spot - which for a Tuesday in November seems a bit excessive.  My top 3 dishes  1.  Chicken and Business (biscuits) 2. Super antioxidant salad with chicken 3. Meatloaf  Appetizers - avocado egg rolls and factory nachos  Pro Tip - no more calorie counts BEWARE!!!! BUT SkinnyLicious Menu and super food listings - check it! As well as the lunch menus specials.  Try the new birthday cake cheesecake to top it all off.  Great spot in the spectrum and for business meetings.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine

Food is delicious!  Who: Family parties, Date night vibes, friends, kids are OK  What: Cheesecake, Pasta (Farfalle chicken bow tie w/ roasted garlic & Jambalaya), sandwiches, small hot plates  When: Weekend nights expect an hour + wait, lunch time is always better if you're just trying to test it out.  Where: Multiple Locations across Cali roughly 17 different ones, food is pretty consistent amongst most locations!

Lynn B.,"Corona, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/7/2017,"Went to Cheesecake Factory for our Christmas work luncheon on December 6th. A little disappointing. Our reservation was for 1:00.  We did not get seated for 20 minutes. They told me they were busy with take out orders when I asked why we had to wait so long.  The Service was slow and we waited awhile for drinks and bread to be serviced. I understand that near the holidays any place can be busy.  But I noticed several people standing around talking. I would say you are unorganized.  I did not ask my co-workers about their meal.  My meal was not great. The brown rice was hard and not cooked.  The waiter noticed that I did not eat much of my meal, he asked if I did not like it. I told him about the meal.  He said oh we like to know these things I will tell the cook so we can improve. That was all that was said.  There were 12 in our party and I am sure my boss gave a generous tip.  Very disappointed to say the least. Next time will select another restaurant. You really have plenty of room for improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine

I picked the chicken and biscuits,  maybe I shouldn't have.    The chicken tasted like it was cooked in hot water, would it be too much to ask for it to be grilled. The mashed potatoes were not has hot as they should be, the gravy was okay, but the real sin was the biscuits.  For a restaurant of this size I expect freshly made biscuits. These were something you would get at McDonald's. Hard little hockey pucks, just terrible biscuits.  Staff was attentive, but if you know something is good at Cheesecake Factory. Stick with it.

I received my virgin pina colada and it was the best part of my meal.  I ordered the Miso Salmon with brown rice and my husband ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp with brown rice.  We were a party of nine (7 adults and 2 kids). The waitress asked if we wanted the kids mac and cheese first so that came out with the complimentary bread. The rest of the food took close to 45 minutes. We basically filled up on the bread and butter and our drinks.  The salmon was pretty dry. The miso sauce was good so combining that with the rice, I was able to eat half of my meal. My husband's dish was pretty average tasting. Black beans had a weird after taste.

Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213,1.0,11/19/2017,"I really can't think of a worse dining experience I've had in a very long time I made the mistake of coming here with some friends for my birthday dinner.  We got seated fairly quickly and then everything just went downhill. The server came over and asked for our drink order.  Either a long night or just her, but man she was not friendly to deal with.  She was very rushed and gave us the feeling that we were slowing her down by not knowing exactly what we wanted to drink after 30 seconds of sitting down.  It wasn't busy, so I still don't understand the rush.    After hastily giving our drink orders, she returned to take our dinner orders. I asked her a question about a burger because I wanted to make sure I was getting what I wanted.  Don't worry - that piece of information will come back into play later. After awhile the food came and this is where it got really bad.  First, the orders came individually and at slow intervals.  Someone got their plate of food and then a few minutes later someone else got their order and so on.  After about 10 minutes, we all had our food.  Mine was last and it was wrong.  It came with some items on it I definitely didn't want (which is why I asked about it during ordering).  The guy who brought the food took it back to fix it.  When the waitress returned she said, ""earlier you challenged me on what came on your burger and I was wrong, so we're getting that taken care of for you.""  What an odd way to phrase that.  I challenged her?  It's called asking a question.  That somewhat passive aggressive statement really defined her service all night. Someone else at the table ordered baked potato soup and after one spoonful almost spit it out.  She said there was something clearly wrong with it, but couldn't figure out what it was.  We were all just curious at that point and took tastes and it was definitely very odd/gross tasting.  Almost like baked potato soup got mixed with clam chowder and rotten onions.  We sent that back of course.  But she didn't want anything else - the taste really killed it for her. My burger finally returned, but of course with another issue. I like my burgers cooked a bit more and ordered it medium well.  It wasn't.  It was medium rare - very undercooked.  I think they remade it and then rushed it. I hate undercooked ground beef.  I ate around the edges was done.  Didn't want to deal with it anymore.  And on top of all that, several other severs would stop by our table wanting to drop off food that we didn't order.  ""Who had the spaghetti?""  ""Not us"".  That happened with different items like 5 times during the evening.  I just wanted to leave.  I was done.  An odd terrible dining ""experience"". Why is this a big deal?  Not just because it was my birthday, but more importantly, we had a group of friends together that don't get to see each other that often and we just wanted to enjoy a meal together.  And  this restaurant wouldn't let us have a nice meal together.  We got a rushed passive aggressive server, staggered orders so we couldn't even eat as a group, gross food that tasted very troubling, and incorrect orders.  Now, I'm sure Cheesecake factory will respond to this review with the same somewhat generic response they've responded to ALL the negative reviews... and if you look there are a lot of them.  They'll apologize, say that they hope we return and give them another chance (can't wait for that - and plus, why the hell would I want to?), they'll very subtly shift blame and tell you that you should have let a manager know, and say they'll say they'll talk and address this with the team.  But that's all nonsense.  Look at all the negative reviews... if this place actually addressed the issues here like they say, why would it still be such a disaster?  Nothing will be done.  Cheap PR on Yelp to save face a bit. We wasted money and time here and hopefully this review will help you avoid doing the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine

We came in during one of the oddest hours with minimal customers expecting the highest of food quality and customer service. This was approximately 3pm on a Tuesday. First and foremost, we were rudely told to wait 20 minutes. As we were seated, we were met with the sound of very loud and annoying music. I asked FIVE employees to lower the music until I had to find a sixth. Complimentary bread and butter took a very long time to be served and it came out cold. We ordered the chicken littles and da vinchi pasta which are two of our favorites. This time, the chicken littles were very cold and saturated in old oil, the da vinchi pasta also tasted like fish.

Annie H.,"Orange County, CA",274,184,77,3.0,9/2/2014,"More of a 3.5! Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite ""date night"" places to go eat. Because it is conveniently located at the Spectrum (it's located more near the movie theatre side), I usually come here after shopping. But, because it is located at the Spectrum, do not be surprised if there's a wait for a table. You usually have to wait a good 20 minutes during dining hours. The service is fast and friendly, but might be subpar if your server is super busy.  I always get the Chicken Bellagio which is my favorite dish to get at any Cheesecake Factory, but when I get it here it's really a hit or miss. Sometimes it tastes great and everything is perfect, but sometimes it's too greasy or salty.  One of my all time favorite things is the brown bread here, and I always try to ask for more.  The seating here is roomy, pretty private, and clean. Pretty much the standard for Cheesecake factory!

This is false and completely made up, as most food starts spoiling 4-6 hours after it has reached room temperature. This manager is a total idiot and should be fired. He does not understand basic customer service or basic science. He handled the situation extremely poorly stating a question to me ""are you a doctor?"" Although I am pursuing my PhD, that was completely uncalled for and extremely rude. Not only that, if the order was placed at 10:50 pm, and let's say it takes 10 minutes to make the fettuccine, then it would be done by 11:00pm. I got there at 11:30pm, which means it's been sitting there for 30 minutes not 1 hour like the manager claimed. So he is also a liar.

The food is absolutely horribly prepared.  I fear coming to this location because the food is not predictable and usually really bad.  The chefs here really cannot cook properly.  Sometimes its hit or miss but mostly its a miss.  Its consistently bad compared to other locations. For example, all the chicken dishes are hot and fried and it seems they try, but the overal execution is terrible Compared to other locations.  Too salty,  too much cheese,  Too watery, etc.   There are just always problems.  The chicken romano and chicken dipana are terribly prepared every single time.  They should be embarrassed for how bad it is every single time.   Just to be clear, they try but i think its because most of the chefs at Irvine cant cook that well and have to crank out too many dishes with no line chef making sure the food looks proper to send out. Now much of the staff is very nice and kind and attentive.   I cannot fault the wait staff or reception staff as usually they are very nice and kind. Today We waited over 5 minutes to order an entire cheesecake to go at the entrance and were totally ignored even when an employee came over to prepare desserts.  Unfortunate.  Usually they are really nice and helpful with a smile.  Maybe understaffed for July 4th.

They do a nice job of advertising their lunch menu which gives you smaller portion options and helps you narrow down your list of choices.  As you may know, The Cheesecake Factory menu is long and extensive, which is good for variety and fun to come for dinner with groups.... but for lunch you want something a little more simplified and they do just that with their Lunch menu.   I had the cup of soup, sandwich, and salad option. First of all, I was surprised that I was able to get all 3.  Normally other restaurants provide you with a soup + sandwich or a salad + sandwich.  At The Cheesecake Factory, you get all 3.  Even though it's a lunch option, they don't skimp out on the usual Cheesecake Factory portions.  There was more than enough food for me.   I liked the caesar salad I had and the chicken almond salad sandwich.  The soup was ok, I think it was chicken tortilla but was thicker than I'm used to and I think it felt like there was rice in it and not the crunchy tortilla.  Maybe it was a different soup.  Still, I enjoyed the meal, the portions, service, and price was fair.  I would come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=200

My noodle plate was pretty large, with lots of noodles, but not quite as much chicken and veggies. The noodles were VERY salty, I couldn't had more than a few bites. I told the waitress and she graciously offered to bring me another one or to exchange it. So I opted for the Chicken Da Vinci. By the time the second dish arrived, I was tired so I took a few bites (it was a little too al dente for me but flavor was fine) and asked to take it to go.   The following day I heated up at home and sure enough, the pasta was hard.

The hustle and bustle of all the waiters and people getting up to leave or be seated makes this place very chaotic.  Our waiter was attentive and always filled our waters. He brought us bread twice too! I got the meatloaf, which was delicious!!! Ended up not finishing it (of course), and took it home. My boyfriend ordered the parm chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed.

Came here on a late night getting something to eat with some drinks.  That night, only drinks happened. Got pomegranate mojito which is my favorite. The drinks are perfectly mixed so it's not too strong and not too sweet. I also decided to try another one of their flavored mojito... can't remember the right now.... it's yellow and it's delicious.  Oh, my friend also gotten angle air with shrimp that night. The shrimp are perfectly cooked, fresh and yummy! I only wish we had a few more of those shrimps. The sauce was tomato garlic, which was light but favorable.

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,1/13/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory (CF) location is memorable to me because THIS is where I first tried the gourmet mac and cheese appetizer. My cousin had actually ordered it for her dinner, but it was seriously love at first bite. She prefers no-fuss, no-frills, straight-up mac and cheese (like the no-nonsense Kraft box kind), but I don't mind a little gourmet twist on my mac and cheese (panko crust, bacon bits, you name it). Thus, she wasn't too thrilled about her gourmet mac and cheese (which came in a bowl at that time), but I quickly devoured her leftovers! But I digress. I've only been to this CF location once, when I met some of my family members for dinner, but I remember being served quickly, and this CF restaurant seemed especially clean and nice because it was located in the Spectrum. I think we went for a pretty early dinner on a weeknight, so the eatery wasn't too crowded. The food tasted great, as usual; what we ordered was consistent in taste and flavor and dishes we ordered previously from other CF restaurants.  Here's what I would recommend: ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"": This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top.As mentioned previously, this was actually the first CF restaurant at which I discovered this amazing appetizer dish. It changed my life forever ... in fact, now I often order it as my meal! ""Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake"": This is the BF's go-to and I always manage to get a bite of this cheesecake before he devours it all. Though it's not my favorite--since my favorite candy is Reese's, not Snickers--I would have to say that this cheesecake is in my top 5. It features chunks of the Snickers Bar baked right into the creamy cheesecake and it's topped with fudge and caramel. I also really like this cheesecake because (similar to the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple) it features that crumbly OREO cookie crust. I love chomping on the candy bar bits and the fudge and caramel add the perfect finishing touch to this delectable treat. ""Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip"": Spinach and artichoke dips are probably my favorite appetizer, but TCF changes things up a bit but including crab in its rendition. No joke. This app features a blend of crab, artichokes and cheese served warm with grilled bread. Now, I love spinach, cheese and artichoke dips, but when you throw pieces of fresh crab in there, you take that dip to an entirely different level. I hope this dip is super cheesy--like, filled with gooey, melted cheese--and I can't wait to taste the accompanying grilled bread, too. ""Linda's Fudge Cake"": I always see this colossal cake in the cake display case by the bakery/to-go area, and I always, always wish that I could try it ... but I always get a cheesecake from dessert. However, if I did order something other than cheesecake for my dessert, this is at the top of my must-try list. It features layers of rich chocolate cake and fudge frosting. As a chocoholic, nothing sounds better! This is a straight-up, no-fuss, no-frills chocolate cake. No nuts, almonds, whipped cream or other toppings to get in my way. I'm not sure when, but I do want to indulge in this super chocolaty treat one day. ""Brioche Breakfast Sandwich"":  This breakfast sando features some of my favorite ingredients, making it one of the many items on my must-try list. It includes scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, ham, melted Cheddar cheese and mayo (I would get it without that grilled tomato) in between slices of grilled brioche bread. It also comes served with potatoes. I've never had TCF's potatoes yet, but I'm sure it comes with plenty of savory flavor and just enough salty taste. This breakfast sandwich sounds absolutely stellar with all those components ... I might just lapse into a food coma after partaking in this savory feast. Definitely an entrée I would want to get if I were in the mood for something savory to kick off the day. ""Monte Cristo Sandwich"": If I ever go to TCF for breakfast again, this is what I would want to try. It's not every day that you find a restaurant with Monte Cristo on the menu! This version features crunchy French toast that's stuffed with bacon, grilled ham, melted Swiss cheese and grilled ham. It's then dusted with powdered sugar and served with strawberry preserves. I don't care much about the strawberry component of this dish, but just reading the menu description already has me drooling. I haven't had a Monte Cristo with all of these components--usually it's with ham, cheese, the thick egg bread and powdered sugar--but because there's bacon and scrambled eggs in this version, I'm definitely looking forward to trying it one day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=240
Andrew D.,"Tustin, CA",33,46,278,4.0,1/3/2015,"It has been about a year since the last time I went to this Cheesecake Factory. About this time last year, I took my wife there for her birthday dinner. Without going into too much details about that visit, it was a disaster. Our waiter completely forgot about us and essentially ruined my wife's dinner.  So, yesterday was once again my wife's birthday and I wanted to take her out for dinner. This is an important birthday, it's my wife's 30th. She got a giftcard for Cheesecake Factory for Christmas and she decided that we should give this location another shot.  I walked into this trip with a very critical eye. I was not about to let anyone ruin this birthday for my wife. Once we were seated I started paying attention to all the details that matter (how long does it take to be greeted, are our drinks refilled, etc...).  After waiting less than 30 minutes to be seated, which was fantastic for a Friday night, we were seated and our waitress Brittani came over very quickly and got our drink order. Here's what made me know this was going to be a great trip, upon looking at my wife's ID, Brittani noticed that it was in fact my wife's birthday and wished her a happy one. Major points! We ordered dinner soon after and it came out pretty quickly. She ordered her favorite item on the menu, the Chickeb Bellagio. I changed things up and ordered the Hibachi Steak. It was awesome. Delicious mashed potatoes with a wasabi butter. The steak was great and cooked perfectly.  Of course, we ended the night by sharing a slice of cheesecake. Brittani in all her fantastic insight, brought a few coworkers with her to deliver the dessert. They sang happy birthday to my wife, which, while typical for a restaurant, meant a lot to me, considering how rough things were last year.  The only thing I can complain about was that one of the napkins on our table was stained with lipstick. It was a little gross, but they replaced it for us.  Overall, a very fantastic trip and we will be back for sure. Much sooner this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=240

Angelena G.,"Orange County, CA",43,79,43,3.0,3/2/2016,"I usually enjoy TCF very much. This night, my service was great but the food was far from it. Our order came out after a long while, a looong while. But the server was attentive throughout, and very friendly. The chicken Madeira was brought out first, with a smile. Delicious as usual. A few minutes later, the turkey avocado sandwich, not by our server, was slid in front of me with such force that the sandwich slid across the plate, no smile, no ""Here ya go"", nothing. And the bread could have been a cornerstone in the house I dream of building one day. I couldn't even tear it, it barely bent. You know the way a bun looks if you microwave it? It gets wrinkled and shrunken. It was doused in some butter flavored something. Yuck. They took it back, with apologies, and very quickly brought out another. Very quickly. The bacon was less on the 2nd 'wich, but the bread was softer. Still microwaved. A mom knows microwaved bread. NOT toasted as the description tells. Still drenched in ""butter"" flavor. I couldn't eat it. Just completely disappointed. The manager gave us a free dessert. Thanks, unbeknownst to him it is my birthday, so that was something. I think this is my first food let down at TCF in the 10 years + we've been diners. The food is always good, and we've been in FL, NC, and all over SoCal. Blah. Lemon drop martini and mojito were on point though. But not good enough that I don't miss having dinner tonight. I brought it home thinking one of my kids would like it. Nah. Waste of twelve dollars.

However, once seated we waited nearly 20 minutes before anyone stopped at our table to offer us water. We finally had a server arrive who apologized and stated that there was a mix up in servers assigned to our table. We ordered an appetizer and our entrees. Our appetizer finally makes it to our table and we meet our new server. Nothing against our new server, David, as he did his best to provide great customer service. After an hour of waiting patiently, our entrees finally arrive. Unfortunately, there was a mix up in the kitchen with one of our entrees, lack of sauce for the rest and an incompetent manager that brought us to the worse dinner experience ever at a Cheesecake Factory. After an additional 30 minute wait on the corrected entree, our server apologized yet again and said he would send the manager over to help address not only the service provided or lack thereof as well as issues with our entrees. The manager arrives at our table and only addresses our friend who encountered the entree issue. She leaves without bothering to ask the table how everyone's dinner was and overall experience was. Shall I add, this manager Jamie Mattera does not provide an introduction. I only learned of her name when I asked for Cheesecake Factory's corporate number. Not once does she ask what she can do to resolve the obvious. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location, as not only was the service poor but the food was not the normal quality you receive at a Cheesecake Factory.

We asked the difference and the waiter made him read the description on the menu. Neither of us found a difference so we went with the 'old fashioned' because it was a dollar cheaper. Sadly they burnt his patty to a crisp...guess that's why they took so long to bring out the food. Would not go to this location again, especially with so many other great food options at the Irvine Spectrum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=100

Eileen T.,"Fullerton, CA",300,201,1504,1.0,1/25/2016,"I had the shrimp scampi. This dish should not be called shrimp scampi. The shrimp was fried, dry, and lack flavor. It came with angel hair pasta and no sauce. Husband ordered rib-eye. The dish arrived probably 20 minutes after I had my dish. I was almost done with my shrimp already. Bread basket was also brought at this point. The rib eye was edible because it was too salty. We sent it back to the kitchen. The waiter said that the kitchen told him they made the sauce too salty, and offered to make us another one without the sauce. We waited for another 20 minutes for the steak. This time the steak had no sauce, and also no seasoning. No salt. No pepper. Nothing. Just a piece of grilled beef. Good that we have salt and pepper on the table to season it ourselves. Very disappointed at our dinner experience. So disappointed that we didn't even have cheesecake and just left. :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=100
Joshua S.,"San Diego, CA",198,486,234,2.0,7/10/2016,"So we are typically huge fans of the Cheesecake Factory. It's usually a go-to, although the Yard House is unbeatable IMO, but this Cheesecake has been subpar at best the four times we've been here.  The only reason I'm doing 2-stars versus a 1 is because we did have a semi-okay experience dining at the indoor bar side a few weeks ago. Service was okay, nothing to write home about, but the drinks were good and the food came out correct.  This review is based mainly on their new outdoor bar area. Been there three times in the last 1.5 weeks hoping it would be better each time and taking into consideration that it was new and might have some speed bumps.  The first time we weren't impressed. Service was s-l-O-w and the bar wasn't even busy. It seemed like a lot of confusion amongst the bartenders and servers. We had two drinks a piece but we waited for the second. Nobody thanked us for coming in, which is annoying when you pay over $45 for 4 drinks. We chalked it up as a bad night.  Went back a few nights ago hoping for a better experience. The bartender gal didn't seem to have much enthusiasm for being there as we were not greeted professionally and the drinks took a while. We left after we drank it. Main reason was it was super slow and the bartenders couldn't even check on us as we wanted to order another one. Too many places next door to have to wait for a bartender when they are standing around talking.  Last night did it for us. I posted a couple pics of food that just sat forever. It was disgusting. The bartenders couldn't not see it, the food runner saw it because he brought food out a couple times, and nobody bussed it. It was nasty. First off, we had to slide our bar stools down because nobody apparently bussed the dinner from whoever left the bar before us. That food sat there about ten mins after we got drinks also as the bartenders seemingly didn't care. I could see if it was slammed and nobody had time but that was far from the case. Anyways, what was tacky was my GF heard one of the bartenders say how the bar wasn't built properly and we could tell people were annoyed with probably how cramped it is back there. Then, the icing for us was this food and pineapple left by the departing guests prior to is sitting down. It sat so long literally about 40 mins. Eventually a bartender came around and took some of it but left a half a slice of pineapple between us and in front of new guests that sat down. They never came back. Long story short, the service literally sucked, the bar was filthy, and nobody cared enough to clean it up. My drink menu was sat down on top of crumbs that I had to blow away. Yuck. All that and hearing workers complain was enough for me.  Probably the last time we spend money there. Might try the indoor side again sometime but it will be a while. It's a shame because the outdoor space is cool but the service doesn't match.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=100

We did not finish our drinks, then the food, my husbands potstickers were soggy and over salted. The arugula on my salad was wilted and staring to rot, so I moved on to my chicken lettuce wraps, the chicken tastes old and was chewy, the salsa that came with the lettuce wraps was inedible like ketchup mixed with sour cream and red chili flakes.

Then she was relieved by another server--Alicia, I think--who just wasn't up to snuff. Our food took much longer than usual to come out. I ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano, a popular specialty they have. Apparently, my order was served to another table by accident. A supervisor actually came by and apologized, which I appreciated. I wish more restaurants would this. It actually matters. Frustrating, in any event, when a restaurant bungles the basics.

Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1368,948,3941,3.0,3/24/2013,"DisapPOINted. (Kevin Kline in ""Fish Called Wanda"")  I have been to most of the Cheesecake Factory locations and this is not one of the best.  Love the interior, love the location, but the food has gone downhill. One caveat:  the appetizers are KILLER.  Next time that's all I'm eating. The Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes are so yummy that I could eat them every day for a month.  They melt in your mouth and the mixture of flavors is just simply heavenly.  We also had the crab and artichoke dip but it was waaay too fatty creamy.  Tasted good though, served with little pieces of toasted crispy bread. For the main course, Diane had the Cobb Salad.  It was your typical Cobb salad, with the chicken, avo, egg, greens, etc.  She liked it, nothing to write home about.  I ordered the Taco Salad. When it arrived I sat and looked at it.  Then I picked at it a little to see what was under the top lettuce. Not much.  Then I called the server and sent it back and ordered Chicken Marsala. Problem is, what I meant to order was Chicken Madeira, the best selling dish at CCF.  The chicken marsala was much less satisfying and I left most of it.  It was just the chicken on a bed of bow tie pasta.  But it was m,y fault that I ordered the wrong thing so I just contented myself with one piece of chicken (3 pieces of boneless skinless in all), and a big piece of cheesecake! We both got the Original Cheesecake.  I'm always hoping for cheesecake like I used to eat at the old Stage Deli in New York, had been going there since I was a kid until they closed.  But nothing compares.  The Original Cheesecake used to be really good:  a solid cheesecake with a big layer of sour cream on the top.  The inside part is now too mooshy, and the layer of sour cream is miniscule.  And the graham cracker crust doesn't taste as good either. Sheesh.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.  But I'll be back because this is a great meeting place and has a vibrant atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=280

We were seated on the patio. It took the waitress some time to come and see us, and when she did she was a little bit off. I am not sure if she was new or what was going on. I asked for a recommendation on a drink and she basically couldn't give me one. I ordered a small bite salad and the buffalo blasts and a glass of moscato. My friend had a Caesar salad. She got her drink and I never got my wine. By the time I was half way though the meal we also had not gotten any refills on water. She didn't come back until the end of the meal when we had to ask for more water.  Also with the buffalo blasts, it was like they weren't cooked right and in the frying process all of the chicken inside about half of them had fallen out because there was. I filling in them. It almost seems as though the cooks knew that was there case because there were big holes in the wonton, but they were turned upside down on the plate so you wouldn't notice until you picked it up. To make matters worse because the centers were kind of wet they stuck to the napkin that they had put on the bottom of the plate.

Nina Q.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,11,5,1.0,9/18/2016,"Went out with my mom friends last Saturday for an early dinner and movie night. We rarely have a night out without kids so we wanted it to be a fun night for us all. We decided to go early (4:30pm) and have dinner and drinks at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated right away, at that point I thought that we were lucky because there wasn't  a lot of people in the restaurant. The server took our drink orders, and the drinks came out just in time, then our server came back to bring our bread and to get our orders- Chicken Bellagio, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Chicken Salad Sandwich with fruit. My girlfriends and I were chatting away when I noticed that the server brought the food of the people in the other table that were seated about 20 minutes after us. My friends and I realized that we have been sitting for well over 45 MINUTES already WITHOUT OUR FOOD. The SERVER DIDN'T COME BY OUR TABLE TO CHECK ON US though she had passed our table a number of times. My friend flagged down another server to ask where our food was, a few minutes later our server came by and said that she was sorry but she FORGOT TO PUT IN THE ORDER and that she told the kitchen to expedite our order so our food should come out soon. Another 20 MINUTES PASSED and our SERVER kept on PASSING OUR TABLE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. My friend flagged the server and asked how long our food will take, she said it should come out soon. A few minutes later a runner came out with a plate of sandwich and brought it to our table- IT WAS THE WRONG SANDWICH. Another runner brought the rest of our orders- but no chicken salad sandwich. Our SERVER PASSED THE TABLE ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT STOPPING AT OUR TABLE, my friend called her and asked where our other friend's sandwich was, the server casually said ""OH, I PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON AND ORDERED THE WRONG SANDWICH instead of chicken salad sandwich, they're making it now""- NO APOLOGY WHATSOEVER! This was the 2nd TIME SHE MADE A MISTAKE AND DIDN'T APPEAR REMORSEFUL- DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE. At that point my friend got up and talked to the manager, the manager came by our table and apologized- she didn't know what was going on because the server didn't say anything to her except that she had to key in a code for a change order: Cuban sandwich to chicken salad sandwich. The server didn't even say that it was her fault. The manager offered us free dessert and said that she would come by again to check on us. At that point we were all pissed and had lost our appetite. Our supposedly fun night was ruined! We had a movie to catch so we had to go quickly. Our server came by with the dessert menu- no apology, no nothing- we declined the free dessert since we had to go straight to the movies. We asked for our check- the manager didn't come back.

Syeda S.,"Irvine, CA",11,14,10,1.0,10/7/2015,"We've been loyal Cheesecake Factory customers for 15+ years but since our last experience I or my family will never be going there again! My husband I came here with our 8yr old and 2 yr old for dinner on 8/28/15. After the usual weekend 30 min+ wait we were seated. We ordered our food...I ordered a burger, my husband ordered pasta and for the kids we ordered the chicken madeira to share. We finished our food but the kids weren't that hungry so we had to get their chicken madeira to go. The next morning my son warmed up the left overs and began eating. As he bit into a bite he felt something hard and spit it out. I was absolutely horrified to see a metal screw come out of his mouth! Not a hair, or a dead bug or something gross but something physically DANGEROUS that could have ended very badly. Right away everyone stopped eating and I was so relieved I wasn't feeding that to my 2 yr old because I dont even want to think what could have happened if she'd been the one with that bite. Of,course I called them right away and was given Mike Macias (Manager) information. I spoke with him in a very civil and calm manner- I did not lay blame on him or did not disrespect him in any way. He wanted me to send him pictures and an email explaining everything, which my husband sent. After he saw the pictures he called my husband and spoke to him about investigating the problem He said he will look into how a screw got into our food and will send us a gift card to compensate us for the chicken madeira.  It's been well over a month and we have yet to receive any update regarding the issue- no follow up email, phone call, no gift card...nothing. Clearly loyal customers mean nothing to them.  It's not even care about the money or the gift card because we will not be eating there again so I don't need your gift card. If anything I'd want to get a refund back to my card. But the reason why I'm so upset is because they dont have the courtesy to even call or email a loyal customer to follow up after such a disturbing ordeal. If you have young kids and you decide to come here for dinner make sure you're paying attention to whats going in their mouths. I cringe every time I think about that disgusting screw ending up in my 2 yr old daughters mouth.

We came in at around 5 pm and we still had to wait a while before we could get a seat. My favorite thing here is always the brown bread... absolutely amazing but it's pretty bad when you're favorite thing at a restaurant is the starter bread.  I wanted to try something different this time and so I got the eggplant sandwich, which was pretty big and filling but lacking in many ways. It would have been so much better if they put the sandwich on a ciabatta or a bread roll but instead they put it on a hamburger bun. And I basically had to eat also eat it with a knife and fork since everything just fell out of the sandwich with the first bite I took. Only the melted cheese was actually holding the contents of the sandwich together. I ended up full though, but not satisfied. Again the bread was awesome, my main course, not so much.

My food was delicious but my boyfriend did not got full lol he's a big guy but he said it was delicious as well. My only complaint would be that our waitress never checked up on us and only refilled our drinks once. They weren't busy so idk why she couldn't check on us more often.

In the back of the extensive book-like menu are two pages of cheesecake options. I didn't count but I would guess there were 50 choices. I had the key lime cheesecake. Ala mode. It tasted like key lime and I ate every bite. Except for the whipped cream. I'm not a big whipped cream fan so the two giant blobs they put on it were mostly left on the plate.

I came about 15 minutes after she was already seated and as I arrive she had told me that not one person had come up to her. I thought maybe they were just waiting until I came to get the drink orders; boy was I wrong. Another 5 minutes goes by and still no one comes by asking for drinks or to give us bread until a gentlemen came by finally asking for our drinks. We get our drinks and appetizers in until finally our actual waiter arrives, Christophe letting us know our appetizers are in. Another 10 minutes goes by, our calamari is out but we still hadn't even had our entree orders in. Finally, he takes our orders and the food comes out. He checks up on us at most twice. Firstly, I had asked for the avocado sauce to my salad on the side, but he misunderstood and charged me for a side of avocado. Secondly, he didn't mention that an up-charge for ahi Tuna was going to be $10. Even though they want it added you should let a customer know how much an additional charge is going to be.

There was mixture of chocolate chips inside the cookie dough filling that made it taste absolutely balanced. The crust was made out of a thin layer of dark/milk chocolate and it added an extra kick of chocolate. The whipped creamed was also sprinkled with chocolate chips. This is probably one of my favorite cheesecakes I have tried at the Cheesecake Factory. Highly recommend to anyone who loves a chocolate chips cookies and cheesecake. It's a perfect combination.

Katriona M.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,20,31,3.0,5/20/2014,"Ehh. Okay. Meh.  Those were the words that basically summed up my evening (and 5 others) at the Cheesecake Factory yesterday night. Let's note, that this happened during Monday night. Monday. It wasn't busy nor was it hustlin' and bustlin'. Had a group of 6 (plus a child) and waited about 10 minutes for a table, which is fine, I checked out the cheesecake selection at the bakery area.  Food was okay. Drinks were okay. Nothing spectacular. Had a very extensive menu but I just wish they would focus on something and make it GOOD. They have too many cultural items on their menu but they do not get the flavors right.  Appetizers: Factory Nachos, Fried Calamari, and Thai Lettuce Wraps. Nachos were pretty good actually, I love that the chips that were soaked in the toppings were crispy and crunchy instead of soggy from the cheese/sour cream/pico de gallo/guacamole. The chicken that was supposed to be in the nachos was nonexistent. Fried Calamari was weak. The sauces felt like they came out of a squeeze packet you get from a fast food joint, the amount of calamari was so little, and the breading had a weird and really bitter bitter aftertaste.  Thai lettuce wraps were okay. Liked the chicken.  Everyone ordered their own stuff, from Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane to Rib Eye and Herb Crusted Salmon. All I can say was the steak was okay, but the rest of the entrees was MEH. My herb crusted Salmon was gross, it was like too sweet and too lemony from the sauce. I didn't even finish it. And seriously the shrimp scampi? That was a pathetic excuse of an Italian dish. But then again, it is the cheesecake factory so we did know what we were going into when we entered.  Waitress was good, she was really nice and had good customer service. Decent, and went by our tables enough times.  Tiramisu cheesecake is nasty.

Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Fried Zucchini, Stuffed Mushrooms, Ahi Tartar (good but so small), Bistro Shrimp Pasta (so bad in calories), and Fish Tacos (change the sides). Other items are so bland and not worth the money. You know you can't go wrong with there desserts, especially the Limoncello Torte = my fave!  Staff is always different.

My work is around here so my family and I would always come here and up until now, we were always super pleased with the customer service and food. However, after today we will not be coming here anymore. Firstly, our food was taking so long to come out that the table next to us (who sat down AFTER us) was already finished with their food. We pointed this out to our server, a guy named Christopher and after that, he was super rude and completely ignored us the entire night. His attitude towards us was so bad that the table next to us even noticed. We tried to ask for some sauce for my food and of course, he didn't bring it until we asked again. By this point the table next to us kindly asked their waiter for some sauce for my food because they noticed Christopher was completely ignoring us. They even joked that by the time we get our sauce it would be Christmas already. He ignored us until the end and didn't even bring us our check. And it's not because he forgot either, he intentionally ignored us and served all the tables around us, except us. And when we tried to get his attention, he shut us down telling us ""i'm talking to another customer.""  I really hope this restaurant does something about this because having a server like him is not going to help their business at all.

(actually, about 2 minutes before they called our names). It's been awhile since the both of us have been here but we both knew the menu would be a small novel. I was craving a burger so I got the mushroom burger with regular fries. The burger was pretty decent - loaded with different kinds of mushrooms and a healthy serving of cheese on top. It would've tasted better if it was ""juicier"" and had some type of mayo/chiptole sauce in it - that would've put it over the top! The fries were nothing special but not bad either.

The most recent visit was after we left another restaurant and we were much happier with the food here.  We waited about 5 minutes to be seated outside and our drink orders were taken.  Our server brought the drinks back, some bread and took our orders.  The Strawberry Lemonade is very good and they have an excellent ratio of flavoriing to lemonade. We ordered an appetizer of Buffalo Blasts, the wife ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak and I ordered the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club. The bread was warm and there is a sourdough and grain bread.  The appetizer came a short time later and was outstanding.  Buffalo Blasts are like deep fried wontons filled with chicken breast and bleu cheese dressing and buffalo sauce for dipping.  It is also a huge portion, 8 large wontons which we came no where near finishing. Our dinner came a short time later and my wife's steak was okay.  It was a little over cooked and looked a little tough to me.  The mashed potatoes were okay as well, but my wife is not a fan of red potatoes.  I loved my club, it had plenty of shrimp and bacon in it and again was a huge portion. For dessert, we shared the cheesecake on special, the Hershey Chocolate Bar Cheesecake with Creamy Chocolate Frosting and Chocolate Chips. A quarter from the sale of each slice will be donated to Feeding America, the nation's leading domestic hunger relief charity.  Talk about chocolate overload! Finally, our server Morgan was very friendly and engaging.  She checked on us several times and spent time to talk to us during the meal, even though her tables were busy.  We would probably come here more often, but Chief isn't allowed in the outside eating area, so this limits our visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=440

Party was starting in 30 min at this point ( he waited 45 min) , so they scrambled to make the food.  And they offered a 25% discount which was okay, but they could have done more.  The food was fine, people enjoyed the party, and now that I look at the receipt I realized that they didn't charge us for the party package, but a la carte!  My husband didn't know it was a specific package.  So we ended up with more food than we needed and got a discount,  but it was not what the order was supposed to be even after they found it on the desk!         I will probably never cater from them again, and would not recommend it to anyone.  The catering orders are not computerized so if you do it, I would call and call again to make sure they are literally cooking it right before you need it.   Party hosting is stressful enough, and I didn't need to be worried that I needed to delivery order pizza for my guests.   Seriously did not live up to my expectations at all.  I have ordered from other restaurants for parties ( I have three kids and never had a problem like this).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=440

A B.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,1,1.0,4/1/2016,"Very rarely do I take time out of my busy life to write a bad review about a place but my experience here was just so unprofessional and unacceptable I knew it had to be heard. Went to this Cheesecake Factory branch at the Spectrum a couple months ago with my family and a guest. Everything started out fine (if you forget about the ~45 minute wait after we got seated to actually get our food to us.... keep in mind it was pretty late at night and the restaurant was half empty). When our food did come to us (finally), that's when all the shit went down. For starters, you could totally tell the food was cold and not fresh. The worst part was when our waiter brought us our drinks, THERE WAS GUNK ON THE FREAKING CUP. LIKE SERIOUSLY?? YOU HAD ONE JOB. The glass had some disgusting brown ish on the inside of the glass (probably some leftover chocolate shake I imagine) but how could they have missed that?! And how disrespectful of them to just go along with it and serve it to a customer and not even care that it's there? It's not like they didn't see it.. it was pretty damn noticeable. Honestly, the cold food wasn't a huge problem, I get it, it's late and they all want to go home, whatever. I could care less if it wasn't 5-star quality dining. But that cup was disgusting!! And when I called over the waiter, he had the most smug, rude smile on his face and he laughed in our faces when I told him that about the situation. Then I asked him to bring the manager and he did, and I told him we are going to leave because of the disrespectful treatment we got from our waiter, along with our Albertsons frozen food lookin meals and disgusting, unwashed cup. He even made us PAY for the food. WE DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THE FOOD AND WE TOOK LIKE TWO SIPS OF THE DRINK BEFORE SEEING THE GUNK INSIDE THE CUP. Very inconsiderate, rude, unprofessional workers and service. Do not go here unless you are looking for an hour-long migraine and food poisoning. 0/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Anyways we paid and we bounced. We then headed to BJ's at the Tustin Marketplace and had an amazing experience there as per usual. Great quality food and quality people.

In the past, almost every visit starts with us asking for a lemon wedge so we can properly clean and disinfect the filthy, under-washed silverware. Today, in addition to that, my eggplant parmesan dish was under-cooked. It literally tasted and chewed like a hockey puck. They were re-doing it for 16 minutes. My wife was forced to eat her dish alone, and I lost my appetite completely. My wife and I were sitting in front of dirty dishes for another 11 minutes awaiting a manager.

Food is comparable to all other locations, although service can be subpar at times. I don't blame them at times though, as it's always busy and I can't imagine waiting on so many different people at all times. One of the things I frequently get here are the pizzas. It's made for 1, but CF standards, it's at least 2. Lucky for me, I love leftover pizza! Also, I love dipping it in their ranch sauce. One of the best I've had.

The dim lighting, the decorative walls, and the colors makes me feel any meal here is a celebration. We finally visited for Sunday brunch. Although we arrived soon after opening, I was disappointed that we passed several bright-and-open window tables; we were, instead, seated at one of the 2 dull booths with a view of the door leading to the restroom (my error; I should've made my request earlier). As if our seating location wasn't enough of a disappoitment, the table exuded a rank smell of stale sponge/rag -- so unpleasant. I've detected that disagreeable smell at some fast-food counters, but didn't expect it here. Thankfully, the seating location and the smell was eased by the fact that we had a very sweet and pleasant server; in addition, the food was delightful, attractive, and generous (no room for dessert this visit).

The other star off was for: 2) the main thing that bothered me was when we got served the food. My son is 4 1/2 and ordered Mac & cheese (shocker!) It's usually good and appeases his appetite.

I get that they wanna serve it hot to the customers... But not scalding hot to a child! My son couldn't eat it for several minutes. I had to keep stirring the dish & blowing on each spoonful to cool it down. Pretty annoying and quite dangerous when being served to a child!

Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1451,2370,6598,4.0,7/25/2011,"I had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in the Irvine Spectrum last week with a friend and had a great time.   The place is really nice and it was quite crowded, especially for a Tuesday night.  I was seated relatively quickly (considering it's cheesecake factory).  We sat in the back in the round domed area.  Our waitress was really sweet and kept bringing out bread and butter.  She also was really nice about giving us a lot of time to order and was patient.   I ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta and it was delicious.  It had chicken and shrimp and had lots of cajun spices.  It was extremely filling and I actually had to take half of it home, which became a wonderful breakfast for the morning after. What I've noticed is that, as I'm sure is the case with many other restaurants, their ""healthiest/lower-calorie"" foods are the most expensive.  Believe it or not, the cajun jambalaya I ordered was one of the lowest-calorie items listed under the specialty pasta section of their nutrition menu.     In all, this place was really nice. One thing, though, is that the floor was really slippery in one area and I almost slipped and fell so I told the nearest employee there about it and asked if he could do something about it so that others wouldn't fall but he just stood there and stared and gave me an attitude... it was pretty weird.  Honestly, he should want to clean that up because the restaurant could be sued if someone slipped and fell.  Trust me, one does not need to take Torts to know that much.   In all, this place is cute and my friend really enjoyed celebrating her birthday here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=520

John N.,"Austin, TX",349,488,182,4.0,3/27/2013,"If you go to one Cheesecake Factory, you have been to all of them.  Keep in mind though that experiences DO vary from location to location, particularly in the service or seating department. The food, of course, is like all the other Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Very flavorable, large, and unhealthy portions, with the exception of the skinny menu.  The bigger difference with this location is the seating.  At this location you have your outdoor seating semi overlooking the valet parking area out towards another restaurant.  For larger parties, there is seating towards the inside of the restaurant near the restrooms.  Thank goodness.  Service from what I can remember was friendly, which I'm surprised how many different Cheesecake Factory restaurants keep up.  Very impressive.

Yes, they have a ton of items on their menu, which generally means one thing (no, not which to choose) -- they all pretty much suck.  We met a friend here on a Sunday afternoon, it was busy, but not ridiculous. We waited a few minutes to be seated, and when they took us back the table was still dirty from the previous diners. They apologized and we waited a few more minutes while they cleared the table. That was not really a problem for me. What was the problem was the floor near our table was so greasy my shoes slipped around as I walked. I ordered a tostada salad that was mostly lettuce and rather bland while my wife had a Chinese chicken salad. Both are pretty standard fare. Nothing particularly good or bad.  The server was fine. She checked in on us and kept the glasses full.  We decided to use the restrooms before we left, which was a mistake. They were pretty gross. Paper everywhere, trash cans overflowing--a general uncleanliness.  I guess my biggest gripe is that this place just didn't seem clean. And if it's not clean in the places where customers CAN see, I would hate to imagine what goes on where we can't see.

Jason L.,"Irvine, CA",1322,421,241,3.0,5/18/2010,"MMMm Cheesecake Factory. My first experience was in SF on the 7th floor of Macy's. It was a super fancy restaurant to me. Plus I had a $100 gift card so it was fun trying to use it up with a few friends. However... Cheesecake Factory is like a BMW (which I'm not a fan of). A lot of people hear the name and think WOW Cheesecake Factory. Just like a BMW, a lot of people are more in love with name than with the car. Sometimes a brand name does not mean its better. There is a great varied of food here with large portions. I've tried everything from Jambalaya, pizza, pasta, steak, burgers, and other fine entrees. Every item was delicious a bit pricey, but given the quality and size makes it worth it. The Irvine location always has a long wait, but is a great place to lounge with friends or celebrate a birthday. One problem... you CAN have too much of a good thing. There are lot of fruity cocktail drinks and great meals, but after a while its all the same thing without any change to the menu. I forgot! They actually have Cheesecake!! Not a big fan of cheesecake, but most of the time after consuming some 5,000 calorie it is hard to have room left for cheesecake. Its a great idea to share with a friend or many friends. Overall rating about 3 to 3.5 ish stars. If you asked me about 5 or more years ago, Cheesecake factory would have about 4 or 5 stars, but not anymore. Now living in south OC, there are more Cheesecake Factories than McDonald's in this area. Yes, I dare you to check. CF was once a fancy restaurant that you go to, but now its as common as Denny's. In underdeveloped areas shopping malls are considered ""fancy"" because they have CF or PF Chang's. I am a bit sad that there are too many chain restaurants.

This is a popular place so there can be a wait.  I recommend going in a half an hour early and put your name in, then you can cruise the Spectrum and get extra hungry.  You're going to need to be.  The Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu and the portions are huge.  There is a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and just perusing the menu can take some time.  I love the chicken littles and the bbq ranch chicken salad and the navajo (a chicken sandwich).   Once you're order is taken, your drinks arrive, along with a bread basket with real butter.  The breads are sourdough and a type of squaw.  Both are always warm and tasty and you can always get more.  I do wish the butter wasn't so hard, but here is a tip:  it's in wrapped pats and you gently squeeze the sides and the warmth of your hands translates to the butter and it softens, so you are able to open it and spread on your warm bread. Sunday brunch, how about lemon ricotta pancakes or sunrise fiesta burrito? The appetizers, small plates and snacks are pages and you can order 3 or 4 of those and split it all and get to taste test a lot of different items.  I really like the buffalo blasts. Did I mention dessert?  Cheesecake galore.  Pretty much if you can dream it, it's there.  We split and tried the Hershey chocolate bar cheesecake and it was divine, although the chocolate infusion was on overload, so you really need to love chocolate!  Not a problem, I do!  25 cents of each slice of this cheesecake is donated to Feeding America, so you're doing good deeds too!  Does it get better than eating good and doing good?  Nope. Warning, you need to like leftovers!  The Cheesecake Factory has huge portions and taking home food is just part of the experience.  Certain items, think salad, really do not survive the transition well.  Luckily, you can get a cheaper lunch size portion of salads, and a few other items.  Did I mention that even the lunch size portion is big?  It is!  No salad in/on some small bowl/plate.  You will still have plenty to eat. I've found staff to usually be helpful and friendly and management wants to please.  Any time I've had an issue, it's been addressed and fixed.  I love the decor of Cheesecake Factory.  Brighter color swirls and modern fixtures.  I personally do not like the booths, as they backs are almost completely straight up, not the most comfy in my opinion, so I usually opt for a chair. Overall, I'm definitely a fan and this is one of the few chains that I really like a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=560

Gary B.,"Irvine, CA",72,124,27,3.0,3/10/2015,"I really had to take a couple of days before posting a review for my experience, because quite frankly I was a bit confused as to how I was going to express my views. It was early evening and there was a slight chill in the air, but my wife and I decided to sit outdoors because it was pretty busy indoors and they had heaters on the patio. After being seated and receiving our drinks, some women were seated at the table next to us. Immediately after sitting down they asked the waiter to turn off the heat. Well the heater was being mutually shared by their table and ours. So do you think that the waiter bothered to ask if we would be ok with it being turned off, especially since we were seated first? NOPE! Anyway I sucked it up and went back to being chilly. So while ordering I jumped on the Fish and chips while my wife was being a bit more indecisive. She asked if she could possible get an Angel Hair Pasta with Marinara Sauce and Chicken. He replied by informing her that they had Angel Hair with Shrimp. She was insistent on what she wanted so he went to ask the Chef if they could do it. After taking forever he came back with an affirmative answer so my wife ordered it.  Being busy we figured it would take some tie to get our food and it did.  As we started eating I noticed my wife playing with her food. Now if you were to ever have dinner with us, you would soon discover that my wife never messes around and is always finished twice as fast as I am. Anyway, I asked what was wrong and she told me that the sauce was so spicy that she couldn't eat it. So I called our waiter over and explained that this wasn't the Marinara she asked for. After 3 or 4 ""Are you sure?"" comments he took it to the Chef in an attempt to have it done right the second time around. All the while I'm sitting there picking at my fish, but more about that later. 2 or 3 minutes later our waiter comes back with a saucer of Marinara Sauce and asks my wife if this would work. She tasted it and said that will be fine. Instead of taking her at her word he kept insisting on making sure. ""Are you sure?"" ""Are you really sure?"" ""Are you REALLY sure?"" ""We doing want to have to repeat this."" Of course by this time the people around us were captivated by the conversation taking place between my wife and our waiter. Back to my plate, I have Fish & Chips all of the time so I'm smart enough to know that I will find a small bone from time to time. This time was different. Rarely if ever have I bit into a piece of fish and had a bone be so thick that it pierced the roof of my mouth. There were so many bones that after picking through the first 2 pieces I gave up and left the rest. The bed of fries underneath the fish did a better job of playing fish with all of the grease they soaked up that I ate some of those instead. When it was all said and done, the $50.00 plus that we spent on this eating experience might have been better spent on a Filet-o-Fish sandwich snuck into a movie. I give this review only because I believe the waiters intentions were good. Yes he got a tip. Gary",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=400

I ordered the crabcake sandwich which was okay, a little mushy, it needed texture. Maybe a raw red onion or something. But I felt like an old person eating this dish. The other dish we ordered was the pulled pork sandwich, that was disgusting. The bbq sauce tasted like it had a lot of pineapple in it. However, both had french fries and those were decent. To top it all off we got the 30th anniversary cheesecake. Chocolate and cheesecake. Good, but you couldn't really only taste the chocolate, it overwhelmed cheesecake.  Several children, many many high school kids and three birthday parties just to give you an idea of setting. Our waitress was nice however new, her suggestions were not good.

Dave L.,"Irvine, CA",529,100,62,4.0,2/17/2014,"I""m a fan of the Cheesecake Factory because it's solid in all three areas: decor, service, and food quality. The restaurant is massive with a very nice outdoor seating patio.  Inside are booths and three separate rooms. All are with high ceilings and nicely decorated.  The service is consistently good and professional. The menu is huge, but they do have a lighter side menu that offers smaller portions with an emphasis on healthy choices. You can order straight American fair or Asian or even Latin choices. It's all there for you to choose from.  The food is quality and reasonably priced. My favorite is the Cuban sandwich, but there are a lot of other good choices. The iced tea is five star excellent, served in large glasses with free refills the way it should be.  Here are the pros and cons: Pros:  1. Tons of food choices including breakfast burritos all day long. 2. Iced tea is delicious  3. Great place to people watch (Spectrum) 4. Huge portions  5. Cheesecake heaven 6. Great service and good food 7. Reasonably prices Cons: 1. We usually have to wait to sit down.  2. Back room is kind of dark with no window and that's why I prefer to sit in front.

The best part of the burger was definitely the fried mac and cheese - but interestingly, when it was paired with the rest of the burger the flavors were lost.  It was only when bits of it fell onto my plate and I ate them separately that I was able to taste it properly.  The meat was lacking flavor.  The veggies were pedestrian.  The fries were good, but not outstanding.   The best part (or possibly worst, depending your stance in the War of the Ring) is having the Eye of Sauron looking over your shoulder at all times.  Don't get what I'm talking about?  Eat at cheesecake factory and look around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=460

Always gotta get the [Fried Zucchini] when you go to the Cheesecake Factory! It's a good small snack. 2. The [Loaded Potato Tots] is definitely something different. It has a strong bacon taste so if you don't like bacon, this is not for you. But, nonetheless, this small snack is also extremely good. 3. The [Cuban Rolls] look exactly like egg rolls, just Cuban style on the inside. It's also a pretty good small snack if you're not too hungry. 4. The [Chicken Bellagio] was the most disappointing. Although the crusted chicken and arugula salad were delicious, the basil pasta underneath was not cooked to perfection. It was on the hard side and the sauce was not distributed evenly. On top of that, the pasta was stuck together so it was difficult to eat. It made me question whether the pasta was made to order and it just sucked or if they just had it pre-cooked.

Was seated outside but we requested to be inside to avoid the cold and had an additional wait of twenty minutes when the hostess forgot to add us back onto the waiting list. Needless to say, we were not happy when we found out that we were waiting for nothing. Hostess even started back talking to us, claiming we never asked to be seated. Not even a single apology. Are people not trained before working here?  The upsetting interaction with the lady in the front made our moods sour, but I was lit with joy when they brought out the bread and butter. Truly a classic. If I want to justify eating a slice of cheesecake for $9, this bread would be my justification. And probably the best part of the meal. Hubby and I split the chicken fingers, which was sub-par at best. (You're probably better off getting some KFC on a Tuesday--take advantage of they Tuesday $1 special!) We barely ate half of it, as the mashed potatoes and diced vegetables (cucumbers, pumpkin, other types of weird squash) along with the rye bread filled us up. The cheesecake came and we were delighted. Server toppled over my whipped cream so my Instagram photo was delayed a couple minutes. White chocolate macadamia nut and cheesecake did not mix at all. All I could taste was the nut (and these buggers were huge!) and barely any cheesecake. I'm a picky eater but last time I recalled this was the Cheesecake Factory not the Nuts With Cheesecake On The Side Factory. Overall service was splendid from the nice gentleman.

Our waiter was courteous and brought us the bread in a timely manner.  I ordered the crispy crab wontons and farfelle chicken mushroom pasta.  In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a bit overpriced, I mean, $15 burgers? $12 salads?

Today, however, there were a ton of people waiting around at 6 on a Saturday, and since there were only two of us, I decided to try.  Only a 10-15 minute wait! And the buzzer went off within that promised timeframe.  We were seated waaaay in the back, in the rotunda end of the restaurant. The new thing I noticed was a ""special"" menu that was handed separately from the book they give you. It was strange because it wasn't like ""limited specials"" or ""specials of the day"" so I have no idea what it was about, but it seemed more reasonably priced.  I decided to go with the tomato basil pasta, which was $11.95 and consisted of grilled chicken, pesto sauce, penne pasta, tomatoes, basil all tossed in olive oil.

Kelly T.,"Orange County, CA",0,78,101,4.0,6/15/2010,"As far as family-friendly chain restaurants go, Cheesecake Factory is one of the best, in my opinion. In fact, one of the reasons I like it is because it can be what you need it to be - from a family outing with kids, to a girls night out for cocktails. Other chains are not so adaptable. They have an extensive menu with all kinds of food on it, a large cocktail menu, and of course a large selection of different types of cheesecake.  My favorite thing about the menu is the fairly recent addition of a ""small plates"" section on their menu. Most of the items are $5 and there are some great choices like croquettes, bacon wrapped dates, small salads, and pizettes which are actually pretty big for their price.  The only things I DON'T like about the menu are all the advertisements, and also that there are a few ""lighter"" salads called ""Weight Management"". So if you want to order the lighter salad, you have to order the ""Weight Management Pear and Endive Salad"", and that's kind of embarassing to say. Even to just put the word ""Light"" in front of it would be better than ""Weight Management"" :) I've ordered cocktails a few times there, and they are usually a good size and strong. The bathroom has a good baby changing station in the large stall. I'm not sure about every Cheesecake Factory location, but at the Irvine Spectrum location I've noticed the floor is super slippery.

Most of the plates I've seen served at Cheesecake Factory have had excellent presentation. The pasta is always well garnished on a large plate and comes served steaming hot and looking delicious. However, the steak that Nam ordered looked like something you would've seen served in a hospital cafeteria. It came on a small plain white dish in a pool of its juices, about half the size of the pasta plates, with a small bowl of fries on the side. Restaurants should know that customers eat with their eyes first, and this did not look appetizing at all. Especially at $26 a plate. I could've made this at home! The steak itself is a no frills type steak. No sauce, no garnish, just a slab of steak. Taste-wise it was about as plain as it looked. Very tender and good meaty flavor but lacking in even the salt and pepper it seemed.  Overall the family meal experience was pleasant, all except for the steak.

If you come here to meet up your friends for drinks, try getting the Carribean Cooler.  It basically tastes like strawberries with whipped cream with a little punch of alcohol.  It is so delicious and my friend Christine and I make sure we order it every time we come here. Other than that, you really can't go wrong with any of the foods here.  The food comes out pretty consistent each time I am here.  Service is okay- not great.

I was actually caught off guard to hear that the strawberry cheesecake was frozen.  The girl behind the counter told us that we couldn't eat it right away and would have to wait until it thaws.  The strawberries were frozen too.  Luckily, we were planning to eat it as an after dinner dessert, and we had enough time for it to thaw out until then.  When we did try it, no one could tell it was frozen before. Although the sliced cheesecakes are a lot smaller than I last remembered, they're still very creamy goooood.  The banana cream one had a layer of, what else, banana cream on top of the cheesecake layer and freshly sliced banana on top, and the pineapple upside down one was just that with cheesecake layered in between. Just beware that a slice alone is like almost eating a whole day's worth of calories (a slice of the banana cream is supposedly 925 calories, and the pineapple upside down is 1187 calories...).  Gaaaaah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=540

S Y.,"Anaheim, CA",0,93,4,2.0,12/20/2014,"came here on a Friday evening with two small children, we had walked the whole spectrum to get to the restaurant so by the time we got there we were ok with waiting.  we took the pager and waited, and waited, with two small children under age 2, and then finally!  our pager goes off and we can be seated.  But no!  Do not be deceived!  they have a SECOND waiting area!  So your pager goes off, and then they escort you to ANOTHER waiting area where the other bozos like you are standing around, waiting AGAIN.   So at that point, after we had gotten our two hungry and ancy kids up and thinking we were going to start eating, we were upset.  So we turned around and decided to eat at the bar, where they have multiple small booths and some tall tables with stools.  One of the staff told us we could take the booth in the corner of the bar, which we gladly did.  We got our kids settled and finally all was good.  But no!!!!!!!!!! our server came up and said that actually that we are not allowed to sit at that table and that we have to get up!  WHAT?????????????  At this point, I said no - please go check it out, we are at the bar and it's open seating, AND your own staff member set us up here.  So he goes back to check and then comes back and tells us that we have a table assigned to us in a different location.   Basically we refused to uproot the kids and trek across the restaurant again to get to a different ""assigned"" table.  This whole system about the second level waiting area was frustrating enough - not to mention being guided to an OPEN SEATING TABLE at the BAR and then being told we can't sit there?  They need to get their act together.  Totally ruined the experience.  My husband ordered the Jambalaya, I ordered the Salmon Salad, we also got a grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and carrots for the kids.  The grilled chicken for the kids was perfect, delicious.  The Jambalaya was also very good.  The salmon salad was definitely 2/5 stars - apparently the salmon is traditionally served cold but you can ask for it hot - it came lukewarm and undercooked with no seasoning at all.   I bumped them up a star because after the whole fiasco the server treated us nicely and except for the salmon salad the food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=540

Ann M.,"Anaheim, CA",95,253,2,3.0,1/9/2014,"I wish you could give half stars on Yelp because I think this place really rightfully falls between ""meh i've experienced better"" and ""a-ok"".  Since that's not an option, I'll be generous and round up. As I've said before, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but my boyfriend got a giftcard for Christmas so we decided to take a night off from cooking and grab dinner here.  Despite the epic length of their menu, there was nothing I was dying to try, only options I was willing to eat.  My boyfriend and I each ordered a glass of wine and I ordered the Cajun chicken littles (essentially breaded chicken fingers with mashed potatoes and succotash) and he ordered the Bellagio Chicken (I think that's what it was called) on the server's recommendation.  While my meal was fine, there was absolutely nothing Cajun about the chicken fingers - the breading was absolutely bland and I would have killed from some tapito or sirracha or something.  Happily, my boyfriend really enjoyed his meal.  The bill for this relatively simple meal came to $50.17 which I consider pricey for a chain given what we orderd, but the portions were absolutely gargantuan.  We both could have easily been full (despite being starving when we sat down) just sharing one entree, but we weren't familiar with the restaurant so we ordered two. While the service was good and the meal was fine, I don't think we'll hurry back.  I'd prefer to go to a non-chain that serves better meals with more reasonable portions for the same money or less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=660

Highs - Love the bread - you get unlimited sourdough and whole wheat baguettes. - Spicy crispy chicken sandwich - try this at least once if you like Jack In the Box's version - upscale junk food at its finest. - Thai lettuce wraps - appetizer that can be eaten as a meal.  One of the lowest calorie options on the menu and won't make you feel bloated afterwards. - One of the best places for dessert.  I've gone in a few times just to order a cheesecake with my girlfriend. - Salads are huge and quite delicious.  Every salad has a strong crunch element, making each salad texturally unique and interesting to eat. Lows - Food is inconsistent.  I wanted to label jambalaya and the gumbo as highs, but unfortunately the dishes can be hit or miss.  One day you get it, it will be tremendously flavorful.  At other times it will be too oily and bland.   - Happy hour is a joke (if they still have it).  Just walk a few stores down to Yardhouse instead. - Cocktails are overpriced and not good - The Robert Mondavi house wines are awful - believe it or not Charles Shaw is better. - Never, ever get the breakfast food - far too greasy for my tastes.  Not sure exactly why, but this place is always packed with people.  If you've got better options or have a place bookmarked that you'd like to try, do yourself a favor and go there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=660

And if you want, you can switch out any of the sides that come with whatever you order. If you substitute sweet potato fries instead of regular fries for your side, there is an extra charge.  This specific location is always pretty busy and the wait time can get pretty long especially during the weekends. All the staff members are friendly and the overall service is good.

Christine W.,"Corona, CA",51,13,1,1.0,3/21/2013,"So the last time I gave a restaurant a bad review, I got a waitress fired...but because what I said prompted the owner to look into the waitress' service which ultimately led to his disapproval of her behavior. However, she wasn't going down without a fight so she ended up harassing me on yelp but the owner apologized to me and she eventually stopped. So, fingers crossed that it doesn't happen here.  I don't know if it's just the specific waiter that I had or perhaps the waiters mentally checked out because my bf and I went late, but the service was terrible. Firstly, I wanted to point out that for some reason, we got sat in the very back. I saw some empty tables on my way allllll the way to the back. I don't remember the waiter's name because he didn't care to get our attention or greet us when he came to our table. Every time that we interacted with him, I could tell he didn't give a flip what we had to say and he would walk away abruptly after we'd asked for something. And of course, no smiles. I get that it's no Nick and Stef's or Ruth's Chris but does it hurt to smile? The nice lady at the $5 ramen place near my house that I go to gives better service than this. I have nothing against cheesecake factorys. In fact, it used to be my favorite restaurant growing up. However, I have to comment on the fact that this particular Cheesecake just didn't have the same friendliness. At another Cheesecake, when I asked if I could take the delicious brown bread we all love home, the waitress boxed it up for me and gave me an extra fresh one still warm. This guy over here tin foiled my half brown bread along with the white bread, and threw it in our to-go bag.  Sigh, it was just disappointing to not be given good service. It was a special day for me! I know that I can't judge because it's just one server but don't you think they should make sure that every server gives excellent service to every customer? It's important to remember that every customer counts and that every customer has family and friends and could be a potential regular. Oh, and the food was really greasy. Or at least the pasta was. Don't order a pasta dish unless you're splurging. In which case, I ordered the farfalle, which was not bad.

We went in to put our name on the wait list, we had a party of 8. The hostess told us that we needed to wait off to the side so her manager could do a walk around of the restaurant to find out how long our wait would be . So we waited and he said 20-30 minutes which was fine but the he told us we had a two hour maximum that we could be there for. This seemed a little silly seeing as how we were about to spend a pretty penny. When we got seated it was around 9:30 which was the time they said we would be waiting. We ordered our drinks which were good. Our waitress was friendly and accommodating, maybe a little slow but fine just the same. It took around 45 minutes for us to get our food after we ordered it and when it came out it was Ice cold. We all had the same issue but we were hungry and we had been there for over two hours any way. My boyfriend ordered a couple sides of ranch which came out with his burger but then one of our friends also decided to order some ranch. The person who brought our food told us that we needed to share the ranch and that it would take a while to get more which was kind of weird..my friend never got his ranch.

The Grilled Artichokes are delicous, and melt in your mouth. The only gripe I have is when water is ordered always be sure to offer a straw.

The food is good, usually consistent.  The columns and marble (i.e. ambiance)... a bit odd, but whatever.  CF's are always busy (20 minute wait most of the times I've been).  Typical Yard House-like menu where they offer a billion dishes.  I start with the Crispy Cuban Rolls and Dynamite Shrimp, then get the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  It's one of the best things ever.  Eva's, in Laguna, has some good Caribbean food, but I would take CF's JBPS (ooh... look at me abbreviating) over anything Eva puts out.  Now for the rating... I wouldn't give it 3 stars (it's better than that), but it's not really 4 stars, either.  Again, wish we could tweak the rating system.  I'll go with 4, though, as it's certainly better than ""A-OK.""  Hmm... how would I tweak the ratings?  Let's see. 1 star - Dog food is better (and sometimes really tasty; what?). 1 1/2 stars - It's not quite dog food, but Purina has clouded my judgment. 2 stars - Like a bad buffet, but... it served its purpose at the time. Won't be back. 2 1/2 stars - I went back, but not sure why. It's just as bland as I remember. 3 stars - It's not terrible, nor is it amazing.  Works in a pinch.  Think Yard House. 3 1/2 stars - Pretty good.  Consistent.  I like it. 4 stars - Wow... that was an awesome meal.  Cool place. 4 1/2 stars - I don't know... this might be one of my favorites now.  Delicious. 5 stars - Sublime.  Everything was perfect.  Think Nobu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=420

I agree that the set up and decor are the same and the menu items are the same. But I disagree that every Cheesecake Factory is the ""same"". I walked into this particular location planning to dislike it. Why? There were tons of people in line. It was a Friday night and it was noisy and crowded. I had to be at a concert and we decided to sit at the bar to avoid a wait for a table. Now I really didn't expect the bartenders to be happy about serving three customers dinner and only one bar drink out of the three of us. But I was wrong. The bartenders were awesome. I ordered a pineapple mojito and the avocado rolls. My son has the Caesar salad and my husband had the veggie burger and side salad. We all three love love love the bread that comes before dinner. The bartenders had no problem refilling our basket of bread! Let me start with the pineapple mojito. It was beautiful. It looked like something out of a food magazine. It tasted even better. The avocado rolls were served warm and with fresh avocado. I adore the dipping sauce it comes with.  My son ordered the appetizer sized salad and it was more than enough for my 21 year old son.  My husband enjoyed his veggie burger and salad. In the meantime the bartenders made sure to keep the non alcoholic drinks flowing and I sipped my oversized pineapple mojito the entire time we were there. My only complaint was the two couples, two older balding men with two blonde women in white dresses. They seemed to be in their 50s but acted and talked like teenagers. They decided to plant themselves directly behind us at the bar, one of the men put his hand on my chair back rest and made me feel very uncomfortable. They were talking very loud and were not respectful of personal space. That was not a reflection of the quality of food or service so I did not reduce the stars based on those rude customers.

Janene B.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,8,,2.0,8/14/2016,"I think everyone knows that the CF has really good food and great desserts.  Met my Sister there yesterday for an early lunch.  We got there at 11:30, right after they opened.  I asked if we could sit on window side and after a brief wait we were walked back to the very back (no booths, just tables) and showed a table right next to a party of 4.  We declined and asked if we could sit at one of the empty booths we passed on the way back.  We were walked back to the front, the hostess then tried to seat us on the side I told her we didn't want to sit in the bar area. Again we declined and asked about an empty booth.  We were kind of indifferently told there were no servers available to cover that area and that we would have a 15 minute wait.  Um,  look around you ...  there were maybe 5 or 6 people waiting that came in after we did.  There were a multitude of open tables and a few open booths.  Hey, I'm paying to eat here and I think I get to sit where I choose within reason.  Note to management:   Maybe train your front desk staff to be a little more customer oriented.  What would have worked for us is if we had been offered one of the empty booths, given a glass of water or other beverage and politely told that we might have to wait for a short time before a server could get back to us.  Waiting up front by the door for a server to show up wasn't the right option.  We left and chose another one of the many nice restaurants at the Spectrum.  Probably will next time we go too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=420

Rodney M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,26,18,1.0,1/3/2016,I came on 01/03/2016 at 8:40-ish for dinner. I ordered an Angel hair pasta Alfredo with salmon and unsweetened tropical iced tea. The forks on the table had food residue. I asked for another set. The new set came and all utensils had water residue and looked quite dirty. When my dinner arrived the side of the white plate multiple stains (manager claims its water stains) stemming from the bowl side of the plate all the way to the side of the rim. Almost as if someone took a dirty rag and wiped the plate with it before putting in the food. When i ensisted to pay my bill and get out of the place the male manager kicked me out like a dog.

Apparently she was having a bad night and was NOT happy to have a large group. She ignored our several requests for water and when she finally brought it she sat our water AND glasses on a table next to us and rather then serve us walked over to table next to us to take their order. And that was as good as it got. Had to ask for bread and butter. She was pretty much invisible. We finally got the attention of another waiters to help us. When he spoke to her she snapped at him.

The manager brought over a few, but said he didn't have enough of them for the entire table.  A majority of my group had already ordered, but didn't have the opportunity to order from a healthier menu, because they didn't get the menus in time.

Annika Jo L.,"Charlotte, NC",75,131,38,3.0,10/6/2013,"What can I say? Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. Despite an annoyingly large and extensive menu, the food is reliable. We can always count on CF for a good slice of cheesecake to take home for dessert. They're always super accommodating when it comes to kids and strollers too. They always bring out a plate of sliced bananas and sliced bread for the kiddo as soon as they seat us.

Scott M.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",27,255,5,3.0,11/16/2011,"What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory? I can say I like it and I might like it better if the lines weren't 45-60 minutes most of the time. If I knew I could make reservations or wait no more than 10 minutes it would be an okay place to go with friends because the menu is so varied everyone can get what they want, Italian, American comfort food, etc. But it is also that varied menu that is a major drawback of TCF. You can't really execute like ten pages of menu items and do a great job on all or maybe even most of them. And when you are trying to appeal to a broad audience you don't take chances on bold and innovative flavors, you play it pretty safe. What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory? I can say I like it, but don't love it, liked it better when it first opened in Beverly Hills and I wish they would cut out half the menu, settle on about 7 entrees to do really well and have 3 nightly specials based on bold, brash flavors and what they can source locally at that location so that the specials at the Irvine TCF would be completely different from the Honolulu TCF or even the Pasadena TCF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=680

The buzzer actually detects pretty far, so don't worry. I usually get pasta at Cheesecake (I LOVE pasta) and out of all the pasta I've tried, my favorite are Pasta Da Vinci. It is because it's just perfect for me! I love the sauce and everything in the pasta. Best of all, after I'm done eating, I don't feel disguested or guilty. Another favorite of mine is the cajun jambalaya pasta. SO GOOD! I've had some friends who complain that Cheesecake is on the pricer side, but if you share with someone, it's not that bad. One plate of pasta will usually fill 2 people too. And if you're still hungry after that....there's always desserts! Out of all the amazing cheesecake, I love the Godiva one!

Michelle S.,"Orange County, CA",35,6,2,3.0,10/30/2011,"Summary: Okay food, service (though friendly) is slow, what's with the flies??, cheesecake is good as always. I would have given it a 2 except for the cheesecakes. This location has a special memory for my husband and I since it was one of our first places to visit together as a couple. So when we decided to go on a VERY rare date without the kids, we ended up here. We came a bit before the dinner crowd so we were seated really quickly. I'm used to standing in line for the Cheesecake Factory. The hostess actually took us past empty tables next to the window and seated us right next to the bathroom entrance. ???? I'm not sure if she was doing a waiter/waitress a favor by placing us in their area, but I definitely asked her to seat us next to the several window seats that were open. The waitress promptly showed up and offered us bread and drinks, so we munched on that while we decided on food. My husband commented that his menu needed to be cleaned. I have often found their menus a bit greasy, but I have a thing about clean menus. I decided on the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Thai dish with white rice. My husband decided on the crab cake sandwich. We were planning on trying each other's food.  I hadn't read everything in detail and missed that toasted coconut topped the dish, so I had missed telling my waitress that I wanted it on the side. I don't prefer coconut over my rice dishes. They were very nice about replacing it though my husband had already tasted it.  Service was a bit slow as soon as the dinner ""rush"" started. I had asked for a cup of decaf coffee, but the waitress had forgotten, so the hostess that came by to ask if I had gotten my replacement dish had to get it herself. (I think it took about another 20 minutes for my replacement Bang Bang dish to come.) I wasn't expecting a great thai dish at the CF, so considering that, it was decent. It tasted more like alfredo sauce with a bit of curry in it, but it did hit the spot that was craving Asian food. There wasn't much meat in it, and a few of the chicken pieces were tough and dry. However, the few shrimp that I did have tasted pretty good. My husband said his crab cake sandwich was pretty good, but he liked better the Bang Bang dish WITH the coconut on top. As for dessert, we ended up getting their new Reeses peanut butter cup choco cake cheesecake with the layers of salted caramel. It was good but VERY thick. I don't think I'll order it again as I like more of their lighter and fluffier cheesecakes like the tiramisu or tuxedo cream. My husband loves Reeses peanut butter cups and salted caramel so he was in love with it. Oh yeah... flies. I'm not sure what was going on, but there were 3 flies that were hanging all over our window. My husband ended up shooing one away and killing another. It was disgusting. And as we were leaving another fly just croaked right on to our table. I was so glad it was when we were leaving and not when we had food on the table. I noticed that the place wasn't as full as it used to be even on a Thursday night. My husband thought that it was because it was on a week night, but I remember having to wait for tables even on week days.

Paul L.,"Irvine, CA",729,418,1098,2.0,9/9/2010,"About three years ago, I wrote a review of The Cheesecake Factory that began with the following sentence: ""The Cheesecake Factory just blows."" Three years later, I pretty much feel the same way. But since I had a gift certificate, I decided to give this place another shot. If nothing else, at least the cheesecake would be good, right? Dinner started off well. I have always been a fan of their bread basket -- warm sourdough and pumpernickel -- and could have eaten the entire thing. But sadly that is where the good food ended. Upon our server's recommendation, I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, which came with Coleslaw and Fries. Big mistake! The pork tasted like it had been braised instead of smoked (ZERO smoke flavor) and the sauce was so cloying sweet that it could have been served for dessert. I tend to like my pulled pork Carolina style, which uses a vinegar-based sauce, but this sauce was very tropical; it was loaded down with pineapple, mangos, and fruit punch. Great for a smoothie, maybe, but not for BBQ.  The Crabcake Sandwich was a little better, but still missed the mark in terms of flavor and texture. The crab did not taste very fresh, and really needed an acid to brighten it up, and the patty was kind of mushy. To be honest, the best thing about the sandwich was the brioche bun. Both sandwiches went unfinished, hoping that the cheesecake would really deliver. Sadly, and to be honest quite surprisingly, it didn't. We disregarded our server's recommendations (fool me once) and ordered instead the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which has layers of cheesecake, fudge cake and chocolate truffle cream. As a dessert, it was fine, but you couldn't even taste the cheesecake! All you tasted was chocolate, so overwhelmed was the cheesecake. For a place that has the word ""cheesecake"" in its name, you would think that the cheesecake flavor would be front and center. So three years later, my impressions of The Cheesecake Factory have not changed. Lesson learned, again. The only thing bums me out now is that I still have money left on my gift card but have absolutely no desire to return. 1 1/2 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=680

This guy was on top of everything, drinks refills, and checking up on us often (not to the point where it was annoying though).  I got a little worried when our appetizer wasnt very hot but it wasnt undercooked or anything so we didnt really worry about. We ordered a  chinese chicken salad next and we decided to share it.

I can't think of another chain doing as good a job.  I took my wife and two of our grand-girls to the Spectrum CF for an early Valentine's Day dinner. As usual, the visit included great customer service, from the hostesses to the wait staff. And tonight, Ryan, our server, was at the top of his CF customer-service-game. We were never without bread and drink refills, and the guy was just one of the nicest servers we've had while at any restaurant. It seems I've lucked out, because this is pretty much what I get at every location I visit.  When my wife and I travel together, and we want a late lunch or dinner with no surprises, we'll look for a Cheesecake Factory location. I've found every location amazingly consistent in both service level and food prep and quality. And as for the Spectrum location... it's one of our reliable favorites. The only ""OK"" visit I can remember was at the Tyler Mall, Riverside store, and then it was a worn out server that I remember, not a food issue. And even then I remember her covering all the bases, but obviously at the end of her shift, tired and distracted. She didn't take it out on us, she just didn't have the spunkiness we're used to. So if that's the worst I can remember, I'd say that's a good thing. While I can understand and empathize with anyone who's had a bad experience at a CF location, including this one, I tend to think it's an anomoly. It just doesn't happen that often, and when it does, I'll bet a call to the location's manager will produce both a sincere apology and a complimentary dinner, or at minimum, fair compensation for whatever may have happened.  Our corporation has sold to some of the chain and franchise food groups here in the US, and in my ""black book and private list"" of best operations..... CKE (Carl's Jr. and Hardy's), and Cheesecake Factory are at the top of my list. My recommendation for a ""Table for Two?"" Try ordering the Chicken Madera and the full size Santa Fe Salad. Ask for two extra plates, and split both items. It makes for a great ""salad-entree"" combo, and I assure you, there will be more than enough food. The chicken is served with two chicken breast filets and plenty of mashed potatoes. And the salad? Well, it's probably enough for three to four guests!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=580

The bread was great, as usual - but that's where the pleasantries ended.  We waited a solid 25 minutes before we even got our menus. There was nobody checking up on the tables on this side of the restaurant, apparently.  Before we ordered, we instructed the waiter that we wanted separate checks for every party member. Of course, when the check came at the very end (after waiting 30 minutes for him to come, no less) it was NOT separated as we had asked.

Ryan D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",205,94,10,4.0,2/27/2013,"Very nice cheesecake factory. Came here on a monday night around 7 and there was no wait. We were quickly seated and given a basket of their bread. My gf loves he brown wheat bread, while I like their regular french bread.  Our waitress was Megan and he was very friendly. We ordered the Avocado Eggrolls as our appetizer. I got the Mushroom Burger and my gf got the Garlic Noodles. Avocado Eggrolls 3 large avocado stuffed egg rolls, cut in half and served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. These were very good. I usually do not care much for avocados, but these were very refreshing. Pretty filling though. After were split these and had some bread, we weren't that hungry anymore. Mushroom Burger Nice huge burger with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms. I enjoyed the nice toasted bun and the meat was nicely cooked. The onions were very sweet and the swiss cheese was very nice. The mushrooms were a little thick for me and had a little too much mushroomy flavor that I personally do not like that much. Overall a nice burger for mushroom lovers. Garlic Noodles My gf always gets these noodles as they are her favorite. It is a simple clean noodle with a light sauce. The actually didnt finish much of it this time as we were stuffed from the eggrolls. I am very happy with their service. We asked to get the garlic noodles boxed up while we paid the bill and by the time we paid and were ready to go, we forgot we had the noodles boxed up. We left for about 10 minutes by the time we realized we forgot the noodles. Basically the entire dish was left and we paid for it, so we were hoping they didnt throw it away. We called in and they said the usually throw it away, but Megan saved it for us and it was in the bakery fridge. I give Megan a thumbs up!

Maybe different management, maybe better economy, either way, we had one of the best service in a very, very long time, esp. in a family friendly restaurant. Our server, Olivia, deserves a raise and a mandatory 25%+ tip from all patrons. :) She was all smiles, very patient with our table full of kids who could not make up their mind when ordering their drinks, lunch, and desserts from their kids' menu (think endless questions and constantly changing decisions). very friendly, made small talks, the others who brought the food were all smiles too. Our crabcakes, fish and chips, hawaiian pizza, fettucine alfredo, Fried calamari, white cheddar and broccoli soup, Kobe burger, and popcorn shrimp were all fantastic. So much better than last time.  One tip: Do not order the sliders. I felt it was a total rip off. For $7.95, you  get four small burgers that are absolutely unremarkable, tasted like boiled beef patties on buns with ketchup. I could not take a second bite.  Cheesecakes, mmmm... I wish they did not put the calories sign next to the cake display.

Looking at the past reviews, it looked liked this place doesn't take reservations. We were practically starving by the time we got seated.  It was a long drive to get to Irvine and having to wait was even more excruciating.  I ordered a medium well Filet Mignon.  I have to say it's well done.  The atmosphere was like almost family reunion for most tables as it looked to be the place to be for most households.  The parking will tough to navigate if you come on a busy night.  The big plus for anyone is that is was so close to a lot of spots in Irvine Spectrum, it's probably the restaurant choice for the spectrum crowds.  So plan ahead if you want to this particular Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=860
flo c.,"Irvine, CA",147,775,98,2.0,10/26/2007,"My boyfriend and I don't always agree on food. Our points of contention include pho, sushi and kabobs. However, we do agree on some things, and Cheesecake Factory is one of them.  Cheesecake Factory is a Don't. It's like we're programmed to like the place because apparently everyone else and their 10 BFFs are here, waiting for a table. When you walk past the throng of people eyeing you in jealousy because your buzzer buzzed, it's almost like beckoned by the bouncer at the hottest club.  But the food is mediocre at best. The only good things we've tried (aside from maybe the complimentary bread- when warm) would be the garlic noodles, the chinese chicken salad (or something to that effect) and the desserts, especially the chocolate cake. The low-carb cheesecake isn't too shoddy either. I think I semi-liked the jerk shrimp but it was mostly for the fried plantains. The sheer amount of calories and cholesterol in the burger our friend ordered is ridiculous. I mean a double-stack with cheese, bacon and bread...with fries. OMG. You would have to be an alligator for that thing to fit into your mouth.  I also thought that the avocado egg rolls, while applauded by most, were just okay. The first piece was good, but subsequent pieces seemed to be an overkill. That's a sign of just okay-ness. Service is a hit or miss. The best server we ever had was a tall brunette with pink makeup and bangs across her forehead. Too bad she was the sub while the real guy was on lunch. I think her name may have been Olga or Helga, or maybe that's what I secretly called her in my head? Patio service was a miss for me. Maybe it's because we're outside, but I found it to be rather unattentive. If you're willing to stand the wait, get yourself over to Javier's because that at least is tasty and unique. Price-wise, it's about the same (it IS the Spectrum, after all) and you get your money's worth here. Just get the dessert(s) to go.

Annalisa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,71,3,2.0,8/9/2010,"Usually I always have good experience with Cheesecake Factory (all locations) and they have been a favorite spur-of-the-moment dining for me since a while back.  The waiters/waitresses are usually very attentive and friendly.  I don't mind the wait for a table, because like any other restaurant like this, it's normal. However, last Tuesday I came here and I realized that on some days these guys REALLY went downhill. 1-We were taken to a table by the hostess, who REALLY needs more training in common sense.  She seated my Fiance at a window table with the sun shining STRAIGHT in his face (is this even okay? the glare-sheet-window things didn't help one bit), so he squintedly but politely asked to move tables, to which she said okay. 2-After we moved tables, we were not given utensils, so I had to go grab it from the table we were originally placed at (it's my job to get my own utensils now?...).  I knew something was missing, but until I was trying to eat my food and realized there were no utensils.  No one on the staff noticed... 3-Not more than 5 minutes later, the senseless woman (the hostess) seat someone else at the exact same spot that we asked to move from.  That poor couple was too nice to ask to change seats, even though they looked very uncomfortble with the glare in their face. 4-The Calamari sucked (normally it's good, but what's with today?).  Gosh, I know you guys are busy, but I know undercooked food when I eat it.  It's probably cooked enough to legal standards but taste-wise I should have just kept my money. 5-The waitress needed more training.  I had better service and professionalism from waitresses at other restaurants who have trouble opening wine bottles (at least they were professional about it).  Our waitress today was leaning left and right excessively and slouching as she spoke to us and took our orders.  And it took FOREVER to get anything done.  It made me feel like I was at a Carls Jr. or something. +1 Star for the excellent main dish, though.  But other than that, what a dissapointing day.  My only reason to ever return to this restaurant after this experience is in the hope that that was just a one-day ordeal where they were training new restaurant staff or something.  Normally everything is much better.  What gives lately?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=860

Seeing as I waited tables here for 5 years ('02-'07) I definitely have a love/hate relationship with this restaurant.  As someone who is no longer an employee here, if I was at the Spectrum....I'd eat at Javier's. You can eat at Cheesecake anyplace, anytime, because apparently they're trying to be Starbucks and want to have a location on every corner. When I first started working there in '02, it was still an annoying corporate chain....but not half as bad as it is now. I mean, they cater now?? What is that?? I'm sorry, but who the hell wants their event catered by The Cheese?? And there's a kid's menu now too....what are they turning in to?? Denny's?? Gross.  Anyways, all the food here is beyond fattening...which is fine when you're waiting tables and on your feet 8 hours a day....but for the average consumer you might want to watch out. Yea there are salads...but beware of the dressing....even the balsamic vinaigrette is loaded with sugar. They have a ""weight management"" section of the menu for those of you trying to watch the calories. You can lift your head proud and say, ""I'd like to order the weight management _____ salad."" Weight Management?? They couldn't come up with a less humiliating term?? When I waited tables my favorite was when people would order a ""weight management"" salad, diet coke, and finish their meal with a slice of cheesecake....all the slices are at least 600+ calories a slice by the way. When I visited a different location recently I noticed that they now list the number of calories in each slice.....their new red velvet cake cheesecake has something like 1300 calories a slice!! I mean, it tastes great...but that's close to your entire daily caloric intake! Alright...enough with the crazy calorie counting....even thought this place gave me nightmares of being stuck in a freezer full of cheesecakes coming to life there are a few dishes that I fondly remember. I worked here when I ate meat so these are the entrees I used to love: Bistro Shrimp Pasta, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Jambalaya, Stuffed Chicken Tortillas, and the Shrimp Scampi. Favorite desserts are the Key Lime Cheesecake, Lemoncello Cake and the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel Cheesecake.  As much as I want to hate this place, there are a few fond memories.....but I don't plan on going back anytime soon...

It's location near the theatre and shopping is quite convenient.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=860
Ryan M.,"Emeryville, CA",783,912,135,3.0,1/16/2007,"Well my third review, here on   so let's get started. I've never dined at a Cheesecake factory, so I was truly skeptical in the beginning about the cuisine (other than its lavish cheesecakes). The reason is because of the same stuff everyone has already mentioned. Extremely packed, and it lacks the reservations system (which would have been preferred). However after you've overcome those hurdles, you sit on a table accompanied with your friends or date, and actually enjoy the ambiance everyone is familiar with. Kind of reminds me of Spaghetti Factory actually, just with the extra incentive for Cheesecake. From appetizers to main courses, they are on point, and again the Cheesecake (White Chocolate/ Peanut Butter Truffle) a SoCal exclusive for those of you familiar, with the Cheesecake Factory offerings in NorCal.  It was frustrating, but definitely well worth the wait, and it gives me an extra push to drive 15-20 mins just to get a box of my own, once in a blue moon The service is excellent there is nothing for me to complain about, they are prompt and courteous to all dining guests. Overall, this is one of the many gems of the Irvine Spectrum Center, so if you haven't enjoyed the cuisine of Cheesecake Factory, then I suggest this place for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=860
Michael C.,"Saratoga, CA",219,257,19,3.0,12/4/2007,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory for the longest time, but was called last minute to take a biz trip down to SoCal, and my first meeting was here.  I guess I don't go to Cheesecake too often... I was early, so I had to wait for about 30 mins, and I noticed that there isn't a bar inside, so I was debating whether to go to the bar across the way, but it was way packed, so decided not to at the end.   Finally met up with everyone, and I ended up ordering the Kobe Burger.  It tasted like a regular burger, but wasn't too bad.   Overall, it was a pretty non-eventful business dinner, and I got business done, but food was just like I would have expected any other Cheesecake to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=860

Jennifer L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",145,177,145,2.0,2/23/2012,"So I am generally not a fan of chains, however, I am simply writing this review because the Manager here is absolutely positively the nicest woman I have ever met.  She is accommodating and even with our bad experience here she really did make our night better.  I feel terrible for losing her card but in case anyone from the restaurant is reading this she has brown hair, is caucasian, and really nice! (idk if that helps much but I tried!)  She really does deserve a raise.   Now, on to the next note.  Their waiting staff is not a very bright bunch.  They are slow, don't check up on you very often, and seem to have a common trait of forgetting various parts of your order.  I have been here probably 5 times in the past 4 months and 5 out of those 5 times I have had something wrong with my order.  There has been hair in my food, plates coming in extremely cold, and appetizers completely forgotten. The most recent time I came here we didn't even receive our food for 45 minutes to an hour because they had forgotten to place our orders!!!  It's a wonder that our waiter didn't even say anything to us, I personally think she forgot we were a a part of her section!

Known for their desserts, their regular menu is also pretty good.  I had a bowl of clam chowder that was thoroughly satisfying and filling... not the cheap skimpy portion that you sometimes get at other places. I wish I remembered how big the portions were to begin with because I also ordered the Chicken Avocado Club sandwich too and although it was delicious, I could only eat half of it and bag the rest. My better half was smarter and although she also had the bowl of clam chowder, she was absolutely delighted with the arugula, beet, and feta salad that she had. My other dinner guests were happy with their Chicken Madeira and Chicken Marsala and Mushroom plates. One warning: the portions are huge -- 3 out of 4 of us wound up bagging.  Our server was very courteous and attentive.

Myrna C.,"New York, NY",214,118,42,5.0,8/31/2012,"One of my favorite places to go when I'm looking for a place to eat out at close to home. I've been coming here since I was a kid, but stopped coming at one point. Now, I'm back here all the time. The best part about this place is how extensive their menu is. It's pretty easy to find something for everyone. My two favorite dishes, as of late, have been the Pasta Da Vinci and the Sausage Ricotta Flatbread. I think I've ordered that pasta dish EVERY SINGLE TIME for the last five or six times; it hasn't gotten old. The flavors are so amazing; the sauce is a little on the sweeter side, which isn't usually something that I like, but something about this pasta is just bomb. Plus, the portobello mushrooms really add something to it. What's great about the Sausage Ricotta Flatbread is that it's on their new Skinnylicious menu. I think it's only $5.95 and under 490 calories!!!  Cheap and healthy, not to mention delicious.  We always get a slice of cheesecake after the meal too. The last one we tried was the Pina Colada as well as the Banana Cream. I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the flavors. They're all superb. Since it's a chain, if I'm out travelling and don't know where to go, there's usually a Cheesecake Factory somewhere nearby to satisfy my hunger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=620

This one star is for the manager Chris. Here's my story... I was taking my brother, sister and our families out for their birthdays. We arrived at 5pm, put our name in and was told it would be about 20 min. But didn't get seated until 5:40 but figured no big deal. Our waitress was very nice, took our drink orders but she was very busy. She took our food order at about 6:00 but our food did not arrive until about  6:45. Again, no big deal. At 7:15 they came and sang happy birthday. Here is where the 1 star comes in. At about 7:25 Chris the manager comes over to ask how everything was and then proceeded to tell us they had a 2 hour time limit and we needed to leave.

According to my friend, this place gets crazy packed starting at lunchtime.  I was a little appalled to realize that they actually had to ask us if we wanted their bread. I thought every Cheesecake Factory brings some out unconditionally. Anyway I had the skinnylicious chicken sandwich which has less than 590 calories with some salad on the plate. My friend had the blueberry pancakes and his son had the kids pancakes with some fruits. The blueberry pancakes came out as two large pieces with blueberries inside and an extra three on top. He ordered a side of potatoes. Being the assertive guy that he is, he asked for a completely new plate because the initial one was hotter than the potatoes themselves.  The waitress, whom I forgot her name, was very nice. She always made sure we enjoyed everything we had.  I would say that this Cheesecake Factory is good but not the best I've been to yet.

This quality of food is good, and the bread is delicious! I swear you could just have a meal with that!

C.F. should know they almost always get big groups of people. Our waiter was good in the beginning, but later started slacking. I ordered a Passion fruit mojito (which was REALLY GOOD, btw), but the server forgot to tell the bartender so I got it like 45 minutes late. I mean why don't they write it down or go tell the person ASAP?! Who did he think he told? The little man inside of his head?? Also, our server took a break in between so this other man took over and forgot to add the birthday cheesecake onto our order, and took FOREVER to get the other check which means we were just sitting there waiting for the check for a good 30 minutes.

It was extremely busy, which I understand, but that does not excuse unsanitary practices. When I first sat down, my fork was dirty. I excused that because I thought, hey I have two forks here I am not getting a salad I will just use the other one. Then, the dish that my ranch was brought out in had a used Splenda packet plastered to the side of it. I didn't notice this until I had already eaten the ranch. Needless to say I was thoroughly disgusted. Obviously the dish was either unwashed and reused, or the machine that washes the dishes is so ineffective that it leaves Splenda packets adhered to the side of everything. Whatever the explanation, it was absolutely disgusting. The fact that it made it all the way to my table escaping notice is just unsanitary.  I was unable to finish my meal and when I told the waiter he said ""hey that looks like a Splenda packet."" Yea, it does. He did not even offer any sort of consolation for the fact that I couldn't even finish my food.  If I had more time I would have complained to the manager, but I had to catch a train.

Not sure why but this one is not very appealing to me, it might just be that it looks like everything is all set up in a perfect order and you just have to get in and ride it like on a conveyor belt or something. It's too well structured and it follows a pattern, like there is no room to move or be a little outside of what they want you to be. Low and behold it was full so we sat at the bar, outside of the perfectly aligned tables, and it was OK. They have a full menu there and they have more items there now than before, we tried a few small plates and some beer on tap. The Samosas are good but nothing special, the crab cakes are good but nothing special, the fried cheese sticks are good, but I would say there is nothing special. And even though the tables were all taken and they had a long line at the door there were plenty of empty tables in the bar area, where they serve a full menu!

You cannot come here without having some cheesecake. I'm as vanilla as they get and whenever I want cheesecake, I have to go with The Original.

The first time I went we just got cheesecake at this location. A few months back we went to the MV location and they tried to seat us at a dirty table then realizing this moved us to another one once we were seated I looked at our silver wear and noticed green stuff in my fork wile my lady noticed lipstick still on her glass we were just over it and grossed out with how dirty it was so we walked out. The management ended up mailing us a gift card to come back because my lady complained to them hence why we went here for Halloween. Once seated it took quite a wile for them to ask us for drinks and even longer to get the drinks (Alcoholic and waters) once we finally got them my lady's water glass was half full when the server put it on the table kinda strange but okay the daiquiri I ordered wasn't bad but it definitely tasted virgin. For some reason they said they were out of bread and making more a good amount of time went by and once we got bread it wasn't fresh it was kinda cold definitely were lied to about that. About 45min or so passed from when we ordered food to when got it thats a really long time for pasta when its uncrowded. Both of our dishes were tasty and hot I just wish I could have ordered another drink our server never came back to check on us or to get us more drinks or even fill our water for that matter.

Christine Y.,"Irvine, CA",182,103,18,1.0,12/13/2014,"I'll preface this by saying I am usually left unsatisfied whenever I come here but there's such a large variety of menu options that I usually come back when I'm feeling indecisive. Since it was a Saturday evening, it was pretty packed. We were seated outside which was okay but, of course, people seated in the outdoor lounge areas were obnoxious. People clearly don't read the ""no smoking"" signs (think chain smokers that are just lounging without anything better to do on a Saturday night) and this older (mid to late 30s or maybe 40s) couple were making out (think soft porn.. I think I puked a little).  Now that you have an idea of the ambience, or lack thereof, on to the food and service. It was busy so I'll take it easy on the server. But when you run out of the brown bread, and double up on sourdough, make sure to bring the brown bread out when it's ready rather than me having to ask for it seeing other tables get served the usual brown and sour combo. THEN the server takes back the sourdough and comes out with a double up on brown. No, I didn't want any sourdough, thanks. Ugh. Then our food arrives, I ordered the chicken Alfredo. Big mistake. It had so much salt I literally drank 2.5 cups of water at the restaurant, ordered a strawberry lemonade to go (which I downed by the time I got back to my car) AND when I got to my next destination, I drank an entire Snapple.

All of the small bite appetizers we've tried are good too - and always brought out quickly.  For cocktails, try their manhattan - assuming you like bourbon.  Some places you can wait 10+ minutes to get your drink... not so at the Cheesecake Factory.  I won't go into detail on dessert choices... they aren't called the Cheesecake Factory for nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=600

I do like their desserts, however!  The cheesecake.  Their chocolate mousse cheesecake is soooo good, it is soooo good, I am trembling a little thinking of it right now, haha.  I prefer My Cheesecake factory cheese cake in frozen form though, I think it's way yummier that way. So, overall, if other places are closed and you don't have choices, then sure, try this place and you will get full.....the issue is full of what though, lol.  The food is just not great.  You would be wiser going somewhere else for the meal and just coming here for the dessert. :) Actually, I would suggest you go straight to the take out counter, which actually offers you the full menu to go, food as well as the desserts.  :)  So, just use that and don't wait forever for a table.  Who needs that?!  Also, you can get their cheesecakes by the whole cheesecake or half, I think, they will give them to you frozen when you order the whole one, yay, the way I love it, before they defrost it.  So, if feel like being badd and enjoying it, just get the whole chocolate mousse cheesecake to go....they have a million other cheesecake flavors, too.....I have tried a lot of the flavors over the years and that one remains My absolute favorite!  I think you can also get like a sampler cheesecake to go which has a few different kinds, which can be fun.  :)  They also have a low carb cheesecake which is good if you want to enjoy cheesecake and not be quite as naughty.  There are various other delicious desserts as well.  Their teramisu is quite creamy and yummy.  All their desserts are pretty good and pretty good size.  So, this place is good for some things and not for others.  Now you know, haha.  :)  Oh, and they are not economical.  Both the desserts and the food are not cheap by any means considering what you get.   But if cheesecake is what you crave, then do stop by the take out counter and get one to go.  Get a whole one, you can always give Me half of it or more, haha.  :)                                       ...XooX SuperGirl",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=900

Ok, coming back to the food...  They've got, like, 400 items on their menu, so you should order your drinks & savor their warm bread before you begin browsing their menu - its gonna be a while!

Be sure to go in a bit early, say 6-ish, in the evenings cuz they usually have a long queue.. but its worth the wait, trust me!

Last night a friend and I decided to walk back to the Spectrum and have coffee and cheesecake. We got there about 8:30 and were seated right away. We got a great table with a huge picture window that looked out onto the valet and was great to people watch from. Our server came by right away but was quick to tell us she wasn't our server and he would probably be around in half an hour. She took our drink order and came back. I ordered my typical double shot raspberry mocha. Took a sip and there was NO raspberry and luke warm milk. . . yuck! I didn't complain and just made the best of it. Next she went over there new specials and breezed through the menu but was quick to point out that she thought the Pot Pie on the menu was gross and it's been sent back a lot. Even though we knew dinner was on our agenda we were completely turned off. She made some good suggestions and brought our cheesecake. Never saw our mystery server. The other appetizing part was watching the servers out of our large picture windows going to take their smoke breaks. . .that was hot!

Sean M.,"San Francisco, CA",81,477,8,2.0,6/14/2008,"We came here on the night before my daughter graduated from college, a little tired from a long drive down and very hungry. Opening the door, a wave of music and conversation, louder than even the fabled Abercrombie and Fitch ear drum bursting levels greated us. We let the 20 something greater know how many in our party, he told us it would be 20 minutes wait to get a pager an another 45 minutes to get a table. I was for bailing, but my party really wanted to come here. So, wandered around, spent even more money and finally was sitted in a booth. Shouting as loud as I could, I asked for some ice tea, the waitress said ""passion fruit?"" I said no, regular, she says ""passion fruit?"" I say, no ""black tea!!""  Oh, we don't have regular tea, only passion fruit. Okay water? Right, water.  My daughters got shirley temples and their mother and my sister got passion fruit ice tea, they give up easily. On to the pot stickers, okay, light and not greasy, sort of what PF Chang would make if the chefs were Thai and not Mexican, but I checked the chefs were hispanic. So, I stuck with (sometimes literally) with the pulled pork sandwich, one daughter got some fetticini alfredo, the other a salad, the other parties a pizza and some soup. Unfortunaly, the meal didn't come with night vision goggles, so I could barely see my kids, my food or the other guests. The food arrives and its fine, not great but heavy, heavy and ultimatly not tasty. The fetticini was old with the noodles almost as crispy as hong kong style noodles, clam chowder bland and thick with milk and potatoes, not a clam to be seen and in the salad, my daughter found a hair which the manager swore was corn silk from the salad bar that must have slipped in and wasn't detectible except to the touch. Finally, the moment of truth, the cheescake. It was not what I expected, after the meal that was so heavy, I could use it to work out on, the cheese cake was not so much cake as meringe, very light. The cream cheese flavor came out once I scrapped away the buick sized hunk of whipped cream away. It was okay, but California light when what I really craved was New York heavy and authentic. 120 bucks out the door, we escaped, or at least, me and my wallet escaped.

It works coincidently, but every time I go for The Cheesecake Factory, it's been this one at Irvine Spectrum. It's a pretty pricey restaurant for pasta, but the decor, delightful service, and large amounts make it worth it. Really, their portions are HUGE so be cautious when each person in your party orders their own dish. My friends and I usually go family-style on this one and just order one dish from beginning to end: drinks, an appetizer, main dish, and cheesecake for dessert and just share everything. That way, we can have a little of everything! In terms of chain restaurants, Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites.

Being facebook groupies and social media fans we got a coupon for any slice of cheesecake for $1.50 - but the catch was to dine-in and to enjoy your slice of cake there. Not a problem!  We had been wanting to check out the new cheesecake to join the family - the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. The other cheesecake we enjoyed was the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. The Reese's cheesecake was overbearing of peanut butter goodness. If you're a peanut butter lover, and truly love everything Reese's Piece's this slice of cheesecake is perfect for you. It had a nice layer of chocolate cake on the bottom, Reese's cheesecake on the following layer, a heavy layer of caramel, and more Reese's cheesecake, then another layer of chocolate, and more cheesecake.. It's a gigantic slice of everything Reece's if you ask me. After trying it out, I thought it needed a hint of more chocolate and the caramel layer in the middle was a little too much...but seriously it never hurts to taste a cheesecake from here. All the cheesecakes are pretty fabulous - I've enjoyed many of the candy-themed cheesecakes. But one of my recent favorites is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake - it's just a beautiful melody of chocolate cake and cheesecake.

The wait is long during weekends, service is alright, and the food is seemly overpriced.. especially the cheesecake.  I guess if you're a guy going on a date with a girl it's an alright place to take her.. something mainstream and clean.  But if it's your girlfriend or wife there are much better and interesting places to eat around Irvine for much much cheaper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=700

On 12/16,  my wife & I went there for dessert,  we got there around 8:30pm,  waited for about 10 mins to be seated.  Everyone was very nice & friendly. I ordered the Fresh Strawberry Poundcake along with a Rasberry White Chocolate Latte,  & my wife ordered their 30 Yr Anniv cheesecake,  which had 2 layers each of chocolate cake & original cheesecake.  It's what you'd expect from Cheesecake Factory.  Good service,  good food.  Status quo. On 12/18,  we went to Cheesecake Factory after our horrible experience from Niko Niko Sushi,  please see that review. We came here after feeling like we needed to redeem our horrible dinner @ Niko Niko.  We ordered the Spinach Dip & the  Avocado Rolls for appetizers,  & I ordered the Fresh Strawberry Poundcake again (didn't quite get enough from Tue.)  My mother in law ordered the White Chocolate Rasberry Cheesecake.  Everything was delish as usual,  service was good.

Amanda A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/15/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory A famous American Eatery Marble columns, windows looking out onto the scenery, and great service are all great qualities to a restaurant. Adding up to all of these qualities includes The Cheesecake Factory, an American eatery. With close to one hundred and seventy locations in America, The Cheesecake Factory is a must go to restaurant. Many of the customers range from casual get togethers with friends to fancy dinner dates or celebrations. The brown decor on the inside adds a modern vibe to the hip bistro. With an affordable price range leading anywhere from $12 to $20, this place is always packed with people.  Being a no brainer, The Cheesecake Factory is most known for its signature cheesecake. Cheesecake flavors range from a tropical piña colada to a rich dark chocolate. Where most dessert menus list about five different options, the menu for cheesecake at this bistro includes around fifty different flavors of their rich and creamy cake. All in all, when you take a bite of the cheesecake, the creamy texture and rich flavors keep you coming back for more! Where dessert is the most popular dish on the menu, the appetizers are great for large parties. Appetizers set the mood for a restaurant leading the customer onto how the quality of the rest of their meal will be. The appetizer menu at The Cheesecake restaurant is filled with many delicious samplers. Fried Calamari is one of the most popular appetizers at many different restaurants, but once you get the calamari at The Cheesecake Factory you will never want to get it anywhere else! The savory calamari is lightly crisped giving it a wonderful texture, and to create a bursting of flavors in your mouth, it comes with a tangy garlic sauce. Another great appetizer is the Tex Mex Eggrolls. Being Hispanic, no Mexican dish compares to mother's cooking, yet this appetizer is absolutely to die for. The savory yet spicy chicken with cheese, beans, corn, and peppers go great with their avocado cream and salsa creating its own sensual party of the taste buds.  The Cheesecake Factory also has an enormous menu of delicious entrees. With large competitions from reigning pizzerias, The Cheesecake Factory puts up a good fight with their cheesy goodness. Consisting of dough, sauce, and cheese, this amazing bistro goes above and beyond when creating their pizza. When anyone can create a simple pizza pie, The Cheesecake Factory bakes them to utter perfection. Personally I would say that their Margherita pizza is their best including the fresh tomato and delicious basil baking until the flavors mold into each other making an aroma to for sure salivate your mouth. This restaurant deserves the gold medal for not only cheesecake but their amazing entrees too! This amazing restaurant is a favorite of mine that I would no doubt recommend. If your planning on a nice date or a casual get together this is the perfect bistro. All in all, the cheesecake makes the restaurant famous, but the food in general is adored across the nation. Therefore, the next time you come across The Cheesecake Factory don't mind dropping by, even if its just for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=840

Valerie B.,"Wildomar, CA",109,11,3,1.0,2/17/2013,"I was in Irvine overnight for a business trip. Met w/ a friend to have dinner while I was in town. Had dinner there on a Tuesday night (2/12) @ 7pm. Our service was TERRIBLE! The worst service I have ever received at Cheesecake Factory. I've been to CF many times in various locations throughout CA, this being my 1st time at the Irvine Spectrum and was very disappointed. I had high expectations, especially since the location was in such a nice area, many business professionals there and because typically they have good food and service. Our server took almost 25 min to take our order. We were not offered ANY refills on our beverages and worst of all, we only ordered 2 small appetizer salads and the small macaroni appetizer! Food took forever to get and when we did get it, the macaroni was cold! Perhaps the server had a bad day, but that is no exception to give such awful customer service. We were shocked that service was so bad and with no reason, especially because it was a Tuesday night! The place was not packed at all. When we got our bill, she never came by to collect it, so we stood up and had to look and wait around for a manager. When we complained to the manager (a younger lady) she didn't do anything abut it! She just said, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that."" UNBELIEVABLE! She didn't offer to comp our meal which was not even close to a $30 tab or offer us anything for the HORRIBLE and INEXCUSABLE service. I will never go back to this location again, and I'd rather go the other nearby restaurants to give my business to. I feel that server and that manager should get written up and counseled, especially the manager! She should go back and get trained/educated and how to deal with customers in giving exceptional customer service!

N L.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,109,33,2.0,7/9/2007,"We came to Cheesecake Factory for my Sis' early birthday dinner last night.  I've been to many different locations of this chain before, just never the one at the Spectrum.  Not that I think Cheesecake Factory is all that spectacular in general...but it's just a normal restaurant with basic foods to go for dinner and the option to have cheesecake for dessert (I do love cheesecake) if I feel up to it.  In any case, when we eat at the restaurant (regardless of the location) I do expect decent service and definitely a clean spot to sit on.  I've learned to check my seats before parking down my behind to enjoy my meal from past experiences.  Needless to say,  I was so disappointed with this place.  We were told to wait 5-10 minutes for a table when we arrived.  We ended up waiting 35 minutes.  Fine, no problem since it was just an estimate that they provide.  We were lead to a tiny table in the corner with huge people right next to the shared side, so instead of taking it, we asked the hostess if we can wait for a different table, maybe a booth.  She said she'll check and told us to wait.  But within 1 minute, she turned around to us and said follow her to the other side of the restaurant, there may be a booth over there.  Well, we got to the other side, and there were plenty of available seating.  Didn't understand why she wanted us to step back out to wait.  Okay, so we get a booth.  Once I sat down, I jumped back up almost immediately.  There were what looked like dried up, caked-on mash potatoes smeared on my side of  the wall where I was going to lean my purse against.  SEE the PHOTO I took. (Is it just moi or something?  Do I have ""pick me"" written on my forehead?!  Lately I've just had the worst luck with service, food, cleanliness, etc... when I eat out!).  I asked our waitress to get someone to come with a rag to wipe it down.  She didn't look too happy to begin with (bad attitude!) and gave me a weird look.  The bus boy came to wipe the wall down but didn't bother with the debris and the food particles that fell onto my seat, just left quickly.  I sat almost to the edge of the opposite side, feeling really gross about it and looking around for our waitress to come back.  But finally the manager (I think) noticed something was wrong and asked me what's the matter, so I told him I wanted to change to another table.  I wasn't trying to be difficult, I just wanted a clean spot to sit to enjoy my din-din with my sis!!  He immediately took us to a bigger, cleaner booth only an aisle away.  Now I was happy, and with a different waiter, yeah!  Two minutes after we sat down, our waiter brings that same waitress from the dirty booth over to introduce to us, telling us she will be covering for him while he goes on break.  Great... same bad, lame attitude.  Okay, so we order (drinks and dinner) from her.  I say I want water with lemon, she forgets the lemon.  Then I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon with lemon sauce, asked for extra sauce on the side. Then she repeats my order and says ""no sauce"".  WTF!  Lady, wake up!  She was stoned or something!  I said extra sauce!  How do you eat that dish with no sauce?  Mind you, her section pretty much  was empty, not busy at all.  Btw, I get this dish a lot and I've never had one quite this odd and below standard.  They must have run out of herbs or got a rookie chef!  The ""herb"" was very wet and was simply slapped onto the salmon. The ""herb"" was just chopped up wet parsley!  What crusted herbs? The asparagus that came with the dish were wet and limp, not fresh at all.  They had the nerve to serve it that way.  Amazing.   The Louisiana Chicken pasta seemed okay but our Chopped Salad was drenched with dressing served on a warm plate.  Not that appealing.  I wonder why a chain restaurant fails to have consistency at what they make daily.  Btw, that waitress never came back to check on us.  Our waiter came back only shortly before we were done with dinner.  No dessert there, wanted to get out fast.  However, I did get a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to-go.  The cheesecake is good, thus the 2 stars.

Debbie M.,"Orange County, CA",435,122,14,2.0,6/19/2009,"I was a bit hestiant about writing reviews about ""chained"" restaurants, but in this case, I think this restaurant deserves a review for my experience today. Generally, the portions are large enough to feed two people (unless you order from the limited lunch menu). There is a large crowd for lunch, normally local business people working around the Spectrum. I'd advise you to arrive here around 11:30 to avoid a long wait time. My take on Cheesecake Factory in general is that the cost per dish is pretty pricey - avg $15/dish. I've never really understood why people loved this place so much. Yes, there are some good dishes, notably the avocado egg rolls, miso salmon, and cheesecake, but I never thought that other dishes were that good...well for the price that is.  I didn't see much ""value"" in the dish.  Now about my review of this particular location - My water mug had some weird unknown object stuck to the inside where the water was. Both of my forks and my friend's fork still had food stuck on it. In addition, my favorite bread was burnt.  I find these things unacceptable. It shows me that their kitchen isn't properly washing the dishes nor is there quality check on the silverware or bread. For a restaurant to not be able to get the basics down, I question the operation of the business.  I wasn't mad at the waiter, he didn't do anything wrong so the level of service was okay.

Sam G.,"Atlanta, GA",312,31,1,2.0,1/23/2011,"I had lunch at this Cheesecake factory location early last week with my partner and have to say we were both shocked at the poor service we received. My partner ordered the same salad he gets almost every visit to a Cheesecake Factory, the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. He asked for extra chicken and for the dressing on the side. I ordered the club sandwich and substituted sweet potato fries instead of regular fries. Our meals arrive, while I am sitting with an empty glass of tea, and both orders are wrong. Mine was a minor error. They brought regular fries and had to return with sweet potato fries. His salad, at first glance, had 2 small problems, no extra chicken and no dressing on the side. We explained all this to the runner who brought our plates out and she first said she was sure he had received extra chicken but would take it back to the kitchen to check. A different runner returned with my fries and his salad that now had extra chicken. We then had to ask again for the dressing. They finally returned with that and then our server stopped by. We told her we were OK but a little disappointed that both meals arrived incorrect and that we needed more tea. We were VERY polite about the situation and did not even tell her that one of the runners had a lot of attitude. Once my partner begins eating his salad he learns that they added apple and avocado to his salad. He first overlooked it and tried to eat it until he found 8-10 pieces of apple and more avocado. When the server returned he told her what he discovered and she said she was sure the salad came with those items. We then asked for a manager because we knew she was completely wrong. When the manager arrived he instantly had bad attitude. He began to explain that when they are mixing salads in the back ""lots of things are flying"" and ""sometimes other ingredients land in the wrong salad"". I told him that was unacceptable under any condition. This is not a $4 Subway salad we are talking about. They charge $15 for salads like this at Cheesecake Factory and we expect them to get it right. What about customers with food allergies?? Are they supposed to keep their EpiPen close by in case they get an ingredient that they are allergic to ""that was flying around"" in the back. I would think that the liability and basic customer satisfaction would be enough to make sure people GET WHAT THEY ORDER! In the end we had to ask for the salad to be taken off of our bill and the manager was TOTALLY not the kind of Cheesecake Factory trained employee we were used to dealing with. We both normally love this chain and eat there several times a month. Now that we moved to this area and this location is the closest to our home, we will be rethinking that and will likely not be returning. We expect to get what we pay for and at this CF location we simply did not get that.  The biggest problem here is poor management.  The manager's poor attitude and lack of consideration for customer satisfaction is clearly reflected in his employees' poor performance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=880

Their meals are always in HUGE portions, so I make sure to always share a meal with whomever I go with! Since I work right across the street, it's a great place to have friends meet me for after-work drinks and/or dinner. They staff is usually friendly, though they always seem to be super busy and short-handed whenever I go. Even though there's usually a wait (approx 15 mins beginning around 5:30pm to as high as 2 1/2 hours later on) the food is worth it! I love to start with the avocado egg rolls (mmmm::SALIVATING::mmmm) and a side salad.  The great part about their menu is that everyone can find something they like and want off of it. From my lactose-intolerant father to my vegetarian sister, and all us foodies in-between, it's a great place for cocktails and celebrations! I like that they added the small dishes (tapas) menu as well because the corncakes and stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks are AMAZING!!!! :)  Yeah some dishes are a little pricey, but overall it's a great restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=880

But no, don't expect anything from the horrible manager that worked on Monday September 20, 2010. He was a huge jerk. We had a coupon for a free cheesecake but he wouldn't let us use it because it apparently wasn't good 'til next week. Also, they supposedly had happy hour when we were there, but because there were 10 of us and we wanted to sit outside, he wouldn't let us buy the drinks at the happy hour price and sit outside with them. The angry stain covered tie manager came and just said, no he can't do anything for us. No apologies, no thank you so much for bringing in a big group of people but f- you. Pretty much just told us no and walked back in. No smiles or anything. Really hope that manager gets fired.

The ambiance at this restaurant is pleasant and I'd recommend dining off of peak hours.   Head in on a weekday for dinner or lunch and things are a little less rowdy, and you get to appreciate the place a little more.  If you go on a weekend for dinner expect there to be huge crowds in the waiting area, lots of noise,  and a long wait---usually an hour plus.   As far as the seating itself goes I prefer the high tables in the bar area.  They are first come-first serve and this space feels more open than the regular dining area.  If you like eating outdoors they have a patio which is nice as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=780

They brought us the artichoke appetizer and it was cut in quarters I was eating mine and my wife was eating part of hers when she stops suddenly and says I am through let's get out of here. I ask her what was wrong and she says lift up one of the leaves which I did and there was about an inch long caterpillar/worm partially cooked but still moving.  She wanted to leave immediately which I understood, but I convinced her to stay and called the waiter to remove the artichoke. A couple of minutes later the restaurant manager came by with a rather patronizing smile on his face and said sorry about that would you like another artichoke I'll remove this one from your bill.  No apologies, no embarrassment, no what can I do to turn this into a better evening for you, just that smile like it was really funny.  I said no to the artichoke and he was gone. I didn't want our dinner comped nor did we ask, but a little offer of something like a slice of cheesecake for desert would have been nice touch or at least an apology neither of which we got.  I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory at least 50 times but haven't been there lately and if this is the way the new management acts and treats it customers I won't be back.   In closing I work at and am one of the managers of a retail business and if I ever caught any of our managers acting like he thought a customers problem was a joke and didn't offer some sort or apology, try to find a solution to the problem, offer a small gift of appreciation, or something else to take the unpleasantness out of the situation he would be facing some serious customer satisfaction training or would be looking elsewhere for work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=780

The decor was pretty cool. I found myself admiring the walls and paintings even as we were leaving. Very neat. We were seated quickly for a party of 7 adults and 3 kids. I don't even think we waited 5 minutes! Service was quick and efficient. Our server was very friendly. I was pretty happy with her. Their Roadside sliders were delicious! I had a Veggie garden salad with chicken which was gigantic, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The hubby had the fish tacos which had an excellent sauce. Kids had a kids cheese and pepperoni pizza which they ate but didn't really like the cheese. I thought they were being picky, but I tried it and I didn't like it either.  It was my brother's birthday so we asked for something special for him, and I think we all thought they would have something complimentary for him, but they took our dessert order (a mango cheesecake) and put Happy Birthday on that. We all shared it, which was the original plan, but we thought the birthday boy would get something just for him. Oh well. They also didn't have any crayons or coloring pages for the kiddos.

We were told about 35 Min's. Our lil pager starts buzzing - we get up and head to the counter, they tell us to wait in the bar now. Ummm we had seats in the lobby! So the pager was only to move us to the stage 2 holding area.  50 Min's later were seated. We were ready to order since we asked for a menu while waiting. But our waiter was busy.  I felt like breakfast so I ordered the Spinach, Bacon, Mushroom Omelette's w/ potato's and English muffin. Got our food like 25 Min's later. My omelet did taste right, it was like they used eggs from a carton and not real eggs. The bacon was soggy and chewy, kinda like the bacon you get from McDonald's. I for one like my bacon crispy. The English muffin was good, as were the potato's.  Midway thru dinner I slipped my credit card to the waiter so he can get that done as we only had 30 Min's to finish our meal and get over to the improv. well he didn't. he waited til we were done, went thru the whole cheesecake menu.

The restaurant is very well staffed to deal with the high traffic. WAIT TIME: Expect to wait a lot during peak hours.  SERVICE: Good to Very Good most of the time. Once in a while Excellent, and very rarely Poor. MENU: Very broad range of selections, although mostly american, you will find Mexican and Asian selections. FOOD: I have tried too many dishes to even name, although I highly recommend: - Thai Lettuce Wraps (Appetizer) - Chinese Chicken Salad (warning it is huge, you can order the smaller lunch portion though) - Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp - Blackened Chicken Sandwich (relatively cheap and great) - Charbroiled Flat Iron Steak - Carne Asada Skirt Steak - Terriyaki Chicken (excellent quality) - Pasta with Meat Sauce (rivals some authentic Italian Bologneses!) Cheesecake Factory claims their Jambalaya is their most popular dish. I have tried it once. Tried it twice, just to be sure.... but I do not see the big deal?

Rachel V.,"Riverside, CA",13,20,,2.0,1/27/2011,"A couple months ago my significant other and I decided to go buy a slice of cheesecake and therefore went to this Cheesecake Factory location since we were in close proximity. I ordered the slice (Key Lime Pie) and paid for it. I stepped out of the line as I was suppose to. I was expecting to get some form of call or waive allowing us to know that the order was ready. Several minutes after I paid we were waiting, waiting, and waiting... no call. Approximately 8 minutes passed and still no call or anything of that sort. I looked around me and saw other people waiting for (I'm assuming) an order as well. They looked confused as I did. Finally, after approximately 12 minutes I went in the line and waited another 6 minutes to be helped and I told the cashier (the same cashier that helped me earlier) that my order had not been taken into account. He asked me what I had ordered, and therefore I told him. Immediately, he handed me a small bag that was next to him all along (yes, I witnessed that bag since ""decades"" ago). I asked him, ""So, next time I order something from you guys (If I ever do) what do I have to do in order to receive my order in a timely manner? Do I have to go in line and ask for it myself?"" His answer was, ""Yes"". He had no expression on his face and made it obvious that I had to step aside in order for him to assist the next customer. Wow, what a pleasant experience, and what amazing customer service?! So... to my fellow Yelpers, if you ever decide to order an overpriced slice of cheesecake or an amazingly overpriced jelly from this Cheesecake Factory location - Go back in line AFTER you pay for your order, because apparently YOU make the estimate of when your order is ready for pick up (Yes, you need to make line twice. One to order/pay and the second to pick up, that is after your assumption of your order's completion). This is some advice from me (a kind person) for the purpose of saving you approximately 18 minutes of your experience at this Cheesecake Factory location. You're welcome.

Matthew T.,"Irvine, CA",3,21,,5.0,3/7/2009,"Hahaha, I have to laugh seeing how bad the reviews are for the Irvine Spectrum Cheesecake Factory when this is consistently the most crowded, most popular restaurant in the Spectrum. I could try to be one of the ""cool kids"" and pan Cheesecake in favor of the quirky, hidden away places, but let's face it: Cheesecake Factory dominates the restaurant business for some pretty good reasons. Their menu is large, has a lot of variety, and nearly all the choices are consistently good.  Cheesecake Factory pasta is better than most dedicated Italian food restaurants. Everything from their salads to their desserts is great, and while other restaurants might have them beat in some areas, no other place is strong is such a wide variety of kinds of food. The atmosphere is better than most alternatives, and the service is above average. The Spectrum location can probably hold on to some of the better talent in the area, though service can be inconsistent like anywhere else. As for the food, personal favorites are the Crabcake Sandwich, almost all of their Pastas, and the Strawberry Shortcake dessert. Another thing many people don't realize about Cheesecake Factory is that it is one of the few places you can go for breakfast, and probably the only nice place you can go for breakfast in the area. It also has additional breakfast choices on Sundays until 2pm. The bread here is good too, and considering the bread and large portions for entrées, even if you share an entrée, it can be difficult to save room for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=780

Again!?!?  So again, I had to wait a long time in the restaurant to get my order.   All I have to say is, keep note of what happened, complain to the right people, and they may give you something for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=760

Payam A.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,18,,1.0,12/9/2014,"Really don't like leaving negative reviews but had to let you know what an unbelievably poor experience we had! We ordered our food and waited a long time. OK, it was a busy weekend night. When the food finally arrived, we had no silverware. We wanted to let our server know, but she was in a real rush and ran off before we could explain what we needed. After that we waved to her a couple more times, but she was too busy to respond. We waved down another server who came by and said he would make sure we got our silverware immdiately, but we never saw him again. We waved down a third server, but he said he would let our server know immediately and she was the one who had to take care of our table. We were very frustrated after around 10 minutes of this, my friend got up and walked to the serving station which was only three tables away from us and was confronted by a bus-boy. He was told to go and sit down as 'guests' were not allowed to take silverware or napkins, they had to be deliverd by an employee. He tapped the bus-boy on the shoulder and laughingly told him we had waited for over ten minutes. He was sternly told to sit at his table and they would be brought soon. He returned a little shaken up and surprised at the experience. Almost 4 minutes later, the cutlery arrived, and we finally got to eat our food, which by now of course, was quite cold. My friend asked for a whole lemon so that it would not squirt everywhere when he squeeze it for the juice, and was told he would have to pay extra for it. My friend was surprised and said that was not right. A few minutes later, the manager arrived. I thought, 'good, he found out about our cutlery problem and is here to apologize'. Well here was the real shocker! He began to shout at us, telling my friend if he wanted a whole lemon he had to pay extra and then he started shouting that my friend had no right to touch an employee, and every time my friend tried to explain, he was immediately and aggressively interrupted and shouted down by the manager. I could not believe what was happening. Then I tried to talk too and the manager kept shouting saying if we didn't like it, we could leave! We were both in absolute shock and disbelief at what was happening and how we were being treated. Everyone within several tables of us, was now staring in our direction and at the spectacle. Completely embarrased and publicly humiliated, my friend agreed to pay extra for the lemon and the manager left in a huff. Our server was very apologetic and said she had no idea he was going to react that way. We had completely lost our appetite and could not eat anymore. We had barely eaten any of our food, and when the lemon arrived with more apologies from our server we just asked for the bill and our waitress brought it quickly and just kept on apologizing. We had spent over $80 on food we hadn't eaten and had been treated worse than criminals! Guests sitting at the tables around us said they were shocked at how poorly we had been treated, and would never come to this restaurant again. Two other guests, came by as they were leaving and voiced the same thing. One said the manager was a real bully and should be fired for what he had done. We got out of there with a horrible sick feeling. It ruined my whole weekend. Couldn't get the stress and embarrasment out of my head. I wrote to their corporate offices to let them know everything is not alright with their Irvine Spectrum restaurant. Have no desire to ever visit any Cheesecake factory again!

Server was nice and helpful. However, bread arrived microwaved. Ordered chicken Marsala and spicy chicken sandwich. Pasta was microwaved. Sandwich was called spicy chicken, but there was no spiciness. There was suppose to be buffalo sauce, I could barely see it, I certainly couldn't taste it. Instead, there was a cup of sauce on the side that was a mixture of blue cheese, sour cream, mayo etc. i think the sandwich missed the point of 'buffalo' and 'spicy' in its name. One slice of tomato with a some shredded lettuce on the side. The glam burger was not that glamorous. Wendy's spicy chicken burger tasted better than this!

County so we thought this would be a good half-way point to meet up.  The restaurant website says they can easily accommodate large parties so we sent out the invitations.  A week before the dinner, we tried to make a reservation for 26 (yeah, we have a large family).  We were told they do not accept reservations but if a member of our party came about an hour before we'd like to be seated, it shouldn't be a problem.  You can probably guess what happened... upon my daugher's arrival at 5:30, the manager denied any employee would have instructed us as they did (insinuating that she was lying), said they really aren't equipped to handle large parties (so why does their website say otherwise?) but they would do their best to accommodate us, and to come back in an hour to check on things.  She actually seemed annoyed that we had a large party.   LOOOONG story short (literally), the servers were attentive, the food was excellent, but don't go here if you're hungry, and definitely don't go here if you have a large party unless you're willing to wait several hours to be seated.  We were finally seated at 9:00.  Our extremely long wait was not even acknowledged when were eventually seated.  They DO NOT easily accommodate large parties and the message we received loud and clear was that they certainly do not welcome large parties, no matter what you're told over the phone and in spite of what their website states.   If we had just been told the truth when we called the week before, we would have had the time to make other arrangements with a restaurant better equipped to handle our party.  Perhaps the person answering the phone needs additional training and the restaurant website requires updating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=760

Today, I was informed a slice of cheesecake is half off and if you choose their new Red Velvet cheesecake, 25 cents goes to a Hunger Foundation. Any way to assist in changing the world, I am definitely there.  We went here for happy hour and was surprised they had some pretty good bar menu items. The price ranges from $3.95 -$4.95. We ordered the avocado egg, Cuban sandwiches, Thai chicken wraps, and fried mac and cheese. I know, it sounds like a lot of food, but the bar menus are small portions so you can have a sample of almost everything if you wanted to. Everything was pretty good. We definitely filled up our tummies.  As I mentioned earlier, we came here because of the half off cheesecake today and we did order the Red Velvet. The Red Velvet was moist, silky and so heavenly. I was afraid it would be too sweet but it wasn't at all. It tasted like the red velvet cupcake at Sprinkles. YUM!  I hope they do this promotion again, I will definitely be back for some half off cheesecake. On a side note, it seems that this Cheesecake factory lowered their standards.

Erika G.,"Orange, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/4/2015,"Let me start off by saying that I wouldn't be writing this had the awful management team Including Dan and Erica Edwards followed through with their word in correcting this awful experience. On Sat Jan 24th  my husband, 10 month old baby and myself attempted to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum. We checked in at 7pm and were told it would be about 35 minute wait. After an hour, I go check what is happening only to find out they cant find my name in the computer even though I have a pager in my hand. I was asked to wait a few more minutes for them to clear off the next available table in the patio. 15 Minutes later after watching other people get seated, I once again go ask what is happening. It is now 8:30PM. We finally get seated. order our food...and an hour later, after everyone around us has been seated, fed and brought the check, we STILL had no food. So needless to say at now 9:30pm, as our 10 month old has had it and our evening is ruined we get up to leave without dinner and the waitress has the odacity to give us attitude. Upon our departure I ask to speak with the manager, out comes Erica Edwards who apparently was too busy to handle the situation at that moment and asked for my name and number so she can call later that night to discuss how the Cheesecake Factory would handle this. Well apparently their customers are not important as she never called. A few days later I called there and asked to speak with the General Manager, I was put on the phone with Dan who was very apologetic, and sounded like he was genuine and offered to send us a gift card to come back and give them another try. Well , here we are two weeks later and have not received a call, a card or a slight acknowledgement from anyone at this location.

Usually the wait staff is so on top of things we are always asked if we want something but this girl had us waiting and longing.

Elaine H.,"Paris, France",19,22,1,2.0,9/6/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is a little overrated. There's always a huge line, which gives the allusion that it's a great place, even though the food is only mediocre. I have nonetheless continued to go even though I know it's not the best food ever. Maybe it's the dim lighting and plush seats? I've had many different dishes here, but I'll just write about three. One is chicken marsala, which is apparently one of their most popular dishes. I got it with angel hair pasta; maybe that was a mistake. I hated the sauce! It had this really odd sensation when it went down my throat, like it was burning. It made me feel sick after eating it. It's a brown-wine sauce, so that may be it, but I highly do not recommend it. I've also had a combination meal before, of steak diane and shrimp scampi that came with mashed potatoes. The steak was decent; make sure you get it medium or so because it came out a little bit tough. The sauce on the steak with the mushrooms was excellent, however. The shrimp scampi was also very good, and the sauce was just the way I like it: rich and tangy, and it also had some fresh tomatoes in it. The mashed potatoes are thick and creamy. Lastly, the cheesecake. This is something that they always get right. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is amazing! Please try it, you won't regret it. It is, however, very chocolate-y and dense.  Even though some of the things at cheesecake are not that bad, it's really hit or miss.

This past Christmas, he wanted something more upscale in the chain families...so we settled on Cheesecake Factory.   We got there at 6PM and were told the wait was 50-70 minutes.  No problem, we just walked around the Spectrum for 50 minutes and came back.  We made sure to check-in when we got back to make sure they didn't already call our name...check, we were third on the list.  Minutes turned into almost an hour and we checked back in.  The hostess said they paged us, but no one answered.  This did not sit well with my brother because a two hour wait for a table in NY meant that Mario Batali was stopping by your table. We barely touched our food because of the Wetzel's pretzels we ended up eating from the long wait...which, by the way, I would give a higher rating to.  The only saving grace of this place was the tag-team service, which had us leaving with a smile (surprisingly).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=820

I love Cheesecake Factory as I often crave their Pasta Carbonara since it's comforting that I know how it will taste every single time.  The service at this location was quite slow. The floor under the table still had remnants of big pieces of bread and goldfish scattered amongst other food all over from the party before. My friend ordered the vegan cobb salad with dressing on the side and added chicken. The first time they brought it out, there was no chicken, and the salad was already dressed.  The carbonara was pretty average but I feel like it was a little saltier than normal and not as creamy as other locations. Some of the pasta was burnt together like it had been stuck to the bottom of the pan too long when being sauteed in the sauce.  Overall, I am not sure if I would come back to this specific location as the wait time to order was long, the food prepared wasn't up to par with other locations, and also not as clean as other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20
Oankar A.,"Reading, PA",41,45,45,4.0,8/15/2017,"We visited them last christmas. Cheesecakes here are amazingly delicious!  we tried the godiva cheesecake and liked it so got another one as to-go! Staff is nice, courteous  and is constantly checking-up for any assistance. Parking can be a issue sometimes but still its definately a worth to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20
Michelle R.,"Del Mar, CA",327,78,226,4.0,1/1/2018,"Came in for lunch on New Years Eve and we got seated within 5 minutes. There was 7 of us and a baby. First off, our server, Ashley was amazing. Very sweet and on it. Our food was brought out at the same time. Everything was how we ordered it and delicious. I wish I took pictures of our food but I was a little busy with all the kids. I had brought my own avocado for my hungry baby and when I cut it open it was bad. Ashley didn't hesitate and right away said I will bring out a fresh avocado.  I didn't even have to ask.  Three of us had the burgers which we all finished and enjoyed. One salad, a kids corn dogs, a kid pasta and one half turkey and soup. I enjoyed my burger. It was so filling I couldn't finish it as hard as I tried. I don't eat them often so it was a real treat for me.  I don't live near, but will I be back? Absolutely and hopefully I get Ashley again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20
Archie S.,"Lake Forest, CA",616,455,512,4.0,3/12/2017,This is probably the first Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to almost 18 years ago. Somehow it still is in great shape at the Irvine spectrum. I always sit in the bar area since there's usually not much of a wait because this place can get pretty packed with the wait time sometimes over and hour.  The location is very clean and service is standard and consistent with all the other locations. I tried their chicken and shrimp pineapple curry (I think that's the name) out of the new featured items. It was tasty! You get to pick white or brown rice with it. The chicken and shrimp were crispy and flavorful and the peas really gave it a nice texture. I followed the entree with a slice of mango key lime pie and it was just what I needed to be fully satisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20
Arlee B.,"Portland, OR",4,33,2,1.0,12/17/2017,"Hey yelp, can you please allow us to give zero stars?  This was the worst experience ever! We were told 1-1.5 hrs and 3 hours later we were still not seated. 1.5 hours in they made us close our tab at the bar because, ""we were going to be seated soon"". Then it took us 30 minutes to get a tab opened again. At that point they offered us appetizers and it took 45 minutes. They were rude the entire time and were barely apologetic!!  At the 3 hour mark we walked out with our appetizers thank you very much!  We are a group of business leaders that specialize in customer service and this entire experience made us cringe.

MadaCy S.,"Riverside, CA",0,33,14,1.0,12/17/2017,"We understood we were a large party and we're okay with the wait.  However, when you tell us it's going to be an hour wait, and an hour turns into 2.5 hours, that's when patience is out the window.  Spoke to the manager who seemed not to care about the fact that we had waited and, in fact, had a pregnant woman in our party that had been waiting to eat.  First and last time coming back to this location again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20

Ryan H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",706,250,518,3.0,4/4/2017,"Came in for a late dinner around 8:40pm Service started a little slow, but it got a lot better once we ordered. We got the avocado egg roll, margarita pizza, and Godiva Cheesecake. Avocado egg rolls are freaking amazing!! The creamy avocado contrasts well with the crispy wrapping. The sweet sauce it comes with makes it even better! 5/5. Margarita pizza was terrible 1/5. Tasted like a cheesy bread. The cheese was chewy, sauce nonexistent-barely any. No tomatoes on the pizza. Only positive was the crust had a nice crust. Godiva cheesecake was not for me 3/5. It is extremely rich and the chocolate all blends together. Couldn't really taste the distinction between the mouse, cheesecake, and chocolate cake layers. There was only a texture difference. If you love chocolate and I mean LOVE chocolate this is probably for you...I guess I don't love chocolate as much as I thought I did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20

Edgar S.,"La Puente, CA",17,62,,4.0,12/2/2017,"Came here last month with my partner before we went to see a movie. We were just a party of two and were seated very quickly. Our server that evening (didn't catch his name) was excellent. Never had my glass of water go empty, he was always attentive if we needed something. Our food came in quickly, maybe 10 minutes after ordering. The section where we stayed at was a bit dark; granted it was near the bar area but still. They lit a candle at our table half way through the evening, but still it was dark though. That cheesecake though, oh it is to die far! Couldn't resist ordering it, and oh it is worth every bite. Overall had a pleasant experience and would come back here again if I'm ever back at the Irvine Spectrum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20

J A.,"Orange County, CA",192,336,32,3.0,9/24/2017,"This review is for the day I went in to order Take Out. I went in, ordered my food by the Cheesecake section (that's where you order take out). The front area vibe was ok. Not too bad. I ordered my favorite on the Menu, which was the Orange Chicken Special. I did wait about 30 minutes to get my food (which was a little bummer since I could not finish the meal prior to entering work nearby). The only complaint I have is the parking. It is so difficult to find parking and it is quite a distance from my work to walk. The take out parking, where they bring the food out to you, always has vehicles or food trucks parked there. So I have refrained from ordering ahead as this can be an issue. But overall, the food is great. I love the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20
Cam C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",521,579,974,4.0,11/13/2016,"Let's be real, all Cheesecake Factories are essentially the same. Crazy big place with a massive menu, and delicious complimentary bread and butter. So my review is based solely on service and wait time and I had no complaints. We were seated as soon as our entire party arrived, waiter was outgoing and friendly, and our bread/water was constantly refilled. Food itself was good, as usual. It's kind of loud in there, but you're there for the gigantic portions and cheesecake, not the ambiance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20
Ting Ting W.,"Irvine, CA",200,137,86,4.0,10/22/2017,"My boyfriend and I love coming here. It's right across the street from where we live and they have such an extensive menu so there's always something you might be craving for. I love their new patio, it's a great addition to the restaurant that they didn't have for years. I love sitting outside, it's spacious and has a great atmosphere.  My favorite dish to get here is their pasta davinci. It's so good and addicting. Love the penne pasta with chicken and mushroom in that Marsala sauce.  I also really like their strawberry Martinis that they make with fresh puréed strawberries.  Don't forget a slice of cheesecake at the end. It's nice that they don't make their cheesecakes too sweet either. Delish!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=20

Diana B.,"Orange County, CA",636,241,561,4.0,5/16/2015,"Same as other locations, great food with great friends for a great price. Ambience: --For some reason, I thought this restaurant was a little brighter than their chain counterparts, but I could be wrong. Probably because I was sitting closer to the Hostess Stand instead of deep into the restaurant. Service: --Excellent as always. As the hostess was walking the guests to their table, she asked everyone how they were doing and if they were having a nice day. Our server was super nice as well; he always came around to refill our waters and asked if we wanted more bread. Food: --All their dishes are large enough to share between two people. --Two words: brown bread. The bread is always fresh and warm and the butter just melts when you spread it on. Delicious. --Salmon Genovese: Salmon topped on a pesto sauce with pasta balls and sun dried tomatoes. OMG. I did not think that I would like this dish as much as I did. The sun-dried tomatoes add a perfect touch to the pesto sauce. The pasta balls were on the firmer side but I prefer to have them softer. --Chicken Alfredo: your typical chicken Alfredo just like at any other restaurant They grate actual parmesan cheese on it so if you put a lot, there's that cheesy string of cheese throughout the plate whenever you pick up a bite. Dessert: --Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake: Definitely can't go wrong with this one. It's their infamous cheesecake with 3 fresh strawberries on top. It adds a great touch and freshness to the cheesecake. It might look small, but it's very filling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=160

We went to this location and had a lunch special and asked the waiter what sides were offered and he told us, but neglected to tell us that the side we picked (Caesar salad) was a dollar per plate more. He should have said, ""If you like a Caesar it would be more"" but didn't. Also the food was cold when we got it and the waiter complained that he had too many tables. I'm not a fan of CCF anymore.

Also apparently they don't need to tell you when they will charge you extra. They'll just do it. Manager was really snippy and rude. Just came back and overcharged me AGAIN.  What a night mare. Charged me and my date $38 when that was the whole tab. Charged twice?? Anna Rodriguez is the worst manager.

It came out with very little salmon and wasn't crusted. We complained to manager and they replaced it but argued, actually argued, about taking it off the check!!!

Ryan W.,"Torrance, CA",863,710,2912,1.0,11/24/2015,"WOW... It's hard to even explain my visit to this Cheesecake Factory location.. It really was that bad. We came here for lunch on a Saturday. We were excited since it only took a few minutes to get seated and we were all hungry. Once we were seated it already took a few minutes for our server to come and get our drink order. It took even longer for the drinks and bread to come out. After a few more minutes we finally put in our order. I ordered the Renee's Special which one-Half of a Fresh Turkey Sandwich or Chicken-Almond Salad Sandwich, a cup of soup and a small salad. I asked our waitress which sandwich was more popular and she tells me the chicken-almond sandwich is a lot better so I said I'll take that one. The soup for that day was the loaded potato soup. We also ordered the carbonara and the egg roll sampler.  IT TOOK AN HOUR FOR OUR FOOD TO COME OUT!!! Why?!?!? I have no idea... No apology for it taking so long. No refills on our drinks until we ask. Simply ridiculous. We even asked a random employee if we can get more water and bread and she just looked at us and said ""you can ask your waitress for that"". Seriously?  The thing that I found to be even more ridiculous was that they gave me a turkey sandwich when I clearly said that I would want the chicken-almond salad sandwich. I have never complained to a manager on site, but I wanted to so bad. I was going to say something, but I did not want to wait another hour for them to make the correct sandwich.  Absolutely horrible food and service at this location.

Waitress: ""That's a lot of food.... Just letting you know..."" Us: ""Uhhh, its okay, we'll probably just take some home."" After she leaves..  Me: ""Yeah, I can finish it all."" -.- And that I did.

It's very sweet and I could only eat half so I took it home and had dessert for the next night.  The service here is always good and I can't complain.

Salted Caramel Cheesecake: first time ordering a cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory...they have so many to choose from, but decided on this one. Blonde brownie on bottom, then the caramel cheesecake, then the caramel mousse, and then topped off with salted caramel.  A little bit on the sweeter side and I wished it had just a little bit more of the salted caramel part. The brownie part I could do without, but everything else was delicious! 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: higher ups wanted something that was like a chocolate cake, but yet a cheesecake so...servers recommended this cheesecake!

The food is simply not worth the price of admission or the hassle of slow service. The food quality is almost fine, although in that jack of all trades master of none signature style. As for my meal, they managed to forget half the ingredients in a 4 ingredient sandwich, and of course everyone in the party had finished long before it could  be rectified. Ultimately, they don't care about your patronage and aren't afraid to let it show. Good for them, but I obviously would only return under extreme duress.

Tifania N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",534,51,84,5.0,8/31/2016,"Ok so when I say that I've eaten at cheesecake factory, well over 250 times, I'm not joking you. My family literally eats here at least 1-2 times a week every week since I was little. I've stopped going that much, but my parents still go on the weekly. My brother was a waiter there. My parents know every server and manager, we even know the one in Dubai. They seat us before everyone if the line is long and they greet us when we come in because they know my parents. So I guess you could call me a Cheesecake Factory connoisseur  and this review is way over due. It's a rare occurrence if you open up our fridge and don't find a Cheesecake Factory box in there. I've tried almost every item on the menu, but I'm gonna go over some of my favorites and some menu hacks that I think are great.  First of all I only ask for the brown bread when I start, it's just better to me but that's a personal preference. Also I always ask for ranch dressing to dip the bread in when the waiter comes to the table. Sometimes my om will put butter on the brown bread and brown sugar and it's also delicious. Also remember that if the line is long you can seat yourself anywhere in the bar and the wait is never that long. The new patio here is beautiful too.  The best appetizers:  1. The Thai chicken lettuce wraps are amazing, i always used to order them as my main entree.  2. The Avocado egg rolls are also delicious, never get old.  3. The fried mac and cheese balls are a lot of peoples favorite, but they are a little to heavy and fried for me, still really good though.  4. The sweet corn tamale cakes are really good.  Underrated appetizers -buffalo blasts.  lighter appetizers -spring roles( good if you want something healthier -Roasted Artichoke (delicious balsamic dip) The sliders are pretty average I wouldn't opt for them, but good for kids.  Best Courses by category:  Top Pasta dishes  - Pasta Da Vinci (always good, but definitely need to ask for extra sauce on the side) - Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (good but spicy) - Four Cheese pasta with chicken (everyone's go to, simple but good) -Shrimp with angel hair is also simple but delicious.  Top Chicken Dishes  -Crusted Chicken Romano (substitute penne pasta and ask for extra sauce, way better) -Bang bang chicken and shrimp (if you like Thai) -Chicken madeira( Straight up AMAZING EVERY TIME) HIGHLY RECOMMEND -Chicken Picatta (NEEDS EXTRA SAUCE) -Spicy Cashew chicken(but wish it came with veggies) -The Factory burrito Grande (HUGEEEEE. For sharing. Grande is not a joke) Top Seafood  All the salmon options are fantastic but my opinion of the best flavors in order are      1. Miso      2. Thai       3. Barbeque      4. Grilled      5. Herb Crusted  -Jamaican black pepper shrimp is great too (served with plantains)  Top Steak dishes  -Hibachi steak is delicious (I order a side of mac and cheese in substitue of the mashed potatoes) -The steak Diane and the steak Diane medallions are so tender -most of the steaks are made really well  Burgers -Old fashioned burger (can't go wrong) -wild mushroom burger -blue cheese burger -Mac and Cheese burger (if you want something super heavy) -Veggie (just ok, wouldn't recommend over other dishes) Sandwiches -Grilled Chicken And Avocado Club (ask for ranch on the side, I ask for no mayo) -Chicken Parmesan Sandwich -California Cheesesteak Salads -Vegan cobb salad (healthy and delicious) -Bbq chicken salad (delicious, not very healthy though) Most of the salads actually aren't that healthy but they are good falafel salad (pretty bad, probably biased because I'm middle eastern so I know how good falafel should taste Desserts Dulce De leche caramel   Godiva  Red velvet (not sure if it's still on the menu)  Strawberry shortcake (ask for extra ice cream) No matter how sick of Cheesecake Factory I am it will always have a special place in my heart. We've come here for birthdays, graduations, anniversary's, and so many other important events in our life. It will always feel like home. No normal family should eat at one restaurant this much",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=140

Jo K.,"Orange County, CA",481,101,196,3.0,2/26/2016,"Huge plus! They got rid of advertising every other page on their menu!! If it weren't for the service, I might have gone to maybe 2 stars... When we were waiting to be seated, I glanced over at one of chefs sticking their hand in one of the prep stations and eating, while cooking food for the guests. That is not sanitary by any means... Service: - Again, exceptional service. He was friendly and professional throughout the entire night.  Food: Fish Taco Plate - This was surprisingly quite tasty. Four crispy fish tacos with a different flavor profile. I liked how they put the fish on top of the taco so it doesn't get soggy from the veggies. Unfortunately, the beans and the rice were definitely not something I would order again. Overall: I am sure everyone has had Cheesecake Factory at some point in their lives.

They refused to reserve a table for us of 23 people until we all showed up so we had to wait a half hour just to be seated. Then after we were seated it took longer than reasonable for us to be taken care of, drinks, appetizers entrees all took forever. Since my new husband and I were busy talking to our guests we asked to have our order placed at the end of the night for To Go, we ended up waiting well after our guests had left for our dinner to be finished which was cold when we got it and we also told the server we would be paying for everyone's desserts and that also got screwed up.

We asked for an empty plastic cup for the kid but that didn't come through. The kids pasta order came without the chicken that we asked for, he took it to the kitchen, came back 2 mins later telling us they're out of chicken and asked whether we still want it or he'll just take it back without asking if we want anything else for the kid to eat.  We asked for tissue, and when he got it, it fell out of his hands on a plate of fries, he basically said oops sorry, turned around and left immediately without even getting new clean ones!

Cindy S.,"Irvine, CA",263,314,613,3.0,8/5/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is well known for its novel of a menu.  It takes hours to get through and everything ordered on the menu is pretty average.  It's no surprise that if you are serving a wide array of offerings, it's hard to perfect a particular genre. I'd say nothing is terribly bad except for their lettuce wraps.  My suggestion is not to get asian food at a nonasian restaurant and you should be safe. Anyhoo, came here for national cheesecake day.  I remember having cheesecake at the factory and loving every bite of it.  As it turns out cheesecake has its own day just as mothers do but cheesecake extends for 2 days.  I'm not complaining for half-off cheesecake for two days.  I was ecstatic.  I usually stick to my 2 favorites: classic (sometimes with strawberry topping) or the pumpkin when it's in season.  They are to die for.  This go round I tried another popular flavor as recommended by a server there and I was sorely disappointed.  Had the white chocolate mac nut cheesecake.   The cheesecake part of the dessert was spot on but the nuts baked into it were old and stale tasting.  The topping had fresh nuts which was better but the old nuts ruined the overall flavor.  On top of that the whipped cream machine was broken so that couldn't mask the old nut flavor.  I will be back for national cheesecake day next year and maybe another visit in between.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=140

Then there are the undercooked poached eggs.  Yes, you want your yolk runny, but you don't want the white runny. Yes, they were running, not soft, running.

Kristin Leigh M.,"Las Flores, CA",701,1127,1789,4.0,1/10/2015,"Wear comfy shoes! Why? You'll likely be waiting for a very long time, if you come for supper, and there isn't ample space to sit. So you will be standing. Dinner waits are usually more than 30 minutes, and can be over 50 minutes on on the weekends. I personally don't have that type of patience as a party of two, so I've started to visit the Shops at Mission Viejo location more, where wait times are more reasonable. If you come for lunch during the week, you might not have to wait. On the weekends, could be around 15 minutes.  A few pointers: + tropical iced tea is delicious + I could live off of the bread baskets. And I'm not joking. If you dine with me, we will have at least two. (yes, I have an addiction to bread). + crusted chicken romano is the best dish. Lunch portion is plenty large, and I always have leftovers. + if you get the asian chicken salad, get it without the ""straws."" can't recall their exact name, but the white noodle things that come on top. look lovely but make eating the salad near impossible and are a huge filler. + if you don't like a TON of salad dressing, order it on the side. + service is always impeccable.  + indoor and outdoor (with heaters) seating available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=140

Margaret L.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",1,76,,3.0,11/2/2016,The Cheesecake selection is delicious as this is what your restaurant and the name are known for. We tried both the white chocolate caramel and the chocolate chip.   My constructive criticism (I hope) to note is when entering your restaurant the wait for a hostess to seat the customer is not efficient. There were numerous open tables and it still took 10 minutes to be seated way in the back and the dark.The front staff staff chatted while deciding which table and where and then it took 2 people to escort a part of 2! Our server was very good and pleasant. I do think you could cut down on the huge scoops of whipped cream placed on the cake. Turned me off a little before I even tasted it. Maybe most diners like all the whipped cream but it takes away from the special cheesecake flavors.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=180
Michael Y.,"North Hollywood, CA",72,2,1,4.0,10/30/2016,"After a 2-hour workout, my friends and I decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory at Irvine Spectrum Center on Friday night to get some fat. As a bodybuilder you need to get extra calories after your training in order to make up part of your expending. It was 9pm and there were not so many diners. There are several parking lots, so feel free to drive! It has nice location, nice service, nice environment, fine tastes and reasonable price. It's a fine place to relieve your hunger. You will enjoy the appetizer. They offer two kinds of breads. The first one is traditional baguette. It's as hard as the dumbbell so you may want to cut it into little pieces. The second one is chocolate flavor baguette. This one is smooth enough like a yoga mat. REMEMBER THIS! Do not finish the bread before your 20 dollars main course comes. I don't think your stomach can hold all of them. The food I ordered is ""Shrimp with Angel Hair"". As you can tell, I chose this because of the name. What the heck is Angel Hair, right?  After it arrived, I saw my Angel Hair. It has beige coat and it does look like hairs. It tastes like real hairs too! Well, that's not true. It's just pasta, thinner pasta. The food serving is ok, enough for a hungry bodybuilder. One of my friends got a XXL one! I would say the serving is just right, no extra and no surplus. This meal cost us $100 total ($25 each) which is acceptable for a bodybuilder. Steaks and lettuce are much more expansive, aren't they! My hairs tasted bad at the beginning. Actually it had no taste at all. :( So we asked for more cheese. The situation turned better with the extra cheese. There were 6 large fresh shrimps huddled up around the plate and a heap of hairs winded in the middle. Grilled tomato pieces are dotted on the top. The whole thing is surrounded by Marinara Sauce. Overall my hair tastes ok, looks good and my friends said theirs are fine too. ;) Servers there are absolutely kind and patient. When I was here the first time, I was not sure about what the dishes are. Our waitress explained everything perfectly clear for us. My bio97 professor did the same thing during lecture! LOL One big disadvantage of The Cheesecake Factory is that it takes forever to make your food. I mean, how much time can making pasta takes? You may have to finish all bread and butter and a cup of drink before getting your main course but AGAIN, DON'T DO IT. You can hear the sound of metal banging on metal if you are seated next to the kitchen but don't panic! It's not an earthquake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=180

Instead of being offered a refill on my iced tea I had to request it. She took my cup and brought it back full but with no ice. Oh, thanks. I love room temperature tea while seated outside on a hot patio.  Last but not least we were brought the bill very abruptly without being asked if we would like anything else. What else could we want? Oh, I don't know... Maybe CHEESECAKE?!  Needless to say we didn't partake in dessert due to the poor service and chose to get out of there as soon as we could, came home, and had dessert.  Unfortunate experience on such a special day.

There are plenty of servers and employees, but they don't care to check on me or other customers near me. (waited 8 min for a straw) I keep calm because Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant.

Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,11/5/2015,"I had spent over 5 hours straight in Dave and Buster's playing one arcade game. No water break and no food break. At 5 pm, I was hungry, dehydrated, and tired. Walking around the Spectrum in search of food, I ended up towards the other end from D & B's at the Cheesecake Factory. Very minimal wait for a table of 2 (less than 10 minutes), despite coming in on a Sunday. First order of business was sodas all around to replenish the low blood sugar from the unexpecting fasting during arcade game play. The first glass of Coke was very refreshing. After getting some sugar in, it was easier to think about what to order. Round one was the spinach and cheese dip appetizer ($11.95), which came with tortilla chips and salsa. I was pleased it came hot to our table, the temperature just right for the cheesy spinach and artichoke gooeyness to be scooped up by the chips. Seared tuna tataki salad ($18.50). This is my usual go-to salad at the Cheesecake Factory and BJ's and any other chain restaurants if they have such a salad on the menu. I asked for dressing on the side, but the dish came with dressing mixed into the salad + an additional container of dressing on the side. -_- That sort of defeated the purpose of me asking. Other than more dressing than I requested and wanted (the salad was drenched in the usual amounts as a salad with dressing mixed in would be), the seared tuna's quality and freshness matched the price and the avocado slices were just the right amount of ripe. Louisiana chicken pasta ($16.95). BF opted for the full dinner size portion (lunch size is also available). I took a couple of bites and while good, it lacked a certain umph. On a scale of 1 - 5 with 5 as the top, I'd rate it a 3.  Overall, this place is what you'd expect of a Cheesecake Factory.

Robert H.,"Irvine, CA",0,17,3,2.0,7/23/2015,"Overall 2 star experience due to the last rating which ruined the night for me. Food - 4 stars.  They have great variety here, everyone in our party always loves the brown bread and butter and the entrees are never bad, some better than others.  My wife had a grilled chicken sandwich and I had Renee's special.  Cream of Chicken soup was great but both our salads were either not dressed or too light to tell.  Overall no major complaints. Service - 2 stars.  Couldn't figure out who our waitress was, I think they changed on us twice as someone either had to go on break or was leaving for the night.  Never knew who to flag down for a soda refill so ended up embarrassing myself asking another waitress who gave me a half eyeroll when she said she would let my server know. Facilities - 0 stars.  Please see below for my picture of the men's restroom on a Sunday night at 10:30pm.  The restaurant was nearly empty and the restrooms hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long.  This is the worst part about this place.  When either kid says they have to go to the restroom, I dread it as the men's restrooms here are always filthy.  I closed my eyes going in and hoped for the best, but this is what I got. Saying goes, you can usually tell how clean the kitchen is by judging the restroom cleanliness.  I certainly hope this isn't the case as we'll probably be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=220

Chelsea M.,"Fullerton, CA",628,573,156,4.0,4/6/2015,"Hibachi Steak is certified Angus beef hanger steak with shiitake mushrooms, onions, and bean sprouts served with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. The steak was a great cut, but I think it would have been better served as whole with the shiitake, onion, and bean sprout mixture on top. The sauce that everything was tossed in was overpowering whole plate. It would have been better as a marinade for the steak and let it caramelize on the grill. The wasabi mashed potatoes did not quite match. This would have paired better with fish like miso-glazed salmon. The tempura asparagus were cooked perfectly with a crispy, light batter while retaining the green flavor of the asparagus. Rating: 2/5 Grilled Rib-Eye Steak is served with French fries. I think a couple of tempura onion rings snuck onto my plate as well. The ribeye was grilled to a perfect rare. The meat was beautifully marbled for a juicy, tender steak. The fries were fried perfectly with a golden brown crispy outside and tender on the inside. The tempura onion rings were fantastic! The batter was light and crispy on the outside and the onion was sweet and tender inside. Rating: 5/5 Kobe Burger is an American style Kobe beef burger topped with sautéed mushrooms and onions. I can't eat a burger without cheese so I added a slice of cheddar. One of my friends had ordered it on a prior visit and she loved it. I love Wagyu beef so I knew the next time, I had to try it. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, blending the grilled flavor on the outside and taste the sweet, buttery flavor of the meat inside. This burger was onolicious! It's one of the best burgers I've ever had. The mushrooms and onions were the perfect topping. I am glad that I went with a green salad instead of fries. This was a burger to finish in one sitting. Reheating it would not do it justice. Rating: 5/5 Chicken Madeira is sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus, melted mozzarella, mushroom Madeira sauce, and served with mashed potatoes. This is my hubby's favorite dish of all time! He has been ordering it since we started dating back in the early 1990s. The flavor is always consistent and he always orders it for dinner. The chicken was tender and soaked up the addictive Madeira sauce. The mushrooms acted like sponges and absorbed the sauce as well. The mashed potatoes were creamy and had just enough lumpy texture of potato and red potato skin. Rating: 5/5 Cappuccino is double espresso and foamy steamed milk. I'm not sure what kind of beans that they use or if I'm just used to coffee in Europe, but the espresso used was very bitter and acidic. Even with sugar, the bitter bite just hits you like a freight train. Rating: 2/5 Chocolate Chip Cookie-Dough Cheesecake is creamy cheesecake loaded with chocolate chip cookie-dough and walnuts. The cheesecake was creamy and silky. The cookie-dough added a granular sugar texture and flavor. The chocolate chips can be hard as they were in the refrigerator but melt down pretty quickly on the palate. I also loved the whipped cream dollops sprinkled with even more chocolate chips. Rating: 5/5 Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple is creamy cheesecake swirled with caramel, peanut butter, Butterfinger and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. This is also my hubby's favorite cheesecake. He orders this cheesecake probably 90% of the time. It has all of his favorite flavors in it: chocolate, caramel, and peanut butter. It was very rich and decadent. He will usually take it home and will take two to three sittings to finish it. It goes great with a hot cup of coffee. Rating: 5/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=220

We got two tap beers, fried calamari as an appetizer, and a couple of sandwiches, and spend a little over $50 with tip. Our server was polite, knowledgeable, and attentive to our needs...we didn't find many like this in most of our servers. The only minor complaint was the seating arrangement is cramped, but we came after supper rush, so it didn't take long for tables to empty out, so we had a bit more room.

After 1 hour wait, the waiter brought the steak dish and it was literally nothing, but pieces of burned meat!! You couldn't even chew it! The other dish tasted nasty even though we asked for a simple chicken breast dish with a side of orange sauce!! we explained to the manager that the chickens seemed to be frozen and had no salt/pepper!! The manager gave us attitude and didn't do anything about it!

Terry, our wonderful server, immediately asked what brought us in, and kindly congratulated my son, and made him feel like he was beyond special.

That kid looked like he'd been crowned the king!!! Eating his wontons and drinking a milkshake he said ""mom, Terry is the best waitress I've ever had""!!!! Insane!!

The presentation was good as always but my 2 year old who we ordered chicken fingers for received more chicken on his plate then ALL 3 of us put together.  $48.00 for 3 heads of lettuce, REALLY? We complained to the waitress that there really was no chicken in any of the salads and she came back with... ""Each salad has 6oz of chicken in it.""  We told her there must of been a mistake and that there was NO WAY ours did. We aren't ones to complain on site and it was either me calling her a liar or us calling us liars. Never got the manager and didn't offer anything in return for out dissatisfaction for the service. We paid and left it alone but will never be back to this particular Cheesecake Factory again. So if you do go and you do order this salad... ask for the chicken on the side so you know you're not paying $15.00 for $0.59 head of lettuce. I'm in the food industry and this was handled terribly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=740
DOUGLAS K.,"Tustin, CA",0,31,4,2.0,4/4/2015,"Just experienced very bad service from the hostess to bus boy to waiter to expediter. Problem is Manager is too busy with Administrative duties instead of training and overseeing his Staff. A bunch of college students who just go through the motions and mingle at the resister and talk. First,  Hostess wants to put us in a booth that is literally, no kidding, three feet from the bath room door. Really? And, nice restaurant design. Are you kidding me? Next Waiter acts like he is close to his shift end so we hurry up and order at 3pm. Next, we politely ask the Expediter for some more sauce for the avocado rolls (since they only give you about two teaspoons) and she does not say a word and just nods. I thank her when she brings it back and, again, she does not say a word. Made me feel like my request, and her job, was an inconvenience to her. Next, we ask the Waiter for some bread. He says he has to wait until it comes out of the oven. Really? Sat afternoon and the Manager is not assuring the cooks to have enough bread ?? Next, as we are eating and finishing our meals, the Waiter comes by twice, the bus boys walk by twice empty handed until we finally have to wave down our waiter and ask him to remove the empty plates and glasses. He does get a bus tray, instead he tries to stack as many as possible and in the process spills sauce and crumbs all over the table. Do you think he comes back with a towel to wipe it up? Nope, he just comes back and gives us the bill and places the bill folder right in sauce. I ask him to please just bring me a towel and I'll clean it up for him. Worst service I have ever experienced. You get better service at McDonalds or Taco Bell. Three people and a bill for $138 with this bad of service?

Brandon N.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",7,22,1,4.0,2/27/2012,"Okay, I've heard some people talk about cheesecake factory complaining how it's expensive, and really, if you're going to come to a place like this, you shouldn't expect to be spending only five dollars. You get what you pay for, and for the price, you get some pretty nice quality food here.  Onto the food. I've been here with my girlfriend, and we get the Firecracker Salmon appetizer, which is pretty gosh darn good. I usually skimp on appetizers because I feel like, for the price, it's not worth it. (10 dollars an appetizer, 13 an entree, might as well get the entree right?) but this was a pretty nice exception. It was pretty great! Although the measly four pieces left much to be desired, and I craved more. The bread that they give as an appetizer is also pretty great. I love their honey wheat bread, with a light bit of butter in between, and even though I normally hate sourdough, it was pretty good here too.  As far as entree's are concerned, we ordered two entrees, the salmon filet and the jambalaya. We tried sharing to finish but frankly, two entrees is a HUGE amount of food. (Part of why you should expect that you're paying a lot). So we had planned to get cheesecake too, but honestly, we just had no room.  The cheesecake here is phenomenal though. I've tried the classic, the strawberry, the kahlua, and the red velvet. All of which are smooth and creamy and sweet. The perfect little dessert to cap off a great dinner. All in all, this place would make a great little lunch place or a fantastic dinner restaurant.

Otherwise, the set up is about the same as any other CF, the food is typical and the location is obviously convenient. The cheesecakes/desserts are always fresh and the appetizers tend to be better than the actual entrees...not sure why, but thats been my experience.  On my last note...The Red velvet Cheesecake...TO DIE FOR!

We arrived at about 7PM and we sat down at about 7:45, the wait wasn't the problem but the method in which they decide to seat people.  OK, you walk in they give you a pager, that's all good; after your pager buzzes you think that you are about to be seated, think again then you are moved into the bar area where a server appears about 15 min. later yelling out your name searching for you in a room, not only packed with waiting customers but people at the bar already eating. This was complete confusion and chaos. Why not just buzz your pager and seat you!  We decide to sit at a table at the bar instead of being seated outside in the cold. The table still had cups and shot glasses from the previous customers, but we didn't care we were hungry. The cups and shot glasses were never cleared from our table and our server was obviously so flustered she barely got our orders right. We could see that by the expression on her face she couldn't wait for the night to be over, by this point we were feeling the same way.  Now the food... I ordered the cheeseburger, the meat was gross and chewy and the burger was cold as well. The only thing good was my banana cream cheesecake is was delish.

Nicole D.,"Framingham, MA",13,64,131,2.0,2/9/2014,"I'm so saddened to have to update my review because it means my opinion since my first review has changed. My husband and I decided to grab lunch here today as we normally do on the weekends. Today wasn't overly crowded considering it was a weekend. However the service was considerably slow and our waitress was incredibly overwhelmed. She was very kind but my husband and I, along with the neighboring tables who she was responsible for, felt forgotten.  We placed our orders. I ordered the soup of the day as my appetizer and we each ordered entrees. The bread came out and my soup didn't. We waited for my soup for about 10 minutes and it eventually came about 2 minutes before our entrees ( so the table space was limited).  My plate was hot but the food on it was like warm... That didn't make sense.  I should also note that we were seated before a neighboring party of 4 and they all got their appetizers and entrees before my soup even came out.  My husband ordered a spicy buffalo chicken sandwich and asked for a side of blue cheese crumbles. It came out with blue cheese dressing,which was no big deal. We simply asked the food runner for the crumbles and that came our right away. Our server checked on us and we asked for more buffalo sauce since there was only a dash on the sandwich. It took about 10 minutes to get that ( and we had to remind her). So by the time my husband could enjoy his meal it was cold. That was disappointing.  We wanted dessert but there was no way I was going to sit around and wait for that. I just witnessed the party of 4 next to us wait about 15 minutes for their dessert. So we asked for the check which took another 10 minutes. We paid the bill and walked up to the to go counter and got our dessert in less than 3 minutes.  I felt our waitress was incredibly overwhelmed. I really feel like we spent the entire time just waiting. It took away from our dining experience. So I guess we will see what happens the next time we decide to eat there. I should also note that normally we sit along the wall with the windows that face the valet parking. Today we dined in the room over where the bar is. I wonder if the window tables just get better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=500

Haihey S.,"Irvine, CA",92,172,31,3.0,9/7/2013,"I typically like coming to The Cheesecake Factory, because the menu is vast, and the food is pretty consistent no matter where you go.  Obviously, I would give the cheesecake 5/5 for breadth of selection and consistent quality. The service is typically quite good across the board.  Also, 5/5 stars for having their ""Skinnylicious"" menu offerings. It is a separate menu altogether that has about 50 different menu items all under approx. 600 calories. The walnut and pear salad is very good from the Skinnylicious menu.  However, the reason I am giving only 3 stars is that they recently CHANGED their normal menu, and I believe the quality has decreased as a result.  My husband enjoys their nachos, however when he ordered them today, instead of the regular melted cheese on top, it came with what looked like cheese whiz all over the top. We asked the waiter what had changed and he went back to the kitchen and came back to us and said instead of melted cheese, they now put ""cheese sauce"" on top.

I met my waitress Melanie.  She was very nice and accommodating.    As many people know, the menu here has alot of things to try, but today I was going to keep it simple and order spaghetti and meatballs.  Melanie comes back to inform me that they were *out of meatballs.  ok then....I told her I was interested in the rib eye steak.  *Denied!  They were out.  I then ordered something much less interesting: a burger.  Like many restaurants it appears the burger was cooked at a little too high a temperature resulting in a little surface charring.  Regardless, the charring was not too much to overlook.  Overall, I would give the burger an 8.  It was actually a good burger.  Partly into the meal, the manager...Anh?  can out and he told me the burger was on him.  Nice.  That was the proper thing to do in that situation.  As a customer, I appreciate the gesture to make up for what happened earlier.   Overall, Melanie was a very good server.  She was very friendly, and accommodating.  The manager passed my test, and performed great customer service by doing the right thing, and making it up to me.   This review I give them a 4 star.  If there were no hitches, I would not have had a problem giving them a 5 star.

Most of the food entrees I've eaten over the years here have been fine.  There's just nothing special in the flavor department to really highlight.  I do like my Pasta Da Vinci though.  It's just okay food blown to semi-ridiculous portions.  By the time the topic of dessert comes around, you have to ask the server, ""Are you JOKING?""  Yet, the thought of eating that soft yummy goodness called cheesecake only CF knows how to make, in dozens of flavors and varieties...oh man...

Server Megan took forever to greet our table, when she finally came over we just ordered water. Brought our water about 5 minutes later and took our order, salmon for my friend and basil pasta for me. We also asked for straws.  15 minutes later, our food arrived(still didn't get straws) we ask the food runner for some and he brings them right away. My pasta was hard and undercooked. Had to flag down our server, who only had 4 tables. She wasn't sure what I wanted, told her I wanted my pasta refired, she gave me some attitude and took it back. New pasta finally comes out and it was cooked better but there is no chicken. Again had to flag her down and she thought I was lying when I said I have no chicken and took my pasta to check herself. I asked her for a side of chicken finally came out and the chicken was robbery and tasted like it was in the microwave. By this time we just want to leave, we had enough of her attitude and snarky remarks. We asked for our check and a manager who we never got, guessing she never went to tell one a table wanted to speak with them. When we are walking out I stopped to manager and told him what had happened he was apologetic but that was it.

Lauren C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",25,15,,1.0,12/4/2010,"My husband and I frequently enjoy lunch at The Yard House in the Irvine Spectrum.  Today, we ventured there as usual only to find they weren't open until 1:00 because they were hosting a special event....much to our dismay.  After hearing the news, we decided to settle on The Cheescake Factory.  There was quite a long wait for a table but there were several bar tables open, so we grabbed one. Once we sat down, it took approx 10 minutes for someone, who I assumed was our waitress (waitress #1) to ask if we'd like something to drink.  My husband ordered an iced tea to which the waitress replied, ""Passionfruit""?  My husband responded, ""Regular Tea, please""....only to have her walk off without acknowledging his reply.  It took approximately another ten minutes for someone else (waitress #2) to bring us our drinks only to find out that it was indeed a passionfruit tea instead of a regular.  Waitress #2 took the drink back and minutes later brought back a regular tea.   Once we finally had our drinks, it took approximately another 10-15 minutes to have the bartender (waitress #3) stop by and take our food order.  I don't typically like to place my entree order at the same time as my appetizer order, but figured I may as well get while the gettin's good!  My husband and I ordered spinach dip (blaahhhhh...i think it was low sodium or something b/c it was terrible!) and split the Chicken Avocado Club with fries. We waited for about another 20 minutes before a young man (waiter #4) to bring our spinach dip who was kind enough to refill our drinks for us as they had been empty since waitress #3 took our order. Our sandwich followed about 15 minutes after the delivery of the spinach dip only to be delivered by waitress #5.  When she dropped the sandwich off, we had to ask her to clear our empty plates so we could fit the sandwich plate b/c she simply wanted to shove it in amongst the other dirty dishes.  Once she took the dirty plates, I asked her if we could have an extra plate because we were splitting the sandwich.  (btw, the sandwich was the only redeeming factor in the entire debacle...it was fairly tasty)  We waited on the extra plate about 5 minutes before figuring out it wasn't coming at all, so we hovered over the same plate.  The side dish that accompanied the sandwich was french fries for which we were brought no ketchup.  However, I managed to snag waitress #1's attention and asked for a bottle. Our drinks have now been empty since half way through our meal.  10 minutes goes by before waitress #3 walks by and asks if we want cheesecake.  We reply that we're full and before having a chance to request the check, she disappears as quickly as she came from behind the bar.  Another ten minutes goes by and still no check.  Absolutely fed up at this point, my husband makes the call that we'll add up what our food and drink purchases were plus tax and leave the cash......which is exactly what we did.  We never received our check and even though we left cash (no tip, just for the food) I still felt like we did a dine and dash b/c we NEVER received the check. During our visit, I observed two tables in the same vicinity get up and walk out because they hadn't been served.  We even witnessed a woman who seemed to be 8 or 9 months pregnant sit at the bar to have lunch.  She was there for at least 20 minutes, waiting much more patiently that I would have, to order her iced tea and a sandwich.   This was the hands down worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  I cannot speak for the dining room service, but do not go to this bar and expect to be treated like anything but a bother to the staff.  The manager was even going to a few of the tables and asking how everything was.  He took a look at me and could tell I was super pissed and looked down like a dog with a tail between his legs and walked away.  I guess he only wants feedback if he knows it's good.  I will never step foot in another Cheesecake Factory again.

Sean S.,"San Jose, CA",5,17,,1.0,11/30/2009,"My wife and I decided to go to this restaurant because we knew we would get a huge portion that the two of us could split.  Our experience was that we were told it was a 20 minute wait. 45 minutes later we were told to go wait near the bar. 10 minutes after standing around our waitress took us to our table which was right next to where apparently the bus boys like to put silverware into napkins and bullshit about how hot or not waitress are... Awesome. So we ordered a pasta dish to split, and some avacado rolls as an appetizer... 20 minutes later having not seen our waitress we get our main dish. The waitress then comes by to reassure us that her main goal is to ""make sure that our experience is a happy experience"" and apologizes for either not ordering the appetizer or just not picking it up.  After we finished our meal the waitress was still trying to upsell us on after dinner liquors and coffees, and I couldn't believe the nerve of the woman.

Honestly you guys are in the dark ages with regard to your plant based menu and choices and could be appealing to a huge growing population of plant based and vegan eaters.  As a mom, if Cheesecake Factory comes up as an option, like many other mainstream ""blah"" restaurant chains, I adamantly protest and usually get my way.  I am hoping you will read this review and take it into consideration and instead of ignoring us, add a ""plant based"" menu for ""us"" who are quickly growing in number.  Your chain should be offering the BEST vegan cheesecake and leading the way....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=480

Will M.,"Santa Ana, CA",554,646,2473,4.0,10/18/2009,"Overall a nice Sunday lunch again.  We had a different waitress than last time. Though Janelle W. was new, she definitely knew the menu. I played dumb, not hard for me, and she knew exactly how they  prepared each dish, a welcome relief from some places where they hire them without knowing anything about their menu. She also was not shy telling us her favorite things on the menu, and why she'd recommend them. About the Caesar salad she asked if you liked the authentic version with anchovy paste in the dressing, otherwise the more typical green salad might be better with your choice of dressing.  She was very friendly, food arrived promptly, food was as good as usual, and few minor complaints.   The warm bread came out with the too-hard butter. Someone forgot to set our table with bread plates, so when the bread arrived, we had to wait for plates.  The host also didn't bring the special value friendly menu that had specials like caramel chicken. I had to ask if that was still available, and the waitress grabbed the proper menu.   So caramel chicken ($13) is what I ordered. It's like orange chicken with a tinge of caramel in the orange sauce with an overall sweet-sour-salty-taste with a little kick.  They put carrots, crispy green beans, mushrooms togeher atop crispy fried chicken breast.  Overall very good especially when it first arrives, and the sauce hasn't made the breading limp. Like some of the people you may have dated, it's  something to enjoy now but not take home, and it's served with rice. The other orders on our table were cheese quesadilla ($8) appetizer and the sausage pizza lunch ($12) that came with the small bowl of caesar or green salad.  The soft drink prices have climbed to $3.00 now, but I had the 16 oz Hefeweizen on tap ($6). They kept the soft drink glasses filled.  It's a family friendly place so they did have the usual crying kids. Also, I'm not usually into the interior of places too much, but today, I just happened to notice how nice the walls and ceiling and overall style of this place is.  It was a very good lunch overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=480

We got seated right away by the bar area. When we got seated, I got up to use the restroom and told my boyfriend to order for me. When I got back, he said our server didn't come by yet. I thought that was strange cause usually they come by right when you get seated. Get this, we waited 10 minutes until a nice female server came up to us, shocked, that nobody came around to help us. I was beyond annoyed but she was so nice and apologized and told us that our server, Victor, would be helping us. She took our order and drinks and told us she'll get Victor to help us out now. We waited and this male server came to our table and dropped bread off and said ""We don't have anymore wheat bread so I gave you whatever we have left"" and then he just left. Wtf...No introduction, nothing. I saw that he was waiting the 4 tables in front of us and behind us but not ONCE did he stop by our table after that. I'm not sure if he was supposed to be our server but it felt like he was purposely avoiding us. At one point, my boyfriend and I thought he was racist and refused to wait our table. The nice female server dropped off our food and still no word on Victor. When we were done, we grabbed her and told her what we encountered with the male server and that Victor never once stopped by our table.

Granted we knew exactly what we were going to order and was done in 30 minutes.  Our server was very patient with us and reassured us that we were no trouble, even though it seemed like she was one of the last servers there. You already know we tipped her well!  I always order the chicken madeira and steak Diane combo, and a mango freeze. I'm never let down at any and every Cheesecake Factory that I go to. The sauces for the madeira and steak are phenomenal and go extremely well together. And the mango freeze is so refreshing.  I usually come to the Irvine Spectrum Cheesecake Factory for happy hour, which is also one of the best happy hours EVER. The bartenders are always so nice, $6 cocktails, and great food selection!

Lauren V.,"Austin, TX",200,123,34,2.0,4/1/2017,"I went here the other day with a few friends.  2 of them had to leave by 1pm and let the waitress know.  We sat down by 12 and we put our order in around 12:15 and didn't get food for a good half hour while other tables that ordered later/came later were getting food.  When they brought the food, they brought one of the entrees out at least 5 minutes before anyone else (she ordered the crusted chicken romano and someone else at the table ordered exactly that as well so there is no excuse).  I ordered a salad and added grilled chicken.  The food was fine once it actually came, no complaints there.   The waitress really could have cared less about the inconvenience of my friends not being able to actually eat their meals there, they had a few bites and took it with them to go.  My one friend asked to speak to the manager because she had noted specifically at the beginning that 2 of the people were on a time crunch and was upset our food seemed to come out as less of a priority than other tables. The manager was nice and took off the appetizer (which only the other 2 people ordered so it didn't benefit me in any way really).  She offered dessert but we declined.   When the bill came the waitress had forgotten to put on my coffee and made a point to come back with a new check for the 3.50 coffee which seemed petty considering the circumstance of a ruined lunch in which we didn't get to eat with our friends. After our 2 friends left I had some more coffee and the 2 of us left ended up ordering a piece of cheesecake to share.  Not that I wanted it for free but don't offer something and then not follow through.  On top of that the waitress stopped by every 3 minutes to ""check on us"" because I think she wanted us to leave.  I had come here 1 time previously and would rate that visit 3 stars.  On that visit we had to ask twice for a baby sling (to put the carrier in) before someone went and got it.  The service on that visit was otherwise okay but not spectacular. So I totaled it to 2 stars for an average. I won't be coming back to this location, I have frequented the one in Fashion Island and prefer that location, there are plenty of other places to eat at the Spectrum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=40
Alice W.,"Irvine, CA",296,219,258,4.0,11/24/2016,"For this specific location, the service is always nice, but there is always quite a long wait. But, that just means more friend bonding time. Food portions are quite large and the cheescakes are the same as any other cheesecake factory. Some of my favorite foods: - Thai Lettuce Wraps: 5/5 - Get ready to delve into your food. Making the lettuce wraps is always fun and the presentation of the plate is gorgeous. Add your grilled chicken into any of the lettuce wraps, drizzle on your favorite (or all) of the sauces, add the beansprouts, carrots, etc, and then consume. Not too heavy at all. - Chicken Madeira: 5/5 Tender chicken atop fluffy mashed potatoes and decorated with skinny asparagus. The dish is on the heavier side and will get you full quickly. Lots of flavor and texture going on, which I love. - Fave cheesecake: Banana Creme Cheesecake: 5/5 - If you are a fan of banana creme, try the banana cream cheesecake. Although I wish there was more than just the layer of banana cream on top of the cheesecake, it is still so good, and I recommend it! I usually only go here when we have larger parties so the wait is always long, but I continue to dine at Cheesecake Factory since it is nice and has something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=40

This was unacceptable considering I saw party of 4, party of 5 and party of 8 just strolling by before us. We were really patient and understanding but someone dropped the ball. We could have easily been seated outside or in another area. It didn't seem like they cared! And although they tried by comping the appetizers, it took the kitchen nearly 40 min to bring the food. They could have been honest when I spoke to the first 2 managers and told us that they couldn't seat us or that they were too busy to serve us.

One thing I hate is the parking situation! I would hate to be around here during busy peak times! Even though I came on a Sunday we came late around 9PM so it was a breeze but still! My sister had to drop me and mom off at the curb to cross the street to get to the restaurant while she was circling for parking since we only saw Valet across from the restaurant we had KL with us and had to self park. By the time our name was called my sister walked in right on time, the wait was no more than 10 minutes which was excellent! We even got a booth instead of those half table/booth those are the worst! Our waitress came around to us in a timely manner, we didn't feel like she didn't know we were there which is a pet peeve of us when we go out! Even though she still had a good amount of tables she always checked on us and was attentive!  We mainly ordered appetizers so we could share without ordering a ton of food. We ordered: -Crispy crab bites -Chicken Potstickers -Sliders with fries -Custom pizza I loved our appetizers minus the seafood one (I didn't try it since I don't like seafood) my mom did note that our Potstickers could have been hotter which I agree, they were lukewarm :/ My sliders came on these perfectly buttered buns! The presentation was so cute! I filled up on bread and potstickers so I took the other half home. I haven't tried my sisters pizza yet but she said the pizza was lame :/ Hardly no sauce and was lacking that ""ooey gooey"" pizza feel. She gave her leftovers to me and I'm sure I can spruce it up a bit with more sauce!  They brought me out a free Sundae and sang HBD to me which was nice! Overall the whole dining experience was great! I can't even imagine what it's like during rush hour time since there was still a good amount of people around the time we were there! I'm content, but if I was really craving Cheesecake Factory again I'd probably just go to the Bella Terra location since it's much easier to navigate! ^___^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=40

I can't seem to find anyone who hates it here. This review will focus only on their happy hour, which is Monday thru Friday from 4-6. We arrived at 5:30, expecting it to be packed on a Thursday afternoon, but found the bar area relatively empty, with only a few tables taken. Our server was there in seconds, offering water, and took our drink orders.  We ordered their specialty martini drinks on the happy hour menu for $5.50. They were delicious, and large. Before the drinks even arrived, she brought out a bread basket with butter, and it was warm and very tasty.  We placed our order for food, and chose the happy hour burger, the Vietnamese spring rolls, and the fried mix of avocado, zucchini, and mushroom.  The food arrived at our table surprisingly fast, about 5-7 minutes. Burger: Two patties, two slices of cheese, and a big brioche bun. A tasty burger for five bucks. Not the best, but top notch for a happy hour item. Fried stuff: Loved the dipping sauces, the mushrooms, and the zucchini, but wasn't into the fried avocado. Just weird on flavor and texture.  Spring rolls: I loved these, and the two dipping sauces. One was oily and spicy, the other peanut based. Both were good. I will order these for sure next time. Service: Fast, efficient, and friendly. At 5:50 our server came by again to check on us, and to inform us that happy hour would be ending soon, but that she would be back to tell us when last call for happy hour was. When she did, a few minutes later, we ordered another round of drinks, which arrived about two minutes later.  For two people, we ate half the burger, half the fried stuff, and all of the spring rolls.

Tara L.,"Seattle, WA",212,344,710,5.0,12/12/2016,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory and have no idea why people rate it poorly! I have been coming to this location for at least 10 years now and I have never had a bad experience with the food or customer service. My personal favorite pasta that I would recommend is their 'pasta da vinci'. It is a penne pasta served with mushrooms, caramelized onions, chicken, and a madeira wine sauce that is heavenly. I always like to ask for extra sauce on the side. This most recent visit, I decided to also try out a healthy option. I ordered their kale salad which was the best kale salad I've ever had. It came with lemon vinaigrette, grapes, and bell pepper...I added a side of avocado as well. If you're ever hesitant to try this place, you definitely shouldn't be. I've had tons of their entrees, appetizers, and desserts, and I have enjoyed all of them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=60
Jinnie N.,"Orange County, CA",76,245,888,4.0,12/30/2016,"Impressed with the Happy Hour menu and it's value!!! I have been recently scouring the OC on a hunt for FABULOUS Happy Hour eats and I am glad to have re-discovered this place. Honestly, I was ""done"" with The Cheesecake Factory years ago because I was tired of the ""chain""/pre-prepped food for $$. Orange County is brimming with fresh non-cookie cutter eats for about the same price, so I stopped eating here.  However, the other night my friend INSISTED that we go to TCF with a bunch of girlfriends for Happy Hour. We went straight to the bar and we were able to get 2 tables INSTANTLY!!! This was one of the tedious things that I hated about TCF. In the past, I have waited 1-2 hours to eat at this chain. The bar was too easy!! They even allow kids, which I don't think was the case years ago.  Margaritas and other cocktails for $5!!!! I was also sweetly surprised that the margaritas were really yummy and not watered down to cater to the HH crowds. They rivaled Javier's across the way...who does NOT have a HH menu...Ahem!!! The eats were also really good for the INCREDIBLE prices!!! They were all about $5. We got loaded nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes, southern fried chicken sliders, fried calamari, parmesan garlic cheese bread, edamame, & kale salad...had to throw some greens in there!! EVERYthing was full-sized & freshly prepared...for a chain. We left there happy & content...especially for only spending about $20 each (including tip!!!!!).  The AMBIENCE in the bar was spacious & the noise level was good. All of us could carry a conversation with one another without screaming or yelling over one another. Another PLUS is that the bar area is near a window...which I love. One wall is all glass so you can ""people watch"" the folks walking around The Spectrum, which is something I enjoy!!! Will definitely have to come here again and try some other stuff!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=60
Ema V.,"Fullerton, CA",43,124,72,1.0,5/26/2017,"Came here for lunch in between wedding dress shopping. We sat outside on the patio. Emma was our server. I don't recommend coming to this restaurant at all. Has nothing to do with the cheesecake brand but more so the service. 3 of us order side salads with our meals and our salads came out with our meals. One of my pet peeves when going out to eat. Basically you are telling me that I have to eat my salad and my meal all at the same time now? Not to mention my food will be cold after I finish eating my salad. In the middle of our meal, my friend starting freaking out. I assumed she got a horrible text or phone call but when I looked at what she was pointing to there was a cockroach in her salad. YES, I am not exaggerating nor am I making this up. This insect crawled out from bottom of her salad and was just laying on its back in the plate. When we told the server she immediately went and told her manager. What really put me off was when the manager came to our table, she apologized but then decided to say ""that did not come from inside our salad, it probably flew into your salad out here."" UGH NO LADY! This roach was covered in salad dressing and would not been if it ""flew"" into our salad and it crawled out from the bottom of the bed of lettuce. Instead of taking responsibility she blamed it on us for eating on the patio. Didn't get the managers name, but she was female, blonde short curly hair and eyelashes caked on with layers of mascara. I wouldn't recommend coming to this restaurant. There are many other to choose from if you are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=60

My server, his name started with an ""S"" and he was Persian, seemed very disinterested in my table.

When we walked in we were seated immediately by the bar area next to a window, which was nice because we were people watching.  The lights at this location were very dim that my parents weren't able to read the menu. Our waiter was nice. My family decided on ordering the Hibachi Steak and I opted for the Chicken Garlic Noodles. The plate servings are huge, so if you get full fast either share or take some back home for the next day. My pasta tasted good and filled me up rather quickly. However, I did notice that the bottom of my plate was oily. I tried a piece of the Hibachi steak and that tasted amazing ! Next time I would definitely have to come back and try that. Towards the end our waiter brought out one ice cream with one candle and gave it to my brother who was furthest away from him and had to go in front of me to hand it to him. He then told him happy birthday then I think he remembered it was my birthday too and looked at me and said happy birthday to you too. It was really awkward because it was this small one scoop ice cream with one candle and a bunch of whip cream. We both blew out our 1 candle and he walked away.

Lara K.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,29,1,2.0,2/21/2017,"I don't eat at Cheesecake all that often, but I do get nostalgic cravings every now again for the Avocado Egg Rolls. Today, Feb 21, 2017 we dinned in for lunch because I had a Free Slice of Cheesecake to redeem. Sadly, I rather lost my appetite within the first 30 seconds of being seated as there was extreme dirt and grim everywhere I looked.  Essentially the restaurant is not getting any deep cleanings. No one is wiping the edge of the table booth benches and mountains of dried up food was plastered to the bench just under my hamstrings behind my knees.  Additionally, the top of the black granite baseboards are not being wiped down and had layers of dust on them.  While the waiter was friendly enough he had dirt and grime under his fingernails. The bread was served near cold and a bit hard which was disappointing as I love the sourdough baguette bread. The Avocado Egg Rolls were just OK, not quite as good as they could have been. I went to the restroom and saw the restroom door plate covered in fingerprint smudges, but thankfully I am tall and always push on doors high up, around the 6ft mark. In the bathroom I entered a stall to which I had to become a contortionist to even close the door and since I am slender I can't help but wonder how larger people get in and out of the stalls. Personally I don't allow my clothing to ever tough the toilet bowl but it's a very tight space and requires agile movements to not rub up against the stall and bowl. There was toilet paper on the floor and the toilet flushed before I was done, with its auto-flush. As I exited the stall I observed 3 Cheesecake employees enter the bathroom. It appeared they were tidying up the sink area but to my amazement they left a wet paper towel sitting in the center basin. Then a young girl went into the stall I'd been in and with her bare hands picked up the toilet paper from the floor. That might have been great had she washed her hands before exiting the bathroom but she didn't and all I could think about is where she was headed next.  After lunch, up at the Cheesecake counter I ordered two slices of cheesecake to go. The counter area was also dusty but by this stage I had to stop looking at all the dirt. I also informed the cashier that I did not need a bag. Apparently she didn't understand what I meant and asked me something about the plastic containers so I tried to clarify that I didn't need a carry bag and so she pulled out a plastic carry bag and said one of these as if she still wasn't clear on the issue and I said yes, I have my own carry bag so I don't need to waste more plastic and she just gave me a look of disdain, as if I was some weirdo. She also told me she would let me know when the order was ready and it seemed as if she wanted me to leave the bakery area and go wait somewhere else but there was no one behind me so I stood at the cake front. Next thing I noticed is she was packaging the wrong slice of cake. So I asked her if that was our order and let her know it was the wrong cake. It's fine to make mistakes, we are all human but her attitude was abrasive and she was not friendly or personable at all.  In the end I won't be eating again at this location because of how unbelievably dirty it was. I know the guys that bus the tables work really hard but unfortunately management is not ensuring proper cleaning methods of the tables, benches, chairs, baseboards, countertops, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=80

I got the four cheese pasta after seeing others recommend it on Yelp, and was not disappointed!  :) Other entrees ordered that were enjoyed included: The Cajun Jambalaya (perfect amount of spice), Vegan Cobb salad (lots of flavor but my coworker felt it needed salt), and the Tomato Basil Pasta with chicken.

My husband ordered pepperoni pizza. All of these are pretty standard dishes. All of these except the pasta Alfredo were salty. The calamari was salty, greasy, and soggy. The pasta carbonara and the pizza were both salty. The chefs tonight must love salt! I will say that the pasta in both pasta dishes was cooked perfectly. But that goes out the window when the entire dish is salty. I had to keep eating off of my daughter's plate because her dinner wasn't salty. I could actually taste the food unlike my dinner.

Our drinks were only refilled after asking multiple times. Another waiter (who was wonderful, I'm upset I missed his name) ended up taking our order because Alejandro was MIA. My father asked for more bread - it never came. My mother ordered a salad (from Alejandro, not from the good waiter). It never came. He never came to check up on us, and we sat with our empty appetizer plates crowding the table for ages until a busboy noticed and grabbed them up. We brushed it off and looked forward to our meals. Which were dreadful. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. My eggplant was undercooked. My mother had a dip sandwich that she said was all grease. My sister had a veggie melt, which she took a few bites of before abandoning for fries. The only one happy was my father, who had the Jambalaya and said it was very good. We would have alerted our waiter ... but he was missing.  By the time he reappeared, we'd given up and had a show to get to. In order to not be late, we simply paid and left.

Andrew D.,"Irvine, CA",0,12,1,5.0,8/14/2017,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm. and I have a relatively good experience. We had a much shorter wait than I expected; we waited only 15 minutes for our table. We got seated in back which had a nice view of the high rises surrounded the premise. Since it was a beautiful California afternoon, it was a rather pleasant dining experience with the large windows.  It did take a little bit of time for the waiter to introduce himself but nothing out the ordinary for a busy Sunday afternoon. Since we utilized our time to figure out what we wanted to order before getting a table, that's why it felt longer to get our waiter. Since I am a vegetarian, I ordered one of their many pasta options without the chicken. The waiter was very cooperative with that.  Once we ordered our food, the waiter bought us the delicious bread. We didn't care too much for the sourdough but devoured the honey brown bread. The waiter was very proactive in filling our table with the bread because we kept eating it. To be honest, this is one of the reason I wanted to come here. Our waiter was also very proactive on making sure our water cups were full. He would make a round every now and then and kindly ask if we wanted more water before pouring. We appreciated the fact he kept checking up on us and also gave us update on when the food would be arriving.  Once we got the food, the quality of the food was excellent. I think for my dish, they could have gave me more portion but the quality was excellent. I ordered the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta without the chicken. It wasn't the usual pasta I had at every Italian Restaurant and it was refreshing to have something different.  Since I stuffed myself with all the bread, I didn't have any room in my stomach for their signature cheesecake. My friends ordered a slice to go so I'll take a bite later.

The floor around our tiny table was sticky and there were crumbs all over my seat. While we waited for someone to take our order, we decided to take our food to go, which is something we don't generally do. When our waiter showed up, we were guilted about it because the tip would have to be split between her and another guy who had been helping us since she was too busy... Not our problem, sorry. The worst part of all of it was the food and the insane prices. We had a $50 gift card, which we thought would easily cover 2 pasta entrees, drinks and some cheesecake; wrong. Our total was over $60 and the food ended up making my boyfriend feel sick from the copious amounts of butter.

From kids' meals to chicken fettuccine to veggie burgers to Chicken Di Pana to Louisiana Chicken Pasta to Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and more!  Most of us took a piece of cheesecake home and that topped our experience. The cheesecake I had was the best I've ever had in my life!

What we've tried and may or may not order again: 1) Chicken Bellagio--crusted tender chicken breast but had way too much basil pasta What we've tried and will not order again: 1) Chicken Riesling--tasted somewhat bland.

Ahi Carpaccio - best thing ever.  Buttery Ahi Tuna thinly sliced with creamy avocado and tangy soy dressing. Bacon-bacon burger was so good. Full of flavor with light bunn and perfectly cooked crispy bacon. French frys were disappointing.  They were not as crispy as I  expected and lacked basic salt or any other seasoning.  Chicken Bellagio - was super exited to try on recommendation of waitress. The portion comes out rediculously huge. It is a meal for two. I wish they would offer half portion so you could justify a slice of cheese cake. Well, you started with lightly dressed arugula salad which is on top. Under I found two huge pieces of chicken.  Chicken was perfectly cooked with crispy breading. That's where positive ends pasta under chicken lacked in flavor.

The last time we went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum, we ordered lunch salads. Despite their being little to no people there at the time, it took 45 minutes for our food to come out. When it finally did come out, my friend's salad had a food sticker in it! We alerted our server, who took back the food to be remade and sent the manager over to speak with us. He apologized for it and let us know it was being remade.  After the remade salad came out, everything was fine with the food. We were there for about two hours and our server came around to check on us and refill waters only twice. After we left we were ticked that we had to pay for the salad that they left their dirty food sticker in, so we only left an 8% tip instead of the ""suggested 15%"". But to be fare, they messed up our food and the service was below average. Before I had even left the table the server came around and looked at the bills to find her tip-- while i was still putting my jacket on. My friends had already exited the restaurant, as i was leaving my server chased me down to let me know that her tips are taxed and we are supposed to tip at least 15%. I explained to her that i wasn't satisfied with the service and that tips are not mandated. She finally let me alone all pissed off.

Kimmy T.,"Lake Forest, CA",706,352,1702,4.0,6/25/2014,"Normally I like to support small businesses but it was my husband's birthday and he was craving cheesecake so he choose this spot and I couldn't argue. We parked in the structure nearest the movie theater and walked in.  I suppose you could valet for closer access to your car but we like a little spectrum stroll so the structure won. We walked in and there was about 10 people around waiting for tables but we only waited 10 mins or so - which I was thankful for since I got extra time to look at the menu. The novel-length menu gives me a mild anxiety attack every time.  Normally I'm a bit indecisive in ordering which is why I use my trusty yelp app to guide my restaurant endeavors but this trip my phone was dead so I asked our server what she recommended and she came back with ""Well what do you feel like?"" and all I could say was ""chicken"" so she directed me to the chicken page but I ended up throwing my hands up and letting my husband choose both dishes anyway.... go figure. If there's one thing I know about this place (besides the menu being 100+ entrees long) its that the portion is at least 3x the size it should be.  Thankfully, this trip around the menu stumped my husband as well so he and I agreed to share the two dishes he was between - it was his birthday after all. I ordered Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini.) and he got the Chicken Bellagio (Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad). He doesn't normally eat greens so I got his arugula salad which was nicely dressed with a lemon dressing.  My Cajun Jambalaya was really delicious. I was actually very surprised that a chain could produce such tender linguini and the spice was just right... I wouldn't consider it ""very spicy"" like the menu states.  It was flavorful without blowing my head off or anything. My husband gave me a bite of his chicken bellagio and the prosciutto/chicken/basil pasta combo was very delicious as well.  I was happily surprised!  We both ate about half and took the rest home... the price reflects the portion - at least you know you're going to have a yummy lunch the next day as well! We ordered a piece of banana cheesecake to share and it was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.  Sometimes cheesecake is too decadent to have more than 2 bites of... not this one. We definitely finished it. All in all, I was glad hubby chose this for his birthday meal.   I have a new respect for cheesecake factory and probably won't avoid it like the plague anymore... at least I know that I'll always have something new to try and I'll never exhaust the menu! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=300

I do enjoy that their menu is basically a little book and there are many, many options for eats here.  Always helpful when you have a large group of people with varied eating preferences.  But it is hard to make a decision sometimes when you have so many choices.  I do enjoy their Factory Burger Kobe burger and decided to try the Mushroom Burger since it recently won their Glamburger challenge according to the menu.  I enjoyed the sauteed mushrooms and melted Fontina and Swiss cheeses on the burger.    A nice burger but I still think the Factory burger and Kobe burger here are my favorites.  The fries that came with the burger were awesome, perfectly good and straight out of the fryer.  Everything on the plate arrived piping hot to the table, so that was great.   It is a very rare occasion I come to eat here and forgo cheesecake, since i LOVE cheesecake, and they have so many wonderful varieties here.  We decided to split their featured cheesecake which was the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.     Our waiter described it as not too sweet but extremely rich.  That was a perfect way to describe it.  It had a bottom layer of chocolate cake and had a layer of cheesecake with Oreos in it, Oreo cookie mousse and chocolate icing with an Oreo cookie wafer on top and a dollop of whipped cream on the side.  OMG, it was heavenly.  A perfect slice.  Definitely one I would order again.  An Oreo cookie lover's dream and not too sweet.  Our waiter, Johnny, was outstanding.  He was working hard, serving tables both inside the restaurant and outside on the patio, but he was such a great waiter, super friendly, very informative, attentive on our refills and checked back on us often.  A definite standout as far as servers I have had at any Cheesecake Factory.  Always nice to get out on a weekday, have a good meal, outstanding service and end the evening with a yummy piece of cheesecake :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=300

I got the tallest chocolate layer cake slice and a slice of Adam's crunch peanut butter cheese cake to go. These two slices will last for a week. They are big, rich in flavor, and dense in texture. I hate whipped cream but they didn't put it on top of cakes so I scraped them off as soon as I got home. I wish they ask before putting whipped cream chunks because not everyone likes the cream.  The crunch candy was like butter finger orange colored candy piece inside Adam's cheese cake was very sweet, also light peanut butter colored cream chunk on top of cake was also too sweet and nasty. But cheese cake itself was tasted very rich cheese cakey, and the cookie crust was perfectly thin and crispy.  Layer chocolate cake was very rich and dense. It was sweet, but it was also good enough to satisfy sugar craving with just a few bites.  I am set for sugar craving for a while and the two big cake slices will last for a while as well. They are pretty pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340

Service can be slow at times I enjoy coming to the Cheesecake Factory a lot because their food is always delicious. The best dish they have in my opinion is their Cuban Sandwich which has ham, pork, pickles, and mustard.  Their Sunrise Fiesta Burrito is also very good as well.  The location is very accessible and easy to find.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340

Ashley M.,"East Los Angeles, CA",37,60,13,3.0,5/14/2015,"The most unorganized Cheesecake Factory and restaurant overall that I've ever been to.  Waited about 20 minutes (I was told it was a 10 minute wait) and our beeper buzzed. Came inside and was told to wait on the side for my server... It's been an additional 15 minutes :) Group after group were being called with no response but they still waited for these people to show up when there's customers here that are ready to go. There has to be a better system but doesn't matter, we won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340
Mel R.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,3.0,7/4/2016,"Not my first choice in dining, but would be happy to go if invited with friends. Menu selection is good and probably why the restaurant is crowded.  From sandwiches to steaks, or ice-cream to cheesecake, there's probably something on the menu for every guest of your dinner party. I gave it a 3 star because the food itself is just okay and the service is hit or miss.  Though most of the time I have had good service once the food arrives; it's the long wait times to sit at a table or to finally get your food that take away from the enjoyment of eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340
Aaron D.,"Irvine, CA",5,9,1,5.0,7/2/2016,"The portions are big I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in over 15 years came with a friend I haven't seen in awhile, I have traveled all over the world , and had dinner at several fine restaurants. The food is awesome at the Cheesecake Factory. I can highly recommend  the Chipotle Chicken pasta and the Sheila's chicken and avocado salad . Our server armenica was the best she should be head server.  Don't forget to get the passion fruit mojitos to go with it and to finish off with the sea salted caramel cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340
Tricia W.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",21,4,,2.0,12/27/2016,"We were told the wait would be 25-30 minutes, which was not a problem.  Buzzer went off, so we went to the counter.  We were told to wait on the tile.  Twenty minutes later we were still waiting!  The slip with our party's name was misplaced.  After we  brought this to the manager's attention, we were seated.  Waited 15 minutes for our drinks after ordering them (mostly waters). Ordered food and had to wait 25 minutes for that to be served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340
Mike M.,"Long Beach, CA",18,12,,1.0,12/11/2015,"Attitude.   We walk in all smiles and on our runners high as we just finished a 5k down the road.  We walk up to the hostess kind of a short gal with dark hair she doesn't even look up from the computer screen she's just says how many??  Um.. Ok.. Party of four.   Again without even looking up from the computer screen she says - 15mins.   Wow! We sat down at the little bench seating near the hostess station. I decided to wash my hands before lunch and walk back up to her.  I asked where the restrooms were located and for the third time she refused to make eye contact, smile or even pretend that she's happy to be there-  she just says they're behind her or something.   I'm over this place and ready to walk but just then another gal says our table is ready.  We're hungry and decide to stay.   A different gal who brought us to our table said the rude gals name was Sylvia but who knows.  What I do know is this hostess is HORRIBLE. Our server was awesome and of course the food was good but our experience with the hostess ruined our $120.00 lunch.   Thanks Sylvia!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340

Michelle L.,"Irvine, CA",1224,1106,162,4.0,4/12/2012,"Cheesecake Factory. It's always been a place where I went with friends for hours of catch up over way too much food. It's always been a place where we stopped to eat after shopping and ogle at the rows of cheesecake and deciding before we even order our entrees what kind of cheesecake we are going to get. Maybe it's because I just have so many fond memories here, I find it really hard to dislike this restaurant despite the crazy long lines and food I get tired of eating half way through.  I've tried bits of everything here over the years and there is no doubt that the food tastes good. Yes its a bit pricey, but its huge so you can't really complain. My favorite here is the Chicken Carbonara and I usually stick to that now. I always want to get the cheesecake here but usually end up not getting any because I am simply too full. But the classic strawberry cheesecake is quite delightful.  Come here with your friends, grab a few drinks and laugh the night away. Or bring a lover. It's just as good. 4/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340
Jade R.,"San Diego, CA",327,295,593,4.0,5/21/2014,"I've never liked The Cheesecake Factory until I discovered their veggie burger. It sounds very lack-luster, but it is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. It's a hearty, yet flavorful patty that's served with a delicious garlicky-mayo.  And of course, the dessert! My favorite cheesecake here is the Banana Cream Cheesecake. It sounds gross, and a little boring, but it's absolutely delectable. Don't write it off before trying it! Another favorite is the Stephanie's Red Velvet Cheesecake- so utterly rich and tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340
Tim D.,"Tustin, CA",139,1,,1.0,8/28/2016,"So I've always known the cheesecake factory had exceptional food, but this experience completely ruined any good taste in my mouth. Nothing wrong with the service in particular just the manager Wesley!  So, my fiance ordered a mojito and it came garnished with a fluttering bug inside. She told the waiter she did not want to drink it, because she is creeped out by bugs. The server trying to recover the situation naturally brought a new drink for my fiance saying it was ""on them"" and he was so sorry for the drink she received prior. All was well til the bill came and the mojito was still there ""not on them"". At that time my fiance brought it to the servers attention and he said that shouldn't be on there let me talk to my boss. So the boss came to our table of 12 and asked so who had the bug in their drink? So she responded ""me"".  Feeling somehow like she did something wrong. Then the manager Wesley responded sorry we don't comp alcohol.  So my finances uncle left to talk to Wesley privately and let him know they didn't care about the $11 dollar drink it was about them charging her for it even though they said they would take care of it. Then Wesley told her that she should have told a manager not her server that there was a bug in her drink.(once again she feels she has done something wrong). Then she witnessed the manager go reprimand the bartender for the bug. And our poor server was visibly uncomfortable during this mess not having any power to enhance his guests experience. It took 20 minutes to remove the mojito from the check, and an additional 20 to process the payment.(probably a penalty for the complaint). I expected a higher degree of customer service from somewhere as corporate. But this company must clearly be going through a struggle if you hire people like Wesley to chase your guests away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-irvine?start=340
