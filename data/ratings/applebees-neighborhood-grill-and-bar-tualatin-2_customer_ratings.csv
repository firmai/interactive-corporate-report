BUY REAL STEAK APPEBEE'S and you won't have to marinade,over salt,over cook.  the service was very blah but no worse than other chain's who hire people who just don't care.  their menu is a bit non sensical in that they have a lot of low calorie items but no low calorie drink options. for your own profit why would exclude all your calorie counters from buying a beverage from you??(save diet cola). i been here sevral times before as my cousin like them but never again. there are way too many place to eat where i can get better food for less money. @megan..if i waste my time and money somewhere i will definatley write about it..being a chain is no excuse to serve food that bad and misrepresnt bottom round as steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2?start=40,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536

Our order was 2 buffalo wings, 1 bourbon street chicken, 1 sirloin steak, 1 riblets basket and the Oriental Chicken Salad.  The food tasted slightly above average and was not too impressed on the service. They didn't get the timing of when to come around for needs and refills on drinks. After we left the place somewhat satisfied, I started to feel uncomfortable hearing my stomach making bubbling noises and when I got home I ended up with explosive D*%$#@A! I called them a few days later not because of what happened that night, but because of the extra charges on my credit card. We did a 3 way split on the bill and ended up getting charged the whole bill including a separate charge that was split 3 ways. I explained to the male manager  what had happened with the my charges. He explained that it was a thing that is just pending? I really didn't understand the process and I wish they would have told me about it. Also shared about the explosive D*%$#@A! the night I ate (bourbon street chicken). I let him know to maybe check up on the chicken being served so that others will not experience that.

I was pretty jealous of the great service they received. They have new software at the tables that assist in ordering food and making payment. I like the computer personally, but I do not expect to give a 20% tip to it. It helps you calculate the tip, and I felt odd leaving my server a large tip for very little customer service.  However, the server behind us definitely deserved one for friendliness.  We ordered the Pretzel Sticks with Beer Cheese Sauce, The All American Burger, a half rack of Chipotle Ribs, and the kids mac and cheese with mozzarella sticks. The pretzels were fried and the cheese sauce tasted just like Gustav's Restaurant fondue. I don't think I would order them again. The burger was not half bad. I liked the consistency of the meat with the bacon, onions and pickles mixed in. I was happy to see some pink in it. The rest of the burger was unremarkable. The ribs were standard for this type of restaurant. The kids mac and cheese was the common kraft clone variety.   I really wouldn't go out of my way for a Applebee's, but it happened to be there, and really is not the worst you can do.

Within the first 5 minutes of being there we were asked 3 times if we wanted to order- to which we obviously needed to say no because we didn't know a thing about the menu.. and after it took them probably 10-15 minutes to come back again.  When our server finally came, he seemed very in a rush to take our order- until someone mentioned the margaritas. Suddenly he was VERY talkative to tell us all about how he has sold the second most ""perfect margaritas"" in the district.. which is only because the bartender was first. End of friendliness.  About 5 seconds later of my friends deciding- he repeats their orders as if hurrying us along to leave, almost overlooking me ordering completely.  As it was late at night- happy hour was posted ALL over the building, we all of course ordered appetizers myself getting a couple clearly included in the half off deal.  About 10 minutes later we get our food and my friends who ordered exactly the same thing got twice as much food in their servings.  When we asked what was going on- he told me I clearly ordered the full price ""sampler combo"" which was absolutely not the case. Never was the word sampler used, never did I point that out somewhere, etc. He continued to argue that I had apparently pointed to something that made him think I wanted the option that would get me literally half as much food and pay a dollar more- and this NEVER made him think maybe he should point out the deal I could get or ask to clarify.  Instead of just clearing up the mistake, he continued to argue until my friend just simply asked him to bring the remaining food I wanted and was going to pay for.  Another 10 minutes later he brought the rest of the food, set it down without saying anything, walked away and never said anything to us again. We paid at the table side payment machine and never saw him again.  Again, I didn't have the highest expectations for an Applebees at the end of the night- but this server was unprofessional, rude and made us all feel uncomfortable. None of us are the types to complain in restaurants- but 4 of us could clearly see his argument for what he did was faulty and downright deceptive.  Server aside- it was also freezing to the point where we were all wearing coats and sitting close to each other to stay warm. They clearly didn't want people to stay around any longer, or deal with us any more than they absolutely had to.

I was pleasantly greeted and sat then after a few minutes Michael came and introduced himself in a very rushed or OMG somebody sat my section way. Then when I asked him for a virgin Mudslide he said,"" you know that is only a chocolate milkshake."" I said okay... Then he looked at me like I was dumb turned to my husband and said,""you want anything?"" He looked appalled then said we needed more time. Michael rolled his eyes then said,""well do you want me to order that chocolate milkshake."" I said no. So he turned and left the table. We got up and left.

32,Rose E.,"Portland, OR",447,462,2334.0,3.0,2016-09-14,"Applebees is one of my husbands favorite chains. He always gets the same thing.  They seemed a bit rushed this time. There was no wait for us to be seated, but we must have arrived at just the right time, because some parties did have to wait a bit.  Since we always get the same thing, we were ready to order, and drink & food orders were taken quickly, but food orders weren't put in to the kitchen in the order in which they were taken compared to the guests around us that were seated later.  I liked our server a lot. He made conversation with us as though he had time to do so even though he was pretty busy. Much appreciated.  I'm not sure if it was a manager or just a greeter, but another party had left their cell phones and both phones were safely retrieved and held for them. In this day and age, so many people have such a ""finders keepers"" mentality, that I'm very impressed by this. The couple was so surprised and relieved to come back and find their phones waiting for them.  We both made special requests/substitutions in our meals, and these requests either did not make it to the kitchen or on to our plates, and could have been resolved in a more timely manner,  but were fixed eventually. They accidentally offered our dishes to another table, but fortunately this was resolved before the dinners were served so it did not cause much inconvenience or delay.  This issue was not a surprise because I've noticed that every Applebees appears to have quite a high staff turnover rate. I've rarely seen the same employees there on consecutive visits.  I really like how Applebees tries hard to fit into the neighborhood in which they do business. The menu is similar wherever you go, but the decor varies based on location. At least they make the effort.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
43,james c.,"Seaside, OR",8,624,1.0,3.0,2016-10-08,We had not been to this store though we have been to several Applebee's over the years. Service was attentive. Management was visible which is nice. I ordered the Thai shrimp salad which I thought was good. My wife had the Asian chicken salad and was pleased.   The kids tried various drinks and different kinds of food depending on prejudice and past experience.  We had not been to this store before but know the brand is reliable. So did the Rotary exchange kids we were accompanying. It was a good lunch for a fair price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tualatin-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

33,Angela R.,"Portland, OR",133,175,637.0,5.0,2017-01-10,"Loving this escape!! Soup, breadsticks and a screwdriver while my car is broken down.  My truck broke down across the street, to my pleasant surprise, here was an Applebee's. I went inside and glanced longingly at a booth for four by the window that could see the parking lot for when my ride arrived, with out hesitation and even though I was flying solo, the host said ""I can sit you here"" and in a hospitable gesture gave me the spot. They were full. The next party of two had to wait for a spot. I was very grateful. They acted like it was no problem at all.  Next, the food was great. French onion soup and a screwdriver to kick off my visit, then pretzel- sticks and cheese dip... and another screwdriver. :-) yummy. The soup was grade A! Not watery, perfect balance of bread onions and cheese. A must have now, in my book. The atmosphere here is really comfortable. Not overwhelmingly bar like, I find that with some Applebee's. The TVs are present but placed so that your eyes miss them unless you choose to watch.  I like it here!
