4,Amy B.,"McCall, ID",3,21,,2.0,2012-03-23,Food is what is expected for Applebees. Do not expect to get in & out in an hour. Salad and soup does cost extra as a side.

3,Mike A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,43,9.0,1.0,2012-07-24,"Food is gross, Service is worse. Ordered Carside To Go, specifically asking for no mushrooms in my meal. Get back to my hotel, and it's littered with mushrooms. I call them and let them know that I'm allergic and the dish needs to be remade.  Manager is nice enough to comp my meal, which is really the least they can do after wasting a half hour of my time driving back this late at night. The food is obviously reheated, as the spinach has completely wilted and the chicken is covered in condensation. The first to-go container was room temp, and this one is super hot. I call back to make sure they didnt just reheat a dish I was allergic to, and they assure me it's fresh. It is actually worse if this is a freshly made dish, considering how unappetizing it is. So I dig in, and it's gross. I'm starving, but this is borderline inedible. And all it took was an hour of drivetime and waiting. Applebees isn't that great to begin with, but this one is particularly bad. Oh yeah, and my hot dessert was given to me cold. I'm in a hotel and don't have a microwave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boise-7?start=40,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
0,T B.,"Newcastle, CA",0,3,,1.0,2013-02-01,"I was in Boise on a business trip this week two of my associates and I decided to walk over, from our hotel, and have a few drinks... First off the waitress took forever, she kept apologizing for the delay stating that they were so busy, and we understood that because there was a few people there, but the fact of the matter was not to many to serve us.. So the drinks finally came and we were having a good time, we decided to take one shot each, thats it one....one more beer and then one more beer, the waitress comes up and says that her shift was ending so maybe we could close out with her and another would take care of us, I had no problem with this but when the ""other"" waitress never came we started to wonder... had they forgotten about us? were they ignoring us, we are from Calirornia, or what was going on??? Then the manager comes over and says "" my staff and I have come to a conclusion that we are not going to serve you anymore"" ???? What??? Why??? we had done nothing wrong or for the slightest bit been out of line, but I have an idea as to why....I am a white man the woman i was next to is an african american and there was a table next to us,all white men, who by the way were having shot after shot and I counted five each in the same time frame with beers, is Idaho so backed up with the times that they cannot see, that other people deserve the same respect?  I was and am very disapointed with their actions and would not recommed this establishment to anyone who is not from there, apparently they are not with the times",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boise-7?start=40,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

Best to go early or late.  From 6-8pm they're swamped most nights of the week. I sit at the bar, which is usually very busy, and the bartender/server gal does a fantastic job.  She's a real go-getter who stays on top of all her bar customers as well as pouring drinks for all the other servers. My meal?  Very very good.  Bourbon Street Steak, medium rare and cooked to perfection.  Mushrooms and onions on the side with fried potatoes.  It's very good, fairly cheap ($14) and comes out piping hot on a sizzling platter ala fajitas.

2,Jim K.,"Novato, CA",7,45,,2.0,2014-07-20,"Bad service here. I don't usually eat at chains like this but I was staying at a nearby hotel, so I ate here out of convenience.  I sat at a bar table and the server came by and wiped it with a wet towel. The only problem was she left it soaking wet! Of course there were no napkins on my table so I had to grab some from another table to wipe it dry myself. I ordered a Blue Moon draft with a lemon. It came back with a lime. I then ordered a steak and baked potato. She asked if I wanted the potato loaded, to which I said yes. I had no idea this was a $2 upsell; I only noticed it on the bill. It came out looking like I would expect without the extra charge. The beers here were a pricey $5. $25 and change for average food and poor service. Too much. The next night I ate across the street at the bar in another hotel (I think it was called the Sports Page) and the food and service were much better.

When my waitress asked him for me if they have new castle his response was don't ask me if we have crappy beer. Maybe his beer knowledge is limited to just Applebee's or maybe he is one of those craft beer snobs. The food is mediocre and the service is worse. I say go any where else even the damn grocery store before coming to this place.

28,R W.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,24,2.0,4.0,2015-01-17,"I'm always a little surprised when people give a place like this one star. Unless the food is total swill (read: you'd walk out rather than eat it) or the servers are obnoxious beyond repair, it just seems a little unfair. I mean, it's Applebee's...if you go here looking for Top Chef you deserve one star for idiocy.  I ordered chicken tortilla soup, it was in front of me five minutes later and was pretty tasty. I then ordered a salmon dish that was forgettable but once again, I wasn't there to take pictures of the food, if you know what I mean.  My server/bartender, Austin, was ON IT and super friendly. He hooked up a solid libation. That and the Clippers game and I was good! Food:3  Service: 5+ Drink: 5 For the record, I must state that I do not love the food at Applebee's. That being said this place is only A five minute walk from the Fairfield  and it is the only option that is within walking distance..

38,Kyle C.,"Kent, WA",22,97,116.0,1.0,2015-01-24,"Like every other time I've been to Applebee's, it wasn't by choice. It had been a while since I had been and this was the group pick of where to have lunch so there ya go. I tried to be optimistic because I hadn't been to Applebee's is while, so I thought things could be different. At first it was fine. The staff was pleasant and the environment was nice. They had lots of sports on TV and a little computer on the table in which you could order from. I got the triple bacon burger thinking that would be an easy lay up for any restaurant. Then I saw my food come out... I don't know what I was imagining would find its way to my table, but what I got was like something from a drive thru. It was on the smaller side and all disheveled from itself. I know making the diner assemble their own burger is normal now, so I'll let that slide. The fry sauce I got was served in either a small shot glass or a large thimble, don't know which. Basically, it's a portion problem. Maybe I'm a fat assed American, or maybe I'm just a normal American who already worked eight hours that day? The taste is just okay. Every dish was just okay.  I don't want you to think I hate you Applebee's. I don't. You just don't do it for me. I don't have an answer for your problems either. It's just you. And it's just okay.

40,Brad S.,"Boise, ID",0,7,,4.0,2016-03-27,"It's hard not to shake your head while reading through some of the reviews for this location.  One of the most unfortunate things about Yelp is the screening (or lack thereof) process.  People come with unrealistic expectation and then write an emotionally driven post about it.  Please understand what you are walking into.  Applebee's is what it is.  They don't advertise as a 5 star steak house experience nor do they advertise the best burger in the world.  For what they do advertise, this location is on point.  I'm back and forth from the airport frequently and this is a good stop.  You will get good service and your food will be the correct portion as laid out by the company spec.  There is one post in particular that the girl gives ""1 star"" because her procrastinating boyfriend had an expired ID and was trying to order booze and the server denied it.  Guess what, that server did EXACTLY what he/she should have.  It is illegal in ID to have an expired ID, let alone be served alcohol with one!!!  Yeah, sure lady, this server is going to risk their job, possible jail time, possible loss of license to the business (which would put them out of business) because your BF can't get his license renewed in a timely fashion.   It's people like this that are everything that's wrong with YELP.  So, if you are looking for a decent meal that isn't gonna break the bank and you are choosing Applebee's, be realistic in your expectation.  I have been here 6 or 7 times the last few years and it always serves the purpose.  If you are business and traveling solo, sit at the bar if Austin is working.  He's sharp, professional and will chat sports with you any day.  Oh ya, and for a big chain, they do a good job of serving a rotation of local beers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boise-7?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

The wings were brought out next.  I took a bite (while hoping Dallas wasn't going to score a touchdown) and was chewing and swallowing my first bite and noticed that the wing was raw - not a little pink but RAW (see my pic). I do like my steaks cooked to medium but my chicken needs to be fully cooked because of my silly aversion to salmonella poisoning.  I notified the server,  she took the plate and left.  A few minutes later the manager came out and apologized and stated a new order was being prepared.  I thanked him but declined.  He didn't charge me for the wedge and my drink and offered me the wings to go.  I didn't have an appetite at that point.  If you go,  you should probably avoid the wings and check any chicken you order to be sure that it is cooked enough to be safely consumed.

13,sizzle G.,"Eugene, OR",0,64,136.0,1.0,2017-04-02,If you have 5 tables in the entire restaurant and your day has just begun there is absolutely Zero excuses for horrible service!  The manager 4/2/17 @noon was a disgrace and a lazy example the 2 other staff members doing nothing except holding the wall up! A stack of dirty dishes sitting on our table throughout this meal was GROSS!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boise-7,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
16,Julie G.,"Orofino, ID",18,11,15.0,4.0,2017-04-07,Excellent service. Great food. Had the steak and shrimp and the steak was tender and juicy. My husband had the porkchop and it wasn't dry at all.

14,Addie G.,"Milford, UT",0,11,,2.0,2017-07-04,"There was about 4-5 tables filled in the whole place, yet we were all shoved into the same corner. The waitress came around 3 times. Once to take our order, once to check on us, and then once to give us our check. What happens when they are busy? What really set me off to leave a review is that my husbands burger was very burnt and had a hair in it! We just got a ""sorry"" it was clear she didn't really care. She offered us a new burger but he declined since we were about to leave, and he had lost his appetite. We ended up still having to pay for the burger. We would've accepted the new burger and given it to our dog or something if we knew we were going to have to pay 12 bucks for a burger he took 3 bites out of! We didn't want to be obnoxious customers and ask not to pay for his meal, but I was kind of shocked she still made us pay for it.  I don't know if she didn't care because she thought we were looking for a free meal or what. My husband took 3 bites out of his hamburger, so obviously that wasn't the case. My mom was the one who actually told the waitress since my husband and I hate having to confront staff with complaints. I'm disappointed with the lack of care with how disgusting it was, and for charging us even after we mentioned it and she could see that he hardly ate any! Terrible customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boise-7,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

9,Sandra M.,"San Ysidro, CA",27,46,57.0,4.0,2017-08-29,"I'm surprised on how good the steak was perfect medium rare , the baked potato on point and even broccoli tasted yummy , the service was super good the only thing I don't like is the tablets in the table , I almost got charged   1.99 for using it to see what games they had I draw something, the table tells you 1.99 unblock all games but they charge you if you use it automatically to your bill . Unlike other restaurants where you have some free games and you can pay for the nicer once . Back to food the 2 for 25 menu is great and also half price appetizers from 3/6 and from 9 to close the wing are actually good !!! Not the steak quesadillas poorly served .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-boise-7,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
