Tydell T.,"Tomball, TX",0,3,,5.0,1/19/2011,I love Chilis!!! Every time I go there not only is the menu filled with great choices the atmosphere and people are cool.  I love the spinach dip is keeps me coming back for more. The two can dine is the best choices of any ones around. My friends and I can be on a budget and still enjoy everything Chilis has to offer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairburn
