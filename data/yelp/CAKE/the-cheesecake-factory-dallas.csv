Ramon O.,"Dallas, TX",103,3,,1.0,3/5/2017,"This place is alright. I ordered a Mac and cheese Burger and it came out more like Mac and Shit looking burger.  All I'm saying if I'm going to pay for a almost 14$ burger at least make it look good. The waitress was great, did an awesome job just the food was shit ! For a somewhat fancy place at least make the food look better !! Probably more then likely won't be back to this place ! Would rather drive the extra 20 mins to go to then one in Allen !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80
Sally L.,"Waco, TX",6,1,7,4.0,1/7/2017,The food is very good as always. My friend ordered a steak as medium rare but the kitchen got it wrong and made it standard.

Misty S.,"East Dallas, Dallas, TX",98,8,,5.0,12/18/2016,We always go to the Cheesecake Factory. It's not only at a great location but we love how many choices they have on their menu. We really like their strawberry daiquiri's. I always order one an it hits my sweet spot just right. It's always clean including the bathrooms which is such a positive for me. Their service is always good. Their food is always very pleasing to me and my family. We usually order a slice of cheesecake to go. We love this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80

Dan L.,"Dallas, TX",79,240,24,3.0,5/3/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a family friendly chain restaurant that is very popular.  I'm torn between giving this place a 4 or 3 star review. Here are the pros and cons as I see it. Pros: - Food was pretty good for a chain restaurant - Good location, close to our house and Northpark Mall but without the crazy parking and congestion of the mall - Our server was ok, not the best, not the worst - Dishes we enjoyed - Chicken Mediera, Chicken Alfredo and Jambalaya.  And the portions were quite generous - The bread they gave us was warm and delicious Cons: - It's a chain restaurant and Yelp can help you so many other great food options that aren't mass produced - Chicken Enchilada was not good, extremely salty - Overall, we enjoyed our food but have you ever checked out how many calories are in each dish?  It's very high! - Our server was ok, not the best, not the worst.  I gave our server a sweet tip even though it was formula chain restaurant service All in all, I think the family enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory.  It was a fun outing.  Lots of calories and nothing exceptional to write home about but once in a while, why not. I will try cheesecake for dessert next time...if I have room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80
Bless C.,"Addison, TX",53,3,,4.0,2/2/2017,"Lovely restaurant, I ordered the Chicken Madeira, it was delicious ! It comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus.

Thomas C.,"Dallas, TX",71,14,3,2.0,2/1/2017,So ummmm.... yeah. Ordered the spicy Chipotle pasta... it wasn't spicy but very sweet. The chicken has a honey glaze that greatly over powers the spicy sauce. And the menu doesn't tell you that it comes with tortilla chips on top.  the portion sizes is nice the menu is too much... too many options.. over 20 pages of items. My server was not happy that I returned my dish. Just don't tell me it's spicy and it's sweets. It needs not say spicy Chipotle.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80
Umesh A.,"Dallas, TX",15,23,12,4.0,12/21/2016,"My wife loves this place, been here multiple times. Food is okay, although I always struggle to order good vegetarian meal but she loves it.  Tip : Always buy Cheesecake Factory gift cards during holidays - it comes with 2 complimentary cheese slices for every $25 gift card (single slice cost easily $7-8 - so you save $14-16 by buying $25 gift card). You can get free dessert with your meal. Cheesecake slices are huge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80
Telecia C.,"Irving, TX",79,31,20,4.0,6/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is on my top 5 list of favorite restaurants! I love the variety of options and extensive dessert menu. On Saturday I had the crab cake sandwich and dulce de leche cheesecake.  Shhhh....the crab cake sandwich is not on the menu! The cheesecake costs about $8.50! Yikes! For my family of 4 we spent around $75 which included appetizers, sodas, entrées and 1 cocktail.  The portions here are very huge so you can definitely share with family and friends.

Autumn L.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,3.0,10/14/2017,So I'm not one to complain but I've been coming here a lot this year and every time I come to this specific location they are all sold out of ahi tuna. It doesn't matter if I come really early during lunch hours or early during dinner hours it always sold out. I don't know what the deal is but if they sell out of it so fast they must not be getting enough of it. I believe if you cannot supply enough of something do not put it on the menu. I go to several cheesecake factories all over and they always have tuna available yet this one does not. I come here specifically for it and it's disappointing when I find out the tuna is sold out yet again. Don't get me wrong the service is great and the food is amazing but when they are continuously sold out of this one specific thing it gets pretty aggravating.  The three stars are only for the availability of food everything else is great concerning this company!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80
Marissa B.,"Dallas, TX",7,82,1,2.0,2/20/2016,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory but this location was a let down. We waited for our server for over ten min before he came and asked for our drink order. He didn't bring any bread or water, I had to ask for it 10 min later. I then received the wrong sandwich and he took it back, gave me a salad and said ""you get a free salad for waiting"". Haha oh thanks! Wow a free small side salad for my troubles! I got my sandwich and hoped that he comps some of the meal or something on the bill, which he did not. Horrible service last night!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80

Maybe it's just me but the way I was raised, you don't ask questions like that or make comments about someone else's body, especially a stranger's.

Nesha M.,"DeSoto, TX",73,1,,2.0,7/7/2017,"My husband and I went to TCF on this past weekend while the food was its usual delicious, the service was unusually slow for a Saturday before 5. That wasn't the worse part, a family at a table across from us was having trouble with the salt shaker. It seems that it was too full. Instead of emptying some out on the table, the man decided to use his dirty finger to mash some down into the shaker. However when that didn't work he blew the excess on to the floor. Other people have to use that shaker that you just blew all over!!! That's not Cheesecake's fault! However, since when is it ok to bring a huge trash bag full of trash from the dessert counter, through the main dining room (past my table) to the kitchen area. I didn't need to see that. This was a very unpleasant visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80

That's my favorite appetizer. Also the kale salad. The lettuce wraps are good as well. The peanut sauce is delicious.

Je M.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/6/2016,"We visited this location today and ordered three slices of cheesecake, two water, a cup of coffee and the factory nachos.  Our plan was to eat dessert only since we had just ate dinner a few moments prior at another restaurant, First issue; the red velvet cheesecake consisted of a 2 inch layer of cream cheese icing..that ridiculous.  we sent it back. Second issue: One of the slices of cheesecake was brought out frozen-how are we supposed to eat that.  kept it anyway. Third issue: We ordered one cup of coffee and only drank one cup.  The waiter never asked my mom if she wanted a refill.  I asked him if I could get a refill of the coffee in a to-go cup, and he stated that they don't have any to-go cups for coffee.   We will not be visiting this location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=80

Nini N.,"Fort Worth, TX",16,209,607,3.0,4/17/2016,"This is probably my least favorite Cheesecake Factory location. Food was cold, taste was mediocre and the waitress was not fond of us. I could tell since she walked around frequently and didn't stop by our table until we waved at her or until she assumed that we were done. I got the factory Meatloaf and it tasted heavy, I ate about 3 bits and was done.. The chicken Alfredo from the kids menu tasted better than that. The salad was okay, the chicken was awful. Overall it was a tasteless meal. I didn't enjoy it very much.

I will advise you to try the crab and artichoke dip it is so good! I had the bang bang chicken and shrimp which was good but for a Thai food lover it wasn't the right amount of spicy for me!

Henry J.,"Arlington, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2017,Terrible experience. After waiting over 30 minutes for the food. My wife got a hamburger and I ordered the Steak Diane with shrimp scampi. What a disaster. The mushrooms on the steak were charred to a crisp. It appeared that they had been burned and yet they decided to bring out the dish anyway. But wait there's more......the manager came to our table to address the unappetizing meal. She was extremely insensitive and notified me that it would be 15-20 minutes to get a replacement dish. I declined the offer after my stomach churned from the sight of the disgusting look and smell of the dish they presented me earlier. I ate from my wife's meal. It wasn't just the meal that disgusted me but the actions of the manager who really didn't give a Fuck about the service or food.  This place should close down and find new management. Will never eat here again and I would not recommend you eat there either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=60

Came here for a birthday (which was ruined) had a waitress that didn't care at all(Ashley). Our table at sat there for 15 mins without being recognized and then Ashley comes over with a bad attitude. Was told there was no brown bread for the day but the table next to us had brown bread and later found out it was a lie. We ordered appetizers, drinks and food all at once since it wasn't that busy but just to knock it out. We then got a new waiter Justin who said there was a shift change. We never got the appetizers food came out an hour later. And drinks had to be told several of times how to make. The manager came out trying to make things right but didn't said he would get the appetizers out immediately...it took another hour to come out. All in all birthday ruined with horrible food. And out of over $200 dollars for horrible service and food.

Tiffany H.,"Garland, TX",2,5,8,5.0,4/23/2016,Food:  I got the pasta with shrimp & sausage. It was yummy but I think I still would prefer the Louisiana chicken pasta (I m have gotten this dish in the past). However the pasta with shrimp & sausage was still amazing! Service:  The girl that was waitressing my table was so adorable! She seemed so genuine and happy to help! I didn't catch her name but the service that she gave my table really turned 4 stars into 5 stars! Although we did have to wait an hour and 45 minutes for our table.

Best R.,"Dallas, TX",42,34,1,4.0,3/19/2017,"I started coming to The Cheesecake Factory about 15 years ago and I would usually get pizza because it's so delicious and the menu was huge. I now still come occasionally and I love the meatloaf, herb crusted salmon, cuban rolls, and desserts (especially the cheesecake)! You have to love the free fresh soft yet crispy bread. The food is delicious. However, certain dishes could be be better and the menu is so loaded it can be overwhelming. A few years ago for example I ordered some kind of shrimp dish and the shrimp they use is very fishy. I'm a huge shrimp fan, but couldn't handle it, so I simply never ordered it again. The service is good, but could be improved. I love the artistry and design of the restaurant because it's absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere is way too loud just because they are always so busy. I feel like they need to open another location in Dallas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=60

Ryan H.,"Dallas, TX",226,129,70,3.0,5/27/2016,"Not worth the _____. That blank can be filled with: waits, price, you name it (and yes I said ""waits"" with an s; twenty minutes after their original estimated wait time, when your buzzer finally goes off, there's another queue, awkwardly in the way of food runners, before you ACTUALLY get seated). If Tolstoy were in charge of making a menu, I would expect it to be slightly shorter than this. Somehow with boundless options, the macaroni and cheese burger seemed the way to go. I expected a cheesy mac to sub for cheese (like the queso in a queso burger I recently had elsewhere). Instead, it was a relatively flavorless ball of fried rigatoni with only a hint of cheese. What it lacked in flavor, the macaroni ball added in sheer height to the burger, making a detachable jaw a near necessity when attempting a bite. Choosing a cheesecake, the very namesake of the entire restaurant, was another dilemma. Should I go simple? Fruity? Chocolatey? I couldn't refuse the  mango key lime. Apparently I also can't assume fruit based cheesecake is even remotely naturally flavored. I think the syrup from canned peaches are more natural than the orange goop on top. The lime flavor was weak too.  The food was satisfying, and it's not as if anyone's saying it's the best restaurant in town, but the hype/price/waitS to quality ratio is too dang high.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=60

We chose the warm crab and artichoke dip for appetizer - it was good. No show stopper, nothing out of this world, just good. I had the Chicken Madeira as my entree... It was okay. The cheese just tasted awkward, fake almost. My husband had the Steak Diane, he liked it. Nothing to brag about. The ultimate safe zone for this dinner was the dessert, we had the turtle cheesecake - now that was the bomb! (Surprising? As it is known for it's Cheesecake?) For the price paid, I think we'll just stick to grabbing dessert here in the future.  Service was good - our waitress was extremely friendly.

Persia A.,"McKinney, TX",308,397,357,4.0,12/6/2015,"Usually crowded, but that's to be expected in an area like this. Right across from North Park mall and immediately off 75, they do also have outdoor seating, albeit small - but with heat lamps! We had the option to wait 20 mins or sit immediately outfit. We sat outside and had great service. It is a little weird having passers-by stare you down, but I guess that's what you sign up for.  We ordered as an appetizer the assorted eggrolls (forgot the menu name) and although it was good, it was very filling for two people to share.  Here's the rule about The Cheesecake Factory: everything is giant. And fatty. By the time we finished out appetizer, we didn't even out a dent in our entrées. So in retrospect, I probably would have maybe ordered from the Small Plates menu for my ""entrée,"" and we were pretty hungry! Also keep in mind they bring you free breads and butter before the meal.  The ambiance of this place is a nice-casual, a good place to take a date. You COULD go in in jeans, but if you're paying $15 min for your entrée alone, at least wear a nice top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=60
Lisa T.,"Chicago, IL",243,173,699,2.0,8/1/2015,"Food (3/5) In celebration of National Cheesecake Day, boy and I came in to pay our respects. We had the complimentary bread (shoutout to the phenomenal brown wheat bread!!), entrees, and a slice of strawberry cheesecake. My entree order was the Shrimp Bistro Pasta. Tossed in a lemon cream sauce, the spaghettini also contained battered shrimp, tomato, arugula, and mushroom (though I asked for the mushrooms to be removed). The pasta tasted great for only two bites because it was so stinkin' RICH. The cream felt extremely heavy and ultimately made me feel sluggish and gross for consuming so much. Now, also consider that the portions at Cheesecake Factory are HUGE, thereby making the whole eating process completely uncomfortable. For future visits, I'll probably ask the waiter to box up half my order ahead of time, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel like I was going to have a heart attack afterward.  And we hadn't even had the cheesecake yet!! Granted, the cheesecake was a good level of fluffy, so it may not be to people's liking if they prefer the ""harder"" cheesecakes. Crust was delicious but I could probably do without the excessive amounts of whipped cream. I could see it being too overwhelmingly sweet for some palates as well.  Service (0/5) One question can summarize our service experience that entire night: where is our waiter??? We were there for about 1.5-2 hours from initial seating to final payment of the bill. I understand it can get busy, but I would have appreciated a slightly quicker pace and/or more transparency in his slowdowns. Atmosphere (3.5/5) Decor in Cheesecake Factory is the same as all others nationwide. Plenty of booth or table seating in hues of brown and beige. I would have given a 4 for atmosphere but it felt way too crowded and the tables were packed next to each other.  Bottom Line Food is good up to a point but it's extremely heavy and rich so I'd probably try to better portion control next time. Had very bad luck with service so hopefully it's better next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=60

I came here Monday for lunch with the bf to celebrate a BIG promotion for work. We got the fire cracker salmon, Jambalaya pasta and Chicken Bellagio.  When we were done eating the pasta, we waited for 15 mins for her to get back to our table and all she said was ""I'll come back for some to go box"" since we have some left over pasta. She didn't even bother to ask if we need or want something else. Mind you, she passed our table a few times ignoring us for the whole entire time. Well she actually filled our water glass one time and we had to ask her for that. The other server who passed our table was too nice and asked if we need anything else... I asked if I can speak to a manager instead.  We wanted to get 2 cheesecakes and coffeee as well. We came here to spend money and celebrate but she is really not worth my time and my extra tip. She is the worst!!!   I've spoke to the manager and told him about Nichole. He apologized, and then offered to comp our cheesecake (he asked if we can meet him the take out area).  We got our check and went to the take out area to get our cheesecakes and coffee too. The manager who offerred to comp wasn't even there to meet us but it's ok. We were't there to get anything for free anyway but we were also kinda expecting him to be on top of it because I was really disappointed at that point and that server ruined our celebration too. I tipped the server at the take out area because Nichole doesn't really deserve any extra tip from our bill.  NICHOLE is here for lunch and I don't know about dinner but AVOID her at all cost.

Diane D.,"Rockwall, TX",327,384,282,3.0,8/21/2014,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory today for lunch with a group of 11. We started out with a waitress who couldn't remember the day's specials and she took one drink order (mine - for an iced tea), and then she mysteriously went AWOL. Five minutes later a gentleman with a loud voice came over and announced over the din that he would be taking over as our waiter. He seemed very capable and adept at handling large parties. A couple of the orders got mixed up and had to be sent back for a re-do but overall the experience was good. I ordered the lunch portion of the chicken carbonera. It was plentiful but I expected the sauce to be a little richer and creamier and not so watery. It's very rare that I've been to Cheesecake Factory and not thoroughly enjoyed my meal, so I would have to say this is a first. Fortunately, I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and I KNOW it will be awesome!

My husband has a cheese allergy, but enjoys their flat bread crust. I would think that since the pizza salad lunch is so expensive, why are the pizzas basically already pre-made? We frequent the Arlington location near the Parks mall and they have never had an issue making his pizza.

Connor C.,"Colleyville, TX",0,101,1,3.0,1/5/2016,"I've eaten at numerous Cheesecake locations and used to visit the Northpark location fairly regularly.  First, I have to say the food at Cheesecake is honestly really good quality compared to other chains. I have heard they make everything from scratch on-site (with the exception of their bread and cheesecakes, ironically). You can taste that it seems better quality than a lot of other restaurants. My favorites there are the spicy cashew chicken, chicken tenders, pizza, Caesar salad (romaine always tastes fresh and plate is cold), southern chicken sliders, and the fried cheese. Really haven't had many issues with the food.  My main issue with this location is service. Often, if I'm heading in for lunch, I will go sit at the bar. For the past year or more, the bartender that always seems to be there waiting on me is just not friendly. I understand not everyone has an overly friendly demeanor, but he just doesn't smile, doesn't seem attentive, like he could care less whether you're there. I tried to ignore it, but it does make you not want to eat there when the bartender serving you isn't at least pleasant like they appreciate your business.  I compare this to the bartenders at another chain - Houston's - and the difference is night and day. The folks at Houston's aren't necessarily overly friendly, but they are always courteous and provide really attentive service, which is all I'm asking for.  I always feel I ask for the bare minimum and always try to tip 20-25%, but doesn't seem to help.  I hope the manager at this location will see this and have a talk with the staff in the bar area about how they are treating the customers. Until then, I will probably go to the Allen location.  Parking at this particular location is also terrible unless you use their valet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=140

Ann M.,"Corinth, TX",0,92,2,4.0,6/2/2014,"We arrived at grandma's house to discover that she must have went shopping with her 16 year old neighbor.  80 yr old grandma is wearing a belly baring shirt that says 'Geek' on it, along with very tall wedge sandals and a dragon patterned skirt.  Thankfully she has a button down sweater as well.  The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place to take 'that one friend' or 'that one relative' (you know the one) who just can't be trusted to behave in public.  The food is actually quite good and lack of etiquette and class seems to be acceptable or at least not frowned upon too much.  The atmosphere gives a false sense of it being a nice restaurant.  Your 'special' relative or friend will think you're taking them to a nice place.   We entered the door and noone gave grandma's attire a second look.  We were surrounded by a family of nose pickers while waiting to be seated.  Thankfully, we were seated promptly.   The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious and so was the bread.  Our nephew placed his foot on the seat, knee above table, to tie his shoe.  His lack of table manners was overshadowed by the large group of rowdy individuals sitting only a couple feet from us.  Tables are very close and the venue is extremely loud.  We could not hear those sitting directly across from us due to the way sound carries in the restaurant.  The birthday man sitting at the table next to us was blinged out for his birthday dinner.  His pants pockets, which sat well below his butt cheeks barely covered by his underwear, were covered in rhinestones.  His friends/family sang happy birthday to him three different times.  Of course, our nephew had to join in the singing every time.  Grandma joined in on the final song.  My husband and I began calculating how fast we could leave.  Our food arrived which was delicious, as always.  The food is overpriced for what it is.  We can eat at much higher quality restaurants with a nicer atmosphere for the same price, but we wouldn't dare take grandma or the nephew to those places.  Entrees are $14-$20 on average.   We notice our nephew holding his shirt over his nose.  We give him a dirty look and he tells us that grandma farted.  My husband can't take it anymore.  He starts dying laughing.  He orders a shot to get through remainder of the meal.  I'm speechless at this point and attempting to keep a straight face.   When you go to Cheesecake Factory, of course, you have to order Cheesecake.  That's another 10 minutes before we can escape.  Grandma orders coffee afterwards, another 10-15 minutes.  The night is dragging on.  I escape to the restroom to get a break from dinner at the zoo.  The floors are waxed with a substance that must be meant for slip n' slides.  I keep my balance and manage not to fall.  In the restroom someone else is very loudly passing gas and it's not grandma.  At least this person went to the restroom to do it.  Back to the table I go.   After another 15 minutes or so we are finally ready to leave.  Our nephew discovers the slip n' slide floors and runs to slide yelling 'woo hoo'.  We drop the nephew and grandma off.  We survived the night.  The staff at Cheesecake Factory act professional and treat you like royalty even when you bring problematic people.  I feel sorry for them, but I am thankful that we can count on them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=240

Alicia F.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2015,"Well I have to say I'm fairly disappointed in not only the cooks this evening, but the manager tonight as well at the Dallas NW highway location. Dinner with my family; husband and kiddos meals are fine. I ordered the Steak Diane medium rare. It came out medium well to well done. Our server Amy quickly sent it back and gave me an estimated time of 8 minutes.  About 6 minutes later I got a dish that was RARE. It was seared for probably less than 60 seconds on each side. ONE small medallion was edible.  I gave up. Amy checked on me while she was balancing a tray of what looked like a dozen pink lemonades, however by that time I was pretty much done. My family was finished and I told Amy I'd just eat some of the mashed potatoes. She was more than happy to offer me something else but I just wasn't in the mood to wait any longer.  I did request to have the meal removed from our bill, which is fair at this point.  Well the manager (who I won't name publicly) decided I needed to be charged for a side of mashed potatoes (which I only ate about half of) Incredibly tacky!  I would suggest in the future that if someone isn't able to eat the meal they ordered to NOT charge them a side order.  Bad move management, especially since you didn't even give me the courtesy to show back up at the table and ask me about the second time my meal was prepared incorrectly!

Mike S.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,6/6/2013,"Went to the local Cheesecake Factory for a date night with my wife. It started off normally enough. Excessive waits between server visits and long spells with empty glasses, but i've become used to this level of service from the CF. What really ruined the evening is when my wife's omelet arrived. She cut into it, worked towards her first bite and then pulled a clump of hair the size of a grape from the omelet. It was all she could do not to puke right then and there. Unfortunately, the (suddenly) attentive servers wisked the dish away before i could take a proper image, immediately destroying any proof. The manager (at least i think he was. he never identified himself) came up and appologized profusely (which i appreciated!) and asked my wife if she wanted anything while she waited for another omelet. She asked for a side salad.  At this point, i've put my food aside, because i'm not gonna eat while my wife waits. 15 minutes later the salad finally comes back. 20 minutes beyond that, the replacement omelet finally arrives. (My food is beyond luke-warm at this point. Ended up boxing it all up to take home and reheat) It was hair free this time. But then, they charged us for the side salad while she waited and for the omelet. I'm not saying we deserve free food, but c'mon. If i had been quicker on the photo-taking, this would have had an entirely different outcome.  I don't expect anything to come of this, but i felt it was my responsibility to alert other patrons (since apparently hairnets aren't a responsibility of CF). If you're looking to blow $50-$60 on a nice place, go somewhere else. You're wasting your money and time at this CF location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=240

The Khalua cheesecake is a tad boring and dry.  It's too much sweetness in serving since the crust is oreo and the cake itself is really sweet already. Finally, the Pineapple cheesecake is the motherf'ing bomb!  It's pineapple upside down cake sandwiched in cheesecake.  Very refreshingly fruity and the pineapples and the pineapple upside down cake add different layers of textures that adds to the experience.   Oh and all the cheesecakes come with the whipped cream from the machine in case anyone was wondering, I don't know why I only mentioned it on the first cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=240

Doing brisk business at lunch, must be popular with a lot of people. The menu is a virtual novella, with pages and pages of anything and everything, which is suspect in a restaurant trying to be all cuisine to all patrons. I went with the daily special, pecan-crusted catfish and sides (soupy mashed potatoes and some veg medley) and ordered a small side salad along with it. Food was not too bad, even though everything was so heavily doused with butter that was all I could taste. I nearly did a spit-take when I got my bill: $26! Guys, it's just a piece of _catfish_, not Chilean sea bass. There is no cheaper piece of seafood, and last I looked the price of butter was quite reasonable. Did not try the cheesecake, but that's easy to find elsewhere. Overall, you'll have a better experience (and cheaper) with almost any other chain like Cheddar's, Chili's, Black-Eyed Pea, or even an Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=240
Megan S.,"Dallas, TX",223,627,243,2.0,11/4/2010,"Pumpkin Cheesecake was the mission.  Cheesecake Factory had it- but they offered some a disappointing experience. I've only been to Cheesecake Factories maybe 2-3 times.  But they're always located in upper-crust areas, and the reputation is of a nice place.   Our experience didn't hold up their reputation.  It's possible that it was just this particular night, and not this location... Decide for yourself. We got there around 9:30 on a Friday evening.  They're open until 12 or 12:30, so this is hardly closing time.   What happened:  We had to wait to be seated, even though the restaurant looked only about 50% full.  And two parties of 4 were seated before us (just 2).   The floor was NASTY.  First you notice the grease and slippery funk on the floor.  But once you start looking down- there's so much to see.  Stray utensils pushed up against the wall, large crumbs of food everywhere.  Do you not believe in sweeping after the rush, but before closing? An entire row of tables, I'd say about 7 were in need of bussing, with stacked dirty plates covering the table, and some of the chairs pushed out into the aisle. (Maybe that explains the wait to be seated?) Speaking of dirty- As the hostess sat us at our table, she reached with her hand to knock some of the many crumbs off our table onto the floor.  So I guess they cleared the dishes, but didn't wipe the table- there were a LOT of crumbs. One of our water glasses, had a piece of food encrusted on the outside.  Thankfully the outside- but how good of a wash did that cup really get?  Also, one of the forks had the same treatment, good thing they give you 2.   We waited a while for the one piece of cheesecake we were splitting.  Not 20 minutes long- but maybe 15- which seemed silly based on our order. The cheesecake itself: alright.  We got the pumpkin.  Really it just tasted like dense and cold pumpkin pie.  I'm not exactly complaining- I love Pumpkin Pie.  Just thought this would be a different spin on the pumpkin flavor. Disappointed is the best word for this experience.  I would come back, but if it was just as easy I'd pick a different location.  Also- on the hunt to try some pumpkin cheesecakes at other places, as this one was not all it could have been.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=240

We decided to grab something to go since we also had laundry to do, so we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory, and called in an order.  SO ...Currently sitting and waiting for about an hour now for a meal in which was ordered about 30 minutes before arrival. I had ordered the pork chop dinner only to arrive 30 minutes later and stand in line for an additional 15 minutes to be told that the porkchops are still cooking. Another 10 minutes go by and finally being told that they ran out of pork chops and that I would need to choose another selection ... (55minutes into the order) ...  After waiting an additional 10 minutes after being given a menu, I stepped back to the register and was ignored for another several minutes before I was acknowledged. I ordered a Steak Diane, and requested bread and water to snack on while we waited. After another 10 minutes went by, I was asked how I wanted my steak cooked ... something I felt should have been asked when it was ordered. I requested RARE (#TeamVampire) to which another 15-20 minutes passed ... and I was given what appeared to be clearly medium well ... and to top it all off;  I never did get my bread and water ...  For this to be my first time in all of my 30+ years of life having anything from the Cheesecake Factory - I found this to be very disappointing. They should rename the establishment The Hunger Games because if you ever order from here -- ""may the odds ever be in your favor!""

After a 30 minute (excruciating) wait we finally found some seating at the bar and impatiently ordered some water and bread.

The best one we ever tried! The pasta was delicious, specially when we added with thesundried tomato!

Food: 4 stars Cost is a  bit of an issue on some items.  While that vegan cobb is a steal at $12.50, this is not where I would come for a $28.50 ribeye, a $20.50 steak diane, or a $6.95 side of asparagus, but that's always an issue with menus this large.  It's tough to be all things to all people. Price: 3 stars The setting is fine, maybe a notch below the aforementioned upscale price point.  Atmosphere: 3 stars The waitstaff is as professional as you would expect.  They know the menu and they know how to treat customers - very professional Service: 4 stars I'll average up, because the restroom was very clean, and will return for that awesome vegan cobb.

Max D.,"Dallas, TX",459,98,1203,1.0,5/13/2017,"One of the worst dining experiences i have ever had. First off i just want to say i was always a fan of cheesecake factory, large menu with good food and delicious cheesecake. I also rarely give one stars for most of my reviews but this was truly a one star experience.  Me and my gf stopped by after shopping at northpark mall nearby. The wait was about 30 mins or so even though we were past lunch hour stopping by around 2:30. We figured as much since its mother's day tomorrow. When we were seated the waiter was super short with us and obviously was in a rush since when we asked to order our food after giving our drinks order he said only drinks right now since he needs to get drink orders to his other tables first. Ok thats understandable.  I should have known things would go downhill when i received my drink order of a Belvedere on the rocks with a lime. The waiter got it wrong and it came back completely full and totally watered down not what i was expecting when i just wanted a shot on the rocks pretty much. I didnt complain since they were busy and didnt want to wait for another drink. Then the food eventually came and my gf got a sante fe salad and i got a four cheese pasta with chicken. Everything was great until i went for a bite of my pasta when i noticed a hair in it. That pretty much completely ruined my appetite right there.  We notified the waiter who brought the manager over who was truly sorry and offered to remake it which we said okay to. He also offered a complimentary salad or soup which we rejected. I had a couple bites of the remade pasta but just lost my appetite at that point. They eventually comped the pasta portion of the meal after my gf asked about it. They probably should have comped the whole meal. The waiter wasn't apologetic at all. The manager was and did say they are supposed to wear hairnets in the kitchen and he was truly sorry.

I normally come here for the chicken dishes and pastas.  The last few entrees were off in seasoning.  The dishes are not hot, as if it sat for a while before they delivered it.  The service is acceptable given how busy they can become, but a poor quality meal is unacceptable.

The menu is large so it is likely there is something on the menu to address finicky to hearty eaters. I highly suggest that if you are pressed for time with a large party, then you encourage your crew to check out the menu online before coming to the restaurant. As most visitors would say, the portions are large, even for a lunch menu. I would say the servings are in line with the price points. My lunch menu cobb salad was enough for two meals. In my opinion, after years of trying some of this and some of that in the menu, the salads are the most consistent menu items. But let's be honest, the place is known for cheesecake, and lots of it.

Years ago I used to come here for lunch or a slice of cheese cake but I think that my taste buds have evolved and now the food taste less that mediocre and for the price I know a thousand places that I would rather give my money. So I see now they have small plates. I ordered the toquitos and this bacon grilled cheese. The toquitos amounted to 2 tasteless deep fried rolls of flour tortillas laying in a puddle of salsa. Honestly I don't want to spend my time reviewing this establishment because the cheese cake was even disappointing,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas

I ordered the crispy spicy chicken sandwich and was disappointed because it was dry.   Aside from mediocre food and good service, the fly situation really bothered me.  This is the second time I see flies (small black insects that carry germs) at this location.   It's gross to see a fly land on food when someone is about to eat it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=260

Zandra E.,"Dallas, TX",669,482,78,2.0,5/4/2014,"I have a real meh/hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory and honestly, we've not been on speaking terms for a long time now. While I never had a bad customer service experience here and actually do like the desserts, the rest of the mammoth menu is a complete fail. Not only is the nutritional info not available on the website, but the food is notoriously unhealthy for no reason. I'm serious! You will be pickled by the time you leave due to the sheer amount of sodium found in their food thanks to people testing them to provide consumers a better picture of what they are eating. Again, I have no problem at all with eating unhealthy foods, but don't bill some things as healthy when they have more carbs, grams of fat, and calories than the worst burger combo you can think of at a fast food chain. Seriously, how do you make salads that high in calories and sodium?! Blah. So, unless you are really hankering to eat two-three days worth of calories in one day without feeling like it was worth it, I say avoid this place at all cost. If you are looking to pick up a quick dessert and are craving cheesecake or strawberry shortcake, this place may not be so bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=260

Kate R.,"Dallas, TX",80,421,62,4.0,3/3/2011,"We wound up here by accident a couple of weekends ago... driving around trying to decide where we wanted lunch. Started in Addison, wound up in Uptown, turned around at some point and ended up here at the Cheesecake Factory on Northwest Highway across from Northpark mall.  By the time we finally got here, it wasn't really lunch time anymore: it was around 3.30pm. There was a small wait, but it was just enough time for us to stand outside and my boyfriend to have a smoke.  We were seated at one of the small two-top booths near the front. Our waiter was pretty nice, and brought drinks pretty promptly.  The menu is absolutely gigantic, so it takes awhile to go through it and decide what you want. We thought we'd go ahead and order an appetizer... we were debating between the fire roasted artichokes and the fried artichoke hearts. Our waiter recommended the fire roasted ones, so we went with them. Of course, they were twice as expensive as the artichoke hearts, but there were 3 half artichokes, so it was quite a bit of food. They were delicious! Occasionally, we'd get a delicious flavor of grill and fresh pepper and some salt. Of course, whole artichokes are kind of a pain in the butt to eat, so you wind up with a lot of half-eaten/chewed on leaves on your bread plate.  So while they're delicious, they're a hassle. If you're trying to impress someone or on a first date, I'd recommend getting something else. There's no graceful way to eat half an artichoke like this, and you're going to have SOMETHING in your teeth afterwords. But yes, phenomenally delicious.  For the entree, I thought about branching out, but I wound up getting the same thing I always get: The Crispy Chicken Costoletta. So tasty! Yes, it's $16.50, but I got 3 meals out of it, so I think it's totally worth it. After filling up on the delicious warm bread and the fabulous roasted artichoke, I could only eat one of the THREE chicken breasts that came with my food.  It's three thin chicken breasts, coated in a tasty breadcrumbs (panko, maybe), lightly fried, and served with a delicious lemon sauce. The lemon flavor is definitely present, but not at all overwhelming or gross- both of which can happen with lemon sauce. The dish is typically served with mashed potatoes and asparagus, but I subbed broccoli for the asparagus, which they're always happy to do. The waiter says he does the same thing when he orders it. I really love it.. Even with the lemon sauce, the breaded chicken breast has just enough crunch on the outside, but is still tender enough to cut with a fork. It also reheats really well (and quickly, as it's pounded so thin). The mashed potatoes taste fresh, not instant from a box. The broccoli was mostly florettes- very low on stalk (personally, I'm a stalk lover, but I wasn't disappointed) and cooked properly. Food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time by a food runner.  Oh, one thing I found was super awesome? They brought us warm, wet towels to wipe our hands off with after the artichokes. Super awesome! Also, he brought more for my boyfriend when he ate his pizza.  Boyfriend ordered the Hawaiian pizza, and it was tasty, but not the best... they served it on a plate, and there's a chance that it sat on the plate for a little while before it was served because it was quite soggy in the middle. The crust had a very sweet and yeasty flavor. Not bad, but not exactly what I was expecting. The pineapple was clearly super fresh (not canned or frozen), which added a really good flavor and texture, and the Canadian Bacon was in big slices and not overly salty.  Oddly, even though I like the Cheesecake Factory's food, I'm not a super huge fan of their Cheesecake.. Their Original has a sour cream-type glaze on the top (no likey). Some of their specialty cakes aren't bad, but I don't go out of my way for any of it. Like I said, I know it's crazy. My boyfriend got a Carrot Cake swirled with Cheesecake, which I took a bite of... and it was pretty good. He wasn't enthused, but I don't know exactly why. I got the warm apple crisp thing. It was good, but damn it was huge. I could eat barely half of it-- and even if I hadn't gorged myself on artichokes and chicken/veggies.  I don't come to Cheesecake Factory often, but when I do, I know that the food is going to be tasty. Expensive as hell for a late lunch for 2 with appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts, and a soda... but tasty!  Call ahead on the weekends at ANY Cheesecake Factory to avoid a crazy wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=260

The wait time was 45 minutes to an hour that night, which is pretty ridiculous if you ask me, because if only they accepted reservations, this wouldn't have been an issue. We decided to just wait, because I was craving some cheesecake. The ladies at the hostess stand weren't friendly, which is something they definitely need to address. Absolutely no customer service skills. Our waitress however was very pleasant, she recommended great items from the extensive menu. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and it was delectable. So much flavor on the chicken and the pasta and the portion size was huge, the pasta can easily be shared by two people.

Marilyn M.,"Dallas, TX",464,436,115,3.0,1/29/2010,"This review is a challenge; I've vacillated between 2 and 4 stars, reluctantly settling on 3. Here's why:  Service - 5 definite stars  Atmosphere - 4 definite stars  Food - 4 stars  Price - 1 star  Love the atmosphere. It's both fun and sorta classy, in its own unique way. Just enjoyed the feel of the place with the pale yellow walls, various hand painted murals, mirrors and columns. Yes, it's almost an upscale spot but in a comfy relaxing non-stuffy way. Various seating areas with both tables and large booths.  Also, a very nice fairly large bar area, which looked enticing ! Layden, our server, was at the top of the scale with his attention. Promptly there with a cheerful welcome for drink orders and menus and that delightful bread (oh so good, warm and soft). He gave us just the appropriate amount of time to review the vast, huge (too large IMO) menu before coming back to take food requests.  He was a delightful young man. (AND a very tall one at that; bet my friend he was at least 6'3"", but didn't get personal and ask Layden). When inquiring if he was a college student, he excitedly shared that he was in real estate, with an ""elite"" company. He said he was encouraged that the market was turning around, and at the end of the evening said to be sure and call if we were ever in the market for a home. Since I had instigated the conversation as to his career, didn't feel we were getting a solicitation for his business, but just part of his courteous response to our interest. I digress, back to the food now.  Preface all by mentioning that my friend had a $50 gift certificate which brought us to the Cheesecake Factory that evening. Neither of us had been here in several years, so we were looking forward to something different. He ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta; Penne with Artichokes, Broccoli, Roasted Eggplant, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Garlic, Pine Nuts & Parmesan Cheese. I ordered Pasta Carbonara with Spaghettini, Chicken, Bacon, Green Peas, in a creamy Parmesan Sauce, to which I added fresh chopped Tomatoes.  Food arrived promptly, hot and a HUGE serving. My dish was good; creamy, not too rich and not saturated with the sauce; the chicken was tender and moist pieces of white meat; I really enjoyed the addition of the fresh chopped tomatoes; a perfect blend of flavors with the bacon, peas and garlic. YUM !!! About two thirds of my entree traveled home for lunch the next day.  I tasted the friend's entree, and it was quite good as well. Loved the smoky taste of the sun dried tomatoes and roasted eggplant. He obviously liked it as well, as there was not one single tube of Penne left in the bowl. It looked like he could have licked the bowl clean.  Now, let's chat a moment about prices. We had two pasta entrees, he had two beers, and I had two Merlots. Bill arrives; friend studies it, looks up and says ""can you believe this....$61 for our dinner?"" We are both a little stunned. $61 for pasta and 2 drinks each? Yes, we realize that alcohol often eats up 1/2 of the check, but, really, at the Cheesecake Factory? The food was good; enjoyable, no complaints,  but not off the chart ""best I've ever had anywhere"".   Had this been at Bugatti's, Andiamo's, or other fine (non chain) Italian dining establishments, price would have been the norm and expected. (I've paid much more at those special spots, and worth every $)  But, at the CCF ?  Don't think so.  While we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and the food, and the service, and don't regret dining here, we both agree there are MANY other spots with comparable food and atmosphere that would be less pricey.   Yep, CCF,  we like you, but you are way overpriced for what you are.   (AND, we didn't even have any of your awesome desserts. Perhaps next time, we'll drop by for a glass of wine and some yummy cheesecake!!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=220
Robert D.,"Richardson, TX",29,57,,4.0,9/13/2014,Good restaurant.  The menu is huge and it will take you a while to figure out what to get for dinner.  I had the Chicken Bellagio which was very good bread chicken on a bed of pasta.  Also shared piece of Lemon Mirangue Cheese cake which was very good (the dinner plate is big lol).  The ambiance and decorations were also very good.  You could be casual or dress a bit nicer.  Definitely worth checking out and come prepared to eat lol.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=220
Russell F.,"Waxahachie, TX",25,196,48,4.0,7/11/2014,If you have a group that can't figure out what they want to eat bring them here. The menu is huge and has lots of choices. The food is good and the cheesecake even better. This may not be true but I think if you eat your cheesecake there you get a larger portion than if you get it to go.

My biggest qualm about this place is that everything is just so darn heavy and unhealthy - slathered in grease and butter. I know they are trying to provide a ""skinny"" menu now but not sure if even these items are that healthy...

Oscar S.,"Dallas, TX",1,8,,3.0,10/12/2008,"Cheese Cake Factory, Sunday October 12th 1pm Brunch - the Wait was about 20 minutes not too bad for a Sunday Brunch. There is complimentary Valet Parking which is great, because the mega Shopping Center is Packed with BMW, Lexus's, and SUV's. So we waited at the Bar where we were greeted by a great bar tender by the name of Patrick, Cute guy and very friendly. He did check ID's but I guess he was doing his job. We ended ordering our food at the bar. You can order from the brunch menu, lunch menu or dinner menu. I had the orange chicken which was Phenomenal.  They also have this tropical Ice tea that rocks. Patrick was professional and didn't get distracted when tacking our order when some classless bimbos yelped ""Excuse me can I get a drink"". He kept his cool, told them that he would be with them next and continued right on. I am a service man, and I give Patrick 4 Stars Out of 5. I give the food 3  1/2 Stars, and I give the atmosphere 3 stars, and my total bill with a mimosa was less than $20.

Ray F.,"Dallas, TX",80,414,160,4.0,4/15/2017,"A Friday night with a group of 7 at 7 PM at a place most of us had never been.   Me and my date got there 45 minutes early to get on the list and had a drink at the bar.  Kind of surprised for the cost, but the atmosphere was nice. As the rest showed up early, our pager went off and they had a circular booth for us which was way too small.  So back on the list we went and tried to hide in the bar to get out of everyone's way.  About 10 minutes later, we had a table. The menu and all of the additional inserts requires more than a few minutes to a new patron to read. I can only imagine how complicated the kitchen must be. The wait staff was great and got most of everything right. She brought bread and butter which with 7 hungry people, did not last long.  I ordered the mini crab cakes and a small garden salad to start.  Both were right temperature and tasty.  Timing was good.   My main course was the Americana Burger.  It was juicy, flavorful and huge!  The fries were hot and tasty.  My only complaint was the tiny container of ketchup. Seriously, I spent over $80 on a meal for 2 and they skimp on ketchup?  The wait staff brought more when I asked. The only problems from the rest of our group was a mix up on a salad being ordered and a steak not as ordered. All enjoyed their meal and experience.

Robbie D.,"Oak Lawn, Dallas, TX",724,69,280,3.0,2/13/2017,"Coming to Cheesecake Factory has always been a treat, especially after the movies or shopping at North park.  I always enjoy coming here as the the atmosphere is always inviting and of-course  fantastic cheesecake that they come to know for.  My experience on Friday evening is mixture of good and bad. I rarely ever post anything negative but rather, constructive so here it goes... As we entered the restaurant and upon visiting the host desk to add our name to the wait list, we were quoted 10 minutes. During our short wait, I casually browsed the robust cheesecake selection and made mental notes of what I'd like to order for my dessert. Our host/Hostess called our name and then sat us. As we were guided to our table, I already made assumptions on the fate of our evening which would likely be excellent based on previous visits at other notable locations . I've been to Cheesecake Factory in Oahu Hawaii, Beverly Hills California, Miami Florida and of course Texas.  As we were seated, our server arrived and greeted us. He asked to take our drink order and and checked to see if we'd like to start our evening with any appetizers. The evening were off to a good start ! After a bit of a wait, he arrived with our drinks and took our dinner order. As we relaxed and chatted, I noticed, where's our bread? and where is the coffee to my cream? All of which I asked for earlier when we first arrived and that was 15-20 minutes ago. Thankfully, the cream and the bread finally arrived but now the sweetener is missing so my coffee is now cold and flat. Unsure at this point to ask for anything else as there always seems to be a seven to ten minute delay. As I attempted to partake on the bread and butter, I encountered another issue, which was our cutlery. My knife by appearance looked unwashed and in my opinion unsanitary to placed at any table let alone an established restaurant of this caliber. I took a knife at the unseated table next to us hoping it's cleaned and polished to no avail, so the fork was the next best thing. Again, at this point not confident any requests would be well executed. Our dishes arrived, I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp  and it was just as magnificent as I recalled at other locations. The sauce was light but was big in flavor. I particularly enjoyed the subtle hints of peanuts, curry and oriental spices which accented the chicken and the shrimp nicely. Our guests receive their entrees as well and we were a happy table. From this point on it was smooth sailing. Our entrees were delicious and our drinks were kept full for the duration which is a nice reprieve from the first half of our visit.  For dessert, we indulged on the Tiramisu cheesecake which was light by cheesecake standard but big on tiramisu flavor. There were noticeable hints of cocoa, mascarpone cheese and cinnamon. I could of had two although one was perfect for sharing!  Overall assessment: clean your forks and knifes, it doesn't set a good precedent for your guests when they are about to spend 25-30$ on dinner and have dirty cutlery.  If someone ask for coffee and it's accompaniment, everything should be delivered as such and in unison. That said, the beautiful decor, consistency in the food quality and of course the cheesecake selections are all great attributes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=20

I got the Chicken Bellagio and the pasta part is a tiny bit oily, but overall it is delicious. I love the arugula and prosciutto!

Ashley M.,"Dallas, TX",179,120,44,1.0,4/14/2017,"I was here a few days ago for happy hour.  At first things were going well.  I sat down at a table by the bar. The place was fairly empty. There was a lot of wait staff just kind of hanging around conversating.      I ordered a cosmo and the Fried Chicken sliders. I was brought out the hamburger sliders. Smh. I was really irritated by this being that I literally hadn't eaten all day. I was not happy with having to wait on them to remake a dish that was put in the system incorrectly.     The waiter argued me down saying that I did not specify which sliders I wanted. But I definitely said fried chicken sliders and I pointed to it on the menu as well. But let's say, his version of the story was correct. If I did not specify which sliders I wanted, why didn't you just ask me which ones I wanted, instead of playing the guessing game?     I called a manager over and the nonchalant look on his face let me know that he didn't think a waiter arguing with me was a big deal. All he did was offer for another waiter to serve us. Even after that,  my date and I ordered another round of drinks and continued to patronize the place. My date still tipped and ordered A Slice of Cheesecake for me to go . But I could not get out of there fast enough!  My blood was boiling.  Worst service and attitudes ever.

Mary A.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,14,5,1.0,5/15/2017,"Chaos, terrible service, mediocre food. We went yesterday for Mother's Day. It was absolute chaos upon reaching their doors! I was appalled by how many people were just crammed together as soon as you opened the doors! I had anticipated a crowd and had called before asking if I could make a reservation, I was told reservations were only accepted for parties of 7 or greater. We arrived a little before 5pm. It was my husband, me, and our 2 daughters. We managed to squeeze our way towards their host station. There were several girls there huddled and frazzled. I approached them, NONE of them bothered to acknowledge me nor even make eye contact with me. I tried calling out to them above the chatter of the crowd, mind you I am standing directly in front of them. Finally one notices me, takes our name and hands us our buzzer, with a 45 minute wait.  At 6 pm our buzzer finally goes off. We squeeze through the crowd again up to the hostess. We show her our buzzer, she takes it and tells us to wait on the side...we stood there maybe another 20 minutes until finally our waiter shows us to our table. This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory. The menu had a plethora of meals to choose from so it took me a few minutes to decide. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, my husband ordered the Jambalaya, my daughters both had the kids' chicken strip meals, and we ordered the Avocado toast as an appetizer. I am so upset about my experience there that I have taken this time to explicitly describe our visit. Now, to me, this may not be a classy establishment, BUT going out to eat at any restaurant not considered a fast food joint, should take great stride and pride in presentation, preparation, and quality of their meals and service. In the food industry, especially, pleasing your customers is how your business grows and exists in the first place. I digress...so our Avocado toast arrived. For presentation, I would give it a big, fat, thumbs down. Now, we were starving, and after such a horrid wait, we were hesitant to delay eating any longer, so my husband and I both had a piece of the toast. The taste was awful. We ordered the Avocado toast, what we got was guacamole, slathered sloppily on toast. Had it been good guacamole, our hunger would have allowed us to look past that, unfortunately, it was brown and tasted awful. I eat avocados every day, so I know old avocado when I see/taste one. As hungry as I was, I refused to keep eating it. We let our waiter know and he said he would see what could be done since half the toast had been eaten! A manager came by and was hesitant to help. He offered to make us another one, a fresh one, we were still paying for it afterall. A new toast did arrive, no brown, still guacamole. We said nothing. My husband's jambalaya was okay, definitely not an authentic jambalaya but not terrible. My chicken Bellagio was mediocre. It was two halves of chicken breast with some sort of panko crust on it. The pasta underneath is was a tad bland but not awful. Now my daughters' chicken strips were BAD. I can't believe whoever cooked them even passed them along to be served. They were overcooked to say the least. The batter was burnt and had a burnt, salty taste.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake, it was good, turned out it was on the house when we got our bill. After this epic fail, I will never return to this establishment. I don't care if they'll use the holiday as an excuse. It is poor management and poor organization and service of their employees. The place was chaos! Couldn't even distinguish the line for their bakery and the line waiting to be seated, let alone those entering and leaving the restaurant.  They need a more efficient method for seating their customers and definitely an update and revision to their food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=40

I ordered curbside to go it took forever then when I got my meal they completely left the shrimp off both dishes. Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta and the SHRIMP and sausage pasta. Like really??? No shrimp on the shrimp and sausage pasta? So while I went inside to let them know, the waitress bought our second bag of food to the car. My mom realized the fries for my daughter weren't in the bag and the waitress all but accused my mom of hiding the fries to get more. She ""knew"" they were in the bag because she put hem there. Meanwhile when she came in as I was talking to the manager to get my food fixed she says oh I also left their fries out completely my fault i didn't put them in the bag. But you literally just told my mom you did. Finally got my food, three measly pieces of shrimp on each plate that are now pretty much a separate dish bc they don't have any of the dish's flavors, then the fries and then had to wait for the bread we had requested.They offered nothing for the trouble hell not even a glass of water just had me wait the 30 extra minutes and sent me on my way.

My husband and I like to come here every once in awhile to enjoy the delicious cheesecake! My favorite is the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. He enjoys the Reese's one.

Maribel J.,"Dallas, TX",6,31,4,3.0,2/1/2017,"3.5. Came here on Friday and it was the worst mistake ever! The wait time is RIDICULOUS. If you're willing to wait then this restaurant is for you. Luckily, they had the patio open with the heater lamps on so we sat outside.  Our server wasn't friendly, a bit rude in a way. No conversation at all. We still left a good tip because we're used to that. My husband ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables which turned out to be delicious. It's probably one of the best steaks I've had. My chicken pasta wasn't good compare to other times. It was so watery with no flavor. The bread they give you is good specially the brown one. Piña coladas are the best! Strawberry, banana or red velvet are my go to cheesecake. Make sure you get dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=40

As soon as the customer in front of us left, they came over to  the cashier who was helping us and started laughing. They had been making fun of the customer's backside. They went on and on about it. On top of that, we waiting for our cheesecake for about 5 minutes before realizing that it was already at the counter....it just hadn't been bagged or given to us.

Mike T.,"Addison, TX",0,29,,2.0,9/8/2016,"Cheesecake Factory used to be our family favorite place.  But the quality of food and service has gone down.  This is my experience eating here on 9/8/2016. The food:  3 of us ordered 3 entrees (fried catfish, factory meatloaf, factory burger), 1 appetizer (calamari), 1 drink (passion fruit magarita), 2 cheesecakes (red velvet, s'mores). Total cost $95 before tip.  Sort of expensive for the quality of food. The food: The drink was pathetic.  A lukewarm magarita that tastes like cough syrup and costs $11.25. The bread (pumpernickel and sourdough) was nice.  But the slices were all unevenly cut. The calamari was greasy, The presentation was poor with a wilted piece of parsley thrown on top of a tub of marinara sauce. The entrees were all right. Nothing special but the portions were large.  Enough leftover for a second meal.   The cheesecakes were good.  Presentation was poor.  One piece of cheesecake fell on its side when it was brought to the table. The service: The waitress was unfriendly.  Sloppy to say the least.  Threw stuff on the table.  Refilled water only once.  Put drinks on table without coasters or napkins.  Overall, the experience of eating there was very uncomfortable. The food and experience is not worth the cost.   I would come back if they cut the price in half. ### in response to the comment from business manager of cheesecake factory ### Hmmm.  I think many people are like me when having a bad experience with a restaurant... just end it and move on.

We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night so that's pretty normal. But since this place always seems to have a wait, it would be nice if they had a waiting area large enough to accomodate everyone who is waiting.  The hot sourdough bread was very nice to start with. We shared the French country salad. The sweet and salty combo was perfect together.  I had the Morrocan chicken. It was very good and with three chicken breasts I will have two more meals at home.

We requested to move 3 booths down and the hostess caught an attitude and flat out refused to allow us to move, claiming no other area was available even though this was a late Sunday night with a sparse crowd. Then we waited. And waited. Aaaand waited. For several minutes we waited for a server that would never appear. I would have tracked down a manager to fix all this but my headache from the noisy people led us to get the hell out of there. Which we did.  This isn't Black Eye Pea prices...it's Cheesecake Factory prices.

Also the website said dine-in only but it was offered to-go as well. If you missed it mark it down on your calendar next year July 30th. Cheesecake factory has the largest variety and best tasting cheesecake hands down. Their name says it all, it's consistently good and they never run out. You would think they would run low on some varieties especially near closing time, but they don't.   I enjoyed my cheesecake as always only wished I could have made it earlier for dinner.  If you haven't tried the Red Velvet you should it's awesome but if you need a Chocolate fix I recommend Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake, its brownies, and German chocolate all rolled into one delicious mouthful.

Bill M.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/7/2017,"Today is 3/7/17.  Notice the date of my dinner, 1/27/17.  This has been my worst experience with restaurant management ever.  I am normally not a complainer, but this experience should be heard by upper management and dealt with. I normally love the Cheesecake Factory and have taken my family there many times.  This time I ordered curbside take out for my family of five.  I got there and let them know I was ready to pick up my order.  The server said we will be out shortly with your order.  I sat there and watched two other cars who came in after me get there orders.  I sat there approximately 15 mins.  I called back inside to check on my order, and they said it was coming out.  The server was very nice and gave me the order and took my Gift Certificate that I received as a Christmas Gift inside to complete the transaction.  I looked thru the order and noticed we were missing an item.  I told the server when he came back with my receipt that there was an item missing and we went over the order.  He said, he was sorry but they only had down 1 instead of 2 of the appetizers I ordered.  I was on speaker phone with my wife when we ordered and they repeated it back to us when ordering it.  So he says that he will have to charge me for the item since it wasn't on the order.  I have been waiting for 20 mins now and my food is getting cold.  I was not happy about him charging me for their error, but I said go ahead because we needed the item.  After charging me $11.85 for the item, I waited another 10 -15 mins for it to come out.  Now the whole order, which was $70 plus dollars is cold and I have to drive another 15 minutes home.  After I got home and had a limp dinner, I decided that I would call the manager about the experience.  Gretchen, said she was sorry and asked what she could do to make it right.  I told her that I would like a refund for the $11.85 because I shouldn't have been charged for that mistake and that she could give me some kind of gift card for my bad experience.  She offered a $25 gift card that would come in the mail and she would refund my $11.85 on my credit card.  Weeks go by and I received nothing.  I call Gretchen back and she tells me that it has to go thru corporate in California and it takes about 2 weeks to process. A month goes by and I call Gretchen again and tell her I have not received either a refund or a gift card.  She says I can come to the restaurant and she can give me a $25 gift card because it is taking so long.  Now I have to go out of my way, go to the restaurant and get the gift card.  She says that the refund and original gift card are still going to come in the mail.  Now it has been 6 weeks.  I still have no gift card, and no refund.  I speak with Patrick, the General Manager, and he gives me the same story about it has to go thru corporate and he can't do anything about it.  He is not accommodating at all.  I am very frustrated and I ask him, ""if someone has a bad meal in your restaurant, or has a complaint about service, don't you as the GM have the authority to comp their meal an make it right on the spot?"" His response is, ""what do you want me to do to make it right?"" He plainly isn't going to offer anything, just put the ball back in my court. Really?!?  I told him I wanted a $50 gift certificate because I have spent 6 weeks and many phone calls and gotten 0 satisfaction for being a good customer.  He says he will mail me one or I can come to the restaurant and get it.  Again, asking me to go out of my way in order to just be reimbursed for my bad experience.  I ask him to mail it to me and he says he will that day.  Today is 1 week to the day since I talked with Patrick.  I HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING FROM CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!!  I call and ask for Patrick and get the 3rd manager I have spoken with now, Reggie, and he says Patrick is not there and he will follow up with him on it tomorrow.  He said he texted Patrick and he got a response of ""already sent it. "" Now I know I have just been lied to by management.  I doesn't take 6 weeks to get either a refund on my credit card, which could have been done on the phone with my information and a credit card machine, or to get a gift certificate mailed to me, even from California! I AM STILL WAITING....... Gretchen could have solved the issue when I called her the first time.  She should have just said, I am sorry for this mistake.  You can have the same order on the house next time you come, or I will personally send you a $75 gift certificate to cover the meal.  That's it!  Problem solved!  DON""T SAY, ""IT HAS TO GO THRU CORPORATE AND WILL TAKE 2 WEEKS!!!!!! NOBODY WANTS THAT AS A RESPONSE!!!!!!!  And then not to follow thru with it?!? Just outright lie about it. Most of the complaints I have read online have to do with poor management.  Maybe the District, Regional, or Head of Customer Relations should take a hard look at this locations' management skills and how customers are treated.

The most recent time I visited, I shared the Hot Spinach & Cheese Dip with my family and it was very good.  Piling the fresh, hot crunchy chips with the dip PLUS the salsa and sour cream was the perfect combination.   Now lately, I've been on my Weight Watchers road, so I always aim towards The Skinnylicious Menu which is AMAZING!  My favorite items, well they're all my favorite so far, are the Veggie Burger, which is seasoned perfectly like a real beef patty, the Soft Tacos which are FILLED with lots of chicken OR shrimp and The Crispy Crab Bites.  The menu is filled with so many options, never boring.  One thing to remember though, if you have a big party with you, get there early, ESPECIALLY on the weekend, because the wait can be a bit long.  Also, I know you were clearly waiting on me to mention CHEESECAKE, but not this time...I don't remember the last time I had one of their huge slices, BUT I know you can't go wrong with the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake.  From what I've hear, the BEST!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=120

Giselle B.,"Dallas, TX",80,62,30,4.0,5/21/2015,"It was good as usual today, but the bread, which I LOVE, wasn't that fresh... hope was just today and they didn't change it. My father had the Fried shrimp platter  and he loved it, very crispy and with 3 different dipping sauces. My mom had the grilled beef medallions (small plates menu) and she said it was good and eat it all (thats a lot to say), the crispy grilled veggies and match potatoes looked great, very clean and simple. I  had a beets, feta, rucula side salad which was delicious and the macaronis and cheese side, this time was not crispy and golden on top. Dulce de leche cheesecake amazing. Good experience overall today. Just one small detail I have noticed the last 2 times at this location, waitresses are too much pushing to get the order. They practically gives you the menu and two minutes later ask if you are ready, and then come back every 2 minutes to ask again making you feel very uncomfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=120

Cheesecake factory stands by their food. Gross. It looks like a good way to get food poisoning and miss 2 days of work. Nothing was even a servable temperature. I offered to send photos before throwing it all out. I should have so I could post them all over the Internet. Clearly I will never go eat at this place. My first experience for this restaurant...  it looks like the health department needs to stop by and check that kitchen out. I was really looking forward to trying this place too.

Aaron O.,"Lexington, KY",23,54,129,3.0,8/6/2015,"I came on a weekday night around 4:30pm to take advantage of Happy Hour which is only served in the bar/lounge area. My date and I were quickly seated and the server took our drink and app order in a timely manner. The app (spinach and cheese dip) was great, better to eat with the bread. However, after delivering our drinks and apps the server was rather busy with other tables and it took a while for her to get back to us.  The restaurant allows you to order some entrees in lunch portion sizes before 5pm and we almost missed ordering before 5pm because it took a while for the server to come back. It also took a while for us to get bread too although I'm not sure if you are supposed to ask for it or if it is supposed to come no matter what so that may be my fault.  Another server delivered our entrees which were huge even for a lunch sized portion. We both got pasta and I wasn't particularly impressed with my pasta. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. The garlic sauce was rather bland. My date got the cheese noodles and it too was alright.  The highlight of the meal was of course the cheesecake. We ordered the chocolate cheese cake with chocolate mouse and it was awesome.  I will definitely make a return trip as I want to try something else other than pasta..

My friend and I came here tonight in order to catch up and enjoy some dinner, and our over all experience was just weird. Our server brought our bread 3 minutes before our food came out so we couldn't even enjoy that and he seemed annoyed at the fact that we kept telling him we didn't want any cheesecake for dessert. If that wasn't enough, we were given our checks before we even finished eating dinner.

Stephen W.,"Dallas, TX",194,1228,1670,3.0,9/22/2013,"We ate lunch here on a beautiful fall day, the weather was perfect, the food not so much. What I did not like: my Pit Beef sandwich was one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had in my life. The beef was virtually inedible, fatty, tough to chew, and had no ""char"" flavor at all. The horseradish sauce was flavorless. The cheese was not melted. The total sandwich was nothing short of horrible. They need to remove this item from the menu or learn how to make it correctly. I also did not like the fact that I was upsold to the largest size beer without my knowledge. Usually, the customer is asked what size he/she wants.  What I liked: the wife's Chicken Bellagio was delicious--the chicken was moist and tender, really good flavor. The accompanying pasta with pesto was a bit oily but overall it was a good dish. As usual, the portion is enormous.  The winner of the meal was the cheesecake; we got a plain piece and it was so good that we could have made a meal of that alone.

Number one make sure you get extra rye bread idk why but it's GOOD. We also tried the buffalo chicken wontons (I think that's what they're called) they gave us a lot of them and I'm glad they did. By far the best buffalo chicken anything I've had in a while, get ranch too(ranch goes with everything FYI) For dinner I got the Cajun Pasta with extra shrimp, it was good not really a stand out meal though not worth getting.

Mystery L.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,,1.0,8/4/2016,"Let me preface by saying me and my family have been meeting at the Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years. We live in the Dallas Texas area and frequent three of the locations Frisco, Arlington, and Rt 12 / Northwest Highway in Dallas, depending if  we are coming from work, or depending Where We Are while traveling around the city. Northwest Highway Cheesecake Factory over the past seven years has consistently going downhill in the consistency and quality of food. 4:30 today my daughter and I went in to get one of our favorite dishes which is the chicken Madeira. Aside from odd attitude that was on the rude side with the waitress when we asked her for extra butter because three paths are just not enough... gave a dirty look and rolled her eyes. When we received our food the chicken was over done quite rubbery. The potatoes where as if they had been sitting since lunchtime and also tasted like the dairy that was used in it was sour/went bad.. The Madeira gravy was extra peppery. At no time did our waitress come over to ask us how our meal was. Aside from the bad food we had to combat against a plethora of fruit flies that were trying to attack our food  one of which got into my daughter's gravy boat. My daughter got up & spoke to the general manager named Pat or Patrick who she explained all the issues at no time did he show empathy or apologized. He only offered to get us new mashed potatoes and gravy. When he came over to the table we showed him the fruit flies. Still no empathy, no let me remake your food because the whole dish was a disaster. He just completely disregarded  the horrific  quality of service and food  we received as if it was acceptable . OK in the meanwhile I called up the corporate number, took a picture of our receipt, the varioud flies we caught and s picture of the underside of the   show all the food and filth / crime that was stuck  underneath the table. While on the phone leaving a voicemail with corporate since they close at 4 p.m. suffice as to say... if you want a good experience with Cheesecake Factory the Frisco location by far is more consistent, they're serving portions are generally decent and the quality and professionalism is important to the staff.  As one more side note we were at the same location last week and had the same meal. They ran out of mashed potatoes and this time they were soupy and gave us barely half cup portion of potatoes and served it to us knowing full well they ran out of mashed potatoes.

Kevin G.,"Dallas, TX",94,112,16,1.0,6/14/2013,"We hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, but tonight we needed a place that had dessert and was open late. My wife and I took my Mom to dinner, and after we dropped her at home, we both realized we wanted something sweet. The only problem was that it was 10pm, so a lot of places would be closed or closing. Someone mentioned Cheesecake Factory, the Maps app on my phone said they were open until after midnight, so off we went. No wait on arrival, which was good. Asked for a table, no problem. Found the desserts on page 467 of the menu, good to go. So far, the only issue is they don't have pie. No pie? The waiter shows up, gets a drink order, starts going through specials, and my wife says, ""I think we're just having dessert."" He wanders off to get the drinks. Behind me, I hear an angry female voice whisper, ""They're just having dessert?"" This made me feel uncomfortable, since I don't like strangers angry at me, but out of the corner of my eye, I noticed she was carrying a tray with two whole pieces of bread, so she was probably just overworked. I hope she found a more worthy table to receive her bread. We ordered ""just dessert"" (our just desserts?) Next, our drinks arrived. Out of the corner of my other eye, I noticed something on the end of the table. Our check. Drinks, check, food.  Has the serving order changed? I ordered alcohol, and I'm not a small person, and many people can tell I'm Irish - wouldn't you leave that tab open? It's interesting how a piece of paper in a plastic sheath can ruin an otherwise fine piece of chocolate cake. ""Fine"" as in tasty, large and slightly over-priced. So, I see no need to go back. If you get he bum's rush out of a place for just ordering dessert when the name of the place contains ""cheesecake"", I don't need to visit any longer. Ironically, it took forever for the waiter to notice my credit card so we could pay and make room for real customers. If you want to be known for desserts, perhaps you should warn staff that some customers will come in to order it. The last time I received a check before my order was in a New York diner after midnight. We got my food, the check and then my wife's food. So, that was slightly better than tonight.

Service was average at best.   The food was not good.  Fiance's crispy beef was an exception to that.  I forgot why I stopped going to the Cheesecake Factory to begin with, and now I remember why.  Paying $17 for an entire box of spaghetti and 2 pounded-flat chicken breasts is ridiculous.  No one needs an entire box of spaghetti on their plate.  Rather, why don't you put some veggies or something else of actual substance on it?  Pasta costs 99 cents to make, two chicken breasts set you back about $5... so why does this cost $17? Pasta was exceptionally salty (found out from his mom afterward that hers was the same), but the worst was glancing down at my plate and seeing a lovely dark hair beneath one of the chicken breasts.  If you can't wear hair nets, I really don't want to know what else you are not doing when preparing my food.   We won't be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=200

We waited forever for to-go boxes and the only time our server was attentive is when it was time for us to pay. What a shock.  the food was good.

Paul H.,"San Antonio, TX",9,21,12,3.0,2/7/2016,"Saturday, a busy day for this location, that not withstanding it took them over two hours to seat us (a group of nine).  Obligatory bread and butter soon appear, warm bread real butter, very good.  Drinks/appetizers ordered and arrive in reasonable time.  Entrees ordered and arrive in like fashion with the exception of one entree that was ""sent to the wrong table"".  Food presentation was over the top, every entree served drew attention with the occasional oohs and aahs.  I had the grilled fish tacos with black beans and rice.  Tacos were adequate but overstuffed with what was supposed to be marinated onion but seemed to be more like a cole slaw.  They must have been rationing the fish because there was too much filler and not enough fish.  I gotta give our waiter credit, he did pretty good, and gave us separate checks without batting an eyelash.  He was tipped accordingly well.  Overall it was adequate, I would go back maybe at a time when it's a little less busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=200

They took us over to the bar area to sit right next to large family. We were not wanting to have a nice lunch sitting in someone's lap so asked for a booth and only had to wait another few minutes for that, so that was nice.  Once seated our waitress was super friendly and took our drink orders. They have special teas which we opted for, it was strawberry and soooo good. They even put sugar on the rim of the glass. We ordered the avocado fries which came with a nice spicy dipping sauce. Our app came out with our meal which stinks a  little because Iike to snack and you can't do that when you have a massive meal in front of you. I ordered a chicken dish that I can't recall the name of, and my husband ordered a steak dish. I wish I would have ordered the steak because it was amazing, it was medium rare and cooked to perfection. Even his mashed  potatoes were perfect. All in all I got the wrong meal, mine wasn't bad it just wasn't steak.  We ordered the red velvet  cheesecake. It was pretty tasty, I don't know why I was expecting to be awed, wowed, left speechless by cheesecake, but it didn't happen. Good but not slap yo momma good.

Johnathan D.,"Dallas, TX",4,7,,3.0,10/8/2015,"I took my wife to this location for our 3rdyear anniversary. I called several hours in advance to book a table for two. I specifically asked for a table no where near a bathroom, the kitchen or where there would be foot traffic (like waiters next to a kios). They were very nice over the phone and said no problem we'll take care of it. We arrived at 5:30 and I had forgotten at how refreshing it was in The Cheesecake Factory. It had been probably 10 years since I had been there last. We were seated in the far back next to a giant wall with a great view of the restaurant. I felt really good about the table until only a minute after we sat down we heard pans being dropped on the floor, plates clinking together and orders being yelled loudly. We had been seated only feet away from the kitchen. There were no doors between where people sit and where the kitchen is. The only thing between us was a wall but on both ends of the wall there was a huge area where waiters were walking back n forth and our table was right next to it. I tried to ignore it but after trying to have a conversation with my wife more pans were being dropped in the kitchen and it was so loud I couldn't even carry on a conversation without thinking (what is going on back there?) and my wife agreed. I asked my waiter Michael if we could sit somewhere else. He completely agreed with me that it was so loud and he gave me the option of where I would like to sit. I chose a booth far away from the kitchen and it ended up being a perfect spot. We ordered mixed drinks, some kind of marinated steak (My wife chose it so I forget the name) and their popular fresh strawberry cheesecake which was excellent. I ordered the pineapple Moscow Mule which was an interesting twist on the original Moscow Mule and my wife ordered a drink (forget what it was) but it had rum in it and it was absolutely awful, at least for me. It was pure alcohol with a splash of food coloring (from the taste of it) or something. It had no taste to it except the alcohol. I am not one to complain about an extra shot or two from the bar tender but at $10 a glass and it being a fruit drink it should have a nice flavor to it instead of every time you drink its like taking a straight shot of rum. My wife did order a second one but she agreed with me it was too strong to be a mix drink. We ended up having a great time at the end. The initial bump with giving us a table right next to the kitchen even when I specifically asked not to be took 2 stars away. It is just unacceptable. In fact, they really need to put doors there instead of leaving these giant gaps open. Those kitchens can get so loud I don't see how anyone can enjoy a conversation over a meal sitting at those tables only feet away from the kitchen. Michael was a great waiter. It wasn't his fault we were seated there. What was even more odd was that the restaurant was probably 80% empty because we got there early before the dinner rush and we were still seated at probably the worst table in the entire restaurant. That's what I don't understand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=200

Neal S.,"Houston, TX",40,54,6,1.0,8/6/2014,Really bad service.  We walked in for a party of 6 and requested the large booth. They said yes but when we went to the booth it was uncleared and dirty. So they said they would clean it up. I said I will be right outside for a smoke and be right back. They said fine. Now one of the party members has a child that does not like to be touched so we had to be specific. No more than 90 seconds I come back and they said oh you are back. I gave the table to someone who was wearing the same shirt as you. How stupid is that. Then the manager doesn't even offer anything in return until I had said you mistakenly gave away my table and and try to sit me at a 5 person table. That is horrible. Keep in mind this dinner was for a big dinner meeting with clients and being squished together wasn't going to work. I got upset and said this is insane that is all you can do.

Know that a slice of cheesecake no matter what flavor is around 1,000 or more calories X_X Their entrees and appetizers are really good also! I didn't like their cream cheese wontons so much. Their orange chicken isn't special either but so many of their items are really good. Even though some items can be pricey($23) they're huge and can easily be shared by 2 people.

Praveen V.,"Dallas, TX",74,136,27,4.0,12/5/2010,"I am generally not a huge fan of large chain restaurants. But Cheesecake Factory is different. No matter when we go and where we go, one thing is for sure - Consistency. Their food, deserts, and drinks are always great!  We went to Cheesecake Factory last night for dinner with a couple of friends. The place was jam packed as it always is. Cheesecake Factory is a big melting pot of people from various cultures and backgrounds all in one spot. I am not surprised of that since their menu caters to everyone's taste buds. You are sure to find everything from Burgers & Fries to Jamaican to Cajun to Asian to American. Wait, American is burgers & fries :)  I remember the very first time I went to Cheesecake Factory 10 yrs ago and I was just amazed at the sheer size of their menu. The fancy advertisements of high end cars, clothing, etc were always eye catchy, but seems like they have come a long way from that now. Given that they keep adding new items to their menu every year, they have reduced the real estate dedicated to advertisements significantly and focused the space on their top selling items.  Bang Bang Chicken has been on their menu for years but is now called Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta also has been there forever. Last night though, I decided to try their Salmon with Spinach and Mushrooms with Angel Hair pasta. I would not order it again as it was nothing special and was also a bit bland for my taste buds. However, the slice of Peanut Butter Reese's Pieces Cheesecake was worth the visit at the end.  Overall I rate Cheesecake Factory 4 stars for being a great neutral place as it offers variety of choices and serves good food everytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=280
Cameron H.,"Dallas, TX",12,16,12,4.0,2/22/2011,"The first thing of note about the Cheesecake Factory: the portions are huge. I like this. I feel okay paying $16 for an entree when I'm able to take home over 50% for leftovers. My favorite dish is the Crusted Chicken Romano. They always get the cheesy ""crisp"" on the chicken perfect. The free warm bread (sourdough and wheat) and butter are incredibly good. I think that it's great that a restaurant named after a dessert makes really good desserts. The Dulce de Leche Caramel cheesecake and fresh strawberry cheesecake are my favorites. After all the bread and main course goodness, I absolutely must either split the piece of cheesecake with someone or take half home. The slices are generous and come with lots of whipped cream. Free valet is great, because parking is tight. Curbside pickup is available and I'd recommend it if you don't want to wait forever for a table (ask them to include your free bread!). At most dinner times, you'd be better off calling in a to-go order, poking around Barnes and Noble for 15-20 minutes, and taking your food home - you'd be eating your meal long before dining in.

I have nothing negative to say about the place. The menu is huge and all the items unique, so I think that's why most people just stick with the same thing all the time. I love the sweet corn tamale cakes (appetizer), they come topped with onion, tomato, avocado, and sour cream. So delicious..I also ordered the soup of the day which just happened to match--mexican chicken. Lots of pieces of vegetable which did not seem canned or frozen to me, quite enjoyable.

Sean H.,"Dallas, TX",127,167,8,1.0,12/18/2009,"This was my third time to this location, and every other time I've promised myself never to return. I hope I keep my promise to myself this time. The food is less than mediocre, it is overpriced, and the waitstaff is overworked. The only redeeming factor is its cheesecake. Maybe it should stick to its name and only make cheesecakes and quit pretending to be a restaurant. My cousin and I arrived around 8:30pm for dinner, no reservation, and it's about a 30 min wait. That seems reasonable for a Friday night. I get the buzzer and we wait around 30 minutes until it buzzes. I take the buzzer up to the hostess, where she asks us to stand to the side a bit and wait to be seated, and we stand there for another 10 minutes waiting to be seated. If you're not ready to seat us, please don't buzz us. I had to ask what the continued wait was for, and then they finally seated us. Our waitress maintained a freneticism throughout the night that clearly was not her fault. She was clearly overworked, and for that I blame management. That being said, I think she was as attentive as she possibly could have been. Kudos. Anyways, we ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps as a starter, and we both get pasta dishes. When the lettuce wraps arrive, the bibb lettuce leaves that they gave us had holes all over them from pests (bugs, worms, or otherwise). Not the most appetizing thing to look at, but fine I can ignore it since it's not going to kill me. We wait a while for our pasta dishes, but then a waitress (not ours) comes by and tells my cousin that they had accidentally served his pasta to a different table and they would need to make a new one for him, so it'd be another 6-8 minutes. Mine, however, was already done, so they asked me if they should go ahead and bring it out or keep it under a warming lamp. This is what you call a lose-lose situation. My preference, of course, would be to have my pasta come out the same time as my cousin's, but this would mean it goes under a heat lamp for 6-8 minutes, and I already know how the pasta will do under those conditions. I would have liked them to make me a new pasta dish so that we both have fresh dishes at the same time. But that would mean they'd probably throw away my original dish, and I personally hate wasting food. So I opt for the 6-8 minute heat lamp tan. They attempt to ""make it right"" by giving us each a complimentary salad. Fine, we say (but my thought was, ""as long as it doesn't have holes in it""). So both our pastas eventually come out, and my penne pasta has of course dried out, and it's just not very good. Even if it hadn't sat under a heat lamp, though, it came across as something I could have easily made at home, and made it tastier. Finally, we get to dessert. Both are very good, but our waitress forgot to give us new utensils for the dessert. So, I ended up taking my dinner fork, running it through my napkin a couple times, and using that. sigh. I have no idea why this place even has a wait; it doesn't deserve that sort of patronage. It is overpriced undertasting food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=280

Spicy Ahi Tempura was my favorite thing on the menu until today. I ordered the Buffalo Blasts. They are like little buffalo chicken wontons and you get a ton of them for $9.50. I'm eating Round 2 of my leftovers right now and even shared 2 of them with my friends. Their new items are a hit with me. I can't find the name of my favorite one but it's just like a very good General Tso's chicken. I usually order one of the following: Greek salad Stuffed Dates Avacado Egg Rolls or the Crab Sandwich (Mmmm) but stay away from their nachos especially if you get them with chicken. I threw that in the trash and kissed my $12 goodbye on that one. We had red velvet cheesecake today. I can't stand red velvet cake but I sucked this thing down, at least my portion of it.  The service is always pretty good but sometimes it's too good. We only go for lunch and the staff treats your ""dining experience"" like you're on vacation. That's all well and good but not when you have an hour for lunch and don't have time for some leisurely 10 minute recitation of the specials. It took 15 minutes to get 1 piece of cheesecake to us.  It had a candle and some words in icing on the plate but that doesn't take 15 minutes unless you have to look up the spelling of Happy Birthday To You in the dictionary.

Dave F.,"Irving, TX",2823,163,37,4.0,2/28/2010,"On a chain restaurants scale, this one is above average in quality, presentation, and ambiance. If I'm uneasy about anything, there's something artificial about the place. It feels like a New Vegas themed restaurant, where the restaurant is attempting to be classy while lacking real authenticity. It doesn't matter what kind of food you're into, the menu has enough variables on Americana you'll find something worth trying. Multiple pages of mind-boggling selection. I wonder why so many items? The food itself is good. I'd say some of the best for a chain. But here lies the authenticity question; the food lacks personality and flavor. It looks much better than it actually tastes in my humble opinion. My impression is the diners at Cheesecake fall for the superficial glitz of the place (setting and presentation), and fail to question the flavor of the food itself.  It's kind of boring to me. The place is an obvious local favorite, always packed, great location. And I think it deserves more than three stars for the overall execution of the operation.

Nick S.,"Dallas, TX",144,85,1,4.0,6/24/2008,"It is possible to have too much of a good thing.   Case and point, Cheesecake Factory. I get it -- you guys can make any kind of food and then serve it in portions big enough to feed small Eastern European villages.  Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD.   When I was in college in Boston, going to this place was a treat.  I was poor and it meant that somebody's parents were in town.  At one point, there was nothing more exciting than catching the green line from Fenway Park to Copley Station, trekking across a cold, snowy night to the intersection of Boylston and Massachusetts Ave. to the Prudential Center Mall, where you would find the warm, welcoming glow of the Cheescake Factory.  There, you would meet a set of parents intent on stuffing your thinning frame with more food than you've had in the past thirty six hours -- all in one sitting.   But once I moved to Dallas and proceeded to take every single thing in my life for granted, I began to despise their overly large menu and fatty portions.   I tend to lean toward a restaurant that has sensibly filling portions and a menu that guides me through a culinary experience rather than shotgun blasts me with fusion after fusion of cuisine from around the world that have been forced together for the sake of novelty.   Like the Southwestern Egg Rolls.  Gimme a break. But I'm just reaching at this point.  Let's face it, Cheesecake Factory is a good restaurant.  I know most people probably love the huge portions and big selection, but as for me, I try and avoid the place if I can help it, if only for the sake of my waistline. Bottom Line: This place is a Friday's on steroids, but the food is actually good.  Order one appetizer and one entree for your table of four.  Not kidding.  Also -- try to come for brunch.  Four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dallas?start=300

The quality of the food here, the same dishes I've eaten at the Southlake Cheesecake factory, are poor by comparison.

I can't begin to remember everything that was ordered on this lunch excersion with my office as the table was much more spreadout this time and I couldn't even see what was going on at the other end.   I will note that the biggest complaint was the TEA issue.  They had Sweet Tea and Unsweet Mango Tea.  But is there any unsweet non-fruit tea to be had at a Cheesecake Factory?  Not, unless you want Green Tea there isn't.  This just doesn't seem like a smart idea to me. As appetizers, we had the Guacamole Made-To-Order and The Factory Appetizer Favorites Combo Platter which had a Combination including: Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach and Cheese Dip, Pot Stickers, Summer Rolls, Quesadilla, Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts and Calamari. The meals that I can remember landing at our table were: Tomato Mozzarella Salad, Soup and Salad. Crispy Chicken Costoletta (x3), Crab Cake Sandwich, Teriyaki Chicken, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (x2), Miso Salmon, and some tomato-based pasta dish that was on the far end of the table I couldn't really see.  Everyone seemed to really love their meal and especially the three that ordered the Chicken Costolettea... when they realized there was enough food there for not only that meal, but a to go box enough for lunch for two more days. I had the Crab Cake Sandwich.  It was awright.  The crab cake was a little mushy to be sandwich worthy, although.. it did have a good flavor.

You want a salad? go to Soup or Salad. I go to these places to eat what they can create. That's just me. I had the Macaroni Cheese Balls and let me tell that they were worth it. My gosh. My son had their pepperoni pizza and it was just fine. The tea was watered down. I hate that. My wife had the Romano crusted chicken that came with what looked like plain spaghetti in an oragne sauce, not amazing but ok. I had the 4 cheese penne pasta with chicken. It was good and the sauce resembled a vodka sauce and it was  great. For dessert we shared the pineapple upside down cheese cake which was of course delish.

This place makes that dream come true while hitting each food group out of the park. Their fresh guacamole made-to-order is SO AMAZINGLY GOOD, and my favorite pasta of theirs is the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. I always order a side of alfredo sauce to drench this already cheesy pasta in even more cheese, and it is absolute heaven! The portions are big and you can easily split the appetizers and entrees. Other small plates/apps of mention are the fried macaroni and cheese (so addictive) and the sweet corn fritters (yum!). And of course, if you can fit it in your stomach afterwards... the cheesecake.
