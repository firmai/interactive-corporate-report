Alana P.,"Bloomfield, NJ",12,97,326,5.0,11/11/2017,"Yea so it's Veterans Day, served in the US Marines..so Friday's posted a free meals message to veterans on their Twitter. So I called the West Orange location to inquire on the meals. I also called the Clifton location: Day and night experience.  First off, the West Orange location's employee was perhaps new, but no excuse for not knowing about the meals. The employee over at Clifton was on-point. I wanted the meal to go, and she said although it was dine-in from what she can recall, she still recommended the manager.  Spoke to the manager..didn't get her name, but she made it happen, where I was able to pick up the salad. When I went to the location to pick the food up, she even came out, thanked me for my service to the country, and gave me a neat little card for $5 off for my next visit. Turns out she is the General Manager, AND she reminded me alot of Lisa Marie Presley (hottie).  Outstanding customer service is everything. I frequent that area a great deal, because Im always at Willowbrook Mall shopping. They just gained my business based on their service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Jay M.,"Wayne, NJ",0,22,,3.0,8/30/2017,"Nothing special. Stopped here a couple months ago for the double endless apps. It is about what you would expect from a chain decent ""bar plates"" at a cheap price. The appetizers are slightly better tasking and more fresh than the Friday's apps from the frozen food section at the supermarket. Overall a good value to stuff yourself with cheap decent food. I wouldn't eat here other than when they have endless apps though. Nothing but frozen food from a microwave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Sara F.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,3,1,1.0,11/14/2017,"I would love to give a negative review of the experience I encountered at the location in Wayne, NJ. The residents at the nursing home where I work get a very small stipend every month. They went on a lunch trip recently and was overcharged for a bunch of items they did not order. When I called to point put the errors, I was contacted by a representative of the company who said a refund could not be provided but a gift certificate might be given. I emailed the receipts with detailed notes and never heard back. When I contacted them again, I was told that $40 in gift certificates was emailed to me. I never received anything. I was told to check my spam folder but anything spam gets filtered and I get notified if I want to unjunk it. When I replied again, I requested they be sent to an alternate email address that wouldn't filter out emails as strictly. Not surprisingly, I received nothing! This costs me over $30 of my own money so the senior citizens didn't lose out. It's shameful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Stephanie G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",273,404,491,1.0,1/1/2016,"So if the benches in the waiting area are full, that's a good sign, right? Of course when you sit down yourself and peer in the dining area and see nothing but empty tables, one would have questions and annoyance. We asked what the deal was, and they said a few servers called out. That is just bad managerial running and service is never exceptional to start with at this chain, so we could imagine the service if we did get seated. Instead, we went to one Cheescake Factory that was full of customers and servers and our business. I'm just not one to patronize an establishment that was entire empty sections and lots of people waiting to be seated. Something was up here and it was not a good idea to stick around longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Bevin M.,"Cranford, NJ",71,30,3,2.0,4/3/2016,"My boyfriend and I went to this location today. We got there before another couple we were meeting. We sat right away as they were not busy. The waitress came over and took our drink orders. At first we said we would wait for the other couple to order food. The other couple took longer than expected. So we decided to order an app while we waited but had to flag down the waitress as she never came back to refill sodas or check on us. The sesame jack strips came out and they were fine.  The other couple came and we all ordered. I ordered a burger medium as did my boyfriend. The food came out fast and when I cut mine open it was very well done. We also had no silverware. When the waitress came back I asked her to take it back. She asked if I was sure as another party came in and it would take a long time. Now they messed up and not our fault but was told it would take long. I told her to just take it back and take it off the bill. She asked if I was sure, but now I'm annoyed so I said yes I was sure. So I did not get anything and left hungry.  My boyfriends came out rubbery and also over cooked but he ate half. Clearly the burgers are now frozen patties. She never came back again for a while and no manager came to check in. She clearly told no one there was a problem. I asked for the manager.  The manager came over and took both burgers off the bill. This is why the 2 stars. She did the right thing and apologized for the terrible service. She then gave us free app cards for next time. I am very disappointed in how Friday's has gone downhill. I worked at one in college and it was not like this. We will not be going back to a Friday's for a long time, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Lindsay H.,"Wayne, NJ",1,20,12,1.0,7/15/2016,"If there was a zero star option, I'd give it. I visited here on a Friday night and was extremely disappointed. I came here with my boyfriend and another couple. We waited 15 minutes just for the server to come. When we ordered drinks we put in an appetizer order. 25 minutes later, our drinks came, but no appetizer. 15 more minutes go by and we get out food, not as requested. I frequently visit here, but I will not be returning to this Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Dr. F.,"Pompton Plains, NJ",1,1,1,1.0,1/19/2016,"The food isn't great and the service is good most of the time but the only reason I kept going was endless apps. Now endless apps are gone and the meal that I had was terrible I don't think I'm going back anytime soon. There point system is sorta useful but last meal they used 120 points on a $4.99 meal when 80 points could've been used for a $9.99 meal. Our waiter was helpful and got the manger to help right away but the manager was no help! She said she couldn't fix it while clearly she could have given us back the points or the cash. She walked away and didn't help at all I am not returning, for a while or at least until endless apps are back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Shaquiria M.,"Paterson, NJ",1,3,,5.0,10/16/2016,My experience at TGIFridays was amazing. The waiter was very kind and generous. He moved quickly and constantly made sure we were satisfied with our decisions. The food and drinks were delicious. I highly recommend TGIFridays in Wayne!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Michele D.,"Wayne, NJ",442,255,1081,4.0,9/8/2015,Been coming here a lot lately solely because they email me a ton of coupons that I can't pass up. Who doesn't love a discounted dinner? We usually sit in the bar area so we came watch one of the many games on their tv's. Big fan of the jack Daniels menu. They sometimes run a promo for all you can eat apps for $12/person which is a great deal. Service has always been good and restaurant is clean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Eugene O.,"New York, NY",405,428,1582,3.0,3/5/2013,"don't sit near the windows during sunsets, it becomes so blinding that it's impossible to sit, even when they bring down the shades. If you going to get the ribs, steer away from the jack daniels and get the regular baby back, they are much better and more flavourful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
John D.,"Newark, NJ",0,105,2,4.0,12/19/2015,"I haven't been to TGI Friday's in like 10 years but I went here with my mom after some shopping at her behest. Try the ribs, I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the Jack Daniel's ribs and I found them a little too sweet but still they were smokey and the meat was falling off the bone.  And that was just an appetizer portion.  I should have skipped the burger and ordered a full-rack.  The Jack Daniel's burger I had was nothing special. I will be returning just for the ribs because I was really impressed. I like the interior of the restaurant and the ambiance.  Overall, it was a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Beth S.,"Pompton Lakes, NJ",0,1,,5.0,1/10/2016,"My husband and I stopped in TGI Fridays after some shopping. I wasn't expecting much. It was very hot and noisy inside. However, the rotisserie chicken salad sandwich was delicious as was my husband's burger. We received friendly service from Adam and the rest of the staff was very pleasant and helpful. There was a flash rainstorm which caused the door to the restaurant to jam and then to flood the vestible. Several employees ran to the door to help the customer to get out and then they stayed to cleanup the mess. What a great staff! I'm impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Chris L.,"Paterson, NJ",93,998,737,3.0,2/21/2013,"No one has reviewed this place this year!!!!! And I came here with my gf and her little bro on a Sunday after shopping at the mall and DSW nearby.  We tried dining at the olive garden next door but since it was Sunday and they treat you like family there was a 2 hour wait for a table. Friday's do serve fatty fettuccine too (Cajun chicken and shrimp). So, we ate there.  We eat got the pick 2 deal shared the spicy beef cheese dip, the flatbread and the artichoke dip. They both go the fatty pasta and I got a burger. Overall, the food was on par to other dine in franchises. The turnaround was good the beer is over-priced.  The staff was really busy because of Sunday dinner crowd. There wasn't enough cleaned utensils. Ketchup bottle was not filled. My second beer (bottle) took more than 10 minutes to arrive. I's still come back but maybe on a not so busy night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Rbm M.,"Caldwell, NJ",0,3,,1.0,7/22/2016,"Last night we dined outside and were the only table seated outside. There was no problem with timing of the food brought to our table, nor did we wait a long time for service.  However, we had two issues. the rolls on all three sandwiches were very stale and one of the burgers was completely rare/raw.  Also, we asked the waiter if there were any drink and food specials or happy hour deals when he approached us to take our drink order.   He explained there are only specials at the bar and there were no specials available to us.  I ordered a sam adams summer ale and when he asked what size I would like, I asked him what sizes were available and how much each size cost. He explained ""the small was about 16 oz, the large was about 24 oz and that the large is about 2$ more than the small.""  I ordered the small.  We then ordered wings, and pretzel/dip as appys, and then our main dishes.  When our check arrived I was surprised that the small beer was $7.19.  I asked the waiter to double check the price because I couldn't believe a small beer was 7.19.  He sent the manager to our table and she said ""I heard you had a problem with your check?"" I explained that I didnt have a problem but was surprised that the small beer was 7.19 and I wanted him to double check the price.  She said the large beer is on special and that the small is actually more expensive than the large.  I explained that our waiter said there weren't any food/drink specials available to us and she apologized over and over again and said she would subtract $2.00 from our bill.   I thought this was unprofessional and had we know what the specials were, we would have ordered differently.   To make matters worse, this morning when I signed on to write this message, I noticed that there were a number of main dish 10$ specials and 5$ summer drink specials on an entirely different menu.  This problem would not have occurred if there were prices posted on the menus.  Especially special menus such as your summer menu)  There are three other restaurants in the same complex with outdoor seating(Cheesecake Factory, Bahama Breeze, and Brio) and they all have all of the prices published on all of their menus.   My three sandwiches, two appys and one small beer ended up costing me 75$. Wow, I certainly do not feel that was not money well spent!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Evelyn A.,"Haledon, NJ",0,2,,5.0,12/21/2015,"The service was good and the food was better than expected. What I really appreciated was their kindness and the ability to easily solve the problem I had. After eating my meal, I ordered another meal to go. I received my bill and received part of my order, without realizing I left without receiving the other half of my order. Completely my fault for not waiting (they weren't even taking long for what my order was) I left without my full order. When I got home I realized what happened. I immediately called and one of the managers already knew the order I was talking about. She kindly told me not to worry, that I can just pick it up. I wasn't able to pick it up that night, they allowed me to just pick it up whenever I had the chance which so happened to be the next day. The manager I talked to informed the other managers and it was easily resolved. I didn't have any problems at all and I really appreciated it since it was my silly mistake. I would definitely recommend this particular TGIFridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3
Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1732,1527,245,3.0,10/9/2012,Went here for drinks since I was in the area. Service was good. Friday's has pretty good food based on other ones I have been to.

Sasha M.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",12,157,,5.0,4/13/2009,"I would suggest joining the stripes club available on their website if you frequent this place or even occassionally go.  The last half a dozen times I went I was able to use at least one coupon.  Sometimes two.  You can get free apps, free entrees, and free desserts, which comes in handy these days.  I still believe this place has the best apps not necessarily the entrees.  They also have great service every time we go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3?start=20
Greg G.,"Hackensack, NJ",114,76,81,4.0,9/20/2009,"I don't normally leave reviews for chain restaurants but my experience at this Friday's was a pretty good one so I decided to share. It was a Friday night when I went there and surprisingly we were able to sit right away. The food was like any other Friday's but the service and management staff was awesome. Being in sales, I understand how important it is to deliver the best possible service that you can - ""service sells"". I am a huge fan of the Jack Daniels sauce that they have at Fridays and they used to have Jack Daniels wings as a entree. They recently took it off the menu, however I asked the waitress if they could make them for me and they did with no problem. Even though they are not supposed to sit you until your entire party is there, I got there early and they sat me anyway just so I wouldn't loose my spot. The waitress we had was perfect, I wish I remembered her name so I could drop her a personal shout on Yelp. Keep in mind that it is still TGIFridays, the music was really loud from the bar. You could here it from anywhere in the place. I was with my Grandmother and mother so it was alittle difficult to hold a conversation yelling back and forth. It would be a great place to go with a bunch of friends, especially in the bar. It is huge with TVs all over the place. This place is on my good list because of the excellent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne-3?start=20
