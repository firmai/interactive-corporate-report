Rude. Rude. Rude. (I normally don't name drop, but in this instance I have to) when she finally brought out the drinks, my sisters drink didn't have a straw... She asked for one, and was clearly ignored. We set a timer and had to ask a second time for the straw... When she finally brought the straw she brought an unwrapped straw and tossed it.

232,Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",599,1593,658.0,3.0,2012-06-13,"I've been coming here for a couple of years now. They are known for their pizza and their pizookies (pizza + cookie... actually its just a baked cookie in a pan with vanilla ice cream on top). Also they have a happy hour which is good, with $5 mini pizzas, good priced appetizers and drinks. While the pizza has been consistent in the past few times I've been here... the pizza I had just wasn't the same. The dough really makes BJ's a distinctive name in sit down pizza chains lol. While it was still a thick crust... it wasn't as soft and buttery as it used to be. Whatever.  Oh! We also got a ahi tuna salad last time I was here. It was good with the vinagrette and the nice amount of tuna slices around. It was big enough to share between 3 people with a good portion. Got a red velvet pizookie which has come to be my favorite. The other flavors are good as well (chocochip, white macadamia, oreo, just to name a few). For a regular size it was good to share between 3 people as well. On your birthday, you get a free pizookie! But again with these apparent changes... where the pizza lost its quality to me, the birthday pizookie has lost its quantity by being a mini size instead of the regular size. Whatever. As for other food, they have a wide variety but from what I have tried, it's nothing amazing. Just regular American fare. They do have a light menu, which looks appetizing but I never actually order anything from there due to my true fatassery...  As for the restaurant it is a very casual American bar like setting. Dim lights, American art everywhere, a big bar and multiple TVs around the restaurant. Service was good, always checking up on us. During the day, this place is pretty chill but by dinner time it could be crowded... I suggest calling in to get a table before your arrival. This is a good place overall, considering the variety of restaurants in the area (which really isn't saying much hahahahaha).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=220,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.2120000000000006,3.2000000000000006

Okay, more than a few because there were around 25 of us. BJ's staff was extremely accommodating by allowing us to have that many people in addition to offering split checks. I don't know about you, but I've noticed that a few places abhor you if you ask to split checks, especially with a large group! They include 17% gratuity for parties greater than 6, but that's only a little more than the usual 15% that you normally tip, and they deserved it after treating us so well and being so attentive. As for the food, it was good, but nothing too memorable. We shared pizzas (white and Mediterranean) which were both tasty and filling. However, the pizookies is where it is at! We shared two smalls among four people, and that was more than enough! A few friends also got a plate of three mini pizookies, which was an awesome idea. So, good (service and dessert).

283,Jenny C.,"Redlands, CA",0,7,,2.0,2012-10-28,"The two stars are only for one thing: the red velvet Pizookie. Everything else, especially the service, need serious improvement. We come here about a couple times a month because the food is pretty awesome, the Pizookies are to die for, and my husband loves the Abby Normal seasonal beer that is sometimes available in a bottle by request in the off season (I believe it is a spring time seasonal beer) Anyway, there has only been one or two visits that we have had decent service. Every other time, it has SUCKED. We came one Sunday afternoon at 2 pm for my birthday. We called ahead the day before to let them know we wanted to have a party of about 10-12 people the next day. They assured us that it would be no problem, especially in the mid afternoon, not peak lunch/dinner times. Unfortunately, that was not the case. We spent a total of 4 hours there and maybe saw our waiters (I'm not even sure how many we had, we ended up just flagging down whoever was close by when we needed something, that's how bad it was) about 3 times. People in our party arrived all within a 15 minute window, but no one's drink was brought until our appetizers arrived, and we were all thirsty. I can't believe that with all the people ""serving"" us no one could get waters for anyone. It's not hard. I can understand beers or mixed drinks taking a bit at the bar, but water? Come on. Entrees were arriving sporadically, even though we all ordered at the same time. Some were finished eating completely before others even got their meals. Nothing was complicated, just basic pizzas off the menu and a few burgers. It was absurd how little attention was paid to us and how long we were there. My husband complained to the main waitress that was serving us after asking her for the third time for a water refill and she said ""OK, but we are all doing our best here to serve you, please be patient."" Ok lady, we have been pretty patient, considering I was ready to get up and leave after the 30 minute wait for appetizers and drinks. We don't have all day to spend waiting for lunch/dinner, be reasonable. I don't even think she believed herself when she said she was ""doing her best."" In the end I got a free personal red velvet pizookie so I was happier, but still disappointed overall. The added gratuity for our large party was just a pain in the ass since the servers really didn't do anything to earn it.  We continued to return after that experience and unfortunately it has not improved, maybe even gotten worse. Lots of people standing around when it's busy and customers need service. They just don't seem to have consideration for customer's time. We always spend way too long waiting and I don't want to spend my entire day in a restaurant for dinner. More than 2 hours from entrance to exit is too long when there isn't a sporting event to watch. Get some more attentive wait staff and this place would be 5 stars. The food is too good not to return and I consider myself a patient person which is why I seem to endure the torture of the horrid service.

Our usual order is a little out of the ordinary, but not complicated, and we have had numerous negative experiences. We've been told by many employees that the Buffalo Chicken pizza comes with a mix of buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce to keep the heat down. I have even emailed a manager regarding this issue, and have been validated.  Unfortunately, even after this, I have been argued with and I have been told that I'm wrong. More often than not, I receive a pizza with BBQ sauce on it, or a pizza without ranch (which seems to be the general ""quick fix"" to a staff member who does not believe me or want to deal with me). I, too, work in the customer service industry, so I understand what it's like to be on the other side, and perhaps that is why I have never made a huge issue of this. However, when I order my pizza with specific instructions, pay 25 dollars for it, and receive it with BBQ sauce again, it kind of sucks! And it's even worse when we get hell from the staff when ordering it! We get our pizza made correctly about 50% of the time, and we get argued with about 80% of the time. It's an unfortunate trade-off. Tonight, we placed our order with an employee named Perry. Of the countless employees we've encountered, he had the BEST attitude regarding our weird order!

No complaints at all BUT I feel that the food has gone greatly downhill. I used to LOVE BJs and the deep dish pizza was always worth the cost. Today, $15 for a small pizza was NOT worth it. It kind of tasted like Pizza Hut with thicker crust and better quality toppings... but still extremely unimpressive and overpriced for the taste. The stuffed mushrooms were... gag! I paid about $45 for the small pizza, a mini pizza, the mini appetizer mushrooms and 2 sodas. Not worth it for the taste of the food.

259,Juan M.,"Grand Terrace, CA",38,35,33.0,1.0,2014-10-13,"Yet another horrible experience. Let me begin by saying that the only reason that I gave them one star was for the hostesses and servers that have been exceptional when it comes to customer service. The management, both back end kitchen and front end are what drive down the rating to zero stars.  So on to last nights experience. I called in an order for curb-side and was told that curb-side ended at 9pm but that I could order take-out. ""No problem"", I replied. I then asked if they had the 2 for $22 deal which she confirmed they did have. Great. So I ordered our usual, A shareable pizza with easy cheese (lactose intolerant), seasoned tomato and extra sauce. Tortilla soup and caesar salad with a pazookie rounded out our order. We used to come more often but have stopped due to the increased level of poor service.  So off I went to go pick up the food. Then I receive a call from BJ's. The young lady that I just spoken with is now informing me that they no longer have the deal. She then asks if I want to cancel the order or order something else. Bewildered, I ask to speak with a manager. The young man gets on the phone and begins to tell me that the special ended Tuesday (Yesterday, being Friday). I then ask if it is now Friday why his staff has not been informed of the specials or lack there of. He then explains that he will allow me to have the special and repeats again that the special ended Tuesday. Great right? He handled the issue and took care of his customer... not so much. I arrive only to find that they have to remake the pizza order because the chef did not want to add the stewed tomatoes.  I waited another 20 minutes for the the pizza to be remade. Now here is some back story. I order that same pizza all the time. 80% of the time it comes out correctly. I have had it sent back multiple times only to have it be brought back incorrectly again. Easy cheese, Stewed tomato, extra sauce... a classic tomato pie... sounds easy right. One time, while dining with my wife, a good friend of hers and her son I placed the same order. The kitchen manager Horacio brings out the pizza personally to my table. When I tell him that the pizza he brought me is simply a cheese pizza (not even easy cheese at that). His reply was that he could bring me a side of stewed tomatoes to put on top. And then began to argue with me how it is the same thing as baking it with the stewed tomatoes and cheese and top. REALLY, THIS IS YOUR KITCHEN MANAGER!!! It is not the same thing. Should he actually try it sometime, he may actually taste the difference. So back to present day. So here I am waiting for the correct order to be made (Wonder who picks up the tab for all those sent back orders). Not once do I see the front end manager come out. It almost seemed like he was hiding in the back. When I asked to speak to the manager in person he finally surfaced. Believe it or not he begins to tell me that the problem is that the stewed tomatoes don't come on the shareable. SERIOUSLY!!! Now this is why I feel you need a new front end manager as well.  BJ's Restaurant has an app for smart phones that allow you to order ahead. I have used it several times. I encourage BOTH OF THE MANAGERS to follow along on their smartphones as they both, obviously, are in some serious need of training. Ok, so now open the BJ's app. Select curb-side pick up.

Which I don't mind however this time the hostess didn't address me for some time and then when she finally did all she told that they would seat us after a couple that I saw standing. Well 10 mins pass and new people came in and were seated right away while we were still waiting. So of course that annoyed us and when we approached the hostess again she just said wait there. Not friendly or professional AT ALL.  After being seated we were approached by out waiter Anthony. He was great. He was all smiles and super friendly. You can tell he was a good waiter because when we asked for our Beers he carded us(which always makes me feel good) when normally no one even asks.

However, I am giving them one star due to their customer service. As we were paying our bills, my total comes out to be $26. I told our waitress Patricia G. that I was going to pay with $23 in cash and wanted the rest on my debit card because I only had $20 remaining in my card, which would not have been sufficient to pay my bill. When she came back with our tabs, I noticed that my card was fully charged $26 (the charge took some of money from my savings account) and none of my bills were in the tab. She claims that she did not see any cash in my tab. I was confused because the cash was securely and visibly tucked underneath the card. I am not sure if the money fell out of the tab or she took the money (which I am just saying could be just a possibility, I am not accusing her of theft). They ended up taking the pizza off the bill and just charging me for the drink.  At the end, I still lost money. It was definitely not a pleasant experience, especially for a birthday celebration. I just wanted to let everyone know to be aware of your payment and make sure that the host charges correctly. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.

229,Breanna S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",52,82,4.0,2.0,2015-06-23,"Well... First off we were seated at a smaller table and upon asking to move we received a bit of an attitude. Once we were moved to a larger table we were told our server would be Melissa. Melissa stopped by about 5 minutes after we were seated and we were told she would be right back. I have worked in the food industry before (from hostess to server) and I know for a fact that there are food runners at BJ's. About 10 minutes and there's Melissa running food out to her table as we sit there without drinks. She finally comes over for our drinks, we tell her what we would like, she asks if we want any appetizers we order two (the calamari and mozzarella sticks) she asks if we're ready to order our meals as well.... UM HM... first you ignore us then you want to rush us? So she brings our drinks a few moments later and we're told our appetizers will be out shortly and that she would bring us some plates (there's six of us at a large table).Well as soon as she said that she would be back with plates our appetizers arrived. We were over half-way through with them before she came back with plates (about 6 minutes and yes I was timing her because I was extremely annoyed with our service). She took our orders asked if we wanted refills and we didn't see her until about 2-3 minutes before our food came out to clear off our empty cups and plates. Our food was decent, not the best I've had from this location, however. Once we were finished with our meals we were asked if we wanted dessert we passed and asked for boxes. The only time she even seemed remotely interested in being our server was when she set the check down (after paying) and told us to enjoy the rest of our day. You cannot provide horrible service and then put the book down and be cheerful at the end of our visit. She received at least the 15% tip but only because we do not dine and not tip.  If she had too many tables or too many guests she should've let someone know and the host or hostess should be instructed how to sit guests accordingly. Having an off day? Let someone know if you can't work through it. We all have bad days but you cannot let it affect your customers. We came down from Lake Arrowhead to enjoy lunch and that really didn't happen.  This was my birthday lunch and I can honestly say I should've gone somewhere else.

My bachelorette party (8.8.15) had nearly 12 indecisive girls, myself included. They were attentive, patient, and suggested a peach margarita(?), which was SUPER delicious.  About 5 minutes after we all finished eating, they sent out three mini pizooki desserts with candles and led the group in ""Hip Hip Hooray"" for me. It was so unexpected and cute, it completely made my night.  As we picked them apart, they processed everyone's bills (which I'm sure were difficult with everyone buying each other drinks) and took care of everything so quickly. The bus boy had the huge table cleared of everything and was incredibly polite. I was so impressed by their teamwork and attention! I'd go out of my way to come back on either of their shifts.

We received the entree but we were waiting on the extra sauce and after 3-4 minutes of waiting we were so hungry we just started to eat. While we ate I was trying to flag down a server and finally when I was able to get a hold of one they said, of course, just to give them a minute. So when another 3 minutes went by I asked another server if they could get us some extra Alfredo sauce, and their response was, ok i'll let your server know. By this point we already gave up on getting our extra Alfredo sauce.  But, finally our server returned to refill our drinks and asked if we needed anything else. We discussed what happened and I guess she just forgot and the other server that said they would inform her never informed her.

(And yet still forgot to ensure our salad dressing on the side). We are generous tippers when we are welcomed with good service. We almost didn't want to leave a tip at all.  However we still did at about (15%). Cuz we're not complete jerks.  After about a 7 to 9 hour drive, she was a big downer to our vibe.

We requested to be seated together and were told there would be an hour and a half wait. We inquired about an area of the restaurant that didn't have any people and were told by the hostess that this area was closed off for the night. In order to avoid the wait we sat in booths that were close to each other instead. As the night went on we noticed that another large party entered the restaurant and were immediately seated in the area that we were told was closed for the night. At this time the restaurant was less crowded than it was when we had arrived. When we inquired about this, the manger told us that the party seated there had a reservation and that's why she opened that area up. She was extremely rude and condescending during this exchange with us. This also didn't make a lot of sense because the hostess gave us a different story. Of course the manager didn't realize that we could ask the party in question if they did have a reservation - which we did. And guess what - of course they didn't. Now we were a group of guys that look Indian/middle eastern and the group that got seated in the area in question were all white. Did racism have a role to play in this situation- I'm not sure... You be the judge of that. All I know is we were extremely disrespected at this establishment and will not be going to another BJs again.

But the 2nd time I go I think our servers name was Lisa horrible job! We sat in her section for a while before even getting greeted like I said I am a server also so I know how it feels to be slammed but at least greet your guest and say your a bit busy and you'll be right with us, she wasn't even the one to greet us it was another server with a beard nice guy, he took our drink order & appetizer order both different timings because our server still wasn't around to greet us, by the time she came she said sorry. Cool! No worries.. She takes our order my bf orders something said ""scratch that"" IN that moment she was taking our order and had went with a different dish when the food comes out mine perfect & his was not the original meal he had ordered. Her excuse was ""I'm sorry I remember the pita tacos by memory"" okay??? Your writing our order with a book look down and read what you wrote.

Apparently the manager tried everything. I was told that there is a $50 balance on my card and that Bj's tried charging $50.88 instead of $50 that's why the card declined.

The appetizer mozzarella sticks were fantastic, nice and garlicky (because that's a word now). Crispy outside, gooey center, the way a cheese stick is supposed to be. So that was tasty. For the main event, however, we ordered the lunch chicken Alfredo for the lady, and for moi, the 14oz rib-eye in medium-rare, because this is America and that's as close to tasting freedom as it gets without stuffing a flag into your mouth. Both dishes were brought out in good time, and the food was great! The meat was tender and juicy, but properly cooked. I also liked that the waitress didn't hit us up every 12.3 seconds to ask us if we were okay or if I'd seen the last season of LOST. All in all, it was fantastic.

19,Kenny G.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",299,1009,961.0,3.0,2017-01-20,"Let's face facts. If you've been to one BJ's, then you've pretty much been to them all. What separates the harlots from the hoez' is by FARRR,..........the customer service and overall flare of the location itself yet, ......this particular location, resting off of Tippicanoe, fellow pizookie loving Yelpers, may just leave you with blue balls and a need to dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT caus' I've certainly put better into my mouth..... Wait a minute. That didn't come out quite right, lol. What I meant was..... uhm..... Better yet (leans back.....) let's just commence within this review...... * * * * * ""Eeenie weenie, teenie weenie, shriveled little short short ....."" Sauntered in on a Friday evening. My sister made the trek from Vegas to celebrate her 13th ""21st"" birthday and with that in hindsight, the least I/we could do was drive from LA to meet up with her and her crew, right?  Fortunately we were stuck in traffic stemming from the rain and EVERYONE knows that Californians can't drive in spit.......let alone condensation. Consequentially, this better enabled my sis' and her posse' to wait (within our absence) and better secure seating, and we were able to walk in - to VIP treatment, bypassing the unprivileged to join her party.  In advance, I find this ironic but AIN'T IT A SHAME THAT WE HAD TO DRIVE OUT FROM LOS ANGELES TO ORDER AN ""L.A. WATER""????  From sit down, were we all addressed and our server was outstanding until he went on break and his replacement went MIA.  Y'all know, I'm from ""the city"" and indicative of such, I reserved no hesitation in ordering a round of shots! For just around $80, we were all able to ring in the night and this, seemingly set the tone for our miserly session of dining whilst in the lovely I.E. (spoken with all due sarcasm).  While the place was packed and parking was a clusterphuk, the server did his best in getting our booze back to us at light speed. Hardly hungry and still pissed from the previously endured gridlock, I requested 'artichoke dip' ($8.95) as well as a side of --something-- else.....and in all truth, had it been any bit revolutionary, I'd probably recall the name of it right now.  Need I state that upon downing a tablespoon of both items, they were duly rejected; quicker than a hooker caught without her paperwork.  I viewed a number of folks requesting additional items; from pot stickers to calamari and nachos. * The irony however, is that NO ONE cleaned their plate, nor did they request a doggy bag, ""to go""!  Now I ain't one tuh' gossip, .....but isn't the TRUE testament of consumer satisfaction when a guest unbuckles his/her belt after licking the plate clean? ----- I'm just sayin'.  Monica Lewinsky must've taken a off day.  It's a brewery so I'm certain the beer is fine, thereon, I'm more of a wine/cocktail fella' and regrettably I'm unable to report on such. As a last method of recourse, I ordered the clam chowder.  (sighs........)  Suddenly it became so dayum clear that I was just NOTTT meant to be at this place. I haven't been this bamboozled since ...(thinks to self), I mistakenly went to 'The Chicken Ranch' in Pahrump, NV and attempted to order buffalo wings.  O__o Perverts, feel free to read on that experience here:    NC-17 colloquialisms aside, I'm obligated to render the following assessment. BJ's has presented itself as being a marginal franchise's attempt in conveying nothing short of meager American cuisine, with hit or miss service and lines that rival the DMV just to get in.  Hadn't it been for the booze and customer service, I'd just have easily provided this location 1 star.  Further placing things into perspective, EVERY guy loves a BJ yet this particular location provided somewhat of a disappointing ""Happy Ending"". By no means am I taking this place completely off of my list, if anything, now it's just muddling around the bottom like ......that one hot chick with syphilis that you have to think twice on texting at midnight.  Factoring in all of the other options around (which doesn't say much when in San Bernardino).........you might go so far as to request Uber pick her up, but you for damned sure know that she's not worth traveling to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino,3.96,3.59,3.364,2.668,3.738
63,J C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-02-04,"A week or so ago, we ate in the bar area.  Our waitress was slow in getting to our table.  All we wanted when she did come was water, while we looked at the menu.  Time ticks by.  Nothing.  Then after a very long time, we notice TWO tables of people that came AFTER we did, got their drinks!  When I walked up to the hostess and requested a manager, this guy named Jose shows up.  I explained what just happened and he said, ""I apologize.""  But I wasn't done speaking.  When I told him that it wasn't right that the waitress did that, he said to me in an irritated tone of voice, ""ALL I CAN DO IS APOLOGIZE!"" Wow! I got his business card from the hostess and it says ""Senior Manager"".  Very unprofessional for someone of his status.  The service was slow.  Our waitress didn't check on us and the whole experience was disappointing.  I have celebrated many a birthday at this location, but never again.  After contacting BJ's through email from their website, I get a call back from the Gen. Mgr. Brian Sunday.  I explain the whole ordeal.  He was apologetic etc, and offered to make it right with a $25.00 gift card.   So last night, we decide to give it one more try.  ANOTHER HORRIBLE experience, but even worse!  We sat at the bar again, even at the same table.  Our waitress was extremely slow, worse than the previous experience!  After my friend waited and waited, she asked another server for the two samples of beer she was supposed to try.  More waiting...Finally it came.  After deciding which one to get, the beer came in a glass that was narrowed to a stem at the bottom.  This is important because that's where she was holding it while she drank her beer.  But then at one point she slid her hand up higher and felt something hard and crusty!  UGH!  No one wants to feel crusty things on the outside of their glass that they have been drinking out of, who knows what it is for God's sake!  When she told the waitress, there was no apology and she said she would pour it in another glass.  Another beer came.  I went up to the hostess desk and asked if ""Brian"" was there, and he was.  He came over, I reminded him that I had spoke of the phone with him a week before, and then told him what had happened with the beer glass. I also inquired as to how many tables a waitress has, and he said 5.  Again, he was apologetic for our experience.  He offered us a free pazookie and took the gift card paper, and brought us the receipt and said he took care of everything.  Good thing I looked at the receipt because the waitress had charged us for TWO beers!!!!!  I asked for Brian and he was in a meeting and we got ""Roxy"".  Had to explain the whole story to her, and then she went and fixed it.  In the mean time our waitress came by and said, ""Oh she's adjusting it.""  NO APOLOGY from her!   The pizza that I always order from BJ's is definitely NOT worth the horrible service!  I will NOT be returning to the San Bernardino location ever again.  Maybe on the way to the beach, I would stop at BJ's but not here.  There is something definitely wrong with the service in the bar area and maybe Brian should address that by reducing the amount of tables a waitress has so she can give better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=80,3.8,3.56,3.352,2.436,3.656

93,Ronny M.,"Santa Monica, CA",7,47,49.0,1.0,2017-06-22,"So this is my second review for BJs in about a month. Last month we had a graduation luncheon at another location in Ontario. I posted a review and the general manager reached out to me to give BJs another shot. Well, we did. And I'm sorry that we did so. The service was terrible once again. My girlfriend and I decided to try the near by BJs in San Bernardino for Father's Day. My daughter showed up a little late and unfortunately also experienced a bad experience as well. Basically our waitress barked out quick sentences at us like a drill Sargent. ""Djou reddytoorder""!! Then would run away like faster than Forest Gump. I mean, geaze. The group next to actually got all their drinks, conversation from the waitress, and even refills!! I'm starting to wonder if these establishments don't like dark haired men with dark skin and beards!?!  I was not asked or offered water since I ordered the 4-4oz beer sampler. I was not offended another round. Was not asked if the beer was ok.  At first it was the 2 of us, my GF and I. I ordered a medium pizza for my daughter and I as she was late and on her way when I ordered. I also ASKED! Does the PIZZA a medium sized, PIZZA feed 2,TWO, PEOPLE!?? Hint hint!! That means there will be 2 people eating pizza!!  So when the tray arrives for the Pizza to sit on with a plate, not 2 plates, but 1 plate. We also at that point asked for silver ware as well.  Later about 5 minutes after the pizza arrived so did my daughter. I gave her my water after about 15 minutes of conversation and eating as the waitress did not ask my daughter if she wanted to order or a liquid drink?!! More time goes by as it is Father's Day and we are eating and drinking our soda and water? Yes, only 2 drinks still at a table with 3 patrons!! PLUS!! Our drinks are bone dry at this point. So we patiently wait, as our waitress zooms by like we don't exist, oh wait, she had time to slap a bill down and race away with our 2 drinks dry as a camels tongue!! My daughter even said that she never even saw the waitresses face she was so in a hurry helping everyone else but us.  This waitress was by far the WORST I've ever experienced. And I've been to Europe where they don't care about service.  Never ever giving BJs a chance again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=40,3.0,3.45,3.276,2.9160000000000004,3.27

Our orders were a little of everything, arranging from steak to salad to pasta.  Each dish was cooked perfectly, and came out at just the right temp.  The alfredo was a little skimpy on the broccoli, but once my husband mentioned it, a side of steamed broccoli was brought out almost immediately for him to add to his existing dish.   Their signature dessert was on sale, and ashamed to say-we bought and demolished three of their Pizookees.   Must say the hostess was very entertaining and energetic and was shocked at our first visit, but made sure we had all the details need to make our visit special!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino,3.52,3.47,3.308,3.572,3.49

It's pretty bad when you don't even go into the restaurant before posting a bad review***  First of all, BJ's and I don't have a lovely history, but I decided to give it a try today anyway. I have a meeting coming up in a few days and I was looking for a place with good food and thought, ""why not BJ's?"".... Yeah they reminded me why not BJ's. I called to set the reservation and this is how the conversation went.  Phone rings. Employee answers.  Employee: Thank you for calling BJ's. How many I help you? Me: Hi. I'm looking to make a reservation for a meeting on Monday. We are looking to have about 12-15 people. I'm wondering if your restaurant would be conducive to a meeting of that size? Employee: Sure, I'm going to have to get my manager for you. Please hold.  ***Hold for about 3 minutes** Employee: Thank you for holding, just give her a few more minutes and she will be with you.  Me: Okay ***Hold for 15 minutes*** Manager: Hi. Thank you for holding. So you want to have a meeting here. When are you looking to hold it? Me: Monday, January 8 at 11:30am. We are looking to have 15 people there. Would that work with your location? Manager: Okay. Let me put you on hold and check my calendar.  Me: My last hold was 15 minutes, would it be sooner than that? Manager: Yes. I'll be right back.  ***Hold for 10 minutes*** Manager: What time did you want to have your reservation? Me: I was on hold for another 10 minutes. Are you guys okay over there?  Manager: **giggles** Yes, we're just really busy because it's our lunch hour and I'm trying to make sure everyone gets served. Me: Right. But it has taken me 30 minutes to make a reservation.  Manager: **ignores my comment** May I have your name and phone number for the reservation?
