52,Sarah E.,"Olympia, WA",67,599,71.0,2.0,2012-10-24,"I used to love Applebee's....when I was a kid. I came here for a kid's b-day party and even though we had a large group, they seated us and waited on us very quickly. The reason why my review is so low is the food. It seems like everything served here comes out of a bag or can and NOTHING is fresh. I seriously can't imagine how much preservatives and high fructose corn syrup is in their food.  They do have a great dinner deal for two people where you share an appetizer and each get an entree for $20. We tried their buffalo wings, which were 99% breading and 1% chicken so it tasted like a bread ball drenched in buffalo sauce. Eh gross. The entree selections were dominated by shrimp, which I am allergic to so that eliminated 5 of the 8 possibilities for me. We ended up trying the riblet basket and the oriental chicken salad. The salad hardly had any lettuce, and was mostly dried noodles and almonds. Weird, and gross. The riblets were good. The BBQ sauce was alright, and overall it was OK. They were having happy hour, which is a pretty good deal. I had a hurricane and it was very strong and delish for only $5. I needed all of that booze to get me through the crap food. Overall the service is great, but the food is gross. I ended up paying for it later that day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006
43,Violet V.,"Olympia, WA",61,15,,4.0,2013-02-22,"Excellent steaks, attentive service and REALLY good prices. Came here on a Friday night, they very busy but we were able to get a seat in the bar right away. Decided on the 2 for $20 deal, and both ended up ordering the same thing: sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Shared the buffalo chicken ""wings"", which were the only ""eh"" part of the meal. Weren't terrible, but wouldn't order again. The steaks were PERFECT, tender and juicy. Vegetables were cooked well but bland and could have been fresher. Not bad though. All the wait staff were very friendly and attentive, really awesome service.  Only complaints: Upon being served, waitress asked us to slice into our steaks to check if done to our liking. Although it was nice of her to make sure, this resulted in a lot of juices running from the steaks. :( Would have preferred to let it rest a minute first, but didn't want to refuse the request. Seems like this  practice is Applebee's policy, should be reconsidered in my opinion. Girlfriend wanted a beer, but selection was limited. Do people actually drink Coors? 0_o Anyways, she went with a Pyramid Haywire which ended up costing $5.50!? Way too pricey for a mediocre beer, will definitely hit happy hour or skip beverages next time. Overall, the service, really yummy food, and great value mean we will definitely be back. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=40,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

32,Estella N.,"Seattle, WA",6,75,27.0,4.0,2013-06-09,"First time visit at this location for brunch with family and friends.  We arrived soon after they opened and seated immediately.  Our server was new to Applebees and let us know, but did very well and was very attentive and personable.   I ordered hot tea and noticed that the metal tea pot thing was a little crusty on the buttom.  I took the spoon and scraped the bottom and some residue dislodged and floated in the water. I didn't drink it. Thankfully I was given a mug of hot water in addition to the tea pot so all was well in the tea enjoyment experience aside from the crusty pot.  I was also given a wedge of lemon, packet of honey, and spoon with my tea which was nice.   I ordered the biscuits and gravy meal. It didn't take long for our orders to be ready and the eggs were nicely cooked to order.  Yum! The meal was altogether savory and filling. The biscuits were a bit hard on the outside but the insides were soft.  The ample gravy helped soften the outer part of the biscuits. Yum nonetheless. The sausage was chewy, maybe a little overcooked, but I prefer that vs undercooked.  I'll definitely come back again for breakfast and brunch. Service and food was pretty darn good. I also liked arriving soon after they open, it's quiet and calm and quick service.

I like to sit in the bar for a bit better atmosphere. The Green Bean Crispers appetizer is DELICIOUS, if you're into that sort of thing (I am, and how). Ditto the won-ton taco appetizer, and pub pretzel sticks.  The fries are usually over-salted. I put copious amounts of salt on most things, and I don't need to salt the fries here. That's pretty unheard of for me, so I am just going to assume that some people would be a bit displeased with them. They changed the French Onion Soup recipe about a year or so ago, and it's definitely not as good as it once was.  I also mysteriously never seem tempted by any of their desserts...everything seems to be some combination of ice cream and/or chocolate - 2 things this Martian isn't that excited by.

The salad part was fine, huge difference from the advertised picture. It's deceiving! Very disappointed! My server was okay, although she disappeared after taking my food order, I couldn't find her to order a drink, looked around and the managers were happily having conversations at the bar with other servers, saw my wondering looks but no response!!!!!

A couple of weeks ago, we ordered takeout and I found several long dark hairs in my mashed potatoes. There were these same hairs in the green beans. That was straight up nasty. I ended up throwing my food away. I ordered a steak as well and requested it well done. I received it BARELY medium well. There was still a lot of pink in it. I basically couldn't eat any of it.  This was the only time I've had issues with the food here, but for me, it's a big deal to have hair in the food. That's just gross.

20,Jason L.,"Lacey, WA",0,26,7.0,2.0,2016-11-25,"I have come to the conclusion that Applebee's has fallen on hard times. Service is really not up to par, and the quality of their appetizers leave a fair bit to be desired.  Couple all of this with a happy hour that isn't worth coming in for, in terms of value.  The bartender, N. W. seems more preoccupied with inviting patrons who are regulars to a party at her house than with paying attention to the rest of the bar. She could also learn to practice some discretion by controlling the volume of her voice.  And, make sure you ask for the check very clearly, because even with the bar emptying out, it is a hell of an ordeal getting a check.  Then again, I think our bartender needs to take up a career in party planning, rather than bartending.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

Asked if it was plain, the waitress explained that it had butter and garlic on it... but that she could get 'Childs broccoli ', which would be plain.    When my dish came, broccoli was dripping with butter,  I asked to make sure--- they came and took it away!   As we were settling our checks, the waitress informed us that our meager steaks were indeed 8 oz not 6 oz and we would be charged accordingly!   Humph!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

I got home & called to talk to manager. After waiting 3 min. a person answered & I explained what happened. He said he wasn't manager & that they were very busy.

19,Jisool M.,"Olympia, WA",0,2,,3.0,2017-01-28,"Service - was a little slow on a Friday night. One thing I was surprised to see was that the waitress (who brought the ice drinks) just sprayed the ice cubes across the floor from her tray after delivering our drinks. They must have been ice cubes that were left on her tray but I was really surprised at her manner to have left ice cubes everywhere where customers could have stepped and slipped on them..  Food - I had the ribs and it was well cooked, but the sauce was a little salty. The Caesar salad was decently fresh vegetables but the dressing made the lettuce a little matted. The cheese potatoes and broccoli sides were yummy and went well with the ribs. Ingredients could be fresher, but overall was decent quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-olympia-2,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

My boyfriend and I have tried many different entrees and apps. One of our favorite appetizers is the Siracha Shrimp! The burgers are a little messy, but packed with flavor. Last visit I had the pulled pork tacos, which were amazing! There is so much to choose from! However, What really makes the experience is the service. We have visited this location 8 or so times, and have never received poor service. That alone says something for a restaurant. Genesis, or waitress the other evening, is truly phenomenal. She is so genuine and knowledgeable. She represents the establishment enthusiastically, and really makes us feel welcomed and comfortable every time . She possess an upbeat and professional demeanor which is so very rare. She is absolutely impressive and a true gem!!!! We can't wait to go back!

1,Matt L.,"Olympia, WA",14,1,,1.0,2017-08-21,"This is one of the worst places I've eaten at in the last year.  I used to be a loyal customer,  but the food was never great. However,  over the last year it's gotten pretty bad.   The service in Olympia isn't so bad.  The food is, other than the grilled asparagus.  Steaks are over cooked; a medium well came out past well done, and a medium came out well done on the verge of being well done. The mashed potatoes are are rubbery.  The appetizers are much smaller than they used to be,  and rubbery.  The only thing good about applebees is the perfect margarita.  I will not be visiting here again to choke down less than McDonalds quality food. If it's not obvious,  that was an insult.

The manager's name is Victor and he exceeded out of his way to make us satisfied, the server, ehhhh, not so really... I would have this review a two stars but Victor deserves five stars for his awesome service and providing us positive attitude!
