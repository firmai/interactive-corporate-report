Murgatroyd A.,"Glendale, AZ",0,3,,4.0,1/10/2013,This was not gourmet dining but the food was tasty and nicely prepared!  The manager was vigilant about keeping customers happy.  I just ate there a week ago and was shocked to see it had closed.  I  also recenly learned the Friday's in Phoenix as well as Surprise has closed.  I will miss the Glendale Friday's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glendale

Marty F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",265,314,13,3.0,4/6/2011,"For the life of me, I couldn't check into the location that Yelp had, so it showed this.  So lets hope it is and if not, oh well.  For years, I literally avoided TGI Friday's because i had a boring experience there.  Yeah, I said boring.  The food was barely ok and the place was just dull.  Unfortunately that location burned down to the grown (Chandler location). When i was there I ordered the fried mac n cheese and I gotta say, i could make better mac n cheese with my eyes closed with no ingriedients.  Talk about bland.  This was the worst appetizer Ive ever had.  That was then.. So at this location, I had a total change of heart.  First off, TGI removed the nasty Mac N Cheese balls (good job!) and we ordered fried green beans.  Damn they were yummy!.   We got something else that was good.. Ohh yeah.. I remember.  I think it was shrimp or something.  I know, I don't remember.  But it was good too. I got their ever popular Jack Daniels BBQ burger.  This is a  burger that is nationwide known from TGI and I finally had it.  guess what?  It's a burger with BBQ sauce on it. Nothing to go to the press over, but it was just good.  Drinks were good and refills were always coming.  So over all, the food was good. Service was great.  We tend to all go out with a bunch of people, so Im always impressed when they handle a group of 8-10 people.  Nice work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glendale
