O'Zandra F.,"Sulphur, LA",95,209,489,4.0,7/25/2017,Great place to chill out after a long day of work. The staff is always pleasant. Dinner time is the best time to visit. I've come a couple times during lunch hours.  Bad mistake. Service was extremely slow! Sit at the bar.... Faster service.  I'm a creature of habit...I generally get the boneless buffalo salad. It's good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Jaeger G.,"Orange Park, FL",111,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,Very noisy staff and my hamburger patty was falling apart and was full of gristle. I love Chili's but will never come to this location and I do not recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Mien P.,"Houston, TX",1,3,2,1.0,6/4/2017,Worst place in Louisiana. No management here at all #Chili's . Fighting in the kitchen and no service for 20min. #chilismagement.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Maria D.,"Houston, TX",42,2,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Stopped quickly for late night meal after driving  about 13 hours  and the restaurant  was super dirty , no hostess was at the front to sit us down we had to look for someone.  my salad was horrible super soggy lettuce. it was just a very bad experience bad food bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur

Bobby B.,"Sulphur, LA",27,1,,1.0,7/25/2017,"We have ate dinner here 3 different times. Every time the service was horrible. This last time our waiter was trying his best he was working our tables and the other waitresses tables, that were to busy gossiping and playing on there phones. But the absolute worst part of the whole experience was when we walked in the hostess didnt say a word she was to busy on Facebook, twitter, plenty of fish who knows, my wife had to say something to get her attention. Then she acted like it was an inconvenience for her to put her phone down and sit us at a table ( and did I mention ever table that didn't have anyone sitting at it was filthy). Its really a shame, but we will no longer waste our money there and i strong advise everyone else to pick somewhere else to eat",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Marlo M.,"Palmdale, CA",17,519,1507,3.0,4/4/2016,It's Chilis not much to say I probably would have given it 4 stars because my server was great but tell me why everything in Louisiana has to be spicy I just wanted a salad and salad that's all why do you have to make the dressing spicy no where else have I ordered a Santa Fe salad and it's burning spicy only in Louisiana.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Mike A.,"Clute, TX",1,5,,1.0,8/19/2016,Customer service and food really sux . Will never eat at this location ever again . Waitress was not very attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Marius K.,"Geyserville, CA",2,95,51,2.0,3/21/2015,Well the service was good - the hostess the waitress I would give them 4 stars The kitchen - what are you guys Waffle House ? Burned salmon Burned potatoes  Empty ketchup bottles on the tables  Place have a feel of sports bar  Never again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Ashlie' C.,"Sulphur, LA",13,13,23,1.0,4/12/2017,My children and I went to eat here Saturday during the day hardly anyone was there so there was no excuse for the waitress who was terrible to have taken forever to even come get our drink orders then finally when we get our drinks the sweet tea was so disgusting it tasted old I asked for them to make some more and give me a water until then (needless to say I never received that sweet tea) when we finally got our food we waited an hour and a half for (No Joke) it was cold and my steak was hard couldn't pull it apart and they had no silverware because they said it had to be washed! So we waited 2hrs got nothing to eat our cold hard food with and had terrible service when I kept telling the waitress when she would actually come about all the things that were wrong she never once apologized so after 2 hours we finally left and my children that ate there cold food all got sick . They need all new people there and obviously new management because if they know how that place is being ran than shame on them!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
lee c.,"Kansas City, MO",6,263,79,1.0,6/8/2015,"Just walked in for lunch with the wife, we stood for five minutes. No one seen, no one serving tables nada. Yes there were customers having lunch, but this could be a indication of the service. Second chillies that let me down...why does my wife keep trying to go here??? Yep, you guys need to close down....see other reviews..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Isaac C.,"Sulphur, LA",0,3,,1.0,3/6/2016,The service here is so slow Got my salad with my meal Never got my appetizer got the chips with out my chess this place sucks in services,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Mindy A.,"Strawn, TX",1,13,7,1.0,3/6/2015,Horrible greasy food! Service was also horrible. Worse excuse I ever seen for a chillis. Will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Robert B.,"Lake Charles, LA",0,4,,4.0,6/9/2015,"I've heard of poor service here before but I was surprised by how many negative reviews were on here.  I ate here maybe 2 weeks ago, Sunday, after church with two friends. Everything was great. We were seated immediately, waitress was nice and had cool hair.  The food took maybe 15mins to come out, but that's fine as I ate a lot of chips.  What did I order?.... Oh! I remember- Some sort of chicken sandwich with avocado. It was good.  really no complaints at all.  I'll definitely go back sometime. And hope I'm lucky again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Daniel J.,"Ridgecrest, CA",0,10,14,3.0,9/13/2015,"I think the cook smashed my RibEye with a mallet to make it cook quicker.  What came to the plate was a dried up meat pancake.  Golden crispy on one surface like a pancake too.  Have you had a fatty, somewhat gristly, but mostly dry steak before? Not being a steakhouse I won't hold them fully to those standards.  Finding out that happy hour is two beers for the price of one was nice.  The water was a bit off, but that may be the standard out here.  May be an ok restaurant, but go elsewhere for steaks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Brian B.,"Sulphur, LA",2,41,2,2.0,8/24/2015,"Its s chilies and not a good one. Always out of stuff, burnt food, crappy service, and generic food. Now it is a chain style restaurant so the fiod taste about the same everywhere so if you like it you could get something you like. Not my first pick on that strip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Michelle C.,"New Haven, CT",0,12,,1.0,3/8/2015,"Just stopped for lunch with the family on the way from New Orleans to Galveston. This was hands-down the absolute worst dining experience of our lives. To start there was the 45 minute wait, when we were told 15 and there were a of open table. Which didn't really matter as we would have just sat there waiting at the table anyway. The service was atrocious. Waited 15 minutes for a server, he was rude and unhelpful. Waited 35 minutes for food. First came or son's burnt macaroni and cheese. Then my dry turkey burger with no condiments. Then my husband's cold buffalo chicken sandwich. Then waited 30 minutes for a drink refill. Asked 4 times and gave up and left. Wish i could give no stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Susan D.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/17/2015,"Don't eat here unless you have 2 hours to kill. Just ate here.  My family of five (including a toddler) arrived at 11:35 for lunch.  No wait.  In fact, a half of the restaurant was empty.  Our food finally arrived 60 minutes later.  Of course we had inquired a few times and complained to the manager.  She said she'd come visit our table.  Never did.  The waitress blamed the kitchen and yet in our glorious 1.5 hours there she never once refilled drinks or checked on us in any way.  Thank goodness my kids are well behaved so it wasn't unpleasant in that way.  No one came to apologize or explain what happened when they weren't even that busy.  If they care so little about the customer experience, I wonder how much they care about cleanliness, food preparation, staff hygiene, etc??  I wouldn't eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Brent G.,"Baytown, TX",42,9,,1.0,8/14/2015,Food was on par for a Chili's but the service was the worst I've had in awhile. Super long wait time to be seated even though the restaurant wasn't overly busy and the waitress was terrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Kyle Haley M.,"Vinton, LA",4,3,,1.0,6/2/2014,"This is seriously the worst Chilis I've ever been to, and I'd go as far to say one of the worst restaurants in general. The service is consistently horrible with rude workers and the food always cold or wrong. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt and have given this location more opportunities to redeem itself than it deserves. Do yourself a favor and eat at the Raising Canes next door, I promise you will be less disappointed .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur
Alex D.,"Portland, ME",0,8,4,3.0,12/24/2015,Wasn't particularly anything to write home about but I was on a road trip by myself and some random patrons across the bar from me bought my food and beer for me so that was cool.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur?start=20
Doug A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,,2.0,8/14/2015,The service was mediocre and the kitchen timing was non existent. If the kitchen is slow its one thing but don't take ten minutes to send out an appetizer salad the send out the entree two minutes later. I can't give it one star since the food was pretty good and I went in with tempered expectations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur?start=20
Roderick F.,"New Orleans, LA",131,22,10,4.0,6/15/2013,By far the best Chili's in the Lake Charles area . Always clean and fully staffed my order is usually right and well prepared . I usually order from the lighter choices menus and sometimes the ribs all are always served the way they looked on the menu and taste wonderful . For a chain restaurant this is a must stop at least once a week,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur?start=20
Amy B.,"Sulphur, LA",134,70,,2.0,9/18/2013,"1) I started off with a dirty seat (had chips & salt on it), 2) server was attentive but had another large party to attend to- she did a pretty good job taking our order, refilling drinks, & bringing our soup at the beginning & check at the end, 3) thankfully we both got soup because it took OVER 30 MINUTES for our entrees to be cooked & delivered! and the restaurant was NOT that busy at the time we were there (8pm on a Tuesday, only 2 of us). 4) After she seated us- the whole time we were there- I saw the hostess hanging out & texting on her phone by the back door near the register & I thought that was very strange. 5) In general: poor time management seems to be a trend at this particular location per my experiences here (~8 visits) and either the server or kitchen is very slow at every visit....it's got great food, but the service speed needs a kick in the pants! (And sadly I've heard this location is better than the one in LC.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sulphur?start=20
