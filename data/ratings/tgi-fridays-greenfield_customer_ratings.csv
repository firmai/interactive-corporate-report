However, my credit card company called me Sunday evening and said there were 2 charges on my card in Texas & CA, one was $436. No card was swiped, my numbers were entered manualy.. The last person to touch my credit card was my waitress at TGI Friday's. I am not accusing her, I just know that my numbers were stolen.

27,Erin M.,"Morton Grove, IL",10,26,2.0,2.0,2013-12-02,"I've not dined at a TGI Friday's in years, because I've always found their menu to be ""meh"" -- meaning there is absolutely nothing on the menu that sounds terrific to me.   Everything sounds pretty ok.   My husband and I found ourselves here on the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend as we drove back from Wisconsin to Illinois.  We were enticed by the IMMEDIATE SEATING neon sign, figuring at 7pm on a holiday weekend, we should take what we can get.  Next time, I'd prefer to wait for something better, I think... Our waitress was hyper-present at first, and then non-existent.  When we were seated, we ordered drinks, and my husband headed to the bathroom.  When the waitress brought the drinks, she asked if we'd like an appetizer; I told her I'd wait until  my husband returned.  She returned literally within 3 minutes, just as my husband sat down, and asked again.  I again asked for a few minutes, and at this point, I think she shut down on us.  We only saw her thrice more for service during the meal: once when she took our food order, once for the dessert order and once for the check.  She kept herself occupied cleaning tables and floors around us the rest of the time. We ordered mozzarella sticks as an app.  They were adequate.  Again, nothing great.  My husband ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta and I ordered a combo of boneless buffalo wings, potato skins and fried green beans (I'm pregnant, leave me alone).  My food was ok-- the buffalo wings were the highlight, sauced well and a large portion.  My husband didn't finish his pasta, a sure sign something was wrong.  I reached over for a bite and my instant reaction was ""Oh my God, that's terrible!""  The pasta sauce was watery and flavorless, the noodles were total mush, and the chicken was mealy.  My husband agreed, but since he had been the one to suggest TGIF, I suspect he felt guilty complaining.  We finished with peanut butter pie for dessert, and it, too, was ok.  It was far too warm for my liking; I expected an ice-cold, firm slice of pie akin to cheesecake, but instead was served a jiggly, gelatinous concoction. Overall, based on this TGIF experience, I'll keep in in my list of places to reserve as a last resort.  For a $35 meal in this category, I'd much rather spend my money at Chili's or Red Robin and enjoy the food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenfield?start=20,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004
25,Christophor R.,"Milwaukee, WI",17,11,1.0,1.0,2014-06-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, Fridays are over. It is no longer Friday in there, now it is more like a Monday and rarely does someone utter the phrase TGI Monday... They have redesigned the menu and it is a buzzword bandwagon stuffed pile of lies. ""Handcrafted"" it proudly says on the cover, but they still serve the exact same product you can buy in the freezer section of your local supermarket under their brand. The menu continues on with words like regional, all-natural, blah blah blah. On the draft beer portion of the menu it says ""local"" but on that list, not a single beer was from within the state, let alone one of the local Milwaukee breweries. In essence they took what they did really well, decent bar food in a decent atmosphere, and tried to slap on the latest trend. It doesn't work, and now, the whole place is broken.  When we first walked in there were 2 hosts, a male and female, and they seemed utterly perplexed, almost angry, that we entered and wanted a table. They weren't even sure which of them would seat us and, in front of us, had a terse conversation about it. Clearly, Friday's no longer bothers to train their staff in proper customer service and expectations. As we got to the table the girl asked ""did you want a sling for that?"" talking about our newborn...  When we were seated the waitress was fairly prompt in arriving but did not mention a word about how the menu had changed. Of course there's not much to say about slapping on buzzwords, raising the prices slightly and calling the most expensive thing in each section the ""house favorite,"" is there? The waitress also seemed poorly trained, drinks remained empty for noticeable periods of time, and then when my burger came, I had asked for it medium rare, it was closer to charcoal. Definitely well done. The fact that servers ask ""pink or no pink"" to begin with just shows the utter lack of training. The burger tasted burnt, and as if they had sprayed some ""smoky"" flavor chemical on it. So I sent it back. She seemed confused that I wanted to just have the new burger boxed (we have a newborn and time was running out). Eventually, she understood to just put the new burger in a to-go box and take the charcoal burger away. The manager returned with the new burger, apologized, and said he took care of ""both burgers."" Which makes it sound like I would have been charged. Again, training. He, the manager, had a fairly unkempt appearance overall and my first thought was along the lines of drinking problem. This was our third time at this location in 6 months, because I used to enjoy it, and it will be our last visit to Friday's for a long time. It has been going down in flames for some time and I think it's finally hit the ground and lies in a burning pile of wreckage. I used to love Friday's as a relaxed place to hangout after work with a couple friends and have some mostly decent food and drink. Now I view it as dismal, dreary and almost painful to visit, so we won't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenfield?start=20,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

Foreshadowing, clearly.  The cheese sauce for the pretzel sticks was watery and gross. The steak tasted old. The sides were super salty. The burger was decent but by the time we got it as a replacement we were already turned off and couldn't eat it. Never received a drink refill. Waitress was nice, but clueless. Manager came over at the end of the meal and offered appetizer credit. Uhm. Won't be coming back. Useless.  It's been a while since we ate at a Fridays, but who knew it would be that bad.

Then the hostess with every other table open sits a table of four right next to my husband and I. Are you kidding me?

If you aren't a fan of garlic, this might not be for you. It is loaded with pieces of garlic goodness. Currently they are offering endless apps. You can't go wrong here, for one set price the endless apps are a sure fire winner. If you are the type that doesn't like to wait to be seated, you're in luck. You can seat your self in the bar area and skip all the people waiting to be seated.

Our waitress was present and friendly, but I can't remember her name. Also when our food was served she didn't bring extra napkins or offer to bring any, we had to ask. Also our entrées came immediately after the appetizers with no time to enjoy in between.  We were seated diagonal from the kitchen and I found it distracting as I was able to watch everyones meals being made, and also all the waitstaff dance and sing around. Our waitress was biting her nails. To add to the distraction, the manager started discussing holiday shift schedules with the waitstaff two tables away from where we were sitting.  In closing as I said the food was amazing, my steak delicious, and our waitress friendly they just missed the mark a bit in a few other areas.

3,Jennifer R.,"Greendale, WI",94,286,99.0,4.0,2015-11-04,"My husband and I frequent this location on a regular basis because it is close to home and the service is good. We come in here so often, the staff knows what we like to drink and gets us our drinks as soon as we come in the door (My go-to drink is a Long Island iced tea and my husband's is unsweetened iced tea). Our usual spot to sit is in the bar area. This way, we avoid the wait for a table and can watch whichever sports game is currently on the TV.  The food and drinks here are delicious. At our most recent visit, I tried one of their new menu items. I had the Bourbon Barrel Mahi Mahi. It is seasoned with hickory smoked sea salt and fired over a plank soaked in bourbon. It was very tender and delicious. My husband had his usual, which is the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta. The chicken is marinated and all natural, and the dish is topped with balsamic glaze and parmesan shavings. I've had this dish myself, and it is good. His only complaint is that they changed the kind of noodles they use. They used to use angel hair pasta. Now they use fettuccine noodles. (True story: on one visit, we actually brought in a box of angel hair pasta to see if they could make my husband's meal with it. Management explained to us that for liability reasons, they could not do that. Okay. We figured there would be no harm in asking).  If you dine at TGI Friday's regularly, I highly recommend that you sign up for their Stripes program. Your earn stripes with every purchase, and can redeem them for free appetizers, entrees, and deserts. You'll also get coupons in the mail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-greenfield,,,,,

I saw some bits of red onion, a small leaf of cilantro, but I couldn't tell that there were any other ingredients.   Otherwise, my burger was great, the broccoli and cheese soup was tasty, and the chips for the salsa (not the salsa itself) was good.  The staff and our server were friendly and quick with our needs.

The only part that she was happy with were the seasoned fries. The chicken breast on the sandwich was dry and hard (over cooked) The sandwich had a sauce but the chef didn't put enough on the sandwich. My wife asked our server for extra sauce. When she didn't bring the sauce she asked the busser. When the busser and the server didn't bring the sauce we caught the attention of the manager who promptly brought the sauce out. She ended up eating half of the sandwich. I ordered Fish and Chips. Looked and tasted like Gorton's frozen fish from the grocery store. I was hungry so I ate it. The one redeeming quality of the evening was the Spinach Queso Dip. It was delicious. Advertised as endless Apps, maybe we should have just ordered those. I made the big mistake of using the men's room. It is sadly obvious that the urinals haven't been cleaned in a very long time with deep yellow bacteria growth. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is. Kudos to the manager. She stopped by to check on us and we were brutally honest with her. She comped the chicken sandwich and gave us 2 cards for free appetizers.

The hard roll was heated but tasted old.   It was served with brown gravy that had mushrooms and onions in it. It was the type of gravy you would serve on mashed potatoes.   Disappointing. The French fries were hard and over cooked. We did mention it to our waitress and she did offer to make new ones. The 2nd ones were better.

The bad thing about TGI Fridays is that they they don't make many changes to their menu. I have been so tired of the Jack Daniels sauce concoctions that they constantly promote as the greatest meals of all time.... I do like the wonton appetizers and the free chips and salsa. Recently, however, it seems that they have pared down their menu, but the choices that they left us with are underwhelming, to say the least. They offer a drink called the Junebug drink and I always order a large. It consists of Midori, rum, pineapple juice and who knows what else, but to me, it is like I am drinking on a tropical beach, each time I have one. As a side note, I noticed that they serve Malort. If you haven't yet, try a shot! Lately, we have been eating later in the evening in the bar area. Depending on how late in the evening it is, the bar can be a little loud and boisterous, or quiet and clique-y. We've received good service, regardless, but at ""clique-y"" times, just be aware that you'll probably get the ol' up and down lookover. It feels to me that you get better service in the bar area. I don't know if they give each server too many tables out in the dining room, or the servers don't care about/notice their customers, but we get the general feeling of being passed over when we sit out there.  While not our favorite place to eat, Friday's works in a pinch, like on a weeknight when all the other restaurants are closing and you just don't feel like Denny's or Greek family style.
