0,J D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,99,1.0,2.0,2012-02-05,Slow service and mediocre food.  Typical chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16?start=20,,,,,
2,Marc D.,"West Mifflin, PA",0,9,,1.0,2012-05-07,"Don't bother, awful service with no compensation. Food tasted like it was microwaved. Will not go back to that applebees, I'll like West Mifflen applebees though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16?start=20,,,,,
17,Britney C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",173,256,1905.0,3.0,2013-10-03,I stopped by here just to get a Caesar salad and meet my sister for some drinks. It wasn't busy tonight so I was happy that I wouldn't have to wait or squeeze through the large crowds.  By the time I got to the restaurant my sister had already ordered her meal. She got the shrimp and rice dish which I thought was very bland. The rice was cooked pretty well and the shrimp too but it just tasted like tomatoes nothing special.  I ordered a Cesar side salad and my hubby got the Blondie dessert dish. Both were pretty good I finished all my salad and I had a small bite of his Blondie which taste like a vanilla brownie. It wasn't 9 o'clock yet so I didn't get a chance to take advantage of the discount appetizers and drinks specials but I still managed to order me a long island. It wasn't that strong which is what I prefer but it tasted a lot like lemonade as opposed to ice tea. I do like how they updated the place and I don't really have any bad things to say about it but it is just a typical run-of-the-mill chain restaurant. most of the food sometimes does taste like it came from a microwave package. I guess it's what you can expect from a chain place although there are some better Applebee's but this one just happened to be the closest to my house.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
10,Susan T.,"Monroeville, PA",79,419,861.0,4.0,2014-05-08,"Not a big fan of big chains.  But sometimes you gotta go with the flow. This Applebee's, in Penn Center, is crazy wicked busy for lunch during the week.  And they are great at moving people through to get as much of our lunch money as possible. So that means service is great.  I've only ever gotten salads here and they have always been flavorful and as presented in their commercials and menu. The fact that they openly support the men and women in the military is a plus for me and makes me want to support this chain a little more.  Oh yes, and they also support the America's 911 MC ride.  Thanks for that, too, Applebee's - I'll try and return the favor more often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
22,Joe M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,,1.0,2014-06-09,I've never been to a restaurant quite disorganized than this one. From the moment I  arrived the wait staff seemed to be very flustered. A lot of complaining from the servers about how many people were in their placed in their sections and bickering. It's very distracting and obnoxious when customers are trying to eat. The service was very slow considering my drink order wasn't even taken for 10 minutes after I was seated.  Food was average for this type of restaurant.The most distributing behavior was when the manager corrected a server on the floor. People were walking past and I even noticed it since I was sitting near the kitchen and heard every word. Very unprofessional. One would think you'd pull that person into a room but apparently that's not how this Applebee's works. Won't be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
11,Jennifer G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",100,411,180.0,3.0,2014-06-19,"More like 2.5 stars.  Not the best Applebees I've been to but not the worst either. They seem to have some strange policies in place.  If you order car side to go after 8:00 they make you go into the restaurant.  They also won't seat until your entire party is there even if your entire party is two people and the restaurant is fairly empty.   The servers were fairly unprofessional.  At one point our server shouted over our table to the bar tender about something.  I suppose that sort of thing happens when the oldest employee that evening appered to be under 30 years old.  Not that people who are young can't be professional, but this crew certainly was not. Service was also fairly slow.  Often I had to ask more then once for either more water or a side of sauce.   Food is typical of any Applebees.  As long as you go expecting chain restaurant food, you won't be disappointed. The best deals are to go after 9 and get half off of a nice selection of appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
16,Jean G.,"Verona, PA",47,81,2.0,3.0,2014-08-28,"It's Applebee's. Let's get that out of the way right now- it's a chain, the food isn't gourmet, and if you are expecting to be blown away, you will be disappointed.  That said, the food is good and the server I had on Monday was awesome. It's a shame I didn't catch his name, because I'd request him. He was attentive, friendly and personable, and patient with my party's disorganized ordering process.  I was there around lunch time, and it was busy but not packed. Everything was clean (including the bathrooms), and everyone I encountered was friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
19,Jennifer B.,"Monroeville, PA",39,9,,1.0,2015-07-10,"We have gone here often in the past , today's visit will be our last visit. The prices have gone up, the portions have gotten smaller and it seems the quality of the food is not as good. Four of us dined this evening, 3 ordering steaks that had no flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were bland as well. On top of all of that, we went early to beat the dinner rush and the service was HORRIBLE. We had to ask for silverware after the food came, our drinks were never refilled and the waitress never asked how anything was. Time to find a new go to place, because this one is DONE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
7,Brenda W.,"Monroeville, PA",211,577,835.0,4.0,2015-09-28,"A consistent chain with a menu that leaves me with many options that takes me a moment or two to decide.  There are so many that are colorful with veggies and so many that seem healthy.  This pleases me very much. It was lunchtime and they have specials in which you can choose 2 from different categories for prices by category.  My husband chose that option and had 1/2 a grilled club sandwich and a chicken Caesar salad and I had the crispy chicken salad. We were both satisfied with our choices and finished every bite. Service was good, quality of food was great, prices were fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
15,Sarah F.,"Albany, NY",30,24,,1.0,2015-12-02,WOW. Walked in and waited for fifteen minutes and never got seated! ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. Can't comprehend how that happens.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
14,John M.,"Murrysville, PA",1,34,2.0,1.0,2015-12-12,"Our first visit to this new Applebee's restaurant. First was disappointed that they do not use any apps for reservations.  However in hindsight I don't think that they'll need it... Based on my first visit I doubt that they will be very busy. As always my first litmus test in my ordering a nice Guinness draft... Nope ... Not only no Guinness, but no dark beers on draft.  Strike 1 Found a nice looking shrimp Thai salad... And asked about soup... None that I cared for, so I asked for chilli... Nope ... No chilli... Strike 2 Wife ordered a meal and a side salad... A lengthily discussion ensued due to the fact that they do not have any common dressings ... Finally got the honey balsamic... Little did we know that it really didn't matter... We never got the salad! ... Strike 3 When our meals arrived I would have loved my wife to have taken a picture of my face... In the large shallow dish was the smallest $11 salad I've ever seen... It was about 5 inches in diameter... And an inch deep... With 6 shrimp.  About 8 forks and I was done. Wow... Strike 4 The waiter didn't ask if we would like dessert, and its just as well as we couldn't wait to get out of the place. Have to add the fact that of the 4 flat screens that I could see... 2 displayed nothing... Broken? ... Don't know... The one that I had the best view of had kdka news on ... How entertaining...  Another funny thing that I'll remember... While waiting for our food... And that salad that never arrived... We had been sitting for 10 minutes with 2 glasses of water...  The waiter stopped by and asked ""how is everything?"" ... I replied that the ice water was great.  My wife said that my reply was mean... I told her that I disagreed... If I wanted to be mean I would have told the waiter that I ordered ice water with lemon and didn't get the lemon. Another disappointing restaurant in Murrysville... Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
20,Kathleen L.,"Seminole, FL",0,72,3.0,1.0,2016-01-07,"The last time I went in we sat at the bar for an early light dinner. A ""regular"" apparently didn't like someone that came in. She tried to get everyone to agree with her. This went on for a long time. Bartender must have been friend of hers because she allowed this chaos to continue. Very uncomfortable situation.  No decent beer on tap and the mixed drinks are way overpriced for the quality. Did I mention the food was substandard and our meals came out separately ......and cold?  We both agreed that was our last time. Then we received a gift card for Christmas. Re-gifting that for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
9,T P.,"Penn Hills, PA",0,53,60.0,4.0,2016-05-28,"I recently returned to have a lite dinner with my friend after a year plus hiatus, well let me say I should have returned sooner! The new menu is well worth any amount of waiting time. I've since returned (apx 4 days later) for lunch, and was also pleasantly surprised. The new menu provides diverse options from grilled salmon, shrimp Thai salad, to lamb and and more. All plated wonderfully to please the eye, and the flavors didn't disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
18,J L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",25,31,5.0,4.0,2016-07-07,"Was never a fan, except for the amazing blondie brownie dessert. My visit yesterday was pretty good. The server was friendly, and very accommodating to questions, requests etc., I have multiple food in tolerances. In the end I had a plain cheeseburger without bun and plain sweet potato fries. Both were very good. Burger was a bit small but cooked right and clearly very fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
5,Paul P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,118,23.0,2.0,2016-10-06,"How hard is it to get an order right? Is it possible to get a food order served on a plate commensurate in size to the food being plated? If you are notified that the food delivered is wrong, is it too much to expect an apology, and not hear ""I've never actually looked at the menu"" (sly look, wink, wink, nod nod...like it's some funny inside joke). There's a reason I've not been to an Applebee's for years...nice to see that some things just never change. The food was passable, my rack of ribs jammed onto a too small rectangular plate with broccoli and the wrong kind of fries (ordered the garlic fries, not plain), the waitress displayed not a care that the fries were wrong, and quite frankly I don't do lemme fix it - get it right the first time...that is your job. Corporate culture, staff training...fail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
13,Greg G.,"Monroeville, PA",0,1,,2.0,2016-10-19,"6th time. 1st time horrible meal. Brought wrong order to guest, my pork chop was cooked 2 death. Not edible . Did not comp my dish.

12,Leah R.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,5.0,2016-10-22,The other night we went in 15 minutes before closing. We had just flown in from Arizona and Applebee's was one of the few places still open. They reassured us that it was alright for us to come in so close to closing time. Manager and server were very nice. Great service overall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
6,Food D.,"Champaign, IL",24,36,10.0,1.0,2017-05-29,"My 12 oz sirloin was at least 4oz of fat. Gross. Pathetic, really. Also pathetic, someone from the kitchen delivered food to another patron. The patron asked a question, and the kitchen attendant answered the question while walking away, making zero eye contact. Poor product. Poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
8,Alexandra G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",71,4,,5.0,2017-06-13,"We had dinner at this location tonight. I was having a terrible time with anxiety when I came in for dinner this evening. Our server, Erica, made me feel instantly at ease. She offered happy hour drinks and appetizers while we waited for the rest of our group. My watermelon margarita was perfect. When our family arrived, we quickly got appetizers and drinks. Erica was great with our picky eating requests and with our seven year old boy. All of our food was great. We had a rare steak and and a well done steak on our order and both were perfect. That is impressive. Erica checked in a bunch of times to make sure we were ok. It was a great experience all around. We chose Applebees because we had gift cards, but now I certainly would chose it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
4,Sherry M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",37,223,992.0,1.0,2017-07-27,"Last night was the worst take out experience I have ever had. Applebee's in Monroeville, used to be an okay chain restaurant that you knew wasn't great but was convent and always knew what to expect. We loved the take out from Olive Garden and thought to try Applebee's. WHAT A MISTAKE !!  It was easy to order online and I truly expect something much better then what we received. It was cold and horrible. Online order said 20 mins to pick up and we left in plenty of time to make sure everything was hot when we got it home.  We ordered the Stir Fry Dinners, one Beef and one Shrimp and a tender basket with fries and Mozzarella sticks. Okay I didn't expect much for those the sticks and I wasn't disappointed was exactly what I expected. I son couldn't finish the fries. Fries I guess are the worst thing to order out they don't travel well.  The orders came in huge boxes that made everything so unappealing. and COLD. A smaller box would have helped in the appealing factor. I receive more in a Chinese take out order then, that they gave.  I don't recommend and will never order again from Applebee's  I will continue with OLIVE GARDEN !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-pittsburgh-16,,,,,
3,Scotty V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,82,,3.0,2017-10-05,"This place is ok. The servers have always been really great, except once, when the dude was a total idiot. Food is consistent and good.
