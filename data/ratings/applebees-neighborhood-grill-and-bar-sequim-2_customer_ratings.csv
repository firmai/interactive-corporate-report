I was speechless...I know her slightly and had no idea she had a problem with me. I certainly did not expect to be attacked by a Applebee's employee while dining in their restaurant. My companions were shocked. They began to call for the manager loudly. An Assistant Manager came, I was embarrassed and upset so he paid for our drinks and we left without eating. I called the Restaurant Manager the next day and discussed the situation with her. I was called back by the Regional Manager that afternoon. She assured me that it would never happen again, that everyone was very sorry and that what had occurred was absolutely not acceptabe behavior for an Applebee's employee. I was told Lauren would be severely punished...and led to believe that she would be let go. I was asked to return as a customer by the Regional Manager, who stated that my business was important to Applebees. I did return about a month later with the same friends, we ordered our drinks before our meal...and again Lauren delivered them to us! It was obvious she brought our drinks to intimidate me, she was curt and rude. We were all shocked and uncomfortable to see her at our table after our last experience. We again left without eating, determined to avoid another scene. Applebees has lost four customers over this fiasco. Whoever made the call to retain an employee like Lauren, who literally attacked a customer verbally without any provocation has lost our business for good.

14,Joan V.,"Sequim, WA",50,3,,1.0,2017-03-17,"Gave Applebees a try last night.  Been there before, its always hit or miss.  Last night will my last though.  I must say, two times before food wasn't good but at least service made up for it. But last night was a total failure on their end.  We were sat, and my father watched the waitress visiting with her girlfriends one both down.  Totally ignoring her new table.  Then when she finally broke away, STILL did not approach us but went back to the kitchen for a tad. She finally came up to our table, we gave her our drink order, hot water for myself, beer on tap for my dad.  Took awhile to get the water, and possibly 15 minutes for the beer.  My dad could see the bar which was not busy at all, but the bartender was too busy chatting at the bar with someone to notice an order had been placed!  When my dad questioned the server her comment back was, ""I know, I will give her the stink eye"".  Five minutes later he had his beer.  Now for the dinner, I had a salad which was okay, dad had a 6oz steak which was cooked correctly at medium BUT, it was incredibly tough!  Dad took his first bite, and chewed, chewed and could not even get through it. (And he has great teeth by the way).  He had to remove it from his mouth and place it on the plate.  Next cut and bite, same thing!  I told my dad his 6oz steak will be a 4oz at looks like.  Our  waitress finally comes up to see how things are.  I'm half done with my salad.  Dad told her the problem and she left quickly to get her manager.  Over 10 minutes later, I had to get up and find the waitress to ask where the manager was?!  She states, ""oh, I told her, I will tell her again"".  The manager came to our table and noticed what my dad had not been even able to chew through. 90% of the steak was tougher than leather. Of course she apologized, asked if they could fire another or offer something different, but we were done.  Dad couldn't eat it.  She offered a free dessert.  That's when I had to ask the manager myself, ""you are going to comp this right?""   Oh certainly she stated.  Although I feel if we had taken a free dessert she would of been happier.  And so, as we walked out the door, I looked over my shoulder at my dad, and his words were, ""goodbye Applebees, never again"".  And those were EXACTLY my thoughts too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
8,Robert V.,"Lafayette, LA",0,7,,5.0,2017-03-20,"Great experience at Applebee's tonight. Food was terrific. Had the chicken wonton tacos (crispy and awesome), boneless hot wings (moist and not at all nugget-like), steak quesadilla (cheesy and great). My wife had the tortilla soup which also got 2 thumbs up. Service was nearly perfect (empty plates could have been cleared earlier). Dale was friendly and attentive. Interior was clean and had a good vibe. Was about 75% full (arrived around 5:30). Almost didn't come because of the bad reviews. Very glad we did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
9,Kellie D.,"Mount Vernon, WA",9,10,,1.0,2017-09-05,"Crappy service, waited 10 minutes to get menus and then sat for over 30 minutes waiting for food in a quiet restaurant. Everyone around us was complaining about the service, also. When the food came, my hubbys fries were cold and greasy, a burger with nothing on it.  My salad was sitting in a pool of water.  The plates came out 5 minutes apart, when we finally flagged down the waitress and asked for condiments for the burger and told her about the fries, she took 10 minutes to bring the mayo and fresh fries out.  By that time the burger was cold.  We were never checked on, never asked if we needed anything and sat with empty 'ice tea' glasses.  The ice tea was so weak that it was really just water with a bit of color.  We are done with Applebees!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
6,Joni H.,"Chinook, WA",7,7,4.0,5.0,2018-01-09,"Last time we come here.  Walked in and greeter was great, went downhill after that.  Food tepid, server kept disappearing, no refill or even asked if we wanted one on our drinks.  Cold food is inexcusable.  In fact I will probably never again go to an Applebees again due to this experience.  Ok changed from 2 stars to 5 due to great customer service after contacting main office, Renee took care of problem and will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-sequim-2,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
