Cin L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,52,43,4.0,1/21/2013,My brother really likes to go to this place when he goes to the city to visit. Oriental salad for him. Buffalo chicken salad with no beans for me. Pizza is magnificent. We normally share.  One star down: Staff is young. Not always attentive. But food is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
Amy R.,"Saint Paul, MN",308,1266,1214,1.0,8/1/2010,"Terrible experience here. Eaten at CPK a couple of times, but at different locations.  The food was alright. I always play it safe and go with the Thai Crunch salad, so that's never an issue.  The service however was unacceptable. We had a different server bring out our food. I asked whether or not this was the Thai Crunch salad . She heavily sighed and snottily remarked, "" is this not what you ordered and rolled her eyes"".  It wasn't the correct salad. I explained to our server that it wasn't and how rude the other server was and she replied, ""that's just how she is"".  Manager was nowhere to be found. Just ridiculous. I understand people have off days, but check the attitude someplace else that's not dealing with the public.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
Abe M.,"St Paul, MN",154,332,114,3.0,9/7/2012,"This place was better then I thought.  I came in saying I wasn't in the mood for pizza, yet it looked so appetizing on the menu, that I ordered the BBQ Chicken Hawaiian Pizza.  I ate the whole thing.  I was stuffed after wards.  It's good to indulge every now and then, or at least that's what I tell myself.  I will probably come back to this place to try some other non-pizza food that looked tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
William S.,"San Diego, CA",3,92,28,4.0,8/3/2013,"Fantastic salads with creative varieties and choices. A bit too expensive for what I received, but delicious none the less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
kyle t.,"Maple Grove, MN",215,357,130,3.0,9/15/2009,"Good pizza with a little of a yuppie flair.  This is a nice little place to stop while shopping and sitting down for a glass of wine and a pizza. The pizza is good and you can really let your taste buds guide you to something out of the ordinary. I wouldn't put this quite as high as say Punch or Pizza Lucce but it is a good pie.  Worth the trip, but take advantage and try something out of the ordinary.  KT",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
Ruby B.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,25,,4.0,8/1/2011,"Have eaten here twice now. For the record, I'm gluten-free and NOT loving it. Eating is more of a chore now and eating out is really tough and disappointing. Having said that, I have been pleased with both of my recent trips to CPK. I have gotten the Peach Salad (yummy) and the gluten-free Hawaiian pizza, which was really, really tasty. Gluten-free pizza is hit or miss (with emphasis on the miss) so I wasn't expecting to like it a lot or go back again sometime for a second visit, and I was wrong. It's a little on the expensive side for the atmosphere/quality/taste but I'd go back. Servers were friendly both times and service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
Traci A.,"Saint Michael, MN",35,97,1,4.0,11/27/2008,"This is a chain, so it's consistent. It's pretty good if you like unusual and non-traditional type pizzas. If you're into authentic Italian pizza, don't go here. Then again, if you're into authentic Italian pizza, don't go *anywhere* in Minnesota. ;-) This place has some good specialty pizzas like Thai peanut, bar-b-que chicken, etc. The crust is pleasant. Decent wine selection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
Guya I.,"Minneapolis, MN",16,148,,1.0,7/15/2009,"Yuk.  This is a chain that sucks.  Super hungry, needed a quick bite.  Ordered first a Spinach Artichoke Dip....no flavor, like Muck out of a bucket.  Searching for salt, and chili- even chips were stale. Then came the over dressed salad, which had no flavor at all. Yuk. Where is Gordon Ramsey when you want him? then the Pizza...one would think the big oven would make it have a nice flavor crust....Limp wrist, cardboard, lack luster sucked. No flavor at allllll.  Sucked!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
Jen B.,"Minneapolis, MN",95,195,4,3.0,11/10/2008,"It didn't blow my socks off, but it was pretty good.  I ordered a white pizza and was very happy with it.  I don't know that I will rush back, but I wouldn't be apposed to the idea either.  It was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
Joy V.,"Hennepin, MN",2,16,,4.0,8/27/2009,So what if it is a chain.  The food has always been good and the variety has been fun.  Great salads!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove
