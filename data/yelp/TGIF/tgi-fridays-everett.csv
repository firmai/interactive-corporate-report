Tashombe H.,"Cambridge, MA",22,101,235,3.0,11/29/2017,"The Korean boneless wings were cold. Not even room temp. The sauce was good tho. The peach sangria was fine...not too sweet.   The flat iron steak was medium well-ish as requested but it lacked any flavor and was room temperature at best.  Mac and cheese was good not great and was hot actually. The addition of cheese on top helped to elevate it a bit.  Mashed potatoes were also room temperature and just ok. I added on 6 crispy shrimp for 4$.  They were horribly over cooked, rubbery and also room temperature.   The French dip sandwich was described ad ""decent"" but i didn't try any. It was served warm tho.  The fries were also just ok and not hot. Our server, Mike, was really good, pleasant and attentive. He kept the meal from being a complete disaster.   3 stars ALL go to Mike.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Saachi F.,"Revere, MA",0,24,8,1.0,12/18/2017,"This was a regular spot for us since it was a decently priced chain restaurant in the area. But our last visit put us off here for a very long time. I ordered the quesadilla with just chicken and cheese. Not only did they get the order wrong, but they got it wrong twice. It was the same mistake twice and a really ridiculous mistake at that. There was no cheese. Literally, cheese is in the name of the dish.  I was so disappointed and didn't even bother to ask for them to correct it yet again. During the same meal, my husband's burger was so rare, the middle was cold to the touch. When he asked them to fix it, it came back well-done. I doubt we will ever go back, unless something we really LOVED comes back on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Becky B.,"Marshfield, MA",75,196,118,2.0,12/17/2017,"We come here on a fairly regular basis. Usually, the food and service are ok. Today, however, the food and service were what I would consider poor. We were one of the first customers, so it wasn't busy yet.  Our appetizer took a long time to come out. Then my husband and I got our meals before our friend. We ate at least half our meals before his food came out. My quesadillas were soggy and burnt.  The manager brought out our friend's meal and sincerely apologized for the poor experience. He said he would adjust our bill. A few minutes later, they brought our more of our friend's meal they had forgotten!!  We will probably come back but hopefully next time is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Matthew C.,"Salem, MA",16,6,,2.0,11/19/2017,"This was a pretty bad visit overall, which echoes many of the sentiments already here. There was an extremely large party (40 guests!) seated before us which threw the entire restaurant into crisis mode. The servers seemed to be doing everything they could to mitigate the situation. Everything was delayed, even things that shouldn't be, like glasses of water and our chips & salsa. We sat for over 45 minutes with no drinks and no food. When the food finally did arrive, it was overwhelmingly sub par. Mashed potatoes were lukewarm and crusty, steak wasn't evenly cooked, portions were small, parts of dishes were missing completely. We received a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert but it doesn't really matter because I wouldn't go back, at least to that location. It would have been a nice touch to have at least a couple of the dishes comped. I ordered a Manhattan, which was good but if I'm splitting hairs, it lacked a garnish. A cherry would have been appreciated. I also ordered a southern chicken sandwich which was very small and lacking the avocado and sauce. As a result, it was rather dry and I was thankful for the pickles and tomato for a little bit of moisture. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Huyen L.,"Boston, MA",80,13,10,1.0,11/5/2017,"This place totally sucks. It used to be good when I was little- food and service wise. Came in on a Sunday night, the hostess looked like she didnt have the care in the world and didn't even greet us. She kept looking around constantly to see if there's a table available. She then told us to follow her but the table wasn't even ready yet and lead us back to the waiting area. I got the Jack Daniels chicken and was SOO disappointed. Mash potatoes was mediocre, the broccoli tasted like mush, the size of my 2 chicken breast were like the size of my palm. Is it just me or did TGIF downgraded their portion sizes? Either way it wasn't even good cause it was soo dry.  The staff looked like they didn't want to be here. I understand that working with customers can be annoying at times but at least fake it. There were tables around us that were messy and not cleaned up from prior customers. Oh what a lovely view to look at while eating my dried chicken breasts *roll eyes*. The only reason why I'm giving this review 1 star is because of our waitress, Dorothy. The blonde girl with the ponytail that's always smiling, friendly, and super upbeat. She took care of us throughout our time there and kept checking in to see if we needed anything. She's awesome! Everything else is just terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Amber F.,"Melrose, MA",0,5,6,1.0,12/30/2017,"Terrible, avoid at all cost!!! We had to leave because it took so long and nobody even came to our table. Not to mention the hostess tossed the menus down and didn't even say a word. Awful restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Lauren D.,"Boston, MA",0,2,2,1.0,10/21/2017,"To start off a late 3:00 lunch, my partner and I received two glasses of water filled with black debris. I didn't notice said debris until it was in my mouth. I'm not super picky and I get that accidents happen so I asked for a new glass of water after telling our waitress. No apology, but I got some fresh water so nbd.  We ordered two burgers and an appetizer. The appetizer came out in about 15 minutes and was great! We then waited for our burgers... and waited... and waited. 45 minutes after we received the appetizer, our burgers came out.  The medium burger my partner ordered was well done. We're talking hockey puck on a bun well done. My turkey burger was cooked fine, but all of my lettuce was slimy and past wilted... like the lettuce you forgot you bought two weeks ago for salads sitting in the back of your fridge.  Our waitress acknowledged our wait unprompted and said the manager would be by to get us some free desert (no thanks) so we left the food as is and waited. The manager was very understanding and allowed us to only pay for our appetizers.  I'm a five second rule raw cookie dough eating fiend, so food safety isn't really something I prioritize, but the lack of care for the quality of food and customer experience is glaringly apparent at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Addie M.,"North Chelmsford, MA",114,221,107,1.0,7/28/2017,"I think the manager (Steve?) is  the rudest person I have ever encountered in my LIFE!  This restaurant was a disaster. We literally came in at 8 and didn't leave until 11! 3 hours for bar food in a fast paced environment is NOT Cool. We didn't have a three course pre fixe meal and no one drank.. so why?  They forgot our food on FOUR different occasions. FOUR! And it wasn't the server it was the kitchen. When my nachos come th only thing that was on them was jalapeños. No salsa, no cheese no queso, no nothing! I walked up to hand it back to the manager and he rolled his eyes took my plate and said we'll just make another one.   THEN he sent the server to the table to tell us we were ""86d nachos"" because they ran out of cheese. Oh, so the kitchen felt it was appropriate to just bypass communication and send me out Tostitos chips with jalapeños and expect me not to realize? Funny. Eddie was our server and he was so on top of everything. He tried so hard and would run to our table every couple minutes asking us ""did you get this, have you gotten that, is everyone good on drinks"". Poor thing just has a terrible team for management and kitchen.  This location was NOT up to par. Bourbon salmon at least tasted fabulous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett

The only thing worth getting on this menu is the jack Daniels burger period the rest of there food sucks !

Elsa G.,"Revere, MA",0,7,,1.0,11/3/2017,Very bad returned food and so did table across  Twice they returned idk what happened to Fridays  But food horrible damm shame,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Christina S.,"Amherst, MA",3,13,,1.0,9/6/2017,"I went to Texas Roadhouse tonight for dinner and as I was driving through the parking lot I caught a glimpse of TGI Friday's. It brought me back to my first and last experience there and although that was 6 years ago I am finally ready to shed some light on my experience.  We sat down on a Saturday afternoon and we were greeted by our waitress. I don't remember her name. We've been calling her Julie for the last six years but I'm not sure if that's her real name. Anyways, we sit down and it's pretty full in there. No wait, but still you're average busy Saturday afternoon at a chain restaurant. We sit down and she brings us over waters and then leaves for about 15 minutes.  We don't have any silverware on our table. Just waters and plates and some napkins. She comes over after the 15 minutes of disappearance. She asks us what we want for an appetizer. We order some fried string bean thing that was just blah. Not only was it blah it took about 25 minutes to come out. Like... you're frying string beans? What does that take 5 mins and I'm sure it's a popular dish so I'm sure they make it in bulk. Anyways, moving on.  We order our meals which consisted of a burger, potato skins, and one of the salads with chicken on it. Easy and quick enough, right? Wrong. Our meals took over 45 minutes to come out. Like Fridays I'm sorry but are you kidding me the potato skins come from the freezer for petes sake.  Waitress delivers our food and doesn't give us utensils for about 5 minutes and when she does come back with the utensils my friend asks for the sour cream that was supposed to come with his potato skins... she brings it over 20 minutes later after he's just about finished eating and she throws her hands up in defeat and says ""I'm sorry I just got so busy I didn't know what to do"" ......... it really wasn't even that busy. Like this girl just disintegrating into thin air every ten mins and we wouldn't see her for long periods of time. Who the heck knows what she was up to.  So all in all I spent a whopping 2.5 hours at Fridays on this lovely Saturday afternoon. In fact, the table next to us had two parties seated and finished in the time we spent there. I'd like to thank you Julie for making a lasting impression of TGI Fridays in my brain for years to come. Hands down worst service I've ever had at any restaurant ever. Years later we can't even help but laugh. Thanks again, Julie, my friend missed his grandmothers birthday party because of your poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Adam G.,"Malden, MA",89,192,165,1.0,10/18/2017,"As far as the national restaurant chains go I think TGI Fridays is one of the worst. The service in this location is particularly bad, especially at the take out window. I waited for about 10 minutes at the host podium with no one to greet me. I waited another 20 minutes at the takeout area with no one to greet me. The guy who helped me was nice but what the heck is up with the macaroni and cheese I received? Every time I've come to TGI Fridays I have ordered the baked macaroni and cheese and for some reason today they cut corners and gave me disgusting Kraft macaroni and cheese w melted cheddar on top. Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. I called the store to complain three times and nobody picked up the phone. Whatever part of me liked this restaurant chain for some reason is never going to order food here again. TGI Friday's is a running joke because experiences like this are typical.

Corin B.,"Everett, MA",49,12,4,1.0,7/8/2017,"I came here on Friday night with my boyfriend because I had a gift card. I do actually like the food but the service was awful. I don't nitpick at all and I probably let 99% of things go because I also work as a server and know how tough it can be but our service was the worst I've ever had.  We ordered drinks and a combo app plate and just wanted to work on that for a while and eventually put in entrees and food to bring home. Once the apps came and she asked if we wanted to put in more food. We said we would work on that for now and put it more stuff later. That was it and she never came back. She didn't check on us not one time more. She eventually came over after we had been done and we're sitting there looking around. We just ordered dessert at this point because it was getting late and it was taking so long. She took our order and immediately brought over the check. We hadn't even gotten the dessert yet. So now we weren't getting food to take home. She never cleared any of our plates for us and the high top tables are small enough. She only came back to ask if we were done with the check. I gave her the gift card and that was it. She dropped it back off. No thank you, have a good night, absolutely nothing.  I still even left a good tip because I try to give servers the benefit of the doubt and hope it was just an off night but it really was awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Arielle A.,"Woburn, MA",181,8,,2.0,8/4/2017,"We normally like a chill spot like Fridays, but after waiting 30 minutes for waters and drinks, cold and Luke warm food, drinks that didn't taste right or were poorly made, salad that took almost 1 hour, we realized that this spot is just not a place we will be returning to. Our waitress was sweet, but extremely slow and just unable to multi-task well. Risk coming during the slow peak times of the week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Sasha M.,"Somerville, MA",149,141,219,1.0,5/28/2017,"I will never ever go back here again. My boyfriend and I came in for an early dinner (around 4pm) and right when we walked in there were 3 workers at the hostess stand. I think 2 were servers and 1 was the host. Didn't greet us with a smile...just kinda stood there with blank looks on their faces....I went up to them asking for a table for 2 and they blankly looked at each other and back at me for a while before one of the guys was like, ""i guess I should clean a table"" and walked off....and the girl was like ""It'll b a few minutes"" with NO sympathy no niceness in her voice at all. ALREADY that annoyed me....if you are at the host station, you are the first point of contact that patrons get. Why are you going to be so rude to people? It was like they hated their job and didn't care who knows it. Ok....Decided against leaving because maybe the food will be ok since I was very hungry. Was seated....our server seemed nice, but she definitely was super slow even though it looked like a full house of servers and not many tables seated.....It took us nearly 15-20 min to even get our drinks....and when we ordered food, my boyfriend's food came out fine....Mine however was ALL wrong. I specified that I would want my rib eye MEDIUM RARE. I made sure to say it slowly and loudly so she understood. My steak came out WELL DONE. It's funny when the steak is overcooked yet my mashed potatoes were only warm....how in the world??? So i had to let her know they cooked it wrong....and she said she will bring out another one. Mind you, the whole time this was happening, another table had been seated, given drinks, food, and their server checked in on them a few times. The manager came over to apologize for the steak....he was very nice and seemed very sorry. I let him know about my other thoughts upon first arrival, and he said he will talk to them. I hope he did, they definitely seemed like they don't care for authority figures at all.  Anyway, my next steak came out....I cut into it, it was pink...more Medium than Medium rare, but definitely an improvement. I was really hungry by this point so I just ate the part that seemed medium rare....So at this point, my boyfriend's food has been long gone so he's just watching me eat at this point. Our waitress seemed like she was confused most of the time, and seriously, there was NO crowd.....there were more servers than tables filled.  Overall, everything was terrible except the fact that the manger came over to apologize. That was it. I will never go back to this location. I used to work in the service industry for years and the level of service and how unprofessional everyone was....appalling. There was a spot in the front of house that all the servers would just hang around....shouldn't it be in the back of house so all the patrons don't see congregations happening.  I've had plenty of good experiences at Friday's...this is by far the ONLY and WORST one ever. I will not give it a second chance. This is it, folks. I really needed to get all of this off my chest because it was such a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Kelsey L.,"Boston, MA",95,11,,3.0,8/21/2017,"Went with my boyfriend on Friday around 2:30. Waiter was slow and wasn't paying attention to what we ordered and gave what I got to my boyfriend, a little thing I know but I think as a waiter you should pay attention to your customers. Didn't really seem like he liked us or his job. Hostess at the front seemed bored, didn't welcome us to the restaurant, or wish us a good day when we left. Overall: food is average, typical chain restaurant food. Service, wasn't great. If you're planning on spending more then 50$ or so I'd take your business elsewhere. Not worth your time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett
Chris P.,"Boston, MA",121,454,2083,3.0,6/26/2016,"Came back here for brunch recently to try the new brunch menu. Came with my mom. We got the bacon bucket ($5) for an appetizer, I got a strawberry banana smoothie ($3.89) and the chicken and waffles ($13). My mom got the bourbon steak and eggs ($15.50) and a coffee ($2.79). The total was $40.18 but because of a BOGO brunch special it was reduced to $29.08.  All the food was made perfectly, but the kitchen kept messing up a simple thing: the syrups. The chicken and waffle is supposed to come with this spicy chipotle syrup, but the waitress went back twice and both times she ended up bringing back regular maple syrups. I wasn't going to ask a third time. Aside from the syrup thing, everything was perfectly made, although our server was in a bit of a sour mood. But hey, we all have our off days. Overall the brunch menu was fantastic and I'd definitely come again for it. Glad that I finally found a TGI Friday's menu change (and there have been MANY) that I actually like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett

Logan F.,"Revere, MA",0,4,,2.0,4/29/2017,"We come here all the time and usually they're pretty good but today has been nothing but problems. 2 out of 3 meals we ordered were wrong: an overdone burger and somehow they forgot cheese in our chicken and cheese quesadilla. Okay fine, they refired our food and we sat hungrily awaiting it. Second try came out and the burger is overdone again (whatever, I ate it) but they forgot cheese in the quesadilla AGAIN. How is that possible, cheese is basically the foundation for a quesadilla!! There were 2 ingredients: chicken and cheese, and they forgot 50% of them...twice. They sent the manager over who offered to take items off of our bill but she was not at all professional or reassuring about the situation.

When we got one she was mad petty and rude. When the food came my fries were dry and cold. And may girl who had pasta add mozzarella and the mozzarella cheese tasted like spoiled milk were she almost through up at the table and had to hit the bathroom. I was more worryed about my girls health after that cuz after her stomach was hurting.

Jeremy M.,"Somerville, MA",152,6,,1.0,8/30/2017,"So as I sit here and wait even more for my chicken quesadilla I think think I'll give a review, I mean ...I have the time. Me and my girlfriend went here for some lunch on a slow day and BOY was this the worst experience I've had here (and I've come here a lot over the years). Our waitress was Gianna and she was the worst waitress I have EVER had....I waited 10 minutes for a coke along with my girlfriend who waited the same. We sat 20 minutes for a quesadilla that I can HONESTLY say she didn't even put in along with my girlfriends food as well due to her talking so damn much to her friends that were sitting behind us. I understand if you're pretty excited to see your friends or friends friends that come in and you've been acquainted before ? But you have a job to do. Gianna didn't bother telling us she didn't even put our orders in or anything (mind you she only had 3 tables as well) she just kept walking by us and having her conversation with the table next to us. We sat and watched all the other tables getting their food while she just kept talking her friends ear off.  I finally got my one appetizer after 20 minutes with my drink just full of watered down coke sitting at the bottom of my cup waiting to get a refill, then 5-10 minutes later my girlfriend finally got the words ""so you're sandwich is being plated now and should be out shortly""......didn't know it took 25 minutes to prep a chicken sandwich on a slow lunch time ? Finally I got my refill after my second round of appetizer but it took for me to put my cup way away from me and her walking by the table about 10 times for her to realize that's what a waitress job actually involves.

I got the bacon cheeseburger as usual,  but they had a new cheese sauce as well. Our appetizers were amazing, however we were sadden yet too hungry to complain about our cold, barely melted cheese.

My cousin and I decided to grab a bite before catching a movie, it so happens this was the closest place.  As soon as we walked in we were seated. We were seated near the doors where we had requested to not sit. However, we let that go.  As we were trying not to let that go we couldn't. There was a party behind us of foreigners who seemed as if they had never been to a restaurant before. They were bashing cups and jumping on each other and swearing. This to us was enough. We had asked the ladies who sat us to move us. Still, she did not want to move us. To top it off we had a horrible server who payed NO attention to us unless she was bringing our food. The food was horrible. Nothing expect dessert filled me up.  And the cherry on the ice cream of this experience is that I am 18 years old and I did not get asked for an ID to drink LQ. My cousin who so happens to be 24 ordered drinks for her and she did order two, but the waitress assumed that I was old enough that she offered a shot.

Susanne I.,"Medford, MA",82,7,1,1.0,10/31/2016,"This place has really gone down hill! A friend and I went for dinner here at its Everett location on Oct 15th. We ordered the flatbread appetizer, the cheese on top was not melted at all. But we didn't complain about it. I had ordered a Cosmo-rita after taking a few sips I noticed a huge fly in it. They told me they would get me a new one but can't take it off the bill because it's against the law in the state of MA. Then we got our food and my friend's chicken was raw inside! The waitress wasn't surprised when we told her, she said they've been having that problem a lot lately. Yuck! So my friend got something else and they took it off the bill. The manager also gave us a free dessert or app coupon for next time.        I came back 2 weeks later on Oct 29th (not even thinking) with a different friend. My friend almost swallowed a big piece of plastic she had in her spinach!! It was flat and about an inch and a half long. My friend was freaking out, so the waitress came over right away and apolozied and took it away for a new one. Wish we took a picture of it!! The manager did not come over right away. He came when he brought the new food and didn't seem too apologetic. Actually it seemed as though we were inconveniencing him. We wanted to know where he thought that plastic came from and he said maybe from the spinach packaging. By then she had lost her appetite. He only took that meal off the bill. Our bill was $107 still due to our appetizers and drinks and my meal.       It's really unfortunate because this was one of my favorite spots!!

At first I thought it was great that they finally implemented online reservations, which put me ahead of everyone else waiting but once I was seated, it all took a turn for the worse. Not only did the restaurant have a musty smell to it, it was also visibly dirty. The floors looked like they hadn't been swept or wiped in a while...and don't get me started on the bathroom. To top it off, after unraveling my utensils, I immediately noticed the knife was dirty and had remnants of someone else's food crusted on it. Thankfully, I didn't need to use it but it totally took away my appetite and from that point I didn't trust any of the other dishes sitting in front of me.

We waited patiently as we were told there would be a table available ""soon"". We noticed that a large party left and assumed we would be seated shortly. We were seated at a table with 11 chairs all while the section that would have seated us comfortably was being used as a hangout spot for the employees. When we asked to speak to the manager she was disgusting and rude. She didn't seem to care that we had waited close to an hour with 3 kids in our party and that we were being crammed into 11 chairs.

We also asked if he could turn the music down.  He said no problem but didn't turn it down.  had to ask again later. Drinks came quick.  We asked for chips and salsa (we were also using one of the coupons they send us every 3 months) Husband wasn't very hungry but ordered something to go and I ordered a salad.  That was at 7:10 and we'd already been there a good 15 minutes.  Again, a SLOW night.  At about 7:25, we asked about the chips and salsa we never got and he said ""they should be out shortly""!  Wow.  they came a few minutes later.  So now we're still waiting for our food and it's 7:45.  Finally I said to the bartender ""please also make mine to go"".  A few minutes later at 7:50, out comes the food and of course mine isn't to go so I very nicely told the young lady delivering the food that I had requested it to go.  She got very nasty and said ""Well I didn't know that""!  Then as she was walking away she turned around and gave me such a dirty look and disappeared with my food.  If looks could kill, I'd be dead.  I was honestly afraid she'd spit in it.  Next thing you know the ""manager"" comes out and asks us was it because of the long wait for the food that we wanted it to go and we said yes.  We also reported the nasty person that delivered our food.  She basically says ""sorry about that"" and leaves.  Then I have to flag down the bartender AGAIN to pay.  he has no clue what to do with my coupon and continues to take orders from people.  then he picks up my credit card that he left on the register and disappears to talk to the manager I guess.  Comes back several minutes later finally with the bill.  Based on the reviews I'm reading here, slow service seems to be a trademark of this particular TGIF.  They need new management ASAP.  What started out as a quick trip to get a bite to eat and a drink turned into a fiasco.  To make matters worse, when I opened the salad when I got home, it looked like garbage.  It was like that nasty person poured salad dressing all over it and squished it down.  It was inedible and  I was honestly afraid to eat anyway it so I threw it out.  The manager here needs to be fired and they need to hire competent customer service driven people.  I honestly hope the owner reads this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=20

This disgusts me, I've never worked at a restaurant where food from employees was never not thrown out that night if not eaten. When we called them back and told them about what had happened, the lady tried to tell us it was Cajun seasoning.

The Mac n' cheese bites were off the hook - the cheese sauce was very filling and it was a bit on the salty side, but nonetheless, delicious. The beef skewers came with a pita bread and cooked probably medium well; very juicy and tender. The pork tacos had a hint of spicy and I felt it was a bit juicy perhaps due to the cole slaw on top?

Tayla P.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,82,11,1.0,2/20/2013,"If i could give this 0 stars i would. first of all: when we were seated by the host it took TEN minutes (yes TEN) just for a waiter to come over and ask us what we would like to drink. all i wanted was a glass of water.. so i ordered and my bf ordered a coke and they came out pretty quickly thank god.  while waiting to order, we saw a couple come in the door and there was no host to seat them. then another group came in and lined up behind the other couple.. then another.. there was a line almost out the front door before a host came to seat them! i would have left it that were me. (note that this was a random tuesday night at 9pm.. the restaurant was more than empty so i dont know where the host was or what she was doing but it was not busy at all) we ordered our apps and food which went well; however...  i ordered the chicken caesar salad. (the balsamic chicken i think its called on the menu) and i order a salad at EVERY SINGLE place i go to. no matter what. i love salad. i eat at least 3 a day. i love love love them. ANYWAYS... this salad was THE SINGLE MOST DISGUSTING THING I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE. i have ordered salads before at other places, and may have not liked them, but i always forced myself to eat it because i am not one to waste food and also because i do not complain to waiters and/or send food back. i just dont do that, thats not me. but anyways.. i physically could not eat this salad. the lettice and toppings were fine.. but the DRESSING.. omg it was HORRIBLE! and waaay too much of it and idk what the taste was, but it was GROSS and i even put salt and pepper to help spice it up a bit but it did not work. i had about 4 or 5 bites and i was done. my bf even said to me ""YOU are not going to finish your salad?!"" because i honestly cannot remember a single salad where i have left anything left on my plate. honestly im like a rabbit.. i eat EVERYTHING off the plate no matter the salad. so this was a big deal when i couldnt eat it. it was too gross.  we will never be back to any tgi fridays ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=80

My friend and I had to leave and we asked for our entree to get boxed because it took just so long. Waitress looked pissed off and when we finally go our food, it took her forever to go and take my card to pay for the meal. She came back saying it was declined at least 10 minutes after! I asked her to try again because i just used the card before coming, and sure enough, took her another 10 minutes to just come back again. She was just toying with our patience. Such a simple task and it was before 6pm on a sunday, not even close to busy. Two stars because the wedge salad was good, and the kitchen does a great job with their food.

Daniela L.,"Somerville, MA",1,30,1,1.0,5/23/2012,"Very disappointed. I went there to give it a try. I did not want to have a full meal, wanted something lighter or smaller because it was past 9 pm. My options then would be combining two of these: soup, salad, sandwich. I was worried that the soup would most likely have MSG and not made from scratch, if not canned soup. So, I opted for a salad with sandwich (forgot the name). The waitress could not understand English well and asked if I would like less blue cheese on the salad and I said not, that I wanted everything I was entitled to have in this order. The salad was basically a quarter of a small lettuce cut as a whole piece with three table spoons of dressing on it. Quite frankly, I could barely see any blue cheese, imagine if there would be less blue cheese than usual. The sandwich had one slice of tomato, white bread (not even a single seed or whole wheat), two thin slices of cheese, one leaf of lettuce and some ham, not smoked, not honey-mustard, just ordinary ham. I can definitely eat way better at home. My husband ordered chicken with rice and it was greasy and you could easily see the oil at the bottom. At the end, the waitress brought us a container to go and a plastic bag and left it on the table. The sandwich is still standing in the fridge and I suspect is going to remain there.

Lea C.,"Alexandria, VA",39,288,138,1.0,12/12/2010,"I've been going to Friday's for years. When you're from the Midwest, shit like this is the norm. I think this particular Friday's is the worst one I've ever been in. I probably come to Friday's a couple times a year now that I live in Boston. I heart the green bean fries and loved the stroganoff that used to be on the menu (but sadly is no longer). The bf and I made the trek out here from Boston to do our xmas craftapolooza supplies shopping, were super hungry, and tend to avoid anything with ""Texas"" in the name so we ended up at Friday's.  Apparently, coming through the door of this Friday's means you're transported to New Jersey. In a bad way. Everyone else dining in this establishment was wearing a sweat suit, too much eye make-up, and a bump-it if they weren't letting their horrifically-behaved children climb the booths and kick the back of our seat. The food at Friday's is the same everywhere, so there's no need for comment on that. Our waitress could have cared less about our order. I asked no fewer than 3 people and no less than 3 times for an extra wasabi ranch. Then regular ranch was brought, which necessitated asking a 4th time to get it right. I was about done eating by then. It was loud and the lights kept randomly dimming. There was a spill on the tile with no sign that I slipped on and almost took a dive--right in front of a randomly-seated police officer who remarked how slippery the floor was over there. WTF, seriously? How about cleaning that shit up before you get sued. I don't think I ever got a water refill. Basically, the service sucked. Also, there were a lot of random shitty staring contests going down. So, if you look like a reject from Jersey Shore casting and you want to pick a fight with some teenage skank who looked at you the wrong way, then this is the place to be. Also, if you want to be in the company of other bad parents so that you don't look so horrible by comparison, come on down and let your kids write on the walls with Sharpies and throw silverware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=100

Chrissy H.,"Portland, ME",180,328,116,1.0,1/17/2007,"Normally I wouldn't offend my mouth by putting TGIF food in it, but there was a wait at Texas Roadhouse and we were starving.  So we opted to sit in the bar area where there are numerous t.v.s. We thought this might distract us from the tacky decor of the place. Unfortunately, the bar area smelled... well, like a bar. A dive bar. (stale beer and dirty mop water.) The waitress was nice enough and promptly took our drink orders (a coke and iced tea.) We perused the menu trying to find something that might not make us ill. We decided on the 3 course meal menu. I ordered a garden salad, chicken fingers and Oreo cake for dessert. The salad was icky. It had the white part of ice berg lettuce, a couple slices of cucumber, cheese, some croutons and a tiny little dollop of balsamic vinaigrette. Not the veggie goodness I was hoping for. The chicken tenders were pretty basic and the fries were alright. The cake was better than expected except for the yucky iicing. My boyfriend went with the 3 course combo as well. He ordered the fried macaroni and cheese which was actually pretty tasty. He also got a half slab of ribs that were pretty dry and bland,and he ordered the Cinnabon cheesecake for dessert which was not bad. I have to say that the 2 best parts of the entire dining experience was that the ice tea was fresh brewed (I hate the tea from the gun) and they gave us these awesome wet naps that were so big and soft. You can even put them in the microwave for extra umph! Our bill came to just over $30 before tip.

I also ordered shrimp and broccoli and it too was a small portion. Only a decent waitress has courtesy to stop and ask if I'm all set or get someone to service me. The worst experience I received is when we- my family and I- were in a big group(10 people) to celebrate my siblings graduating HS. Service was extremely SLOW and I consider myself patient; it took them awhile to get our food. And  even a couple sitting near us shared the frustration of slow service. I worked in a restaurant before as a hostess and if service was expected to be slow, we are courteous and tell the guest or apologize. When the hostile waitress finally brought our food, she forget about the utensils and had to remind her. And then, she brought it back angrily. One of my cousins got steak and it was extremely small, as if it made for a child to eat. We left the money under the plate so she could search for it,lol.

When we brought up our long wait to the hostess 30 minutes ago she said it would only be 2 minutes. Are you kidding me they are so full of it here. We even have a 7 month old baby with us. This is absolutely the worst service I've received anywhere. They totally misled us regarding how long this would take. I will never come to this location again. Do not eat here! Worst ever!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=60
Damien S.,"Boston, MA",2909,1678,3712,1.0,6/28/2012,"Shit lightning can't strike twice in the same place, right? Her craving for those abominations of our last visit (Sesame Jack Chicken Strips) had us swinging by begrudgingly, and hoping for better fare. Better? Hardly. Fare? Outlook not so good. The new pretzel twists with craft beer cheese dips are base-drenched sponges that suck up oily cheese melt and the rest of your appetite. Guess we should have listened when the server's reply to ""Are they good?"" is ""A lot of people don' like them."" Thanks, salesman. Had the pleasure to battle through my equally soft and soggy burger, slathered with the same abysmal cheese dip as those hellish pretzel dough, a few fried-til-mushy jalapeños and pickled ones. Craft nothing; crap everything. Sadly, this won't be my last venture to do eat at a Fridays. She loves the Sesame Jack too much and I love her on the same level. We both agree, however, that this specific Friday's had absolutely nothing going for it.

Lauren D.,"Tewksbury, MA",11,25,3,1.0,12/14/2015,"The food at Friday's has never been great. It's only ""ok."" We came here for dinner because it was near where we were running errands. The hostess and server both explained the ""endless apps"" promotion to us so we decided to go with it. What they didn't mention is that it is a per person charge. We had no idea we were each paying for the apps otherwise we never would have ordered what we did. We asked about it and the server was polite but still didn't accept responsibility for not clarifying. The apps were good (entrees were bad), but we were left with a bad taste in our mouths for having to pay so much more than what we were expecting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=60

The price is average and the service is good.  The servers are attentive and very friendly. Just before I was to finish my ice tea, my server already had another one ready for me.    Good late night place to come to when everywhere else is closing up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=60

The wait was very very long for our burgers and when they came, they were burnt beyond recognition.  The waitress acknowledged this and took them away to be replaced with new ones.  The ones the came to replace them were also charred and disgusting. So not cool. The waitstaff was pretty good, though. They took off all the food and only had us pay for the drinks and apologized. But it was sad that we couldn't get any food because they can't figure out how to use a silly grill top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=60
Lauren E.,"Boston, MA",28,301,5,2.0,11/23/2011,"Wow. I've been to TGI Friday's before plenty of times, and this is the first time I've had extremely below average service.  My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken pot stickers and spinach mozzarella flatbread. We waited forever for just our appetizers. Not to mention they brought us the wrong order - fried mozzarella instead of pot stickers. So I had to wait more, and by then I was starving. My dinner ended up coming out two minutes after I finally got my appetizer.  I asked for an extra set of napkins and never got them. We waited about 15 minutes until we were clearly done before we were able to flag our server down for the check and to wrap our food up. There was just too much waiting around in general, and we spent an extra half hour in the restaurant than necessary; a larger party who came after us ended up leaving the same time as us. I'd go to T.G.I. Friday's again, because the food is decent...just not this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=60

Almost 10 minutes after my food arrived to get utensils to eat with ... This sucks..

I have to this particular location a few times over the years.  A specific time November 2007, I had vowed would be my LAST TIME HERE. We had THE rudest, meanest, snarkiest waitress EVER.  It was a traumatizing experience, horrible.  Anytime, someone would say afterward that incident I would decline my invitation there.  I went on a whim day-date in July 2009, I got food poisoning and an intestinal parasite from here that the Reading Dept of Public Health determined that this is where I got it from. Now, a friend of mines sister actually works here so yes, I have been back.. 2011.. I suppose it's the every two years thing and well because I haven't gotten sick here again to date and I don't have to subject myself to a bad-day waitress and I can say I want a certain person that I know, it's alright.  I'm not making it a habit to come here but it is what it is.

Any food establishment with cockroaches is immediately reduced to one star, regardless of how good Angry Orchard drafts are, or how convenient it is that they stay open later than Texas Roadhouse next door. Seriously. Roaches? I've never had the pleasure/shock/horror of seeing them live and in action in a restaurant. Granted, it was the bathroom, but let's not split hairs when it comes to vermin. I prefer my restaurants totally roach-free. Creepy crawlers aside, the service was lackluster: the bartender spent plenty of time chatting with a server at the far end of the bar while we gazed at her through our empty glasses. The place was truly filthy in all aspects. The only upside for me was the cider drafts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-everett?start=60
Drea W.,"San Francisco, CA",23,59,10,2.0,4/27/2013,"T.G.I.F. kinda fell off! I haven't been to T.G.I.F. in over two years. I thought it was a good idea for a date and I to go here to get a bite to eat and drinks. Overall, the experience was ok. I think our waiter made it better. We ordered appetizers: The 3 in one platter (not sure if that is the name). We chose: Potato skins, pot stickers and the Garlic Parmesan boneless chicken. -The potato skins were DRY IS HELL! -The dumplings were pork so I didn't try them but my date said they were good. And the GARLIC CHiCKEN is one of the main reason why I would come again. Pros: -I ordered the alcohol mango lemonade and it was STRONG! oohwee... -For my entree, I ordered the grilled Salmon with mixed veggies and Jasmine rice. It was REALLY good! The only reason I am giving this location 2 stars instead of three is because the potato skins were SO DAMN DRY (no exaggeration). Possibly because I ordered them with no bacon? Actually, I change my mind. 3 stars.

Ash A.,"Medford, MA",13,65,19,1.0,7/5/2015,"Worst service I've ever had. It was nearly empty for 6pm on a Friday night and we were seated immediately. It took 10 minutes for anyone to come over to greet us and take our drink order. The server for that station came and went to other tables nearby and never even looked at us. I stopped a hostess walking by and told her our server hadn't approached us yet. She took our drink order and walked away. Finally, our server showed up and took our food order. Appetizer came, and no drinks. Then he says the bar is backed up. There's hardly anyone there! When the drinks came, mine was the wrong drink. It wasn't a big deal so I kept it. I waited long enough for it anyhow. I ordered a Caesar salad without chicken. My salad shows up covered in tomatoes. Since when is there tomatoes in a Caesar salad? There were no croutons. The dressing was dripping off my lettuce there was so much of it. When the bill came, my salad was $11 and said chicken Caesar salad. I pointed out to him that my salad was literally lettuce and tomatoes and it wasn't even what I wanted and he said there was no side salad price and there wasn't a price without chicken. But the garden salad is like $6. I got less on my salad than a damn garden salad has and had to pay $11 for it. He didn't seem to understand.
