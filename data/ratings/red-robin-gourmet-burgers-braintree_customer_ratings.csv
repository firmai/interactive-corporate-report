39,Ni C.,"San Francisco, CA",188,9,3.0,2.0,2015-10-27,"The host and hostess were very friendly and welcoming. I ordered the fiery ghost tavern double and substituted my fries for the French onion soup with an additional charge. The burger was great, but my French onion soup was VERY VERY salty!!! I asked my friends to taste it and they described it as if they were eating a spoonful of salt. I kindly told my server this and she had the audacity to tell me that's how French onion soup supposed to taste like.... Um... Ive had plenty of French onion soups and none of them has the salt concentration like this one. Then she told me that she'll tell the cook, I was expecting the manager to come over and talk to us... I'm not sure if she ever spoke to anyone about it but no one came and I ended up not touching the soup. My server saw the full cup of soup, didn't do anything about it. And I still had to pay for it!  Also, why can't we split the bill evenly with the zoisk!?!?!? Someone needs to do something about this too. I was so happy walking in, but very disappointed when I left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
62,Jay K.,"Malden, MA",40,208,10.0,5.0,2015-10-27,"We just happened by on their opening day, lucky us! Of course it's new so everyone working there is pretty bright eyed and bushy tailed, which I appreciate. Keep it up! The blue ribbon burger was amazing. I got the 2 sauces (a steak sauce and a chipotle aioli) on the side, just because I am a little picky. Good thing I did it, because I am not a ketchup fan and the steak sauce was a bit ketchupy.  I love they way they do the bottomless fries. They give you a sorta small amount to begin with, and the refills are on the small side too. But think about it! How often do you finish ALL your fries? I basically never can finish them all at any given restaurant. This is a smart idea to keep the portions small, less waste all around.  Guinness on tap for my man, always a plus. He loved his all-American patty melt too.  They also had some really good looking desserts, but after clearing our entire plates, we had no room. Next time. Definitely next time.  Oh and my birthday is next month, I'll be coming by for my free burger :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60,2.42,2.42,2.42,2.42,2.42
47,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565.0,4.0,2015-10-29,"""Yay! I'm a fan."", clearly states how I feel about this new burger destination at the South Shore Plaza in Braintree.  Say what you want, I'll STILL stick with the Millbury Red Robin. The interior or this location is ok, but I wish they kept the old interior design used in the Millbury and old Foxborough location. Plus, the logo is new, and not as cool as the old. I came in for take-out which was very confusing at first. I was going somewhere in Brockton, and thought to call the order in on the way there, but the Braintree Red Robin doesn't even have their phone number on their website! Didn't bother, so came in and ordered take out at the bar, as there weren't any signs or any employees to explain where to go (so that should get fixed, as should their website, WITH A PHONE NUMBER!!!). Anyway, Haily, an employee at the bar who helped us with our take out order was amazing. She was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the food (especially as they just opened). Definitely the highlight of my visit was customer service from Haily. She also made sure that my order was put in quickly and made within 10 minutes (WOW! Especially for a new place, where everyone is still learning how to run things). Still wish I could have called it in, but I still like this place, and my burger was very good (as it always is from Red Robin).  Located in the South Shore Plaza, by the parking garage, Lord&Taylor, and DSW.  Overall, 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=40,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998
25,Tracey L.,"Quincy, MA",8,83,162.0,3.0,2015-10-30,"New location at South Shore Plaza, where Legal Sea Foods used to be. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess. They have a cool system where you put your name down and they ask for your number so they can send a text when your table's ready. You can also check where you are in line.  When we got the text, we were seated at the bar, which I wasn't really fond of as I prefer sitting at a table. I think they should ask in advance if it's okay to seat people at the bar. As expected, service at the bar wasn't as quick and attentive. Although the waitress/bartender was nice enough she was was clearly busy. We decided to go with the a small order of buffalo wings (buzz sauce), Whiskey River BBQ and Fiery Ghost Tavern burgers.  The wings didn't come with any dipping sauce. My whiskey burger was pretty good; decent size and filling. My bf said his burger wasn't very spicy even though it had jalapeños in it. The steak fries that came with it were fine, not as crisp as I would've liked, but you can get as many refills as you like. You can get ""premium sauces"" if you prefer something other than ketchup with your fries. I ordered the garlic aioli, which was pretty good.  I think they're still working out some kinks since they just opened a few days ago. We had several waiters stop by with other tables' orders. Overall the visit satisfied my burger cravings. I'm glad there's a location closer to home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=20,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997

36,Jason G.,"Abington, MA",49,163,4.0,3.0,2015-11-13,"We went here for lunch on a holiday weekday. There was a decent crowd, but plenty of available tables. Our son was with us and he needs a high chair. I thought we would be say right away, but the hostess told us there was a 15 minute wait. I looked around at the various empty tables and booths and wondered if perhaps they were sections with no wait staff coverage at that time of day. Instead, as we are waiting I saw another party walk in from the mall entrance and be sat immediately. I went over to the hostess just to check-in and ask if there was still a wait. She said there was still a 15 minute wait and then lied that those people were on the list.  Once we finally got a table, which didn't require a party leaving, since there were plenty of tables available, we got to try the food. We started with the pretzel bite appetizer. It was okay, though they do not give enough dipping sauce. The burgers were fine, but nothing to write home about.  That leads to my other dislike - the on-table ordering/entertainment system. It was perfectly fine until I saw the $2 entertainment fee on my check. It would be nice if they warned you that there's a charge before you use a game on the device, but they did not. Don't put a device on the table, give it the outward appearance of being free, and then covertly charge $2.

Being from California I'm familiar to this chain restaurant known for its bottomless fries with every burger purchase. The new restaurant has a casual sports bar vibe with TVs from every angle and those futuristic tablet ordering systems at every table. I was a fan of the appetizer menu that included good eats starting at $3 with $5 and $7 categories as well. Because your app and main dish shouldn't be equally priced! (Highly recommend the wedge salad for $3, surprisingly was able to split  it with my husband). They had a fun menu of burgers which is the reason we came.

65,Rebecca C.,"Medford, MA",287,110,56.0,1.0,2015-11-27,"Well that was an experience to say the least. I came here with my mother and little sister because my mother remembered taking me here as a child and wanted to share this with my sister. Well disclaimer we came on Black Friday so it was a wee bit busy but nothing crazy. Walked in and were walked to our seats immediately. The male host with glasses tried to seat us next to an aisle and my mother asked to sit next to the wall because she doesn't like people walking into her or having my sister close to a busy walkway. The host told us that he would but the other server of that section just got sat and so he couldn't seat us there. Well the female manager with glasses came over and said it was ok. So we sat down and immediately ordered an app from the computer thing on the table. Our server took a while to come to us and when did seemed to not care. We had to ask a few times about crayons and paper for the lil one. Our app came out. We got the chips with salsa and guac. Well don't bother. There isn't enough of either of the guac or salsa for the chips. As we were waiting I decided to sign up for the rewards program assuming I would want to come back. Couldn't do it on my phone but could on the computer. Well we waited and waited and waited for our food. The lil ones pizza finally came out and we continued to wait for our food. Now I would have forgotten the time if the two tables who came after us hadn't eaten , finished, paid, before we even got our food. The other four top in our row had the server go up to their table and the lady asked about the food and the brunette server looked at her and said yeah it's Black Friday, crazy huh. Shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I feel like the was the definition of a server saying idgaf. I ended up busting out laughing and so did the middle two top table. The server wasn't ours but I couldn't believe she would respond like that to a mother and her two children who as we talked is also a server. Our male server came over three times. I paid the bill before we were done because I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. We waited 45 mins for our two burgers. The male server that took care of us didn't care. Best part what was he could tell we weren't happy but I doubt he wanted to tell his manager considering the burger behind is in a burger was wrong somehow and already had to have the manager over. So honestly I don't plan on coming back to red robin. The only person in that restaurant that I dealt with that didn't piss me off was the female manager with glasses.

Cons:  - It was freezing. I mean I get it. It's winter and it's cold out. But there was a draft in the restaurant and it was cold.  - Presentation of meals wasn't great. Plates were super greasy along the edges.

58,Vaughn I.,"Weymouth, MA",238,2,,1.0,2015-12-29,"A couple of years ago, I went to a restaurant in South Carolina with my mother and her husband at the time. To make a long story short, I'll just say it was one of the most racist experiences of my life, and we left within 15 minutes of being there...However, I think it's safe to say that going to this Red Robin was worse.  My girlfriend and I came in last night, and were very excited as we both hadn't been to a Red Robin in a long time. Like many of the other reviewers have said, we were told there was about a 20 min wait even though there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes to be seated at one of said empty tables. And it took another 15 min before one of the bus boys, named Kevin, came over and asked had anyone helped us yet. It was at this point that we should have gotten up and left. So the continued awful service experience that followed is half our fault for staying at this terribly run restaurant.  A waitress finally came over, and apologized for the delay. She told us that the waitress we were supposed to have was super overwhelmed and couldn't come to help us, so she came to take our table. Throughout this entire night, we heard other waitstaff apologizing to their tables for the delay and saying similar things. It sounded like something she made up, but she was very apologetic so we accepted it and moved on. We ordered our food right away, and also ordered two beers and water. It took about 5 min before she brought us our waters, and we asked about the beers. She said she was just waiting for the bartender to make our drinks and they'd be right up. another 5-10 min went by, and a different waitress brought us our food. We thanked her, and asked her about our beers, and she said she'd go check on them. Another 5 min went by, and we had to ask Kevin about our beers. He apologized and got our beers right away, even though two different servers couldn't. Our burgers tasted pretty good, which was one of the only saving graces of this entire thing. Though of course it wasn't completely ok, since mine had mayo on it even though the menu didn't specify that it would. I hate mayo, so I told our server, who damn near had a panic attack because she didn't know what to do, so she ran to tell the manager. The manager comes over and then proceeds to ask me why I didn't want mayo on it. Ummmm why does it matter?! I'm at a restaurant, and I don't want something on my burger. No questions need to be asked. Any other normal place would have just replaced it immediately. But whatever, I ate it with half of the bun because I didn't want to have to prolong this visit anymore than we needed to. The waitress comes over and we ask for the check, and I also order a milkshake to go at the same time. She comes back with the check and we pay, and then a min or so later comes back with the milkshake that's half empty. Not a joke or an exaggeration. It was literally half empty. So I ask her if they can add more to it, and she looks at it goes, oh ok I guess. As if there was nothing wrong with bringing me a half empty shake. She brings it back, and we waste no more time in getting out of that place. So to sum up this novel of a review: 30 min to be seated in a mostly empty dining room. 15 min for a server to come over with a made up story. 20 min and 3 attempts to ask for two beers to be served. A 1-2 min conversation about why I didn't want mayo on my burger. And a half empty milkshake that apparently isn't a big deal....We'll definitely be back again....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=40,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003

Another problem is that 2/3 of their tables are in the bar and they won't let people with kids sit at those tables, so the bar was half empty the whole time.  There was also a table in the dining room that was open from the time we got there to the time we left, about 1 1/2 hours.

I have very mixed feelings about my experience. I absolutely loved my burger! I ordered the southern charm burger. It was oozing with delicious tangy honey bbq sauce that wasn't too overpowering and topped with delicious candied bacon! That was the only good part of my dining experience.            The first thing I noticed that was off was our waiters..the fact that we had two different waiters who clearly didn't know they were both serving us. And I noticed there weren't too many other diners so I don't know why the service was so slow, even with our two confused waiters. We found ourselves having to constantly use the little electronic device on our table to call our waiter.        The second thing that really bugged me was how dirty the dishes and utensils were. I'm sure even if we weren't sitting directly under one of their light fixtures we would still be able to see how dirty everything was. I would think a new establishment would be pretty good with not grossing out so many new customers. But no lol. I could write my name in the unidentified stains on my plate.        We got the chocolate fruffles for dessert and was once again grossed out. They seemed partially frozen and just screamed ""packed frozen and flavorless!""

No problem, maybe they are short staffed.... But as our meal went on there were employees standing around by the kitchen.  One girl bussed the table next to us because another told her she'd cleaned three and that isn't her job. The first set of silverware was dirty.  The food was pretty good, but the two guys at the table next to us at their meal, paid, and left in the time it took to get our app. Our waiter was nice, but a little hard to come by once we got our food.

The grill chicken was tasty but the salad was limp (edges of lettuce were brown) and the diced onions were frozen and stuck together in big clumps.  It looked like the kind of salad that you would buy pre-packaged but at least those tasted fresher. The girls asked for refills on the fries with more than one waitstaff and the answer was the same "" it being made in the kitchen and its coming"".  If they offer ""bottomless"" fries, would you think that the kitchen is constantly making it  since its not a special custom order.  They ended up waiting 20 minutes and were finished with the chicken by then.    When I asked how did they like their dish since mine was a bust.  The response was ""it was ok but its the kind of chicken that makes you feel yucky afterwards"".  Now, this is coming from girls who loves to eat out at restaurants all the time.

This establishment is incredibly frugal with the concept of bottomless fries.  Instead of serving Fries right away, they hold off until the burger arrives.  This isn't how a Red Robin should be operated.  Every other Red Robin brings the fries to the table as appetizers, similar to how Texas Road house/Olive garden serves their rolls.  This establishment needs to step it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=60,1.92,1.92,1.92,1.924,1.92

I was so grateful for his help, that I didn't say a word about how awful the food was.  Our $7 steak fries barely had any toppings on them and were very underwhelming.  Mac and cheese: just dry noodles with some shredded cheese melted on top. My salad was totally dry lettuce and mostly purple cabbage.  It came with no dressing. The avocado was brown. There was a long black hair in it.  My boyfriend ordered ""the big one"" burger, which in reality was very small. When he questioned our waiter about the size, he recommended that he order the Angus burger next time.   There will not be a next time.  Everything delivered to us was disappointing.

However they must have read them and had a turn around because my last visit ran perfectly.  This was only my second time to a Red Robin, but I was honestly impressed by the menu - for a predominantly burger place the options were endless and looked spectacular! I ordered the really spicy burger (name escapes me) that came with ghost pepper sauce and jalapeños. I was pleasantly surprised that it was indeed spicy since most places that tout ghost pepper are usually meh. I was only able to get 1 extra side of the bottomless steak fries. I love their seasoning and am glad they supply a shaker bottle of it at each table! They also have bottomless steamed broccoli for those that are health conscious, a nice thought. As mentioned, the service was stellar, in fact borderline maybe a little too much. Only reason is that we had 2 servers helping us a time. Maybe one person was in training or our 1st server was at first helping out the 2nd and started us off, but we kept on getting repeat service like ""anything to drink? -no thanks we already ordered"" or ""want more fries? -nah she already came around and is getting it for us."" Honestly not a biggie, better to have more (and good) service than none (or bad) at all.

I honestly thought it was more of a  fast food joint lol, so I was surprised to see it was a sit down restaurant. I went with my family on July 4. I was hesitant about the menu, mostly burgers since I'm not really a burger person, but I got a chicken sandwich thing. Their plating set up for stuff was interesting? The waitress was pretty decent and attentive thankfully. It was a holiday at lunch time so it wasn't very busy, thank goodness. And even though she had a hard time understanding what one of my brothers said (he's special needs), she still talked directly to him when one of us would translate. I wish more people would do that with him. So I appreciated her level of patience. And I saw they do root beer floats so I encouraged him to get one since he LOVES root beer and I wanted him to have a float at least 1x in his life. HE LOVED IT and he was all smiles the rest of the day. (Now every time we go to a restaurant he wants a root beer float lol.) The desserts were odd too. My brother got a mud pie which was bigger than we expected, I got those chocolate stick things which were kinda boring for a dessert so I was a bit let down by it and offered the rest to my family lol. Overall, service was great for us (maybe worse if you go at a busy time?) but the food was kinda ehhh to me. It wasn't anything that would urge me to return even though it's location is very convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-braintree?start=80,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.668,2.16

I tried their bonzai burger once, and it was ok, but I much prefer the flavors of the Bleu Ribbon. My husband has gotten a few different kinds and has liked all of them. I LOVE that they have bottomless fries. The seasoning is so good.  I have also had their Caesar's chicken wrap and their Chucks and fries. Both are fine.  MUCH prefer their burgers.

I like that they have a prosperous loyalty program, and the winning concept of bottomless steak fries. I like the flavored iced tea I don't like the food, unfortunately. Not a hatred - it wasn't bad or anything. It was actually fairly flavorless. Fries are undersalted and cool on delivery. Big Ghost Tavern Burger ($11) is billed as one spicy punch to the tongue hole, yet sits woefully bland in spite of the various promised chiles in the mix. I don't like the sign-up process for the above mentioned loyalty program. You can do it from the pay immediately terminal which sits at every table, ready to distract your kids with cartoons (for a price), your teenager with games (for a price), or your significant other with a button to order complimentary refills (hey, it's free!). As with many tech advancements to help streamline a process, the paper jammed and took six times as long to rectify as handing our server a credit card. Beer and wine on the menu.

Waitress brought roll to manager and took that extra charge off bill.  When waitress came back, I told her how awful the meat was (tried to eat without roll). Both waitress and manager came over and offered something else, but having two fussy children doesn't afford the luxury of waiting again. Manager fully took off of check and gave me his card to come back for a free burger another time. Might have given it a thought until I came home and found a 1.99 entertainment charge on bill. There are tablets on tables that, without notice, they must charge if used. Having children with us, of course they use.  I don't recall seeing anything posted or displayed showing potential charges.
