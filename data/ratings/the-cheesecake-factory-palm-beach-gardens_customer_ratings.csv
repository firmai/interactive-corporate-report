31,Adam S.,"Charlotte, NC",15,361,3.0,4.0,2012-01-21,"Cheesecake is really what you make of it. It can be delicious, such as my half Steak Dianne and half salmon, or fattening and heavy, like my dad's pasta. We ordered guacamole to start, and it was absolutely delicious, I must have had half of the chips alone. Salsa was also very good and mild (you can choose if you want it mild or spicy). In serving our meals, one od the servers (not our guy) actually whacked my mom on the head with her elbow and did not apologize. That's very unacceptable. My meal was half of the lemon salmon and half of Steak Dianne and some mashed. The steak was delicious, and the sauce had bitter and sweet notes. The salmon was above average, I just wished there was a little more crunch on the outside. My dad's fettucini was heavy and he didn't eat much of it, which doesn't happen a lot. My mom and sister also got pasta, which they reported was very good. Cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory is always good, however I didn't love the Reese's, so I might just stick to Red Velvet next time. Service was good, the friendly waiter talked to my dad about SUNY. Overall, I would probably go back if visiting the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens?start=80,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184

There's always a wait to get inside on the weekends even though you have many seating options including : inside (booths, high tops, bar seating, tables) outside (traditional tables on a covered patio, or along the sides of the facility without head covering.)  The hostess staff are very nice people and they give very accurate ETA for seating. This is great if you're catching a movie within the next hour and may not be able to stay for the duration.  I've always enjoyed the factory burger, factory burrito and the drinks. The drawback : the place is expensive, like really, really expensive. My boyfriend and I ordered two factory burgers and two drinks - $65 bill. My eyes almost fell out of my face when I saw the total.

Normally, we go to the Boca Raton location. FOOD (3.5/5): The bread was a little on the tough side - as if it sat too long in the bread warmer.  We ordered some calamari, which we usually love from Cheesecake.  However, the breading fell off easily, and there were so many pieces stuck together that it made it difficult to share without tearing the pieces apart.  I also feel like the portion size was smaller.  I ordered the lunch salad, soup, and turkey sandwich combo.  The soup of the day, cream of chicken, was rather runny and watery for my taste.  The sandwich bread was really soggy, and I'm not sure why.  My brother and father each ordered the lunch orange chicken, which seemed more like the batter than the actual chicken.   SERVICE (4/5): I waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes before anyone greeted me.  While the hostess was busy on the phone, there were other servers who were just standing around.  Eventually, someone asked me if I needed to put a name on the wait list.  Our server was pretty good.   ATMOSPHERE (3/5):  It was pretty loud in the restaurant.  However, it is very well lit (at least in the afternoon - I can't speak about lighting in the evening).  The decor reminds me of Grand Lux Cafe, which makes sense since Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux Cafe are sister restaurants.  Up front, they showcase their cheesecakes, which they are known for.  There's parallel parking on the street, or if you can't find street parking, a parking garage located very close to the restaurant.

We placed our order for appetizers and dinner and that's where things unfortunately went off the rails. Our 2 appetizers (corn tamales and spinach dip) arrived 3 minutes before our main meals. The waitress apologized but there was no clear reason why this happened. Needless to say, we were unable to enjoy the appetizers before the main meals came. Ok, irritating, but not horrible.  However, when the food arrived, my daughter started eating her macaroni and cheese burger with mashed potatoes. It seemed to be ok, but when she dug into the mashed potatoes and took a bite, there was a rotten potato there. Curious why there was a whole potato in ""mashed potatoes"" but nevertheless it was there. My daughter gagged and refused to eat any more of the potatoes. Honestly, it ruined her dinner. The manager was asked to come over and he did. He took my daughter's meal off our bill.  All in all, it was mostly a good visit and would have earned a higher rating, but the inexplicable food arrival time and rotten mashed potatoes definitely spoiled the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
56,Jon N.,"Jupiter, FL",31,64,2.0,4.0,2017-02-18,"I wrote a review 11/12/16 which wasn't very favorable.   I hate to seem like a chronic complainer.   Last time I complained about the food, this time I must complain about our waiter.   When I spend close to $100 on dinner (4 people) I expect to have a wonderful experience food and service.  Wasn't the case this time.  The food was good, the service sucked. We sat outside, our server was David.   We were told David was busy so a waitress (didn't get her name) came over to help him until he became available.   She took the drink order.   My wife asked how much the martini's were.  She was going to get wine, decided to get a lemon drop martini.   The waitress said she didn't know, she would check.   She came back and told us $10.50 with well drinks.   So we ordered one.  Two others at the table ordered coffee.  David finally showed up with all the drinks, no coffee.   Said the coffee was strong, so he made some more.   Finally, just before the meal comes out David delivered the coffee.   Said he tripped and spilled the coffee so he had to go back inside to make more, he was sorry.    The food was delivered, David never came over to check out how things were going.   We had to flag him down because the people wanted some grated cheese.   David said oh, I thought I asked you.   I said, David you have to come  over to the table to ask.   Let me say, that was the last time we saw David until the check.  No refill on drinks.  Never even came around to ask.   My glass was empty, when he came around to see if we wanted dessert he saw it was empty and never even offered.   $3 a pop for drinks and you don't even get a refill.  We get the check I see they charged $12.50 for the martini.   When I asked about it, he said he told the waitress to come over and tell us about the mistake.    Again, I got a sorry.   Really, the waitress quotes us a price and then we get charged $2 more?  Well, I am DONE with this Cheesecake Factory.    I hate to see anyone work for free, so I tipped EVEN  he wasn't worth what I left.   Usually I get great service, I just happened to get stuck with David.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

42,Krishna N.,"Riviera Beach, FL",248,73,173.0,4.0,2017-05-07,"This place is always a hit or miss. Sometimes the food is like wow, this is the best meal ever and other times it's like we'll wish it was better. There's been a few times when I ordered the steak Diane where I was overly impressed with how the sauce was made and other times where I asked for medium well steak and they gave me pretty much medium rare and I've sent it back. That fish for sure has been a hit or miss.  The buffalo ranch chicken salad is amazing. My favorite salad there to order for sure. The salads are so huge here. Ask for dressing on the side though sometimes they drench the salad a little too much for me. But if you like dressing overload then ask for it to be tossed into the salad. The happy hour for food is really good. The food is so cheap and they give you so much for being happy hour. The drinks are nothing special though. My favorite item is the crab wontons they give you ten of them. I like that they have the calorie count next to the food. Some people may not like it but for me it's helpful. I also like to order the Greek salad. My favorite happy hour salad. Big enough to be filling.  Overall I think you have to try this cheesecake location. It's not the best one but it's good enough. You may get that amazing dish that one day so it's worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

When our waitress Kristen approached she was very knowledgeable and very helpful and very patient because my friend and I were deciding on different drinks to order appetizers and meals. Everything our server recommended was great I had a whiskey honey drink my friend had a lemonade alcohol  drink we shared the cauliflower appetizer I had a great California. avocado salad and my friend had the salmon luncheon. Since our server Kristen noticed I had birthday card and present she knew it was my birthday we were too full for dessert but she still brought over a little ice cream with whipped cream and sprinkles and a candle and said happy birthday because she knew we didn't like singing I thought that was very kind of her and very nice and I highly recommend Kristen and I think she should get a raise!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

But when we asked why we had to wait so long for a table, the manager lied at first then she told us that the tables were available the entire time but were not cleaned off yet.  The manager never apologized for the miscommunication/error on their part. We asked her would she at least offer the birthday girl something to make up for the mistake....

41,Alana E.,"Boynton Beach, FL",110,111,35.0,2.0,2017-11-11,"I'm not a huge fan of CF to begin with, I think the menu is overwhelming and food not that great, but every once and a while I go because others want to. So today we got there and had to wait 10 or 15 minutes for a nearly empty restaurant. So we sit down and look at the crazy bible menu, which to me has a whole lot of nothing. I decided on the goat salad, which I've had before and my mom got the warm crab dip. Mine comes out and I swore in the past it had fried goat cheese, but this time it didn't. No worries there mine was good I can't complain. My mom, however, took a bite of her bread and it was literally rock hard and the crab dip was just gross. So we signaled the waitress who came over begrudgingly and asked her if she wanted chips, instead. She sent it back because it literally tasted horrendous and ordered the spinach artichoke dip. So in the interim we are given butter and no bread. Finally, the spin dip comes out and it was good, but you can tell we pissed the waitress off because we got attitude central after we sent her food back. Then I looked at the spin dip plate and there's green stuff on it that in no way represents our order (see pic). Kinda gross, I'm hoping it was just food that rubbed off on the plate and not a dirty plate. Then we waited another half hour before we got the check. In other news, I don't know why I don't learn my lesson, I don't understand the hype except unhealthy people eat here for the quantity, not the quality. And don't even get me started on the service. Too bad, this used to be one of my favorite chains when it first opened..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-palm-beach-gardens,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006
