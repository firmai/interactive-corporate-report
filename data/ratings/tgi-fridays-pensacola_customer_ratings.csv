31,Song N.,"Pensacola, FL",74,96,14.0,4.0,2012-11-12,"I stopped by here for Sunday lunch with my bf. The place was pretty crowded which I expected for a Sunday football day, but we got a table right away which was very nice. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. We started out with some kind of cheese, veggies, and nachos on a skillet that my bf ordered for appetizers, and it was delicious. I ordered the salmon with lobster dish with sweet potato fries and rice; it was pretty good except the salmon was a little too done and dry. I had the brownie obsession for dessert and it was absolutely delightful with the cold ice cream and warm brownie. It was pricey, but I enjoyed the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

I was there last night and over half the place was empty and she had me wait for a table for 15 min, I asked why with all these open tables she explained to ME they only had one server at 630 dinner time, I've ran.into this problem at a few places around Pensacola, I don't understand it. After we got seated the server was rude at first then I explained to her that I don't understand why everyone is so rude, she changed her attitude but the food was awful, cold, chips were old cheese dip cold.. It was awful. I'll have to say the manager came over on his own and we talked he apologized and comp'd my meal that I didn't even touch and said it wasn't normally  like this, which I find it hard to believe and asked me if I wanted dessert. I was thinking I haven't even ate dinner yet..lol so.he insisted me take a.card for fee appetizer or dessert next time. Sadly to say there won't be a next time for me it was that awful. 30$ for some chicken fingers that my daughter.enjoyed:) I just want to find a really good place to eat out here!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

We ordered a round of the house margaritas on the rocks. Our drinks were delivered quickly by the smiling server. We all ordered the spinach artichoke dip to have together as an appetizer. The dip along with some hot freshly made tortilla chips were delivered after a very short wait. I ordered the new dish called Tuna Crisps which consisted of three slices of fine sushi grade tuna that had been seared around all the edges served atop a crisp tortilla chip. The tuna itself was topped with a dab of sour cream and a big dollop of guacamole. Each stack was garnished with a slice of jalapeno. The dishes our table ordered were all tasty and well prepared. There certainly were no complaints at our table!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

But I ordered a pasta, I can't remember the name of it. Though I know it had capers, lemon butter sauce and spinach in it. Now that was a Nast nasty pasta. They took it back and off my bill.

28,Brittney S.,"Gainesville, FL",9,8,1.0,1.0,2014-08-04,"What brought us here was the unlimited appetizers promotion going on. We ordered the tuscan spinach dip and were quite disappointed. The dip literally looked like it had just come out of the microwave and was surprisingly watery NOT cheesy. As for the ""chips"" a few were pretty good but some were extremely soggy and tasted like cardboard. On our second ""round"" the spinach dip took forever to come out (and the restaurant was pretty empty) and it was still cold and half-frozen. Yup. Frozen. I am pretty disappointed that the waiter could not exchange our order or even get the manager out to speak with us. Be even told us that they were having issues with their microwave (microwave? Do they no even cook the food? Is it all just reheated over and over?) We wanted our money back for the terrible food and our waiter said he couldn't that for us. We felt very disappointed and frankly upset that they didn't care about their customers. When we just asked for the bill the waiter developed a snarky attitude and later came back to say ""I hope you guys come back to see us and enjoy our food again"" with a grimace. I couldn't help but to stare at him. Are you kidding me? No apology for the horrible service and quality? Pretending like everything was OK? We reassured him we won't be coming back and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005

When my plate arrived the sides were wrong. My companion ordered a steak medium well. The first steak was medium rare and when they brought the second one, it was a different cut steak and was well done. The manager offered no apologies for either mistake. Also, one of the other servers kept touching his face and then touching plates/napkin/silverware. He had a cold and his noises were disgusting and noticeably done over the food.

10,Brendan R.,"Pensacola, FL",7,6,,1.0,2016-01-08,"Considering the busy Friday night the service was very good but the food was on par with a McDonalds value meal. For $11.50 we got ""double patty"" burgers but the two patties together barely added up to an average burger's worth of meat. They were nearly burnt to a crisp and tasted like grill charr. My BBQ burger had a tiny dollop of sauce in the middle and I had to order an extra side of sauce just to drench the thing to be able to choke it down. We went because we had a coupon for a free entree but I don't think we will go again even if the whole meal is free. Again, the servers were very nice, helpful, and accommodating but we go to restaurants for the food. This food was terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola,,,,,

It's a place you could become a ""regular"" at if you wanted to, or just mind your own business. The staff is very friendly, from the top down. Always greeted by name when I am there. Tell me another chain restaurant that can do that. Food is above average for a chain as well, I usually order a salad which are all very tasty and a great value. Cocktails are very crafty and delicious as Friday's are known for there variety. Bar tenders are very friendly and knowledgeable as well. Wine list could use a little more quality and variety but hey that's a corporate thing so whatever.

We arrived for Friday's brunch and my granddaughter had high hopes for the waffles with bananas after exhausting all of her only two options on the kids menu only to have her hopes crushed when the waiter informed us that since Fridays doesn't sell enough waffles that the waffle maker was removed from the store. No need to look over the menu again since her only option was now scrambled eggs which she might as well have ordered at McDonalds and at least would have received a toy in her happy meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola,,,,,

The appetizer also came our about 2 minutes before our food, but we ordered it all at once so it's not a big deal.  However, what IS disappointing is the food. We got one of the flatbreads and it was $10 for 3 pieces of thin flatbread with sparse chicken but, in its defense, lots of fresh veggies. I ordered the Jack Daniels burger, and all I could taste was grill char.  Honestly can't remember what entrée the bf got but it wasn't anything to write home about, but the mac and cheese he ordered was pretty gross--it's just overcooked noodles in a thick, ricotta-like, not-at-all-creamy sauce that tastes strictly like parmesan. Lots and lots of parmesan.  The bill was well over $40 (with tip, though) and we ordered waters to drink. Overall, service was fine, but the food took a while, and it didn't seem to be worth the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

It was the right amount of spicy where it did not ruin the meal. It even came with two wings on top which was a nice touch.

The tenders were fine but the amount of fries for $13 was down right disrespectful *see picture* I was so upset. My sister asked me not to complain because the manager was really nice to us.
