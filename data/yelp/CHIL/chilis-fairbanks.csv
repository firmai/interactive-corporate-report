S C.,"Fairbanks, AK",10,83,10,4.0,5/18/2011,"This Chili's is on par with every other Chili's I've been to. Our group of four went for some late night munchies and drinks. They had the best mixed drinks I've had in Fairbanks so far and the food was all good. From what I remember, we had: boneless wings, chicken quesadillas, chips and corn guac, and potato skins. Margarita, Grey goose with lemon, and tropical sunrise for drinks, delish. Place was clean, the waitress friendly. I like it :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks

Sophia A.,"Fairbanks, AK",0,4,,4.0,10/31/2011,"Yes, Chili's is just another chain restaurant located in Fairbanks but my experience there was the best I have had thus far. I visited Chili's on October 28, 2011 which happened to be Game 7 of the World Series. One might think that in all the excitement, service might be lacking but it was the complete opposite. I sat down in a booth in the bar area and in less than two minutes my waiter, Chris, arrived and wiped down the table (even though it was already clean). Then, he asked what I would like to drink and also brought silverware and extra napkins. After arriving with my drink (just water), I placed my order. I decided on the Margarita Grilled Chicken, Spicy Garlic & Lime Grilled Shrimp with Steamed Broccoli and Rice. While waiting for the food to arrive, I observed my environment. The lighting was dim but inviting and warm. There were pictures on the wall of a variety of different activities and people that made it feel friendly and home-like. I also noticed the excitement surrounding me. The customers, including young and old, military and civilian, male and female, were locked in on the game as it drew closer and closer to the end. There was laughter and conversation but not too loud to carry on your own personal conversation if needed. After waiting less than fifteen minutes, my dinner arrived. It was served on a white dinner plate with the food neatly and cleanly placed and the portion sizes were reasonable. The chicken was placed on a bed of colored tortilla strips and was topped with Pico de Gallo. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. There were hints of lemon and lime and a good flavor from the sear of the grill. The tortilla strips allowed for a nice crunch. The shrimp were juicy and the spice was not overpowering; they had the perfect amount of heat. The steamed broccoli had a fresh, green, healthy look and was seasoned with salt, pepper, and a light amount of butter. The rice completed the dish. It was seasoned with pepper and had hints of lime and cilantro. It was also mixed with yellow corn. Each item on the plate had flavors that complimented each other very well and had an overall south-western theme. The waiter, Chris, definitely contributed to the great experience. When he first came to the table he was friendly and smiling. He seemed to be in a genuinely good mood and was upbeat. What I liked very much about Chris was that he was not overbearing. He did not check in too little but did not check in too many times; he found the perfect balance. He allowed time for me to enjoy my meal without constantly being interrupted. Chris was also aware of when my water was low and refilled it. Based on a rating of One Star= Poor; Two Stars= Fair; Three Stars= Great; Four Stars= Excellent, I would rate the following: Overall: Three and a half Stars Ambience: Three Stars Décor: Three Stars Food: Three and a half Stars Service: Four Stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks
Q L.,"Richmond, VA",16,456,40,2.0,2/19/2012,Whole experience ruined by the voice of a very loud server screeching at top volume.   I expect a certain level noise when I am at Chili's but I shouldn't be able to hear a server when she is in the kitchen and she's not the expediter.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks
Greg M.,"North Pole, AK",2,8,,2.0,8/31/2011,"Horrible experiences on the two occasions I ate here.  Very slow, inattentive wait staff and the food is less than desirable.  I've frequented other Chilis locations in the past and the Fairbanks Chili's has been by far the worst.  Unfortunately, being in Fairbanks, there aren't many alternatives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks
Chris C.,"Kirkland, WA",1,21,,3.0,3/13/2011,The food is okay. The service is hit or miss tho. Sometimes it's really good and other times its horrible. Ur best bet for decent service is to go at lunch time or sit at the bar or in the bar area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks
Norman D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,10/8/2011,"I have eater there four times and every time is bad.  The first time I order the sliders which should be 4 different little burgers.  It took over 30 minutes; the wait was so long I started to doubt whether or not I had ordered anything!  maybe there was a misunderstanding?  I ask the bartender since I was sitting at the bar and he tells me ""It takes a while.""  I know, I have been in a restaurant before!   When It comes, it's not 4 separate burgers; it is one big burger cut in quarters like a little kid would get.  I ask the bartender what's up and he says, well we are out of the little buns!  Well, how about giving me a heads up when I order the thing?? Next time a Quesadilla Explosion salad takes over 30 minutes and now the manager getys involved and tells me they lost it and when he bringds it he tells me he is not going to charge me for it!  A real manager would not charge me and comp me two new dinners to get me to come back.  These people are slow and rude.  Bar is dirty but so is all of Fairbanks.  On the fascia of the bar itself, right in front of where you sit there are crumbs and food stuck and dried in there.  Worst chili's ever and I like Chili's.  they don't know what ""acknowledge the customer means"" but you have no choices in that stupid lazy town.  At least chili's is non-smoking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks
Kristian J.,"Fairbanks, AK",0,4,,5.0,11/6/2011,"Last night some friends and I went to Chili's to celebrate one of my buddies 19th birthday. We didn't have to wait for a table to open up which was nice and the environment was very friendly. It was relaxing, a little too relaxing, the lights are dimmed in the building which made me feel extremely tired. The service was good, our waitress came to our table every three minutes asking us how it was, it got kind of old after awhile but she was just being polite.  Well we ordered our food and it took awhile, we received our drinks which were good, I got the blackberry iced tea, two of my friends got strawberry lemonade, and my birthday buddy got some hot chocolate. The drinks were spectacular.  Finally our food showed up, it was well worth the wait, i'm not going to lie. I got the honey-chipotle chicken strips as well did my friend who was on his delightful birthday dinner. Another one of my friends got a chicken burger with avocado, the other chose to get mini-burgers which I've had before at Chili's. The honey-chipotle strips didn't taste as well as i'd thought it would. It has a funny taste too it, it wasn't necessarily honey tasting as it was chipotle. I like spicy flavored food but this was a strange spicy. The avocado chicken burger looked delicious, it smelled amazing. He also got a side of cheesy broccoli soup which tasted fantastic, it was by far the best soup i've had at any restaurant. The mini-burgers on the other hand aren't one of my personal favorites. They have onions on it that have a strange texture. The cheese was kind of dry, but it is worth trying. The thing that I appreciate most at Chili's is the corn on the cob that they have. The corn is smothered in butter, some salt is put on it and some pepper. If there was a way that I could only get corn on the cob there I would.  We finished our dinner and our waitress came back and asked us for dessert. I couldn't help but get one of my favorite kind of shakes, an Oreo shake. It was scrumptulescent, no, it's not a real word but it should be. My birthday friend got a peanut butter pie which was pretty good looking. As soon as I got my shake I ate it up. By far the best shake i've ever had in my life. I suggest you go to this Chili's and you will be satisfied. No doubt, no doubt in my mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks
Chris G.,"Conroe, TX",19,62,13,2.0,12/18/2009,"It may be average for Chili's, but an average chain restaurant doesn't compete with unique local fair that you won't get when you leave FBX.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks
Lewis O.,"Fairbanks, AK",3,16,,2.0,12/22/2009,"Typical, one size fits all, chain restaurant serving something akin to Mexican food. One could move the whole thing, building and all, to any other town and have the same experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fairbanks
RON H.,"Sacramento, CA",5,34,,3.0,9/22/2009,"My dad, brother and I came here around August 24, 2009.  This place was really close to our hotel (Holiday Inn Express) and we could walk here very easily but it was quite cold.   This is a typical Chili's chain restaurant found all over the place.  They have a variety of food to select from which should satisfy most people.  My dad and I had the mixed fajitas which come with shrimp; chicken and steak.  Food was good especially when you are hungry and not much was left of mine.  They could give you more tortillas since you only get maybe 3.  I don't think it comes with a salad and the beans and rice were about $2 something extra which I declined.  Boy, living in Alaska adds up a little at a time; maybe that is why I see so many liquor stores???
