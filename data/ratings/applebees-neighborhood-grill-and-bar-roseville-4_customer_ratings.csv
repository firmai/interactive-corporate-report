17,Linda H.,"Saint Paul, MN",368,438,147.0,2.0,2012-07-13,"I must update my review because of what happened the other night.  We have been noticing a decline in service in the past few weeks but this was comical. We were seated....We were seated.........We waited and waited and waited.  After about ten minutes, for a joke, I set the timer on my phone and told everyone, when this timer goes off, if we have not at least been acknowledged, we are leaving. Three different servers went past us several times but nothing.... Timer goes off, we get up to leave...The hostess, the same one that had seated us, says to us....""Have a nice night!""   We all laugh on the way to the car. So sad because this was my favorite Applebees....:(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,
20,Sarah G.,"Inver Grove Heights, MN",17,59,1.0,3.0,2012-07-22,"The first time we stopped at this location I was 9 months pregnant in July and their a/c wasn't working very well. The restaurant was pretty busy, the food was taking a while to come out (we had a large group, so that didn't help either), I was preggo hungry. We were seated right along a wall of windows with the sun beating down. I felt so sick with an empty stomach and the heat, that I left the group and sat at the bar with a large glass of water until the food came. Not a good first experience. We asked the waitress if they could turn the a/c up (before we knew it wasn't working properly), and she was kind of rude about it. (Though, I'm sure she was miserable as well, having to run around back and forth in a hot kitchen serving us food.) We were in the area again though and stopped for a lunch date. The a/c was working much better, it wasn't so crowded, and the food came out much quicker. I think our first experience was probably fluke, and it didn't help our attitudes that we were planning my mother-in-laws funeral. This time around the hubbs and I were able to have a nice conversation without a lot of background noise. The food was quality Applebee's food, and we left without any complaints. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4?start=20,,,,,
14,Ben D.,"Owatonna, MN",348,458,44.0,1.0,2013-02-22,"Yeah yeah I should have known better, it's Applebee's. I normally would not have even wasted my time, and still feel salty over the firing of the waitress a few weeks ago for calling out the bad patron... I digress, my friends wouldn't budge on their want to go here, so I met up with them after work for a drink. Upon walking in I was greeted by the host who was genuinely nice, and directed me to the bathroom as well as their table. When I actually sat down at the table is when I realized just how bad the service was going to be.  There were only a few people seated in our section which was split between two waitresses, and there was an assistant manager that was helping run food as well. It took the waitress over 10 minutes to get me the ordered cocktail (a tall Vodka Tonic), and she didn't bring me a water.  We ordered a few apps, I got a salad, and our other friend got some chicken fingers. I also asked for a water again, which was not delivered. The food was very subpar. The salad was the best thing on the table. The artichoke dip looked slimy, and had almost no flavor, and the pretzels with beer cheese was nearly inedible. The pretzels were just fine in the mustard dip, but the cheese was lumpy, goopy, and filmy. They obviously didn't microwave it long enough as it took about four minutes for it to congeal to the point of nasty on the table.  In the meantime, we had ordered more drinks that again took FOREVER to get to the table. The beer had to be ordered through the assistant manager as our server took a 20 minutes leave of absence from the floor without even checking in with us. The soda's again took almost ten minutes. I would not normally comment on the speed of service, but it really was terrible. After another half hour wait the chicken suddenly appeared on the table, and being as I was not the person who ate it, I can't comment on how it was. But the ordered sauces never arrived either. The entire experience here was awful, and my friends and I all agree, we will not be back. Slow service is one thing, but the uncaring attitude of the server, and the lackluster food really made this our last trip to Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,

11,Erica F.,"Shoreview, MN",4,9,,5.0,2014-10-05,I have been to the Roseville location a handful of times now.  The food is always delicious and hot but I have got to say that I am genuinely impressed at the management.  They truly care about the reputation of their restaurant always going the extra mile to make any slip up right.  A prime example was the other night when my family and I spent the entire day at MOA and we had four very hungry children at the table. The apps took a little long to be out because of a slip up in the kitchen and the kiddos were not happy.  We received excellent commodities and sincere apologies to make up for it. This is definitely my go to Applebee's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,
15,Katie J.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,6,,5.0,2014-12-07,"Always have a good time at this Applebees. Good food, friendly service! I am impressed that I always have a manager ""check in"" at my table.

10,Natascha S.,"Minneapolis, MN",6,3,6.0,4.0,2014-12-29,"I've been to this location probably 10 times (I live close). It's always clean, and the servers are always friendly. I tend to sit at the bar, but tables are equally nice. I frequent the sangrias, which at this location tend to have less flavor than the location in Minneapolis by the U of M. Best app hands down is the spinach and artichoke dip, always fresh and hot with giant chunks of artichokes. Helpful hints: their French onion soup is phenomenal, and good if you don't want too much food. Finally: ask for a basket of fries and ask them to put cheese on top, they will always do it and you will be served a basket of fries with melty cheesy glory (usually cheddar). MOST IMPORTANT: Order a piña colada, blended. It isn't on the menu but it's amazing, they come in the extra large size and they shove tons of pineapple and cherries on that baby.

9,Greg P.,"Saint Paul, MN",23,14,,1.0,2016-03-11,"My friends and I use to frequent this place. But we will most likely not be going here ever again. The table we got sat at was not clean, the person then pulled a towel out that look to be tucked into his crotch area. It took 15-20 min for us to get a server. Drinks came about 10 minutes later, and food was about 30 min later and barely warm. We began to eat only to notice our server was picking their nose!!!! We left what was owed and walked out without finishing dinner. We sent a email, and got a quick response from the so called manager. She said to me ""well sometime people just have bad days"" she said they would make it right. I received a email with $5 gift card. I was shocked, as we had spent over $50 for food and drink! What a slap in the face to a loyal customer. Still grossed out every time I think about it!! Do yourself a favor and do not go here!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,

4,Helen T.,"Lake Elmo, MN",201,179,661.0,4.0,2016-06-14,"Applebee's have been around for a very long time . I got especially excited when they brought one of my favorite desserts back, the chimicheesecake.  This location has been good. Great atmosphere for happy hour and always a friendly staff . They've added a new thing where you can play games or order things or even pay your bill without needing your server . I was a little sad that it seemed to take a long time for our server to come when we chose to call server but it's ok. He was awesome because he was very much on top of keeping our drinks full. My brother got a strawberry lemonade . When he noticed my brother was slurping them down quickly he started giving him 2 cups at a time . Very considerate.  Great place to go to get a happy hour meal and they have Monday burger deals. I think it's Wednesday where you can participate in bingo .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,
6,Kimber D.,"Minneapolis, MN",9,26,47.0,2.0,2016-07-30,"Applebee's is Applebee's, you think they are all the same. WRONG. This one sucks more than average. DON'T GET CARSIDE-TO-GO! They will forget about you and then act like it is no big deal. Went there today and ordered $58 worth of food Carside-To-Go. Ordered it for 12:30pm. Pulled in at 12:29 and waited, and waited......and waited. At 12:45 my husband goes in to check on our food. It had been sitting at the bar the WHOLE time getting soggy in the plastic containers.  I double checked on our receipt and it DID say 12:30pm and it DID say Carside-To-Go with the make and model of my car. The guy (receipt says Jason R.) at the bar was not apologetic at all. My husband explained that we had been there for a while waiting in the hot sun and we were upset about it and the guy just said ""Oh, didn't see it there."" That was it, he completely dismissed him. No apology, no offer to redo the food, no offer of a soda or something cheap on the house or anything at all. I should have gone in with him because I would have asked for the manager, but my husband walked out without fighting about it.  I am not a millionaire, I spent $58 at the establishment today, which I know is not the most anyone has ever spent, but is a lot of money for mediocre Applebee's food. I am disappointed we were treated with such disrespect. Was it because he didn't think he'd get a tip for carryout food? Because we are great tippers (or would have been). Was he just having a crap day? Maybe, but I still do my job properly when I have bad days.  So here I sit, at home eating my cold spinach artichoke dip wondering why I gave them so much of my money. I am sure the food would have been fine and exactly what I had expected had it not sat around for 15 minutes before it was picked up.  Jason R, because of you, I have decided to go to Chili's next time. They have the same frozen food but maybe the staff has better attitudes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,

12,Twin Cities M.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,21,,3.0,2016-11-27,"Had dinner this evening at Applebee's with five friends. The waitress informed us that she was brand new and in-training so we realized that the service might be a bit slow. I asked for Decaf coffee that was to be brought to the table immediately. It never came so I had to ask another waiter who brewed a fresh pot and brought me a cup of coffee that was very good. Had to ask a second time for the salads to be brought to the table prior to the entrees. The caesar salads were decent. Then a long wait for our entrees  - probably 25 minutes from the time that we ordered to the time the food showed up. However, the food was very good and hot. The biggest complaint was the payment method which involves some new technology located at each table. It is very confusing to use and we had to ask the waitress to return to the table twice to help us figure it out. It also was a bit cold when we arrived but warmed up nicely after about 30 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,
2,Dee D.,"Minneapolis, MN",647,47,93.0,4.0,2016-12-19,"It has been a while since I stopped in to a local Applebee's and so I thought I check out what was offered here! Applebee's always have had that bad & grill feel since the bar is in the middle of the whole restaurant. If you have not been to one also expect sports to be played throughout the restaurant in perfect vicinity of the area that you're sitting, so if you're a sports fanatic I can guarantee you won't miss a moment!  The menu has changed tremendously! They now have way more variety than the old menu back in the day! The server that we had was phenomenal! She explained the menu and let us know what her favorites are currently on the new menu! Very helpful for anyone who is indecisive with food decisions. I decided to go with the Create your own grill master! Selecting the 8oz Top Sirloin (added mushrooms +/additional price) with potatoes cheese and bacon along with their house Mac & Cheese (you get to choose your two sides). Usually, I have always had the worse experience with my steak not being cooked properly even when I am asked how I like my meat to be prepared! (For any chain restaurants) This time when the steak came out it was made to perfection! It was cooked to how I was ordered and the flavor was wonderful! For anyone that's curious, I had the medium-rare steak! I for sure enjoyed my time at this Applebee's as the service was great and the food was on point! Hope everyone's experience here will be as great as mine!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,
3,Jessica Y.,"Saint Paul, MN",34,160,214.0,1.0,2017-02-05,"This place has really gone south into the bland menu and ""I hate my life"" servers.   I looked at the menu which has changed in the last few months.  It's trying to look like Chili's offering up meal deals which included appetizer,  entrées and desserts. When everything looks blah.. my friend and I ended up with cheeseburgers. The service was non-existent. The server got our drinks after 10 minutes.. the appetizer came after another 10 minutes from another server.. 30 minutes later..(seriously) the burgers finally arrived.. But the condiments were wrong and the burger cooked wrong.. 20 minutes later the server comes back to see if everything was alright.. we told him both orders were wrong.  He said he'd correct it.   Another 15 minutes fly by.. we figure we should just eat,  pay and leave since the server forgot.  The people to the left and right of us were complaining to the mgr already about wrong orders.. non existent servers.. so we decided that our server sucked.   After we ate.. the server came to pick up the plates and trash. I reminded him kindly that he never got refills, he never fixed the orders. He just said.. ok. Not a care in the world..  We paid,  tipped and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,,,,,
1,Ryan H.,"St Paul, MN",14,60,102.0,2.0,2017-05-31,"I went here for a lunch business meeting recently, and it was everything that I expected from Applebee's.  I sat down with my companion waiting for the rest of our group to arrive, and was greeted like Peter from Office Space.  ""Could I get you a perfect Margarita, a bud light lime, or a Sangria shake?""  I was so surprised as she belted this off coming from behind me that I almost jumped.  I looked at my watch... 11:30... and I thought, well, its 5 o'clock somewhere, but that certainly is a long ways from here.  There were a couple of old bitties drinking cocktails a few rows down, and a group of what appeared to be WWII vets downing yellow foamy domestics, so maybe this is the place the old folks home residents come to get schlitzed. At any rate, I wasn't ready for any sort of adult beverage at 11:30 on a monday morning, especially for a business meeting.  I ordered the fiesta lime chicken, which I think was $12 or $14.  It was the most appealing thing I could find on the menu.  It came out, and was basically a regular chicken breast with some fiesta seasonings and a squeeze of lime on top of the tortillas strips used as decoration, with some dry rice (still with the form from the container it sat in presumably overnight) and beans.  The rice was red, like they added paprika but nothing else.  The chicken was fine, but certainly something I could whip up myself in my kitchen in 5 min for about $2.50. Overall, lunch was fine.  I ate my chicken, and the tortilla strip confetti, rice with 90* corners, and packaged pico stayed with the plate only to be thrown away.  I would recommend that the cooks try to make food that is appealing, not just to fill up the plate, but I know that they just don't care and that Applebee's is going to continue to make dishes that can all use the same basic ingredients.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-roseville-4,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
