Leah H.,"Pierre, SD",16,4,,4.0,9/29/2016,Food was average fair for Applebees.  My steak was overcooked.  The waiter was quick to resolve the issue and bring a new steak out.   The manager came out to insure that I was happy with replacement steak.   I would definitely go here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-watertown-6
Jared J.,"Minneapolis, MN",19,6,,3.0,6/17/2016,Pretty typical Applebee's.   Service was fairly decent and food was standard Applebee's fair.  Not amazing but not poor either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-watertown-6
Jeff H.,"Watertown, SD",0,1,,1.0,4/27/2016,"Service was lousy food was worse, my wife received the wrong order so she returned it got what she ordered and it was stone cold my order seemed like a TV dinner left in the microwave too long dried out half cooked, server really didn't care so we paid for crap we didn't eat and left and won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-watertown-6
Susan B.,"Osseo, WI",0,6,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Service was ok, food was awful. Layout very awkward. We were seated in an awkward table after the host marched us past six open booths? Poor management with a lack of training of the staff is obvious here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-watertown-6
Bruce D.,"Fargo, ND",0,4,,2.0,10/23/2014,"Service and food are okay. Accommodations are geared for young families. Layout of the facility makes it difficult to navigate for senior citizens, especially one's in a wheelchair. Tables are too close together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-watertown-6
Lawrence D.,"St Petersburg, FL",0,16,,5.0,7/25/2013,"My friend and I ate here for dinner and had such a wonderful experience. The manager greeted us promptly and seated us in a booth. When our server took our order we went for the 2 for $20 menu choices. I ate the ribs with rice pilaf and corn and my friend ordered a chicken dish also with two sides. The food was so tasty and fresh and we could not have expected a better tasting meal that night! And the same manager even comped us one dessert which we shared. It was a chocolate cake topped off with ice cream and syrup and so gooey and rich too! We tipped our server and said our goodbyes to the manager who was very accommodating to us. I would definitely recommend this particular location of Applebee's in Watertown, SD and you won't be disappointed at all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-watertown-6
