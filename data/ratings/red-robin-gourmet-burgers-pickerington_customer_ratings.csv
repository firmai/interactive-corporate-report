18,Mark D.,"Columbus, OH",38,74,16.0,4.0,2017-02-02,"Opening week, we are here on Day 2. No surprise that there were a few minor items that need tweaked as the staff gets up to speed. I love the new look of the space it is exactly what you'd expect. Much nicer than the Easton location which is looking a bit dated eve with their somewhat recent remodel.  Had a few issues with the food as it came out, but the staff was overly apologetic and the manager, Jeff was at the table immediately.  Our server Bree was highly attentive and took great care of us.  Food, once the right things arrived, was great.  Not bad for day 2! We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007

6,Steve H.,"Canal Winchester, OH",12,41,10.0,3.0,2017-02-08,"Food and shakes were good. Service on the other hand left a lot to be desired. The waitress took 23 minutes from the time we sat down to come and acknowledge us, another 10 minutes before our order was taken. I would be somewhat understanding if they were busy but it was not at 4pm on a Wednesday afternoon. The people sitting behind us waited so long they called a manager to take their order. Not sure I will return if this is how they provide customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington?start=20,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
28,Emily D.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",47,153,13.0,4.0,2017-02-13,"OK, first off, I adore Red Robin, and I was so happy when this one opened in Pickerington!  The food is always five stars for me. This location I visited twice on opening week, so there were some bumps in service as they were getting things going, but I expected that. I want to give it five stars, but the service is still getting going, so I'm reserving the fifth star. :)  The decor is really fresh and appealing--it's the old Uno's location but it's a totally different look and feel. The TVs in the main dining room do make it sort of loud at peak times, but this would be a great play to watch OSU games or March Madness because of the TVs. When I went the second time I was with two others, and all of us enjoyed our sandwiches (two burgers, one chicken sandwich) and our various sides (French onion soup, southwestern black beans, and the classic steak fries.). I'll be visiting a lot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152
10,Emma P.,"Canal Winchester, OH",65,2,,2.0,2017-02-13,the burger i got was overcooked and burnt. the coleslaw i got was soggy and didn't taste appetizing. overall just a bad experience and will not be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington?start=20,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.952000000000001

1,Rick M.,"Lancaster, OH",48,154,106.0,5.0,2017-03-26,This was such fun. Haven't been to a Red Robin in a while forgot how much I enjoyed them. Burgers are so delicious and always hot and tasty. We ordered the whiskey river bbq wings and yum!! The bbq sauce is da bomb. Underneath those scrumptious wings and onion strings was a bed of wavy kettle chips that soaked up the bbq sauce OH MY!!! I may have to ask for those chips and bbq sauce instead of fries next time!! Honestly folks for a chain it's tough to beat Red Robin they do what they do very well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington?start=20,,,,,

Our cocktails came quickly   The waitress gave us ample time to decide what we would like to order.  My avo cobbo salad was yummy.  Service was pretty good, food was great. My cocktail seamed to be light on the vodka.  I will go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington,,,,,
8,Deb M.,"Pataskala, OH",0,4,,1.0,2017-04-19,Horrible service!  We sat for 20 minutes and no one even made eye contact.  Even contacted corporate and didn't even receive a follow up email.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington?start=20,,,,,
14,Gwen W.,"Columbus, OH",384,1100,2559.0,3.0,2017-04-23,"Tables are waaaay to close. Of course, there's a walkway between all the tables and the booths,so no close-knit between the two. But the tables, well, if you want a semi-intimate conversation, lower your voices.  I haven't been to a RR in about a year. This is a newly opened location (in February) and has a totally different atmosphere, furnishings and decor than the others I've been to. Medium grey walls. Metal ceiling with exposed duct work. Framed pictures spaced around in the walls. A giant take on a lego cheeseburger, fries and shake. None of the bright, bold red tones, and no fun memorabilia all over the walls, here. Each table has a small touch-screen. At least you can pay via it. I chose the Citrus Harissa Salmon sandwich, minus the tempos lemon wedge - too much pucker for me. The harissa sauce was different. A pickled taste. Pretty good. The salmon was juicy with good flavor. I'd get this sandwich again.  This RR is, just, different. Not bad, necessarily. Just, not the family-welcoming, kids get a balloon, open airy space of the former years. Food was good, so I wouldn't oppose coming back, when wanting to stick closer to home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington,,,,,
26,Cassie L.,"Newark, OH",10,14,49.0,4.0,2017-04-29,Long wait. We had to sit in the very cramped bar area. The food was amazing though. We had pretzel bites with beer cheese. I had the keep it simple burger with a veggie Patty. I had unsweetened tea which was good. Service was great. We had our food in a timely fashion too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington,,,,,
7,Jeremy R.,"Northeast Portland, Portland, OR",7,1,,1.0,2017-05-09,Never received our appetizer. Bottom buns were soggy and no sense if urgency to remedy the situation. Ate over half of burger with no bottom bun. Nothing but positive experiences at other locations but we will be staying away from this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington?start=20,,,,,
17,Frankie C.,"Columbus, OH",77,6,2.0,1.0,2017-05-09,"I was so excited when Red Robin finally came to this side of town. I've always had excellent experiences with the Grove City location.  Tonight I ordered online. A simple order.. Turkey BLTA and Sweet Potato french fries. I will take fault in not checking my order before I left the store. I got home to find my fries cold and the cheddar cheese I added to the sandwich was missing. Not a huge deal but I did pay a $0.99 up charge for it. I call back and ask to have it remade. I drive back to the store and pick it up again.  I was disappointed that the manager did not come out to either apologize or offer to rectify the situation. I get home to find that they had given me regular French fries. Once again not a huge deal, except I paid a $1.49 up charge for sweet potato fries. So I call back a second time. Told the manager (Tom/Todd) I'd just like my money back at this point.  It was almost an hour of back and forth since my initial order. I drive back a third time. Which I shouldn't have had to do. The manager should have personally checked my second order and brought it out to me. Instead of allowing the bartender to handle it. It was unprofessional and not fair to her.  Is any of this a big deal? No, not really. For me it's just the principle. The lack of customer service is off putting and disappointing in an establishment. Especially one I've received great service from in a different location. I could understand if it were a weekend or busy. It was a Tuesday night at 9 p.m. Needless to say I won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington,,,,,
5,Robert J.,"Columbus, OH",8,4,3.0,1.0,2017-05-12,"My wife and I went to Red Robin last night for dinner.  The experience was horrible.  We walked in behind a group of 4 and while we were waiting another couple walked in behind us. The other couple stepped to the side so they could clear the doorway.  When the hostess finished with the group of 4 instead of asking who was next she went right to the couple that came in after us to get them a table.  The hostess should have asked who was next.  I was so mad at the bad service at the front door we left and went to Bob Evans where we always get good service.  I was excited for Red Robin to come to Pickerington but if that is the way they do business, I can't wait for them to leave.  They do not deserve any of my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington?start=20,,,,,
29,Zsander Z.,"Gahanna, OH",2,42,14.0,4.0,2017-05-26,Normally this place is super busy but it was not crowded around 8pm. We were seated promptly. The hostess was exceptional in that she knew we were on a date and seated us side by side in a booth (which is something we do anyway). The servers were friendly and prompt. The food was about the same as any other Red Robin. Overall the night was enjoyable and we would return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington,,,,,
20,Godfather ..,"Columbus, OH",3,36,67.0,5.0,2017-06-30,"We love Red Robin Yummm! My girlfriend got her usual Whiskey River BBQ Burger & I had the Pig Out Bacon Tavern Burger. If you love bacon (who doesn't?) then this is the burger to get!  They were both very good. Service was very good tonight and it was a busy Friday night. They brought out our burgers & fries, and about a minute or two later someone else brought out 2 more baskets of fries without us having to ask for more.  Now that's endless fries & great service! We will definitely go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington,,,,,
21,Anita C.,"Calgary, Canada",29,136,176.0,4.0,2017-07-12,"Got the keep it simple burger. It was cooked to perfection, juicy, burgery. The toppings were fresh. Some fries were a bit soggy, some were good. Nothing too much to say here. Service was spotty.  It's quite loud in there.

2,Ramy H.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,9,,5.0,2017-07-26,"As a lifelong Max & Erma's fan, whenever I wanted to go out for a good burger, I didn't go to Red Robin. Eventually, I tried Red Robin and realized that it was every bit as good as Max & Erma's and in some ways even better. They offer bottomless sides with your meal and bottomless speciality drinks such as root beer floats. Plus, they have sweet potato fries which are delicious and not available at many places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington?start=20,,,,,

I was ready to leave.... the food and the service made up for it! You can customize any portion of your order and you have unlimited refills of French fries!!!

4,Miss J.,"Canal Winchester, OH",49,54,,4.0,2017-08-18,The food here is good. The burger my husband ordered wasn't as spicy as he hoped and they forgot the pickles I asked for though. Fast service but the 30 minute wait on a Thurs is kinda nuts. But overall we had a good meal. Main problem is the tiny initial fries portion. They used to give you a normal portion and then bottomless if you wanted... I had to ask for more fries which was a first because they only give you a few initially.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pickerington?start=20,,,,,

24,Megan V.,"Columbus, OH",182,22,5.0,3.0,2017-09-29,"This was not my favorite of Red Robin locations. Usually we get take-out and the bartender is awesome so we figured we would try to eat at the restaurant. The decor is funky and cool- Rubixcube pictures on the walls, cool light fixtures and chalkboards you can bring to your table. The service was not so great. We waited a good 15 minutes after we were done to get our bill- our waiter was nowhere in sight. The food was just average. I know it's not the fanciest of places but still.

I noticed both times I came to dine-in that there are a lot of flies flying around, disgusting. The food itself did not disappoint, I always get a burger and It is always good.
