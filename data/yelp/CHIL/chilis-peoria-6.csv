Courtney C.,"Chicagoland, IL",198,839,1924,4.0,3/17/2013,"When in Peoria this weekend, it was hard to find a restaurant that 3 friends with absolutely different tastes could all agree on. Chili's was one that we all thought sounded good, so we decided to go there for a late lunch. It's a chain restaurant, so I won't bore you with what you already know.  The service was excellent. If you're keeping up with my past reviews, you know that service is one of the most important things to me. I can eat at any restaurant, so I'd prefer to get a genuine smile along with my food. Another mom and pop restaurant we went to on Friday could take some tips on the service front. I ordered the lunch portion of chicken fajitas. Normally one of my favorite entrees at Chilis, these were only okay--something was off with them. However, I did like their lunch menu. You can get a soup or salad with any of the lunch portions for $6, $7 or $8. My friend got the Southwest mac and cheese (which I almost ordered) and she loved it. I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sausage soup and it was phenomenal. It was mostly a veggie soup, but it had little pieces of meat and a nice kick to it. I would go back to Chilis just to get some more of the soup. I also heard another waitress say that a lot of the menu has changed. I'm not sure if it's for the better since I ordered the same ol' thing, but I did see a bunch of menu items that looked good. Side note, the Ziosks (self-pay device) that are at your table need to be implemented at every single restaurant in Illinois. They make it so easy to split the check, add a tip and pay with your card at the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Jim C.,"Lincoln, IL",25,17,23,5.0,3/22/2017,I went to Peoria for a meeting. Afterwards several people from the club I was attending went across the street to Chili's to eat. The service was good and the burger I had was great. It's a chain so the menu is pretty much the same as other Chili's restaurants. The server was really good. I'll probably go back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
J Curtis L.,"Coronado, CA",0,15,,3.0,10/18/2016,"Bud longnecks @ $4.17 a bit pricey, food is standard chain style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Tia D.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",8,154,52,3.0,3/26/2015,"We wanted to try out the Dr. Pepper baby back ribs so in we went for the two for $20 with no high expectations, surprisingly, it was a pretty good experience, we were promptly seated at a table, the waitress was friendly & professional helping us through our two for twenty offerings.  We chose the fried cheese (mozz) app to share which came out fresh, hot & gooey with marinara sauce, dr. pepper baby back ribs, a nice helping (five bones) these were very good for a chain restaurant, smokey flavoring with savory & sweet melding perfectly, tender and juicy too, the side of broccoli with melted butter on the side was fresh as well. They have an electronic device on the table to play games, order drinks or more food even pay for your order without the waitress being present, pretty cool, would definitely return for those ribs alone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Bill S.,"East Leroy, MI",1,37,42,2.0,6/11/2014,"I don't expect much from a generic chain restaurant, they are all pretty much variations on a theme. This Chili's failed to meet even those low expectations. The bar area is crowded, not with people, but with tables, crammed in so tight you can't really even walk through the area.  The entire bar area had a stale funk smell to it. This comes from poor cleaning practices and the inability to remove the mung from the various nooks and crannies where it collects over time. All I can think is that if you can't even clean the customer facing areas, how clean can the behind the scenes activities be? The food was ok, though the ranch dipping sauce was thin and so watered down it just dripped right back off of anything placed on to it. I've been to some nice Chili's restaurants, and this wasn't one of them...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Tiffany L.,"Peoria, IL",0,6,,5.0,5/11/2016,"Me and my friends came to this location hoping for a really good dinner to start off our night (my best friends 21st birthday). We were not at all disappointed. The server, Anthony, gave us spectacular service. It was the best service I've ever had at that location. Everything came out on time, the food was great, the drinks from the bar were phenomenal and Anthony was so kind! I definitely recommend this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Kathleen J.,"Peoria, IL",118,53,14,5.0,10/21/2014,"As far as Chilis goes, this is one of the best. Servers are incredible, especially Anthony and Katie. They go above and beyond for the picky eaters like myself. I always am asking for extras like ranch or cheese and I am hardly ever charged. The food always comes out great and the atmosphere is very inviting. I've been here with groups, on a date, and even by myself. My only knock is the to-go portion. Wasn't all that hot and I was always charged for extras.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Kleshia B.,"Peoria, IL",2,6,6,5.0,10/14/2013,Love the California Flatbread!!!! Yum! Even available on lunch special. Perfect:-),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Jay M.,"Peoria, IL",13,76,10,2.0,5/17/2014,"Dirty dirty. Service was eh, service area was gross and servers were argueing in the back almost the entire time.  Chilis Is chilis but I've had better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Becky A.,"Peoria, IL",1,34,,4.0,10/28/2014,The new burgers are great here and the pickles are fantastic. The cook new how to make the burger medium. And they gave me mor than 3 slices of avocado for my 99 cents.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Stephanie T.,"Peoria, IL",44,19,2,2.0,2/10/2014,"Usually have good experiences at Chili's, however last Sunday was a stinker. Server was ok, brought us refills as Chili's normally does. But...the food! Took much longer to arrive than on any weeknight, and my favorite Buffalo Chicken Ranch sandwich was soggy, as were the fries. No crispy flavor here! My companion's meal was also sub-par...hoping it was just a fluke. Must be the B-team on Sunday afternoons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Dave B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",37,121,1,3.0,4/15/2013,"We visit Chili's often for dinner and it's a decent place to eat.  The service is always friendly and we are seated quickly.  I usually have the Big Mouth Bites and Kevin tries different things, and while the main entrée is usually great, the fries and other accompaniments can be very standard.  That said, we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Rebecca K.,"Peoria, IL",11,56,,3.0,5/30/2011,"I usually prefer to stick to local/independent restaurants and am often unimpressed with chains, but the truth is, Chili's is indeed A-OK. I've only eaten at this location once, but when we did, the food was hot, fresh, plentiful, and quick - and that's even when we took advantage of the 2 eat for $20 deal (one app, two entrées). Our server was friendly and engaging, answered questions we had, and checked up on us frequently without making us feel harassed. They have a number of tempting specials, and it can turn out to be a very affordable meal if you make the right choices (on the right days). Our meal of two mug-sized margaritas, guac & salsa app, fried shrimp, and a bacon burger (plus sides for the entrées) came to $35 after tax and a (slightly generous, 'cause our server was pretty cool) tip, and we were more than full enough to skip dessert. Not too shabby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
Ruperto R.,"West Des Moines, IA",27,175,16,3.0,2/22/2011,"I usually go for dinner and ive been satisfied when I do. The staff is good and they take care of you and seem attentive. They change the menu from time to time to mix things up and keep it fresh. You can sit at the bar of not, they have seats around the bar as well. They can get busy during dinner time but wait time isnt that bad. They have good desserts as well. I'll keep coming back as I havent been unsatisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
I.S. D.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,5.0,1/27/2011,"I highly recommend their new lunch menu.  I ordered a salad with half of a grilled turkey sandwich.  It was a nice, filling lunch, and the cost was only about $6.00.  Good food at a great price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peoria-6
