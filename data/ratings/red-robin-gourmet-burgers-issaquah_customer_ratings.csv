111,Richard T.,"Bellevue, WA",151,416,15.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"This is your typical Red Robin restaurant, but my first at this location. The service was ok seeing how very busy this restaurant was on a Sunday evening. I was just surprised that the place was packed. They seemed to have alot of servers and waiters around to make sure everything runs smoothly. I had the bacon cheeseburger which was ok, but nothing very outstanding. It just tasted like any old burger which I could of had at B.K. or Jack in the Box. I'm not sure, but the quality and the size of the burgers have gone down from when I first began going to Red Robin many years ago.  Oh well I guess that is why I could only give them three stars. Very average burger joint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-issaquah?start=100,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

134,Julia Z.,"Bellevue, WA",561,589,586.0,4.0,2012-07-24,"I've recently been forced to go gluten-free and thought that was going to be the end of my years-long loyalty to Red Robin... after all, a burger is not a burger without a BUN! Three options exist for the gluten-free: 1. Udi's Gluten-Free Bun: $1 upcharge, but surprisingly nice. Very easy to forget that it's gluten-free, and the $1 is reasonable (they are more than that if you buy a bag of 4 at the store). 2. Lettuce wrap. No bun, but they wrap your burger in big leaves of lettuce so you can pick it up and eat it without making (much) more mess than you would with a bun. They have actually offered this for many years for the low-carb crowd. 3. On a plate. No bun, but they put the whole thing, carefully arranged, on a real ceramic plate. It's meatloaf for one! (Don't be depressed about the lack of bread). The server we encountered here was friendly and knowledgeable about all these options. It was busy but she did not betray a single bit of frustration while walking me through my choices. The ticket had ALLERGY ALERT on the top, and they were careful to confirm that my meal was gluten-free when they brought it to me. Depressingly, my beloved sweet-potato fries are NOT gluten-free, but there are enough other choices that I will get over it. Many restaurants would do well to learn a thing or two about serving celiacs from Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-issaquah?start=120,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

104,Kevin W.,"Bellevue, WA",229,745,3810.0,3.0,2012-10-02,"I typically don't like to get my burgers at diners since it's usually more convenient getting them at fast food restaurants instead. But my friend suggested coming to Red Robin, and I just couldn't say no. This store is decent, and they seem to be kept in fairly good condition. But it's honestly just as average in Issaquah as it is anywhere else. My first encounter with this place consisted of me rushing in to ask the waitress where the nearby Regal Cinemas was. She was helpful, and in fact all the workers I talked to here were pretty nice. I ordered a grilled mushrooms burger with some pink in the middle for $9.99. This was a suggestion from a friend; I'd have no idea what to order otherwise! This was a really big burger, and it was stuffed full of mushrooms! It even looked like there were more mushrooms than meat in it. Accompanying this all was melted Swiss cheese and a nice garlicky taste. And of course, there were also fries on the tray. They were a golden yellow, nice and plump, and showed no signs of being overcooked. I would like to give a higher rating, but it's not like the food was anything spectacular. Fast food has often provided me with better deals in the past. And ten dollars for any burger should mean that the burger is going to be nothing but excellent, but here it was just ""A-OK."" Still, I may find myself coming here again since my friend mentioned this being a favorite hangout place for her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-issaquah?start=100,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.508,2.92

Too noisy, caters to kids and kids are noisy and shouldn't be allowed out of the house. The food was OK, but the burger I had, the Prime Chophouse, was not worthy of the name or price. M's burger had traditional fixin's and was quite good. The fries were good, and hot. BUT, We had to wait an inordinate amount of time after we ordered a refill on fries. And the refill was quite small. So, yes you get fries, but not gladly, not graciously. So, if you like noise, if you like an average burger for a higher than average rice, this is a fine choice. If you have kids, it's OK, but remember, you're punishing everyone else in the place. Go there again, probably not.

The whole time, from when we sat down to when we had to rush out to try to make our movie. We are a family of 6, and dont really take our family out that much. It was a celebration, cuz My husband wasnt working and we wanted dinner before our movie. This red robin is close to the theatre, so we came here. WE HAD A HALF HOUR TO EAT AND GET TO THE MOVIE, WHICH NORMALLY SHOULD BE PERFECT. The server was nice, but she walked around like she didnt care about anything, and especially us .We sat down and it took her a while to even approach us. Her section had one other family in it. She took our drink order, and then we waited so long for her to come back, and take our order. After she took our order and had waited about 10 minutes, no lie, to finally get my husband and I's beer, and my 4 kids drinks.  We asked for fries ahead of time, cuz the kid were very hungry. They took another 10 minutes to get to us. No kidding! So, after the family scarfed the small basket of fries, we sat and stressed that we wouldnt make the movie, and kids were restless cuz they were patiently waiting for now 26 minutes. Our food came. The kids spaghetti didnt have any sauce on it. We asked for more right away. My husbands burger looked good, but I didn't have any food. They asked me what I ordered, and said they were sorry. Meanwhile, We had no silverware. Which was a big problem cuz my kids finally had food, but couldn't eat. I don't really understand why it took so long to bring them silverware either, because the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Anyway, I had to wait for my burger, and they apologized she had forgot it. It came NOT HOW I ORDERED IT, and was COLD!! At this time, I DID NOT CARE ANYMORE. I just ate. I hate complaining. I never do. So I was pretty much the most irritated I have ever been!! So, we had 5 minutes to eat. It was terrible! My kids were s sad we were going to miss the show.  The main purpose we went out last night.  We shoveled it in as fast as we could, I was feeding my 4 yr old, who hasn't been fed like that since she was TWO, just to try to hurry!  The male manager was very nice. He helped with our bill, which we had already asked for.  But, there was no way we were going to pay for this.

They brought it back a couple minutes later, but all they did was take the bun off and wrap it with lettuce. If I was intolerant to gluten that would have been a great deal to me. Though they made the mistake by putting the bun on they should have made it again without the bun. To top if off when I got the burger it was cold.

119,Jonathan C.,"Seattle, WA",26,31,53.0,1.0,2013-05-24,"I was craving some Buffalo wings, so I called in an order of Buzzard Wings® and took them back to my desk at the office. What was inside the box was NOT Buzzard Wings® but about a half dozen wing sections piled on some soggy potato chips. Missing was any sort of carrot or celery sticks.  The wings themselves were not tossed in any sort buffalo sauce, but it appeared that the sauce was drizzled inside the take-out box creating an unappetizing mess.  Most of the wings themselves managed to keep clear from the drizzle and many of them where bone dry. That was a neat trick.  I said to myself out loud, ""I'm not eating this."" I actually took the order back to complain. The manager explained that they changed the Buzzard Wings® recipe about a month ago and they would be happy to make them the ""old way"". Fine, I'll take those.  I suggested that since they made so many changes the dish that they should consider changing the name on the menu.  ""Well,"" he confessed. ""They are actually now called 'Bar Wings and Chips®'."" He added the online to-go menu had not been updated.  This begs the question, when I called in and ordered ""Buzzard Wings®"", why didn't they take a moment to explain that these had been replaced by ""Bar Wings and Chips®""...maybe even explain the difference.... and then add that they could still make either ""Buzzard Wings®"" or the new ""Bar Wings and Chips®""?  Whatever.  Finally got the ""Buzzard Wings®"" back to my desk. No carrots, but at least there was celery. Thank goodness I ordered an additional side of the red sauce, because like the previous order, many of the wings managed not to have much sauce on them at all.  I finally was able to dig in. A little frustrated, but not enough to warrant a yelp review. I put on my latex gloves (I am hardcore about my wings) and began to dig in.  One thing was immediately clear, and that was that the wings themselves seemed overly processed (in a Velveeta ""cheese"" sort of way). I don't know how they get them in, frozen, in a can, or freeze-dried, but aside from the bones, the chicken lacked any sort of firmness in the texture. The meat itself was so mushy that it was more like eating an oyster on the half shell. I didn't think it was possible for chicken to disintegrate in your hands so easily once a little pressure was applied.  They texture of the chicken was so baffling, that it could be used as an oddball basket ingredient on an episode of Chopped. I can see the cook on the TV looking at processed wings and thinking, ""what am I going to do with THAT?!!!"" This is too bad. When I lived in Staten Island there was a Red Robin not too far from my house and I used to go there all the time,  just for the wings! I think back then they were still called ""Buffalo wings"" and I am quite sure they were prepared with fresh chicken. I guess those days are over at Red Robin.  And while I am at it, I hate, Hate, HATE their ridiculously sized menus. They are as wide and as tall as two football fields. Seriously, they make feel like I am five years old.  The previous time I went to Red Robin I promised myself that I would never go back.

Probably 8-10 minutes after food delivery.   Same story with salad dressing.   While waiting for the silverware my wife plucked a broccoli from her plate and found a long black hair wrapped around it and another piece. The rest of the food was good one we got to actually eat it.   Our waitress was actually fairly attentive but seemed to have thought the other person who delivered our food was taking care of us.  She had to clean up the mess and did well.  Manager did take care of us when he found out about our issues so I can't complain.  Only reason I bothered to add this was to add to the interesting string of people having issues with silverware.  Bizarre.  Also,  we've had issues with service here in the past (again manager has always taken care of us,  which alleviates the sting and kept us coming back).  I think if they could fix a few processes they would be all good.

I still go because of the convenience factor, and there is nothing wrong with the food itself, it's as consistent as other locations. But the service here is AWFUL. It is so slow, and the servers are just so apathetic. They will walk by you like 10 times before coming by and acknowledging you, and you can tell they hate their job. When the bar area is full and we are waiting for a table, it will take a good 5+ minutes for someone to even come by and clean one for us to sit down. Never come here if you're in a hurry. We usually come by on Friday nights and ALWAYS sit in the bar area, cuz the rest of the place is packed with children, but it's just pathetic really. I've found the best thing to do is just to sit at the bar, the bartender is bound to give you better service since you are sitting right in front of them then the other servers, or even the managers who roam around acting like they care if customers are happy or not.  They also don't have food specials during Happy Hour either. I don't know if that's a new thing across all Red Robins, or just this location. But I am definitely not a fan of this.  If this place wasn't so close to where I live, I wouldn't step foot in here again.

Do not expect 5 star service and 5 star food when dining at a big box chain restaurant that caters to families.  As a parent, this place is awesome. It's loud already so my kids usually aren't bothering anyone with their topic of choice or their meltdown over dropping their apple juice on the floor.  The food comes out quick. Stick to ordering a hamburger or something basic. I've tried many things off the menu and sticking to their specialty is the safest bet.  They have a full bar. On that note, our food  usually comes before out drinks. Even the apple juice comes from the bar so the kids usually have a bit of a wait for their drinks unless your waiter brings you some water.  I wish the drinks from the bar would come out faster.  I think it must be standard protocol here not to seat you with silverware because many people who order a hamburger and French fries can do with out silverware. On that note, I think the servers are usually busy and on auto pilot that you usually have to remind them to bring you silverware if your order something that requires a fork, spoon or knife.

I know it's a chain and my expectations are tailored as such, but I've been to countless Red Robins across multiple states (probably shouldn't be proud of that) and this was one of the worse I've been to. Consistency is completely lacking at this particular Issaquah Red Robin, and I was really disappointed.  It's not hard to make a Whiskey River barbecue chicken salad, and all other Red Robins seem to have no problem with this maddeningly simple recipe. But this Red Robin somehow forgot to put the salad's very namesake barbecue sauce on the salad, which left me with a completely dry bed of wilted, brown lettuce, some fatty chicken breast, and other forgettable ingredients. They also forgot the avocado which, if I were queen, would he punishable by death.  Everything else we had was either wrong or completely forgettable. I usually love Red Robin and know their menu well. I also know how their meals are supposed to taste (aka their French Onion Soup should actually NOT taste like dirty sock water). But this particular location just doesn't hit the consistency mark on their decades' old recipes, and it's really sad.

113,Matthew M.,"Snoqualmie, WA",0,17,1.0,1.0,2014-09-03,"We have gone to the Issiquah red robin several times.  We go because we have two sons  (5 and 6) who plead and beg us to go. Red Robin causes this appeal by directly advertising to kids with cartoons, a colorful decor, a fun atmosphere and child oriented foods. I visited this past week with just one son and my wife.  The lowered supervisory demands allowed me more time to take in the dining room. I have always thought  that this location was a little worn: scratches on floors and tables, and a general appearance of be ng a frequently used restaurant. What I had failed to notice where the scaly and gross feeling of caked on grease, food and a unknown but likely fearsome collection of bacteria and the variety of other detritus that customers may have on their hands upon returning from the bathroom.  Not only did I find gross muck on the chairs, but also found it on the tables, walls and floors.  There were corners on the floor where there such a significant buildup of filth it looked like a grey and brown, nightmare inducing snow drift. The fresh cutlery, hopefully we're clean, but there looked to be some substance on them. I forced myself to believe they were water stains.  The devices they used to present appetizers were chipped and rusted, likely serving as a breeding ground  for the gross population of microbes in the dining area. I am not the first to suggest this, as I googled filthy ""red robin"" and there were no shortage of complaints from a variety of sources. Try it yourself. I can live with filth and eating around it, but I bring my kids to this place as do other parents. Seniors are just as vulnerable to bood born disease as  young children, and Red Robin directly appeals to this most at risk demographic  (grand parents and children). Red Robin is quite aware of taco diction of their dining rooms (how can they not be, considering the volume of complaints available on the internet). Failing to create an at least visual attempt at sanitary practice, clearly shows that they are content to  take money from those they harm. At the very least Red Robin shows a lazy contempt for their customers. However knowing that this company has the years of operational experience but not the will to keep their dining room clean, Red Robin comfortably joins the ranks with Comcast as an evil  company. TL/DR - the restauant is a gross nightmare. Avoid bringing the young and old there  to avoid the likelihood of food borne illness. ps - took some pictures on the sly.  Will post if I can figure out a way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-issaquah?start=100,2.68,2.68,2.68,1.924,2.68

Desserts are ok. Tip: when someone orders appetizers make sure to bring them out and give ample time to eat before bringing entrees out 2 minutes later.  *make sure to sign up for their royalty program.

Red Robin's method is a little different, take the fries that have been sitting there for ten minutes, covered in salt and throw them BACK into the fryer so the salt burns into them, and the outsides are burnt to hell, and the insides are a disgusting, congealed mess. Then, of course, never check back with the guest to make sure they haven't screwed up too badly. Spend all your time talking to your friends and the bartender. Much better solution. When you explain that the fries were inedible? ""Oh, we can make you some more!"", Mmm-hmmm, after I've eaten my entire sandwich and three of my own fingers due to starvation?

We all order right away, then our food came out in waves of one dish here, one dish there, over the course of an hour and 20 minutes!!!

124,Donna H.,"Issaquah, WA",5,97,,1.0,2015-09-15,"Unfortunately my kids love this restaurant.  No idea why this place always entices children but my son decided to choose it for his 4th birthday.  With a table for 15 we were seated in a decent time with a 15 minute wait on Sunday, September 13 at 5:15pm.  First, the hostess dropped off the stack of 15 menus on the table.  She didn't even think of distributing it to each seat so I had to do the job for her.  Is it because she expected she'd get her 18% gratuity portion for a big group so she didn't have to do her job?  This was only the beginning of a bad night. After everyone sat down we all ordered our drinks and food right away.  I have 3 kids all 6 and under and they waited quite patiently considering the long wait.  The drinks didn't all come in at the same time.  Whoever ordered a milkshake, like my kids, had to wait 20 extra minutes while those who ordered the freckled lemonade got theirs in 10 minutes.  The food started coming about 40 minutes after ordering.  There were 5 people who were served first.  Waited another 5 minutes and another 5 people in my group were served.  Here's the catch, the last 5 people who weren't served were my husband, my kids and me!  In the past they have always made sure to serve kids first.  What child is going to sit still for an hour?  None of my kids were screaming or crying but they were getting restless.  We waited another 15 minutes and my kids dishes finally arrived.  But, where was my burger and my husband's burger?  At this time my brother in law was done with his meal and the grandparents at the other end of the table were nearly done.  My sister had gotten her Banzai burger only to find out her patty was completely charred and so was the inside of the bun.  She had to ask for another.  Same thing happened again for the 2nd burger and Alana, our waitress, said they didn't cut her burger in half for her, which she asked when she ordered, because it would be quicker to get it to her as she set her burger in front of her.  Uhh... who does and says that?  Lazy?  Once again, her burger did not have any pink in the inside.  What baffled all of us was how my sister was able to get a replacement burger the first time before my husband and I even got our order.  I finally got my Teriyaki Chicken Burger only to find my chicken and bun was also burnt.  Fed up and fuming after waiting 1.5 hours without our food, I asked for a manager. Amy, a floor manager, came because the manager in the kitchen couldn't come out since he was cooking that night.  My husband and I were livid.  We couldn't believe all that happened.  My sister's 3rd burger came shortly before my 2nd replacement came and my husband still didn't get his first order of his Royal Red Robin Burger.  We shared our dissatisfaction with the food and service to Amy again.  This time almost yelling because we were appalled.  Why hadn't Alana told the kitchen my husband's burger wasn't made and to skip the rest of the orders on the queue to make his!  Amy informed us Alana had been working at RR for awhile because the way she acted seemed like she was a newbie.  Alana decided to forget about us or thought a big group means automatic 18% gratuity so she never asked how our food was or refilled any of our drinks.  She never thought of bringing more napkins for us with kids at the table.  Our drinks were all refilled only after my husband and I had a talk to the manager.  Burnt food, no refills, long wait times and not serving my kids first were all that dampened the birthdays we were celebrating.  My husband only got his Royal Red Robin burger 2 hours after we ordered.  Never again Issaquah Red Robin... On the plus side our food was comped and we got a gift certificate but the service really needs to be looked into and we still can't believe it. Training to all staff needs to be done by either their general manager or corporate.  First, orders for any table should be together.  There should NEVER be a time when people get their food while others at the table are completely done with theirs.  It's just rude!  Second, a table shouldn't be left to no service just because they think they will get their 18% gratuity.  No drink refills, no asking how the food was, or if we needed utensils, napkins, extra fries or sauce.  Why would a hostess not distribute all of the menus to each seat or to each person?  I will never understand unless it's McDonald's and I'm ordering from the counter.   On a side note for parents... do not ever ever order milk from this location.  It is not properly cooled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-issaquah?start=120,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.5400000000000003,2.32

Our server took the pizza back right away to have it remade, but it took another 25 minutes to get it!  By the time the manager delivered it with no apologies, everyone else was done, so we just asked for boxes that never came.  We were there to celebrate my son's birthday, so our server did bring the birthday sundae, which was a disappointment compared to what they used to be - just a small square dish with a scoop of vanilla, a drizzle of chocolate sauce and whipped cream.  No sprinkles. No cherry. No candle.  I guess this is another change to the ""new,"" less family-friendly Red Robin.   We asked to speak to the manager since he never came back, and when he came over, he was not at all apologetic and fairly defensive.  We were expecting a discount on our bill or coupons for next time, but instead, he acted like we should be thanking him for taking my son's pizza off the bill (but it was his birthday, so it was already free!!!).  He said he's only been working there for 2 weeks and they're understaffed.  (Then why are they seating so many people and not letting anyone know in advance it's going to be a longer wait than usual???)  He then proceeded to complain that he'd already been there for 12 hours and his wife is calling to yell at him because she's home with their 2 year old.   While I have sympathy for his situation, it is not my problem - I am there as a customer, and he is getting paid to do a job.  He still did nothing to ""make it right"", so we left completely frustrated and still a bit hungry.  My previously Red Robin loving kids said they never want to go back.  We will be going to The Ram from now on instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-issaquah?start=80,2.0,2.55,2.55,1.6680000000000001,2.33

With that in mind, my group of 6 didn't wait any longer than 5ish minutes to get seated. Overall, dining experience itself was alright. Service was a bit slow but our waitress tried her best to be lively and personable. For the bottomless fries......it was a little tough in getting refills with this since all of our refills were miniscule amounts and with our waitress constantly being away, we didn't enjoy as much fries as we had wanted. However, our waitress did make a great attempt at letting my group sample the various sauces to which we all appreciated. Major upside to this place was: the little check machine works! And it works beautifully when you're trying to split checks in a group. Fairly intuitive, this machine is easy to use when splitting the bill, playing games (it cost $$$), or ordering more food.

We have a 30-45 minute wait every time.  Finished this review; still no food in sight... Update: We gave up and left. I'm so hungry I have a headache and I'm very sad. We recently moved to Issaquah from Seattle. We went to the Red Robin near us in Seattle so often they knew us by name. RR is one of the few places I can get a gluten-free burger. I love the food. I miss the food. I miss the fun of going to RR. I miss all the fun times we used to have at RR. This is the 5th time in a row when we've had to wait more than 40 min for food on a non-weekend, post-dinner-rush evening.

Interestingly enough, it seems to be isolated to this location. When we are away or just simply trying a new one the service is on point. We noticed this location has gone through several management changes over the last 12 months or so. Nothing has changed. This trip was a fairly common occurrence when we eat here. Adult meals showed up 10-15 mins before the kids meals. Ordered two apps that never showed and we ended up getting them to go. Don't know what even happened there. Our server was extremely slow and highly incompetent. Just saying. Took 3 trips back to the computer to get the bill right. Actually charged us for 4 apps not 2, yes the same apps that never showed.

89,R H.,"Bellevue, WA",0,2,,4.0,2016-08-06,"Usually this Red Robin has great service times, but something went wrong.... Last night (Aug 5th 2016) we chose to visit Red Robin for my birthday. We sat outside. We knew it would be busy, as Friday nights typically are, however there were some serious staffing issues in the kitchen. Our party had to wait over an hour for appetizers, and over an hour for food. I think we might have waited an hour and a half -- maybe more.. Eventually we cancelled the appetizers, and asked for a manager. The manager was very attentative. He came right out to our table right away. Just as he had arrived, the appetizers we had waited so long for, and canceled, magically arrived too. The manager heard my party stating that we had canceled the appetizers, and he comped them out for us as a courtesy. He then proceeded to de-escalate a gentleman in our party who was extremely disturbed by the service times, as he has health issues that put him in a position to where he needs to eat within a certain amount of time or he gets sick . The manager was very accommodating, and patient! We also pointed out the fact that the table next to us had been waiting longer than we had and they had a young child with them. After hearing that, he made sure to visit their table immediately after visiting ours. I was impressed by the manager's willingness to take accountability for matters that were apparently out of his control (the kitchen was short staffed, due to staff calling in sick, and also the kitchen is using a new computer system or something like that...). I was impressed with our waitress too, as she had a heart of gold ... She was very professional. She was genuinely bothered by the timing issues of us getting our food, however she never bad mouthed her boss or coworkers. She apologized to us, and brought us complimentary french fries to hold us over while waiting. She was very patient as well when dealing with getting strong negative feedback from one of the disgruntled members of our party. She remained professional and empathetic to his situation, as we had been waiting a long time for our food. It made me feel good that she cared about us as customers. ALSO she accommodated my medical condition (recent weightloss surgery) by switching the complimentary ""birthday icecream sunday"" for a small bowl of fruit instead. THAT meant ALOTTT to me as I cannot eat processed sugar or I will be sick for hours. In the end, the manager ended up comping alottt of our bill. I felt that he comped a fair amount and we paid a fair amount. The manager did the right thing. And thats why I wanted to do the right thing and be sure that both the manager and our waitress get recognized for their efforts to keep us as customers. I wish I took note of their names, but I did not. Im sure the waitress will remember me. All in all, I feel that the manager and the waitress helped me turn my 1 star review into a 4 star review. 4 stars for the customer service!

44,Ranjit S.,"Issaquah, WA",0,9,,1.0,2016-08-22,"So disappointed. Again. We used to come here a lot last year, because my parents absolutely ADORE the Artic Cod Fish and Chips Basket. They order it everytime! I get something new everytime, because their menu is so much fun. However, this year, we've been having a bad experience. In March, my mother and I came, and when you walk in and go straight (keeping the bar to the left), there's a set of seating to the right that's shares a wall with the kitchen. We got the table that has a small space in the wall so you can see the kitchen. My mom was watching, and there was a basket of fish and chips sitting there when we sat down. She kept watching, we ordered, we waited, and they gave her the exact same basket. It was cold and oily and overfried, so she asked for it to be redone. The waitress was kind about it, and they made a fresh one that she enjoyed. Whatever, we got over it. A few months ago, I stopped in with my parents, and my dad asked for a shot of vodka with a squeeze of lemon. Waiter brought him a glass of water with a slice of lemon in it. Okay. He corrected it... twenty minutes later. Food came late, but it was hot and we were tired, so we didn't say anything. We had a 15% off coupon, and that day, of all days, ""all of their systems were down,"" according to alcohol-is-water waiter, so apparently we couldn't use it. Whatever, we got over it. Today, my mom and I had a long day, didn't feel up to cooking, so we went to Costco (literally thirty seconds away) to get gas, and then we went here to get dinner. We got our gas receipt from Costco at 4:35, and (for those of you who know how closeby it is) we were inside Red Robin by 4:40. We were seated by Andy, who was friendly; he gave us menus, and said our server would be there shortly. We were sitting and chatting, and there were three other occupied tables in our section. One of the servers was going back and forth to those three tables, and about twenty minutes later, after our failed attempts to flag down Andy, the server finally stopped by our table and asked, ""Have you been helped yet?"" We were confused and he explained that we weren't in his section and that no one told him that our table was assigned to him. We were a little peeved, but he [Jake?] was very apologetic so we brushed it off. We got water and ordered our meals. Around 5:20, we were getting a little impatient because we'd been sitting there for a while. I didn't know how long it had been, so I asked my mom to go get the gas receipt from the car to make sure I wasn't just being fussy about the wait. She left and came back with a receipt that showed that we'd been there for atleast 45 minutes. Jake was nowhere to be found, and the other three tables had ordered, gotten their food, and one had already left in the time we sat there. Another group even came, sat, ordered, and got their drinks by the time we looked at the receipt. We decided to leave, and my mom asked Jake to cancel the food. A waiter at the front asked us if everything was okay, and my mom explained that we'd been waiting for 50 minutes, 20 of which were without service. He found it absurd, given that there were less than twenty customers the entire time, and then the manager (who had been standing behind the waiter the entire time) simply offered us a gift card. ???? We didn't get service for twenty minutes and then we didn't get food for thirty minutes. Just because your employees can't communicate and your kitchen is slow doesn't mean you can get us to shut up with a gift card. We came for food that we intended to pay for. Money is not the issue. We don't need the gift card. We were already pissed off enough, but he didn't even bother explaining why they were slow, or even apologizing. Fix your service, train your staff.

42,Jessica L.,"Bellevue, WA",27,11,1.0,1.0,2016-09-18,"So I love Red Robin. I love the food and drinks and think they are very reasonably priced. This Red Robin is terrible. The service is horrible, you wait forever for your food. Don't bother ordering appetizers because you won't get them until your food comes out. This last visit, we came on at 11am on a Sunday because I was craving a Whiskey BBQ wrap. We were seated, given menus, and told our server would be with us shortly. After about 8 minutes our servers comes over and we order our drinks, appetizer, and food (there were just TWO of us.) This was obviously a mistake as it seemed to be information overload. We ordered boneless wings with ranch, one beer, one water, BBQ wrap and a burger. Guy left and I got my beer a few minutes later. Had to ask again for the water. After about 15 minutes we were wondering where the appetizer was. The server said he would check on it and it came out about a minute later and our food followed.  My fries were ice cold. I've never had fries that cold, ever. The burger was the wrong burger. My boyfriend is just pissed and hungry and at this point but I tell him to have them make him a new burger. Not a big deal, mistakes happen. When the server came back we let him know it was the wrong thing and he said he must not have heard right, and really had an attitude about it. A few minutes later he comes back and asks if it's necessary to make a whole new burger or if he can just add the Mac and cheese to it (it was suppose to be the new Buzz Tavern Mac and Cheese burger but they just gave him the regular Tavern) My boyfriend lost it at this point and said forget it because obviously it was an inconvenience for him to get the correct food as the server was still giving him an attitude and side eyeing him as he walked away. The server tried to back pedal but at this point it was too late, we asked for the check and left. I was charged for the burger that we never touched.  I wanted to speak to the manager however no one was at the hostess station so I had no one to ask. Also there was a line of people waiting for the hostess and no one was there so people were leaving since they had been waiting for a while.

Doesn't even look at us.. just they have to wait to the hostess. So rude! So we wait another 10 minutes.. then we watch our waiter wiping his nose numerous times.. gross. Wiping it on his pants.. pick his teeth and thank god he didn't deliver our food. Gross! So as we are paying on the hand held device there's a spot to put in comments. I start typing in that the staff neeed some hygiene training and the gross Mgr starts leaning over my shoulder reading what I'm typing. He then grabs it out of my hand n acts like he's trying to check in on us. All the while deleting my comments!! I ask for it back and he claims it would have come to him anyway. I doubt that!! These are health code violations!! Snot in food is not ok!!! And he tried to cover it up! Let's say we had some serious words about his dishonesty where he claimed he didn't delete anything! Liar!!! So Mgr with the broken front teeth.. know that I contacted headquarters for Red Robin and the young kid can learn.. but you are as nasty as they come.

The ""waiter"" (if that's what you want to call him) said he'd bring more fries. And fifteen minutes later, no fries. And nothing but excuses. You'd think a restaurant that offers bottomless fries would actually have fries? I mean, is that too much to ask.  At any rate, we've paid our bill and he comes back with yet another flimsy excuse. He says, ""i'll get you those fries to go"". Ten minutes go by, no waiter no fries. So, we pack up the kids and leave.

15,Marina D.,"Seattle, WA",85,104,41.0,1.0,2017-06-06,"I wrote a different review on RR for my experience with them as a delivery driver. This is purely review as a customer. I was craving a burger last night but considering my dietary restrictions (vegan/vegetarian) and being after 9pm, my only option was RR. I wanted to give them a try as hungry late night customer. Placed a to go order over the phone for a Garden Burger, no cheese, add grilled mushrooms + fries. When I got RR, which is located in a strange area for Issaquah, but ok, there was no host/hostess to greet me ... I had to walk around the corner to try to locate anybody, while customers were giving me looks because I looked lost.. I was ! A nice lady greeted me and left my bag on the table and told me to help myself with ketchup. (Laying next to brown, old limes... do they actually use these?? Yiek!) I was never given napkins or utensils. Then she showed me an iPad where I can pay, and it quickly prompted for a tip. I gave $2 since I wasn't that impressed to start with and my burger was $9. I selected 'email me' the receipt, so didn't scrutinize it until today. I just saw that I paid $17 for something that should cost 3$ at most. Here's why and I swear this is the truth and nothing but the truth! 1) Their fries, all 10 that I got, lol, yea that's puny considering 17$+ charge, were undercooked. I could taste raw 'potatoesness' ..ew, didn't finish. 2) Burger was filling, I'll give it that, but the bun turned soggy and was of weird green color, didn't taste moldy... so that's a relief. However, since I wasn't given napkins, the bun and food contents ended up everywhere. ( Had to eat in my car because I was waiting for someone ) 3) After 10 min of eating I started feeling sick as I tasted old grease in my mouth. Ew!!!! You know that overused grease that you shouldn't pour down your drain? That! I can now officially say that I hate RR with a passion, and would rather starve than give this establishment another penny! Just look at their reviews on Yelp! They suck and it's consistent throughout. I will compliment the girl working there, the receipt said Nicollette? She was the only one left on the floor to serve everyone, I guess RR can't hire..like 1 more person to help out greet customers, and check them out properly. Nicollette! Girl, you can do better than RR!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-issaquah,1.92,1.89,1.89,,1.9020000000000001

Maybe there's a different standard on the east side...maybe the training is a bit different...maybe in Issaquah they have lower standards, but I would find that remarkably difficult to believe. Our server became a ghost...well, not really, we could clearly see her congregating with the other Red Robin staff around their order station. Note to Red Robin in Issaquah, if you're going to allow your associates to stand around doing nothing, perhaps don't put the computer in the middle of the dining and seating area where your guests have crystal clear visibility of their wait staff talking....standing....doing literary nothing...not getting refills, not asking about our visit, not bringing the refills requested after finally nabbing her attention from the boys by the order station...Not correcting the fact that somewhere between you entering our order and the kitchen preparing our order there was a mistake made on our sons burger...not doing anything....hell, in Issaquah the servers don't even say goodbye!
