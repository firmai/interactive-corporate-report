But the server was not very attentive especially being at 2 in the afternoon, they were not busy, but she was visiting with friends who had a new baby there. Looks like they were co workers that were too busy socializing than taking care of the patrons. Would give it more stars but service was not too good. A bar tender is supposed to be working the bar area, not in the other side of the wall chatting with friends and discussing breastfeeding.

100,Mike D.,"Mokena, IL",1,16,,2.0,2012-05-16,"I tried Red Robin today. I've heard a few people say the place was pretty good. I wasn't too impressed. With including ""gourmet burger"" after their name, I wasn't wowed with the burger. Maybe I just needed to order one of the burgers with more ingredients on it. I had a double cheeseburger and I was expecting a large juicy burger but the burger consisted of two thin patties. The meat seemed like it was coarsely ground also. The texture wasn't very good. I did enjoy the bottomless steak fries and our server was fairly attentive. The bill for wife and two young kids without tip was $30. Next time I may just drive south on LaGrange and stop in Denny's for a doubly cheeseburger at least I would get my hands greasy.

My grandkids ate all their food.  Two daughters ordered Margaritas but were served something that was not a Margarita.  The server promptly replaced them.  I've had several different burgers in the past and enjoyed them all.  They have always been cooked to my specifications.  This day I had the Burning Love, a hot and spicy burger.  Quite good.  The unlimited steak fries are good and a nice change from the usual fries. Refills on drinks were kept coming without asking.  One of my grandkids turned one that day and they sang to her and presented her with an ice cream sundae, from which she immediately grabbed a handful of whipped cream.  Cute.  Other than the noise level, it was a pleasant dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=120,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.732,3.2400000000000007

51,Mary E.,"Chicago, IL",50,121,,4.0,2012-09-19,"I finally ate at Red Robin...yummy! The burgers are big, the service is great, and the atmosphere is fun.  It reminded me of a Portillo's with waitress service.  The prices are a little on the high side for standard burger fare, but if you eat in, your dinner includes ""bottomless fries."" Also, there are free refills on most non-alcoholic beverages.  I had the avocado  bacon burger, which was delicious. I also tried the raspberry limeade, which had been recommended by a friend.  Very refreshing, and yes, I took advantage of those free refills!   This is a family-friendly place, not so much the sort of restaurant that is conducive to lingering and catching up with someone over a long conversation.  I don't mean to imply they rush you out--they don't--but be prepared for a busy restaurant with a moderately high noise level.

47,Pauly S.,"Chicago, IL",105,72,37.0,3.0,2012-10-24,"I took my fiance here for her surprise birthday party last Saturday We hadn't been here for months, and we always like the bar & grill atmosphere that Red Robin presents... Plus, they have ""Never Ending Fries"" (def.: they are ""Never Ending"" only if you ask for more.  They won't refill your baskets like they do your soft drinks) So we came with a party of 14.  The wait was pretty short for that amount of people. But we sat down and ordered the cheese sticks (which are great).  One other person ordered the pretzel bites, which were really good too. For our entree, I ordered the Oktoberfest Burger (ham, Swiss cheese, sauteed onions, on a pretzel bun)...The Girl got a Spicy Chicken sandwich plain The food came out and I devoured it like a vacuum sucks dirt.  Probably because I had eaten NO MEAT for that entire week...and I was feeling less than a man. My friend had ordered an Oktoberfest burger as well, though he wanted it with no onion.  One thing that I have noticed in the past about this particular Red Robin is that if you order an item, and change it in any way...they usually fudge it up ...and they did.  First it was brought out with the onion...then without the ham, which negated the whole specialty burger idea.  He was upset...but I was fine! :-) Like my last review for Cracker Barrel, they also did they whole Birthday Song and desert deal as well...it was fantastic! At the end, our waiter seemed to forget a few of the bills.  Not mine!  We separated ours from the rest of the group (tip coming up) It was a good time.  The atmosphere is great, but I've had a better burger and fries at Five Guys.  Still a nice place to go, and OH BY THE WAY, their sweet potato fries are really good! ...and A LOT BETTER than that Purple Onion garbage dump!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park?start=80,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.732,3.2000000000000006

Kid (perternity test pending) and wifey had Tavern burger and I had some type of spicy-pineapply-hot pepper-double patty nonsense. Pattys were tender and well seasoned. Fries were unlimited, so I essentially could have ordered water and fries. Nevertheless, better than expected. Servicewasreally good. Waitress was a chubby/chatty gal...like, I get it. You want me.

I was so mad at myself for wasting my $$$ and my shopping time.  I keep trying to figure out why I would ever go back and all I can think of is there is no reason whatsoever.  There is nothing memorable about Red Robin, sorry, I really don't usually complain, but these establishments need to come up with something unique for their restaurant that makes a consumer want to come back.  Most of them don't!

The last two times we've been there the service was awful...and I mean awful. Slow, forgetful, totally uninterested. Further, the food is slipping downhill massively. The fries used to be really delicious and crispy and now they're soggy and not flavorful. You have to ask them to almost burn them to get them decent. I don't remember what happened exactly that was the straw that broke the camel's back the last time we were there, but my husband paid the bill, stood up and said ""we're never eating here again.

They serve bottomless plank style french fries.  Plus, a myriad of fried appetizers.  Then there's the sugary drinks that come in beautiful glasses.  The burgers are garnished with so much more calories.  You will pay an average of $10 a burger! They even have a Big Mac copykat with more calories than McDonald's. You can expect to pay nearly $100 for a family of 5.  The kids menu is for children 10 and under! If your 11yr. old child wants chicken tenders, you will have to pay over $10 from the adult menu, which only come with french fries!

It was snowing and cold, so I dropped my son off so that he could grab a table. He walked in and was seated right away. Parked, walked in and my drink was already on the table.

But we had to make our weekly trip to Trader Joe's or we'd be ordering Chinese food and pizza all week.  As we made our way there, we decided to get lunch at Red Robin. This was my first time at Red Robin and my boyfriend only recalled trying it once, a very long long time ago. He remembered ordered food at a counter and sitting down. Not a place with full waiter service. We were both surprised that it was a full out restaurant. But sat down anyways and ordered some burgers. Both of us wanted a cheaper place but neither regretted this choice. The burgers were great! I got the mushroom swiss burger (my favorite across the board) and my boyfriend got the chili chili burger. Because of the horrid weather, there were few other customers around so we got excellent service and a very friendly waitress.  The steak fries were wonderful. I enjoyed them and we even got a second order of them (since they were bottomless and free). Overall, we would definitely come back again when we have a taste for a burger.

Let's start off with this. Normally in my previous visits we got frys right off the bat and normally got  two or three new baskets before the food arrived. Not this time. We didn't get a single order of frys until our food arrived. Now just step back and think about that. That's like going to Olive Garden and them not giving you bread sticks until your food arrives. I ordered the rib tips & Mac and cheese. A few visits ago their Mac and cheese was great so I figured I would try it again. This proved to be a terrible choice. The cheese on top was melted but the middle was still cold once the cheese was removed. No biggie, things happen. They replaced the Mac and cheese. Now for the rib tips. They were honestly 95% bone and 5% meat. I couldn't get any meat off of them. Overall: I would come back, just never order the riblets & Mac and cheese again. Also, things happen.

As for my burger, it came to me mooing.  This isn't how a medium burger should look.  I was exhausted and didn't think to bring management's attention to the issue.  Then half way through eating my burger, I noticed that my plate was dirty on the side.   It all kind of dawned on me when I got home what a marginal experience I had had.  I e-mailed RR management that night.  When I didn't here back after a few days I e-mailed them back again.  I then received a call from a grumpy sounding manager, John.  He mentioned that he hadn't heard from corporate until that day.  John didn't seem genuinely interested in my poor experience.  Just the same he said he wanted to mail me a gift card.  Well, one week went by and no gift card.   I e-mailed RR management one more time to tell them that I was going to post something on Yelp.  The GM then contacted me.  At this point I wasn't interested.  Why should it take two weeks to address a poor experience.

The first time I came I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger, which I thought was great until the second time I came here, when I ordered the Burnin' Love burger, and that's gotta be one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. I was worried it was going to be too spicy, but it's mild (and not in a bad way, for those that are partial to really spicy foods). Lot of rich flavor in every bite. The salsa is great and so is the jalapeno roll that they use.  They also have a bunch of sauces you could ask for to use with your bottomless fries. I'd highly suggest trying thai chili and tavern. Chipotle is good too, but you can get that anywhere.

We came to Red Robin for some lunch with friends, upon entering we weren't greeted properly (No 'hello' or welcome to 'Red Robin'.) the hostess just pointed us to a table without a smile and we sat down. About five minutes later we finally saw our waitress, we ordered drinks and after the drinks were brought to the table we noticed two of them were only half full!  So, we order and appetizer and there are no sauces to be found on the appetizer, so I flag over the girl that brought us the appetizer and ask for sauce. She never comes back, fifteen minutes later I see our waitress again and ask her for the sauce that we asked for. . . she finally brings it and drops it on the table just to run off again when we all needed refills.

There was maybe between a teaspoon to a tablespoon of brisket on it. The brisket really didn't add anything. If it wasn't there and it was just bbq sauce I wouldn't have noticed a difference. To me it seems Red Robin has taken a step back since they opened at this location. They give you your fries in these little metal rings. All that does is limit how much fries are in my basket and looks tacky. Come on I'm an adult give me more tgan just a few fries. And, today the food took a really long time.

I think their strategy to making their burgers taste better is by starving you first. I should probably bring a snack next time to tide me over.  Our food finally made it's way to our table 25 minutes after that. So 45 minutes in, we're tasting the burgers we ordered. Disappointment. All our burgers and fries were really greasy. You can see a bucket of grease ooze out as you cut into the burger and a puddle of grease under my garlic fries. $13.49 for ""Gourmet Burger"". More like soggy burger. I was expecting a little more.  My sister-in-law ordered Mac and Cheese as a side to her burger. Said it tasted like it came out of a bag. Well.. Hehe. It did. My wife confirmed as she spotted them making it.. Microwaved in a bag, shook it up and dumped it in a bowl. First time at Red Robins and may be the last. I might give another location a try but... Meh.

Kyle our servicer,  was extrordinarily slow, and forgetful. We waited 15 before he took our drink order,  another 10 for water and maybe 10 more minutes for him to return to take our food order.  After waiting on our order 2 of the plates came to us which was not what was ordered.  The rest of the food and fries were cold. To get drinks refills was impossible,  certainly not worth the price especially since the cost of several were 4.95. I would have expected many refills - we were lucky to get 1 refill after the initial cup arrived. To get more fries seemed to be feat in itself.   Although it was busy and Kyle apologized for the slowness blaming it on the fact they were busy earlier,  he did nothing to improve our experience by speeding up his current service since the place had already begun to empty out after our drinks were delivered. We had to wait on napkins, forks and knives,  and by the time our second round of fries were delivered we were frustrated and swore to never return to this location again!  I'm sure Kyle works hard and waiting isn't an easy job but people tend to forget that a tip is NOT mandatory, as T.I.P.

The waitresses didn't have much to do and sat around talking with the bartender, but our waitress was nice enough. The busboys were really nice though. They asked us about our new year and how our meal was. Typically, you don't have bus boys who are so friendly.  The burgers were pretty good. They have some unique combinations, but the classic looks pretty good too. I had the Whisky River BBQ burger. It was big and I ended up only eating half, but I could've eaten the whole thing. My boyfriend got the Southern Charm Burger and, unfortunately, he won the plate off and he got the better entrée.

Went for a burger and a beer last night and had the exact same experience we've had every time...just so-so food and service. The burgers are ok, but nothing special (Five Guys are better); service is where I think they make their money because they never seem to have enough wait staff - maybe they will learn they cannot save their way into prosperity - service was slow and spotty especially with the fries (see below); on the good side they have a nice selection of beer with many on draft...so this is their bright spot. Now the fries. The schtik of Red Robin is (1) Gourmet burgers (which means they can put nearly anything you want on a fair burger for $10 and up) and (2) bottomless or endless French fries (not even close). For the second time when we were there the bottomless fries are only in name. You get fries with your burger and are supposed to get as many more as you want...but you won't see anyone come by and ask if you want more until you are on your last bite of hamburger. You'd think they live and die off French fry sales. Why couldn't they just have one of the wait staff come around to the tables with a big basket of fries topping off everyone who had fries? Why do they wait so long to come ask? And when you do ask you wait another ten minutes for them to come out...by the time they do you are sorry you asked. Really...just have a person cruising the dining room with fries to top everyone off...Quit waiting for people to beg for more. So their schtik is lost on me...loses me as a customer too.  In all fairness, the manager did make the rounds of the room also...and also did so as we were finished. We saw our waitress maybe three times...took the order (after we cooled our heels for awhile)...checked in right after (hadn't even taken a bite yet)...and told us how to check ourselves out. We were never offered any dessert...never offered another beer...and were only offered more fries as they were ready to clean the table off...nothing. To add to the lack of staffing, they now have machines on each table so you can check yourself out...swiping your card and printing out your own receipt. Their drive to cut staff makes this a people unfriendly place.

If you are in anyway handicapped, read on. If you have trouble walking, read on. If you just walk, read on. Most of the restaurant's floors are a tiled marble or slate or some kind of stone whether man made or natural. It is red and it is very slippery. I do not know if it is from the grease that is normally associated with restaurants or because of the air conditioning that there was condensation on the floor, or more likely, a combination of both. I have to use a cane to help me walk,  I am in the middle of getting both my knees replaced. The cane would not hold its gripe on the floor and kept sliding. I had to walk and hold onto the chairs, unoccupied tables, anything to stabilize me.  I nearly fell. Another patron, a woman, said that she also almost slipped if she hadn't gripped the booth divider. She complained but nothing was done. They had one warning sign out, the ones that you use for a wet floor, that was you only warning. A mop and some grease cutting detergent is not going to clean it. I worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years and have had to clean floors using a scrubbing machines to get the grease off. I would suggest that they have their floors cleaned regularly by an outside company or by a scrubber. One of these days someone is going to fall and they are going to have a lawsuit on their hands.  As for the food I would rate that 3 stars. The crab burger is good considering that it is not fresh like on the east or west coasts. We also had the fish and chips and chicken platter.

This was to be my first time at the restaurant and I was admittedly very excited. I have tried to visit multiple times but the lines were too long. On this day, I was told that the wait time would be approximately 25 minutes. And while this was not idea, I was willing to wait because I was with a friend who generally rants and raves about this restaurant. After 40 minutes after giving our names, I was told that we would be next. Finally after almost 50 minutes we were seated. This was a frustrating experience but I understand that the wait time generally depends on the leisure of the patrons. After being seated, we were greeted by a pleasant waiter who promptly took our order. We ordered several blue moons that took almost 15 minutes to come. I was then told that if I wanted an orange in it, it would take at least another 10 so we agreed to drink the drink with out its signature garnish. After waiting 20 more minutes, our waiter told us that the kitchen had been experiencing some problems all day and the ticket time was at least 45 minutes. We asked to speak to the manager 3 times before he came to our table to talk to us. When we finally got our food at least 50 minutes after being seated, it was ice cold. I was floored and very angry because at this time, we had waited almost 2 hours for food that was freezing cold. I should have known this would be an issue because multiple patrons around us were complaining and sending food back to the kitchen. The lady across from me sent he burger back and it did not return for at least 20 minutes. I was not prepared to experience the same torture on my empty stomach, plus my 4 year old was completely famished and starting to wine in anguish. We ended up leaving the restaurant with out eating anything and wasting 2 hours on a perfectly good day in a restaurant that was obviously mismanaged, understaffed and dishonest. In the future, it would be more appropriate to 1). Give a correct wait time so that patrons can make an educated decision about how long they want to wait, 2) Let people know upfront that there are issues in the kitchen and that the ticket time is exceeding 45 minutes 3) Better attend to your guests by at least providing the necessary garnishes for their drinks.

7,Marcus G.,"Chicago, IL",298,114,316.0,2.0,2017-03-16,"This is the first Red Robin I've been to, and it wasn't the greatest experience. The saying is, if the place is crowded and the lines are long it must be because the place is great. Ehh, not so much here. It's because the service is sloooow and good luck on getting your server back after you received your menu. I almost wanted to get up and leave in between that time because they take so long. This is probably why the parking is packed and the lines are long! People are waiting for the menu. When we finally ordered the food I assumed it'll be a long wait but it was pretty average time. BUT, when do get your food, try to think of EVERYTHING you need and ask them for it. Even for the bottomless fries you haven't dived into yet. If ""your thing"" is bottomless fries then it should truly feel that way. It's almost like you're bothering them for asking when that is what I paid for. The same with dipping sauces; it's like pulling teeth to get this simple stuff. I've gone to another location and it was almost the same experience but not as bad.

But that's OK because if you do not have little kids you can sit in the bar area and it's a bit more quite in there. Service was good and food was ok. Son said his bacon cheeseburger was not that great. I did taste a fry and it was not hot. Wife and I  ordered Salads with the Whiskey BBQ chicken and avocado. My chicken was OK but wife did not like it. She ate a small portion and was just going to leave the rest but I had her wrap it so that I could try it later. No desert today.

2,DeOnna B.,"Glenwood, IL",60,6,8.0,1.0,2017-07-16,"07/14/2017 I placed my order online with specific instructions including ""extra fries"".  Unfortunately, due to a past experience I now check my order before I leave the restaurant.  Needless to say I was disappointed in the quality of food.  The bun was not ""grilled"", the sauce on both burgers were a thin spread, the Black & Bleu Burger did not grilled onions nor the mushroom as expressed in the description, and the other did not include the extra fries...If the intent was to give me extra fries I wold hate to see how many fries I would have received if I did not ask!  I reminded the cashier Hannah that my order specifically indicated extra fries for both orders and that the burgers looked ""Sorry"".  Without much of a response, Hannah informed me that she would place an additional order for extra fries.... It is unexceptable that whomever packed my order actually deemed it of quality/acceptable.  Although my order is ""To-Go"" I do not want to make it home only to be disappointed that a restaurant located in my own neighborhood serves such poor quality of food!  Orland Park is known as the ""To-Go"" neighborhood for many people in the surrounding neighborhoods.  To know that Red Robin Orland Park is respresenting Orland Park in such a manner is shameful.  It's unfortunate that I no longer want to return to the Orland Park location and now have to seek another ""Gourmet"" burger restaurant in my own area.   Please improve your standards...or re-locate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park,2.44,2.75,2.75,,2.6260000000000003

Long wait for the food to come out waitress said she is super busy and apologized for the wait so the manager took our order anyway veggie burger looked very sad with very few toppings on there so we told the waitress and again she apologized took it back and told us they will re do it. We just wanted more things on there like the menu states. After another 30 min of waiting it came out still looking sad i was already done with mine and she ate hers. Overall the food wasnt so good the waiting time was horrible the place was extra dirty and the furniture looks pretty beat up.

1,Rachel B.,"Tampa, FL",47,153,600.0,2.0,2018-01-03,"Wow. Flat out - the other reviews were right! Quite possibly the worst Red Robin I've been to. Maybe even one of the worst restaurants I've been to, as well.  For starters, let's agree most adults go here for the kids. Am I right? Kids love this place. Well, even ours were disappointed. 4 kids, 3 adults visit for dinner. Walk in, no one else is in the lobby, we see empty (albeit dirty tables everywhere), and are quoted 20 minutes. (Rudely, I might add. 2 people and it took some back and forth from them to come to this 20 Minute guesstimation). Anyway, it took closer to 6 minutes for our table. A smaller group came in after us and did get a table quickly.  Our server brusquely introduced herself and I kid you not, robotically took orders. No inflection. No banter. It was ""You?"" ""Thank you."" ""You?@ ""Thank you."" So we wait. Too long. We hear servers and cooks yelling at each other. Apparently, according to one server, you practically have to kill someone to get garlic fries in the window. Pretty sure I hear an f-bomb, as well, which is always awesome in a family restaurant with an open kitchen.  Then the orders come out. Well, kinda. Kids meal with a wrong side item, adult meal with the wrong side item, side of ranch missing, my meal COMPLETELY MISSING. Had to remind the server what it was. Pretty sure it was never entered, as I then had to wait another 10 minutes for the Southern Charm burger and cole slaw. (Which, not so charming after all. Although cooked to temp, it was oozing in too much bbq sauce and the toppings weren't even crunchy at that point. So much sauce, even the presentation was lacking and t came out with sauce on the top of the bun! Like someone's hand had gotten in it!) My cole slaw tasted good, but was presented oddly. It looked like it was pre-scooped into the dish and was kinda wilty and flat on top.  Also at our table was a teriyaki Chicken Sandwich, on lettuce instead of a bun, that fell apart it was so saucy.   One of the adults had a plain burger with fruit salad. It was the weirdest fruit salad ever. Missing strawberries (so not really a freckled salad after all) and oozing in juice. Soaked. Even the apples had turned a kinda pinkish juicy color. Our server did bring more servings of bottomless fries and Mac and cheese for the kids. Of the 3 refills, one of the bowls of Mac was cold. Flat out, when the child complained and for some reason I didn't take her word for it (crazy I didn't assume t was wrong, right?), I actually stuck my finger in the bowl. Cold. Awesome. Told the server, no ""I'm sorry"" or ""Wow, let me fix that for you."" She literally looked at us and said ""Ok."" Trust me, we laughed about this in disbelief the minute she walked away. One of the kids also ordered a second helping of bottomless salad. Wound up getting an adult side salad with tomatoes on it. Of all places, Red Robin, who specializes in reeling in the kids, should know tomatoes is a no-no.  Soon after this, we heard another patron yelling at the manager. Something about waiting too long for a table and looking around and it was empty. Honestly, one of us should have walked over to her and told her to just go somewhere else - save her sanity and her money.  Our server did bring out complimentary birthday sundaes to all the kids as an apology. Gotta say, would have preferred a comped check instead of that.  I'm giving this location 2 Stars out of 5 simply because I reserve 1 Star for places that make me sick or have health violations. Save for the fact that there was no food poisoning involved, this would have been a 1. Seriously. That. Bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orland-park,2.44,2.7,2.7,,2.596
