Marlan S.,"Moscow, ID",11,6,,4.0,3/7/2015,There's no better place in northern Idaho to discuss purple dildos and Japanese sex robots. Burgers were good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20
Remy L.,"Moscow, ID",2,21,1,1.0,7/5/2013,"Two years ago, my husband and I had a bad experience with this restaurant: our waitress spent so long talking loudly to the patrons behind us (about how turquoise could apparently cure cancer if people would just give it a try) that she forgot about our food. The cook brought it out, literally slammed the plates on our table, and stalked off angrily. The food was completely cold. When we tried to mention this to the waitress, she just kept talking about how turquoise cured her roommate's acne and ignored us. No, I'm not making this up. We put cash on the table and walked out - she didn't even notice us leave! Today, we decided to give Applebee's a second chance. After all, things change a lot in two years, right? Sadly, not in this case. Please note through the review that, other than two other tables and us, the place was empty. Strike #1: Our waitress was sexist. When she came to our table, without even saying hello or welcome, she immediately delved into a story about how wonderful her 4th of July was. There's certainly nothing wrong with mentioning that you had a wonderful holiday, but this was a very lengthy and pointless story about one of her friends nearly blowing his fingers off for no reason, which she ended with ""and it's pretty much a fact that all men are stupid."" Even though neither of us said a thing, she then said defensively to my husband, ""I'm allowed to say men are stupid, because I have five brothers. I'm the oldest sister. And they were all dumb."" My husband stayed quiet, so she rolled her eyes and said, ""Okay, you don't agree? Whatever. Well, what do you want to drink then?""  Strike #2: The Thermostat. It was absolutely freezing, and a vent was directly above us. I asked our waitress if she could please turn the air conditioning down a little. ""No,"" she said, pointing at a table seated with two older ladies in heavy sweaters, ""because they asked me 20 minutes ago to turn it up and if I turn it down for you, it'll just get hot and they'll complain, and in the summer all restaurants are either super hot or freezing anyways."" When my husband asked if we could move to a table without a vent overhead, she said, ""Oh, trust me, this is the warmest section of the restaurant, and totally the warmest table, it'll be colder everywhere else."" Strike 3: Ordering. When she took our order, I asked for a burger, medium. She said, ""Oh, we only do burgers in ""pink"" or ""no pink"", so you have to pick one of those. We don't do ""just a little pink."" She didn't write down our order (one burger, a sandwich, and soup), and my husband ended up with the wrong type of sandwich. Strike 4: The Food Itself. The onion soup my husband ordered was, essentially, mildly flavored brown water with oil bubbles floating on the top and a gargantuan hunk of semi-melted cheese. We both tried a bite, but it was so bad that we shared my burger (which was incredibly pink inside, but at least tasted all right) instead. The only thing that actually tasted good was the brownie bite my husband added to make himself feel better about his bad food. I've eaten at other Applebee's locations over the years, and I've had both good food and good service from them! It just seems to be that the food and service at THIS particular location is lacking. Maybe we'll give them a third chance in another two years...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20
A F.,"Yakima, WA",14,64,44,5.0,1/23/2015,"Tried their new items, hubby got the sweet Asian pineapple burger, one of the fur kids got a kids grilled chicken with white rice and I got the pepper crusted sirloin and whole grains to go.  Two words, surprisingly good! Hubby's burger was flavorful with pineapple chunks and sweet chili sauce, for a $1 more he added bacon and looked like they used a pretzel bun, fries were a little over seasoned though. My steak was tender and a little well done, wish they let you choose the doneness on it as I like mine medium rare, grains and portobello mushrooms were a great compliment to the dish. Fur kid's grilled chicken breast was a generous portion and I couldn't stop stealing them as I was cutting them into chunks! Applebee's have definitely stepped up their game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20
Tuyaw L.,"Vancouver, WA",0,1,,1.0,3/15/2016,"Bloody Mary was the worst. Plenty of Tabasco,  but no flavor. Asked waitress how much the drinks were before ordering. But when the bill came, they were about a dollar more. Asked for a salad substitute instead of a baked potato. When I got the bill, I found that they had charged $5.00 more for a side salad, even though  I didn't have a baked patato. Manager preferred to argue rather than to please the customer.  Will never eat at this place again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20
Alisha B.,"Airway Heights, WA",8,6,,2.0,5/15/2013,"I'll start with the positive: this Applebees has a very friendly staff and great environment compared to other Applebees. I also found the appetizers to be decent. I keep making the mistake of ordering burgers at this place. Numerous times I have tried their burgers and each time couldn't get them down. They are SO dry and overcooked but I am always deceived by the photo on the menu of yummy juicy burgers. I have also had their babyback ribs and they have little meat and as well dry, overcooked. I think I have learned my lesson.... Applebee's is a fun place for drinks and appetizers but their entrees are usually so-so or not good at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20

Kelli S.,"Twin Falls, ID",32,58,,4.0,8/21/2010,"I normally am not a huge fan of Applebee's. It's always just been fine, generic food that hasn't excited me too much. But this Applebee's? I actually crave going here. For one, the atmosphere is better than any I've been to before. The servers have always been super nice and helpful, they'll actually have a conversation with you and take the time to joke around a bit. The food has been really good here. And if you go after 9pm, all appetizers are half off! The chicken wonton tacos are delicious, just don't think you're going to take them home to eat the next day, they get soggy. The spinach artichoke dip is so yummy, also.  The onion rings look SO good, I'm going to have to try them. My friends that I often go with always get the mozzarella sticks and say they are really tasty. Portion sizes here are also pretty decent! My only food complaint? They don't make malted milkshakes! Fail. Their regular milkshakes are good though anyway. I went there on a Friday night once and they had karaoke. It was definitely very lively and there were lots of interesting people there, but listening to bad singers gets a tad annoying after awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20
Kay S.,"Williston, ND",0,60,,4.0,12/19/2013,"Friends and I often come here for drinks and appetizers. Service is decent, had a mix up with the way I was charged once. I called in to have it cleared up, apparently it was the day of a big football game and the employee who answered the phone said he was sorry, but they were incredibly busy and to call back in 3-4 hours. I barely stuttered out an ""ok"" before he hung up on me. Okay, no biggie, called back in 4 hours and it got totally cleared up within a few days.

Amanda Y.,"Seattle, WA",299,322,,4.0,7/7/2009,"Straight up, this Applebee's has the nicest employees of any I've ever been in. Long story short, I was left homeless in Pullman with few friends to count on last Fall. I came here to drown my sorrows in a beer and some food. Now, I don't really care for Applebee's food, but I knew their bar had some decent drinks, so I stopped on in.  The bartender was sweet as pie as she chatted me up and I told her my sob story. The restaurant manager overheard our chatter, and noticed me watching intently the college football came on the TV, and came over and sat next to me. He talked football with me for a good while and made me feel a little at ease for the first time that day. It felt good to have someone at a restaurant reach out to poor little homeless, so far from home, me.  I had a few beers, and the bartender and the manager wished me luck on the rest of my evening. I'll be over in the Palouse this weekend, maybe I'll have to make a stop by to say hello to the friendliest Applebee's employees I've ever encountered! And the beer was great too ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3?start=20

Service is average, food is decent and prices are affordable for the most part. They do have a good deal on appetizers after 9 pm, they are half off.

Victoria H.,"Seattle, WA",112,121,53,4.0,9/24/2017,"We were traveling here from out of town,  and decided to eat here as it was close to our hotel and we had not had Applebee's in a long time as it's not close to us in Seattle, WA. This Applebee's is very delicious. We were very impressed with this Applebee's compared to other locations we had been to. It was a nice atmosphere, a mix of families and college students from U of I nearby. The service of the staff was overall great and they were kind and efficient. The only reason for the four stars was the Quesadilla appetizer did not come exactly as described and was not that hot when it came out. The server checked on us frequently,  but she overall did not seem happy.  I had the Chicken Tenders with the four cheese macaroni and it was delicious. I have had it many times before and this Applebee's served it best! My best friend had the Chicken Caesar Salad and she enjoyed it as well and it was fresh. I had the Blondie for dessert and it is so good! The Blondie is always great and I highly recommend it as a dessert to try!  Overall, it was a great experience and I recommend it if you are seeking a good place to eat in Moscow!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3

Jonathan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",271,45,99,4.0,9/7/2016,"Attention to tourists and travelers, if you are ever in Moscow and are in desperate need of food, fear not! Applebee's is here to save the day!!! In Moscow, there aren't that many choices when it comes down to food. However, you certainly can't go wrong with Applebee's. I have gone to many Applebee's in SoCal and here, the service is definitely better and more prompt. I think this is partly due to the fact that there is no one is Moscow and therefore, less customers at Applebee's, allowing the servers to be more attentive.  In terms of the food, it's just standard American cuisine. I had the honey BBQ boneless wings as appetizers. Unfortunately, they went too strong on the sauce and the BBQ was simply too overwhelming. For entree, I ordered the 8oz sirloin steak with honey pecan sweet mashed potato and garlic green beans. I asked for the steak to be medium rare and it was cooked perfect to order (see picture). The fact that it was also next to the pecan sweet mashed potato also gave the steak a gentle, sweet, smoky flavor, which was an excellent addition to the overall aroma of the steak. The sides however, were disappointing. The sweet mashed potato was wayyyy too sweet. At one point, I felt like I was drinking drops of honey. I think I should have had it along with the steak, but I ate it separately. The green beans did not taste garlicky. It was pretty bland overall. Tastes pretty much like boiled green beans in water. I would give the food 3 stars. However due to the attentive service and the fact that they actually have Applebee's at Moscow, I would give this place an overall rating of 4 stars. Thank god for Applebee's so that I didn't have to drive out 2 hours to eat decent American food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3
Rachel M.,"Pullman, WA",161,210,261,3.0,9/19/2016,Service at this Applebee's is always surprisingly great! The food is standard Applebee's food...looks great on TV and on the menu but looks and tastes subpar in real life.

Kevin B.,"Boise, ID",0,7,,1.0,8/14/2017,"We stopped in for late night happy hour before retiring to the hotel next door.  The ""perfect"" margarita was anything but.  It was godawful.  Waaay too sweet without any hint of tequila.  My companion had a bourbon berry cocktail that was equally sugary.  The entire cocktail menu was full of sugar bomb drinks.  There are several other great places in Moscow to choose over this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3
Lelee O.,"Pullman, WA",6,51,71,4.0,11/8/2015,"I came here during Happy Hour 9pm-12am (something like that) because that's when appetizers (and some drinks) are 50% off. I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip that cost only $4. It was quite tasty too. The boneless wings weren't anything special and the onion rings were crisp on the outside (but not in the inside). But that's standard for most chain restaurants so I'm not too surprised. However, the waitress was friendly and attentive which is not always a given. Oh! And the burger I ordered did have a generous amount of bacon in it which was also awesome. Overall, I'd say it's a great place to go to if you're craving affordable, decent-tasting food late at night.  There's also the 2 for $20 deal where you  can pick an appetizer and two entrees. It's perfect for when you want to split the bill between two people!  PS: I loved the music that was being played. Good vibes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-moscow-3

Although the margaritas were weak on the alcohol side (not necessarily a bad thing), the grilled steak dinner was excellent, while the pork steak with mashed sweet potatoes and garlic green beans was unbelievably good.

My daughter ordered strawberry lemonade and what ever they brought her looked like country time lemonade with no strawberries whatsoever. It was nasty and way too sweet.  My Long Island iced tea was the usual - mostly ice and not much drink.
