Tonight my parents invited me to dinner, of course Tracy doesn't have the most options and I am not a fan of chain restaurants - but I figured, what the heck. Why not Applebees! Just as I remembered it was packed with large groups and couples! They even had a hefty group of people at the bar, in which there are TVs with games and ESPN on! (a huge plus) I had steak with vegetables and for an appetizer we had the boneless chicken wings. Maybe I was just hungry - but the food was delicious. But I do have to give props to our server Christina. She was really sweet, nice and prompt!! I should come here more often! As I mentioned I am more of a independent/bistro/one of a kind restaurant seeker, but for a casual night with the rents, Applebees does the do - and the service was better than expected.

Sitting at the bar is nearly the only way to get good service. Most (not all) sitting in the main seating area gets poor service. With better options nearby, may wnt to explore your options.

So my wife and I had a few hours to spare before taking off for a road trip. o Reluctantly, I agreed to go!  Okay, I will admit, I was pleasantly suprised on my recent visit to Applebee's. Aside from the makeover on the exterior, there must have been a corporate makeover as well? The menu has been updated. This neighborhood Applebee's appears to have had a change in personnel, quality of food, taste and overall customer service. Our server was named Jennifer, as was very pleasant. Jennifer took our drink order. My wife decided on a Raspberry Lemonade, and I decided on the Mango Tea. After the first sip on the Mango Tea, it just wasn't hitting it. The Black Tea overwhelmed the Mango flavor. None the less, Jennifer changed out my drink for a Wild Berry Tea. It was more flavorful....thank goodness because I needed something that was really going to quench my thirst!  My wife decided to have their Cowboy Burger and Fries and I decided on the Jalapeno and Lime Shrimp with a Rice Pilaf. My wife claims that this burger was one of th ebest burgers she's ever had! I guess it's just my luck? My Shrimp came out with white rice instead of Rice Pilaf. It wasn't my servers fault either, someone in the kitchen just decided to put it on the side and our server corrected it immeditaely! So, will I give Applebee's another chance?

It was entertaining, and a fun twist to your regular sit downs. The thing that brang us back here time and time again were the reasonable price, and the food - the food is good. HOWEVER... my last visit here was quite unpleasant and has left me avoiding this place at all costs. Customer service is that deal breaker which brings me back to a business - My last experience consisted of slow service, the fact that WE had to ask for refills, the server nearly dropped an entire tray full of things onto my aunt, and at the end of the night they gave us the wrong bill... BUT THIS is what REALLY upset us...  we read a promotion on the table stating ""if a server doesn't tell you about our gift cards, you get free mozorella sticks"" - the server never asked us about the gift cards, and when we told her she didn't... THEY (as in she & the manager) argued with us... and we never got our mozarella cheese sticks -_-  i could go without the sticks, but come on! IT'S THE PRINCIPLE! smh. This left me with a VERY bad impression - luckily I could find an Applebees in just about every town and city - so I will not be deprived of it -  Our server was horrible, the manager was no help.

One set of silverware for a table of four and the silverware napkin was torn. We had to ask for more silverware so we could eat. Service was slow to non-existent. No salt & pepper on the table. Had to ask for steak sauce which our waiter completely forgot to bring. We had to ask someone else. Food was pretty good. I got the shrimp combo. Grilled shrimp was delicious but the breaded shrimp was overcooked. Husband got the steak. Also overcooked.

My gf and I came in for lunch on July 5th at around 12pm while we waited for our room at the hotel across the street to be ready. I was VERY impressed with our waitress Nelam. She was prompt & polite with a genuinely comforting smile. Even though we were not ""technically"" checked in at the hotel yet, she still offered us the 10% discount given to guests staying at the hotels in the close vicinity. Our waitress Nelam continued checking on us refilling drinks and such. The manger was very nice & personable aswell. He was out & about checking on his guests & stopped at our table & shared some pleasent conversation with us. My gf went to go use the restroom & rather than point the way he actually escorted her to the location... Unheard of at your typical chain restaraunts. After we were done with our meal we were still hanging out in their dining room for the cool air conditioning when here comes Nelam again with a complimentry desert for us while we waited for our room.... Oh, and the food was great too! Will most def be back here again! Again I was very impressed with the service we recieved at this establishment.

111,L A.,"Tracy, CA",3,14,1.0,3.0,2014-10-26,"So my comment is not going to be about my overall feelings of Applebees, but more of a complaint I had tonight with this one waiter in particular, DAVID: I've been a regular customer with Applebee's here in which I take advantage of happy hour with a friend. I always order drinks here and am always asked to show my ID, especially since I am well aware that I look younger than my actual age.  Tonight I was out with a good friend of mine and when I ordered my drink, our waiter DAVID asked ""are you even old enough to drink?"". I know he was probably just joking around, but I didn't hesitate to show him my ID. As I was opening my wallet he was there right next to me and looked at my cards in my wallet and made the comment ""Wow, you have like 4 ID's in there. Which one is your real one?"" At this point I got a little mad. First off, he does not know how to count, as I only had my driver's license and CA ID in my wallet... so that makes 2 ID's, not 4. Second of all, I thought his comment was really uncalled for, annoyingly sarcastic, and RUDE. I understand that they should check for ID's, but for him to have the nerve (whether he was joking or not) to criticize me (indirectly) of having fake ID's was unnecessary. And LASTLY, he did not even ask to see my friend's ID, who also ordered a drink, and is also 2 years younger than me. What the f*ck? David has been the first waiter at Applebee's that I have ever had for that only reason. Don't try to be a smart-a** and an a**hole. Overall, Applebee's is good; you get what you pay for. But I don't want David to be my waiter anymore because of his action towards me and also because I did not leave him a tip because of it. lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tracy-6?start=80,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.252,2.56

70,Sara B.,"Tracy, CA",0,6,2.0,1.0,2015-05-24,"So when first walking in to applebees it was okay. We got seated fairly quickly. When the waiter came to take our order he made everything so confusing because he was trying to split the bill right then and there. At first I was okay with it because maybe it saves him time at the end. In total we ordered 13 items for our table. Our original waiter brought out 2 items and then WENT HOME, leaving us with a different waiter who had no idea about anything for our table. We waited 30 minutes for another 4 items to come out and this is when we began to get frustrated. We then waited another 30 minutes for the rest of the items after the waitress had to ask us what we ordered. When we ended up getting the food it was cold and soggy, but that's not the worst part. We ended up not receiving 1 item at all, we decided we had been there an hour and thirty minutes already so we cancelled the order. We honestly just wanted to go home and watch a movie like we had planned.  We really got mad when she brought out the bill and she had charged us for the item that was cancelled! Also, all that time we had put in the beginning to split the bill obviously didn't matter because it came all together! This was when everyone at the table wanted to run out.  When we told the waitress about our problems with waiting an hour and thirty minutes for food she said, ""it's not my fault"" and took off. Take in mind I am not a person to blame, I was not rude. I only wanted her to fix the problem but, all we got from her was attitude.  We also told her we needed to see a manager she said,""well, we need to know the problem before we can get him,"" really? Because I've never heard of that before. So we told her the bill isn't split, ""oh, i can fix that, you don't need the manager,"" okay... Well you charged us for the item we cancelled after it took an hour and thirty minutes, ""oh, I can fix that too,"" we finally told her her no we need the manager.  When the manager did come he was handed a different receipt that didn't have the item on it, the girl had given him a different receipt than what we were handed and we couldn't even show him because she took it! The manager was also rude though! He only came over blamed us and then took off to divide the bill. Basically he just came over to shove us out as fast as he could, he did not solve any of our problems.  I usually give a place a couple of times before I decide I'm never going back but, this was my last straw. I've already had four bad experiences there.  This place has really gone down hill since Ray left, all the waiters/waitresses that used to be good at their job, now are the ones I'm saying beware to! Our waitress's name was Jessyca Y., if you get her run out as fast as you can! The manager is the problem here though, bring Ray back! It'll be a few years before I try applebees again period, unless I hear Ray's back in town because that's the only way the service and food has ever been good.

114,MC Ratio L.,"Tracy, CA",56,1,,3.0,2015-08-08,"Seating was fast, our waiter for the night Rudy got our drinks fast and had good customer service. I ordered a Spinach and Artichoke Dip for Appetizer and the Napa chicken and Portobellos, which is my go to choice. My appetizer came out fast and within 10 minutes my Chicken and Portobellos also came out, both items were hot and fresh out of the kitchen. Oh yes and I also ordered the Brownie Bite for $1.75( for that price I can never pass it up) Fast and friendly service. I was overall satisfied. The waiter did make our experience better than previous visits.  I gave an A-OK rating because of the following details. :D As many of you may know Applebee's has updated and improved their menu... Since these changes I feel that the portions of food given have changed as well. Yes this is what bothers me. I am BIG on ratios.  Our previous visit is when we encountered the new and improved menu, which to me wasn't that grand, but liking Applebee's enough, I  decided stay and order. I ordered my usual App of Spinach and Artichoke, I should add that it's Happy Hour so they are half price. I then receive my appetizer and  I am frustrated, because somehow it was not the size I remember it being. Plus my dip to chip ratio was way off. I had this mound of chips and a little bowl of dip. Not Cool. I only ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Appetizer, because I normally ONLY order that knowing that is fills me up. But they flipped the script on me when they came out with this half-sized and half-priced Appetizer. I was bummed. But I didn't say anything and just decided that I couldn't hang with the new and improved Applebee's. Then last night my husband and I decide to give them a try again. Like I stated above I had a good experience. This time around I asked the waiter before I ordered, since its half-priced will my appetizer be half-sized? He replied with an oh no it's regular size. This made me happy until it came out. Now it did come out fast and hot, which was good, but my chip to dip ratio was STILL no good. Plus the dip was filled about only half way, which left me feeling half satisfied. Then I anticipated my delicious Brownie Bite, but when it came (yes arrived fast), I was not happy with the size. I felt let down, because this too got smaller. My brownie was smaller and the ice cream scoop was super tiny. I am all about ratios and there was not enough ice cream to go along with my bite size brownie. BUMMER!!! I like having ice cream with every bite, but this didn't happen. When my main plate came out I had a BIG smile on my face. Why you ask, because the ratio was on point and this was the only thing I ordered that was the same as I remembered. I can never finish the whole thing, and I still couldn't. :D HAPPY ME. Applebee's wasn't really my go to place and probably still isn't, but with few options in Tracy, ya  gotta roll with the punches and take it. This Place is definitely a hit and miss in my book.

I can't help but feel the love every time I'm eating here! She sits us quickly everytime and lifts my spirit as I enjoy my meal amongst her presence.  However on September 13 at around 8 pm I was waiting to have my order taken by one server for waay longer than I have ever experienced. A little odd? It was pretty busy, I give them that. But I was never even told ""sorry about the wait.."" And I noticed other tables who came in later being helped before us. Hmm. Not only that but our food was a little off when we received it too. It seemed like it was just sitting in the kitchen bc it was a little cold, which never happened For my other visits here. And my server was not even the one to serve me my food even tho the rush died down a bit. The food however was still exceptional! But -1 star for that terrible service from that pale young lady with dark make up who served me.

The reason we keep the Tracy Applebee's in our date night rotation is the bartender, Krystal. She's friendly, fast and her service has never let us down. As long as she's tending the bar Sunday nights, we'll keep coming back. We also are a fan of their 'Sunday Fundays'. You can't go wrong with an all day happy hour. The rest of the staff here also seems incredibly friendly but we  only sit at the bar.  The Bad: We have a policy when we come here: never order the steaks, never order the ribs. It's actually an Applebee's wide rule for us. Thankfully their menus change often so we usually have plenty to choose from. The Ugly: No complaints on the decor here. It looks like every other Applebee's.

We order our drinks and appetizer first and then ask just for a minute to look over the wrest of the menu. She gave us 30mins. Literally by the time our drinks and appetizer was gone she came to ask if we had a chance to look over the menu,UM YES B#~%^?! Also adding;when she brought us our appetizer she said ""YOUR WELCOME"" but as if she was waiting to hear a thank you.(which we did say but she must of not herd us). Finally we order our food,a fair wait later they bring out the food and my plate was a totally different meal than i ordered. Some other lady had brought it out so i let her know i didnt think this was my plate and what i had ordered. And tryd telling it was fine tho cuz i didnt want to have to wait another 30mins for a steak to be cooked.  She quickly took it back before i can finish,okay Whatever. Then our waitress comes out and takes our drinks to get refills and apologizes for my order mix up stating she pressed the wrong button. Anyways i have to wait hella long for my correct food to come out,it comes out and she apologizes again but this time stating it was cuz she couldnt hear me.um no?! Cuz u reread my order outloud to me! Why u lien for girl?! Remind you we still havent gotten our refills back. Finaly after eating a little she comes back with my drink and my girl's drink to but...she gave her water...she originally had sprite. Now its time to pay,she cracks a small joke obviously to kiss a lil ass for that tip. Put my receipt on the table but i pull out my card and say she could go ahead and take it now,she quickly takes the reciept back,looks at it,and SWIPE goes my card on the lil tablet thing. Bypasses the amount im bouta pay and goes straight to the tip option and then hands it to me. Then takes off with my reciept. $62?!?!? Wtf was $62 at applebees?!? She walks by our table again so i ask to see the reciept. She had to go print another one cuz she through away the original(mind u this all happened within only 2minutes). As shes reprinting shes talking to her manager(she already knew she fucked up) and comes back with the incorrect charges already circled(i never said i was overcharged yet,i just asked for the receipt). She then says their gonna credit me back $8...she pulls out 8 wrinkly ass dollars and puts it on the table....dis biotch. The whole time she never once came to ask how we wer doing,start conversation or anything. Only the one time she got us our 15min wait beverage refill. Like tf?! I cought the manager eyeballing us acouple times, would have been more pleased if he had came up to personly apologize for the mulitple mix ups,but he hid in the back of the bar area most of the time. Literally not 1 employee had a smile on their face. Beside the super blonde young host,she smiled,she was nice. And then there was this black dude,i think i seen Michael on his name tag,he wasnt helping us but i saw his interactions with his tables,let me say this dudes service looked A1,this guy needs a different job simply cuz he deserves to work for a better company! You the Man Michael!  Anyways,Hoe got no tip ofcourse. And not cuz im some kinda broke ass but cuz her service sucked ass,im normaly a very generous  tipper. Realy chose apple bees to see what talent was there,im activly recruiting for positions at a high-end fashion retail store.

Then my son ordered a corn dog and fries and it was cooked so long that it was hard as a rock. There was also a big piece of lent mixed in with the fries. We hadn't seen our waiter in awhile so I got up and asked the bartender if he could order another corn dog and fries and presented him with the old one.  About 15 minutes later our server comes by and hands my son his new plate of food. No apologies were offered. I asked for two place settings and he brought back two plates. So our table of 5 only had two forks and two napkins.

Employees seem complacent about what they are doing. Yes you get greeted at the door and the smiles are great but don't seem genuine. I recommend only sitting at the bar here. It's the only way you get your order correct and your drinks quickly. Service with a smile isn't really a trademark anymore. Maybe less turn over and more customer service training is needed here.

We finally got our order in, we ordered some appetizers as we figured our actual order would take awhile. We ordered boneless wings and crunchy wings.  THEY HAD NO SAUCE ON THEM, it was as off the took them out of the fryer used an old bowl with a tiny bit of sauce on them and that was it. Anything that could go wrong with the order did.  My son asked for a plain hamburger (no cheese, no nothing). Came smothered in cheese so we sent it back. My baby back ribs were burnt and covered in BBQ sauce to hide it.
