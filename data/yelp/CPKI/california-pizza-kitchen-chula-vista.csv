Renalyn Mae S.,"Bonita, CA",423,21,61,4.0,9/29/2017,"The last two times I've been to CPK have been very pleasant. Both occasions our server was Daisy and she was very nice, helpful and would check on us occasionally. While waiting for our order, they give us complimentary bread with a side of virgin olive oil.  Unfortunately I don't like pizza, so I come here for the pasta. I get their Garlic Cream Fettuccine, which consists of garlic parmesan cream sauce with fresh Italian parsley. I also add chicken which is an additional $3, but I don't mind, because they serve a big portion. The prices for their meals are a fair amount, just like any other restaurant.    Overall my experiences at CPK were excellent and would definitely come back if I'm ever craving their pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista

J M.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/6/2017,"Well, I took my wife and son for dinner tonight, 8/6/2017, around 6pm.  I don't even know where to get started.  First of all the table they sat my wife my son and I was dirty, even the floor had all kinds of food on it. I asked them to put us on a different table.  Then we waited for a while before we saw our waitress, the place didn't seem that busy, but she seemed very ocupied and in a hurry.  She took our order which it took a while for our food to arrive.  She brought bread with olive oil,  but my son wanted butter which are had to wait a while to see her and order the butter. Which arrive arrive the same time as my son's pizza. My salad was okay, my wife found an ant on her pasta plate which she reply ""I don't know how to react to that"" Very poor customer service to say the least! . When we got the check my wife notice that our macaroni and cheese appetizer had never arrived,  which she said ""don't worry I will take it off the bill as if she was doing us a huge favor. We has visited this place couple times before,  and food was decent with average customer service.  But this time, everything went wrong, my wife and I tried our son's pizza and it was like a piece of cardboard,  no taste no flavor.

Melanie H.,"Chula Vista, CA",67,210,299,1.0,1/13/2018,"I normally LOVE cpk!!! But I went last Saturday ordered some apps and the bbq chicken pizza. Our egg rolls had hair in them and the pizza was undercooked. I don't know, mistakes happen .... I alerted our server who took away the food, she acted kind of insulted. I felt awkward bringing it up but I'm sorry I'm a germaphobe and I'm not trying to eat a pizza that the crust isn't cooked all the way through. The manager came to the table trying to be chummy with a lame excuse. He said the hair had to have been from a brush because they brush them with butter. Really? There was no butter flavor nothing ...... um. I'm not buying it. The icing on the cake was when he told me to look over at the guy at the bar who was bald and say he's the cook it couldn't be a hair..... I'm sorry but that's the bartender. I'm not a fool.

SJ K.,"Spring Valley, CA",26,87,46,4.0,1/10/2018,"This was the first time I have ever been to CPK. I actually have never heard of this place before, but we were given a gift card for Christmas. The staff was very friendly & we were seated pretty quickly. It seemed like it was starting to get a little busy after we arrived, so we were understanding with our server not getting to us quickly to check our drinks for refills. Her friendly & helpful attitude more than made up for it, & kept the evening pleasant. We got the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, along with the free bread to start with. Followed by a hand tossed margherita pizza, and hand tossed carne asada pizza, to share as a family, and a kids Hawaiian pizza & fruit for my son. Everything was so delicious and filling. Well I can only take my husband & daughter's word on the carne asada pizza since I'm allergic to onions & cilantro tastes weird to me, but they say it was delicious. We had a great experience & will definitely be back some time in the future. I wish I could remember our server's name (but I suck with names).

They have so many different options for vegans and vegetarians on the menu so I can still enjoy this restaurant! There were some buffalo cauliflower appetizers that we got and they were so delicious! I probably could have eaten five of the appetizers by myself! If you're at California Pizza Kitchen and you're curious what they taste like, order them you will not be disappointed!

Jennica S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",639,405,1367,3.0,5/5/2017,"Sometimes I forget that this ""mall"" has a CPK, but from time-to-time, I dine here for a specific craving: pasta. It has never occurred to me (until today) how lackluster their customer service is, which is surprising to say the least because they are not at all busy, ever. Even the host took me and boyfriend to our table in a blasé, zombie-like fashion. Despite the fact that their service has lowered over the past couple of years, their food satiates my carb desire. I think my favorite pasta is the garlic fettuccine alfredo with chicken, but I enjoy their tequila chicken fettuccine, as well as their pesto chicken penne. I do think they need to lessen on the oils, because it tends to get a little too greasy. Also, I can't forget their caesar salad, which is probably one of my favorite caesar's.  It amazes me how above average their prices are for such an average restaurant. Their price range for certain items goes hand-in-hand with The Cheesecake Factory, but these two restaurants are definitely not on par with one another.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista

Will probably go back next year since it's close to me and we thoroughly enjoyed the  pizza. Hadn't been to a CPK in quite some time. We tried the Italian chopped which was definitely lacking something....we decided it needed pepperoncini. Priced at over $15 but free for Veteran's day we thought it was a little too spendy. The pizza on the other hand is priced at around $15  but really tasty. We got the sausage pepperoni and mushroom which had a good amount of cheese and toppings and the crust is not oily at all. While wine seemed a bit pricey at over $10 for a 9oz pour, our server was great.

I ordered the chicken tequila pasta, it was mediocre. The chicken was a bit over cooked, and the pasta was dry. I have ordered this dish on several occasions in fashion valley mall and has never been this dry.  The pepperoni pizza was excellent. The dough was very soft, crispy and brown. A little more cheese could have been added but overall the herbs and pepperoni were a perfect addition to the excellent pizza dough. My son loved his kids cheese pizza. It was the perfect portion size for him and he even took 3 slices home.  My biggest complaint was my waitress went MIA. On 3 different occasions, we had to ask 2 servers walking by to refill our drinks, give me my check and for more napkins. She was not very attentive nor friendly at all. Not the best service.

I ordered the petite wedge at $4.65, a spinach and mushroom flat bread pizza and a fennel sausage, and poblano flat bread pizza both at $5.95. The petite wedge was larger than I expected and came with a modest amount of savory bacon, a good creamy blue cheese dressing, and some chopped eggs and tomatoes ( ). The bacon was good, chewy, and slightly smokey. ( ) It was my favorite part of the salad, second was the creamy blue cheese. The salad came with some sliced sourdough baguette which was quite good and chewy. ( ) The bread was excellent with the herb filled oil oil served on the side. ( ) Both flat breads were enjoyable to eat. They use the same dough they use for their well known pizzas. The crust on both was light, thin with a slight elasticity. The mushroom and spinach was my favorite. (  The mushrooms had a pleasant earthy overtone and were lightly cooked. Everything just gelled well together specifically the well cooked and seasoned spinach. ( ) I thought the fennel sausage flat bread was good, but not as balances as the mushroom one. Don't get me wrong, it looked great (See), and it tasted good, but the sausage was a little weak in flavor ans lacked that aggressive fennel flavor. ( ) It was a little spicy, as advertised, and the poblanos tasted mixed with the melted cheese. ( ) I enjoyed a warm tea with my meal, and the service provided by my server Brian was spot on.

Our latest dinner here was on a weekday, around 6:30, not busy at all and we were seated right away. Lots of tables, they can accommodate larger groups. Clean. Nice location, in front of AMC by otay ranch mall. Our service was good. We were checked on periodically. Drinks, ordering, and receiving our food was all within a good timeframe. We were given warm bread with infused olive oil while waiting.  The food...  Tortilla soup- tasted kinda more like a bean soup, a thick consistency, but with a little hint of Spanish flavor.. It was just all right... Mushroom pizza- yummy.. If you like mushrooms on your pizza, you will like this dish. The flavor is so rich. Yum! Crust was chewy and toasty, I believe their pizzas are wood fired...  Kids pizza/Alfredo- what my kids got. They're both generous portions and the pizza was basically a smaller version of their regular pizzas (prepared the same way)...  My fave think on their menu is the THAI CRUNCH salad. Edamame, chicken, crispy thin white noodles, shredded cabbage, green onions, peanuts, etc, with a sweet peanut/sesame flavor.. We always get the full (large) serving... 3 of us shared 2 large orders, we like it that much... I've tried it with and without avocado, both ways are tasty.  Not usually our first pick for going out... But it's a place we go from time to time when craving their Thai crunch salad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=20

My food was just sitting there, my pasta was all dry from just sitting there. The cashier (very lovely girl) was kind enough to take the pasta back to the kitchen so they could add more sauce and she said no one had told her I called to say I was already outside, so I don't blame her at all.  On a side note, when you call to place an order they always ask if you would like some bread. Every single time I ask for bread I don't get it, and when I don't ask for bread I do get bread.

She was always very attentive and had had a great attitude (wonderful customer service!!). We also ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it wasn't bad.

We love their shaved mushroom & spinach flatbread, quinoa + arugula salad, and their chicken piccata entree. CPK's chicken piccata is the one dish I compare all other chicken piccata's to! It's very good (especially when paired with a good Chardonnay wine). Their house sourdough bread served with olive oil is also delicious. Remind your server to bring some bread over if it's not automatically offered. Our service was very good the night we had dinner.

And I always get there tortilla soup, tho this is a pizza place I have to admit they have one of the best tortilla soups I've ever tasted! There Cesar salad is very good but I would ask for extra dressing tho because it can be a bit dry sometimes.  My fav pasta here is the Pesto Pasta, it's  made with the perfect amount of Pesto sauce & always well made & delicious. Now for the main reason I come here, the Chicken Thai Pizza! If my wife knew how to make this I would never argue with her & kiss her dirty feet (she likes to be barefooted in the house)  & massage her everyday & dance for her in my boxers!  Love it, comes with the bean sprouts & peanut sauce & veggies & the perfect amount of Chicken. All there pizza come perfectly cooked in thin crust & are good but this one is my favorite & the main reason why I come back. There outside patio is real nice & there bar is as well, there beer & wine selection here is pretty good. You can bring you're kids as well, there kids menu is reasonable. The prices are decent.

Christine F.,"Columbus, GA",0,8,7,2.0,9/18/2013,"Two stars is probably generous considering our experience at CPK tonight. I feel a bit silly now looking back on it...all the signs that a terrible experience was about to ensue were present, I just chose to ignore them. My first tip should have been the lack of customers in the restaurant. Sure it was a Wednesday night, but it was 6:30 and the shopping center was busy. I thought maybe we lucked out and were just ahead of the evening rush. Not so much. When we walked in we were seated promptly in a booth by the bar. There were only a handful of other customers scattered throughout the restaurant.  Our server came out quickly and took our drink order. One goose martini, one Stone IPA (in a bottle with a glass, since we were informed they did not have Stone on draft), and one lemonade. After a few minutes we look over and see our server preparing the martini behind the bar. This would not be a concern if she looked as though she knew what she was doing or it was the best drink we ever had. Unfortunately, the martini came out half empty and the beer was a bottle of Stella Artois. Thankfully I caught this before the server opened it; however, upon her realizing her mistake she also realized the don't carry Stone IPA...at all. My husband settled for a Rogue and we proceeded to order.  My mother and I decided to partake in the dinner for two special, which our server was not very familiar with to say the least...even though we all had it in our menu and it was discussed with us by the hostess. The special came with an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, a BBQ chicken salad (hold the tortilla strips), a pepperoni/mushroom/sausage pizza, thin crust (hold the oregano), and hubby ordered a garlic chicken pizza separately. We would order desert after the meal.  The spinach dip came out in record time...and that was the only part of the meal this restaurant seemed to consider time sensitive. The meal itself took about a half hour (let me take this moment to remind you again how the restaurant was not busy). When our meal finally did arrive, we were short the pepperoni pizza. The kitchen staff accidentally put oregano on it and was going to remake it. The process of remaking a pizza must be cumbersome and convoluted because my husband and I were well finished with our meals before it came out. This is also after asking the server where it was a couple times, and a visit from the manager.  After awhile we asked they just box it up since everyone was finished with their food and understandably irritated by this time. The manger brought out the box, apologized again and walked away. Our server took another ten minutes to find her way back to us to see if we needed anything further. Umm yes, the dessert we are paying for. Red velvet please. After another 15 minutes the cake came out (they must have been baking it from scratch) and we paid our bill and left.  We had $7 taken off our bill. That is what CPK felt we deserved after having the worst dinner and service we have had in at least 4 years. We will not be back.  The food was good, which landed the two stars; however, the pizza they redid still had oregano on it. We didn't feel it was worth the hassle of mentioning it, nor did we feel like they would care.  Get your act together CPK. No wonder there was no wait for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=120

The place is not busy at all, and I think customers are catching on the lackluster service here. We were seated close to the other customers, but couldn't understand why none of the servers tended to us for the past 15 minutes. After finally asking one of the servers, it took 5 minutes for us to eventually get up and leave as no one came. There were a few servers standing by the host area, and that annoyed me to a point of speaking with the manager on duty. She tried to convince me to stay and be assured of receiving good service. It was too late.

There was plenty of seating and there was no wait to get our table. We were seated immediately. Things went down hill after that.  Our server sat us down, he was super friendly. However the service ended up being completely slow after that. I tried to pass it off that maybe there were other tables that we could not see that our server was being slow at coming back to our table each time.  The kitchen staff was able to prepare our food fast. And it was served to our table quickly except for one dish that one of my friends was waiting on. We let her have some of our food since she was waiting for her pasta.  After we were done eating, we actually had to get up and walk tot the bar area to ask if someone would be able to give us our bill to pay, since our server was not coming back around to our table.  Overall the food was good as it usually is when I come to CPK. They offer these new smaller dishes that are the perfect size and price. I even went home with left overs. This was my first time at this location and honestly due to the super slow service I had a hard time giving this a good review. Although that I know that the food is really good quality at CPK.

Melissa H.,"Chula Vista, CA",219,188,36,1.0,7/15/2016,"We came here a few days ago. The place was not fairly busy. Nice crowd of families. The place was clean and not too loud. We were seated in a decent time frame. The waiter was nice and took our drink order. Off to a good start. We get our drinks and then we place our food order. Everyone decided on the BBQ and Hawaiian Pizza. I wanted to try the Chicken Piccata. All set orders placed.  Now here goes to the bad and reason for the one star. Well I'm not sure if they had a shift change or not, but we waited a long time to get our food and the waiter was no where to be found. Empty drink cups! We finally get our food, by another waiter. The pizza crust was burnt and the pizza was also cold. Not hot right out of the oven. Maybe it was sitting?? I asked to have it remade. The pasta was also cold and lacked chicken. It pretty much looked liked a plate of just pasta, sauce and capers. The NEW waiter had an attitude about it. I'm thinking well, I did come here to eat HOT food, not cold and burnt. Last time I checked I was paying for this outing so I would like it my way.  No need to make a big scene. Paid and left.

John L.,"Chula Vista, CA",509,280,612,3.0,7/6/2015,"CPK is always a solid choice for good, quality food choices. None of my recent visits challenges that. Salads are fresh, tasty, and they have a great variety to choose from. Pizzas are also top notch, original BBQ is still a classic, delicious and super fresh.  So, why the average rating. Across the board the prices are too high. Way to high. I mean $15 for a salad ($16+ with tax) for a salad that's 75% lettuce. Great salad but for over $16, the value is just not there, not even close. Same with the pizzas, smallish and $15 each.  Also, for in restaurant dining, service is spotty....for what you are paying, service here should always be top notch. It's not, sometimes, just plain horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=40
Jeff R.,"San Diego, CA",282,215,2938,4.0,6/21/2015,"Somehow I never got around to reviewing this place. I know we come here at least three times a year. It's close by but what also makes it a good deal is that you can buy $100 of gift cards for $80 at Costco.  The food while not extraordinary is good and I've learned through trial and error what I should stick with. I'm a fan of their Jambalaya fettuccine. It is nicely spiced without overpowering. Generous amounts of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, and crayfish. I also like their roasted veggie salad. All sorts of grill type veggies. I have learned though that it is not worth (IMO) to add chicken to your salad or pasta. For the extra charge it is not worth it as the portion that comes is small. We once asked and they suggested next time to ask for a chicken breast to be served along with your pasta or salad for an extra charge. My kids like the pizzas of course but not just the plain cheese. This is one of the rare places where they have ventured and ordered say BBQ chicken pizza. Now if I could just get them to order something green on the pizza (cilantro or scallions aside) I'd be purchasing stock. My wife enjoys their lettuce wraps and the chicken tortilla soup.  Today I indulged with dessert, not a norm here. We ordered the chocolate soufflé. It was okay. It's consistency was bordering brownie like. However we also got the salted caramel pudding. We've got a winner here folks! A creamy pudding screaming CARAMEL at you with a crushed cookie bottom. I loved it.  It does get busy but service has always been friendly and attentive. Once my poor child ordered a Caesar salad (the one freaking time she did that on her own) and found some sort of beetle in it. Both server and manager apologized profusely comped the dish and offered her a replacement meal (though she was so put off she declined). I really appreciated that they focused on making sure she was good and talking to her like she was an adult.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=40

My wife and I have been to CPK many times and have always been happy.  Last night, we took my mother-in-law to the Otay Ranch (Birch Road) location for the first time.  It looked busy when we arrived, but we were seated right away. Our server was Val, and she was just outstanding (and that's putting it mildly).  We had a running joke going about how awful the food was, and I even ordered the Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake for dessert ""to see if it will be equally horrible.""  Of course, this was just a joke -- the food was excellent!  I had Cedar Plank Salmon, which was delicious, and my mother-in-law ordered Shrimp Scampi Pizza.  My wife wanted the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Fettuccine, but without the Fettuccine, since she's gluten-free.  CPK was more than happy to accommodate, and even included extra zucchini (much to my wife's delight). It was when Val came back and saw our empty plates that she quipped, ""You must have hated your food,"" and thus began the whole ""awful food"" running joke that lasted through dessert.  At one point, I joked that we'd have to speak to the manager and demand a refund, and she deadpanned that she'd have to quit her job so she wouldn't have to keep feeling so bad about serving such awful food. Speaking of dessert, the Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake was awesome.  I highly recommend it. So Thank You, CPK, for a great meal.  And I would like to give an extra special Thanks and shout-out to Val, who was simply the best.  Please make sure she gets recognition for this (and you can tell her that it's coming from the ""horrible food"" trio -- I'm sure she'll remember us!).  We will definitely be back again for more ""horrible food"" (LOL).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=100

The food was OK but I did not feel the quality matched the price paid.  There are other places that serve better quality pizzas and tacos for better pricing.  The three stars is for the value.  I have read the other reviews but with my experience the staff has been rather cordial and competent.    It is not a bad place per se but not my proverbial cup of tea",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=100

I'm a former F&B Director in San Diego and Las Vegas and have been in the business for 35 years. Trust me when I tell you that I'd recommend CPK.  It didn't hurt having a consummate professional server, Cristina, who was bright, menu knowledgeable, and flat out friendly. The other server assistant, Sonia, was very friendly, too. I started with Tortilla Soup and had a Turkey and Brie sandwich. I can tell they do many items from scratch including the honey mustard dressing which was brilliant on the sandwich. They have an open kitchen and I was able to see most of the operation. The cooks work clean, they look professional, and I saw zero health code violations which is unusual in an open kitchen. My son ordered a Hawaiian Pizza but wasn't overly satisfied with the amount of cheese on the pizza. He has eaten here more times than I and said it was different this time. Well, I didn't have to go far as I see Chef Michael table touching his guests checking on every single guests satisfaction. That is so unusual in this business and it's a thing of beauty when the Chef his making his presence known. Chef obviously knows about Guest Retention! He approached and I complimented him on his manner and then told him about the pizza. He apologized and said he'd remake it personally for my son. I was watching him and he had a smile as he remade the item from scratch! He delivered it to our table when completed and it was perfect. I don't know how long the management team has been there but it's working.

First place I went was to the restroom to wash my hands (very clean) I really liked that the hostess waited to seat us all till I returned so I didn't have to play the find game. We were sat in booth as requested. So far 5 stars!!     We were sat and it took about 7 minutes before we were greeted by our server (mind you the restaurant was half full) finally we were acknowledged and told her would be right with us. After a long day all I was craving was good food and a strong cocktail. Eduardo finally returned to take our order. Simple ... Avocado egg rolls and a apple martini. He came back with waters for the table and about 8 min later our egg rolls came up ... No drinks yet. I was patient and asked another sever "" hey can you check on our drinks""? 5 min later almost done with my egg rolls nothing still. I then grew impatient got out of my seat to walk over to the bar to see what was the mystery about my drink. I think he was a manager and I told him I had been waiting for my cocktail for sometime now even pointed out where I was sitting. A couple min later Eduardo came with my drink 3/4 full. This must be my punishment for asking them where my drink was 15 min's after ordering it. The food came out hot and tasteful which is the only reason they are getting 2 stars. There were 2 managers on duty and none came to our table to check on us the entire night. It seems like their time was tied up with a guest next to us for about 20 min. Usually CPK managers walk the floor asking about the food, service and so on. I ordered another cocktail to see if this time it would be different; nope same song. I'm very disappointed with this restaurant tonight. I picked this place due to all the outstanding experiences I've had in the past with this company.

It felt like Denny's with all the booth seats and yellow accents.  At least, the service here was better! After our server took our order, she offered some bread and butter as we waited. The bread was very plain and not flavored or heated.  Then again, it was FREE so can't complain much.  Service: Our server was super nice, but she dragged at times. We often had to ask her for drink refills and other stuff like crushed chili peppers and Parmesan cheese.  Food: Server suggested I try the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli with BOTH sauces. I was like...whoo hooo both sauces sounds good to me. Yeeaaaah, it was good, but not that great. I could tell that it was microwaved because some raviolis were hotter than others. Plus, the portion wasn't that hefty. I'm a hefty girl that likes huge hefty portions :) Overall, I wouldn't highly suggest this dish.  On the other hand, I would RECOMMEND the Thai Chicken Pizza and Tequila Chicken Pasta dish.   Do NOT recommend ordering the Great White Pizza if you're going to try other pizzas too.

My friends, my boyfriend and I ate here on a Thursday night and the restaurant was only half-full. We were seated immediately..that's great, but expected. Our waitress gave us time to decide our orders. She brought our drinks, appetizer and pizza on time too. So far, so good. All this time, she looked bored. I understand if you don't like your job, but the restaurant wasn't even busy. (Note: We ate here during wildfire week, when the air quality still wasn't good. I know, we're so bad.) Even when I asked her to take a picture of my group, she seemed to fake a smile, plus the picture turned out bad! Ok, so maybe that was a rant. My boyfriend and I came back to this location a week later just because we love CPK's pizzas. Service was slightly better than last time, but still not good enough. If it weren't for CPK's crabcake appetizer, BBQ chicken pizza, and Jamaican Jerk pizza (I like this, my boyfriend doesn't care for it), I would just drive further to the Fashion Valley location for the same food with better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=180

Only reason 2 stars is because food once we actually got it was really good. Walked in at 12:50 checkout time on check 2:05pm.  Here is what I shared on Facebook: So we walked in no one greets us. Not one employee even looks at you there are like 10 tables sat. We almost walked out when the host walked up. Again didn't say one word to us ask us anything just looked at us grabbed menus and walked towards a table so we followed...He walks away. So we sit and server comes up and she's really nice. Okay so looking up. She takes our drink orders. Brings them back and takes order I asked her superrrrr specific questions about my sons food (has allergies) and she answered so I thought. ANYWAY my husband orders then I order. I got a super simple thing and for once I  didn't alter my entree at all...but it came with a side in the menu it said chips and salsa which was fine but she's like no not anymore. Came with chicken soup or a Caesar salad neither of which I will eat. I asked for salsa or a house salad? Nope wouldn't sub no matter what not even if there was a fee. I ended up asking for no side and she didn't even care. Okay so done there... She leaves NEVER comes back. Someone else brings boys food in like 4 minutes. She never comes back. My sons food is all messed up so he only eats a portion of it that he could. She never comes back. We run out of drinks she never comes back. Not one server even comes near us for me to ask for their help. None of the servers there seem to be checking on their tables you just see them walking around in the background socializing.  Our food never came out. Boys finish their meals. I finally got some random servers attn. Just for more water. The host brings it. Says not one word to us. Here's a great part. This other table is going to leave and the guy stands up and slams his head on the over head lamp not only hurting himself but breaking the whole lamp. Patrons gasp and not one employee even goes to him. Never saw a manager nothing. The bar tender just stares at him and gossips to an employee next to her. The guy just leaves the broken light on the table looks around waits like 5 minutes and leaves. Finally another server comes with our food. We ate. Still noticing no one actually working there is like even friendly or talking to any table (I've been to cpk dozennnns of times and this has never happened). We finish like literally she runs by drops check and is back to socializing with other waiter far away.  I literally just left cash and walked out.

When I called back that same day it happened the person who took my call must have known why I was calling because they wouldn't put me through to a manager. This happened a while back.  My latest visit (2 days ago) the service was lacking. No refills offered despite the fact that half the restaurant was empty and they were clearly over staffed. Waitress didn't even check on us or offer the complimentary bread. Every other table she served she offered and brought it to. While the bread is nothing special we were starving! And if she's offering it to EVERY other table what made the table that my friends and I were sitting at any different?! It really gets to me when I am nicer and more accommodating than our waiter!  Our table was right next to the register and facing the kitchen- yet no one thought to check on us.  There are too many dining options for people to treat their customers this way. A lot of good places like Niko's closed next to CPK and I am actually waiting and hoping this place does too.  Oh, and the pesto cream penne with chicken my bff ordered- it had 4 SMALL pieces of chicken in it. Pieces were so small she may as well have ordered NO chicken.

My  husband wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory as our first choice, but the 1 hour wait made us turn to CPK since it was close by. Considering it was Mother's Day, a 25 min wait wasn't too bad. However, when we were seated we just got bad service. It took awhile for our server to come by our table and when he wrote down our drinks, we didn't get them in about 5 minutes. Customers who were seated after us got their drinks before we did. Pffft.  I was waiting for our server to give us bread as they have done in the past and still nothing. I was told that we had to ""ask"" for bread as the servers no longer offer it. WHAT?! Although their bread isn't something special, my kids were starving and wanted something to eat while we waited for our meals. I ordered the garlic cream pasta with chicken and my husband ordered the meat lovers pizza. When we were served our food, I was a bit surprised. Seems like their servings are for kids. My 12 year old ordered the same thing I did and she was still hungry after eating her food. $13 for a small portion of pasta with little bits of chicken is expensive. Especially when you have to ask for bread!  I left the restaurant pretty disappointed. We spent $70 on food that wasn't even worth eating.

We then asked to browse a dessert menu unsure on what to get but definitely wanting a dessert and the waiter immediately answered ""Oh sorry we are closed."" And sets the bill on the table. Working in a restaurant before I don't understand why you would ask if that's it for tonight if clearly he already had the bill in hand and your food service was closed.

We did not order the White Pizza...and there were clearly tomatoes on it, so there should not have been any mix up. We also got the Sesame ginger dumplings...and those were good, after we warmed them up. We live 2 miles away and when we got home they were cold. Not at all warm. Disappointing experience.

To me that is saying a lot because Otay Ranch Center Mall as well as the surrounding area have a long list of places to dine. Been coming here for years. Every time California Pizza Kitchen has consistently brought real good service and food. Having a casual setting. They have indoor and outdoor dining. We have lately ordered the same two things to eat. The Italian chopped salad and the Meat Craver thin crust pizza. The only thing we deviated from our order is our drinks. I usually hate eating thin crust pizza. With the thin crust usually tasting like a cracker with toppings. But not here. The crust is chewing just the way I like it. With the added toppings of pepperoni, sausage, two kinds of ham and salami the Meat Craver is just great. Another thing I am not a big fan of is salads especially salads with garbanzo beans. But again, California Pizza Kitchen prepare it in a way that I truly enjoy eating it. The mustard vinaigrette dressing is tangy but not overpowering so you can taste the other elements of the salad- lettuce, turkey, salami, tomatoes, parmesan and of course garbanzo beans. The pizza and salad just go hand and hand. It's a great combo. Something we love to eat during lunch. I will also recommend their Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. I have eaten it in the past. Delicious. Again real good service. Real good food and drinks. The price to dine is fair. Overall, California Pizza Kitchen is a winner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=60

We told her no, but that we would like some waters. She got our waters within a minute and was back asking if we were ready to order again. Our answer was the same: no. When our food came I wasn't impressed. The peach salad I ordered didn't taste half as good as the menu made it sound. To make matters worse - the employees were using the table behind us as a break table. One of the workers kept bumping my friends chair. Once our waitress left our check, she would walk by every couple minutes checking to see if we had paid so she could pick it up. Keep in mind that this was around 9pm and the restaurant was not very crowded. After about 20 min or so, she came back and said that her manager told her to get our check so she could clock out. Are you serious?? I have never had that happen to me at a restaurant especially more than an hour before closing.

If I have extra cash in my wallet, and more people in my party, I'll also order the kung pao spaghetti. That's it! Friday night was simply forgettable. We order the spinach artichoke dip, which was good. Then we order the Thai salad-thing. It sucked ass! Major 'effin ass. It was a plate of lima beans!

The food last night was very good.  We had a Thai Crunch Salad and a Penne and Pepper dish with Bolognese sauce.  Both were delicious.   I also had a bite of a friend's Chicken Fettucine with Garlic Cream Sauce - awesome!   I've had the pizza here - it's not even close to the quality at Sammy's Woodfired Pizza.  On other visits I've the Classic Ceasar (Bland), Goat Cheese and Roasted Pepper Pizza (Bland), Sweet and Spicy Italian Sausage Pizza (Bland and undertopped), and the TriColore Salad Pizza (Weird).   If you go here, expect a longer than average service experience, and stick with the pasta - that's the best thing I've found at CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=200

Minnow N.,"Culver City, CA",85,329,99,2.0,3/27/2011,"I have never had a ""wow"" experience at ANY CPK in particular. I have never said, ""hey, let's go to CPK!"" - with that said, I haven't been to a CPK for about.... 6 years. So when my friends wanted to go there for dinner, I thought I'd give it a fighting chance.  Our group of six were greeted by a young front door hostess who hurriedly went to get a table ready for us. She seemed a bit nervous or flustered with our large group because she couldn't give us an estimated wait time. We were seated within 5 minutes, so plus points. Once we were seated, our drink orders were taken right away and our dinner orders shortly after. THEN... the wait... and more waiting. I understand it takes longer for a larger group to get their orders, but all our drinks were more than half way finished and we didn't even receive any BREAD to munch on! parties, large and small, who were seated after us all got bread and butter. My friend pointed out, ""Maybe you just have to ask for bread?"" Ok, fine, maybe they're trying to be bread-conscious and serve bread to those who ask for it... but honestly... i haven't been to CPK in a while, if this was my FIRST experience with CPK and I didn't know i had to ASK for bread and i saw others getting bread, i'd be ticked! AND I WAS! What they SHOULD do is ask if we would like bread while we waited for our dinners. I asked for bread and we got it promptly. I'm not sure if that's really their policy but it sucks. They should just ask their customers if they want bread instead of having us ask for it ourselves. Anyway, their only saving grace is that their pizzas are pretty good. I got the California Club and my bf got the Jamaican Jerk. They were both pretty good, however I wish I had some kind of ranch sauce for dipping. Their pizzas are on the dry side - not much sauce. Another minus was that our waitress asked on ONE occasion for ONE person out of our 6 person group if he wanted a refill. As for the rest of us, we had to repeatedly ask for refills. Even asking for a refill she got one out of three cups and then forgot about the other two. We had to remind her to get us more refills. Well, CPK you lose. you failed to redeem yourself despite your pretty-OKAY pizzas. it wasn't enough to overcome the poor service, bad bread policy (if there even was one - maybe she just forgot to give us bread?), and overpriced menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=160

The pizzas are truly mouth watering. *Caution: split the pizza too.. or you're end up eating the whole d$%m thing! 2. Split a salad! The salads are wonderful and the portions are very generous, even for the 1/2 size. The chicken waldorf is my favorite. The tastes and textures here are devine! Get the dressing on the side &/or ask for the low-fat/fat-free kind. 3. If you want soup, you can do half & half! The soups are yummy. If you're looking to just hang out and order a few appetizers and drinks. The place has a cool, laid-back feel. The drinks are good. They do get a little busy on weekends so don't hesitate to flag down your bartender, server, etc! Your food will also take a little longer, but it is well worth the wait.

The portions are so large that I sometimes have a hard time finishing it all. Coming from the east coast my wife and I know something about good pizza. While CPK's pizza doesn't taste exactly like the east coast variety, it is equally good. We always include a large field of greens salad with our meal. The salad includes various types of lettuce and spinach, sliced pears and candied walnuts. We love that too.

Will probably go back next year since it's close to me and we thoroughly enjoyed the  pizza. Hadn't been to a CPK in quite some time. We tried the Italian chopped which was definitely lacking something....we decided it needed pepperoncini. Priced at over $15 but free for Veteran's day we thought it was a little too spendy. The pizza on the other hand is priced at around $15  but really tasty. We got the sausage pepperoni and mushroom which had a good amount of cheese and toppings and the crust is not oily at all. While wine seemed a bit pricey at over $10 for a 9oz pour, our server was great. Besides getting our entrees comped for veteran's day, we thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary hot bread that was served with an herb EVOO...yummm.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista

A little more cheese could have been added but overall the herbs and pepperoni were a perfect addition to the excellent pizza dough. My son loved his kids cheese pizza. It was the perfect portion size for him and he even took 3 slices home.  My biggest complaint was my waitress went MIA.

Our latest dinner here was on a weekday, around 6:30, not busy at all and we were seated right away. Lots of tables, they can accommodate larger groups. Clean. Nice location, in front of AMC by otay ranch mall. Our service was good. We were checked on periodically. Drinks, ordering, and receiving our food was all within a good timeframe. We were given warm bread with infused olive oil while waiting.  The food...  Tortilla soup- tasted kinda more like a bean soup, a thick consistency, but with a little hint of Spanish flavor.. It was just all right... Mushroom pizza- yummy.. If you like mushrooms on your pizza, you will like this dish. The flavor is so rich. Yum! Crust was chewy and toasty, I believe their pizzas are wood fired...  Kids pizza/Alfredo- what my kids got. They're both generous portions and the pizza was basically a smaller version of their regular pizzas (prepared the same way)...  My fave think on their menu is the THAI CRUNCH salad. Edamame, chicken, crispy thin white noodles, shredded cabbage, green onions, peanuts, etc, with a sweet peanut/sesame flavor.. We always get the full (large) serving... 3 of us shared 2 large orders, we like it that much... I've tried it with and without avocado, both ways are tasty.

My food was just sitting there, my pasta was all dry from just sitting there. The cashier (very lovely girl) was kind enough to take the pasta back to the kitchen so they could add more sauce and she said no one had told her I called to say I was already outside, so I don't blame her at all.  On a side note, when you call to place an order they always ask if you would like some bread. Every single time I ask for bread I don't get it, and when I don't ask for bread I do get bread.

We love their shaved mushroom & spinach flatbread, quinoa + arugula salad, and their chicken piccata entree. CPK's chicken piccata is the one dish I compare all other chicken piccata's to! It's very good (especially when paired with a good Chardonnay wine). Their house sourdough bread served with olive oil is also delicious.

My fav pasta here is the Pesto Pasta, it's  made with the perfect amount of Pesto sauce & always well made & delicious. Now for the main reason I come here, the Chicken Thai Pizza! If my wife knew how to make this I would never argue with her & kiss her dirty feet (she likes to be barefooted in the house)  & massage her everyday & dance for her in my boxers!  Love it, comes with the bean sprouts & peanut sauce & veggies & the perfect amount of Chicken. All there pizza come perfectly cooked in thin crust & are good but this one is my favorite & the main reason why I come back. There outside patio is real nice & there bar is as well, there beer & wine selection here is pretty good. You can bring you're kids as well, there kids menu is reasonable. The prices are decent.

There was plenty of seating and there was no wait to get our table. We were seated immediately. Things went down hill after that.  Our server sat us down, he was super friendly. However the service ended up being completely slow after that. I tried to pass it off that maybe there were other tables that we could not see that our server was being slow at coming back to our table each time.  The kitchen staff was able to prepare our food fast. And it was served to our table quickly except for one dish that one of my friends was waiting on. We let her have some of our food since she was waiting for her pasta.  After we were done eating, we actually had to get up and walk tot the bar area to ask if someone would be able to give us our bill to pay, since our server was not coming back around to our table.  Overall the food was good as it usually is when I come to CPK. They offer these new smaller dishes that are the perfect size and price. I even went home with left overs. This was my first time at this location and honestly due to the super slow service I had a hard time giving this a good review. Although that I know that the food is really good quality at CPK.  Maybe I will go back and try this place again. It makes me sad when you get service that is below par.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=40

Melissa H.,"Chula Vista, United States",219,188,36,1.0,15/7/2016,"We came here a few days ago. The place was not fairly busy. Nice crowd of families. The place was clean and not too loud. We were seated in a decent time frame. The waiter was nice and took our drink order. Off to a good start. We get our drinks and then we place our food order. Everyone decided on the BBQ and Hawaiian Pizza. I wanted to try the Chicken Piccata. All set orders placed.  Now here goes to the bad and reason for the one star. Well I'm not sure if they had a shift change or not, but we waited a long time to get our food and the waiter was no where to be found. Empty drink cups! We finally get our food, by another waiter. The pizza crust was burnt and the pizza was also cold. Not hot right out of the oven. Maybe it was sitting?? I asked to have it remade. The pasta was also cold and lacked chicken. It pretty much looked liked a plate of just pasta, sauce and capers. The NEW waiter had an attitude about it. I'm thinking well, I did come here to eat HOT food, not cold and burnt. Last time I checked I was paying for this outing so I would like it my way.  No need to make a big scene. Paid and left.  Not sure if we will be going back anytime soon or in general.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=40
John L.,"Chula Vista, United States",509,280,612,3.0,6/7/2015,"CPK is always a solid choice for good, quality food choices. None of my recent visits challenges that. Salads are fresh, tasty, and they have a great variety to choose from. Pizzas are also top notch, original BBQ is still a classic, delicious and super fresh.  So, why the average rating. Across the board the prices are too high. Way to high. I mean $15 for a salad ($16+ with tax) for a salad that's 75% lettuce. Great salad but for over $16, the value is just not there, not even close. Same with the pizzas, smallish and $15 each.  Also, for in restaurant dining, service is spotty....for what you are paying, service here should always be top notch. It's not, sometimes, just plain horrible.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=40
Jeff R.,"San Diego, United States",282,215,2938,4.0,21/6/2015,"Somehow I never got around to reviewing this place. I know we come here at least three times a year. It's close by but what also makes it a good deal is that you can buy $100 of gift cards for $80 at Costco.  The food while not extraordinary is good and I've learned through trial and error what I should stick with. I'm a fan of their Jambalaya fettuccine. It is nicely spiced without overpowering. Generous amounts of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, and crayfish. I also like their roasted veggie salad. All sorts of grill type veggies. I have learned though that it is not worth (IMO) to add chicken to your salad or pasta. For the extra charge it is not worth it as the portion that comes is small. We once asked and they suggested next time to ask for a chicken breast to be served along with your pasta or salad for an extra charge. My kids like the pizzas of course but not just the plain cheese. This is one of the rare places where they have ventured and ordered say BBQ chicken pizza. Now if I could just get them to order something green on the pizza (cilantro or scallions aside) I'd be purchasing stock. My wife enjoys their lettuce wraps and the chicken tortilla soup.  Today I indulged with dessert, not a norm here. We ordered the chocolate soufflé. It was okay. It's consistency was bordering brownie like. However we also got the salted caramel pudding. We've got a winner here folks! A creamy pudding screaming CARAMEL at you with a crushed cookie bottom. I loved it.  It does get busy but service has always been friendly and attentive. Once my poor child ordered a Caesar salad (the one freaking time she did that on her own) and found some sort of beetle in it. Both server and manager apologized profusely comped the dish and offered her a replacement meal (though she was so put off she declined). I really appreciated that they focused on making sure she was good and talking to her like she was an adult.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=40

Everything came out perfectly cooked & we literally had all the food we ordered on our table in under 5-10 mins.

I can't believe how this restaurant trains their employees.  And finally I asked server to input my reward card number and I was told that he will, but never happened.  So I made sure that he would input after we got our bill, but he didn't.

The items looked good, so I decided to order a few items from it. I ordered the petite wedge at $4.65, a spinach and mushroom flat bread pizza and a fennel sausage, and poblano flat bread pizza both at $5.95. The petite wedge was larger than I expected and came with a modest amount of savory bacon, a good creamy blue cheese dressing, and some chopped eggs and tomatoes ( ). The bacon was good, chewy, and slightly smokey. ( ) It was my favorite part of the salad, second was the creamy blue cheese. The salad came with some sliced sourdough baguette which was quite good and chewy. ( ) The bread was excellent with the herb filled oil oil served on the side. ( ) Both flat breads were enjoyable to eat. They use the same dough they use for their well known pizzas. The crust on both was light, thin with a slight elasticity. The mushroom and spinach was my favorite. (  The mushrooms had a pleasant earthy overtone and were lightly cooked. Everything just gelled well together specifically the well cooked and seasoned spinach. ( ) I thought the fennel sausage flat bread was good, but not as balances as the mushroom one. Don't get me wrong, it looked great (See), and it tasted good, but the sausage was a little weak in flavor ans lacked that aggressive fennel flavor. ( ) It was a little spicy, as advertised, and the poblanos tasted mixed with the melted cheese. ( ) I enjoyed a warm tea with my meal, and the service provided by my server Brian was spot on.

To me that is saying a lot because Otay Ranch Center Mall as well as the surrounding area have a long list of places to dine. Been coming here for years. Every time California Pizza Kitchen has consistently brought real good service and food. Having a casual setting. They have indoor and outdoor dining. We have lately ordered the same two things to eat. The Italian chopped salad and the Meat Craver thin crust pizza. The only thing we deviated from our order is our drinks. I usually hate eating thin crust pizza. With the thin crust usually tasting like a cracker with toppings. But not here. The crust is chewing just the way I like it. With the added toppings of pepperoni, sausage, two kinds of ham and salami the Meat Craver is just great. Another thing I am not a big fan of is salads especially salads with garbanzo beans. But again, California Pizza Kitchen prepare it in a way that I truly enjoy eating it. The mustard vinaigrette dressing is tangy but not overpowering so you can taste the other elements of the salad- lettuce, turkey, salami, tomatoes, parmesan and of course garbanzo beans. The pizza and salad just go hand and hand. It's a great combo. Something we love to eat during lunch. I will also recommend their Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. I have eaten it in the past. Delicious. Again real good service. Real good food and drinks. The price to dine is fair. Overall, California Pizza Kitchen is a winner.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=60

Michelle E.,"Chula Vista, United States",4,26,47,3.0,5/2/2016,I've been here about a handful of times and I've always had an okay experience eating here. The food is good but I feel like it's a bit pricey for what you get. We ordered the Asian crunchy salad and the Pulled pork habanero pizza as well as the jambalaya pasta. The salad was the best part of the meal. The pasta was okay I wouldn't order it again..the noodles were undercooked and the flavor of the dish felt like it was lacking something. The pizza was good but nothing special it came with habanero sauce on the side which wasn't spicy at all it tasted a bit watered down.

This stuff is so good that I requested it be bottled so I could take it home. To my surprise they actually sell it and gave me two bottles I paid $4 for 2 bottles the bottles themself cost a $1 at a dollar store so basically I paid $2 for two full bottles of their dressing which is COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!!!!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=60

Minnow N.,"Culver City, United States",85,329,99,2.0,27/3/2011,"I have never had a ""wow"" experience at ANY CPK in particular. I have never said, ""hey, let's go to CPK!"" - with that said, I haven't been to a CPK for about.... 6 years. So when my friends wanted to go there for dinner, I thought I'd give it a fighting chance.  Our group of six were greeted by a young front door hostess who hurriedly went to get a table ready for us. She seemed a bit nervous or flustered with our large group because she couldn't give us an estimated wait time. We were seated within 5 minutes, so plus points. Once we were seated, our drink orders were taken right away and our dinner orders shortly after. THEN... the wait... and more waiting. I understand it takes longer for a larger group to get their orders, but all our drinks were more than half way finished and we didn't even receive any BREAD to munch on! parties, large and small, who were seated after us all got bread and butter. My friend pointed out, ""Maybe you just have to ask for bread?"" Ok, fine, maybe they're trying to be bread-conscious and serve bread to those who ask for it... but honestly... i haven't been to CPK in a while, if this was my FIRST experience with CPK and I didn't know i had to ASK for bread and i saw others getting bread, i'd be ticked! AND I WAS! What they SHOULD do is ask if we would like bread while we waited for our dinners. I asked for bread and we got it promptly. I'm not sure if that's really their policy but it sucks. They should just ask their customers if they want bread instead of having us ask for it ourselves. Anyway, their only saving grace is that their pizzas are pretty good. I got the California Club and my bf got the Jamaican Jerk. They were both pretty good, however I wish I had some kind of ranch sauce for dipping. Their pizzas are on the dry side - not much sauce. Another minus was that our waitress asked on ONE occasion for ONE person out of our 6 person group if he wanted a refill. As for the rest of us, we had to repeatedly ask for refills. Even asking for a refill she got one out of three cups and then forgot about the other two. We had to remind her to get us more refills. Well, CPK you lose. you failed to redeem yourself despite your pretty-OKAY pizzas. it wasn't enough to overcome the poor service, bad bread policy (if there even was one - maybe she just forgot to give us bread?), and overpriced menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=160

Especially the different sauces for the Rolls- OH MAN!! As for pizza, we've tried many. I've seemed to always go with Five Cheese and Tomato (YUM!!!!) and he always tries something new, but out of all, his fav is the Sicilian so far. We try to either go before 4 or after 8/9.

Here are a few of my recommendations: 1. Ask for whole wheat dough for your pizza. Anything with different kinds of cheeses will work for you! The pizzas are truly mouth watering. *Caution: split the pizza too.. or you're end up eating the whole d$%m thing! 2. Split a salad! The salads are wonderful and the portions are very generous, even for the 1/2 size. The chicken waldorf is my favorite. The tastes and textures here are devine! Get the dressing on the side &/or ask for the low-fat/fat-free kind. 3. If you want soup, you can do half & half! The soups are yummy. If you're looking to just hang out and order a few appetizers and drinks. The place has a cool, laid-back feel. The drinks are good. They do get a little busy on weekends so don't hesitate to flag down your bartender, server, etc! Your food will also take a little longer, but it is well worth the wait. Note: I wouldn't come here for their ""other"" dishes: pasta, seafood, etc. If you want seafood go to King's next door, go to an Italian place for your pasta, and if you want a place where EVERY sort of thing is delicious...

Christine F.,"Columbus, United States",0,8,7,2.0,18/9/2013,"Two stars is probably generous considering our experience at CPK tonight. I feel a bit silly now looking back on it...all the signs that a terrible experience was about to ensue were present, I just chose to ignore them. My first tip should have been the lack of customers in the restaurant. Sure it was a Wednesday night, but it was 6:30 and the shopping center was busy. I thought maybe we lucked out and were just ahead of the evening rush. Not so much. When we walked in we were seated promptly in a booth by the bar. There were only a handful of other customers scattered throughout the restaurant.  Our server came out quickly and took our drink order. One goose martini, one Stone IPA (in a bottle with a glass, since we were informed they did not have Stone on draft), and one lemonade. After a few minutes we look over and see our server preparing the martini behind the bar. This would not be a concern if she looked as though she knew what she was doing or it was the best drink we ever had. Unfortunately, the martini came out half empty and the beer was a bottle of Stella Artois. Thankfully I caught this before the server opened it; however, upon her realizing her mistake she also realized the don't carry Stone IPA...at all. My husband settled for a Rogue and we proceeded to order.  My mother and I decided to partake in the dinner for two special, which our server was not very familiar with to say the least...even though we all had it in our menu and it was discussed with us by the hostess. The special came with an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, a BBQ chicken salad (hold the tortilla strips), a pepperoni/mushroom/sausage pizza, thin crust (hold the oregano), and hubby ordered a garlic chicken pizza separately. We would order desert after the meal.  The spinach dip came out in record time...and that was the only part of the meal this restaurant seemed to consider time sensitive. The meal itself took about a half hour (let me take this moment to remind you again how the restaurant was not busy). When our meal finally did arrive, we were short the pepperoni pizza. The kitchen staff accidentally put oregano on it and was going to remake it. The process of remaking a pizza must be cumbersome and convoluted because my husband and I were well finished with our meals before it came out. This is also after asking the server where it was a couple times, and a visit from the manager.  After awhile we asked they just box it up since everyone was finished with their food and understandably irritated by this time. The manger brought out the box, apologized again and walked away. Our server took another ten minutes to find her way back to us to see if we needed anything further. Umm yes, the dessert we are paying for. Red velvet please. After another 15 minutes the cake came out (they must have been baking it from scratch) and we paid our bill and left.  We had $7 taken off our bill. That is what CPK felt we deserved after having the worst dinner and service we have had in at least 4 years. We will not be back.  The food was good, which landed the two stars; however, the pizza they redid still had oregano on it. We didn't feel it was worth the hassle of mentioning it, nor did we feel like they would care.

I felt like we were neglected the whole time. Service was extremely slow, which I am not sure why because there was literally 7 other tables sat. Drinks took forever to come, they were only waters. A different server brought the food out and we didn't see our server until the end of the meal when we were ready for our check. We wanted to order actual drinks but was over it. Why wouldn't she come and see how the food came out ? Food was good but the pasta needed more sauce. We were just ready to get out. Then we waited 10 minutes before we went to the front to pay. If we asked for the bill I would think she knew we'd be ready to pay. Guess not.

My friends, my boyfriend and I ate here on a Thursday night and the restaurant was only half-full. We were seated immediately..that's great, but expected. Our waitress gave us time to decide our orders. She brought our drinks, appetizer and pizza on time too. So far, so good. All this time, she looked bored. I understand if you don't like your job, but the restaurant wasn't even busy. (Note: We ate here during wildfire week, when the air quality still wasn't good. I know, we're so bad.) Even when I asked her to take a picture of my group, she seemed to fake a smile, plus the picture turned out bad! Ok, so maybe that was a rant. My boyfriend and I came back to this location a week later just because we love CPK's pizzas. Service was slightly better than last time, but still not good enough.

The avocado egg rolls are stuffed with pieces of chicken, mozzarella cheese, avocado and tomatoes. They're served on a large platter with two dipping sauces: ranch &amp; thousand island (I think).

(Just want to say that right off the bat in case any of the joking references below are somehow misunderstood.) My wife and I have been to CPK many times and have always been happy.  Last night, we took my mother-in-law to the Otay Ranch (Birch Road) location for the first time.  It looked busy when we arrived, but we were seated right away. Our server was Val, and she was just outstanding (and that's putting it mildly).  We had a running joke going about how awful the food was, and I even ordered the Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake for dessert ""to see if it will be equally horrible.""  Of course, this was just a joke -- the food was excellent!  I had Cedar Plank Salmon, which was delicious, and my mother-in-law ordered Shrimp Scampi Pizza.  My wife wanted the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Fettuccine, but without the Fettuccine, since she's gluten-free.  CPK was more than happy to accommodate, and even included extra zucchini (much to my wife's delight). It was when Val came back and saw our empty plates that she quipped, ""You must have hated your food,"" and thus began the whole ""awful food"" running joke that lasted through dessert.  At one point, I joked that we'd have to speak to the manager and demand a refund, and she deadpanned that she'd have to quit her job so she wouldn't have to keep feeling so bad about serving such awful food. Speaking of dessert, the Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake was awesome.  I highly recommend it. So Thank You, CPK, for a great meal.  And I would like to give an extra special Thanks and shout-out to Val, who was simply the best.  Please make sure she gets recognition for this (and you can tell her that it's coming from the ""horrible food"" trio -- I'm sure she'll remember us!).  We will definitely be back again for more ""horrible food"" (LOL).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=100

The other server assistant, Sonia, was very friendly, too. I started with Tortilla Soup and had a Turkey and Brie sandwich. I can tell they do many items from scratch including the honey mustard dressing which was brilliant on the sandwich. They have an open kitchen and I was able to see most of the operation. The cooks work clean, they look professional, and I saw zero health code violations which is unusual in an open kitchen. My son ordered a Hawaiian Pizza but wasn't overly satisfied with the amount of cheese on the pizza. He has eaten here more times than I and said it was different this time. Well, I didn't have to go far as I see Chef Michael table touching his guests checking on every single guests satisfaction. That is so unusual in this business and it's a thing of beauty when the Chef his making his presence known. Chef obviously knows about Guest Retention! He approached and I complimented him on his manner and then told him about the pizza. He apologized and said he'd remake it personally for my son. I was watching him and he had a smile as he remade the item from scratch! He delivered it to our table when completed and it was perfect.

First place I went was to the restroom to wash my hands (very clean) I really liked that the hostess waited to seat us all till I returned so I didn't have to play the find game. We were sat in booth as requested. So far 5 stars!!     We were sat and it took about 7 minutes before we were greeted by our server (mind you the restaurant was half full) finally we were acknowledged and told her would be right with us. After a long day all I was craving was good food and a strong cocktail. Eduardo finally returned to take our order. Simple ... Avocado egg rolls and a apple martini. He came back with waters for the table and about 8 min later our egg rolls came up ... No drinks yet. I was patient and asked another sever "" hey can you check on our drinks""? 5 min later almost done with my egg rolls nothing still. I then grew impatient got out of my seat to walk over to the bar to see what was the mystery about my drink. I think he was a manager and I told him I had been waiting for my cocktail for sometime now even pointed out where I was sitting. A couple min later Eduardo came with my drink 3/4 full. This must be my punishment for asking them where my drink was 15 min's after ordering it. The food came out hot and tasteful which is the only reason they are getting 2 stars. There were 2 managers on duty and none came to our table to check on us the entire night. It seems like their time was tied up with a guest next to us for about 20 min. Usually CPK managers walk the floor asking about the food, service and so on. I ordered another cocktail to see if this time it would be different; nope same song. I'm very disappointed with this restaurant tonight. I picked this place due to all the outstanding experiences I've had in the past with this company.

It felt like Denny's with all the booth seats and yellow accents.  At least, the service here was better! After our server took our order, she offered some bread and butter as we waited. The bread was very plain and not flavored or heated.  Then again, it was FREE so can't complain much.  Service: Our server was super nice, but she dragged at times. We often had to ask her for drink refills and other stuff like crushed chili peppers and Parmesan cheese.  Food: Server suggested I try the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli with BOTH sauces. I was like...whoo hooo both sauces sounds good to me. Yeeaaaah, it was good, but not that great. I could tell that it was microwaved because some raviolis were hotter than others. Plus, the portion wasn't that hefty. I'm a hefty girl that likes huge hefty portions :) Overall, I wouldn't highly suggest this dish.  On the other hand, I would RECOMMEND the Thai Chicken Pizza and Tequila Chicken Pasta dish.   Do NOT recommend ordering the Great White Pizza if you're going to try other pizzas too.

The second time was bad enough to make me not want to come back. Our waitress came up to my friend and I within a minute of us sitting down wanting to know if we were ready to order. We told her no, but that we would like some waters. She got our waters within a minute and was back asking if we were ready to order again. Our answer was the same: no. When our food came I wasn't impressed. The peach salad I ordered didn't taste half as good as the menu made it sound. To make matters worse - the employees were using the table behind us as a break table. One of the workers kept bumping my friends chair. Once our waitress left our check, she would walk by every couple minutes checking to see if we had paid so she could pick it up. Keep in mind that this was around 9pm and the restaurant was not very crowded. After about 20 min or so, she came back and said that her manager told her to get our check so she could clock out. Are you serious?? I have never had that happen to me at a restaurant especially more than an hour before closing. On top of this, both my friend and I felt like employees kept looking at us like they were ready for us to leave. This was enough to make me feel like I won't be coming back here.

Nevertheless, I stand by my assertion and I really believe that my Chicken Milanese would have been just as delicious had I been sober. Prices are only ""okay.""

The appetizer we chose where the tortilla rolls, thai chicken and mediterranean chicken. My advice, skip these. Ugh. I decided to have my Waldorf Chicken Salad and my husband got the Hawaiian pizza. Both were prepared well, as expected. What kills this location is the service, and I don't know if this stems from management or the quality of the staff.

Only reason 2 stars is because food once we actually got it was really good. Walked in at 12:50 checkout time on check 2:05pm.  Here is what I shared on Facebook: So we walked in no one greets us. Not one employee even looks at you there are like 10 tables sat. We almost walked out when the host walked up. Again didn't say one word to us ask us anything just looked at us grabbed menus and walked towards a table so we followed...He walks away. So we sit and server comes up and she's really nice. Okay so looking up. She takes our drink orders. Brings them back and takes order I asked her superrrrr specific questions about my sons food (has allergies) and she answered so I thought. ANYWAY my husband orders then I order. I got a super simple thing and for once I  didn't alter my entree at all...but it came with a side in the menu it said chips and salsa which was fine but she's like no not anymore. Came with chicken soup or a Caesar salad neither of which I will eat. I asked for salsa or a house salad? Nope wouldn't sub no matter what not even if there was a fee. I ended up asking for no side and she didn't even care. Okay so done there... She leaves NEVER comes back. Someone else brings boys food in like 4 minutes. She never comes back. My sons food is all messed up so he only eats a portion of it that he could. She never comes back. We run out of drinks she never comes back. Not one server even comes near us for me to ask for their help. None of the servers there seem to be checking on their tables you just see them walking around in the background socializing.  Our food never came out. Boys finish their meals. I finally got some random servers attn. Just for more water. The host brings it. Says not one word to us. Here's a great part. This other table is going to leave and the guy stands up and slams his head on the over head lamp not only hurting himself but breaking the whole lamp. Patrons gasp and not one employee even goes to him. Never saw a manager nothing. The bar tender just stares at him and gossips to an employee next to her. The guy just leaves the broken light on the table looks around waits like 5 minutes and leaves. Finally another server comes with our food. We ate. Still noticing no one actually working there is like even friendly or talking to any table (I've been to cpk dozennnns of times and this has never happened). We finish like literally she runs by drops check and is back to socializing with other waiter far away.  I literally just left cash and walked out.

Service SUCKS!  First time I went here the waitress charged my card twice, for different amounts and it took the manager two days to return my call. When I called back that same day it happened the person who took my call must have known why I was calling because they wouldn't put me through to a manager. This happened a while back.  My latest visit (2 days ago) the service was lacking. No refills offered despite the fact that half the restaurant was empty and they were clearly over staffed. Waitress didn't even check on us or offer the complimentary bread. Every other table she served she offered and brought it to. While the bread is nothing special we were starving! And if she's offering it to EVERY other table what made the table that my friends and I were sitting at any different?! It really gets to me when I am nicer and more accommodating than our waiter!  Our table was right next to the register and facing the kitchen- yet no one thought to check on us.  There are too many dining options for people to treat their customers this way. A lot of good places like Niko's closed next to CPK and I am actually waiting and hoping this place does too.  Oh, and the pesto cream penne with chicken my bff ordered- it had 4 SMALL pieces of chicken in it. Pieces were so small she may as well have ordered NO chicken.

We went here for dinner on Mother's Day knowing how busy it was. My  husband wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory as our first choice, but the 1 hour wait made us turn to CPK since it was close by. Considering it was Mother's Day, a 25 min wait wasn't too bad. However, when we were seated we just got bad service. It took awhile for our server to come by our table and when he wrote down our drinks, we didn't get them in about 5 minutes. Customers who were seated after us got their drinks before we did. Pffft.  I was waiting for our server to give us bread as they have done in the past and still nothing. I was told that we had to ""ask"" for bread as the servers no longer offer it. WHAT?! Although their bread isn't something special, my kids were starving and wanted something to eat while we waited for our meals. I ordered the garlic cream pasta with chicken and my husband ordered the meat lovers pizza. When we were served our food, I was a bit surprised. Seems like their servings are for kids. My 12 year old ordered the same thing I did and she was still hungry after eating her food. $13 for a small portion of pasta with little bits of chicken is expensive. Especially when you have to ask for bread!  I left the restaurant pretty disappointed. We spent $70 on food that wasn't even worth eating.

We then asked to browse a dessert menu unsure on what to get but definitely wanting a dessert and the waiter immediately answered ""Oh sorry we are closed."" And sets the bill on the table. Working in a restaurant before I don't understand why you would ask if that's it for tonight if clearly he already had the bill in hand and your food service was closed.

Richard C.,"Chula Vista, United States",2,31,7,4.0,2/12/2012,"I do not remember what the name of the dish was, thanks old age, but it had pasta, spinach, garlic and I added the grilled chicken. It had the best flavor but the pasta was a little over cooked. I personally like my pasta a little more al dente.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=140
Melina S.,"San Diego, United States",7,45,13,5.0,27/11/2012,We come here so often the servers probably think we have no food at home :)  Everyone there is so friendly & of the 458836453782 times we've been here it's always been great. Jesse the manager is awesome! He always says hi to us & is super nice. I highly reccommend the penne pasta with shrimp & the barbecue pizza.  I had to make a new paragraph for the Piña Colada. I've been to many many places to try piña coladas & NO WHERE comes close to here. Sometimes I go in & just order a piña colada. I highly reccommend it. Don't leave without trying it ! :),https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=140
Cece A.,"San Diego, United States",114,188,341,4.0,29/1/2014,We came here on a wednesday evening and we were seated immediately.  Our server was great as she kept our drinks filled and followed up on as well.  We wanted and ordered the pesto penne cream pasta with shrimp n chicken  but I guess there was a mis communication becuase we just got chicken.  We ordered a half pear gargonzola and scicilian pizza and that came out perfect.  All in all our dinner was great.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=140
Nora L.,"San Diego, United States",0,33,,5.0,28/8/2015,Enjoy this restaurant. They tend to you fast and the waiting time for the food to be served is reasonable.

Chuck F.,"Chula Vista, United States",89,130,660,4.0,27/4/2009,"We used the time after Sunday Mass to have a 'family' lunch date... I'm wasn't a big fan of chain restaurants but I have to admit I'm slowly making an exception with this place.  CPK is relatively new to the area (less than a year), I would often pass this place without giving it a second thought...  That's until recently when my daughter was presented an ""achievement award"" from her school.  It was accompanied with a voucher for a free kid's meal (with a purchase of an adult meal) for the entire month of April.  Cool gimmick but effective (during these tough economic times). Restaurant:  Nice casual experience. a great environment to meet up with some family/ friends.  Alright, I have to forewarn you...  You gotta love the kids in this place!  Kids run free as a bird in this place =)  And it's encouraged...  OMG, no more sugar!  Hahaha! Service:  Prompt and attentive (not pushy).  Manager came by and offered future meal coupons for future visits =) Food:  Wifey & I started with the chips (organic) and Artichoke dip (hearty and flavorful).  Unlimited refills on the unsweetened (house brewed) iced tea =)  We shared a pasta dish with Lemon Chicken and Capers (fantastic).  Daughter had the Mac and Cheese (bland but just fine for her).  Then, we finished our meal with a Chocolate brownie ala mode (vanilla ice cream) with all the fixins' (part of our daughters 'free' meal)...  Just enough for all of us... ...even, if it's simply just for a Sunday lunch getaway with the family.  I think you'll enjoy the experience.  We did!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=140

Cesar M.,"Chula Vista, United States",249,34,174,2.0,20/7/2013,This place really doesn't really impress me. The food is mediocre at best. I've given this place several opportunities to redeem it self and every time it falls short. Service and waiters have always been great but who goes to a restaurant just to have great service. If only the food was half a good as the waiters it would give it one more star.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=140

Gina R.,"Chula Vista, United States",8,5,,2.0,18/6/2014,"We got take out tonight. The take out service was actually REALLY great, so that's why it gets 2 stars. I think that a restaurant that has PIZZA in its name, should get the pizza right. We just ordered the Original Crust Cheese and Tomato pizza..easy right? We got home, and there was no sauce on it?!? We did not order the White Pizza...and there were clearly tomatoes on it, so there should not have been any mix up. We also got the Sesame ginger dumplings...and those were good, after we warmed them up. We live 2 miles away and when we got home they were cold. Not at all warm. Disappointing experience. Next time we will go to Oggis......",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=140
On Blast A.,"San Diego, United States",2003,198,50,3.0,10/2/2013,"When my bank account feels heavy and I feel like it needs to lose weight from all that money in there, this place is the place to go!  CPK is the weight watchers of bank accounts.  The food tastes great, but it's so damn expensive.  I always think of the starving children all over the world when I go to places like this where a small plate sized pizza costs $14.  We ordered: Asparagus & Arugula Salad Bbq chicken pizza Kung Pao Pasta A&A salad was small and tasted okay, but my girlfriend loves this dish for some damn reason.  It's just asparagus, arugula, Parmesan cheese, nuts, sun dried tomatoes and no chef's sweat in there because it's easy to make this!  you don't need to pay $4 for some salad that leaves a homeless man starving after he eats it.  As for the bbq chicken pizza and kung pao pasta.  Both were great.  Rich flavor and not bland at all.  The pizza had that bbq zing you expect and the pasta had that msg kick.  The kung pao pasta tastes like a high quality Chinese dish that married an Italian noodle.  I like it a lot, but not love it.   As for the service.  The guy was polite and did everything he needed to do, but was obviously computer illiterate.  He said he ran my card twice and it didn't go through, you'd think that they would punch in the number manually, but that's too much brain power required outside of cleaning tables and serving dishes.  Sorry for doing that to you buddy.  Don't want you to strain your brain.  So he comes back and tells me my card is declined.  Well if my card is declined I would have had a notification on my phone and email telling me my checking balance fell under a certain amount.  It was far from it.  I txt BAL to my mobile banking number and it tells me, ""Your server is an idiot, tell him to run the card manually and don't give him a tip.""  Morale of the story, don't expect your waiters to do anything beyond what they're mentally capable of doing.  I still gave him his tip, but suggest he take extra classes at the community college located near by to help him put some wrinkles on that grey matter of his.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=140

Candy F.,"Chula Vista, United States",0,2,,1.0,16/7/2013,"Im a patient person. I worked as a waitress. I understand that sometimes it takes a while to get some drinks, or that its not always the waiters fault if the food is slow or bad. But it is a different story when you dont get service at all.  I went in with my mom, willing to try something new. We were seated and excited as we had heard great reviews about the place. Nope.  We sat there for ten minutes and NOT ONE person came up to us, not even to get us drinks. They were not busy. It was the middle of the day, before lunch. We asked 3 people for drinks but no one got them. We looked around to see if we had to order somewhere or something but sat down when we saw THE TABLE NEXT TO US get seated and served drinks.  After 20 minutes, we asked the hostess if someone was going to served at all and she just said, your waitress will be with you in a moment. Hah! Five more minutes, and we had Paneras. Horrible service, so i cant tell you how the food was.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=140
Elo B.,"Chula Vista, United States",0,81,3,5.0,18/10/2009,I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at any of their locations but this one is always very accomodating and the food is good. I think they have a wide enough variety of foods to allow one to eat something different depending on what they're craving.

J. W.,"Bonita, United States",0,6,,5.0,28/6/2010,"Whenever I look for a restaurant my primary concern is with value. It doesn't have to serve the cheapest meal in town, but I need to get good value for my hard-earned dollar. I consistently find that at California Pizza Kitchen located at the Otay Ranch Mall. I generally alternate between their Ginger Salmon and their thin crust Margherita Pizza. They provide a generous slab of salmon which I enjoy with their grilled asparagus and spaghettini with creamy lemon caper sauce. The portions are so large that I sometimes have a hard time finishing it all. Coming from the east coast my wife and I know something about good pizza. While CPK's pizza doesn't taste exactly like the east coast variety, it is equally good. We always include a large field of greens salad with our meal. The salad includes various types of lettuce and spinach, sliced pears and candied walnuts. We love that too. CPK's manager Jessi, has done an excellent job of selecting servers that are helpful, friendly and attentive. Today's server, Brian, was a perfect example. Overall, CPK is just a well-run establishment and one that we visit often. We never leave disappointed.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-chula-vista?start=220
