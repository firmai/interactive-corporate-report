Emily S.,"Vista, CA",17,9,2,4.0,7/30/2010,"Almost every CPK I've been to has been great including this one. My family eats here regularly, since it's a short drive and isn't italian or mexican food *which seems to be the two dominant food types in Vista*.  The two things I order from here most often are the Thai Crunch Chicken Salad and the Spinach/Asparagus/Tomato Spaghettini. I've always enjoyed the Thai Crunch however the past 3-4 times I've gotten it to go it seems to slowly shrink more and more in size. It's become mostly chicken with some salad, but not a substantial enough amount for me to feel full once I am done And last time they forgot the crispy noodles!!! Still a great salad but if ordering out I'd go with the full portion instead of the half. The spaghettini has always been pretty great, however when I tried it with salmon it tasted a bit dry and boring. Oh, the frozen lemonade is pretty good as well...however I've had better in the past. The few times I have eaten at the restaurant the service has always been prompt and the staff have always been very friendly.  All in all, this restaurant is a good alternative to the other greasier/fast foody type joints in Vista.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Marcus F.,"Escondido, CA",257,1904,3188,3.0,2/12/2010,"Five thing to know about the VISTA CPK. 1 - Good plan ""B"" when Famous Dave's is too busy. 2 - Always reliable ( Sammy's and Pizza Nova can't say that) 3- This is a loud restaurant. Good if you have kids, not so good for elderly folks. Lots of arm gestures and "" What??"". 4 - Salads are dressed effectively. Never over dressed, nice, flavorful, and never heavy. 5 -* BULLSHIT FLAG* Stay away from the Thin Crust Pizza. they charge an extra 1.50 to flatten your pizza. This thin crust tastes no different than grocery story frozen pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Amanda R.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,205,205,4.0,10/16/2009,This location never disappoints. Don't be fooled by the full parking lot this place is huge inside. I've never had to wait to be seated here. I love the architecture of the inside of the building. Everything is so sleek and open. The main area can be completely packed but with the airiness of the room you don't get claustrophobic at all. I usually get a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza here. Split between my dinner guest and I it usually works out to 3-4 pieces each. They do add a $2.00 charge for splitting the Pizza flavors though. Just enough so that I am full but not busting my pants open. Their fresh brewed tea is good too. My waitress/server Alyse kept my glass full through the whole meal. I'm usually a fan of salads but most of the ones on the menu here are $12-$15. A little to much for an average salad on most nights for me. Especially since most of their salads come with romaine or iceberg (read yuck). The Jamaican Jerk pizza has a little bit of spice to it with smokiness from the Bacon as well. Mushroom was just plain yum.  1 1/2 Jamaican Jerk Chicken 1/2 Mushroom Pizza + 2 Iced Teas  Total Bill + Tip = $24.00,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
William B.,"Oceanside, CA",22,260,137,1.0,3/16/2010,"This is based upon a carry out order. Well if you want pizza exactly like the frozen type at the grocery store, this is pretty close to being exactly like what you can get at the frozen section. This being my first time at a CPK, I was very underwhelmed with the brief experience and am not likely to come back. I ordered a Sicilian to go, figuring it's a good pick to pit against any other pizza I have had.  What I got was a smallish pizza, which given the price, was understandable, but not being much bigger than a frozen one?   The taste was pretty bland, again reminding me of a frozen pizza, and really did nothing to make me justify going out to pay for that again when I could get nearly the same thing at a grocery store freezer section. In all fairness though, I should return and try a sit in experience sometime and go for a greater sampling of the foods here, but given my first experience, I don't know that I'm ever going to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
jennica h.,"Vista, CA",1,5,,2.0,9/3/2010,"I usually always love CPK, in fact I have never had a bad experience there. But tonight was different. I ordered hot chocolate with Whipped cream. They brought lukewarm almost cold ""hot chocolate"" with foam, no whipped cream, it was so bad I had to ask them to heat it up and put whipped cream on it. They told me they would bring me another one, well they brought me another lukewarm foam hot chocolate. The pizza we ordered had raw onions and raw mushrooms just thrown on so when you picked up the pizza it just fell off. The desert was blah, overall I was very annoyed and disappointed. I Don't think I will go back to this specific CPK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Dee M.,"Vista, CA",669,814,2965,4.0,6/22/2009,"Nice Friday night casual atmosphere before or after a movie at the neighboring Krikorian Theatre.   The drinks are great and if you want to try something different,  order the Adobe Chicken Chowder - It is absolutely delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Will T.,"Vista, CA",0,13,10,4.0,1/10/2010,"Yes, the drinks are great. Try the Chopin vodka martini with olives. Friendly staff. Reservations are for 8 or more. No WIFI, but strong 3G for both at&t and Verizon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Maureen F.,"Temecula, CA",5,24,2,1.0,12/28/2010,"Not exactly the best place to eat! The portions are super small and the prices are high. I ordered the mediterranean plate, and it was so small! There were a couple of pieces of pita bread, a few dabs of hummas, and some type of coleslaw or salad----not impressive. My friend got the vegetarian pizza and it looked like a child's size. She paid 14 dollars for that thing!!!! What a rip off! I will never dine there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Joshua R.,"Cathedral City, CA",11,43,14,5.0,7/19/2010,"Pizza may be italian, but California Pizza Kitchen is hitting the nail right on the head. Yum! Lots of selection. My daughter had a burger and fries and such. My son tore up a chipotle chicken personal pizza. It was great. I had a grilled vegetable snadwich with portobello. The szechuan slaw on the side is magical. And my other daughter had a personal pepperoni pizza, simple but scumptuous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Peter D.,"Vista, CA",0,33,8,2.0,4/6/2009,I don't know what the big deal is about this place.  I am a big pizza eater and was horribly dissapointed by the overpriced crackers served here. The salads are much more impressive looking than the pizzas.  Maybe they should call it the California Salad Kitchen?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Chris T.,"Vista, CA",19,127,26,4.0,7/23/2010,"Clean, good service, nice atmosphere and quick for a good meal.  Try the Chinese Chicken Salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Mandy D.,"Carlsbad, CA",115,30,,5.0,1/26/2010,I love the four cheese and tomato pizza. Granted I can't always eat at the restaurant but I find the frozen pizza at the grocery store excellent and eases my hankering for CPK.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Cheryl B.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,49,,4.0,11/25/2008,Pretty atmosphere.  Great place for a client lunch.  I love the chinese chopped chicken salad that I got.  It was one of the best I've ever had.  Really flavorful.  Everyone I was with got salads and enjoyed them.  I'd like to go back and try something else if I could control myself from getting another chopped oriental chicken salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
John H.,"Vista, CA",1,14,3,1.0,3/17/2010,I am sorry but this place is nothing but overrated and overpriced. I went here once and got a pizza that was way undercooked after I waited an hour to get it. I have no desire to ever go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
Deanna C.,"San Marcos, CA",207,289,292,5.0,12/12/2008,"I used to work in the UTC area and loved going to CPK with friends for lunch.  Was thrilled that a new one opened in Vista (even if they didn't hire me! LOL)   It's a nice atmosphere and a one of the 1st with a new concept of a long bar area to seat people.  I was in a rush to go to work tonight so I called in an order (yeah, I have them on speed dial!)  I ordered the BBQ chop salad, Sicilian pizza and Vegetarian pizza.  I pulled up to curbiside and a gal came out, took my money and brought me food!  Even threw in some bread with butta!   Got to work and surprised my friend with the vegetarian pizza.  When she opened it I was jealous!  It looked great!  She loved it.  I shared my salad and pizza with some other friends.  They enjoyed it as well.  So whether you're dining in or out!  Hit CPK!   Cheers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-vista
