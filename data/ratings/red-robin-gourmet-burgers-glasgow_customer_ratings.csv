And if a burger doesn't have pink, it's overcooked!!  I also like the garlic parmesan fries.  On previous visits I have had the Whiskey River burger, the A.1 Peppercorn burger, the Bruschetta Chicken, and the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad, but the Burnin' Love burger is my favorite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow?start=20,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003

Our server, Lynn, was one of the best we have ever had at this chain. She was pleasant, attentive and had the food delivered in a timely manner - which was important because we intended to see a movie at the theatre next door. When I mentioned that fact to Lynn, she offered to get us discount tickets from the front desk (which saved us a few bucks), way to go Lynn! Excellent customer service skills, Red Robin should be proud. The food was well prepared, burgers tasty and fresh.

We went to the bar for drinks and appetizers. Sean came to our table pretty quickly and took our drink order. They only had enough iced tea for one of our orders, but were told they were freshly brewing more. 20 minutes later still no drink. Our appetizer came pretty quickly, but when we asked Sean for more chips and refills on our drinks, he disappeared for 10 minutes. My husband ordered a margarita and they either didn't use the right mix, or the mix was bad. After waiting 45 minutes our table still wasn't ready. Sean brought refills, no chips and didn't clear any of the dirty dishes.  After an hour and a talk to the manager we were finally seated. We ordered dinner and it came out quickly.

I've realized that is how they get you on the bottomless fries deal, they just never come back around where you can ask for more fries, so you are finished with the rest of your meal before you could possibly get anymore.  So a good 10 mins after that she finally brings a plate of fries out and we just tell her to take them back away because why on earth would he want them now, we are ready to leave and wanting our check.   We get the check and walk to the front rather than wait for her to find the time to come back to our table (she was NOT busy was just missing in action, hiding in the back somewhere or something, she only had one other table that we could see besides us).  I handed our check and credit card to the host at the front and asked if he could take care of this for me because we were not waiting on her to come back, and instead of asking if anything was wrong or if he could do anything for us, he just takes the check to her with our cc and they run the card and he brings me the receipt and has me sign and tells us to have a good night.  Didn't have one ounce of concern that we were upset and felt no responsibility to inquire or offer to get someone to talk to us.   Will NEVER return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow?start=20,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

This wedgie is not painful at all. It's dropping the bun on your burger and using two wedges of lettuce instead. It also comes with tomato, onion, pickles, bacon and Guacamole. You can actually drop the bun on any burger. I had a wedgie chicken sandwich. It was really good. The bar is a full bar and you can get just about anything. The Kids menu is like 10 options. It is a good selection. Also the sides on the kids menu is endless. So they can eat endless fries or endless fruit. Adult sides are all endless.

15,David R.,"Elkton, MD",3,26,2.0,3.0,2017-06-06,"As usual, I don't write reviews unless it's really great service and food or something went wrong. Well, this is the latter of the two. I stop by for lunch and order my Burning Love burger. Server asks how I would like it cooked. I told him ""Well done, burgers (ground beef) should always be well done"". Well, that's what went wrong! My burger comes out and I bite into it, totally pink inside. Of course they redid my burger. In the meantime, the server and mgr come out several times to apologize. I appreciate the apologies, but I'd rather have my food done right the first time. Plus I was pressed for time and had no wY to take it home as I was on my bike, so I had to gulp it down. Then I get my check and was surprised to find that there was nothing deducted for the mess up. Had there been, that would have eased the pain of the situation. I still tipped the server as usual because it wasn't his fault. But I might have tipped more had they discounted the check a little. I still have them 3 stars because the food was great once it was cooked thoroughly. Sorry Red Robin, but I'm looking for a better burger joint to replace you. That was strike 3, lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

9,C W.,"Dover, DE",1,10,,1.0,2017-07-15,"I hate giving bad reviews but this one is deserved. The place is very LOUD. You can't have a conversation while dining. The food WAS barely ""passable."" But then my daughter found a hair fried onto a french fry (which was no surprise since the cook had a heavy beard and wasn't wearing any netting over it). She quickly lost her appetite. The burgers tasted like they were frozen and recently thawed. Once we were served, the server never came back over to check on us until it was time to get our check. She never asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks, even though our glasses were sitting there empty. Instead she asked if we wanted more (hairy) fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
8,Cheryl T.,"Bear, DE",4,11,,2.0,2017-08-06,"On Friday, August 4, my husband and I took our Grand daughter to lunch.  I haven't  been to Red Robin's in a while.  We were not please at all with the service.  I will not  give the waitress name but I do remember it.  My Grand daughter ordered the pasta she says to us look there is a hair in my food.  We had to ask other waiters to help us. The waitress assigned to our table wasn't very attentive.   We were not satisfied with our food, I don't know what happened because in the past our food at Red Robin's was usually good. We decided at this time, we will not be back to Red Robin.  We have been good  customers for a while, we have our rewards card to prove it.

1,Janille D.,"Glen Mills, PA",28,61,284.0,2.0,2017-08-28,"I came here with coworkers for lunch and decided to take advantage of the beautiful weather by being seated outside. After being seated, a server came by with menus and drinks.  We each put in our orders--two salads and a wrap. We assumed it wouldn't take very long to prepare, but we were waiting for at least 30-35 minutes before our food came out. When my salad finally came out it looked less than appetizing. The description for the southwest sombreo salad reads:  ""A Southwest classic with a twist-Ancho-grilled chicken breast, black beans, avocado, fried jalapeño coins, red bell peppers, onions, roasted corn, cilantro and lime on a bed of mixed greens. Topped with a crunchy tostada sombrero with Cheddar cheese and jalapeño spread. Served with salsa-ranch dressing"" Not only did my salad take forever, but it was missing avocado, and probably had 1/2 tsp of every other topping. I basically was given a giant bowl of iceberg lettuce with fried jalapeño and overly seasoned chicken. Also, corn was not roasted, but instead reminded me of sweet canned corn. The sombrero looked like what you would get if you sprinkled cheese on a tortilla and put it in a microwave to melt. Don't get me wrong, I love melted cheese and I love tortillas, but this did not impress.  The server took a pretty long time to come back and check on us, so we decided to just get up and ask to be rung up.  I've heard decent things about this place, and I was luckily in good company, but my first visit wasn't a great one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glasgow,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
