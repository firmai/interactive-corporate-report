Nicole B.,"Detroit, MI",19,6,,5.0,11/30/2014,I gave the restaurant  6 stars  for their  great customer  service. My order wasn't the best but they didn't  hesitate  to fix the problem. They also have the best Texas cheese  fries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate?start=20
Jennie B.,"Lincoln Park, MI",2,17,1,5.0,6/6/2013,"This is my favorite restaurant. The service is always great and they do not mind picky orders. I love that it's clean and the ambiance is great and what you would expect for a restaurant/bar. If you like fries,I highly recommend the Texas Cheese fries. Not only are they an appetizer but they are big enough to make a meal out of (you can do a half order as well). For entrees, the chicken bacon ranch quesadillas are the best! And to finish it off I love the molten chocolate cake is superb!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate?start=20
Kay D.,"Farmington Hills, MI",1,1,,5.0,4/27/2015,Service and food at this location are always great!  I love sitting at the bar because all of the bar staff is amazing. They updated the interior and added a ton of TVs in the bar area and dining room. It's my go to spot when my Tigers are playing. They also have a great late night happy hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate?start=20
Shawna F.,"Monroe, MI",26,183,288,5.0,4/21/2012,I love the crispy chicken. It's a thick moist outside and the honey mustard is wonderful. The wait staff is hit or miss as far as good and the drinks are hit or miss too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate?start=20
Richard S.,"Canton, MI",15,202,321,4.0,12/23/2013,"I wasn't a big fan of Chili's, because I don't care too much for the whole Mexican theme.  However, we tried it, and I was pleasantly surprised.  They have a menu as expansive and diverse as any casual restaurant.  We ordered the 2 for $20 meal, which I must say is immensely better than the same deal that Applebee's has.  Their steak was delicious, and they have much better side items.  I got mashed potatoes and corn on the cob; the corn was huge and perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper.  The steak was somewhat small at 6 ounces, but it was very good.  It also came with an appetizer, which we had the thing of cheese fries with the jalapenos.  The beer was somewhat pricey ($4.75 for a 24 ounce glass).  We went later in the evening and received excellent service without a single problem at all!  There's a lot of places to eat around here, and this place makes the list of places I will gladly visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate?start=20
Gerardo Q.,"Inglewood, CA",22,86,13,3.0,4/1/2012,"Ate here, the service wasn't that great as the other places we've been to. The food was salty and the waitresses kept coming up and asking questions if everything was ok as if they were quietly rushing us. Will think twice again before eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate?start=20
David K.,"Belleville, MI",20,152,,3.0,12/18/2011,As far as Chili's go its good.  Beware the sodium content tho.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate?start=20
Paige H.,"Southgate, MI",0,3,,3.0,10/26/2014,i Really love this restaurant.  the only complaint i have is when i come here on busier nights and theres a long wait despite the obvious open tables. i asked the blonde manager if they were understaffed and she said they had as many staff as they needed sarcastically.  if i wasnt starving and going to the movies across the street i would've walked out.  which a couple behind me did. whoever owns this location should understand people are in a hurry these days and to wait 20 minutes while staring at empty tables is bs. on a good note the wait staff is always friendly and accommodating and the food rocks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate?start=20
Rodrigo T.,"Lincoln Park, MI",323,792,2219,4.0,10/1/2017,"I want my baby back, baby back, baby back... I want my baby back, baby back, baby back... CHILI'S!!!!! Baby back ribs!!! Yes!! Yes!! And YAAAAASSSSSS!!! They've come a long way,, ups and downs and day drinking with the presidential margaritas. Oh Yea! We came to eat something because my sister's boyfriend is celebrating his birthday month. So off to here Flavors were really good, but I felt like everything in this dish came out of a box. Which is probably not surprising. The Belgian waffles already has syrup in it as well. But don't get me wrong,, this dish is strong As Fark! Anyways, the service was really good. I had a great time eating and shooting the breeze with my fambam. Our table was cleaned, our drinks were refilled and we were well taken cared of. I like this Chili's because it's the closest proximity to my house and never have I ever had a bad experience here. Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps you with your choice. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Dee R.,"Romulus, MI",0,5,,1.0,11/2/2017,"Was there today November 1st around 6pm and sat in a booth, our waitress made up wait about 10 min before she came over and got our drink order. Then we got our appetizer before our drinks. No side plates with it, no napkins. Needed drink refills.  I asked for salsa for my meal and watched her walk around for about 10 min aimlessly before she brought me salsa. Asked for the box and the bill and then made us wait another 10-15 min before she came back to the table and asked if we were ""good"" and STILL DID NOT have box or bill. Finally had to ask another girl for a box left $45 on the table (bill was around 40 bucks) and left, and being a bartender/waitress I have never left under 20% tip, but this girl didn't deserve even a penny, but left a couple bucks so she could tip out the bartender for the drink I got. I have never in my life been so disgusted with a way a server treated my boyfriend and I, I would rate this place a ZERO if I could. Wish I could have named dropped, BUT she didn't even give us her name probably to avoid post like this. Worst thing about it, I didn't see a single manager on the floor the whole time and NO ONE ONCE came to our table to check on us.  -Sincerely   A very pissed off customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Perry B.,"Southgate, MI",29,14,2,4.0,9/18/2017,We did the 35.00 dinner for two which wasn't a bad value Appetizer to share Two full size entrees from a selection of 8 to 10 choices Dessert to share Two Presidential Margaritas,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Ellen B.,"Wyandotte, MI",30,9,4,2.0,9/28/2017,"Meh is right. I used to come to Chili's with my family fairly often and was never really upset with what I ordered. That was until my mom and I went not too long ago because she was craving their chicken nachos and I wanted some fried pickles. Now I know the pickles at chilis are marinated with garlic, but I did not expect to get fried garlic cloves with my pickles. I am a fan of garlic but the cloves took up space that could be filled with more pickles. Also, there were bits of spinach in my pickles too, that seemed odd to me. The nachos were sub par, the tortilla chips were tough and the chicken was bland. And it's 89 cents for an extra side of sour cream? Geez. If I ever come back it'll only be for your dessert, which is remade so can't get messed up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Kristen S.,"Waterford Township, MI",29,5,,1.0,8/2/2017,"If I could give 0 I would!  Waitress was rude and mouthy!  Actually said ""sorry, I suck at life!!!""  She actually left another table while taking their order to get the manager since we were still talking about her comments!  I said please get the manager, I would love to talk to them.  Manager ""Ara"" gave the excuse that she's young!! Food came out smelling so rank!  It wasn't cooked initially (chicken fajitas) We will NEVER go here again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Jim U.,"Southgate, MI",1,125,13,4.0,11/14/2016,Average Chili's restaurant.  Service was good and they weren't too busy.  Happy hour is basically standard.  I have been to Chili's in a few different states and I was surprised to find the chips and salsa weren't free during happy hour here.  We used to go to Chili's 2-3 times a month back in California for the chips and salsa and just have a few beers.  I would be a regular again if they brought that back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
James J.,"Livonia, MI",45,82,159,4.0,4/2/2016,"My wife and I stopped in to this location for lunch today while in the midst of making a number of stops at different stores. Our server was very pleasant. We ordered the tableside guacamole as an appetizer, a salad for my wife and I ordered a steak. Unfortunately, we were still waiting on the guacamole 15 minutes later and was going to cancel the appetizer because our entrees would soon be served.  We were very disappointed because I make guacamole enough times at home to know that it is only a few minute endeavor. Nonetheless, we asked another employee to tell our server to cancel the appetizer. However, that message didn't get passed along because our server appeared a few minutes later with the appetizer. When told our server that we were going to cancel it but since she was at our table with the avocados to go ahead and make it. She apologized for the delay and made the guacamole for us. When she returned with our entrees she told us that she had shared our concerns with the manager and they agreed that the wait was too long and that they wouldn't charge us for the guacamole. A short time later, the manager, Jamie, came to our table to apologize for the delay and offer us the appetizer for free. What started out as a disappointing experience was made much better by the actions of our server and the manager. As a result, we'll return to this location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Gee S.,"Romulus, MI",0,27,,3.0,7/28/2017,"My family and I when to this Chili's for dinner. I got the fajita with prime rib and shrimp. The dish came out smoking hot and I soon discovered that my prime rib was burned. When I say burned, the meat had that scorched taste when I put it in my mouth. My daughter got the chicken tender meal with corn on the cobb. When she bit into the corn, she immediately realized it was cold. Not cold because it sat on her plate for awhile, but cold from being in the frig. It has not been cooked. She asked for another which came out nice and hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Tara M.,"Southgate, MI",0,15,,2.0,2/25/2017,"Food was horrible my kids barely ate my friends kids barely ate. We had a table of 8. We were there 2 hours and our food was aweful. I ordered a simple sirloin medium and shrimp. My sides were wrong and NO shrimp. My steak was a hockey puck. They immediately brought me someone else's dinner, which was cold. My husbands dinner was BURNT. Our friends steak was way over cooked. I tried to tell our waitress the issues without looking for any discount and she argued with me. I told her I wasn't looking for a comp but they need to know.... she argued with me. So then the manager Brenda came over and comped a lot of our meal but how dare the waitress argue with me! I can cook all this food better, so you damn well better succeed what I can do at home if i come out to pay for it. Thank you Brenda",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Sultan A.,"Southgate, MI",2,7,,4.0,1/30/2016,"I have never had a dish that I never liked in this place. Their soup is simply amazing.  Try their baked potato soup with chives and green onions. Wow amazing!!  They have good lunch menu, which can save you money.  Plus, they have reward program that gives you a point per dollar, you can redeem them when you reach around 90 by getting a free appetizer, which is amazing for me :)  I recommend this place to all of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Kim W.,"Trenton, MI",0,5,,2.0,11/30/2016,"Well we were sat down. 10 minutes before someone came to take drink order. I ordered chicken enchiladas. Yum! They delivered chicken quesadias. What!  I didn't have time for them to remake my meal. To their credit, they did take my meal off the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
M T.,"Trenton, MI",0,2,,1.0,11/30/2016,"Not sure of the bartenders name but every time besides tonight we turn around at the door and leave when we notice her working. We thought tonight we would give her a chance, our mistake.  Not friendly at all.  She couldn't even take the time to brush her hair...bad appearance.  And when dealing with the public that's very important.   Drinks were terrible, more salt at the bottom of my margarita than on the rim. The appetizer we ordered was all over the plate and upside down.   While sitting the bar we had to ask a waitress for napkins she promptly brought them to us.  My advise to anyone going here, look at the bartender as you walk in.  If it's this girl LEAVE!!  The owner of this place must have to much money not to care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Louis J.,"Flat Rock, MI",36,67,43,3.0,1/26/2016,"Food was awesome. Service was okay. Sat at the bar. A party with 10 kids came in to the restaurant. All the kids used the bar area as a nursery and play station. The manager was too busy working and not managing. So all the people at the bar had to listen to the kids playing and yelling. The manager needs to understand, ""LEADING"" comes first before being a worker bee. Our eating out experience sucked due to the debacle. :((",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate

Eman S.,"Riverview, MI",0,27,1,1.0,4/24/2016,"I placed an order to go and I ordered their Texas cheese fries, well I said no bacon and guess what there was bacon. So when I said something to the cashier she said that they will remake it she takes it back, literally one minute later she comes back out it looks like they only picked it off and added more to cover u. As I inspected it further I noticed little tiny pieces of bacon. So had this been a food allergy they would've been responsible for my death. You do not just pick off something that a customer told you not to put on in the first place, so then she goes back and they remake it but of course it's not as full as the first one and honestly I don't think I trust it because they can be pretty horrible in the back kitchen. I would have left but I paid first before checking. So beware those of you who have food allergies beware, do not eat at Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate

Tee O.,"Southgate, MI",0,10,,3.0,8/19/2015,I'm not a complainer but I've given this place 4 tries and every time I sit at the bar I get awful service from a robot type bartenders!!! She just looks mean unpleasant and like don't bother me!!! Every time I ask a question she is curt and very short very unfriendly and under no circumstance is she a people person! She is def in the wrong biz. I too am a bartender and have been for 16 yrs and I understand we all have a bad day but when a guest leaves me a 20-40% tip I always remember them and try to show my gratitude. Also on another occasion I spoke to the mgr about donating for a friends fundraiser with metastatic cancer he originally told me it wouldn't be a problem however when I called back to pick up the items he informed me he wasn't able to do so! I won't be coming back to this place there just not into customer service...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
Ara K.,"Farmington Hills, MI",2,1,,5.0,4/27/2015,First I want to say that I'm not a big restaurant chain person but this place was awesome!  If you haven't been at a Chili's in a while I urge you to check them out as they revamped the menus with new fresh items as well as update their look inside. I was promptly greeted at the door by the hostess and I was seated in the bar area. The waitress we had was amazing and the food was top notch. Be sure to check out this place!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southgate
