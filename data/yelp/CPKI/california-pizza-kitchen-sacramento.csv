Wanda G.,"Sacramento, CA",134,216,427,5.0,12/18/2017,"I can't believe I've never written a review about CPK Arden Fair! I come here all the time. It's one of my go to places in this part of Sacramento. Plus it's a good central location if you're meeting friends from different parts of town. It's in the part of the mall down by the movie theater. Lots of parking. Tip: Park in the back!!  I love how they have remodeled the restaurant. Lots of wood and textures. It feels very hip and modern, but cozy at the same time. I kind of wish my house looked like this place! LOL.  I always have great service here, even when it's very busy. When it's quiet I like to hang out and write or work on my phone. No one bothers you.  Great cocktails. I like the Honey Sangria....MMMMM. My go to food options are the Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushroom pizza or the Pesto Cream Penne with Chicken. Also, try the corn guacamole!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento
Aileen M.,"Elk Grove, CA",20,47,184,4.0,8/21/2017,"Upon walking into the restaurant for lunch, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a table right away.  I loved how bright and wide-open the design of the seating area is   Our waiter, Austin, was wonderful.  He took our order quickly, brought us some freshly-baked warm bread and dipping oil while we waited for our food, made sure to check up on us throughout our meal, and made sure our glasses were always filled with water. We shared an order of baked Tortilla Spring rolls: one Mediterranean Veggie roll (Wild mushrooms, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, Mozzarella and Parmesan. Served with marinara) and one Thai Chicken roll (Peanut sauce, bean sprouts, scallions, carrots, fresh cilantro and Mozzarella. Served with Thai peanut sauce.)  It was a bit pricey for two rolls.  I liked both of them but preferred the veggie roll's milder flavor. We also shared a pizza: the California Club which featured applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, and topped with avocado, wild arugula, fresh torn basil and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayo.  While I loved the chewy, toasty crust, I didn't really care for what was essentially a salad on top of my pizza!  It was difficult to execute: biting into my piece of pizza without the loose arugula falling off.  After the first slice as-is, I had to scrape the greens off.  But, what was left behind was a sauceless piece of pizza with noticeably salty bacon pieces.  The pizza's ""sauce"", a tasty lemony mayo, was on the greens that I'd scraped onto the butter plate!   But. The balance of flavor was restored back to the pizza after Austin kindly brought us a side of that mayo and we spread it on like butter!  I'm glad we tried the pizza, it tasted good except for the overly salted bacon. The execution was interesting but I'll keep my salads and pizza separate next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento
Karli D.,"Elk Grove, CA",91,340,768,3.0,7/31/2017,"I have not had a meal at any California Pizza Kitchen since I was young enough to order off the children's menu!  By that comment, you can deduce it has been quite some time since I have returned.  Low and behold, I decided to meet my friend here today for lunch.  I will say, the decor and ambiance were nice.  The restaurant and the bathrooms were both very clean and well lit, which is a plus.  I was not greeted upon arrival at the restaurant and instead saw myself in to the table my friend was already waiting for me at.  We ordered drinks to start until we decided to split the garlic chicken pizza and the full Caesar salad.  We asked for the caramelized onions to only be placed on half of the pizza, as my friend does not care for onions.  Instead there were onions on the entire pizza and only scallions on half.  So my friend was disappointed and decided to eat the salad instead.  The Caesar salad had great flavor and the Parmesan was fresh; I even enjoyed the butter croutons, a nice touch.  After, the waitress did not come back ever to refill our water glasses.  She lost our check with the credit card for awhile before she scrambled around the restaurant looking for our paid check.  She was not the best waitress and didn't seem like she cares to really try at her job (don't think she wanted to be there).  Overall, for the price I don't think the quality was up to par and the service is definitely lacking.  Do not plan to return here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento

The waiter forgot to refill our drinks but i don't blame him he was awesome; they were super busy and didn't think they were going to be busy so they were understaffed. Overall great job!

Karen K.,"Elk Grove, CA",1445,1118,18539,5.0,6/26/2017,"Omgosh I can't believe I haven't frequented this restaurant sooner!  It's classy, minimalistic & modern. All the elements I like in a lovely restaurant. Plus parking out front is free & endless. When we first entered we were taken to a booth by CPK's hostess right away with no hesitations. Our male waiter was just as quick asking what we wish to drink. Brought us our waters with lemon & their house bread with olive oil. We ordered half salads: Thai Crunch with no cilantro & Quinoa with Arugula. I asked specifically if the Thai Crunch was spicy the waiter said no. When I tasted it it was a bit spicy but luckily the waiter made sure my water was filled. Our half salads were more than enough. I can't imagine getting a full salad! That would have been way too much!Anyway I thought my Thai Crunch salad was perfect in taste and crunch. I would order it again definitely. Hubby enjoyed his quinoa & arugula salad & would order his salad again. I sampled his salad twice and thought it was tasty.  The waiter checked on us twice. Second time asking if we wished to have dessert. I passed this time but maybe next time! I have to admit our first time here the service & food were impeccable. Even a second person checked on us. That rarely happens! You know what? We will be back sooner than the time I waited to try this restaurant. Don't ask me why I waited. Too much CFA? Maybe. We need to cut down there for sure!

Helen H.,"San Jose, CA",10,232,194,3.0,5/3/2017,I tried the Lemongrass Chicken and was not impressed. The bok choy that it came with was not thoroughly washed as I could feel dirt particles crunching in my mouth. The flavor was more Americanized and I did not smell any lemongrass scent or see signs of its use. The plate was tiny for a fairly pricey dish. I guess I should just stick to pizza. I felt very comfortable sitting and eating inside the restaurant. It was very clean and spacious. There is plenty of arming as it is in a mall. Customer service was good. My waiter asked if I wanted bread prior to bringing it out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento
Grace B.,"Sacramento, CA",266,642,466,5.0,2/19/2017,My daughter was ready to leave for college again after winter break and so we went out a lot to eat.  I decided to take her here and we ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip and I had the Jambalaya Fettuccine.   The waiter was extremely nice and he always returned to check if we were ok or if we needed anything else.  5 stars for that.   The food came and I enjoyed the Spinach Artichoke dip.  The chips tasted fresh and the dip was so creamy.  So delicious. I couldnt stop myself.  Usually I control myself because I know I need room in my tummy for my main dish. The Jambalaya Fettuccine was also delicious.  It loved the spices.   I had a great experience. I would definitely return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento

I doubt CPK will be so easy to venture into in a month.  Comfortable seating.  Quick and friendly fun service.  The ""Reviver"" beverage was a hit.  The Lemongrass Chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The bread was hot and the dipping oil/seasonings were perfect.  I do recommend this restaurant if you're at Arden Mall and are looking for a nice restaurant to enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento
Shane K.,"North Highlands, CA",90,96,82,4.0,7/29/2017,"I definitely like to come get a gourmet style pizza at California Pizza Kitchen the drinks are always pretty good I think it's a little on the pricey side but who isn't these days, and the seating is a little tight but not overly done. I don't come here too often only because of its location from my house, but they never let me down I've been going here for several years now and all I have are great things to say.

Misu S.,"Davis, CA",141,37,34,5.0,7/21/2017,"I haven't been to a CPK in years, since my 6th grade birthday party or something and I love ""new"" ambiance and the feel. Walked in at 8:30 on a Thursday night and was seated immediately. Our server Terry was so friendly and he gave us the perfect amount of time to decide on drinks and then to order. I ordered the agave mojito and it was both delicious and strong. The food came out very quickly, and I was pleasantly surprised because the quality was much better than I had expected. The BBQ chicken pizza was chock full of toppings and the crust was cooked perfectly. Not too soft, nicely crispy. We also ordered the garlic fettuccine Alfredo and we added mushrooms. I loved that the pasta wasn't overly saucy, because most places tend to drown their pastas in sauce.  All in all it was a perfect dinner. I actually can't believe that this CPK experience was so different from my past one like a decade ago!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento
Jermaine C.,"Torrance, CA",284,232,391,5.0,7/3/2017,"6/30/17 Surprisingly, this place was above my expectations. We came here during lunch time and were sat right away. Our server was very friendly and personable; he told plenty of jokes during our visit. He talked us into ordering a couple of drinks due to the hot weather. I was surprised that the sangria flights tasted pretty good. Happy my girlfriend was there to order it because I probably would never order that for myself. We decided to take advantage of their lunch specials which were just the right amount of food at affordable prices. The food was out very quickly and prepared to perfection. We bother were able to order to items each with our alcoholic beverages for under $40. In my opinion that is a geat deal. Overall i had a great experience here. The food was amazing, the speed of service was fast and every interaction we had with the staff was genuine.

Chelsea D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",233,63,83,4.0,8/12/2016,"This is truly one of my favorite pizza places ever. I pretty much get the same thing every time I come here too.  They offered us some bread and oil to start while we looked at the menus. The oil has a distinct mixture of herbs in it that makes it fantastic. We also usually get the hummus and pita bread appetizer. The hummus is very good because it's simple. It's not like most kinds you get from the grocery store, it's very plain and I like that. For dinner I also keep it simple with just pepperoni pizza. Their thin or regular crust is very good. In the pizza they sprinkle another herb for flavor that is so unique to their restaurant, I've never had it like that anywhere else. Again, I really love it it's what makes California Pizza Kitchen so edgy and different. The staff was very friendly and always is every time I come here. Last night we sat at the bar where we could see the guys tossing pizza dough and putting the pizzas in the fire oven. Really neat environment to have dinner in and is why my boyfriend and I love it. I do have to mention, although it's silly, my chair was broken last night and I was rocking back and forth during my meal. No big deal, I could've moved over, because we were the only ones sitting at the bar, however it seems like if a child or elderly person got that stool it could be dangerous. The meal is a little pricey I have to say. Last night we skipped the appetizers and drinks, we only had water. For two pizzas we paid almost forty bucks. That's why I gave four outta five stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento
Jeanice S.,"Sacramento, CA",269,271,424,4.0,2/26/2017,"Love their garlic cream fettuccine. It's enough saltiness and creamy flavor. I like how they don't overpower the pasta with chunks of cheese. The noodles they used weren't the extra fat ones, which I like since the noodles were just at the right softness. The shrimp was cooked to perfection, but I wish the tail wasn't on there, since it made it a little tougher to get the whole shrimp. The amount they give you is a good amount. Their BBQ chicken pizza was okay. It was a little salty, but there was enough ingredients on top and the crust wasn't too thick or thin. I wouldn't choose to order it again... I may just not be a fan of pizza that much. The Brussels and bacon flatbread was nothing out of the ordinary. I would save your appetite for the real meal instead and pass on this dish. Oh yeah, happy hour from 8:00pm-CLOSE :) I would actually come back here for their garlic cream fettuccine only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento

an l.,"San Jose, CA",90,188,283,2.0,2/27/2017,"Came today after many years of not being in the retail sales working next door to dine for lunch with my gf.  I've always loved their chicken avocado egg rolls as well as their chicken tequila fettuccini.  They have definitely stepped up their game with the interior remodeling.  Everything was bright and vibrant with wood accents.  I love anything wood decor.  Unfortunately, that was the only good thing about the days visit.  My gf drinks a lot of water and we always had to ask for water refills.  Even when they saw that she was empty, they would state they would get her some more water... but no water ever came.  Our fettuccini was undercooked.  Some pieces of the pasta were harder than other pieces and barely had any of the creamy sauce I remember loving.  I mentioned it to our waiter which was kind enough to offer us something else in which we declined.  We were on a time crunch so we did not have time to wait for a new dish or something else and we hate being those that send items back.  Our avocado egg rolls were super salty which was super disappointing because I had just raved about them to my gf before ordering the dish.   Overall, food was disappointing.  Service was mediocre for only having 1/5 of the restaurant full.  I used to think CPK was different in not tasting like a chain restaurant but they've definitely killed my vibe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=20
Jamye Amy Z.,"North Highlands, CA",18,11,10,4.0,11/18/2017,I have an hour both very excited to try this place for the first time. We got lunch special with the Mediterranean salad and sausage mushroom and pepper any pizza. I got the fettuccine with shrimp. The menu said nothing about it being cooked all done today but let me tell you that was barely cooked. I waited for the man who brought our food over to our table which were not our waitress. And he was very very rude. We had asked him for the dressing that came with my husband salad and some more bread and he never came back. I looked around after I tasted my pastor to see if the man or a waitress was coming back and neither of them were. I seen our waitress in the bar area so I approached her and asked her if she could please ask them to cook the pasta longer. So well I guess she was telling the manager and seeing if they could cook it longer my husband shared his lunch with me because he felt bad that my fettuccine was so awful. The manager brought my pasta back to the table and stood there and said he wanted me to try it why he was standing there to see if I liked it that this time. And he said Att told me at that time that it is known that they put their pasta at dente. Well not only was it not cooked the second time when I asked told him he said well if I take it back again it's going to be mush and I said OK that's fine I cannot eat the pasta like this. Not only was it still hard but it was cold and I don't understand if they cooked it some more how could it be called? So by the time it came back the third time I had shared his lunch and was basically finished. When it came back the last time it had no white sauce on it at all . The managers but there again and I told him it was fine that we just wanted our check So he said that he took Alfredo off of our bill which was nice. He gave me a box to take it with me. When I got home it was nothing but a pile of noodles with barely a drop of sauce and no fresh Parmesan cheese very very disappointing.I ended up throwing it away but the pizza and salad or very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=20

Lots of ""uh"" and ""well"" and more ""uh""... and I got put on hold - all three times - so they could go find an answer, or a clue, or a brain, or perhaps a small pebble to play with.

I guess that is some powerful insight into the lack of brain skills there are behind all those 2+ star reviews. They either don't expect much or are lying.

Natisha R.,"Elk Grove, CA",21,50,76,4.0,3/11/2017,"I go here occasionally especially when I am around the Arden area. I have the same usual that I always order which is the Kung pao spaghetti with chicken and shrimp. It is my favorite because of its unique flavoring and battered shrimp and chicken. When I ordered it last night, portions of chicken seemed less compared to before, not sure if they are changing the portion size. My friend had ordered the garlic cream fettuccine with both chicken and shrimp which surprisingly turned out to be a great dish. The plate was packed with flavor and endless shrimp. That was the first time we ordered it and will definitely order it again; although, it would be complimentary if they had some sort of garlic bread to pair with the pasta. Our waitress was pretty exceptional, she kept checking in on us, offered some of her recommendations, and overall was very attentive.

It's been quite awhile since I've eaten at CPK, but I did order the same pasta as last time because I remember really liking it. The chicken tequila fettuccine was yummy! It's such a unique taste for pasta and usually I'm not a big fan of pasta to begin with.  Overall, experience here wasn't bad at all, food was good, and service was good.

Ray L.,"Folsom, CA",359,213,275,4.0,11/15/2015,"I usually shy away from writing reviews on chain restaurants, but after my visit to CPK yesterday -I just couldn't help myself. Like most self proclaimed "" foodies"" , I tend to seek out family owned restaurants that are different from the norm. Since it is in my nature to "" fight the man"" , I would rather spend my hard earned money supporting local businesses rather than add to the bottom line of corporate giants. However, sometimes I need the consistency and selection that a place like CPK offers. Here is my recap from my visit yesterday: 1. For Lunch , I chose "" The Works"" which is CPK's version of what I have always considered a ""combination"" pizza (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, red onion, green peppers, and olives). The tomato sauce  was flavorful , and was spread evenly throughout the pie. The cheese to toppings ratio was perfect, and CPK managed to not burn the crust despite being on the thinner side. With a dash of red peppers and parmesan cheese -my meal was complete. 2. My wife opted for the two-in-a bowl soup combination. The fact that both soups were served in the same bowl without some sort of divider surprised me a little bit. I expected some sort of customized bowl that prevented the 2 soups from intermingling. However, my wife made it work by eating the split pea soup first , and the baked potato soup after.  * Since my wife is pregnant , she couldn't stop there -lol. She also ordered a petite wedge salad that was on the menu under "" small plates"". The salad comes standard with blue cheese dressing  (she opted for ranch dressing instead) , bacon, egg, and tomatoes. The lettuce was not soggy,  and there was just enough dressing added. The attention to detail at CPK is amazing. The pizza, pasta, and salads are well crafted, and the ingredients used are top-notch.  CPK doesn't make the best pizza or pasta that I ever had, but they do everything well. When you are in the mood to eat but are not quite sure what you want, I would suggest giving CPK a try if you haven't already. However, since CPK operates in 30 + states- I am pretty sure you have tried it at least once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=20
A W.,"Richmond, CA",0,22,,5.0,11/11/2017,"5 stars specifically for the manager's (Bob) excellent customer service and keen eye. Had a great meal the food was awesome and the service was fine until we paid our bill and then decided we should have dessert on the spur of the moment. My sister politely asked the bartender, who was immediately in our line of sight because we were seated right next to the bar, for a dessert menu as our waitress had already left because the bill was paid and she thought we were leaving. Well his reply was so nasty that my sister was on the fence about whether or not we should ever go back. His tone, his body language and even his words gave the impression that he just could not be bothered. Bob to the rescue. He noticed the interaction from a distance. He came over and intervened in the conversation between my sister and the bartender in the most professional of ways. He was all too willing to take our order and even had a recommendation for how to save a relationship because the Butter Cake is absolutely to die for and would surely be worth a fight for the last bite. You know how you can have such a bad experience that you completely write off a business for good and nothing can fix it? Bob fixed it.

Kim F.,"Sacramento, CA",36,82,59,2.0,9/18/2016,"Been to numerous California pizza kitchen in different cities and state, but this location was a no go for me. As I entered, we got sat down immediately. There was a certain booth I wanted to be sat at but most were empty but tables were filled with dirty plates. So we got sat right underneath the sun. Mind you it was 98 degrees today.  Ordered an avocado egg roll for an appetizer, chipotle chicken pizza, and my fiancé ordered a chicken fettuccine pasta. At first they served us bread and got our appetizer fast. As we finished it, we set it aside for them to pick up when we get our main entrée. But when we got our food, she ignored our plates. Wasn't much room on the table to share our food with each other. The avocado egg roll was good but my pizza was just mushy. I couldn't lift it up without the topping falling all over my plate. Since the toppings were heavy, the pizza wouldn't hold up right even when I fold it. The dough was still chewy. And my fiancé pasta dish just looked so sad and unappetizing. He said it was bland and the chicken had no flavor. This pasta dish was about $16, not worth it. I had come in at a time where it wasn't busy. my waitress just took our order, didn't check up on us, nor could I find her. I was in need of more water since the pizza was spicy but since she was not around, I had to take my fiancé drink. Although he needed a drink too, he insisted on me having the last sip. Then she appeared out of no where to give us our check, but before she can walk away, I asked her loudly for more water for both of us.  Overall it wasn't that great for me.

Wedge salad to start followed by two (thin crust) pizzas:  * pear and gorgonzola   * spinach and artichoke Not very impressed with the wedge salad.  Dressing was blah, bacon was chewy, and the lettuce hadn't been shaken (still very wet) creating a pool of water. The pizza, however, was impressive.  The crusts were cooked well, toppings distributed, not over loaded.  Just enough to capture the flavor and texture combination of each.  Plenty left over and carried home.

A perfect compliment to the salad. The pizza was mushroom, pepperoni and sausage.  Not particularly generous with the toppings and nothing especially notable about the taste or texture of the pie.  They only offer three pizza choices for the lunch special, which is unfortunate because they offer other, more interesting options under the full size pizza menu.  There really is no reason that they can't make any of the pizza's in the 7"" personal size pie and I wish they would offer that option.

The tomatoes on the 4 cheese pizza taste so amazing and juicy that if you REALLY HATE tomatoes , just listen to me, don't take them out! The food here is beyond amazing.

With one bite into The Works, your taste buds will get pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, red onions, olives, oregano, and of course mozzarella. The crust and bottom of the pizza is crispy for that extra crunch. There are many other combinations of pizzas for you to choose from and each pizza has 6 slices so leftovers are highly probable. CPK also has appetizers, soups, salads, pastas, main entrees, and desserts. There is a bar where they serve wine, mixed drinks, and beer.  Of all the times I have been here, service has been great which made the visits more enjoyable. They refilled drinks, got us extra items like ranch, napkins, red pepper flakes, and cheese.

They've got small plates, appetizers, salads, sandwiches; everything a regular chain restaurant would have.  Thanks to Yelp, I was able to get a free small plate after registering and downloading the CPK app. I got the the petite wedge with bleu cheese, bacon, tomatoes, and crumbled egg. At first, my friend and I thought it was a potato wedge with all of those things, or maybe a a batch of potato wedges. It was actually a just a wedge of iceberg lettuce. It is literally just a lazy person's salad. Just a wedge of lettuce with all of those things on top. Nothing special at all, but hey, it was free so I can't complain. My friend and I decided to just share one of their original hand-tossed pizzas; the original bbq chicken. This pizza had their ""legendary"" bbq sauce, smoked gouda, red onions and cilantro. The pizza was good, but I have had a lot better. If anyone wants good pizza, I would recommend pizza rock on K street.  Honestly, the best part of the pizza was when we asked for parmesan cheese and the red pepper flakes. The parmesan wasn't the usual form that comes in a packet, it was actual parmesan cheese that was grated. Sadly, besides the service, this was the best part of my meal.

So far I'm still good at 4 times within a two weeks period. OY! Arrived at 7PM with a party of 11 total. Busy night for CPK. We had to wait around 15 minutes, during the wait, we were given a free appetizer of artichoke dip (yay and yum!). We were shortly seated afterwards. Customer service: 5 stars! Everyone was attentive and super friendly. They all attended to our questions and needs. TIPS: -Download their CPK app and create an account to get a free ""Small Plate"" I uploaded a menu of it. Max is 2 per a receipt, but they were friendly and gave us all 3 dish for free :) -If you sit by the pizza bar you get to watch the cooks at work, flipping dough and whatnot! -Free wifi Food: Spinach artichoke dip- The dip was nice and warm. Tasty. The chips were so-so, regular and purple colored chips. Pesto Cream Penne with shrimp- The pasta was sort of hard. The shrimp was big and flavorful. Portion is big enough for one or two people if you're splitting something else too. Overall, it was decent. Chicken Tequila Fettuccine- Had an unique taste to it, like a thai flavor. It was different from the normal pasta dishes we're used to. Hawaiian Pizza- my dad's must on a pizza is pineapple. They use fresh pineapples instead of ones from a can! So weird! All their pizzas are hand rolled! It was good agreed by everyone that tried it. Wild Mushroom- includes truffle oil. Didn't get to try :( But it was the first pizza to get snatched up! Didn't hear any complaints, so it must've been decent to delicious! Spicy Chipotle Chicken- didn't want to try. Heard it's a tad bit spicy, nothing you need to down a cup of water. Looks like there are a lot of different toppings, like a burrito exploded on a pizza haha Garlic Chicken Pizza- it's not on their menu but on the front page. It's one their popular pizza. I like this one a lot :) Our bill came out to be a bit over $100, not including the 18% gratuity they charged. Overall, I would come back again, for their service and food.

Alissa T.,"Sacramento, CA",473,174,1368,4.0,10/25/2013,"I always thought California Pizza Kitchen had pretty decent food. About 15 or so years ago you could find me at the bar seating eating the Fettuccini with Garlic Cream Sauce add mushroom.  To this day my parents frequent this place and I often tag along.  Recently they have been updating their look. Wood floors, a new bar (apparently one will be a pizza bar and the other will be a bar strictly for alcohol). While walking past one evening we spotted all the renovations going on (they were still serving); so my father walks in and they said not only will they be getting the new bar, but they are going to be getting something like 6-8 new TVs in there! They have moved away from the bright yellow upholstery to a lime color. They aren't done renovating, but what I did notice were the cute painted pizza boxes have been taken down... I always loved looking at those. So we want in to dinner last night an they have offer these new flatbreads. I ordered the bianco: truffle oil, cheese, basil... YUM! We also ordered the spinach dip; they definitely stepped up their game on the taste of this dip, I don't even really remember the last time I had ordered it from there, but it was delicious!  The bread they serve is way better and it came with an olive oil dip! I'm glad some things didn't change though. I had the Thai crunch salad, still very delicious, but now I can actually enjoy eating the bread!  Way to go California pizza Kitchen!!

We arrive & the greater said it would be a minute. Cool. We got seated soon after & boy was that an awkward walk to our seat. The lady was walking super slow & way too focused on who knows what. She didn't seem to be working at all. No hustle. And the stares on our way to our seat was so uncomfortable.  We looked at the menus & the reason why we chose this place was bc we wanted pizza. So we ordered the California Classic I believe (name might be wrong) and we substituted the bacon for pepperoni.  The wait time was fairly long. And it was not worth the wait. It arrives and it's a small round thing with a bunch of lettuce on top. What? I didn't know I had ordered a salad on my pizza. It has no sauce, just lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, some sort of really thin chicken & pepperoni. Maybe bc I'm not into eating healthy food but boy I had never tasted a pizza so bland in my life. It literally had NO flavor to it. I wish we would have just gone down the street to BJs and had awesome pizza for a little higher price.  The waitress only came around one time to ask how we were doing.  Then she called us ""kids"" when she brought the bill. What? Anyways. Probably won't be back here again. Well definitely not for pizza.  The only reason I won't give them one star is bc it's probably our fault for not liking healthy pizza.

Throughout the meal, our server was prompt and attentive without being obtrusive.  The only negative for me were the TVs. I'm already not a big fan of televisions in anything other than a bar.

Service is usually superb, and everything we order is always delicious and on point. Recently, it was a spontaneous girls night, and we decided to grab some dinner at CPK. We walked in to only a few tables that were occupied, yet the girl told us it would be a 15-20 minute wait. Whoa, there's tons of tables and there's only 3 of us, what gives? Well, they said they only had 3 servers for the night, so sitting us down wouldn't make sense, because it would take a server awhile to get to us. Hmm, interesting. Only 3 servers on a Friday night? Come on now. We were seated in about 15 minutes and our server was very prompt. We ordered a couple of drinks (really strong for my taste), and I ordered the caramelized peach salad, my sister ordered the margherita thin crust pizza, and my friend ordered the turkey club. Our food came out semi promptly, but the pizza my sister and I shared came out cold. Not warm, but  cold. The mozzarella didn't even have a chance to melt, so you could make out the small little circles of mozzarella on the dish. VERY disappointed, since this is one of my favorite pizzas.

Our server Brittany was fantastic, she courteously let me babble on about our horrible experience with food to you trying to get food from here about a month ago. She was just on top of everything. Just what I like when I go out. The food was above what I was expecting, I got the white pizza(could leave off the ricotta), lettuce wraps (OMG YUM) and my husband got the tortilla soup and fish tacos, which he enjoyed a lot. We even ordered more lettuce wraps to take home, the sauce was delish! One thing, as an old school server myself that drives me nuts, is if you are obviously looking around for someone and no one notices. I was looking around, just sorta looking, and the manager took note immediately, so I called him over just to say we had  had great food and service. I am happy.  The only thing I would change is the location. In our quote troubled economy unquote the mall was a ZOO (Are Americans THAT well trained to consume goods?) the parking lot was hell and impossible to maneuver. We had gone to Loehman's plaza, cause there used to be a CPK there, but it was gone.

This is our fourth review. Parking and Location: 3 stars. It is in the mall. That sums it up pretty well. Looks From Outside: 4 stars: Just the way a mall should look. Nice big windows, updated look, and clean. Looks From Inside: 4 stars It was very clean and comfortable. Very generic chain restaurant look. Wait Time: 4 stars. We were sat very quickly, didn't wait long for food. Customer Service: 2 stars: Customer service was good until our food got there and we had no silverware, plates, or napkins.  It took us a long time to get someone's attention as our food got cold. Menu: 3 stars: The menu is very speratic. A pizza restaurant that serves Chinese, Mexican, Italian, and even a Korean dish. The drink menu was good, a nice selection of beers. Price: 3 stars: The price was very average for the one size fits all pizza style. Although my daughter ordered a thin crust pizza and I a regular pepperoni, her pizza was twice the size of mine with the same amount of toppings for the same price. Food: 2 stars : The sauce was a little sweet and tomato paste tasting. The pepperoni was just ok not overly spicy. The sausage was nothing special. It was a very generic unimpressive pizza. It reminded me of defrosted pizza. Our beer was bad. We told the manager and she said checked and said we got the bottom of the keg.

Miika M.,"San Francisco, CA",2238,1693,2109,2.0,11/13/2006,"I agree with Cam. J/K!!! HAHA. Actually, since I had just ran an errand with my sister and we were starving for some casual fare, her boyfriend volunteered CPK.  And although my experiences here have been a hit/miss situations, I agreed, especially since B&N was next door. I could scoot over there right thereafter and look for the Gurskey collection of photographs. We were seated immediately and served ice teas, of which we promptly sent back to the kitchen.  First sip was okay, but as it slid down our throat, it left a nasty acrid bitterness.  We thought it could have been the batch, so with the second failed attempt, we sent it back.  Weird. Menu here is pretty extensive, with lots of pizzas (different combinations, such as the Kung Pao pizza or the Mango Tandoori Chicken) reflecting a fusion oriented cuisine.  My sister opted for their salad of tossed greens with pears, candied walnuts, and feta cheese.  I chose a cup of their Adobe Chicken soup while her boyfriend selected the Sedona Tortilla Soup.  The Adobe Chicken soup was pretty good, chunky with lots of corn, chicken and brown rice.  A thick creamy base with their sourdough bread would have been the perfect lunch meal. My Chicken Caesar Sandwich on Foccacia bread was not bad, but a little dry.  I was expecting more chicken meat and more dressing.  But it was still good.  My sis's boyfriend's pizza was a bit off (White Sauce Bacon pizza) in that there was a lot of smoky bacon flavor, but not enough cheese and I think it was mostly in part to the lack of spinach, since they elected to not carry spinach yet. In all, the meal was mediocre and it further cemented my sister's reason why she did not want to come here.  Pricey and food was not all that, but at least our server was on the ball.  Kudos and the good tip to her for keeping our food interests afloat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=220

Chris N.,"Sacramento, CA",215,440,120,3.0,7/7/2011,"My girlfriend and I dropped in for lunch one day while at the mall. There was plenty of open seating, but for some reason the host led us to the back of the restaurant and sat us between 3 tables filled with children. There were maybe 14 kids running around our table screaming while their parents ignored them. Why would the host think that the two of us wanted to sit amidst this anarchy?  I asked to be moved, to which the waiter seemed a little offended, as if we didn't want to sit in his section. The quieter part of the restaurant was much nicer, although the new waitress didn't seem to know we were in her section because we sat for another 20 minutes before getting to order. Overall, not the best dining experience.  But the food was good, just like at any other CPK. I'm a huge fan of the pear and gorgonzola pizza, which comes with an arugula salad on top of it (something that I don't understand, but it is delicious). That's really all I ever order these days, because I know it's a sure thing.

I 'd rather save the 15% I spent on a tip and get a pizza to go from somewhere and eat it in the comfort of my home. 2. The pizza's are small and only come in one size. The pizzas are cut into six slices and me and my girlfriend shared one and each of us had a salad. If I didn't have the salad I could have easily eaten one by myself.  3. The pizzas are expensive. I paid $13 for a six slice Chicken and Garlic pizza. My dollar could go way farther somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted fine.

The frozen pizzas don't emulate the taste of a fresh pizza from the restaurant... so if it's your first time, I suggest going to the restaurant!  We had avocado egg rolls and the thai chicken pizza. egg rolls - sooo good! they taste a bit reminiscent of chicken bakes from costco... with avocado in them.  thai chicken pizza - really really really strong taste. it was a crackin' party in my mouth, because there was so much going on. Good, nonetheless... but I like my pizza taste consistent and subtle. If you're a party animal, then I suggest this! CPK never upsets... until this night when my friend and I decided to lie about our birthday in order to get a free birthday sunday. Don't judge, you know you do it too. I went up to our waitress to ask if the restaurant did anything for birthdays... she proceeded to nod in a hospitable manner, as if it would be taken care of.

Chinese food on pizza? It was actually pretty good! I asked for whole wheat pizza crust to make the pizza somewhat healthier. The duck was scattered on top of the cheese. Hoisin sauce and strips of scallions topped the pizza. The sauce and the scallions gave the pizza the Asian flavor that I'm used to eating in Chinese food. My bf ordered the Wild Mushroom pizza. He loves mushrooms and couldn't resist order it. The pizza had three types of mushrooms and it was pretty good. Unfortunately, the flavors weren't as strong as the Asian pizza. Surprisingly we both finished our pizza. I got a little help from the bf. :) I have no idea why CPK gives each table bread. You figure that the pizza already has enough carbs in it.

Our server, Jessica, was pleasant, prompt, and very patient.  The hostess, whose name I can't remember (I remember she said she was Puerto Rican and Mexican, had dark curly hair and was very kind), was enthusiastic and polite. She was patient with my elderly grandmother, who takes awhile to walk to the table, and even spoke Spanish to her when she realized that might be easier for her (my grandma doesn't speak much English).

If it was cheaper, it'd be a four star but too pricy for me! $10+ dollars for a personal sized pizza, eh. But if you go here, I recommend the Jamaican Jerk. Deng, chicken and other vegetables, and a bit spicy. The other pizza I tried was the Mango Tandoori or something. It really taste like tandoori... was weird. Anyways I'm sure most CPKs taste the same, so review for chain restaurants are kind of dumb. I remember though at the end, nobody would take our bill for like 15 minutes so we sat there for a while.

Curtis W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,,4.0,2/20/2012,"I actually don't think of CPK as a pizza place, but I like it.  Been a fan for ten+ years.  We were regulars at the Walnut Creek store when we lived there, and have been to the Arden store numerous times since moving to Arden-Arcade seven years ago. Between my wife and me, we've probably tried everything on the menu.  Do I like everything? No.  But most of it is good, and I definitely have some favorite items. For me, the Sicilian pizza is comfort food.  All meat with some zip. Comfort for the wife is the mushroom pepperoni and sausage pizza (a.k.a the ""mupsa""). If you need a traditional kind of pizza, you can rely on either of the above. The roasted pear and gorgonzola pizza is one I am glad they brought back.  If you're a pizza purist that thinks pizza can only be tomato sauce, cheese, and meat, you just won't be happy.  They took this one off the menu for a while but people like me complained.  I don't order every time I come in, but I got it once in while.  A lot of others apparently felt the same way so they brought it back. The Thai chicken and BBQ chicken pizzas are also among my favorites and are probably original menu items.  And they have several good pasta dishes.  The kung pao spaghetti is really good (though I ask for it made with fettuccine), but it isn't Chinese food, OK? The service is consistently good.  I have panned service in places based on one or two visits, and it isn't like CPK has never had an off night.  But I have been here MANY... MANY... times, and would say that on average, they are spot on with great service.  We're regulars here for a reason. None of this is to say that I won't eat at a traditional pizza place.  In fact, there are plenty of times I prefer the family owned pizza parlor close-by in Carmichael.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=260

I probably never would have gone (chains always scare me--especially the kind found in airports), except that my elderly neighbor invited me to join her there for lunch. She's so sweet; I figured I'd give the place a try. We went to the location in Arden mall. Boy, have I been missing out! I was actually impressed! The menu was vast. I had a hard time deciding: salad or pizza? Maybe pasta? As the pizza devotee that I am, I opted for a pie. These choices were endless! I typically try the standard margarita pizza in new places, because you can really get a sense of the pizza that way. But it was lunch--I needed something light. Lots of veggies. The Greek pizza caught my eye--didn't sound much like pizza, actually, but yummy all the same. I asked the waiter for his opinion, and he agreed that it was tasty. I ordered. I loved my lunch! The Greek starts with a regular pizza crust, topped with melted mozzarella (no sauce). On top of that, they load diced cucumber, tomato, red onion, kalamata olive, and slices of avocado. Yum! The veggies were mixed with lots of fresh herbs, including chives and dill. This is then topped with homemade tzatziki sauce. (I heart tzatziki sauce!) They even provide extra so you can dip your crust. I'm not sure I can safely classify my meal as ""pizza,"" but I can classify it as yummy! Next time, I'll have to try the margarita and see how well it stands up--and I will certainly go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=260

Angee B.,"Sacramento, CA",1,11,1,1.0,10/17/2011,"I came to the Arden CPK with my husband and his cousins for dinner one night and I was greatly disappointed.  The way my family are, we are always joking around in a light mood.  It was around 7:30pm and there were about 4 tables being served including ours, so not a really busy night. When the waitress asked, what we would like to drink, one of us jokingly asked her, ""Yes, can I have some more gatorade, please? I'm out?""  The waitress from Michigan rolled her eyes and replied, ""Yeah, ok. Let me walk down to the gas station and get that for you"" and walked away.  We brushed it off as her attempt for sarcastic humor and decided on our order.  We started out with the chips and dip while we waited for our food.  The four of us were sharing a the $10 appetizer of chips.  My husband's cousin, sincerely asked, ""Are these chips bottomless?""  It was an honest and logical question seeing as many places do offer that.  The waitress looked at him like he was crazy and rolled her eyes and said, ""Um...no"" and just stared at him.  He then asked her, ""well, would it be ok if we get some more please?"" She walked away and reappeared a few minutes later with a small plate of chips and roughly dropped it on the table and walked off, not bothering to check to refill our drinks or asked how we are doing, whatsoever. After that blatant disrespectful service, I lost my appetite and was angry.  We called over the manager and explained the situation.  ""Michigan"" arrived with the food before he got there with all smiles and friendly attitude that we should have received from the get go.  A facade I knew she put on after the request from the manager that we asked of another waitress.   The manager came out and replied with, ""I'm sorry, I don't know why she's acting like that.  Her restaurant just closed down and she was transferred so I don't know her personality that well.""  As we continued to to explain that her attitude was not acceptable to guests, the manager then said, ""I'm sorry, she's usually not like this.  I don't know why she's acting this way.""  Really? I work in customer service and I understand bullshit.  First he said he doesn't know her, then he's saying she's not usually like this?  WTF? We told the manager that we understand if she might have had a bad day but it was her job to provide us with good, friendly, service and atmosphere.  If she can't handle that, she shouldn't be a server.  We were never rude to her and always requested items in a polite and respectful manner. I didn't eat the food because I was so disgusted with the waitresses attitude.  Her disrespectful and horrible service was enough for us to walk out.

I was hesitant the first time when my friend suggested that we should dine here instead of waiting for an hour for a spot in the Cheesecake factory. Yes, indeed a fantastic idea! All worth it!

I LOVE servers who gives me fantastic recommendation - they know best. 5 stars to service!  FOOD: So, here's what we got: (1) A MUST GET: Avocado Club Egg Rolls: 5 stars and beyond!! Love this! Chicken with avocado (now, you know it's awesome), tomatoes, cheese and bits of bacon, all wrapped in this CRUNCHY, CRUNCHY wrap- looks like it's been deep fried. Dip it in a tangy ranch sauce... oh man...now, I'm in heaven! (2) Roasted Artichoke and Spinach Pizza: My favorite thin crust pizza! It's hard to bite. The artichokes and spinach falls off with every bite, so I'll take a full bite when there's artichokes. There's bits of chicken, cheesy cheese! 4 stars. (3) Asparagus and Spinach Spaghetti: 4 stars! Asparagus, spinach, tomatoes, basil, cheese and chicken mixed in a stir-fried-like - because it seemed to oily, but so good tho! Ah! 4 stars! DRINKS: Server gave us some recommendation on wines - I liked it, not fancy wine and you can probably buy it in safeway. So, craving wine! **OVERALL: Can't go wrong with avocado!

Taryn M.,"Ventura, CA",2,11,1,1.0,10/21/2013,"I have been to several California Pizza Kitchens over the last 15+ years since I was a teenager.  I have always looked forward to the delicious food, quality service and innovative menu. This is by far the worst CPK I have ever been to in my life and am appalled that after I contacted them, I have yet to hear back from the store.  We had a take out order of a grilled vegetable sandwich on herb onion focaccia bread with a side caesar and the crispy mac and cheese bites.  We placed this order a full 40 minutes before arriving as it was lunch time and we figured they might be busy. Upon arriving, our side salad was not ready and had to wait another 7 minutes for it.  They also had no bread and after waiting 4 more minutes, we just took our bag and left as we had a state conference at the double tree across the street.   Upon opening our items, the sandwich was on the wrong bread, the caesar barely filled 1/4 of the container, and there was no sauce with the mac and cheese bites.  While we were starving and had a full 5 more hours of our conference we began eating only to find A HAIR in our sandwich!? I can only presume it is this location as the CPK's in LA, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties have always been spot-on. I would definitely pick the Cheesecake Factory next time I come to this area.  What a disappointment.  And to still not be called back after relaying my dissatisfaction is beyond poor customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=140

I liked the original crust a bit more thin the skinny one, which was a tad too skinny. The California Club was the winner out of the two. It had hunks of bacon, lettuce drenched in mayo, tomato, chicken and huge slabs of avocado. The Jerk Chicken one had good flavor, but wasn't too impressive.

They pretty much only carry top shelf, so pricing is premium! Their cocktail list is girly, in general, but there are some good options - again, if you don't mind forking over your arm or leg. For this being an establishment in my top 5, this is lacking a star due to customer service. Turnover is high - so quality of employees isn't always on par.

I've been on a Pizza craze lately trying pizza from everywhere. My Pizza was the California Club pizza, I felt like I was eating a salad on top of my pizza. It had fresh arugula, mozzarella and avocado slices on top of a cooked pizza with melted cheese and crispy bacon. All my fresh toppings kept sliding off. We also ordered a full sized Moroccan spicy chicken salad. Ehhh...... It was okay, I didn't like the dressing, the squash cubes and beet cubes were refreshing, chicken flavor was okay. MY server was really nice, the only good thing. My typical restaurant chain....never disappoints me too much because this is what I expect, mediocre food from a chain restaurant, especially being a part of the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=80

The restaurant is very open and inviting with a lot of light and decorative accents. Oh, and the food is delish! It was crowded for lunch, but not too crowded to where there was a wait, so the place had a nice energy. Our server was attentive and sweet, she may have been new because she didn't know what a Chimay was and seemed a little nervous around our large group, but her service level didn't suffer. Every time I come to California Pizza Kitchen (which is a lot!) I always know what to expect which is great! The food is extremely consistent (Yay no surprises!) and the service is always good. We ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Spring Rolls for the table which everyone seemed to love (both had meat in them) and I ordered the Margherita Pizza which was amazing!! It had the perfect mix of olive oil, basil and cheese and when I added red pepper flakes it was perfect! Nice thin crispy crust too. Their pizzas are big enough for two people to share with an appetizer, or for one person to eat and have plenty for leftovers! I also had a glass of their Berry Sangria which was so great! Sangria for me can be hit or miss, so I tried this one based on a recommendation from a coworker. It came in a huge glass and was so good and refreshing! Definitely recommended if you like or even kind of like sangria. I would definitely come back here for lunch when I have a little more time, or if I am hungry at the mall and want a nice meal or snack!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=80

D E.,"Sacramento, CA",1,5,,1.0,7/30/2016,"I had a horrible experience this evening with CPK on Arden.  After a difficult day -- a car accident that left me laid up, I decided to order CPK for delivery through a 3rd party delivery service.  The delivery service's job is to pick up the order and deliver it, that's it.   When I ordered, however, on a system that send the information to CPK, along with notes, I ordered 2 salads and specifically added ""please don't forget the dressing.""  This note was made because this particular restaurant is notorious for leaving something out of to go orders.  Well, the delivery was made and, no dressing. I called the delivery service who was quite obnoxious about it (so I won't be using Food to You anymore), but did offer pick up my dressings.  Well 2.5 hours later, no dressing. I got in the car and drove over.  I called on the way to ask if they could have two dressings ready.  The young woman on the phone (the hostess I learned when I arrived) was very sweet and very helpful and apologized for the missing dressings.  So, when I arrived, I was quite surprised when the Manager decided to question ... a woman who ordered a delivery, because she had an accident and was laid up, who drove over 7 miles to retrieve dressing for those salads ... really?  She insisted I must have received the salad dressing because she personally had been helping with the take-out orders. Again, who lies about receiving salad dressing on a delivery order simply to drive over for 2 1/4 cup size dressings? When I questioned why she was questioning me, she said she wasn't (although when she left the man waiting next to me confirmed for me how rude she was to me!).  When she returned with 2 dressings she shoved them at me and barked ""I'm sorry.""  I could have just taken the dressing and left ... but she was so rude I asked if I could speak to the manager.  Well, it turned out SHE IS THE MANAGER!  Wow.  I work for a very large organization that serves customers (members actually) and if any one of my staff treated them the way she treated me, they'd have some pretty serious explaining to do. I've registered my complaint with CPK Corporate Offices as well. I won't be going back to CPK again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=80

One thing that I hate at restaurants is being served bread that isn't warm or hot or fresh out of the oven.  This place is known for their oven-baked pizzas, so I would assume a loaf of their starter bread would be nice and hot, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle.  This bread was COLD!  Fresh out-of-the-fridge cold!  So you know when you put a freshly baked loaf of bread in the fridge, it becomes hard and chewy and COLD!  Why would anybody serve that, and with some hard ass, cold butter to boot?!!!  We even asked our server if the bread was supposed to be cold.  She said yes.  That's ridiculous!  Seriously, CPK chefs/management...bread is not supposed to be served cold!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=80

The biggest surprise was the sunny side up egg, potato, and bacon pizza.  The pizza bread was slightly thinner crusted than anticipated, but the egg and bacon on pizza was pleasantly surprising!  The potato was baked so tasted like chips.  It would be nice if there was an option to have additional eggs added onto the pizza because 2 doesn't seem like enough. Kids menu items were quite generous!  Fusilli and Alfredo was more than enough for my 5 year old.  The personal pizzas were more than enough for my older two.  Of course the pepperoni caused some greasiness, but it wasn't excessive.

We thought to come here and sit for a change! Long story short, the first part of the experience wasn't that good as we waited for so long! Ashley showed up soon after I told the guy on the counter. She, politely and genuinely apologized which made us feel much better :). She then offered us an appetizer for free to make it up for us, so far so good!.  We ordered our favorite pizzas: Margarita pizza ( + tomatoes and extra basil) and the BBQ chicken pizza. We also ordered the free appetizer, some pasta. By the way, I love the bread with the olive oil they serve for free.  We were so happy with the quality and the taste of our food, we enjoyed it. Ashley kept on checking on us making sure we are happy and enjoying our meal and time. We even chatted a little bit about our families and personal lives.  Once we were done, Ashley put the leftovers in boxes, thanked us, wished us a good night and then left. I was confused on where I should pay, i thought they will bring me the check!!! So I went and asked Ashley, here manager Loren was there and she said: ""I got this, you waited so long (it wasn't that long actually) so i got this :) don't worry about it"" and I was speechless, didn't know what to say.  It was, by far, the most amazing experience I had here in Sacramento, not because of the free food and the amazing service I received, but because they were sensitive and sincerely felt sorry for letting us wait. Loren and Ashley were sincere, polite, amazing and full of surprises. I would've been so happy with the free appetizer but no, they went beyond what was expected and made our night unforgettable .. this is what i call Delivering Happiness not just amazing food :).

I also ordered the Jambalaya, the pasta was good yet the sausages tasted like the frozen ones that you heat up. the shrimps and crawfish were overcooked and had a rubbery consistancy. after i ate halfway through the pasta the dish was lathered in the oil left behind, i could litterally collect all the left over oil and deep fry some chicken. but the food wasnt the only thing leaving a bad taste in my mouth the service was HORRENDOUS. i walked in and noticed that there were about 10 to 12 workers, they actually outnumbered the patrons present. yet with 10+ workers no one offered me a table or even gave me a greeting until about 6 minutes of standing in front of the front desk. our waitress seated us and asked if we wanted drinks, that would be the last time she asked us about our drinks, she didnt even try to refill our glasses until we called for her after searching around the room for 8 minutes. she did not serve us bread either we had to ask another server because you guessed it our waitress was no where in sight. our pizza came quick, but the pasta didnt come until we had finished our pizza, i noticed a plate sitting on the ocunter for about 15 minutes and when our waitress finally came out of the back BINGO we were the winners that was our plate! horray! our waitress walked by and and as she cleared the plates she gave us a pity ""how was the food"" in a arrogant nonchalant voice that screamed she was not paying attention to our answer, we could have said this was the worst pizza ever, and she would have still responded thats wonderfull. the place was very unporfessional i saw one of the cooks picking something off of one of the pastas and pizza and eating it before it would be served. while other waitors were giving the food to the wrong tables all around it was complete chaos. i would recomend others to try CPK but advise them to go to any CPK OTHER THAN THE ARDEN LOCATION STAY AWAY! i wont be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=300

Want a salad? Try Jack's Urban Eats Want a pizza? Try Luigis, Wenellis, or Chicago Fire Want pasta? Try Espanol on Folsom Blvd CPK has one thing going for it and that is, it is consistent. The Arden CPK is better than most other CPK's in that we use a wood fire oven for or pizzas where as most other ones use gas, which really kill the thin crust pizzas. However, we're overpriced by a long shot and alot of the chicken we use is already cooked and is thawed out before serving. We're not unique in this as Elephant Bar, Cheesecake Factory, Applebees, Mimi's, etc all tend to do this. The serving staff is a mix of pro's and those who shouldn't be in the business at all, but thats like most places. They are also changing the decor of the place so hopefully it will start to look up to standard as we were rocking that In-N-Out look for far too long. Also, there is a Roseville store already open and a new in Downtown going in. I will warn you about new chain stores, they take awhile for the kinks to be worked out so don't expect your socks to be blown off. I avoid new chains like the plague.

aaron n.,"Sacramento, CA",83,150,6,4.0,6/7/2008,"this place always seems to be packed and busy no matter what time of the day or week. cpk is a consistent place to go to get interesting pizza and a variety of other foods as well. whats cool about cpk is that they have  something for everyone. the last time i was here we came for one of our cousins bdays. so my pizza became a cornucopia of like 6 other pizzas haha. my personal favorites are still the thai, bbq, chipotle, jamaician jerk.  the various rolls and spinach dip are all good starters as well. the only thing i really don't like it when i am here is usually whomever controls the television watches CNN for some reason, the bartender or whomever makes the drinks are skimpy on the alcohol and sometimes seating is a little to in proximity to other people, so conversations are like at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=300
Love E.,"Sacramento, CA",6,1,3,2.0,10/27/2010,"We were there last nite to celebrate the birthdays of two children aged 5 and 3. Our experience was disappointing. The only time the waitress smiled was while presenting the check. She was cold during the entire time. We ordered 3 cocktails, an appetizer, three entrees and a kids meal. The appetizer was just about average. The Chipotle Pizza was great, The Tequila Lime Pasta and the Veggie Pasta were great too.  We asked for extra plates and the waitress looked at us as though we asked her for something out of the ordinary. The cocktails were watered down. We brought our own icecream cake. We asked for plates to serve the cake. The plates provided to us were dirty. One of the plates had a lot of coffee stains in it. I have had better experiences at ths same location during lunch time. Cheese cake factory would have been a better option. The check came to $74 and we still added a 10% tip eventhough the waitress did not deserve any.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=300
