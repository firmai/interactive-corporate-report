175,Olivia Z.,"Dana Point, CA",0,21,36.0,3.0,2016-10-21,"They were quite slow today. Not sure why considering there were so many people working. Getting drinks took about 15 minutes. Picking up the check, just as much time. The food was really good though and the beer was delicious. We had the flat breads and they were all delicious. The nacho flatbread was really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=140,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
98,Maria D.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,1,,1.0,2016-10-22,"Just dine in and was totally frustrated with my first visit. I ordered the parmesan chicken with white mashed potatoes and brocolli, very salty though i squeezed the lemon all over the chicken. The mashed potatoes seems like instant in a box and the brocolli, part raw. The strawberry lemonade is just like puree that i need to add water just to finish it. Then i asked for table napkins 3 times, first 2 service crew haven't come back and on third time, comes back with 2 small brown pieces of napkins that they use as coasters. The service crew asked how are we doing, and i said the food is salty, i dont even ate half on the plate, and she goes' oh, im sorry, do you need a container to go?'. The heck! I will not recommend this place. Paid too much with unsatisfying experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=120,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003
37,Jade T.,"Bergen County, NJ",218,129,380.0,4.0,2016-10-23,"Ahhhh so happy this place opened up! My boyfriend and I were shopping at Walmart when we noticed it. We decided to stop in for ""a"" beer because we had low expectations. We liked it so much we ended up stay for nearly two hours! They had a huge selection of beers on tap. Best of all, they have a bunch of their own custom brews. I loved them! My favorites were the Jeremiah Red, Brewhouse Blonde, and their Harvest beer (forget the full name).  We had just eaten dinner before stopping in so didn't end up trying food, but definitely plan to next time.  Luckily we managed to get a seat at the bar, but if we didn't, we probably would have left after one drink. There's a very small space between the bar and bar tables, which makes it practically impossible to stand comfortably while you wait for a seat to open up. My only complaint is that the floors are SO slippery..... I seriously almost killed myself walking around. My boyfriend said the same happened to him! I ended up bringing it up to the staff and they said that they have issues with the type of floors at all their locations. They need to take action on this asap because someone is going to seriously injure themselves.  Either way, I definitely recommend BJ's for some drinks, especially their custom brews. Just walk cautiously ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=20,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003
64,Sara K.,"Parsippany, NJ",214,11,103.0,4.0,2016-10-23,"This was my first time at this restaurant all together, and I was pleased with everything. The wait was about 25-30 minutes on a Sunday night around 5:45. There were many people waiting and management made an awesome judgment call to have one of the servers go around to the people waiting with free samples of their pizza! Really good call whether it's a brand new spot or an ancient mom and pop shop. I had the Bloody Mary which was okay. It's a premise mix so nothing amazingly flavorful. Then, as an appetizer we decided to get a mini pizza instead of the standard apps. Since it's not a standard app, our entrees actually came out first without the pizza app coming out at all. Management came over and apologized but it wasn't a big deal. For a new quality place, that's a minor glitch.  I had the jambalaya and it was delicious and had a good kick as it should. My boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs and that was pretty good also considering it's not a specialty Italian place.  For dessert we did the trio pizookies. The cookies and cream and white chocolate macadamia were really good.  Overall, loved it and definitely plan on coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=60,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003

The brisket was cold and so was the bun. The fries are really bland. I had the shrimp and asparagus pasta. The pasta was undercooked and the shrimp and the asparagus tasted like freezer. It's a brewhouse, so I think people should probably stick to pub style food like wings and burgers.

172,Patricia K.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",1,5,14.0,5.0,2016-10-30,"This place is amazing ! From the service to the beer selection to the food you couldn't ask for more. And not to mention you must save room for dessert because it's that good!! Even when it seems over whelming because there's so many options on the food and drink menu , you just let the server know what you normally drink and they give you samples Of their beer that are similar yet so much better! and when you know what your in the mood for food wise they basically help you narrow down the options. My boyfriend and I got the chicken pot stickers and calamari as an app , and then a mini pizza ( deep dish bjs favorite ) , and ribs and ahi tuna salad as an entree and we loved everything.  They also have a special going on for October for breast cancer awareness month , select drinks proceeds go to the the foundation , the manager maxwell checked on us and we let him know how delightful everything was. Our server Shannon did an awesome job and they've only been open a week and a half . 5 stars from us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=140,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007
35,Christine G.,"Englewood, NJ",498,396,609.0,3.0,2016-10-30,I came with low expectations since they are new and a chain but delightfully surprised. Some servers were clearly better than others but I'm sure with more training all the kinks will be ironed out. Walked in around 4pm on a Sat with no wait but as we were leaving a line was starting to form. I can see this place being swarmed with sports fans since TVs are everywhere both bar and restaurant side. The flight of beers is a good value for 4 5 oz pours at $7.95 and you get to try a variety of their beers. This was perfect for us first timers. Their beers were good. Light and tasty but some lacked that umph. I did like that they carried other beers from NJ on their draft list. Their avocado egg rolls and ahi poke were good and I would order them again but the deep dish pizza not so much. Wings with the sriarcha dry rub were yum and maybe next time I can ask for them to be a little more crispy. Pizzokies with ice cream were such an indulgence and on the sweeter side. They have a $10 off $35 coupon on their website until Nov so definitely try them out and use it. Will be back for HH and post-Costco runs!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=20,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005
176,James S.,"Teaneck, NJ",0,10,,5.0,2016-10-31,"This place is on fire! Definitely coming back. First of all the environment is very hip and and cozy. You get this strange mixed sensation of feeling welcome and good time, I don't know what it was but it made me and my friend feel cool/good. I got these seafood tacos (grilled), one mahi-mahi, one shrimp. Real tasty, especially the shrimp one. I got a basic mixed drink but my friend got a beer they had with pumpkin flavor and a cinnamon sugar rim. He loved it. The staff is friendly and attentive. We were taken care of by a smart sweet girl whose name I believe was Heather. Anyway, I liked it, it's a good place for business reunions, dates, family nights, friends get together, anything really. Kind of like a better version of applebees but they charge around the same maybe a bit more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=140,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007
62,Tiffany Y.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",117,168,310.0,3.0,2016-10-31,"This place looks big on the outside but it wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be. I expected this to be two levels (not sure why..) but it was on main level with high ceilings. I came with some friends on a Sunday night to watch the football game and thought it was going to be packed. Luckily, the place was quiet (probably because it was raining) and we got seated in front of a TV... The decor of this place is nice...sort of like a high end bar. The bar is to the far left of the restaurant housing an array of beers and wines. To the middle and the right of the restaurant seats tables and booths with TV's all around which is definitely a plus for sports fans. The place is very clean and the staff was extremely friendly. I would watch yourself walking at the front of the restaurant. If your shoes are wet or if there's not real good traction on your shoes, you tend to fall or slip on the type of tile they have up front. I read a review prior to going and they said the same thing, so I definitely prepared myself since my shoes were wet from the rain. I could easily see how some people can slip on the tiles.  The food options offer pages and pages of selection. I'm not too overly fond of the menu...it reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory where there's SO many choices that you get overwhelmed by the restaurant. Our waiter came over and explained the menu to us in the fastest way possible, confusing us even more. It was mentioned that only SOME appetizers were half off during football season and how some appetizers weren't. The beers were also explained the same. Seeing so many options from burgers to pizza to deep dish pizza to shrimp tacos to wings to steak to fish, I couldn't continue to look at the menu anymore without being overly indecisive. I opted for the gluten free pizza, whiles my friends got a deep dish, a bison burger, and a French dip sandwich. The food portions are large and definitely enough for leftovers to bring home. My gluten free pizza was delicious, but a little bit too oily. My friend ordered a mini sized deep dish pizza (they come in 4 different sizes) which consists of 4 small slices of pizza. Since the pizza she got was loaded with chicken and other stuff, she was overly stuffed with the mini sized. The bison burger was thin with thick buns, topped with onions and green chili (which you can ask to not get). The food was surprisingly good since I went in there with low expectations.  The staff was also extremely friendly. Our waiter was super chill and made sure we got everything we needed. He apologized when he didn't bring us a second order of a mini deep dish and charged us for it. When the  bill and we went over everything, we told him we never got the second deep dish pizza and he apologized a million times and got their manager involved to apologize as well. It wasn't a big deal for us since everyone was already so full, but it was an appreciated gesture that the manager acknowledge the mistake and apologized.  Overall I  think this place is reasonably priced with a great selection of alcohol.  Truthfully, I'm turned off by the selection on the menu because there was so much going on. I also wasn't too happy about the tiles in front of the restaurant because it could cause problems if someone falls. I don't think this is a place I would go to ALL the time but I would come back again to try the rest of the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=60,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

157,Carol S.,"Clifton, NJ",0,3,,5.0,2016-11-04,"We walked in today expecting something like an average chain restaurant experience like applebees or chilis but walked out with an amazing experience. Walking in the place was crowded, there was a 30 minute wait, which we expected since it was a Friday night. We got seated and right away our server Anna came to greet us. Since we haven't ever been to BJ's she recommended some of their beers that they brew and they were very tasty and unlike many others. She managed to give me a sample of probably my favorite beer that I ever had(Jeremiah red) we were very pleased with her recommendations from the beginning, we did try her appetizer that she recommended (stuffed spinach mushrooms) and they were great. Anna was always there to refill our drinks and always took care of anything we needed, her recommendations were excellent and I would definitely come to eat here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=160,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004,2.9640000000000004
87,Santo A.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",31,18,5.0,1.0,2016-11-05,"I have been to this place twice since it recently opened. Once for lunch and then about two weeks later for dinner.   LUNCH: My wife and I met there for lunch two days after the grand opening. She ordered the Mediterranean chicken pita taco which lacked the main ingredient (chicken). When she asked the waitress jokingly ""where's the chicken"", her answer was all of the portions are pre-measured. Really?? I ordered the Roast beef dip where the au-jus sauce tasted and smelled like motor oil. Not appetizing to say the least. Ok, I get it.  Second day opened for business and they're still working out the kinks.  The wait staff was very attentive but were insistent about pushing the beer and having us sign up and download the restaurant's app, which I now regret. (I'll explain in a few) DINNER: Two weeks later we were shopping in the area and decided to go there for dinner and to give this place another try,  hoping they worked out most of their issues.  My wife ordered the bacon guacamole cheese burger which was prepared perfectly to her liking. No complaints there.  On  the other hand I wasn't so lucky. I was trying to eat healthy so I ordered the Chicken Barbacoa dish which comes with brown rice and black beans.  They brought out my dish which looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Barbacoa ??  I got a 3oz piece of grilled chicken (pre-measured portions) remember?, smothered In ice cold salsa right out of the refrigerator. Really disgusting. No effort what so ever put into making that dish. I showed my waitress and she agreed we and sent it back. I had to re-order something so I went with the chicken wing appetizer with no sauce or rub, just plain wings. I knew they couldn't mess that up. The waitress was awesome and took good care of us, knowing herself; that the food pretty much sucked.  THE CHECK: Now It's time to try out the new BJ's app and pay the check through my iPhone, cool right? Having put all my information into the app previously, this should have been no problem.  I decided to give my waitress a 25% tip who did an exceptional job.  Once the check cleared through the app on my phone I noticed that I was overcharged by about $7. The manager then came to my table and regrettably explained that the bill already went thru electronically and there was nothing he could do except offer us a Pizookie (dessert cookie) the next time we visit. Just ask for him. WTF!! I asked why couldn't he just cancel the check out, but he said it already went thru. I then suggested he just go into the register and pull out $7 and give it to me. He couldn't do that either.  It's not about the $7. I was generous enough to give the waitress a nice tip. It's the point that I don't believe the manager used all his resources to address this issue.  He must have figured it's only $7, but he is truly mistaken. It's a lot more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=120,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468

Great acoustics, lots of wall mounted tvs with sports and news. Started with the avocado eggrolls. Now, I'm not a fan of the fruit, but these were very good! Crispy, abundantly filled, and the spicy dipping sauce was awesome. I had the jambalaya. Loads of chicken, sausage, and shrimp, and I like spicy, but it was wayyy too spicy to finish..evident by the sweat pouring over my brow.  The dessert was very good. A sort of salted caramel tart that was crisp on the edges, with a large serving of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on top.

When we were seated the hostess made light conversation and asked if it was our first time here and explained the menu, the beer, and told us to save room for dessert cause the pizookies are a must try (she wasn't kidding!!) Our waiter and his trainee were very nice and accommodating. My friend I ordered two tasters and tried almost every beer they had. The tasters are very generous 5oz pours. I highly recommend a taster it's a great portion and you get to try a bunch of beers. The food was all really good and fairly priced. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Pizookie.

147,Michael E.,"West Orange, NJ",1,30,10.0,2.0,2016-11-12,"I usually wait until my experience with a restaurant is complete before reviewing it, but in this case, unfortunately, I have time to kill. It's been 45 minutes and I'm still waiting for the one thing I ordered, an appetizer, to be served. The waiter has never returned. The assistant manager who promised to correct everything also never returned or corrected anything. In my frustration, I started to leave and on my way out the door, the general manager asked what the problem was, and convinced me to sit down and try again. Now I'm waiting once more. I like BJ's, but this admittedly new location has a long, long way to go before being a place I'd recommend. Perhaps after they've had some time to iron out the kinks I'll come back and try again, but not for a while. There seems to be a tremendous amount of chaos and confusion among the staff, and this was at 3pm. I can't imagine what it would be like at the height of the lunch or dinner rush. In the spirit of full disclosure, the food did eventually come, and it was perfectly decent, and they didn't charge me for it, which I appreciated, but I'd rather pay full price than go through this hassle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=160,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
99,Shelley R.,"Paramus, NJ",1,9,5.0,2.0,2016-11-12,"Quite disappointed last night at BJ's. First off- a place that calls itself a ""brew house"" should have more than 12 seats at the bar! It was literally impossible to order a drink and if you are actually able to, there is no place to stand and hang out to enjoy it as the tables nearby back right up to the bar stools. We waited over an hour for a table- no place to sit at all while we waited -standing room only in the crowded entry area. Food was average quality but more pricey than we expected. The saving grace of the evening was our waitress but that was about it.

45,Andrew L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",42,107,134.0,3.0,2016-11-13,"We came in for a weekend lunch about 3 weeks after they opened. The space was surprisingly small, considering the size of the building. Still, our party of 3 didn't have to wait to be seated. At first, I was amazed at the thickness of the menu. There seemed to be a lot of choices but unfortunately nothing pops out at you. Even though there's a lot of variety, there isn't anything extra creative about their food. And for what you get, the price is just a tad too high. Service was good and we were checked on a regular basis. Where we were seated, the booths were a little too close to the high seated tables so getting up to go to the bathroom (which is very nice) was a bit of a hassle. I ordered the baked ziti which was tasty but nothing to rave about. Across from me, my friend's clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl looked alright. He said the soup was good but for what he was paying, it wasn't enough. I decided to finish with their signature pizookie, their take on the Uno's deep dish cookie sundae (which Applebee's has a variation of now as well). The cookie was too chewy on the bottom and edges, and was also a little dry. That made it feel like there wasn't enough ice cream. The server said it was my fault that I didn't like it.

I recommend for a spot to meet friends and grab a beer, or enjoy some family time.  It can get a little loud, so I wouldn't recommend serious convos...just sayin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=80,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997
158,Joe S.,"Manahawkin, NJ",2,3,5.0,2.0,2016-11-20,"My girlfriend and I went out with another couple for dinner a few weeks after their opening and we were not impressed at all. The food is mediocre, and way over priced, in my opinion. We had ordered 2 appetizers, 4 meals, and a couple of beers/mixed drinks each. The apps (boneless wings and potstickers) seemed to be fresh out of the microwave and on to the plate. The drinks were fine, but you can't really mess those up. Now my meal (jambalaya) wasn't bad, very spicy, but I enjoyed it. The other 3 meals were not so good (3 ribeye steaks) which were flavorless, over-cooked, tough and just boring. They come with a choice of 2 sides and soup or salad as well, which weren't anything to talk about. Once the check came we were all surprised by the total which was $215! For that price we could've gone to Segovias in Little Ferry, or La Cambusa in Garfield and spent around the same for way better quality food.  All in all, I would not come back here, too over priced for the low quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=160,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472
180,Robert A.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",19,114,5.0,3.0,2016-11-24,I have visited the new location in Teterboro twice now. The first visit everything was great and I had high praise for them.  I just made a second visit and it seems someone in the kitchen has developed a very heavy hand with the salt.  I can say this for certain because I ordered the exact same food as on my first visit and the salt was so bad I had to send one of the meals back with specific orders that NO salt be used.  It came back better (at to an edible level) but was still on the salty side.   I hope they can fix this problem soon as I will only go back for one more try and I really like the food when thyey go easy on the salt.  They also screwed up the bill. The printed version of the bill was delivered to the table and I then used the mobile pay on their app so I could apply my points to lower the bill.  I had a copy sent to my home email and when I looked at it they charged me twice for the dish I sent back.  They should have comped it but instead they chargeds me twice. I sent them an email to get it corrected and will have to wait and see.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=180,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

The service was great from our waitress down to the bus boys taking our empty plates. Everyone had a smile on their face and was very polite and willing to help. Even had another waitress refill our drinks. Very professional staff. The food was amazing. Everything was served hot and seemed very fresh. We ordered an appetizer it was spaced out well from our entrees. Decent sized servings also for a good price. Not over priced at all.

31,Michael E.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",284,252,497.0,3.0,2016-11-29,"This is a new restaurant in a fairly new shopping center. We were in this area about a month ago and wanted to eat here but it was still being constructed so we settled for a nearby burger joint, but don't get me wrong the burger place was really good. ""Habit Burger"". So while in the area for a work project we saw that BJ Brew House was open for business. This is a chain restaurant where you're greeted at the hostess station and led to a table.  First.. the restaurant name. Never mind. This is a large restaurant with a bar area, booths and tables. Based on the size of the restaurant it didn't seem too busy and there was plenty of help, but it took quite awhile before we were waited on. In fact I was getting ready to leave when our waitress Tabitha showed up. Just a note, they don't serve coke, only Pepsi.  For me strike 1. I had the burger with bacon and brisket. Out of this world. I could eat that every day for lunch if I could. But the let down was the fries that came with it. Fries if you want to call them that. Mine were just pieces of fries, maybe 1/2 inch each. Big disappointment. Ketchup bottle was empty too. My business partner had a standard burger, what else, and said it was good but I noticed he didn't finish the burger or fries. Seemed like he was more interested in checking out Tabitha.

60,Damian S.,"Dumont, NJ",188,252,272.0,3.0,2016-11-29,"Nice beer selection. They have roughly 10 house beers (amongst a sea of other beers on tap) and 4 house made sodas. I tried their IPA and Root Beer (non alcoholic). The IPA was pretty tasty, not the best I've ever had but certainly not bad (a nice drinkable not overly hoppy everbody kinda IPA). The Root Beer was really yummy! They offer growler fills here and I considered getting a growler of the (of all things) Root Beer (I know I was shocked too folks).  To eat I ordered the Fried Jalapeño Burger. The fries were actually quite good. Seasoning is subjective and I thought the fries were close to being perfect but maybe a bit too salty. The burger, while under cooked to what I asked, was delicious. I used to order medium rare but there were many instances where I would get just rare burgers I switched to medium. In switching to medium I had hoped to get something closer to medium rare. What I've found, now, is most places cook up so I'm stuck with medium well burgers. There are two exceptions Zinburger (see my Clifton review) and, now, BJ's. There is a Chipotle Mayo sauce on it which was drizzled and I wish I could have tasted it better. The fried jalapeños were good but I wish they were a bit spicier.  I left BJ's a fan. The three stars is rough as I think it should be closer to four but I'm weighing heavy on the fry seasoning (too salty) and (while in my favor) cooking temperature. I'm 97% sure if anyone (other than me) ordered the medium burger I recieved it would be sent back as under cooked (the burger I received was medium rare and I loved ever minute of it ).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=60,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.54,3.5200000000000005

116,Steve H.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",7,15,3.0,2.0,2016-12-04,"We ate there when it first opened, food was surprisingly good, soups and wings espedially. Their draft craft beers were just ok but the are other local craft taps make up for any real craft beer fan's taste buds. I decided to try it again on Saturday, this time Take Out. Their website advertises curbside take out, I'm not sure exactly what that is supposed to mean, maybe one didnt get out of the car and the food is delivered to you in a preset parking space, but I went inside to pick up my order, having not see any signs or directions about this.  We had ordered through their app. Seems there is a big push by BJs to download their app and get points to be redeemed later. The cashier seemed confused when we walked in, taking a lot of time trying to figure out the app and our order and may not have been working on the job long. She wanted to know was I redeeming points, which I had not even asked about or wanted. A manager stepped in and gave us some sort of an ice cream and cookie package, which we didn't order but accepted. The manager claimed it was because we downloaded their app and it was complimentary. It wasn't until we got to our destination did we realize everything wasn't ok. So check everything before you leave. I'm not sure what the problem is over there in Take Out but when one orders a French dip and you don't include the French dip, then it's just a roast beef sandwich. Stop worrying about handing out free stuff and work on your customer service and getting your orders correct. No French dip was the first disappointment, then to find out no napkins or utensils in a take out order, which included soup and their free ice cream really stood out to say they still don't have their act together in their Take Out area. Food was ok. I would put them on par with a Chili's with a better craft beer menu. But the Take Out service is unacceptable. BJ'S has been opened about a month now here, so they should have worked out the kinks.

27,Jill P.,"Paramus, NJ",635,174,1165.0,1.0,2016-12-10,"After looking forward to checking out this new spot, we were completely let down from their food. We left feeling sick and disgusted. Don't be misled like we were by their nice interior and pictures on the menu. Their boneless wings were either undercooked or so over processed, the meat was a weird translucent clear. After getting a second order because we thought they weren't cooked, I figured out its probably over processed chicken because it didn't even have a normal texture.  The chicken club sandwich is covered and dripping in garlic butter, the chicken breast again questionable and included dark meat, and my bacon was deep fried. After 3 bites I was done, no question if the food was ok after the waitress saw I wasn't eating it. At this point I didn't want anything else anyway. The Alfredo chicken pasta was not as bad, but the chicken didn't look real. This went in the garbage too. If you want a Moscow mule, you have to buy the entire bottle of beer, but you only need half for the drink, then they charge you for the vodka. So if you only want one, its $12 and its not even good because they use concentrate lime juice. It's supposed to be fresh limes. Then your left with half a ginger beer and a bad drink. The cookie pizza wasn't bad, except it was completely raw in the middle. Like straight cookie batter as in liquid, not slightly cooked. If it was cooked, it would have been really good. Came home and felt completely awful. Even the next day, terrible. Will never go back here. The manager checked on other tables but skipped ours otherwise I would have said something. Complete waste of $60, wish I could get that back and not have wasted the calories.

We actually saw a few people leave. Secondly,the staff is untrained in the sense that they don't have a sense of seating arrangement and don't know the actual wait times and give out wrong information to customers. I saw people in groups of two or three sitting in a booth for 6. We actually got our table well before 1.5 hours. Coming to service,i think they are very understaffed or undertrained.the waitress had to be reminded again and again for the drinks.she gave the reason that bar was backed up whereas it was Monday night 9:30 pm and it was half empty. She did not even put up the cutleries before the food showed up.we had to ask twice.she didn't ring in a few items.not even the mini birthday pizzokie my wife ordered for me. Totally sub par service. The food was just average.we ordered same pizza twice and it was different in taste.the waiter didn't knew how to handle the heavy cast iron pan. Pizzokie was the only thing good about this night.

149,Dyann C.,"Belleville, NJ",87,5,17.0,1.0,2016-12-21,"So here is our review... first of all we were there 2 Hours and 21 minutes for 4 people to have dinner on Wednesday night. Way too long for me. It took them 20 minutes to come over and ask if we wanted something to drink. Took forever for all the food to come out. Took another 6 minutes for them to bring our check, we waited 15 minutes for them to come so we could pay the check at which point Jamie went to the manager and got about another $30 off from complaining. Now for the food...  spinach stuffed mushrooms were the best thing I had there they were delicious I would definitely go back for them. Fried calamari was so salty it was disgusting and very chewy. We sent it back and got the avocado roll, two people out of the four liked it it was way too spicy for me couldn't even eat it. It did not look like the picture. Jamie and I got grilled shrimp over quinoa bowl with asparagus mushrooms peppers onions etc. I thought the quinoa and all the vegetables are good the grilled shrimp was not grilled it was pretty much just boiled. Jamie didn't like the dish at all. Judy got the jambalaya that she couldn't even eat because it was way too spicy Jamie tasted it said it was way too spicy I totally stayed away from that. The manager ended up taking this off the bill. Pete got New England clam chowder and he had no complaints about it he liked it. Onto dessert... We had the Pizookie's.. My favorite was the triple chocolate you know me I love chocolate so it was great. The snickerdoodle which is seasonal was everybody's favorite, nice with the cinnamon, least liked was the cookies and cream the cookie seems to be not totally cooked so it tasted like raw cookie dough.  Overall I would not recommend this place.

So my review is just in regards to football Sunday, I have no idea how it is the rest of the week. The first time we went for a Dolphins game and we made sure to arrive early. There aren't a lot of TV's (which is why I gave this place a 3 instead of 4 star!!) so we were a little worried we wouldn't get to see our game. The manager saw us walk in and approached us saying he wasn't sure which game he would put on but since we arrived early wearing our Dolphins gear he'd put us on alongside the Giants game!! Sweet!! When we scored our first score during the game, we tried to order shots. We were having trouble deciding what shot we wanted because they didn't have a lot of our usual go-to's. Then our bartender walked up and surprised us with special shots he'd made that were Dolphins teal!! So super awesome of him to think quickly on his feet like that and give us such great customer service!!  I came back a few Sunday's later in the evening for a Giants-Cowboys game. It was pretty packed but I have to say our waitress never lost sight of us. She was very attentive the entire game, even though she had tons of big tables. I ordered the baked ziti that night and it was so freaking amazing. I wasn't sure if I should order pasta from a non Italian restaurant, for fear it would be bland or not done well. I am so glad I took the waitress's advice and ordered it!! I am still thinking about that ziti 2 weeks later!! It was soo good!!  We came back this past Sunday and had a tough time with the fact that there were so little TV's. For a sports bar, you'd really expect the entire bar area to be covered in TVs so that you can actually watch all the football games on a Sunday. The past 2 times we came it didn't really affect us but this past week was kind of a bummer having to watch just 2 games. I think more tv's in that area would really up the appeal.

Our biggest disappointment came with the entrees......5 of us ordered the bacon-guacamole deluxe burger, all 5 of them were cold in the middle, all of them were either medium or medium rare so you can imagine the taste of cold rare meat. I honestly don't believe they make fresh meat burgers, I think they microwave precooked frozen patties, either that or they must have been sitting on the kitchen countertop for a very long time.To be fair I have to say that we made them aware of this issue and they offered to bring us something else but we refused.

Their is a LARGE bar area as well (For all my drinkers out there) as dining room seating is provided. This is a good restaurant to go to when you want quality food and to watch the game with an array of beers and alcohols. Plenty of tv's as well to watch sports. The noise level was average but that was mainly because Giants game was on this particular evening. I would say it is kid friendly based on noise level and type of crowd. They also have a pretty solid kid menu. The negatives are service both times i have been here could have been better waiting forever to get your food and the waiter or waitress disappearing for long periods of time. Even though the friends i was with only had drinks all night and me the only entree thats not an excuse. our server in particular tonight had an attitude and made a couple of errors on orders. All that said I like the food and atmoshere and will avoid our server next time lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=60,2.84,2.84,2.84,3.1160000000000005,2.84

For starters the menu is insanely huge...it's like a book. Bigger than the cheesecake factory's menu minus the advertisements.  It was a bit overwhelming but everything was categorized so well and looked amazing.  They have a nice selection of craft beers and also beers brewed by BJ'S themselves.  My friend and both ordered Alabama Slammer for a cocktail. Well I loved it! I had two of them. I decided to go with pizza...i had the spicy pig tavern cut pizza. It was huge but I wanted it all to myself lol. I hate a little more than half and took the rest to go.  It consisted of  ham, smoked bacon, pineapples, and jalapeños.  It was pretty spicy but worth it.  Overall though the menu has everything from pizza to burgers to pastas and ribs, steaks, chicken etc. appetizer, small plates, soups ..and on on. I need to go back a bunch of times to try a little bit of everything.  Our waitor that evening was very attentive and informative, so kudos! This place is definitely what Teterboro needed...there isn't any restaurants in the area and I'm so glad that BJ'S opened here. But fair warning it does get very packed on the weekends especially before 9 p.m. so do expect a wait but you won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.152,2.92
137,Edward E.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-09,Okay so I've been here plenty of times. Basically just to drink and bs. The most recent time I came here I was very disappointed and disgusted. I bought some cousins who came from Texas during the holiday season. We bought another family member who was underage and we clearly stated it to the waiter. Asking for shots for everyone except the driver. Everything was cool until the manager Maxwell. I repeat MAXWELL. (He told me to remember his name). Came to our table and told us any underage drinkers and we would go to jail with such an attitude. Remind you I told the waiter there was one underage person who was not drinking.  Now I never been so furious but I remained calm and said you know what I never write reviews but I am going to write one about this experience. So thank you Maxwell. You don't deserve to be a manager. You do not even deserve to be a bus boy in this establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=100,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.8520000000000003,2.76

I got wings and spinach and artichoke dip. The wings were ok way too salty. The ranch that came with them was unbearably salty as well. The dip was not bad but it was presented so ugly. I couldn't help but laugh. The bowl was only filled halfway but there was burnt crusts on the edge of the bowl and like 3 little sprinkles of parmesan cheese on top. Then the food came, I got a burger. Half of it was median and the other half was well and overall it was too salty. My friend got fried fish tacos, they smelled so fishy when they were set in front of us. For some reason 3/4 of the fish was battered and the pieces that were battered, it was barely hanging on. It was actually funny how bad everything was. On a positive note, the berry cider was good and Reina, the bartender was super nice. Id probably come back for her but nothing else.

141,Sylvia V.,"Maywood, NJ",4,24,,4.0,2017-01-16,My family and I came here for the first time. It is a very nice restaurant the staff is very well trained. Everything flowed smoothly and everyone work together as a team. I had the barbecue ribs and my husband had the seared tuna salad my son also had the ribs. The ribs were one of the best I've ever had in a long time they had a very good crust on the outside and we were tender and moist on the inside the meat was generous and it was seasoned very well that you really didn't need any barbecue sauce. The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the side dishes I selected. The roasted brussel sprouts we're very dry it seemed like they were sitting around for a while. And also I did not like the way they presented the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad it was over seasoned and overdressed with salad dressing. I was anticipating sliced fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes but all I got were little Marbles of mozzarella and cut up tomatoes. My husband enjoyed his tuna salad and the tortilla soup and my son also enjoyed the ribs and mashed potatoes were very good. Definitely must go for the beer nice selection. I would have given this place a 5-star if it wasn't for the lousy side dishes. And may I also add  they gave you a very cheap  amount of side dishes.

The Amber was probably the best while the Octoberfest and Lager were pretty mild and bland. The IPA was at least flavorful, but I didn't get as much citrus or floral flavor from it as others. The food is similarly just above average with good wings and ok flatbread pizza. The burgers looked good and were quite popular.

46,Kyle H.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",367,230,34.0,4.0,2017-04-12,"Newly opened, i was very impressed with the service as well as the atmosphere.  Food/Drinks: I LOVE the fact the company brews their own beers and has all your basics. I have had their IPA, Hefeweizen, and Blonde, all of which were delicious. They have many taps though so they also offer up a great selection from other craft breweries. If you're into the hard stuff they have a full bar which they can offer up some fantastic cocktails. Food wise I've had a few things including the burger and some sandwiches. The food is definitely good but not the best I've ever had. Nothing to go home and rant and rave about but it will do the job for sure.  Atmosphere: The atmosphere is undoubtedly cool, the bar area is partitioned from the dining area which i like but it is still one large open room. The bar is huge with plenty of TVs for sports and it has a great design that is really appealing. The dining area is very comfortable and i like the fact they can text you when they are ready to seat you. Everything seems very clean and orderly both in the dining area and behind the bar. Seems like a great place to go have a drink and catch the game or go with your family for dinner. Service: Service has been great every time i go. Surprisingly it is usually packed so expect a wait on a Friday or Saturday night. Wait times were short the one time i did have to wait and the staff was all very friendly. My favorite bar tender, Ilyas, is a great dude and ALWAYS takes care of me at the bar, he knows how to hustle for sure when its crowded which i can appreciate. Last time i was there he made an awesome suggestion for a beer cocktail mixing (2) of BJ's signature beers together and it was so good! You gotta love service like that Overall this place is great, it will only get a 4 star rating for me because the food is very ""chain-like"" may i say but this place is cool and i will absolutely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=40,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.248,3.6800000000000006

Mixed drinks: Nearly just juice --- Food: We started with the Queso with pork and Root-Beer Wings. The wings were super tasty however I wish they were not served room temp. In my opinion, the queso was pretty much just a chili. I'd have preferred it to be more discernible from a chili... or mark it as such on the menu.

We started off with the Frozen Margarita, White Peach Martini and Watermelon Mojito. All delish, but alcohol was lacking in all 3 drinks.  Appetizers consisted of Spinach & Artichoke Dip (delicious!), Ahi Poke (Eh...too heavily seasoned with soy sauce...not the best way to make it! We've tried various version of delicious Poke in Hawaii & LA).   For our meal, we had the Prime Rib set (meat was cooked perfectly, but a bit too fatty), Buffalo Burger (not as big as the picture) & the Peruvian Quinoa Bowl with Shrimp (not enough dressing, and it was just full of spinach and not enough quinoa and shrimp). All delicious, but it would have been nice if they spaced out the courses - a few minutes after the appetizers were brought to the table (which took longer than expected), they brought out the main course. Every inch of the table was covered with dishes, and we felt a bit rushed. For dessert, we tried the Pizookie which was included with the Prime Rib set. Pizookie is a cookie baked in a pan with a scoop of ice cream on top. We tried the chocolate chocolate chip cookie with chocolate ice cream and the Oreo cookie with vanilla ice cream - both delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=60,3.68,3.4,3.4,3.3440000000000003,3.5120000000000005

Again there was a problem with the timing of the service. Three of us were served our entrees and of course mine was the one missing. The server stopped by to see how the food was and saw I didn't receive mine, she apologized and went to check on it. I thought it was odd that mine was held up because I only ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries seeing as though we also had a prime rib dinner and a baked pasta dish? Anyway someone then brought my sandwich but I really didn't care for it. The pork was really fatty and the roll wasn't soft. The coleslaw on the side was terrible the vegetables were chopped in rather big pieces and had very little dressing. The fries were the best part. I really regretted ordering it. Of course everyone else at the table was done eating well before me and the server came to clear plates and asked if I was done. I joked with her that I was sorry I was behind but I got a late start.  Anyway... I loved my dessert last time I was here but this time not so much. Now again another problem with the timing of the food delivery. We ordered 2 desserts for the table. 1 mini and 1 full size  Pizookie. So this time the full size came alone first which makes no sense to me. So I ordered the Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie since it looked so good in the pictures but after tasting it I thought it was way too sweet.

As crowded as it was I had a great experience at the bar. I couldn't decide between a few beers and the gentleman, Ilyas, gave me two samples to try. I ended up expanding the horizons and going with a new beer! There are lots to choose from that looked interesting so I really appreciated this kind of service from the bartender, even in a high volume time! Extremely friendly too. Super impressed with the service and selection at the bar. Dinner, after we had a couple drinks at the bar we were seated for dinner. While our waiter was a kind person, we were extremely delayed in receiving our food. He did not write our order down and had to return to the table to ask us several times. Hungry people, patience is difficult! While he was great about interacting with us, this was real poor process being implemented here in the service.  The Nanuet location of BJ's had tremendously good appetizers and entrees. I chose the same items on the menu for appetizers, wings and stuffed mushrooms. Both were extremely disappointing in how tiny the food was. Only large mushrooms should make the cut. I was so excited for these tasty mushrooms I had in nanuet, and I was highly disappointed! The food was also cool. I am considering giving it another try in the future as the crowds potentially settle down. It is a great establishment with an awesome sports bar / family bar feel. Nice ambiance, super clean. Lots of tv's for sports.

The hostess at the front who took my name was kind and friendly.  Because there was a long wait, we decided to sit by the bar. We were helped by gentlemen the whole night at the bar who acted like he hated his job and can care less to lose it. First of all, The first think we order is sparkling and he puts the glasses in front of us and the bottle and doesn't bother to open it. We waited and waited and then asked if he could open the bottle for us and he did with the comment "" I don't know why people expect us to open it. It's pretty simple"". I know how to open a bottle of champagne. But yet I've never experience going to a restaurant that doesn't open it for you. We had to keep approaching him to order a drink or food. He didn't bother asking us what we wanted. If everything was good. If we needed something else. Even after the drink was empty and the plates were empty. He didn't bother once. He left all the empty plates and glasses pile up on the bar. He didn't bother taking it away. When we ordered a frozen margarita and all the other drinks, He didn't even put a straw. All the drinks he made that night for us and for other people kept spilling. It would overflow and wet everything. I wanted to record him so that management can see the money they lose with all the spilling but I didn't want to seem rude. The service provided by this gentlemen was horrible.

After driving by this restaurant multiple times my boyfriend and I were  excited to finally try it the other night but instead we left disappointed. The majority of the workers there are young teens who are quick to give attitudes without any regard for true customer service. Beside my table sat a couple who after telling their waitress they were unhappy with their meal were yelled at and told she wouldn't take it off of the bill. After they requested to speak with a manager, another unpleasant server walked up to the table and responded with, ""well he isn't here now so what do you want to do?!"" (WOW I thought). Besides the quality of the staff being bad, the food was also distasteful. I had ordered a BBQ pulled pork sandwich that was sent out to my table finally after 40 minutes, which was undercooked! My boyfriend had ordered a deep dish ziti that was brought to us cold. Our waitress was nowhere to be found the majority of the time which left us to ask other waitresses for napkins and silverware that had never been given to us even after receiving our food. After witnessing the lack of customer service given to others and being given countless attitudes, all we wanted to do was pay our bill and get out!

I LOVED my pita tacos. The pita was very soft and perfectly chargrilled, the broccoli slaw and crunchy apples added a nice texture, and the salmon was cooked beautifully. The only thing I would change about the dish is the seasonal bistro grains on the side. It's essentially a quinoa salad, but I feel like it didn't complement the Greek-style tacos very well. My boyfriend thought his Cali chicken club was good, especially the garlic sourdough bread. But he didn't like the fries on the side. He said they tasted similar to diner fries - too crunchy on the outside and hollow in the middle. We both enjoyed the Berry Burst Cider though! Great fruit beer. As for the Churro Pizookie, YUM. Just a suggestion though - if you like fresh and crunchy churros, ask for the vanilla ice cream on the side. By the time my boyfriend and I got to the churros under the ice cream, they were super soggy. Like Harry P. here on Yelp said, BJ's is ""basically a nicer Applebee's"".

I've been meaning to come here ever since it opened in the busy Teterboro Landing plaza. There's plenty of parking available for customers. The inside of the restaurant was spacious with plenty of seating at the bar and rest of the dining area. They have a large board with all the beer selections which is pretty cool. The atmosphere was slightly above casual. I didn't really see a lot of families in here. They have a nice selection of items on the menu. They have certain specials each day for example on Mondays the tavern pizza and deep dish pizzas are half-priced! The food/beverages are moderately priced. I ordered the Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos was about $13. The salmon on there was cooked beautifully. I loved the grilled pita bread - one of the best parts. There were hints of maple flavor which tasted great with the candied pecans. There's also a Greek yogurt cream dressing over the broccoli slaw with small slices of apples. I loved the apple slices which added a nice touch, but I didn't care much for the broccoli slaw. For me, it didn't mesh well. There was  also a side of quinoa salad which was unnecessary for the entree. It didn't taste all that great. Along with my meal, I ordered a pina colada because I'm not really a beer person. I was hoping for the sweetness from the coconut flavor and hints of pineapple to come thru but it didn't. I tasted more alcohol than the actual pina colada flavor. It was a little disappointing especially paying $12 for it. I probably should've just ordered one of their other non-beer drinks such as whiskey sour which I usually love. The waiter we had was very nice. The waiters/waitresses take your order on a mobile tablet which is efficient! I would love to come back and try their pizzas which seems to be popular here (don't know why I didn't get that).

29,Camille C.,"Englewood, NJ",109,38,27.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"The food was good but the staff is near horrible.  I kid you not, 2 hostesses and a server were arguing with each other when I came in. The hostess in the very front had her back to me for quite some time before I could even get a greeting and put my name down for a party of 3. Then I was told the wait time would be 15-20 min. I thought, ""yeah right"". It's prime time for dinner crowd and all the tables are full. But restaurants always say that so whatever. (It was 41min until we got seated).  It seemed like forever. My father got impatient and asked how many people are in front of us. She said 2. I lost count but I'm pretty sure 4 parties or 3 got seated first.  We finally got seated at a handicap table big enough for 6 people. But again, whatever, that's what was available at the time. Waiter comes to our table with a tablet for ordering. ""What's up guys welcome to BJ's"" My father takes forever to order and asks a lot of questions and changes his mind...frustrating for the waiter I know. But the waiter shows his frustration and rushes through the order with his hand on his hip while he waits. Then he struggles with he tablet. Takes my order. I get a water. ""Would you like a lemon or no lemon?"" ""No lemon please"", I say.  ""And for your entree?"" ""Can I have the bacon cheeseburger but no mayonnaise and no pickles?"" ""Okay bacon cheeseburger. How would you like it cooked?"" ""Well done, but no mayonnaise no pickles please"" ""Ok"" ""You got the no mayonnaise no pickles part?"" ""Yes"" ""What would you like with the burger?"" ""Oh I thought it was fried?"" ""There's sides on the page with meat"" turns pages quickly in my menu to the page with sides. (Nice to show me options but he was really impatient) ""That's okay, I'll just have fries"". Food comes for my 8 year old sister. She gets a garlic knot and small fruit cup which was nice.  Appetizer of fried calamari comes out. Looks amazing. Cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Waiter nearly slams small plates on the table in passing.  Entrees come out.  Before we even take a bite of anything the waiter comes and asks if everything is okay with the food. My dad just says yes and the waiter walks away.  My sister got regular French fries instead of the happy face fries he took the time to explain and we chose. Again, whatever... My father food is correct. He got a soup in some kind of bread bowl or something. He liked it. I got my burger and fries and it looks AMAZING. I put the bun on top and it has a sauce on it...it's not mayonnaise but some kind of creamy sauce. There was no sauce on the description otherwise I would have told them to take it off. But I was annoyed because even wiping it off would still leave the taste on it. I take a tiny bit of the bread with sauce and it actually tastes good so I don't say anything. I put the burger together and take a bite.  There's pickles... I was upset by now. I confirmed that he heard me say no pickles no mayonnaise but there is sauce (not mayonnaise so okay) and pickles.  I just take the pickles out and put them aside. I don't dislike pickles, I just didn't want to have pickle breath all the way back home... I drink my water and there's a lemon in it... I feel like the waiter did this in purpose. How can the order be so incorrect??? I didn't complain about any of it. Someone once teased me and asked why I'm so polite to employees when I shop or eat. I never give staff a hard time unless it's really serious. But he clearly didn't wanna be there and had a terrible attitude. He was impatient even though ""wait"" is in the word ""waiter"". I know he was in a hurry and frustrated with how many menu questions we had but that should be common, especially since it was first time there.  The only person who seemed nice was the girl at the end who bussed our table. I hope the staff I didn't encounter is more friendly then the ones I did. It's a shame since the food tastes so good. Maybe good food is all it needs though. It's in a busy location and was packed with customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=20,3.84,3.6,3.6,3.14,3.696

But let's get to what matters: the amount of beers they offer (including a nice chunk they make themselves) are most excellent (get their 'taster' flight!) and I almost never bother with desserts but when you see something called a 'pazookie' you can't help but find room for one more course. Churros - hot, sugary, oily Ice cream - cold, creamy, silky How did it take mankind so long to realize they need to be together at the same time?! More expensive than other chains but the portions are more than generous (we ate lunch and skipped dinner later that night).  But be warned: that churros pazookie is for a limited time I'm being told.  (Shame on you BJ's!)

They have a wonderful hefty selection of beer and the menu is huge with the most options you could imagine. I always choose different things when I come here, it really depends on my mood. I have ordered the half rack ribs, with broccoli and mashed potatoes on the side. I have also ordered numerous salads, sandwiches, the spinach dip is bomb! I sometimes even order a beer when I feel like. The vibe here is real cool, chill and young.  The place is really one of a kind, in my opinion. I do have to say though, certain days and weekends it gets crazy packed due to football games and other events, like soccer or a fight. It's a young crowd but also I tend to see a bunch of families come in all the time! The place is gigantic and sort of sectioned off so you don't have to be close to the bar with your family. The food is an 8.5 out of 10!  I have always chosen great meals here. There was one time it was busy and the food seemed a little rushed and sloppy, the manager remade it and didn't charge me. So I continue to come back, I appreciated the fact that they actually felt bad/sorry. They weren't rude and they didn't even think twice about doing it.

The restaurant is in the plaza of Teterboro next to Texas Roadhouse. The interior was pleasing; seating area and a bar. Since our wait was twenty minutes we went to bar to order some drinks. I ordered the gin and tonic, and it was really good. Shout out to the bartenders! They didn't make my drink watered down or taste like straight up gin.  When we sat down our waitress was really good to us. I wish I remembered her name because she was very nice to us and patient as well! We ordered their sriracha Brussels sprouts as an appetizer (so yummy)! And for entrees they had a deal if you order a prime rib you can get a soup/salad, two sides and a ""pizookie"" which is their famous dessert . I didn't like their Caesar salad but their broccoli with cheddar was very good. The prime rib was delicious too but we couldn't finish it since we got full from the appetizers, soups and salads!

The restaurant has plenty of space with both regular tables and booths available, all with line of sight to at least 2~3 TVs.  Beer list is also extensive, though I feel that pricing may be slightly higher than some of the other local bars/restaurants. In terms of food, the menu is not for the indecisive.  The menu itself probably weighs close to 5 lbs or a little over.  Tried the spinach dip, it just didn't work for me.  The burger was also just so so.  Felt extremely greasy and the beef didn't really have much flavor.  The California chicken club and clam chowder were both pretty decent.  Didn't get a chance to try to deep dish or pizookie.  Perhaps next time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro,3.8,3.68,3.68,2.9880000000000004,3.728

The second time I got the Southern Comfort sandwich with fried chicken, ham, bacon, and alfredo sauce - again really yummy food. my other friends got dishes with salmon and greens, and some sort of chicken steak sandwich. One person wasn't a fan of their chicken steak sandwich and expected a different taste I guess. But over all we loved the vibe and the different choices on the menu. For dessert, they have their special - the Pizookie. TRY THEM. Our table tried the classic, the churro, cookies and cream, and the monkey bread. They were SO good.

From the portly floor manager and the snooty server tiffany the service is at best poor. I prefer to have my server listen to my order when taking it when I go out. That did not happen. I used to bartend and wait tables and good service is the easiest part of the job. I also understood that if I made a mistake or the customer was upset its too easy to apologize and try to fix it.  So in summary, Tiffany ensured the visit to BJ's was underwhelming. The manager on the floor who was reluctant to try and fix the issue and really didn't care shows that its a systemic problem here from the top trickling down to some of the staff.

Came here for lunch with hubby and we shared clam chowder and Ahi poke as apps. Main courses were avocado bacon burger and a grilled ham and cheese.  Food was delicious and our server was very attentive, but I have two pet peeves when I'm dining and today they seemed to nail both lol.  I do NOT like being called by name every time my server visits my table. No reason to call me by name almost forcibly because they ask you when you arrive if you are an awards member. They then print out your info and place it on your table for your server. I understand maybe someone in corporate thinks this makes your visit more personable, but I don't feel that way.  Second, do NOT bring my main course out when I'm eating my appetizer 5 minutes later. I hate being rushed when I'm eating. And I really hate feeling claustrophobic with plates and having my main course get cold as I'm still eating my apps.  Our server was great and I don't knock him for this visit because I'm certain he was simply doing what he was told to do. But corporate needs to revisit these policies, because it simply becomes an unenjoyable dining experience.  Overall I've found better choices today within their TOO expansive menu (yes it's like ten pages long which is a blessing and a curse), but I do enjoy their food.

After she gave the check to us and the couple next to us, she gave that ear piercing hiss.  I'm not from Asia, nor do I work in the food serving industry, so I have no idea what this noise means.  But I do find this noise to be a negative reaction..  When she was hissing at both parties, I pointed at her and hissed back.  The waitress with her hair up & big glasses laughed and hissed back, as a defense mechanism to show what we were doing was normal..  Nah.. that's not normal to me. I would of left her a 1¢ tip, but we agreed that we wanted to come back at half priced Tuesday's one night for wine. So we left the customary 20% tip.  However, on the ride back, we agreed just to stay home on Tuesday's with our own wine and order pizza to be delivered.  Owners and management at BJ's, X out that hissing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro,3.64,3.67,3.67,,3.6580000000000004
34,Kevin A.,"NJ, NJ",6,20,,2.0,2018-01-07,"4 of us, at a busy time and they got us in pretty fast. Heard they only take reservations if your party is of 6.  Waitress took a bit to get to us, like 10 minutes. Our group was talking, so no biggie, but would have like to have got a drink order in. Waitress came, and 3 of us ordered their beers, which tasted good and a good price. Menu a bit big, alot of pages, but NBD. Told specials, and we ordered. Had two apps between the 4 of us, and hubby had a salad.  All apps and salad came out together. Hubby did not like that, but rolled with it. We're maybe half way/5 minutes into apps, and then our food comes out. Um NO we don't want them right now. One food runner says we'll keep them heated in the kitchen. Um NO to that too. We had medium rare steaks and burgers and pasta. Got the manager, and all fixed. Another manager comes over, sorry sorry, ok .. Then waitress says we'll give you a free veggie with meal. Hmmm .. weird but ok .. Two steak folks said was just ok, another had pasta that he liked alot, and my burger was good, but guac on it was tasteless. OK deserts. May try again, but usually when I say that, I never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=20,3.56,3.66,3.66,,3.6200000000000006
7,Lauren K.,"Emerson, NJ",4,2,1.0,1.0,2018-01-09,"I've ordered from this place a few times, and each time they have messed up my order. Today was the last straw as I ordered an Asian Chopped Salad and they gave me the Santa Fe Salad. The box was marked with the right salad but the wrong salad was inside. Bear in mind the Santa Fe Salas has avocado in it, which is why I did not order it. I am allergic to avocado! If I did not look at the salad before eating it, I would have had a terrible allergic reaction. Will never be ordering from this place again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro,3.4,3.66,3.66,,3.5560000000000005

20,Elaine C.,"New York, NY",36,17,13.0,3.0,2018-01-11,"I didn't think they were up to par with my first dining experience here, but they sure made up for it this time around.  We ordered a few beers and some margaritas and paired it with a calamari appetizer suggested by our waiter.  I'm not much of a calamari fan, but it was decently prepared.  My son received a fruit serving and a piece of twisty bread.  When I tried my blackberry margarita,  the taste was overpowering in an unusual way.    Granted it was strong, but the ingredients were not proportioned the right way.  We ordered our entrees and about 10 minutes later a ""gentleman/ manager/ host"" approaches our table and advises me that I cannot have my entree since they didn't have anymore to prepare until 30-45 minutes later.  I was not going to wait that long especially when my husband's dinner was already on its way out and my son had his main course as we nibbled on the calamari!  When the waitress stopped by our table and had the mandarin pork chops, I thought I must be on some reality show just to see how I would react.  When I advised her it wasn't mine, she gave my husband his entree and said she would return with my food and apologized.  A minute later, my waiter returns with the pork chop and says this is your dinner.. Enjoy!!  I was in total shock and couldn't believe what had just happened!!!  By the way, I had a free dinner and enjoyed every bite of it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro?start=20,3.36,3.66,3.66,,3.5400000000000005
1,Winnie Y.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",208,168,946.0,3.0,2018-01-11,"I've been here a couple of times. Not great but not bad at all. It is a great place to take friends that are less adventurist when it comes to food.  The Great: 1. Ahi Poke - this dish is amazing. Ahi with Avocado and wanton chip makes this dish an explosion of texture and flavor.  2. The Pizookies - Warm cookies with ice cream and whip cream on top. My favorites are the Macadamian Nut and White Chocolate Chip and the Cookies and cream.  The Not So Great: 1. Prime Rib Special - I tried their prime rib special once. If you like your steak with a side of fat. Please get this. If not, stay away. I like my steak with even fat distribution.  2. Burgers - Not a big fan of their Burgers. Actually i'm not a big burger fan at all. So I might be a little bias.  Service: Service is usually okay. We got a free pizookie due to kitchen mess up so I can only assume its a hell hole in there. We also asked for a water refill multiple times but continued to wait 30+ mins for it.  Other Minor Details: Parking can be difficult as it shares the same parking lot as Costco, Walmart, Texas Road House.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restauarant-and-brewhouse-teterboro,3.36,3.65,3.65,,3.5340000000000003
