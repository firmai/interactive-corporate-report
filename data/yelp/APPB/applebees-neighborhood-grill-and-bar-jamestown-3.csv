Gabrielle B.,"Chicago, IL",176,76,127,4.0,8/19/2017,"Hit up Applebee's because it is a reliable chain and our roadtrip led us through a generally sparse area. Waitress was quick and helpful. Facility was clean and updated, with tablet devices at each table. In general my reason for 4 stars has nothing to do with this specific location, but more to do with the general menu- Applebee's could be better with vegetarian friendly offerings. I had a thai shrimp salad, $12.49 and only 390 calories. It was very filling and had a pleasing taste, even a little on the spicy side, which was satisfying and surprising, considering this is a generally American traditional menu. Just needed to put in a good word for Applebee's considering the media is blaming millennials for the demise of the chain. Thanks Jamestown! Ps: visit the world's largest buffalo while you're in town!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Paige C.,"Deer Park, NY",2,3,72,4.0,8/19/2017,"Pleasant experience. Clean establishment, loved the local photos of the community on the wall, attentive and nice server. Cannot imagine why this has less than a 4 star rating. Applebee's is an American classic and nice to see in a town that is unfamiliar to a visitor like me who doesn't want to risk trying something new on the road - you can always rely on Applebee's for delicious food and efficient service. This one didn't disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Vishal S.,"St Paul, MN",33,592,119,2.0,5/11/2017,"Typical Sysco food... there is not much for restaurants here ( good ones), you usually see the run of the mill in these parts of town. I'm sure there are good classy places here I just was not able to find them so I got stuck at this joint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Mike P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,1.0,9/4/2016,"Well we went to Grizzlies because service was terrible. Walk into Applebee's and apparently these folks were trained by the same people. Save yourself and if you have to eat in the area, go to Las Carretas. The staff was polite and welcoming. Do not go to Applebee's, they really do not want you there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Jon D.,"Hopkins, MN",30,3,6,1.0,7/17/2016,We left after waiting 15 minutes for service after sitting down. Multiple staff members walked passed us and no one said anything.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Dave W.,"Jamestown, ND",0,4,,5.0,9/8/2016,Bartender was excellent.  Food was delivered quickly and was delicious.  The manager even stopped to check on us.  We'll definitely go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3

Patrick N.,"Immokalee, FL",0,3,,1.0,6/20/2016,"We love Applebee's, but this restaurant was shockingly bad. We waited 50-55 minutes for our food after ordering. The food was good, but certainly not worth the wait. Try Perkins next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Mauricio S.,"Canyon Country, CA",56,37,7,2.0,4/3/2015,Service was really friendly.  Nice atmosphere.  Good spot for drinks after work or a casual date.  Food tasted great but I think the shrimp gave my girlfriend mud butt.  I am fine.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Dawn B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/20/2016,"Waited for almost an hour for our food. I was told the wait was because I ordered a pork chop and it takes long to cook. There were 4 guest who sat down after we were seated who were paying for their food while we still waited. The manager never came to our table, the waitress tried to be sympathetic. When our food came the only thing that was hot was the pork chop. Vegetable and sweet potato fries cold.  Horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Adrienne H.,"Bottineau, ND",9,2,,1.0,8/12/2016,Bad management. Appetizers and salads shouldn't be held in the back till meals are ready.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Brad G.,"Hannaford, ND",2,2,,1.0,2/28/2016,My husband and I go out t eat most Saturday night we have eaten many good meals here.  But over the past year the menu and food has gotten progressively worse!  The wait staff is great but the food is at times barely edible! We going to search out new restaurants!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Chris J.,"Crookston, MN",0,30,10,1.0,9/17/2015,As soon as you walk in the smell of sewage engulfs you. It was like this about two weeks ago and I said something and left. I do like apple bees in general but came back again tonight and it seems to have gotten worse! Walked in smelled it and walked out. 9-17-15,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Mean Eyed C.,"Le Sueur, MN",0,154,,1.0,5/28/2014,"Very strong dirty burnt oil smell and smoke filling the place, good drinks and waitress Food was basically un edible, waitress acknowledged the stink and haze in the bar, told us it is a dirty fryer and it would smell worse if they turned it off! Better options in town",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
tom h.,"Issaquah, WA",0,19,1,1.0,3/25/2016,Terrible service.  Understaffed. Took 10 minutes just to get a menu. Left after 20 minutes without service. Others around us are more patient. They had been looking at their menus even longer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
Pamela C.,"Wimbledon, ND",0,1,,1.0,9/21/2015,"Smelled like sewer was backed up. When we questioned it, hostess seemed reluctant to answer. Since it was after 9:00, not many other choices of places to eat. Food was okay, but don't think I would return cuz of the smell. The waitress did a great job with service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
David C.,"Philadelphia, PA",40,70,8,3.0,10/28/2011,It's your typical Applebees with mediocre service. It was the only familiar restaurant in the area so we had to deal with it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jamestown-3
