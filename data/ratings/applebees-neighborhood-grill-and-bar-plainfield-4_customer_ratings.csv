15,Mary D.,"Brookfield, IL",0,44,,1.0,2013-03-09,"I went there as I had a meeting in the area.  A little before noon, I was one of 3 people in the whole restaurant, lots of wait staff milling about.  My server was prompt and friendly, but my half a salad took over 15 minutes to arrive.  I wish I'd ordered the whole.  For $8 I figured I'd get enough to tide me over til dinner, but it was a small 9 inch plate that was about 2/3 covered with a thin layer of lettuce with a little bit of chicken.  No roll, nothing on the side.  For $8 I can get a huge salad with a side at Panera down the road in half the time. The server was really good, and was really trying, but I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
12,Patricia G.,"Orlando, FL",272,373,716.0,2.0,2013-07-28,"This Applebee's is really something.... and not in a good way. I dined here before heading to the airport for lunch. I've dined at my local Applebee's in Orlando, FL and had really great food, but this one was terrible.  We started with some spinach and artichoke dip which was probably the best thing I had in that lunch. I ordered the new wedge salad and I could barely eat it because the lettuce had an odd taste to it. I do not know if it was the water they used or if some chemical got into it. Needless to say I just had them take it away. When my sirloin steak came it was almost raw inside. Yes, I did order mine medium rare because I feel like these places tend to overcook sirloins but I did not order it very rare. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was because of the way management handled my undercooked steak situation. It was brought back to me and it was still kind of undercooked but I was so full from the mashed potatoes and the dip I couldn't dig into it. At the end the manager told me she was going to take care of the steak for me since it wasn't cooked right and it took a while for them to make me a new one. I didn't even bring up with bad wedge salad... Overall: good service but terrible food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
10,Dan P.,"Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, CA",19,3,7.0,5.0,2014-02-03,I love this place! Everyone there is awesome! The food is always delicious and the servers and employees are always friendly and accommodating.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
14,Rachel F.,"Plainfield, IN",0,1,1.0,5.0,2014-02-19,We come in every week and we love it! They treat us like family and the food is always great. Ignore the negative reviews on here. its a great place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
9,Lisa E.,"Danville, IN",48,110,140.0,2.0,2014-10-26,"Normally the experience at an Applebee's is average or better.  Sadly this time we had a disorganized staff.  The meals came out in phases, meaning courses split apart from what they went with.  Burger first and 5 minutes or so later out came the fries.  Perhaps the kitchen staff was new, the serving staff didn't seem bothered with it or even concerned about it upon being asked.  A little less attentive to us than normal as we had to get someone's attention for a drink refill.  It will be a while before I return.  Hopefully they can improve things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
13,Jay E.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,2015-03-08,They messed up my order overcharge for sub par food with small portions and undercooked my wife's food 3 times I will NEVER go back again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
11,Yolanda M.,"Avon, IN",0,3,,5.0,2015-03-18,"I love this place. The staff is friendly and upbeat, the food is delicious! We shared the new nachos and quesadillas - amazing. The new menu is really out of the box for Applebee's, and a huge upgrade. Wow. Top it off with a kid-friendly atmosphere for our five year old. We'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
5,Tim G.,"Plainfield, IN",27,132,145.0,2.0,2015-07-02,"This place definitely needs some help. Once we got seated for dinner our server was too busy hitting on females to come over and help us. A Manager joe Roebuck saw my displeasure and grabbed our drink order for us since ""Server Trey"" was obviously too busy. Food was so-so. Steak way under cooked, don't know if I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
8,Michael B.,"Plainfield, IN",0,10,,1.0,2015-12-12,Pretty much a terrible late night  experience. No one came over for over 15 minutes. This will be the last time I ever spend any money here!  GM feel free to contact me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
4,NaTasha C.,"Indianapolis, IN",53,45,43.0,1.0,2016-04-20,If I could give it zero stars I would. 4 people in my party and we all ordered off of the express lunch menu. Service was slow and our food came out cold. The manager was unwilling to do anything to compensate for the horrible experience. Plainfield has plenty of restaurants  in the area but this is one I will never recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
6,Ben R.,"Abingdon, VA",4,1,,1.0,2016-04-23,"For starters I want to say me and my family love Applebee's. That being said this location has been our worst experience ever at any Applebee's. Started with walking in and there was no host/hostess so us and another couple waited for around ten minutes before even being acknowledged that we was there. Apparently the manger was also the host that night and he was horribly unkept, messy hair, scraggly unkempt facial hair, wrinkled clothes and a general unclean feel to him. The server was attentive thankfully and gave us good service. My wife asked for water with no lemon and after sending back the first water with lemon seeds at the bottom of the glass, and receiving a second glass with lemon seeds again on the bottom resigned herself to drink it. The food was generally good except the four cheese Mac and cheese was very watery and not flavorful. All in all was a very poor experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
7,Kevin M.,"Indianapolis, IN",16,10,1.0,2.0,2016-04-28,"Service is TERRIBLE.  Might just be this location. Plenty of staff, just not focused on service,gossip was mo potent",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
1,Speedway B.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,6,,2.0,2016-11-04,I just had a unpleasant experience at Applebee's Using a gift card I found out there was a term called tip tolerance that I was in aware of  I believe that their management should train their servers to properly handle this card so that they will avoid the conflicts that I just went through After giving them a $50 gift card and ask them to place the rest of the balance on my credit card The balance of the Bill did not match up to the $50 deduction The server had no answers so I checked the cards balance and it stated Applebee's had charge the full $50 against the card The management informed me it would apply a credit tomorrow on the card that did not get deducted Looking that term up on the Internet it states that they can run the full amount But that was not offered to me So I believe I will never use a gift card at an Applebee'sand I'm pretty sure that's because I won't ever go there About the service it was very good about the food I am just so so,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
2,Jennifer G.,"Yorba Linda, CA",3,12,,1.0,2016-12-26,Terrible service all around. Right off the bat the beer was barley cold. It took 30 minutes to get a Margarita. we had to chase the waiter down for water refill right after he filled the table next to ours and had half a pitcher left. Another server accidently made eye contact with me and imideately looked the other direction to avoid me and walked away quickly.  We sat down before a 10 top and 2 other 4 tops and ordered first and watched all of their food come out bedore ours. After almost 2 hours of not recieving food we walked out. Better luck never.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
3,James S.,"Plainfield, IN",7,6,,4.0,2017-02-24,Olivia was always a great waitress. Food is good and the management staff seems to care about your experience and quality of food and service. Been here several times always great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
0,Bee W.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,9,1.0,3.0,2017-10-11,"Great $1.00 Margaritas! I had grilled chicken (great) and fries and garlic green beans. The fries were warm and looked like what you find in the bottom of the bag, too many hard pieces to bother with and the green beans were mushy inside although they tasted good, they too were just warm and inedible. Their desserts, as always were great. Applebee's really ought to put a little more money into their fries and make sure customers are served hot food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-plainfield-4,,,,,
