Matthew D.,"Fairfield, CT",69,18,,3.0,10/5/2011,I mean...Its a TGI Fridays...they are all the same as far as food and drink options although this location does have some local beers.  I have been here a lot because I usually stay at the hotel across the street when I travel in the area.  You shouldn't expect a 5 star meal so if you go in knowing you are getting TGI Friday food and a relatively cheap meal then its fine.  The staff has always been nice and helpful.  Plenty of parking too (although as I said I usually walk across the street). Also - the past two times I have been its during the Bartender Olympics.  Kind of funny but also kind of sad at the same time.  They are definitely an entertaining staff...thats for sure.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Michael B.,"Chicago, IL",54,50,71,3.0,10/12/2010,"While the food was prepared really fast, and our waiter was really friendly, he was more interested in the table behind us and to me seemed like he was ""mingling"" more then actually offering his services. I mean don't get me wrong as everyone should be able to ""mingle"", but not to a point where it was getting to be 6-10 mins., after the order was taken. All in all, the food I think is really great and they do have a nice bar area, good to catch whatever sports game is on. The only thing that needs improvement is the wait staff's attention to his/her customers, other then that I would be back here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Abe A.,"Des Plaines, IL",35,43,1,3.0,11/5/2012,"Typical American ""Friday"" evening restaurant. The food is good. I do recommend the Pastrami sandwich. The Margarita's are good and very large. The decor nothing like a higher end restaurant. Service was good. The server did spend time flirting with a group of girls next to us. If you do not have time to make dinner or visit a higher quality restaurant this location is good for a quick dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Jessica V.,"Des Plaines, IL",192,126,137,2.0,11/7/2011,"TGIF!!! Wait....ummm let me rephrase that....(REEEWIND) It's Monday...so all I want is good food and good service. If you watch TV you know what I mean when you see the Friday commercials and everything looks cheery and the food looks exceptionaly great! However, maybe since I went on a Monday, which is the opposite of a Friday, that explains why I had a not so cheery experience... We walk in and we are greeted by a hotess. Next, we are seated in a booth and as soon as my guy sits down the seat breaks! How awkward! After all awkwardness passed we order the spinach and artichoke with tortilla chips. This is where I start to get pissed... First of all, I ALWAYS order the spinach dip and its always fresh, hot and comes in a super large bowl with a mountain of red, white, and blue chips. Super yummy and definately can be an entree because it is just that filling. However, when we ordered this bowl of .. whatever it was, it came out crusty as hell on the edges of the bowl as if it were microwaved for an extra 10 minutes then directed. It was a very small portion and they only gave us about 10 chips. 10!? What am I going to do with 10 chips ... starve? die of hunger. I was so disappointed with my app, especially since thats the only reason I go to TGIF. I mean the chips were so stale and hard it was gross. They used to be thin, hot and a tad bit oily - you know they fresh way!? But no, definately will try a spin-dip somewhere else. Last but not least, the main entree my guy got was the Jack Daniel's Burger. Super good, but they forgot to put Jack Daniel's sauce on the burger. I mean... come on... its a Jack Daniel's Burger... the sauce makes the burger. I don't know what was going on in the kitchen. I might come back at my own risk, but it will not be my first choice. It definately felt like a Monday, but thanks for trying Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Angelo C.,"Chicago, IL",80,240,136,3.0,12/4/2012,Just an OK experience. The avacado balsamic vingret was pleasantly different. The servers are friebdly but no name tags!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Debra G.,"Mount Prospect, IL",0,1,,4.0,6/6/2014,"My family and I go this to particular friday's very often. There is always at least 6 of us, sometimes over 10 of us. Every server we have had has been able to handle my crazy family and get all of our orders perfectly. Everyone there is more than willing to help us and always have answers to every question. The food is always fantastic as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
J J.,"Bridgewater, NJ",21,639,81,3.0,3/25/2011,"Not a bad burger.  Small portions of fries, rice etc.  service was terrible and slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Ana C.,"Niles, IL",104,9,,4.0,6/6/2013,"Great food, become a Stripes member and they email you tons of coupons that we use all the time. Service is good, definitely satisfactory. We've been going there all the time for the past 3 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Kelly C.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,2/3/2012,"This location of Fridays has the absolute worst service. I have been to many locations and never had an issue. My co-workers and I have given this location many chances on our lunch break and it seems it gets worse everytime. If you have any less than 2 hours to spend on lunch, STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!! They wonder why this location is continuously empty during lunch hours. FYI its because your servers are SLOWWWWWW!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Y. K.,"Glenview, IL",6,45,,4.0,8/16/2012,"I guess if you've tasted food at one TGI Fridays you've eaten at all of them.  However, not all have the same level of service.  This one was good in that sense.  The servers have personality, stay on their toes with your order and even the hostess goes out of her way to say goodbye when you leave.  All that doesn't hurt my hectic, stressful day at the office.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20

Vera Lynn W.,"Northbrook, IL",0,54,,3.0,3/25/2012,"Been here several times. It is always fair to middling, food wise. I had Yadira as a server. She was very good. No complaints. The boneless wings I ordered were too small. Too much breading; too little chicken. wouldn't order them again. Went back a few days later with my family. There were 8 of us. Henry was our server. He was Fabulous! Explained all the nuances of their menu, and was very patient with the lot of us. Everything came out just as ordered, even special requests. He was amazing. Kept our drinks full, both water and soda, which with 8 people is no mean feat. Now to the food. It was just ok. Nothing to write home about. Nothing to crave. I had the French onion soup. It was fine. Not great. Burger was better, but not very juicy. Would I come back here? Well, the location is convenient. So yes, but there are other places I'd rather go. Oh, and as an aside, if you order a drink at the bar and can watch them make it, it's ok. If you order at a table? It might as well be virgin. No alcohol whatsoever. Like they're saving that shot for the VIPs who are their regulars. Pass on a free dink and management won't know. 2 for food/ liquor. 4 for service. Average of 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview?start=20
Louis O.,"Niles, IL",0,21,,5.0,12/7/2014,"What the heck happened?! This place was a really terrific restaurant! What a shame if they closed forever.

Tricia D.,"Chicago, IL",523,1184,3689,3.0,3/18/2011,"Even though I had lived in this area for 2 years, I had never made it in here.  The parking lot was pretty full for 5pm on a Saturday, but it was more desolate inside.   My burger craving made it easy for me to order off the menu, and my friend noticed that it was included on the 3 course menu for $12.99, so for only $5 more, I got spinach flatbread and an oreo cookie ice cream sammich for dessert.  Not too shabby!  Add an ultimate long island iced tea on top of that, and I was definitely full.  The greatest part of the meal was the friendly service.  Our waiter was so chipper, we swore he popped right off of the Disney Channel!  Thank goodness for pleasant service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Jerry C.,"Chicago, IL",416,17,6,3.0,7/22/2014,"Came here with a couple of friends for the unlimited apps deal they have going on right now. We shared unlimited boneless wings, potato skins, mozzarella sticks, and bruschetta in addition to a couple of drinks. Our waitress was very good about putting our orders so that there was very little wait time in between our servings.  Most of the food was fairly average. The bruschetta was pretty solid every time. The chicken was unfortunately, mostly breading. Also the parmesan garlic sauce tasted more like butter than said flavors. The potato skins and mozz sticks tasted decent as well. We also shared the tenessee whiskey cake, which I thought tasted good. My mojito left a little more to be desired, as it was more lime and less mint than Id like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Ag C.,"Northbrook, IL",3,49,29,4.0,6/8/2014,"Pretty standard n decent. Had rib eye, gyoza, crispy fried chicken pieces, seared tuna on taco n a pork thing on pita.  Friendly service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Kristina W.,"Chicago, IL",19,29,13,4.0,8/30/2013,"Came here with family and our waitress was excellent! Her name was Chuka B (I made sure to take note of her name because she definitely deserves to be mentioned in this review). We had a party of 10 and she was very patient with us when taking our orders. Some members ordered the specialty lemonades and when they finished them, she made sure to mention that lemonade refills cost extra before whisking the glasses away. Not only was she informative, but also very customer oriented. For those who ordered steaks, she had them cut into it to see if it was cooked to their liking. I have never been to a restaurant where a waiter/waitress had the customers do that. Doing that is much better than cutting into it once they leave and then trying to flag him/her while you sit there going hungry. Excellent service from Chuka. I left that restaurant very content and happy with her service.  Food was good. I had the Jack Daniels burger which was tasty, but nothing to rave about. This review was just to mention the awesome service we had at TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",668,491,62,3.0,2/5/2012,"It's your typical and average TGI Friday's. Usually my orders are always entered wrong and since I'm a server I'm a lot kinder to the staff but I still have to repeatedly deal with inconsistencies in service and the way it is handled afterwords...  I had the Jack Daniels Grilled Chicken Sandwich and it was pretty good and filling. Couldn't finish the whole thing in one sitting but that's fine. I had a male waiter so this time was a little different in the sense that nothing was actually rung in wrong but overall the food is average and the service is what you pay for [but not in a good way, sorry].",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Katarina K.,"Wheeling, IL",133,30,23,2.0,10/26/2013,Food tasted like it was frozen and  warmed up in a microwave. for a salad. they  gave me a large piece of lettuce and small bites of tomatoes.  Shrimp and fries. was thrown on plate and served. Cant blame the waiters . they do their job right The cooks and TGI  need to up date their cooking skills.

Luis O.,"Libertyville, IL",76,53,2,2.0,8/28/2013,Service is iffy here. Luckily they have good happy hour and lunch specials.  The last time I came here with a group from work it took almost an hour for our food. Luckily we didn't have any meetings or else we would have been screwed! $3 apps and drinks on Thursday and $6.99 endless lunch can't be beat however!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Staci W.,"Chicago, IL",3,48,24,1.0,11/13/2014,"Horrible costumer service at the bar. Very inattentive, had to wait for about 25 minutes for anyone to ask us if we were ready to order food and since first thing we asked for was the menu you would figure we were hungry. How does that happen with two bartenders and total of 7 people at the bar (thats including us). Seriously?. I gave this place a try for a third time now, after not so great service last two times but no change. Definitely not coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Christine K.,"Glenview, IL",3,46,42,4.0,7/3/2014,i really like that this place is open until 2am. The staff at night is super friendly as well.

Kevin S.,"Skokie, IL",2,34,,4.0,5/19/2014,"$3 martinis AND 1/2 price bottles of wine AND 1/2 price appetizers on WEDNESDAYS.  I have come here every Wed for the last 4 weeks with friends - strictly for the specials.  It seems like Wed seems to draw in a crowd of regulars all there for the same reason.  Staff at the bar is always fun and helpful - especially Natalia.  ""Martinis"" include some specialty drinks like Cosmos so something for everyone.  Bottles of wine are reasonably priced.  LaCrema Chardonnay for $25 (before the 1/2 off) - Mid range vintages but mid-range prices - but 1/2 off makes them very reasonable for a restaurant.  Bar service is 5 stars - menu selection is 3 stars - just not enough healthy options.  Does the F in TGIF really stand for FRIED?  Regardless, you know what you are getting when you go here.  Definitely recommed on Wed for the specials",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Ron S.,"Morton Grove, IL",8,41,39,4.0,5/16/2012,"I know most people don't think much of TGI Friday's, but my wife and beg to differ.  The menu rotates/updates often, so we often try their new items. Last time, they had Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken. This time they had Korean Steak Tacos.

Heather H.,"Chicago, IL",83,233,18,2.0,5/7/2011,"Somehow TGIF is even worse than I remembered. I was forced to come here for a work lunch, so luckily I didn't have to pay.

Glenn R.,"Streamwood, IL",18,116,24,3.0,12/28/2010,"This TGI location is no different from the other TGI  chains you'll find in the city and the burbs.  The only thing different about this place is how slow the service is, especially around lunch time when you only have an hour for break with your co-workers.  We have given up on this place for a long time now, mainly due to the long wait for our food.  Recently though, we decided to go back as we've been receiving some TGIF promotional coupons like ""Buy one entrée get one free"" or ""Save 25% off your entire Bill"".  Each visit, the service has been very slow, about an hour and a half.    Im wondering if they are offering these promotional coupons to lure back customers?   Anyways, this place has been around the Glenview area for some time now and some of my co-workers whos been here longer than me talk about how good this place used to be.  Back then, the service was spot on, where you can expect to get good food and be in and out within the hour.  Now it seems the quality of the food had gone done, and the only way people are coming back is if they have a Discount Coupon.  My co-workers and I only come here when we have one of those ""Buy one entrée get one free"" coupons, and it is on a  Friday when we can afford a longer lunch time, say an hour and a half.  No wonder they call this place ""TGI  Fridays"", cause the only time people can afford to come here is on a Friday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Esther S.,"Chicago, IL",14,37,4,2.0,5/30/2011,"On the menu, the food at TGI looks like it will rock  your world.  It splashes of color and promises that this food will hit you in the face.   In real life, I got my food and the taste was unimpressive.  Every so often, I go back just to make see if it gets better.  In the past 10 years, it has not.  The food does not taste fresh and kind of oily.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
Grace L.,"Glenview, IL",59,247,4,2.0,9/6/2010,"I've been to this place for the past 10-12 years now, before and after it's remodel.  The service here is hit or miss, just like any chain place, but somehow this one has the most apathetic servers. Our latest visit last night included everything from someone opening the door for us and greeting us, which was nice...to our server talking to us but looking in a completely different direction, not just no eye contact, but complete disregard to who she was talking to. Our check was also presented with our desserts and then completely whisked away without warning by someone who was not our server. That person also did not even give us time to inform them that we wanted to split our checks, since she was in such a hurry that all I saw was her back.  We ordered off the 12.99 deal: appetizer, entree and dessert. Best app there that we like are the mozzarella sticks or the fried green beans. Entrees are of course just ok, but the Santa Fe salad is actually fairly large, so not a bad choice. Dressing has already been put in the salad, so put it on the side if need be. Chicken fingers are also a fairly safe choice. For those going for the 16.99--steak was a good choice, hey, 16.99 and steak..why not? For the two dessert choices, it's either peanut butter pie or vanilla bean cheesecake, so simple question: chocolate or not chocolate? Both desserts, however, have a lot of cream on them.  This Fridays is also a good place for a simple drink or to watch a game, there is a bar area in the middle of the restaurant with a few screens around.  The decor is kooky, mismatched...which is to be expected out any of these places, but there is a huge, bright vegas style KITCHEN sign over the what else, but the kitchen door. Just in case you needed to know where your food was coming out of.  Parking is ample most of the time since they have their own lot, and it is fairly visible next to a bridge and near the corner of Lake and Milwaukee.  Would love to give them more stars, but the service was fairly lousy tonight. Safe place for the usual ""kick back relax bring your family/friends we have a lot of drink and fried food choices""  standard chain fare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-glenview
