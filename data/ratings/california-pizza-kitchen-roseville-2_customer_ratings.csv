68,Sharon C.,"Rocklin, CA",46,113,28.0,3.0,2012-01-04,"Went there for dinner the other night with my family. Our waiter was very nice, but low stars for the time it took to get our food and the quality of the food.  We ordered a mac and cheese for our 2 year old. I hate when places feel the need to make fancy mac and cheese for the kids menu. This place used fusili noodles and the taste was so bland, a box of mac n cheese would've tasted better.  The place was not busy at all but it took forever for our food to come out. I had the korean steak bbq tacos and the spicy quesadilla. The tacos were terrible and should not be called ""korean steak bbq"" because the flavor was no where near taste korean bbq. The quesadillas were okay. My hubby had the BBQ chicken pizza. He was also not too impressed with the food either.  Also took forever to get our check so we could leave.

159,Mr. B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,40,,2.0,2012-02-21,"My wife and I have been coming to this location for the last two years all the way from Folsom ( once a week ). I never had such a bad experience like I had yesterday. I don't want to mention the server's name on yelp but... she did not look happy to be there or serve her tables. It started with the host/server (I don't know) that approached the host stand once she saw us waiting and without saying hi/ hello or smiling, just asked "" for two?"". Wow...I should have predicted this following experience. Next..... we sat at what appears to be a  servers section were one server takes care of that area. Well.... she (server) passed by our table around 3 times in 5-7 min without even acknowledging us or saying anything that will reassure us that we are not some two invisible ghosts siting at the table. waiting and waiting and finally the server sorted out the confusion of who's table is that ( I have watched it across the room). finally got her coming to the table and taking our order. Either she had no desire to be there or she does not know what customer service is?  We ordered the tortilla spring rolls which was nothing to get excited about. No flavor what so ever (even with the peanut sauce or guacamole(first and last time ordering that). next we waited around 20min ( after finishing our appetizer) which I can only conclude that the server forgot to put the order in (to be sent to the kitchen). By the way.... the two main courses were Grilled Vegetable Sandwich and BBQ chicken salad which served cold. so.... there was no reason for a 20min delay after we have finished the appetizer other than the fact that the meals have been not sent to the kitchen in time and the servers laziness and lack of attention to details. I served tabled in the passed for 8 years so... trust me that I know.  Had she realized how small is the appetizer and how quickly two people can finish it she would have timed it better.  Here is the best part of waiting 20min for the food. I received my sandwich and it was literally flat. there was almost (I am being generous by saying almost) nothing inside. there were two small slices of tomato on each side of the sandwich and the portobello  mushroom was barely to be seeing. It was just crazy that the cook will make an $10+ sandwich looking like this. I never in my life returned something back to the kitchen but that was a really poor excuse for a sandwich. embarrassing!!!! My server as usual was no were to be found so I flagged the manager and showed her the sandwich and asked her if they run out of vegetables because I can't see them on my sad sandwich. All she had to say is I am sorry (which is okay) but.. she did not look in shock or anything. she asked me if I want anything else but I was already fed up with our absent server and waited for the food to long so I said that I will pass.  Our wonderful server passed by our table several times without even realizing that my wife is eating ""alone"" and I have no food in front of me. did I manage to finish my meal within 10min and that is why there is nothing in front of me?.  Had she paid attention to her tables while passing by them several times and/or coming and checking on us after 5min of serving the food like any server should....she would have discovered that was going on. after a wile she did come by and said sorry about that (sandwich) and did mention that she does not like the sandwiches there because it is a pizza place and not a sandwich place.  Okayyyyyyy..... so first of all thank you for not recommending about not ordering this awful sandwich, second, if this is a pizza place so how come they have salds and fried egg rolls, tacos and ect....... what a B.S... the BBQ salad is great. the cook did not care not care, and the service was awful.  After leaving CPK, I went to CHIPOTLE for a burrito. It felt like something has changed in the management and staff.

146,Gregg U.,"Orangevale, CA",103,22,8.0,1.0,2013-07-30,"Visited in 2010...never went back. Service was bad. Pizza was like wet cardboard...and tasted quite ordinary--it was slimy and limp. I've had better pizza from Little Cesar's. We had reservations for a large group (about 15 or so) for a birthday party that we made a week ahead of time. The majority of the group were Italian-American. None of them liked the pizza. All of them hated the service...our reservations were set, and we had to wait over an hour for them to seat us...and the place did not even have that many customers when we were there. Not to forget the price...I'd rather buy a take 'n bake from Costco...more for the buck (we could have bought a dozen Costco pizzas for the price of the 5 or 6 we ordered that night). The servers did not get tipped...and they actually separated our group...so we had some sitting across the aisle, as if they were not part of the group.

Pizza was like wet cardboard...and tasted quite ordinary--it was slimy and limp. I've had better pizza from Little Cesar's. We had reservations for a large group (about 15 or so) for a birthday party that we made a week ahead of time. The majority of the group were Italian-American. None of them liked the pizza. All of them hated the service...our reservations were set, and we had to wait over an hour for them to seat us...and the place did not even have that many customers when we were there. Not to forget the price...I'd rather buy a take 'n bake from Costco...more for the buck (we could have bought a dozen Costco pizzas for the price of the 5 or 6 we ordered that night). The servers did not get tipped...and they actually separated our group...so we had some sitting across the aisle, as if they were not part of the group.

Our server, Gwen, was probably the best server we've ever had...in ANY restaurant we've dined it (and we've dined in many). I was in a fickle/indecisive mood to start with so it took us 30 minutes to even decide where to eat that night. But we landed here, and were excited about their new summer menu (strawberry salads, new refreshing drinks). We sat outside on their patio, and I started off with their new Rhubarb Martini drink that had orange, strawberry, and rhubarb root which I had never tasted before. The drink was nice and cold, refreshing, but immediately I could tell that I didn't care for the rhubarb taste-as it was similar to ginger for me. Gwen, our waitress could tell I didn't like it-and she was offering other options instead to replace that one. I said ""no no, it's fine""....I felt bad. I did like the sour taste of it, but just not the vegetable root taste ha. And she goes, well just sit with it awhile and if you still don't like it, I'll make you something else to try. I gave it a few more sips but just couldn't handle the Rhubarb so she threw out some other ideas, and I agreed to try a Plum martini. She was so sweet, kindly brought it out...but alas, was way too sweet for my liking. I ended up not drinking either, and she was so sweet about the whole thing and went above and beyond that any server would normally do. The caramelized peach salad I ordered was very tasty, especially with the gorgonzola cheese they use. I was expecting the peaches to be fresh, but I could tell they were from a can-so that was a bit disappointing. But other than that the salad was very good and perfect size (I ordered a half). Then we decided to go for their strawberry shortcake for dessert and I must say it was to die for. Fresh strawberries, with a strawberry glaze sauce, small little crystals of sugar sprinkled on top a house made biscuit/scone type thing. She also included vanilla ice cream for us with the whipped cream. It was really good. But above the food, I'm writing because this was our best experience (service wise)...really anywhere. Thank you Gwen! She was cheerful, helpful, gracious, and went above and beyond. CPK please give her a raise because she definitely deserves it.

Called CPK and the host picked right up saying there was no wait for 2 people...yay. Arrived and found place busy but definitely a few tables open. I could tell that CPK planned for a busy night, I've never seen so many staff in the kitchen and so many servers/table clean up help as I did this night.  Very efficient operation being run here. We were seated and within a minute our server Zachary arrived at table to take drink and appetizer orders. He was very friendly and made us laugh. Within a few minutes drinks and appetizers arrived, so all the kitchen staff we could see working fast really paid off. Zachary checked back many times, bringing us drinks, clearing plates, etc. A gal from kitchen brought our meals and they also came fast - yay! While we loved our appetizers of the wraps and the pot stickers, we really really loved our meals. I had the Chinese chicken salad and it was the best one I've ever had...for real! My husband had an amazing turkey sandwich with the most tasty roll -- very good he said. He also had the tortilla soup, which was amazing. Zachary and kitchen gal who brought food checked in many times and we stayed longer than planned because they were so awesome and we could relax in a great environment. They convinced us to try the red velvet cake and sure am glad they did. We were so full, so split a piece....even though it was a huge piece of cake and we were full..it was so good we had to eat all of it - ha!

304,Ramy J.,"Sacramento, United States",0,11,,5.0,2014-02-16,"We were looking for someplace good to eat after a few hours of gambling fun at Thunder Valley. It was Valentine's Day and 8:30pm. Called CPK and the host picked right up saying there was no wait for 2 people...yay. Arrived and found place busy but definitely a few tables open. I could tell that CPK planned for a busy night, I've never seen so many staff in the kitchen and so many servers/table clean up help as I did this night.  Very efficient operation being run here. We were seated and within a minute our server Zachary arrived at table to take drink and appetizer orders. He was very friendly and made us laugh. Within a few minutes drinks and appetizers arrived, so all the kitchen staff we could see working fast really paid off. Zachary checked back many times, bringing us drinks, clearing plates, etc. A gal from kitchen brought our meals and they also came fast - yay! While we loved our appetizers of the wraps and the pot stickers, we really really loved our meals. I had the Chinese chicken salad and it was the best one I've ever had...for real! My husband had an amazing turkey sandwich with the most tasty roll -- very good he said. He also had the tortilla soup, which was amazing. Zachary and kitchen gal who brought food checked in many times and we stayed longer than planned because they were so awesome and we could relax in a great environment. They convinced us to try the red velvet cake and sure am glad they did. We were so full, so split a piece....even though it was a huge piece of cake and we were full..it was so good we had to eat all of it - ha!

92,Sheena S.,"Roseville, CA",0,7,1.0,4.0,2014-05-02,"My husband and I have eaten here many times, but last night was quite exceptional. Our server, Gwen, was probably the best server we've ever had...in ANY restaurant we've dined it (and we've dined in many). I was in a fickle/indecisive mood to start with so it took us 30 minutes to even decide where to eat that night. But we landed here, and were excited about their new summer menu (strawberry salads, new refreshing drinks). We sat outside on their patio, and I started off with their new Rhubarb Martini drink that had orange, strawberry, and rhubarb root which I had never tasted before. The drink was nice and cold, refreshing, but immediately I could tell that I didn't care for the rhubarb taste-as it was similar to ginger for me. Gwen, our waitress could tell I didn't like it-and she was offering other options instead to replace that one. I said ""no no, it's fine""....I felt bad. I did like the sour taste of it, but just not the vegetable root taste ha. And she goes, well just sit with it awhile and if you still don't like it, I'll make you something else to try. I gave it a few more sips but just couldn't handle the Rhubarb so she threw out some other ideas, and I agreed to try a Plum martini. She was so sweet, kindly brought it out...but alas, was way too sweet for my liking. I ended up not drinking either, and she was so sweet about the whole thing and went above and beyond that any server would normally do. The caramelized peach salad I ordered was very tasty, especially with the gorgonzola cheese they use. I was expecting the peaches to be fresh, but I could tell they were from a can-so that was a bit disappointing. But other than that the salad was very good and perfect size (I ordered a half). Then we decided to go for their strawberry shortcake for dessert and I must say it was to die for. Fresh strawberries, with a strawberry glaze sauce, small little crystals of sugar sprinkled on top a house made biscuit/scone type thing. She also included vanilla ice cream for us with the whipped cream. It was really good. But above the food, I'm writing because this was our best experience (service wise)...really anywhere. Thank you Gwen! She was cheerful, helpful, gracious, and went above and beyond. CPK please give her a raise because she definitely deserves it. Any company would be very grateful to have an employee like her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=120,4.04,3.12,3.12,3.536,3.4880000000000004

I would hate for them to go out of business but after the service I had last night, I was not surprised to see why the restaurant was deserted on a Friday night. Our waiters name was Anthony, although when I first got there he was very nice and attentive, as the evening went- the service got progressively worse. I was absolutely embarrassed to bring my family to this restaurant. This guy had two tables and forgot to put in our drink order, probably forgot to put in our food order because it took FOREVER to get our food (all I got was a salad), and to top it all off it took him 20 minutes and me asking twice for him to bring us small plates for our food. The food was amazing, as always. I was just so stunned to see CPK so empty on a Friday and so saddened to have found out why. I wish only for the managers to take more of an initiative and make sure their servers are doing what they are suppose to be doing. Also there were four tables in the restaurant and I never saw the manager check on any of them (the table next to us seemed to have more problems than we did).

Our waiters name was Anthony, although when I first got there he was very nice and attentive, as the evening went- the service got progressively worse. I was absolutely embarrassed to bring my family to this restaurant. This guy had two tables and forgot to put in our drink order, probably forgot to put in our food order because it took FOREVER to get our food (all I got was a salad), and to top it all off it took him 20 minutes and me asking twice for him to bring us small plates for our food. The food was amazing, as always. I was just so stunned to see CPK so empty on a Friday and so saddened to have found out why. I wish only for the managers to take more of an initiative and make sure their servers are doing what they are suppose to be doing. Also there were four tables in the restaurant and I never saw the manager check on any of them (the table next to us seemed to have more problems than we did).

He liked the thickness of the pepperoni, the sweet tomato sauce and the cheesy cheese topping. I went for the barbecue chicken pizza but added the bacon which i regret as the smokey flavored pork overpowered the barbecue sauce. All in all... Twas a great meal served by a great waitor.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=80,3.16,3.55,3.55,3.3120000000000003,3.394

47,Jennifer S.,"Sacramento, CA",3358,493,984.0,3.0,2016-02-25,"We had the barbecue Hawaiian chicken pizza with bacon. The crust was quite bland and boring. It was honestly a bit on the small side for $17, and there were hardly any toppings on it. I mean there were maybe three pineapple bits on the whole thing. Still, it was enough that I wouldn't have been able to finish it by myself. I had the smaller half and was uncomfortably full, but I'm sure most guys would be able to polish it off pretty easily. I registered for their rewards program on my phone, so we got a free appetizer, and chose the corn guacamole and chips. It was really good, and it was pretty small, but the waitress had warned us that it was as small as it looked in the picture. It was probably like four tablespoons of guacamole and a large handful of corn tortilla chips for what would have been $5 (if it weren't free). The waitress was attentive and helpful. The food came out in a pretty reasonable amount of time, and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Based on this one pizza, I might have gone with two stars, but I've been here in the past many times and have always really liked their California Club pizza (which has avocado and bacon on it) and their avocado egg rolls. If memory serves, they also make a really good lemon drop. The tiramisu is good but not traditional. It's more like layers of vanilla cake and rum cake soaked in rum, with the whole thing covered with a rum mousse.

46,Shannon K.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,,5.0,2017-09-04,Went today for lunch with a friend and had another terrific experience. Our server was Trisha and she was excellent. Food was great and we both loved the Sangria. The Manager was out on the floor greeting and checking on customers as well as helping the servers. She was very outgoing and made you feel very valued as a customer. We love coming to CPK. I just felt today's experience warranted recognition for the server Trisha and the Manager who was very attentive to the restaurant's customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2?start=20,3.16,3.47,3.36,,3.346

Went for lunch this week had a great mushroom pasta dish, half order house salad, raspberry lemonade and a piece of key lime pie (yes a lot of calories lol) all of it was really really good! The pie was best key lime I've had, the bread they serve was soft and comes with olive oil. I can't wait to come back! The best part of the whole experience was our waitress, Julissa (I hope I spelled right), she was a really good waitress had our refill of drinks at our table before our 1st ones were gone, wasn't at our table every 5 minutes asking if we were ok like some do, was very sweet and helpful!

Not sure if this was to be her table. Dining by myself I had to get the attention of hostess as table next to me already started order..  Ordered water and carne asada pizza. Water came and sidebread to arrive fairly better pace. Bread was warm. Oil mixture with herbs was okay. Nothing spectacular.  Pizza didn't take long to arrive. Pizza nice crust pesto cilantro onion chile. A tomatillo type salsa sauce was provided but unneeded. It added a little bite. Carne was tender and well flavored. Elements separately were good. Together they worked cohesively.  Good was the pizza. I rarely order pizza here.  Bad was the mixed bag service.  Overall okay.

The pizza seemed smaller than usual, plus there were hardly any toppings on it. One little one inch piece of chicken on each slice and maybe one peanut. It was basically pizza dough slathered with the peanut sauce. Total rip off for $15. The BBQ pizza we got was only marginally better.  I should note that we bought through DoorDash and maybe because we weren't there in person, they thought we wouldn't care. Believe me, we care.

210,Cheryl B.,"Roseville, United States",88,236,80.0,3.0,2017-11-13,When we sat down for dinner we knew this was a busy night as it was Veteran's Day and they have a special menu for Vet's to enjoy for free. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower appetizer and 2 entrees plus 2 waters.  They separate the wait staff from the food runners so our food was brought by someone different that our waitress.  The appetizer came out and then she came by to see if everything was ok and that was the last we saw of her.  The entree came out not too much after ward which was great timing. all the tales were hopping and I understand but the table next to us were sat after us and for drinks and they were refilled several time and our waters were never refilled.  This became and issue as it was at least 30 minutes from when we finished until when our check was brought.  No water and we were not asked if we would like desert.  I guess if I bought lemonade like the table next door I would have gotten refills?  As we were in the corner by the bathroom no service staff came by to flag them down for help.  I almost got us and went to the hostess station to try and get out check.      I like the food here but I think it is overpriced. That reminded me why we rarely come here.  I would have loved to order an entree and a salad but they do not have a dinner salad and the half salads are almost $10.

204,Lene N.,"East Bay, United States",1432,853,4297.0,4.0,2018-01-01,"Things you need to order: 1) BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad - This salad is unique and is exactly what it means. Instead of a leafy style, the lettuce is chopped into fine squares, which makes it easier to eat- so easy you can eat it with a spoon since you can scoop with the salad. I also like this salad because it was the perfect amount of dressing. Along with chicken, this salad comes with tomatoes, beans, corn and tortilla chips and avocado (by the way this is extra $) but add it, because it adds great texture. Be sure to add Chillula hot sauce all over the salad, THIS really makes the salad delicious!  2) Tequila Lime Pasta - This Pasta Dish is my absolute favorite! It has a great kick with the tequila flavor cream sauce. With each bite, you have yummy chicken and bell peppers over a bed of al dente spinach pasta. Again, add Chillula over this baby, and boom- it's so delicious!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-roseville-2,3.52,3.48,3.448,,3.4960000000000004
