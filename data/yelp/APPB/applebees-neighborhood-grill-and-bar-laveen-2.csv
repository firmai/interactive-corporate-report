Joe D.,"Laveen Village, AZ",17,11,18,4.0,11/26/2017,Went there for Thanksgiving it was my third time there. It was clean and the staff was very friendly.

Amy B.,"Tolleson, AZ",12,28,14,4.0,11/28/2017,"First visit here, the service was great and the server Felicia was very friendly and attentive.  Tables and lobby were clean, but the ladies room could use some work.  The food came out in a timely fashion the way we ordered it.  I had the peppercorn steak with grains from the lighter fare menu and Ben had a 6 oz sirloin.  Mine didn't look exactly like the picture so I was worried, however it tasted wonderful and Felicia took the time to answer questions about the types of grains in the dish. I would definitely come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2
Aby G.,"LAVEEN, AZ",39,20,1,4.0,10/27/2017,This Applebees always has friendly staff.  The price is amazing with the $1 margaritas till the end oof the month and the half price appetizers.  The people and vibe in this Applebees is always upbeat and welcoming.  Two great appetizers to try are the boneless wings and the chicken wontons.

Carrie G.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,22,40,3.0,9/12/2017,"This was not my first visit here but this trip was annoying. I use carside service on most visits. I usually wait about 3-5 minutes before someone comes out but I can see them acknowledging my existence and getting my food. This time I sat for 10 minutes and saw no one checking outside (it's dark and my headlights shine right in the door). The manager even came out the carside door as I was getting out of my car and kept walking to the back of the building. Alrighty. After asking the hostess if carside service was available she went to ask about my food. The manager came back with it. Yes. The same one who saw me get out of my car. He told me my total, walked away with my card and offered no apology or acknowledgement that anything was wrong. I left angrier at the whole place and thinking that maybe I just don't understand how carside service is supposed to work. And my husbands chicken was dry when I got it home.  It's not that I'm lazy. I'm not. But if I'm not prepared to go into a restaurant, my attire might reflect those of pajamas and it's annoying to be put in that situation with no remorse from the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2
Francisco R.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2017,Went yesterday 10/21 with my family of seven and was expecting for there to be a wait time since we went on a Saturday and we were fine with that. The problem came when after 20 minutes or so another party of 6 comes in and they start complaining of wanting to be seated. The two greeters AND the manager  told them that my party was ahead of them and they would seat them in 20 minutes tops. After the other party kept complaining they got seated before my party. I then ask to speak to the same manager and ask him why this happened and I get told that he doesn't have an answer to that. By the time we got seated we had waited for over 40 minutes after the party that came after us got seated. Just a word of advice if you do decide to go here you should complain you will be seated a whole lot faster then if you are not a complainer like i was.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2
Becca N.,"Phoenix, AZ",54,414,33,3.0,4/25/2017,Not bad. Standard Applebees's sit down restaurant  and bar. Hostess didn't know any menu items really at all. Our server wasn't very talkative but kept our glasses full. Seat was freshly wiped when we were seated. No knives til we asked.

Erica M.,"Phoenix, AZ",220,35,21,2.0,10/11/2017,I'm giving this place a 2 star simply because if it wasn't for the server working the tables around the bar actually listening to me and helping me this place would get a zero. The bar tender sucks. She's not intuitive to all her customers. She defiantly has her regulars that she tends to more. But let's face it. Regulars around the ages of 21-25 don't tip well. She never asked me how my meal was but that one waiter has actually attended to me more by just walking around this u shape bar. I came in to eat dinner and drink a hot tatee cause I don't feel good and this is the service I receive. I'm an out of towner to. And get this she never carded me. I always get carded cause I look like I'm 20. Yeah so what I'm 30. I ALWAYS get carded. And this woman doesn't even know me. I even had to grab pepper off of another table. The no meat no chz salad that I ordered too was so ice cold. The plate was even ice. It hurt my teeth eating it. My mouth was frozen. I took only two bites and had brain freeze thereafter. After a long day of work to this. Sorry Applebee's get it together. Back home our Applebee's is the shit. This place has great servers but a damn horrible bartender. She will not be tipped for she didn't wait on me. Noah is getting my tip and should be the bar tender cause he is way more personable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2

Julie M.,"Glendale, AZ",46,24,31,2.0,4/24/2017,"This might have been a three if the entire experience matched up to the prices on their menu. But it doesn't. Applebee's is not an in expensive place to eat. They're fairly pricey. And for that high price our silverware Service included a single fork each and a single thin paper napkin each. Really Applebee's? You can't give me a knife fork and spoon? And more than one see-through napkin? I did ask for a knife and he did bring one but he wanted to know for each of us individually... really? And nice of you to have a catchup bottle on the table too bad it was empty and we had to walk halfway across the restaurant to get another one.  The food was OK. The service was OK. But I think it's unacceptable to pay $14 for fish and chips and then not get a full set of silverware, more than one napkin and a catchup bottle with catchup actually in it.  And really... Just keep my water glass full.  If we had depression era shortages I get it but you're charging an arm and a leg and I should not have to ask for every single scrap of anything in the restaurant....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2

Britt C.,"Phoenix, AZ",95,123,584,2.0,12/29/2015,"I have to admit. The commercials touting Applebee's new menu got me. I haven't been to an Applebee's for probably 10 years. But the commercials were intriguing. Had Applebee's really changed their menu to remain competitive with changing tastes & to compete with newer fast casual restaurants that aren't chains?  The answer is yes, but it's not impressive enough to turn the chain around. My date ordered a beer- IPA for him that was flat, and I got a glass of Cabernet (8oz for $6 and was decent) then we each had soup- French onion for me, chicken tortilla for him- and it came out piping hot and was delicious. By far best part of dinner. For our main course we both had steak- he got the 7oz sirloin with a baked potato and veggies, and I got the Shrimp & Parmesan sirloin. They came out warm, not hot. The cheese on the shrimp was a solid mess, not the melty kind indicated in menu picture. Garlic mashed potatoes were terrible- nothing garlic about them and also just warm with giant chunks of potatoes in them. My sirloin was actually good- soft and melted in my mouth. Not tough at all and cooked accurately according to the menu (pink all the way through, warm center). My date complained his steak was tough.  Service was just ok. We had to ask for silverware twice and wait to eat our main courses (maybe why it was warm?) until we got them. Server wasn't readily available, but we also didn't really need help that often.  If Applebee's wants to compete with other fast casual restaurants, they will need to represent their menu more accurately, work on faster food expediting, and evolve their wine and beer menu. Only 2 red wine choices? Most beers on tap were domestics- Bud, Coors, PBR, Miller Lite... Only one craft beer & it was flat.  Will we be back? I'm not sure. With so many other options, I'm willing to pay more for better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2

Megan S.,"Clarksville, TN",103,28,6,1.0,2/24/2016,"This is an understatement. I work in the industry and communication is key even when you don't want to tell your customers there is a wait.... Patchy service from our bartender but it's applebees they're always understaffed so there's usually only a bartender at any location.  My friend and I played their trivia games to keep us entertained because apparently conversations from your bartender is forbidden. Two other people had their food before us and sat down after us. Each complained about their food.  An hour after we ordered still sitting there becoming hangry I asked the bartender to just refund our food and we'd pay for our drinks. She seemed very frazzled and I don't blame her.  The bartender and manager apologized but the manager wanted to argue with me about why there was a wait.... Apparently their computer systems were down and there's no such thing as paper tickets or communication with back of house.

People work hard for their money to go out and do things and have a little fun! Not so it can be ruined with a bartenders poor attitude. Another thing is that I'm so disappointed with applebees come on be reason and respect your customers and at least pretend your worried about their safety. There was a drunk person at the bar harassing other people there all in their face and using racial slurs! When does the manager take charge and call authorities and remove this person? Oh wait they would have never don't that because they were too busy pouring the person drink after drink. I'm al for a good time but applebees needs to remember that there's crazy people in this world and a fight could have broken out or even worse. Very disappointed and never going back.

Jozie L.,"Buena Park, CA",569,301,334,4.0,7/2/2013,"I almost feel strange giving this Applebee's a favorable review. Judging from previous reviews local residents hate this place, but I feel compelled to be honest. We were in town visiting. Decided to have an early Saturday night dinner. Pleasant looking restaurant. Inside the air conditioning did catch our attention. 120 degrees outside contrasted sharply with near 70 degrees inside. Brr-rrr-rrrr . . . But that wasn't a negative. Didn't take long to get used to the frigid atmosphere. After a pleasant greeting we were seated and within minutes our server took drink orders. Lemonade and ice tea arrived right away. Received a new lemonade from our attentive waitress when my glass emptied. We ordered Steak and Shrimp combo, Won Ton Tacos and Lettuce Wedge topped with Green Goddess dressing sprinkled with toasted Pecan & Bacon bits. Tasty shrimp. Tough steak. Tacos and lettuce to die for. We'll order the noteworthy appetizers again and again. Nice flavor, fresh and light.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=20

Amanda J.,"Phoenix, AZ",37,38,22,1.0,8/4/2015,"I stopped eating at Apple Bees awhile ago not due to this location but due to other poor service and very poor food quality. I have seen lately that Apple Bees is trying to revamp and do more of a pub style menu which i think is good so my husband and i decided to give it another chance and see if it has improved...  Unfortunately everything about my dinner experience yesterday sucked..  First off the waitress was like a walking zombie, NO Personality what so ever. Didnt greet us, didnt tell us any thing about new items on the menu. Not a single smile. She CLEARLY wanted to be anywhere but work and we were obviously a huge inconvience to her evening... It made us feel very uncomfortable.  My chicken was over cooked and dry as a bone! I asked for ranch three times before the waitress remembered to bring it. My husband ordered a margarita and it came in a martini glass.. With an olive?.. It was strange and his burger was over cooked and flavorless.. Overall I was disappointed..

None of us were driving as we had previously arranged for rides home and we explained that to the 'I've only been here 72 hours' new manager from Maine. Before he cut us off he came to our table introduced himself, shook our hands, and chatted with us regarding establishments being liable for serving patrons too much. We totally agreed and explained that's why all 3 of us were drop off and will be picked up at the end of the evening.  Long and short been there and received horrible service many times before so I would give them 6 months before returning and see if the improved but I think this  was it for me.

Jeff B.,"Phoenix, AZ",39,328,174,4.0,7/10/2014,"First time at this Applebee's. Had trepidation about the service, based on previous reviews. Service was just fine, with quick seating, friendly greeting and just the right amount of attention.  My wife ordered the Seasonal Berry and Spinach Salad and wine while I had the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders and a Strawberry Lemonade.  The salad was fresh and light but they forgot the pecans. My wife always likes crunch with her salads, so that was a key missing piece for her.  My entree was tasty but needed help. The cheese sauce was so thin that it didn't cling to the pasta. Also the chicken was SO sweet that the flavor of the chicken (and pasta) got lost. The breadstick was a nice touch, as it was very similar to the mouth watering Olive Garden bread. Not a bad meal, just needed some tweaking to the recipe.

April V.,"Phoenix, AZ",67,55,31,1.0,2/6/2015,"Typically I have have always had a mediocre experience at this Applebees. This time however was probably the worst I have experience so far. I do not expect much out of this location however anything worse then my typical experience is unacceptable.  Wait time: anytime I go it's usually between 5 and 6 so the wait time is usually always around 15 minutes. This time the wait time was the same but the greeter didn't even greet me with a Hello welcome to Applebees.  Instead I had to go up to her and ask her to put my name down. Waitress: After being seated we didn't see our waitress for another 10 minutes.  This means we didn't even order our drinks yet. Finally when she made an appearance we gave her our drink order, ice tea and sprite. Took another 10 minutes.  Food: I get the same thing every time, steak and veggies. My 6 year old daughter got the 4 ounce steak from the kids menu. Medium rare for both of us. Took about 15 mins to get our food which was typical... but this time my steak looked like one of those processed steaks. Like the kind you buy in the bag at the grocery store precooked. It was done med well. My daughters 4 ounce steak, which looked like a small hockey puck,  was rarer than mine.  My steak tasted funny, I couldn't even finish it all. And it comes with seasonal veggies which happens to be broccoli,  ALL YEAR ROUND.  Half way through eating I was done with my ice tea awaiting a refill that never came. When we were done eating we waited for about another 15 mins for our waiting who I had not seen for at least 25 mins prior. I had to ask the buss boy to get her for me. My daughter really wanted desert and it was out date night so I agreed even though I just wanted to leave at this point. When our waitress finally came around I gave her the order we got the dessert soon after, and then we did some more for her to come back around so we could get the check. 10 minutes goes by again and she finally chose her face and asked if we want the check.  I did overhear her talking with the table behind us saying that she only started about a week ago, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to she was new. I still gave her a $5 tip on a 30 dollar bill only because of this reason. All in all I do not think I will go to this location again not so much because of the experience I had with the waitress but more on the food was less than mediocre this time and I couldn't even finish it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=40

Kyle B.,"Phoenix, AZ",127,26,6,1.0,1/19/2013,"Local residents in a small town 30 minutes south west of downtown Phoenix are ecstatic about the new changes that have been taking place at their local Applebee's in Laveen, Arizona. Super Official News stopped by the restaurant this weekend to investigate further what's making this hot spot so popular. Restaurant manager Paul Horner explained just a few of the exciting changes that have been happening. ""Every Friday and Saturday while we have our live Jimmy Buffet tribute band or gangster rap playing at full volume over the speakers from 3pm-2am, during breaks in the music, I've been letting my 8-year old son bang on his drum set that I just bought him for his birthday last month,"" Horner said. ""We also just got two new microwaves to cook all the food that is on the menu. We named them 'Chef 1 and 'Chef 2, Horner laughs. ""Preparing your steak how you want it will now be easier than ever! We also changed out the drainage system around the bar area so it doesn't smell like urine and human feces as much anymore."" Local resident Michael Spielman says he just loves the new changes at the Applebee's in Laveen. ""They repaved the parking lot and I even heard they added new insulation to the roof of the building. Also, they have installed new air conditioning vents above every table that blow out the coldest air you've ever felt in your entire life. It's like traveling to Antarctica, but you're actually in Laveen! How cool is that, no pun intended,"" Spielman laughs. ""Also I noticed there is more free mints and toothpicks when I walk in. Rip-roaring good times have come to Laveen!"" Gerald Byrnes who has been a server since the restaurant opened two years ago gave us some inside information on the appetizers and beverages. ""No longer will our cold rubbery cheese sticks and alcoholic beverages that have no alcohol in them take an hour to arrive at your table. We have cut all our times down to 50 minutes or less or you get another alcoholic beverage with no alcohol in it free of charge! How awesome is that!"" Horner was more than happy to explain their new menus and additional usages. ""Instead of 7-9 different menus per person we are now giving each diner 19 different menus of various sizes and colors to browse through. It will all be the same food but now just more spread out to make things more fun,"" Horner said. ""Also to keep our customers safe, we are upgrading the menus to a type of plastic recently invented by NASA that has corners that can cut through glass. If the need ever comes up to fight off an attacker, our menus will work better than a machete."" Assistant manager Joyce Barth explained some of the other exciting new changes that have been made to improve the restaurant. ""Our greeters and servers will no longer speak urban slang and other forms of language that make it difficult to understand when trying to order food,"" Barth says. ""We have put each and every one of our employees through a rigorous 36-week course on how to properly speak to a customer in a language that can be understood by both the young and old."" Barth continued, ""When greeted at the front, no longer will you hear the familiar shouting of, 'Oh lawd, it's you folks again! Well git on in here and I'll get your seats right now! Not sure what's good right now for sitting, lemme check real quick for yall. You hang tight and chill, I be back after I git this figured out. I'll hit up my girlfriend Yolanda, she's one of the dish washers but she always has the down low on seats that aren't already taken up by some other fools'. This will now be replaced by, 'Hello and welcome to Applebee's. Would you like a table or a booth?'"" Horner told Super Official News that because of all these great new changes at his restaurant, unfortunately there will come sacrifices. ""In addition to raising prices on all of our food* because of Obamacare and firing employees so we don't have to provide them with health care, we will also be forced to raise prices to cover all the costs of these new and exciting changes. But I think everyone in Laveen will agree that it's worth it the next time they come in for lunch or dinner or just to get a drink with no alcohol in it."" From Applebee's in Laveen to your family: We know in Laveen you have no options for good food so when you're starving, and you have no food left in your house and the grocery stores are closed, head on over to Applebee's. We'll make sure you have the worst f*cking dining experience ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=60

Appetizer = Microwaved buffalo wings that had turned cold again, served with old cheese stuck to the plate, when cheese doesn't come with the wings. Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp = Chicken tasted like salmon, shrimp was cold, and the mushrooms tasted like they skipped the cleaning process. We had 2 bites to eat and decided to ask for the check, waitress asked if we wanted boxes..... We quickly said no, she showed no concern to ask about if anything was wrong with our food, said okay and brought back the check. Put the check on the table and walked off, not a word. Came back and grabbed check with payment, not a word. Brought receipt for signature, not a word. Since she cared about our food and experience, I showed the same respect in her tip. We left, not a word more than I wrote on the receipt telling them to step their game up. We are not going to be going back to this Applebee's...

Asked to get a comment card and manager got defensive and accusatory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
H K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,45,12,1.0,7/18/2012,"Yuck, this place is gross. Not only is the food sub-par, cold, and flavorless.. it turns into a rauchy ""club"" on some nights. I don't know if all Applebee's are trying to do that or if it's just a horrid decision from this one, but I'll never go back. I wish it would shut down and a Chili's built in it's wake. If I'm gonna have chain food I at least want it to taste consistently good and NO nasty skanky ""club"" nights. *gag*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
Luke S.,"Laveen, AZ",8,56,12,5.0,5/26/2012,"I have gotten take out service a few times, the latest this weekend, and everything has been great. Food order was correct and warm, server was professional. No complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
Cupcake M.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,57,25,2.0,1/27/2013,"Exactly, Meh, I've experienced better. I really try to avoid negative reviews, but this one was needed. Your sit down choices in Laveen are limited to Native New Yorker, a handful of Mexican dives, and of course the local Applebee's (hurry up Barros Pizza!) Twice we ordered curbside and twice they got it wrong. Both times portions of the meal were missing, not only did we wait 10 more minutes than promised, we waited 10 more minutes for the missing food! Also disappointed potato skins were taken off menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
David L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,25,,3.0,10/17/2014,"I was a bit worried to go to this location because of the other reviews about the slow and bad service. The service was fine and timely.

Melinda H.,"Laveen, AZ",77,75,73,4.0,4/14/2012,"I go there most Friday nights with my husband.  We always sit at the bar.  Everyone is very friendly, and you never have to wait very long for your food or for drinks.  We take people when they come in for out of town, and they cannot believe how friendly all the waiters and bar staff are.  The downside, sometimes the welcome staff are not that friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
Sophia C.,"Vista, CA",76,31,65,2.0,1/25/2012,"So I'm sure everyone has been to an Applebees in their lifetime. This particular location has terrible customer service! I've been there a few times hoping their customer service improves and only because it is a close location to where I live and for their happy hour. When you walk in you normally have to eye down the hosts or waiters to know that you are there waiting. Rarely is there anyone greeting you. They take a while with their food even when it's not busy, and their food is typically really salty. I wouldn't recommend this location, only if you're desperate for some cheap drinks during happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80

Janine M.,"Glendora, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/8/2013,"I just left and man the server was so horrible!  I don't want to be mean or rude but I find when I have older server's they don't ""hear"" you good. I came to relax and enjoy a nice margarita with my meal. Ugh! I eas seated server took ten mins I gave her my order and waited another 15 mins for my appetizer to come still no drink ::Sigh:: couple min later drink comes..and eww the glass was sticky and dirty I had to pour my drink in the martini glass? Ok?  Serving a margarita in a martini glass?! Whatever .. let it slide.. then I'm sipping and then I swallowed something strange.. I called the server over she doesn't even seem to care nor believe I swallowed a strange object that was in the glass I had to ask her to bring me a new drink with a CLEAN glass.. another couple mins ..new drink. Glass is still dirty I had to wipe myself!  And its already been 40 mins no food call over the manager explains what happens. . Dude pulls server she didn't ""hear"" my entree... great! At this point I lost my cool i just decided to pay for the lousy margatini lol whatever that thing was and my appetizer . At least the manager just told me it was no charge for it. I would avoid going here lol I should of went to like native new yorker or chipolte.

Pebbles C.,"Waimanalo, HI",38,8,3,2.0,2/29/2012,Service wasn't great and very slow.  I ordered a simple plate of steak and potatoes. The steak was over cooked and dry.

Christina S.,"Tolleson, AZ",0,9,,1.0,7/25/2014,The reviews are on point! By far the WORST Applebee's experience EVER!! I did read the reviews but the place was recommended by a friend so I thought I'd give it a try. We got seated fairly quickly so I was hopeful but I realized it's because nobody comes here. I've never been to an Applebee's happy hour that was dead.  I waited over 5 minutes for beer and had to remind the server that I ordered it.Appetizers  were not brought out at the same time. Our friends got their wings before us. Not to mention they totally forgot about our Mozzarella sticks. Had to remind the server about those after our meals were brought out. Which also weren't brought out at the same time. The food was bleh. Waited over an hour for a sandwich!  There was no silverware on the table so when we asked for silverware the server said the had no rolled silverware. She threw napkins & silverware on table. Really? They couldn't have rolled the silverware? It's not like it was busy. I waited so long for my second beer that I actually had to go to the bar to ask for it. By far hands down the worst Applebee's experience ever! Do not waste you $ on this poor establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
Alex S.,"Surprise, AZ",1,11,4,1.0,10/6/2010,"i went to this place on Saturday night and the two ghetto hostesses  literally had their heads down on the front desk. I had to ask them if they were open and they responded rudely then stared at me as if they didn't know what I wanted. I finally requested that I have a seat and I sat waiting for several minutes when I saw the waiter who looked like he was either high or very tired and not interested in working there. After I saw the first 3 employees, I decided that I was going to leave. I will never ever ever go to that Applebees.  It seemed like the place didn't have a manager on duty. Avoid this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
Marina D.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,1,,4.0,5/1/2015,"I normally don't write reviews but this is something that is unacceptable. I saw that there were two new managers I asked where Rafael and Shavonda were because I normally talk to them in delight (my family eats regularly here) and I liked the new manager, the tall man, I think his name was Leon. But anyways the other one was a short Latina lady, and man was she rude, her name starts with a B or something. I saw her yell at an employee not once but TWICE on different occasions. She looks like she tries to please customers which is good but... it is UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISGUSTING to chew someone out in front of paying customers. She had a terrible attitude with them from what I could hear. I can't believe that a person would humiliate a server on the resteraunt floor. I've had years of experience as a manager at different food chains and I can say that seeing that was truly sad. I love Applebee's but I just had to write about it, I hope that they don't condone that behaviour in the future with her. Anyways great food and great music.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
Cher T.,"Tempe, AZ",310,166,72,2.0,8/21/2008,"I'm sorry to give this place two stars, but seriously - I HAVE experienced better.  Growing up in Laveen, where there has never been anything but dairies and fields between my house and south Phoenix. To have four lane roads and stop lights is freakin' psycho to me!! Oh my gosh! Besides my Laveen novelty of the whole idea of having an actual resturant in our lil hick town... I do like Applebee's. You can see me there - very late at night chilling with my friends talking about God knows what enjoying appetizers and refillable sodas. Their drinks aren't anything to write home about - seriously, chili's get it better. Their appetizers aren't as weird as Chili's so I'm glad. Their decor isn't great - come on... I say Applebee's you know what I mean.  But what this place DOES have going for it is it's waitstaff. They are always friendly, quick and occasionally funny. I like their staff but once in a while they have odd lil grabass competitions that I have personally shouted at them to stop. Once they didn't quit and I complained and scored a free meal! (whoo!)  I think it's a nice place, but honestly - it's just your average Applebee's but trust me, there are some Applebee's where the servers are jerks, Thank goodness - this place isn't like that!! Hope to see you there! -Cher",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=80
Angela E.,"Mackinaw, IL",6,20,5,4.0,11/8/2010,My husband and I have been here twice since moving to Laveen in July 2010.  Both times we had good waitstaff and both times we happened to arrive during the early evening happy hour and ordered 1/2 price drinks and appetizers.  The food and drinks were both good.  This is a typical Applebee's but unlike several of the past reviewers we have yet to experience bad service here.  We would probably come here more during the 1/2 price timeframes but we like to try to experience more local restaurants too.  We will definitely be making more trips here in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-laveen-2?start=100
