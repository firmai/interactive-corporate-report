Josephine M.,"Toledo, OH",11,17,21,5.0,7/22/2017,"I love this place. The food is always hot and fresh. I also love if you don't want to sit in you can order online and pick it up, that's very convenient for me. I have had a number of things here, but my favorite is the shrimp and chicken pasta. I love the sauce, the peppers and the general thickness of the dish. The chicken is cooked just right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo
Tori A.,"Holgate, OH",39,65,52,3.0,1/29/2017,"Slow slow slow service. Everything just seemed like it was in slow motion. We got the potato skins and jalapeño poppers for an app. Potato skins are just meh. Dry, overcooked... comes with ranch? I would have rather had a sour cream. Ranch just seems weird. I had the jack daniel's chicken with mashed potatoes and tomato mozzarella salad and I had 0 complaints. It was very good. My boyfriend's $26 steak and shrimp.... well, the shrimp was good. Steak was just meh. For $26, at least. My dad had a steak too, also meh. Their Mac & cheese was bland. Nothing came out hot, lukewarm at best. And make sure to read the ""free appetizer"" fine print. Because the value is only up to $8. We ended up spending around $156, $11 of that was on alcohol, and that was AFTER our $8 had already been knocked off. Overall, I don't think the food was worth that kind of price. Upon seeing that the potato skins are actually served with ""green onions sour cream"" I would just like to say, it tasted like ranch. I didn't like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo
Steve Z.,"Sylvania, OH",0,6,,2.0,1/22/2017,"I went there Jan 16 about 6:30 PM along with my Sister and Brother in Law.  The pretzel appetizer was very good. My burger was only slightly warm when delivered to me. It was also kind of dry. The flavor was okay and it seemed like a good cut of meat. My sweet potato fries were good but not exceptional and again, not hot.  Overall, my meal was okay, but not exactly the kind of meal that's going to make me hurry back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo
Kelly R.,"Sylvania, OH",1,19,4,1.0,5/15/2017,"I have only been here one time until my second visit the other night. I was very excited to enjoy a meal with my family.  Unfortunately I did not expect the meal to take over two hours, our salads be made with items missing including ANY dressing and the waitress to just disappear into thin air after bringing the meals.  She did not come back. No water. No refills. No dressing. Nothing.  She was nowhere to be found.  We waved down a host and said ""excuse me, our salads are missing dressing."" To which his response was ""I'll tell your waitress.""  Ten minutes passed and no one came.   We saw the host again ""excuse me we're missing dressing"" and he very annoyed said ""yea! I told your waitress!"" Complete with an eye roll. Then he walked away.  Twenty minutes passed and a manager asked how our meal was.  We explained....after our food had been sitting for thirty minutes.  She finally brought us dressing.  The manager also got us refills and offered to bring us the other missing items for our salad. Much later, our waitress came back to give us the check and explained she is pregnant and getting over the stomach flu.  Ummmmm.  I can relate to the morning sickness but the stomach flu? We do not want to know you were just hospitalized with excessive vomiting when you are handling our food!   The table behind us, also with little kids, sat with their menus for the entire time we waited on our dressing and they didn't even get to order until after we got our check.   This was ridiculous.   Here are the errors to help the front of the house do better next time: Teach your host to go grab something from kitchen and help a waitress and a customer out.  Teach your host to refrain from getting an ATTITUDE with customers.   The restaurant was NOT busy...so teach your other waitstaff to keep an eye out and help out another section instead of standing around talking.  If you're a waitress and feeling unwell, tell your manager so she can adjust your area or help you while you are off the floor.  If you are a manager and know your staff is not taking care of their tables, go assess the situation and take care of it preferably before the chicken on their salad is cold and their children have lost patience after the VERY VERY VERY long time they have been there...waiting.   I was amazed that the manager did not offer to comp any part of our meal....or offer a dessert...nothing!  I'm not one to ask for things for free but when we've told you we've had the food without dressing for over a half hour? Because the visit was so long our kids were at the end and we had to leave.  We didn't even get to enjoy a meal.     I made the WRONG choice to go there the other night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo
Douglas C.,"Sylvania, OH",36,4,5,2.0,5/1/2017,"Basic chain restaurant. Food was ok, nothing special or exciting.

Meagan M.,"Maumee, OH",0,18,9,1.0,9/17/2016,"Decided to give Friday's another shot for lunch a few weeks ago, never again. Maybe one night for drinks and appetizers, but I will never come here when there is a time constraint.  First, we stopped in on a Friday afternoon for lunch. Three people total, all wearing the same shirt. Pretty easy to identify that we are on our break. Two people in the party ordered a beer that was on special and pointed to the menu when choosing this particular special. Got our drinks, food was ordered, we were looking really good on time. And then we waited, and waited, and waited. Others came in, ate, and left in the time we waited. Two burgers and a chicken sandwich took 45 minutes. It was too late, our hour was up and we stuffed our faces and notified our coworkers that we would return shortly.  Then came home for the checks. Again, three people all wearing the same shirt, could you please separate the checks? She finally figured that out (sort of) and we decided just to figure out what she messed up on when we got back to work. But wait, remember that special priced beer that I mentioned? Oh no, we got charged regular price for those which was around $6 and the special was $4. No, $2 is not going to break me, but it was the way she handled it that really pissed me off. She said ""I asked if you wanted the tall and you said yes"". I told her that I pointed to the special and told her that was what we ordered and she said ""well, you drank the one that I gave you so you're paying for it"".  I wasn't asking for a free beer, just to pay the price that I ordered. Her attitude towards it was ridiculous.  Never again for lunch Fridays, never again. And truthfully I'm only going back to use the gift card that management sent me for the rude service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo
Nic W.,"Adrian, MI",32,45,178,4.0,7/12/2016,We eat here on a regular basis.  We have always been greeted quickly and the host is always friendly and helpful.  The waiting area has plenty of seating. There are several seating areas for large groups. Along with a bar area off to the side. There are tv's in the bar area but not in the dinning room. There is wait times often during the weekend. But I have not waited longer then 45 min on a Saturday night. After being seated the wait staff has greeted us promptly and I don't remember a time they have not advised us of the drink specials. The do have $4.00  drink specials and $3 beer specials. There long islands are good. This time as many in the past the food arrived in a timely fashion. Food was as expected and tasted well. My pop never went empty and that's a bid deal for me.  The dining area was clean and tables were cleaned promptly after dinners were done. We were sat on the Far East side and it was a little cold and I enjoy the air conditioning. The waitress got us our bill and we checked out as expected but not with out being told about their deserts.  We often get their pretzels for an appetizer Andy the combination with the cheese dip is awesome. Their Jack Daniels chicken is awesome. I have also had their boneless wings as well. Prices are average to high for an establishments  similar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo
Lisa J.,"Toledo, OH",0,5,,1.0,10/28/2017,"Had a very bad experience with an online order. My email confirmation said to bring in the credit card you paid with online, which I did.  After driving 20 miles since I leave in a rural area and it was raining, I ordered 40 mins. prior to arriving. When I got there I waited 20 mins. then they demanded my ID in addition to my credit card even though I watched several people check-out with credit and were not asked for ID. I told the girl it's raining, it's in my car and I've been waiting, I already paid for this and brought my card in as the confirmation instructed. I told them to forget it!  I went got my ID went to the manager Chelsea and asked for my money back. She never really said anything except it could take several days and to call her if I don't get my money back in 4  days. I ask her for a receipt, then waited another 10 mins. She came back and handed me the original receipt not one showing a credit. If a credit was issued it always shows as a pending transaction at my bank, I checked my bank the following day and nothing.  Chelsea didn't even offer an apology. I will be following up with a general manager at their corporate office.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo

We went in on Wednesday evening, we were sat in a table with a broken chair that my son fell from several times because it was so wobbly and if he moved even to reach his drink the chair would cause him to fall to the floor..

Stewart J.,"Toledo, OH",3,19,2,2.0,1/20/2016,"Sat down at the bar tonight for a drink and food.  The bartender ignored me for ten minutes. When she finally came over she asked me how I was doing, then walked away.  After a couple of minutes, she finally came back again, so I ordered my drink. I then ordered the Bruschetta chicken. It took a long time arriving. The food was wonderful, though. The chicken was a little under-done for me, but I like mine dry, so it would be perfect for everyone else. Long story short, poor service good food, moderately high prices. Ps.

Amanda W.,"Toledo, OH",0,9,1,2.0,7/7/2013,"We went into Friday's recently, and overall, my family and I were underwhelmed by the experience. Half the table got their food before the other half, so by the time the rest of the table's food came, the first half was already half done eating. The portion sizes were also incredibly small for the price. We went in for dinner, but the portions seemed smaller than they would even be for lunch. The food itself was just okay. Nothing amazing about it, and nothing I would go back for myself. Everything we had could be easily found other places, and done better at that. The service was good enough. The waitress checked in enough, but none of the staff we encountered were very friendly. They all gave off the vibe that they were fed up with even the smallest of things. A complaint was made about something we ordered and we were treated as if we made up what the problem was. I understand working in a restaurant can be a pain, but acting inconvenienced by the customers is not going to help. Overall, I will probably not be going back. There are better places in town to eat, and I've had better experiences. Not to mention everyone ended up getting sick shortly after leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo?start=20

The food at this place is not bad tasting...but everything is literally cooked in butter. I've probably eaten potstickers from over fifty different locations, but Friday's is the only place I know that pan fries their potstickers in butter. Every component of my entree ( flounder, vegetables and rice) were also cooked in butter.  I don't know if I'll go back.

Carolyn E.,"Delaware, OH",28,185,202,4.0,10/16/2011,"Wow, how many different ""feels"" has this place had over the years?  I remember it used to have a ""Venetian"" feel when I was little...  Whatever the case, the current incarnation is surprisingly good.  The ambience itself hasn't changed, but the upscale additions to the menu make it one of the most interesting restaurants to go to right now, and most eclectic.   I think the best way to describe the current menu at Fridays' is ""fusion"".  They have a bit of everything - Asian marinades, Greek-ish pastas, Chinese tinged chicken, the signature Jack Daniels BBQ, standard burgers and sandwiches, and even some seafood that would give Red Lobster a run for their money.   It's the sort of place you could take the entire family, and even the pickiest eaters would find something they like. My personal favorite is the bruschetta chicken pasta, ridiculously flavorful with its thin slivers of garlic, bites of tomato, and juicy grilled chicken.  However, the lemon-caper pasta dish I had on my last visit was also a major win - I loved the tart bite of the lemon and zing from the capers.  I could see some people might find it a bit overpowering, though. Potstickers are the go-to appetizer for my family.  They are very juicy and tender, and accompanied by a flavorful soy-based sauce that you will want to put on other things once you are out of potstickers.   Of course, you can get a free appetizer of sorts if you join the Stripes club - showing your Stripes card gets you a small but sharable platter of chips and salsa.   Also, definitely save room for dessert!  They are all amazing.  My personal favorite (and the longest lasting, I think) is the brownie oblivion - so undercooked it's almost brownie batter, and dripping with ghiradelli fudge and caramel, it's so ridiculously rich you will need to split it with two or three people.   Friday's also has an amazing drink menu, and is one of the few places I sometimes partake.  I could not do so on my last few visits though as I was driving, so I cannot make any recent suggestions. Prices are about what you expect for this sort of restaurant.  Most meals cost you at least $10.  However, in recent years, Friday has instituted a series of deals - 3 for $16, 2 for $10, etc.   For instance, for the 2 for $10, you get an entree and appetizer or dessert for just $10.  If you bring a friend, one of you can get the appetizer, the other dessert, and thus you get a full meal for just $20.  The choices are much more limited on these deals, to be sure, but there are still plenty of tasty things to choose from.  Anyways, this particular location has always been above average.  Good to great service, decent decor that has a lively atmosphere without being too loud, and lots of interesting knickknacks and images on the walls.  It is a bit dark in some sections of the restaurant so if you have trouble seeing you might want to bring reading glasses.  Overall, in its current incarnation, it is once again a family favorite, and we will definitely keep coming back.  Be sure to check it out for a night out with friends, or a fun place for the family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toledo?start=20

Bryan R.,"Sylvania, OH",24,9,1,1.0,5/19/2014,"Went to TGI Fridays on Saturday.  After a 20 minute wait we were seated. I ordered the Bruscetta appetizer which in all honesty was pretty delicious.  Unfortunately there was only 4 little tiny breads but to be fair the appetizer was only 5.00. I had chips and salsa while I waited. The salsa was ok but the chips were tougher than roof shingles. I ordered the burger with braised beef cheese and sauté d onions which sounded delicious. I asked the waiter to bring the burger out cooked medium but he said he was not allowed to do so and promised me a juicy burger. When I received the burger it was hot and at first glance plated rather nicely. It looked like a burger, and smelled like a burger, but literally tasted of nothing. There was no seasonings such as salt, or any sauce at all. It was a dry flavorless hot mess. Not to mention there were these giant chunks of black char off the grill all up in my burger. The burger was disgusting and the fried was loaded with salt but at least they had a discernable flavor.

F Z.,"Columbus, OH",510,372,442,3.0,12/7/2008,"TGIFriday's is one of the few chains that I can actually tolerate. Menu specials change seasonally, which can be good or bad. My all-time favorite white chocolate mousse dessert was yanked from the menu, much to my dismay. Needless to say, the list of desserts isn't too stellar these days. Ice cream sundae? Brownie? ZzZzZz.... Appetizers are a hit or miss. BBQ pork ravioli bites and Green Bean Fries dipped in cucumber wasabi ranch dip doesn't really spell appetizing. Or at least not to me, it doesn't.  Thankfully, traditional entree favorites are still offered. Read: the entire Jack Daniel's section. The so-called ""right portion right price"" menu is surprisingly quite appealing and tasty (*cough*unlike Applebee's*cough*.) In all honesty, it's hard to NOT like TGIF. There's something on the menu for everyone -- if not the food, then definitely the atmosphere.
