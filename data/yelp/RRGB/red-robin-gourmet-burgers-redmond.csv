Stephanie B.,"Pasco, WA",60,7,,1.0,9/7/2017,"We were traveling through and stopped for lunch on Labor Day.  The bar side was not busy, so we sat down at an empty table.  We were not acknowledged when we walked into the restaurant (which we know, from previous experience with Red Robin employees at other locations, they are expected to greet all guests when they come in AND when they leave).  The server in the bar did not acknowledge us for at least 8 minutes (and even then, only when we flagged her down).  It took her quite awhile to come and get our orders, and even longer to get our food (it was at least 20 minutes from the time we ordered, to the time we got our food, and we were there AFTER the lunch rush).  Even then, both of our burgers were wrong.  We didn't bother to send them back since we'd been waiting for quite awhile by that point.  When we left, we were not greeted on the way out.

Kish V.,"Bellevue, WA",0,3,,1.0,10/28/2017,"We've visited this restaurant just today and had a very worst experience. My wife and I being vegetarians ordered for NachOMG (Nachos) without chilli. Waitress named ""Vasi"" has served nachos WITH chilli. My wife was eating them and suddenly when I looked at her plate and realized there was chilli on the nachos. When I confronted the waitress she was very rude and said ""OK I didn't check"". It may not matter to these kind of stupid waitresses but for people having emotions about not eating meat will definitely get hurt. I'll never go to this restaurant again and encourage my friends and family to not go here as well.

Catherine M.,"Brier, WA",282,146,236,5.0,8/3/2016,"One red robin = all red robins. Red robin was one of my favorite restaurants as a kid. Just a dream for the picky eater who wants kiddie food like plain cheeseburgers fries milkshakes and crayons. Red robin hits the same spot for me as an adult, and there are more complex choices im realizing as far as the ""Gourmet"" burgers go.  There really aren't any flaws with red robin- they've got it down. Your wants and needs will be met always, if not on the first try then on the second. Red robin is reliably good no matter the location. Red robin. I don't eat beef hardly ever, but as far as chicken burgers go, red robin burgers are just as good if not better than competitors. I think they're really yum. And the red robin steak fries are so nice simply because of that magical seasoning and the wide scope of dipping sauces, with new ones popping up all the time- garlic aoli, sweet Thai.  We ate in the bar a few nights ago, the bartender was sweet! Liked him. Left red robin full and happy.

Mimi N.,"Seattle, WA",681,434,2259,4.0,11/19/2016,"It always fill my heart with joy whenever I encountered nice service. For this particular visit, our server did an outstanding job. Swung by here for a quick dinner and surprisingly, at 5pm ish, there were plenty of seats out in the restaurant and in the bar. For the bar, it was open seating. My friend and I sat in the bar and overall, both of us had a pleasant time here. For food, we ordered: the pub mac and cheese, the bees kness (aka chicken and waffle sandwich), strawberry freckled lemonade, and some cheesy/spicy fries (forgot the name). For the fries appetizer, it was like eating a mini nachos with fries instead of chip. Loaded with a ton of cheese, bacon and some Jalapenos, this will definitely fulfill any immediate hunger you may have.  As for the mac and cheese, this dish was alright. It's cheesy but nothing too outstanding. As for the bees knees, the waffle is done Belgian style where it's super sweeeet. Combined with waffle with a slab of crispy chicken and bam! A mini sandwich awaits you. Personally, I found the dish to be too much for me but it was fun to try something different on the RR menu. For service, our server was on point. From delivering re-fills of our drinks without us asking to making sure everything went alright, I really do appreciate our server's effort in making this a pleasant dining experience.  This is definitely one of the best RR places I have been to in a long while :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond

Brandi R.,"Seattle, WA",0,15,6,2.0,10/1/2017,"I ordered via phone for a to go order.  I was told 17 minutes - okay no big deal.   I went in about 15 minutes.   First of all, I get that they want to get the to go orders out as quickly as possible.   However, who thought it would be a great idea to have the pick up table right in front of doors that open and close.  How is the food going to stay hot (even in ""hot boxes"") sitting there as people walk in and out - especially with winter coming?  There are food handling rules about temperatures for food. Anyway, I'm standing there for a good 3 or 4 minutes as the dude behind the counter looks at me a few times but doesn't say anything.  He helps 2 gentlemen who weren't there when I walked in and another gentlemen who was there.   As he's running around another lady asks if I've been helped and when I reply no, she says the dude (who was behind the counter) was getting all the to go food from the kitchen.   I wait around another 3-4 minutes as he helps everyone else but me.   Finally, he asks me if I was (not my name).  I say no and that lady walks in and picks up her food.   Then I give him my name, and my food was literally sitting there the whole time.    So, already being irritated, I mention that it has been sitting there since before I walked in to start and how is it going to remain hot if its been sitting out?  He gets flustered and I guess the manager heard and walked over.  They asked if I wanted it remade, but I had already been there at least 10 minutes by that point.  The manager tried to give me the  - its in a hot box - argument.....which sure it was.  It was also sitting right near doors that open and close every time someone walks in and out.  I decided to take the food because honestly I didn't have the time to wait around. It wasn't very hot and it wasn't very good - along with their updated ""look"" came a distinct lack of customer service and intelligent food handling knowledge.   The manager did not know how long it had been sitting there......sigh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond

Pawares P.,"Bellevue, WA",172,85,151,3.0,1/29/2016,"I have never been a big fan of Red Robin's burgers.  I don't know why, but I just can't really enjoy their burgers as much as other gourmet burger places.  I don't feel like their patties are as good in quality and flavor, and even when they ask you for how would you like the patties to be cooked, they can never make it right.  Everything is almost always well done..  And how does the overcooked patties taste like??  Way too dry and lack of flavor!   Well, that was for the burgers.. Other than that, Red Robin has really delicious fries, which is usually unlimited when you order with the entree.  They provide all types of dipping sauces in which my favorite is the ranch.   They also serve a great variety of drinks, in which my favorites are Chocolate Monster Shake and Margarita.  They can be very pricey, however, the portion is worth it. For the service, I would compliment to the guy at the bar at this location who was taking care of me today.  He was quick, efficient and friendly.  I don't know his name, but it seemed like he was well known by several customers.   Overall, Red Robin here is a solid place, but I can't give it a higher star due to the fact that their burgers don't live up to my expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=20

Every time the waiter came by (blonde pony tail) he would make comments to us about how he was single and so many other pick up lines. For example my friend ordered a kind of complicated order and once I said mine after her he goes , okay now you could swipe right for me (referring to the dating website Tinder). Another time he came up saying his zodiac sign and how he's single for whichever one of us wants to date him. Or another time he was like ""I'm not drunk. But I could be drunk when we hangout later"". I swear to you, every single time he came to the table he said some kind of comment like this. There is a time and a place for that kind of talk and waiting on a CUSTOMER is not the time for that! This was just so uncomfortable and so shocking.

Scott S.,"Oak Harbor, WA",87,300,88,2.0,2/25/2016,"Red Robin continues to not impress me.  Their menu changes, their prices go up, but their portion sizes go down.  I'm not happy. We stopped at this location mainly due to the close proximity to the hotel we stayed at.  While our server, Mercedes, was wonderful, and one of the best servers I have experienced in recent times, including at other Red Robin's, the issue remains the food.  10 years ago, Red Robin's had a two sided menu, and the food portions were large, the prices were always higher than a standard fair burger at a fast food join, but the value was there.  I always needed a doggie bag it seemed for my burger, and even for some of the fires, which I never needed to order a second helping of their bottomless fries.   Ever since Red Robin's went to a ""Applebee's"" style booklet for a menu, they are skimping on the portion sizes, and they give you about 10 French fries per serving with their bottomless Fries, making your plate look huge due to the freakishly small serving of fries in a metal cup.  My burger, while tasty, was small.  Much smaller than I remember Red Robin serving in the past.  I got the new special, a ""Southern Charms"" burger, which was with bacon, fried onions, BBQ sauce, and basically all the ""fixin's"" you'd want for a burger that has connotations to the south.  It was on a ciabatta bread bun.  In the past, the burgers were larger in volume.  Not this one.  I didn't even have to disengage my jaw to get my mouth around this burger.  The total for the two adult meals, and two children's meals was about $50.00.  No alcohol was purchased, but this is an expensive outing to me for a young family of four.  This is one of the reasons I do not frequent Red Robin's.  The second has been the bad or lack-there-of service, and finally, the portion sizes are too small now.   Overall, the food was disappointing in the portion size and the price.  Like I said, our server was the highlight, and this is not something to take lightly.  I tip based on service, not on the meal.  Read any of my restaurant reviews and it will reflect on how important good service is.  She is easily carrying one of the two stars that I gave for this Red Robin's!  She was busy training someone, but she checked in often, my water never once went dry, and she was engaging with my kids.  She did the order by memory, and did a fantastic job.  If you come here, don't expect much from the food, but ask for Mercedes to be your server.  You will be glad you did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=20

I went back tonight in hopes of reclaiming another restaurant, but was throughly disappointed. The food was awful. And don't take that lightly.

Dusty D.,"Bothell, WA",0,28,,2.0,11/18/2015,"I've been going to the dirty bird as long as I can remember.  I used to go here for all of my birthday dinners as a kid, and frequented well through college and after (I'm 33 now).  If you can read my last review (from last year) you can see that I still loved my experiences at RR.   That's all changed over the last few months(4-5 visits).  First- the greasy touchscreens cluttering the tables is a terrible addition.  Seriously, like we need another touchscreen in our lives when we sit down for a meal?!  Second- the Redmond location has gotten a remodel, which unfortunately further strips this place's identity and replaces it with sparse walls with about as much personality as a Ballard condo building.  Bring back the goofy wall decorations!  Get rid of the brewpub/upscale look because your menu and tap-list don't stand up to that vibe. As for the food- if you haven't been to a RR in a while, you'll notice less of the traditional burgers, but more of these new ""premium"" burgers.  At $13-14 a pop, you can get a burger that tastes like what the traditional burgers once did.  Now, you get paper-thin bacon and thinner meat patties on the traditional burgers.  (they used to ask you for your cook preference)  Now they just come out medium and flavorless.   Now, for the saving grace- the fries!  Well, the last couple times I've been in, they were clearly sitting for a long time because they tasted like cardboard but were still sent out to my table.  I had to ask for more fries for everyone in our group, because at RR, even if your burger is ok, you know the bottomless fries are on point.  Not so much any more it seems.  What the hell is going on Red Robin?!  You've lost that personality and ecclectic vibe that made me always feel like I'd leave satisfied.  Now we've got touchscreens, tiered burger quality levels, pseudo-upscale decor, and shotty fries...   Sorry, but I've gotta take a break.  Bring the dirtybird back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=40

We asked if we could get a different table and she looked at us with frustration. We asked if we can get a booth, she told us it wasn't available. We then asked if we can sit anywhere but the middle and she got more frustrated, rolled her eyes and said its your choice honestly, I have to go to the front. She then walked away.

Jon L.,"Bellevue, WA",805,2131,9776,3.0,2/23/2013,"Taking one star back. Reason being the service here is a bit slow. It can take a while for the food to come out, especially if your group is large. It made sense that they did serve baskets of fries while the rest of the food was still being made. Today, had a Tavern double burger with bacon ($7.99) and an Irish beer shake ($4.59). The double burger is a smaller burger then the standard options, but paired with the bottomless fries, it is more than enough food. Especially if you get an app or drink. The burger was standardly good. Just what you would expect a burger with bacon to taste like. The bacon supposedly had an aioli, but I didn't taste it really. Shame as that would have took this burger to the next level. The Irish beer shake is a limited time drink available now, assumedly to culminate with the upcoming St. Patrick's Day. It is a mix of Guiness, Jameson whiskey and ice cream. Ingredients that can do no wrong. I wasn't sold on the drink at first, but it eventually won me over. Also, it is reasonably priced for a boozy shake. I would get this over a pint of beer. The food here is good. Though the service can be slow. Still I find this to be a great place for large groups to go since the restaurant is huge and the menu is crowd pleasing.

We always had the same hostess and she always gave my group the worst attitude.  Being greeted by negativity is the biggest turn off.

The food is consistent which is good.  My only complaint is that you CANNOT advertise bottomless fries and not provide them when the customer asks. It's false advertising.   It's happened every single time I've come to this location, and I would say I've been here about 20 times before I finally gave up on this place.  I see that other customers have complained about the same thing.  I don't know if you have a french fry shortage, but if you don't have the supply to meet the demand, then you shouldn't advertise it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=40

Greg L.,"Bellevue, WA",3,19,,2.0,5/17/2016,"I've been going to Red Robin restaurants since the 1980s. They're a great place to take the family because the adults can enjoy something pretty good while the kids have a good time too. I've been going out of our way to go to this branch (on 148th in Redmond, by Sears and across the street from Fred Meyer), even though we're much closer to the Factoria branch, because they have Black Butte Porter beer. It's not on the menu and newer servers don't know about it, but just explain and be patient and soon enough you'll have it in front of you. The other branches do not offer any dark beer at all. The Factoria Branch used to have one called Irish Death, but no longer. But what brought me here today was the worst service I'd ever seen in a Red Robin. Here's the complaint I sent in: ""I've been going to Red Robin restaurants since the 1980s and this is the first time I've complained. The server was friendly and attentive, but there were several problems with the service. I was a restaurant waiter and manager for 6 years, and I was not impressed with today's service.  Here are the problems in the order that they happened:  1) A cup of coffee was served with a large, obvious patch of bright red lipstick.  2) The same cup of coffee was also served without a spoon nor any other way of stirring in the cream.  3) A smoothie drink was served without a straw.  4) A Black & Bleu burger was served without the bleu cheese sauce.  5) When I asked for the sauce that normally goes with the Black & Bleu burger (I have had this excellent burger many times), the server seemed mystified. She came back with cold bleu cheese salad dressing, which was not at all enjoyable with the burger.  6) A child's birthday sundae was served to a 10 year old child without asking nor notifying the parents. That's dangerous; there could be an allergy issue.  7) We had to ask twice for to-go boxes.""

Ben said his system down, he would mail a gift card to me. I never received it.

The one and only reason they get a 5 star rating from me, is their secret weapon, Wade! Honestly he's the one that keeps me coming back, he's attentive, and funny. We adore him. That's the reason we go in.  You can only find Wade working the bar area, so if you have children with you, I guess you're out of luck. Besides my favorite waiter, Red Robin has a few other tidbits going for them (again my opinion), their poppy seed honey mustard sauce, it's a go to / must for years. And their raspberry lime - aide non-alcoholic beverage (for those of us who have had alcohol reek havoc on their lives). It's expensive but comes with free refills. If I could suggest to Red Robin a few ideas- 1. Stop giving out balloons, they're terrible for the environment. I recently watched 2 boys playing outside with them (and one boys crutches) pop, pop, pop, and they just kept going back in for more balloons. Did I mention they didn't clean up their broken bits all over the place. I was fuming, and wanted to screm at them. Upon leaving I picked them up, so I knew it was done before they blew around more. So if you could find compostable balloons then ok, but otherwise please stop giving out balloons. 2. Please bring back the mountain high / mile high mud pie dessert WITH peanut butter. Offer both versions if you want.  I love peanut butter. I'm sorry that some people are allergic, but most of those people read the menu and contamination ect.

Negeen M.,"Bothell, WA",26,5,,2.0,1/6/2015,"I had a great time with good company. Bar was a comfortable nice setting. Nothing too impressive though. (But it is red robin)  Fried zucchini and mushrooms were delicious. We got the black and blue burger which was SUPER yummy.  To drink I had a martini which was decent, and my friend had a couple margeritas (which were super sweet-but some people like them that way). For how slow the bar was I felt like the drinks took kind of a long time to come out. But I know that sometimes when it's slow it's easy to lag a bit. But nothing too ridiculous.  Service and food and drinks were good. Nothing impeccable but it wasn't a BAD experience. So why only 2 stars? Well. I got my bill and apparently red robin charges for a ""double"" beverage when you get a martini. Which I asked about and was told that ""a martini IS a double"". (I have NEVER experienced that-it's a regular drink I get when going out). I didn't want to make a fuss. So I paid for my bill and left and proceeded to call all my bartender friends to ask if that is something they've encountered and all said NO.  In addition for anyone who is curious. A regular liquor drink has 1.5oz of alcohol. A shot is the same. 1.5oz. So a double would come out to 3oz. If I was getting 3oz of liquor in my martini 1)from what I've known to be true you cannot legally serve someone a DOUBLE when they order what is a single beverage. 2)a martini has 2oz of alcohol (which at any other establishment would require an extra dollar or 2 for the 1/2oz of extra liquor. 3) i also recall that you cannot charge someone for what they did not receive. And I did not receive 3oz of vodka. So I would like to know who drank that extra 1oz I paid for.  Yes I realize I went to red robin. Yes I realize this might be an overreaction. BUT it's the point that what they're doing is shady and could potentially be borderline illegal under laws in place by the liquor control board. When it comes to booze.

Service was very slow - was 30 minutes between sitting down and the waitress taking my order. I ordered a simple burger and fries - Order took about 20 minutes to reach me, and was both mildly wrong (burger not cooked as ordered), covered in congealed plastic cheese, and with a very mean amount of fries (about 8 in total - so much for 'bottomless').

The 9 or 10 fries that I got with my sandwich were pretty good though. Our waitress never came back to replenish either fries or drinks or to see how our food was for us.

This location was recently redone, and it looks really nice.  That being said, the service at this location is really hit and miss. I've had great servers there and terrible servers. Service can really make or break your experience at any restaurant, and I don't see a lot of consistency at this place.

On my last visit I made the mistake of ordering wings. They were terrible. Awful. The Woodinville location has much better wings.

The overall taste was bland and the fries with no salt or taste were not helping. I had to drink a lot of water and kind of forced fed myself to get it over with. Red Robin appetizers were good but their quality, burger tastes need to be wayyyy better for the price they charge.

Their menu is flexible in many other ways as well - burger buns can be replaced by lettuce wraps and the variety they offer with salad dressings is incredible! Their food is pretty darn delicious too. Bottomless salted caramel milkshake, mmmmmm. The bleu cheese ribbon burger is delectable - mostly due to the delicious combination of bleu cheese with onion straws. And the endless garlic cheese fries, what a guilty pleasure! This particular Red Robin is filled with some really friendly servers who are ever patient with our boisterous, picky group of friends. In true fast food fashion, service is always prompt!

Alex Henry G.,"Bellevue, WA",0,2,,1.0,3/22/2015,"My family and I have always eaten at this Red Robin for years. For the most part we've had a good experience, the staff has always been pleasant and attentive. Today, that was not the case. Our server  Hayley was dismissive and short with us, it may have been due to the restaurant being a little busier than usual but it's still no excuse to be impolite to your customers. Still, the service was not bad as she didn't have to do much. Just get our order and have someone bring it over. Well she even failed at this simple task as she spilled our drinks as she brought them and left without a word, leaving to clean her mess ourselves.  Though what irked my wife and I was when we ordered a meal to go for our kids. She seemed annoyed that we wanted something to go and had to jot down another order. We ordered a Burger(To be split in half) and two Vanilla Milkshakes.  Our order gets to us and the cups(about 16oz) are only a quarter full....and they charged us $4.99 for this(We had already paid for everything at this point). We complained to Hayley and told us that's ""just the way they are"" but that she would check in the Bar. She came back in less than a minute saying the Bartender told her ""that's all they get now"". We're obviously not happy but decided not to pursue it further since we didn't want them spitting in our food so we left. We get home and find the Burger wasn't split in half which we ended up doing ourselves but Also the Vanilla Milkshakes are actually Banana...so not only did we pay $10 for two milkshakes that wouldn't even fill up a zippy cup but it was also the wrong flavor. At this, I did call the manager about to complain. While today's experience was not indicative of our previous visits, it has definitely left us with a bad taste and we may need to consider a different Red Robin(as we love the food) even if it is a little further away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=80

For happy hour none of the bottled beers are discounted so my Corona was more expensive than I was expecting. The $3.50 margarita on the other hand was a great deal and delicious. My fiance had a rum and coke and it was strong but the rum didn't taste very good. Pretty standard Red Robin but I found the staff here to be better than at other RRs. The kitchen was quick and the drinks were good. Our waiter even stopped by just before happy hour was over to see if we wanted another drink, which was quite nice of him.

They make a little fuss to make sure that things are good for you without making you feel like a jerk, and they exercise good discretion in how much they communicate with you about it.

I was slightly disappointed, but Red Robin has bottomless fries, so that is a definite plus.

Joni H.,"Anchorage, AK",10,23,13,1.0,11/9/2012,"Short version: average food, far less than average service.  If you want red robin, go to a different location. Long version:  We all know what to expect coming I to a red robin as far as the quality of the food is concerned. It's mediocre, affordable burgers, fries and other American classics. If you want the best burger of your life, you should know by now a big chain isn't gonna do it, and if they did, you need to stop eating out so darn much and ask grandma to make you a burger.  The food was exactly as expected. Nothing amazing, nothing terrible (however, my fish and chips were dripping grease, but that's what I get for ordering fish and chips at a burger place). What irritated me most was the service.  The waitress was friendly enough, smiling and whatnot, but i don't think she knew what she was doing. Even though she was training another girl, I'm not sure she'd ver been trained.  Here are some gripes I had with my experience here yesterday written as tips for the waitstaff: 1 Bring out plates with the appetizers. 2 Do not stack plates of food on top of each other when bringing entrees to customers. 3 When you bring out entrees, and there is nothing left of the appetizer, clear those plates, especially if the customer has to stack things to make entrees fit. 4 Your employer advertises bottomless fries. Don't let a customer sit there for 10+ minutes without any before your manager happens to walk by and ask if they want more.  I would have been satisfied with the service if only one or 2 of those things happened, but when it all happens and there's 3 occupied tables in your section (I went at 2-ish pm. Not peak eating time) something's gotta give. I do not recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=80
Charles M.,"Renton, WA",0,70,162,2.0,12/17/2012,"Came in late Thursday night with my wife.  My wife was craving fish and we thought we'd be too late to get to Ivar's and I recalled that the fish sandwiches at Red Robin were pretty tasty, so we stopped in. I ordered the fish sandwich and my wife got the fish and chips.  It took some time for our waiter to get around to us, he apologized and attributed the delay to a group of 10 or so high school students, who were trying to pay individually.  Another server had brought our water over.  My wife has sensitive teeth, but I had forgotten to ask for water with no ice for her.  I tried to get the attention of the server, saying excuse me and waving my arms but he just kept walking to the back. The waiter finally came back with our order and I asked him if we could get a glass of water without ice, and after 5 minutes he brought it over.  My fish was a bit bland and had very little tarter on the bun, and I had forgotten to ask for extra tarter sauce for my fries. My wife was complaining to me that her fish didn't seem quite cooked enough, and asked if mine was the same.  I didn't think so, I told her, but I was so hungry at that point, I'm not sure I'd even notice.  She continued to eat, but I still needed some tarter for my bland fish. I tried to get the waiter's attention, as he looked right at me, then made a left turn to take a different route.  At first I thought he was assisting another customer, when after several minutes of not seeing him emerge, my informed me that he was back in the kitchen area, and that there were no customers in the section he had travelled. He had deliberately avoided me!   I got up and walked back to the prep area, looking around and opening a cooler cabinet, when the waiter came over to me and asked if he could help me.  I told him he could have helped me 10 minutes ago, when I was trying to get some more tarter sauce, but it appeared I was going to have help myself.  He said he would bring it out.  He didn't even offer an apology.     My wife told me she wanted some ketchup for her fries and then I realized that he didn't even offer to bring us any.  I got tired of waiting for him and got up to another table to get some. The waiter came back and asked if we wanted some more fries, and I said yes.  He hadn't walked 10 feet before coming back, and asked ""Did you say you wanted more fries?'   I said again yes.  I asked my wife, if I was talking to low that perhaps he didn't hear me.  She said I she understood perfectly well, and she was further away than the waiter. After dropping $30 bucks and such bad service I'd have to say we won't be back again, and probably not eat at Red Robin any more as a result.  I know it's a chain and I would hope other locations are better, but I'm not going to be saying Red Robin......................yum, anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=80

As a restaurant that bills itself as family- and group-friendly, one would expect them to be able to accomodate large groups, especially since it's a hotspot for kids birthdays. Not the case. I've come here twice on a team lunch, and since we were unable to make reservations, we end up standing around for 20+ minutes while the hosts blink blankly and look around, as if they're hoping some large tables will appear. Last time was the last straw, as they let us stand in the lobby for the requisite 20 minutes while waiting for a table large enough to open up, meanwhile seating smaller parties ahead of us - and finally decided to break us up into smaller parties and seat us in booths. If that was the solution, couldn't we have done that without the wait?  I don't have anything to say about the food, as it's fine. It's the service that's subpar.

Just because its a chain, doesn't mean the food can't be good. I am not a fan of chain burger places. I hate Applebee's, and Chili's, and not a huge fan of TGIF. But Red Robin is delicious!  I will definitely agree with Allie S. that the fries here are kinda hit or miss. But this location, it was a hit for me! I always order my fries extra crispy, and this location got it right the first time! Which never happens. They needed a little bit more salt, but nothing a little ranch dressing couldn't help.  My new favorite burger at RR is the Blue Ribbon Burger, which I ordered here. We also had just joined the Red Robin Royalty program, so we got a free appetizer. And after we order 9 burgers, the 10th one is free. I am not usually a fan of those programs, because I don't eat there enough, but this one seemed worth it to me. We got the Onion Rings and Mozzarella sticks. I already knew that I loved the onion rings here, but OMG the Mozzarella sticks are heavenly. I love fried cheese, how have I never tried these before?!?!?!?  We filled up on the appetizers, so we took most of our burgers home for left overs. And it was still very good warmed up the next day. We went there at 7 pm on a Friday night, and expected to have to wait, but this location was huge, so we were seated right away, which was awesome. I am like a toddler, and hate waiting. Our Server was great too, we always had refills for our drinks, and he got us a box for our leftovers, and didn't seem to mind us sitting there letting our food digest for awhile after finishing dinner. My only complaint was that the appetizer came out, and like 5 minutes later our food came out, which meant we were trying to eat all of it at once, and I was afraid my burger would get cold, and I felt rushed. But in the end, it all worked out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=100
Chris W.,"Seattle, WA",252,132,21,2.0,2/17/2011,"I visited this Red Robin at the request of a coworker, I'm not generally fond of chain restaurants in the style of Friday's or Bennigan's. At least my expectations were set properly. The service was attentive, the walls filled with plasticky garish (what they were going for, I imagine.) I ordered the mac & cheese with side salad and a chocolate malt. The portions of both were big, which was nice, but while I couldn't finish my meal, I had little interest in taking it back with me. The ""four"" cheeses seemed to be a bland, rubbery cheddar strung on top, the blue cheese salad dressing was fair, but too salty. I felt up to my gills in brine from everything but the malt. I appreciate that it's a local chain, but if I'm going to pay ~15$ for an entree and drink, I'd expect slightly better than bland microwaved-from-a-bag product. Hell, Kraft is better.

A word of advice: Unless you like the sound of yelling, giggling teenagers, do NOT go on a Friday night. Made that mistake once...it didn't make me mad because I remember what it was like to be out with friends having fun on the weekends, but now when I go with my family, the noise level is overwhelming. The waiters are pretty inattentive. We had our waiter apologize to us for not coming around AT ALL because it was his cousin's birthday (table of teenagers) and it was his job to make sure they had a fun time. Okay, yes, but that table was not your only table. We still gave him a good tip...why, I have no idea. Probably because we were embarrassed to leave less than $5 and our bill was around $28.

I give them 2 stars, but in all honesty, I eat here quite a bit and have been to this particular Red Robin at least a dozen times, and I'll keep coming back, it's just that there a lot of better places out there. First of all, for the main course, I only come here for burgers. For the price, I consider them to be a great value (which is what keeps me coming back). Every so often they have new burgers on special, so those are a nice treat, especially if you're someone who tires of the same menu. They also offer them with ""some pink in the middle"", as they don't use the terminology medium rare. So they actually come out well done or medium most of the time. It's also impossible to leave here hungry, with their bottomless fries. Although, once I asked for sweet potatoe fries, and they came out cold and as it looked like they had been sitting out for a while. Still, I ate them, as I was curious if perhaps I had a bad batch. So, after my plate was empty, I noticed the water walking by several times without asking me if I wanted more. It seems they are less hesitant to give you more fries if you order the sweet potatoe fries... oh well. I did end up getting another round of them, and they weren't any better.

Tracy S.,"Peterborough, NH",69,273,29,1.0,4/1/2008,"Not sure what makes this Red Robin go bob-bob-bobbin' along. Disclaimer: my son used to work at different Red Robin locations, from Puyallup to San Diego to Del Mar. I've eaten my fair share of burgers and imbibed Flat on Your Beaks up and down the coast. This location was the worst of any burger joint, much less a Red Robin, that I've eaten at. Maybe it was an off night. I can only hope so. Details: Steak fries and onion straws were slightly underdone. The meat in my burger was split in half and an attempt had been made to glue it together with cheese. I'm a big fan of cheese as glue, but this was a burger that should've been consumed by a staffer in the back room, not sent to a paying customer. Because it was split, one half kept falling out. Minus three stars for this alone! Birthday songs at these kinds of places are ubiquitous. Usually, I like looking around to see who the birthday person is and enjoy the staff trying to drum up enthusiasm for whatever birthday song their company makes them sing.  This time, however, the song went on for quite a while, such that our waiter never came back to see how we were doing. After our food was dropped onto our table, we didn't see him again until he appeared with our bill...not even bothering to ask if we wanted anything else (which we did). He did re-do the bill with our newly requested item, but where's the service in that? Also: malteds were low on malt. A real bummer.

First of all, our waitress was less than enthused to be serving me and my 3 friends.  I don't blame her - if I was working as a waitress I would have those nights too.  But, she was MISERABLE!  The night started off with us ordering drinks.  Two of my friends ordered margaritas and me and another ordered a simple diet coke.  My friends with the margs got them after 10 minutes, clearly filled too much and spilling everywhere.  There wasn't even alcohol in one of them.  We also noticed that the waitress didn't check our IDs.  My friends and I, by no means, look remotely old enough to be drinking. The Diet Cokes arrived after another 5 minutes or so.  When we ordered our food, our waitress got verbally impatient because one of my friends was debating between 2 meals.  The server that brought our food out to us didn't even know what the meals were.  He literally said ""I think this is a...uh...cheeseburger?""  REALLY?? After we finished our meal and drinks, we waited another 30 minuted for the waitress to bring us our checks and another 20 minutes for her to take them.  It was insane.

Jessica L.,"Bellevue, WA",3,48,,2.0,6/15/2008,"There are things I do, and don't, like about Red Robin. The biggest thing I don't like is how crazy busy they are! No matter what time you go here, seems like it's always a zoo. And even if the place isn't packed, you don't really get any feel of privacy in this place. It's always noisy and fast paced. The drinks are very good - from non-alcoholic beverages like the strawberry lemon-aid, to their alcoholic beverages - but they are way over priced!  The burgers are good, with a wide selection (the swiss mushroom is my fav) but if you are going with your friends, and you aren't a burger person, your choices will be limited. For what you get, I don't think the burgers are overpriced; just the drinks. Service a lot of times is slow, and your waiter or waitress can be hard to find in the mess of all the other tables.  I like their food, but not really big on the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=140
Michael B.,"Seattle, WA",36,173,7,4.0,1/2/2008,"This Red Robin's location has been here for years. I grew up in this area and while there are a lot of restaurants now, pre-Microsoft campus, this area was kind of out in the boonies...there were literally horse farms in this area people! RR was pretty much all we had. I've been coming here with my parents as long as I can remember and for that reason this location has a special place in my heart. The food here isn't going to win any culinary awards or anything, but it's mighty tasty. I don't care how much of a foodie you are, you gotta give it up for the Robin Bacon Burger and all-you-can-eat steak fries. The BBQ Chicken Wrap is also a winner in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=140
Kellie L.,"Kent, WA",281,383,572,3.0,10/18/2010,"I am so torn on this review.... we go to this Red Robin every year for mine and my friend's birthday.... and we have pretty good service.. this year however, we hit some snags.  I called and made a reservation for 24 and specifically asked if we could sit in the atrium area.  We have a pretty large group and its the only place in the restaraunt that would fit all of us comfortably.  Upon arrival, the table wasnt ready, and even 15-20 mins after it wasnt ready.  They asked if we wanted to move our party to the outside seating area that is heated and quieter.  Ok, we thought we would give it a try.   It is a nice area, and the fact that we could hear each other was nice, and it was perfectly heated.  The downside, you can never get your waitress' attention, because she is actually inside and you are not. She was really efficent with drinks and getting our orders right, but the service took forever.  And again, when you need a refill, you cannot get her attention because she isnt near you.  They brought all 20 of our orders out at once which was cool, so that we could all eat at the same time and be finished at the same time, it was a parade of waitress'/waiters and trays.  And having seperate checks is always hard I know, so she only got one wrong and charged one girl twice. And the other good thing, when you leave from the outer area, you dont have to go through the entire place, it was nice just to walk to your car.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=140

Andy W.,"Bellevue, WA",0,18,,4.0,9/5/2011,its the dirty bird its gonna be good only thing is a lot of the stuff on the menu is pretty fatty but good atmosphere waitresses are nearly always super nice and cute. not always the case with the guys that is the nice part. i am disappointed that they buffalo style clucks n fry's have changed that drippy read sauce is no longer on them idk what it is but not nearly as good. just lookout on friday nights during high school football season it sucks unless your in high school they are everywhere. no seating!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=140
Aaron M.,"Seattle, WA",206,541,10,4.0,2/15/2007,"It is standard Red Robin fare.  I have had both really bad experiences at this location, and really good ones.  So I guess it averages out.  The staff is either kind and attentive or extremely slow and non-existent.  The food is the same as every other RR nothing fantastic but decent.  I don't know what else to say it is RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=140
Melissa S.,"Bellevue, WA",5,27,2,2.0,8/26/2008,"My kids think this place is medium at best. Now that they're a wee bit older the novelty has worn off and the lack of reputable service is more apparent to them. The food arrives quickly but is inconsistent in quality and accuracy.  Service is hit or miss with it usually being a miss. We are very ""good"" customers as I waited tables through college and I get it. However, the majority of the wait staff here are more interested in the daily gossip of their co-workers than the contentment of their patrons. If I'm going out to eat, I'm willing to spend money, so please, just ask me if I want something else before the uncontrollable urge to put down my check in front of me becomes unbearable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=140
