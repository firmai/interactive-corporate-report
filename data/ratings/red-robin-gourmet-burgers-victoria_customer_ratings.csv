27,Rich B.,"Vancouver, Canada",31,195,42.0,3.0,2012-01-03,"If you have read any of my other reviews, you will be familiar with my appreciation for Red Robin. It goes as far as acknowledging that, in general, they make tasty burgers and serve them before my kids have time to lose patience and start destroying the place (their first target typically being the sanity of fellow diners). The fact that they do this in locations as diverse as Vancouver, North Vancouver, Coquitlam and now Victoria, is a bonus. But it just about stops there. My only experience of this particular branch was not a great one. Unfortunately we picked the table with the novice wait staff so service was either frustratingly erratic or charmingly eclectic depending on the pink your spectacles are. To give them credit, though, the food was consistently adequate. At the end of it all the somewhat fraught-looking manager did give us a hefty discount for the inconvenience so I feel that were I to return I could reasonably expect a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
31,Clarice D.,"Victoria, Canada",0,3,,2.0,2012-07-24,"6 of us went to celebrate BD's. Service was ok until I mentioned the ""prime rib"" in the beef dip was full of gristle and so overcooked it was hard. The response was oh sorry; and she started to leave. I asked her to pass my concern along. When I heard nothing I asked what the response was. I was told they said they would try not to do it again. I said that was poor customer service. We will not return. How disappointing as we had a good size bill and it is a good place to take kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472
18,Nick C.,"Richmond, Canada",1,38,68.0,4.0,2013-04-15,"Red Robin is a burger chain restaurant. I suppose they have other things besides burgers, but the main attraction are the burgers. I find Red Robin solid and tasty. It might never be your favourite place, but it's convenient, consistent and average price. You're looking at about $12-14 for a burger/fries meal. The fries are ""bottomless"" although I'm usually full after the burger and first order of fries. They have many different things you can add to your burger as well as replacing the bun with lettuce. (warning: that will make it even more messy). My favourite and the reason that I seem to go back is the fried egg. I wish more places gave the option of an egg in our burger. They really go well together. Some people really like their onion rings, but I find them too bready for me. Service is usually pretty good. Friendly and polite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997

22,Diana L.,"Victoria, Canada",12,231,33.0,3.0,2013-10-27,"Red Robin is always a sure place for a burger and fries . . . .  For the past 20 years I've enjoyed stopping in on the way to something, and I always order the Whiskey River BBQ chicken burger and French fries.   The burger is yummy and big.  The onion straws, and lettuce and tomato make it ""big"".  Not as big as it used to be years ago, but still filling.  The bun is always fresh. The ad pictures never show it rightly - it looks bigger on the menu and in the ads.  But it is prepared as taste expected. The fries are Beefeater.  Not my favourite size, because they are always too soft fried for my preference.   Seasoning salt available on the table is a good idea.   Filling - and even though they are bottomless, I have never needed to ask for a second serving.   Good to know you can ask if you are still hungry. Excellent value, price wise.  Great service on this visit. Usually a line up, so the secret is - ask to be seated at the bar and you will get in near instant.  Not at the bar, but at a table in that area, with the tall seats and tall table, otherwise perfectly fine if you are OK without a booth and don't have kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508
26,Mark M.,"Victoria, Canada",7,128,1.0,4.0,2014-02-18,"While the food here is middle of the road, where it excels is as a kid friendly place.

28,Nancy A.,"Victoria, Canada",0,25,,4.0,2014-09-12,Red Robin has the best gluten-free burgers in town.  (if not the hemisphere).  They have super safe practices so you can be sure that you won't be poisoned by gluten.  This place is super for children and families.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20,,,,,
17,Jenna J.,"Victoria, Canada",8,20,1.0,2.0,2014-10-18,"Took the kiddos to Red Robin tonight for the first time in over a year.  Things have changed!  I watched as servers pushed hard to flip their tables, no one was clearing their own dishes in our section (a guy with a bus bin came and cleared each heaping mess once the guests were gone) and our server in particular seemed extra keen on getting us out. Not one coffee refill offered, but she was in a mad rush to drop the kids' sundaes off while they were still eating their mains and dropping the bill then waving the debit machine in my face.  The machine itself automatically gave the tip options of 15/20/40(?!)percent or 'Other'.  A little presumptuous, Red Robin?   I know volume is high but I've never before felt like a head in a herd of cattle being led in and out like tonight. Oh, and my burger was thin and scorched, but It wasn't the worst thing I've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria,,,,,
25,Jen S.,"Montreal, Canada",0,3,,4.0,2015-01-08,"I agree with Nancy A...good gluten free burgers!  The server was super friendly and knowledgeable about gluten free eating.  I ordered a burger with guacamole and she immediately knew the spice mix in the guac had wheat, and offered to substitute with sliced avacado.  They even have gluten free beer to go with your burger!  I would recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20,,,,,
20,Warren E.,"Capital Regional District, Canada",0,30,,4.0,2015-04-28,"This is still my Goto place for a burger craving.  While I occasionally try something different it is usually the Whiskey River Beef Burger for me.  The sauce is perfect and it always hits the spot.  I still think they should have a choice of different type of fries at a burger speciality place but the volume of business they do here shows they don't need to.  This particular location is always consistent great quality and service with plenty of free refills on your drinks.  Get a couple extra napkins, not a neat meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20,,,,,

With bottomless fries (yam one's too) and unlimited refills on selected refreshments this is a go to place after some afternoon shopping in the area.  Excellent choices for the kiddos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria,,,,,
21,Sergey A.,"Toronto, Canada",0,16,2.0,2.0,2015-12-24,"The service is good, but the food is below average.

14,Josh V.,"Victoria, Canada",44,48,13.0,2.0,2016-03-27,"I like Red Robin as much as the next guy, but their newly renovated decor is A-W-F-U-L.  They took this nice big, bright open space and closed it off with walls and tinted glass; turning it into a dark, grey, and blood red moody nightmare. The whole area is depressing and awkward.  It's trying to be something it's not, and is almost reminiscent of the decor at Browns in Langford (but more closed off). They took what was unique and fun (and kid friendly) about Red Robins and utterly killed it.  Wouldn't be surprised if it hurt their business. I certainly won't be back as much. There are much nicer environments close by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria,,,,,
24,Leanne A.,"Indio, CA",10,5,,4.0,2016-07-11,great food - fantastic waiter - don't bother ordering the $16.50 smoke and pepper burger.. not much different from the regular $10.99 burger... patty was identical... not worth the $5.00 up charge!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20,,,,,
13,Stephanie D.,"Victoria, Canada",108,142,330.0,4.0,2016-07-25,"Always enjoy coming here for some tasty burgers. They've also got some of the best bottomless coffee in my opinion! Nutritionally, these burgers are not your friend, however if you use the online nutritional calculator you can customize your burger so you won't feel as guilty by the end of your meal. I got the chicken teriyaki on whole wheat, minus the mayo, provolone instead of swiss, and added guac. It was by no means mind blowing, but definitely delicious for when you're out and wanting a burger made to order! Do NOT omit the grilled pineapples... they ARE the burger!!!!! Delicious and juicy. The service here is what amazes me most. Mike was our server and he was super friendly, personable, attentive, and made our time here really memorable! In all, burgers are good, price is fair, atmosphere is kid-friendly, and you'll have a good time. The biggest perk is the bottomless coffee and fries along with the nutritional calculator you won't get if eating somewhere that isn't franchised like red robins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria,,,,,
19,JeanMarc C.,"Winnipeg, Canada",3,3,2.0,1.0,2016-08-23,"Our food was awful. Our service was awful. I would never recommend this place to anyone.  The food didn't look anything like the menu. I asked for extra lettuce with my burger. It had almost none. I had to ask for extra lettuce. When my burger came out it had like 8 fries. It's supposed to come with unlimited fries. I don't want to have to ask for fries every 2 minutes. My wife's meal was missing salsa and taco chips. It couldn't of been any worse. We wanted more coke, so we left our glasses at the end of the table. She asked us if we wanted more after we were finished dinner. What a joke. It's like they were trying to save on their over head.

7,Jana B.,"Richmond, Canada",2,118,39.0,2.0,2017-03-20,"March 20 2016. I came here with my family of 5 because my seven year old daughter loves Red Robin and since we are in Victoria on for vacation, I thought it would be a nice surprise for her. The wait to be seated was fairly quick considering it was 6 pm. The server who was assigned to us was flustered, absent minded and would later become abrupt and rude. The adults ordered first and then the kids, both ordered a kids' meal. My oldest daughter hadn't finished placing her order when she moved on to my other kid. When the food came the server forgot the dip for the carrots and the kids drinks. Instead of saying something diplomatic, she said they never ordered drinks, then asked them what they wanted. Both kids specified no ice and both drinks came back with what looked like extra ice. My kids speak English and were very clear, so that wasn't the problem. During our meal the server comes in with the bill, we are still eating dinner, she does not ask them about what sundae they want or if us adults want dessert. Annoyed I asked her if they still have dessert included in the kids meal. The kids ordered the same sundae and my husband asked if they want different flavours. The server cuts in and says ""I heard them, they both want chocolate"". I hate tension and I don't consider myself or my family difficult customers, but I could feel the tension from the moment the server took our orders, it was uncomfortable. Didn't tip and won't be coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

I have also visited this location quite a few times in recent times and have been pretty satisfied. However this past visit was a bit disappointing, there must have been no manager present or something during a slow time. Food took forever and was wrong, poutine was tiny. Basic drinks were never filled, ever. Expediter brought food and the waitress never really checked on us after. Staff were chatting like crazy in the back instead. If I hadn't had good experiences here before I would have given one star. I've worked as a bartender and server before so I have a general expectation of service, this didn't even come close.
