Leti G.,"Tempe, AZ",60,40,17,3.0,6/14/2015,This place needs new management. The quality of food has gone down. The atmosphere is not how it used to be. The I got the sliders.

Ron O.,"Tempe, AZ",0,21,,1.0,4/5/2016,"I usually don't order meals online. I prefer to call the restaurant. They had a simple online ordering, I ordered a meal for curbside pick up, received a confirmation email, went to the restaurant sat there for 10 minutes called the restaurant phone number and was told sorry we have no specialist tonight. Then I was hung up on!So much for customer service!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40
Christina M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",9,256,39,1.0,1/18/2016,"The ONLY reason they got a star is for Lexi, the hostess. We came in on a Monday night, the host put our name in, Lexi chatted us up while we waited (he said 5 min), another family of 5 walks in, the loud ass lady claims, ""I got kids, we need to be seated right away""!. Well, lady, I hate corporate places but when your family wants to eat somewhere, you gotta go so F you, wait your damn turn! The manager, Michelle, comes over, takes the wait list from Lexi and proceeds to find these people a table and then seats them before us!! I'm beside myself! I calmly explain to my family why we don't eat at corporate and we left. Felt bad for the poor hostess,  apologizing profusely because her manager sucks at her job. I hope she gets a real job at a better restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40
Mike M.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,32,24,1.0,4/19/2015,"Why is every place going downhill? When we arrived we were told it was just shift change and they needed a second to clean a table. No big deal. We didn't even wait a whole minute before we were seated... Drinks ordered and arrived quickly. We were a little slow ordering. We were trying to decide on the 2 for $20/$25 deal or something else. Fajitas disappeared from the menu, but they still serve them. Once I found that out, we were ready to order. Now I wonder if mentioning shift change was a pre-excuse for the horrible service we were about to get... We ordered what used to be labeled as the Bottomless Chips and Salsa. Price is up by a $1. Thanks, Obamacare! It used to come out on their big round raised plate/tray with a semi-small bowl of salsa. That was OK because they always come back to the table often enough to keep you deep in salsa. Now it comes out on a much smaller tray with a tiny cup of salsa and a few chewy, stale chips... We thought, well, they'll be running their buts off filling that cup... That might have been so if we had seen our server even once before our food arrived. Actually, our server wasn't the one that brought our food so we didn't see her for a while afterward. Our food had come and our drinks (an iced tea and a water) had been sitting empty for a while. When our server finally made an appearance, she still didn't notice our drinks. We had to mention it to her. I know that sounds a little entitled, but there are expectations of service that used to be standard. You always refill a drink u[ to and while food is on the table or AT LEAST ask to. Half way into our meals we lost interest in the $4 chips and salsa sample. The entrees were great. At the very least the kitchen is still staffed be good people. I always order the steak fajitas, medium rare, and I eat the steak like a steak and then make veggie tacos out of the rest. I fricken love it. This time I was not disappointed. The steak was not medium rare (they never get that right) but it was still delicious. My dinner companion had a 7oz sirloin and it too was mouth-watering and juicy. Also not cooked as ordered (medium) but that meant I got the redder portions so, no complaint from me there... We actually got asked if we wanted another refill before we completed our meals. That was nice. However, after we had finished out food we had the desert/drink menu in hand and the waitress walks up and plops the check down and walks away. I may have some strong ideas about service but I don't know any manager that would train tyheir staff to miss an opportunity to offer drinks and deserts. That's not how you sell. So, it may have been mean but, we left no tip and stopped at DQ for a cone on the way home. We've already blacklisted the Applebee's on Baseline at 24th St. because of similar service, getting orders and drinks completely wrong, and billing us for things we did not order. This one is going on the list as well. Next time we'll drive all the way out to Baseline and 51st Ave. They seem to still understand customer service out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40

Jessica T.,"Chandler, AZ",0,9,,1.0,8/20/2015,"I used to love going to Applebees for their beer on tap. Their beer is still really good and reasonably priced, but that would be my only reason for ever going back here! Applebees has changed their menu since I've last been here. They raised their prices and cut back their portions. My husband ordered a burger which was $11 and subpar. Red Robin has the same tasting hamburgers but charges less.  This restaurant charges $2.50 just to swap out french fries for onion rings. They also had these game systems on the tables. You can play trivia and other games while you wait but each game adds .99 cents onto your bill. .99 cents isn't a lot of money but why add to your bill to play a game when you should be socializing with who you are out to dinner with anyways?? It's just really petty to charge extra for stupid little things. Especially when the food and atmosphere is not that great at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40
Alan H.,"Chandler, AZ",11,119,61,3.0,11/2/2015,Wasn't great but it hit the spot. Meaning all I had was a side salad! Ordered a tea and it took awhile to get that! The menu was hard to find the side salad - must have looked for it through the menu 3-4 times before I found it. Wasn't wanting their soup and salad all you can eat. It came out fairly reasonable amount of time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40

Natalie L.,"Chandler, AZ",55,15,,1.0,9/18/2015,Such a bummer that I have to change a review from really good to bad. On 09/06/2016 I placed an order over the phone to go for my husband to pick up once he got off work. There isn't an applebees near us in South Chandler and this location is close to his work. When he got home as we were ready to set everyones dinner we were missing one full kids order and half of another kids order. My husband headed back with ALL of the food because we werent going to eat our food cold or eat our food before our kids did. Took it all back for them to remake the entire order. We definitely don't complain to look for handouts but you would think because of how much of an inconvenience this was they would offer more than a dessert which we never even ended up getting anyways. My husband was told he was good to go that they guaranteed it. Once again he got home with food and still a kids order was missing a side. I really hope this staff gets a little more coaching. Our kitchen is under quarantine with no access to a stove or microwave because of a mold issue so we have had to rely on take out for the past few days and having to deal with messed up orders makes everything just that much more frustrating.  I give this place 5 stars because I walked in during lunch hour hoping to get an easy to go order since I was in a hurry and although at first one of the waitresses said it was going to be a very long time she did go double check and the manager and a server came out and said they could do it in about 15 min. As I was standing there waiting I was definitely not ignored several servers passed by me and asked if I was being helped and the bartender even offered me something to drink while I wait. Kuddos to them for the effort and thank you for filling my order very quickly on such a busy hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40

Generally I like Medium rare, but they don't do that. I choose Pink and got a 'well done' probably Mircowaved burger that seemed to have semi burnt burger flakes from a previous burger.

Dan W.,"Gilbert, AZ",19,54,71,2.0,3/2/2014,"My streak of good reviews has come to an end.  Now if we can just do the same to Justin Beiber's life expectancy. I guess it was my fault for choosing to eat at a chain restaurant after lunch rush when the servers were trying to get their side work done and get out.  Not even going to go into the details of what we ordered otherwise than to say it was incorrect, disappointing, took an excessive amount of time to prepare, and overall was a waste of time and money. I'm so frustrated with the restaurant and service industry. I hear often servers and other related staff complain about bad tippers. ""If you can't afford to tip, don't go out to eat."" How many times have you heard someone say that?  I have a better saying. If you aren't good at your job. Go find another one and save the rest of the world from having to deal with your horrible work ethic combined with the American sense of entitlement.

With this location, the question is, how long do you have to wait for your meal? ( esp. when the place is half empty) After 15 minutes maybe the server could say your meal will be here soon or would you care for some tortilla chips while you're waiting? After 20 minutes, still nothing......25 minutes ...no food, no response from the server. At 30 minutes, sorry Applebee's .... You've been Chopped!

Xi L.,"New York, NY",174,478,176,4.0,12/26/2015,"I dig their quesadilla burgers and triple chocolat meltdowns, it gets me every time. The quesadilla burger is a work of art, its not messy at all to eat, has the feel and texture of a proper quesadilla with the tortilla bun and somehow the final cook along with all of the toppings come out perfectly and in tact. The flavor is is great and consistency is for the most part there. This time we also had a loaded brisket enchilada and that was decent. They give you enough meat to keep you satisfied, comes with rice, salsa, jalapenos, cheese, etc. Yea we went full Mexican for this lunch. Finishing it all off we had the almighty triple chocolate meltdown aka the best lava cake money can buy HOWEVER this time the brownie wasnt super hot as it usually is, it was room temp, the fudge was warm but not hot like it normally is. If it was piping hot, the contrast with the vanilla ice cream is what melts your heart away, and is a clear 10/5 on all time best desserts. My other fav dessert around here is the Pizookie from BJ's Brewery and that always comes out hot. Sad, but still 4/5 overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40
R G.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,1,,2.0,11/9/2016,"Went with my son and a friend of ours on a weekday night. It was Nov. 3rd to be exact. First of all the menu doesn't have as many good selections as it used to. I just wasn't in the mood for anything on the menu and I used to love going to AppleBee's. Our waiter came and right away I felt as though I was bothering him. The impression we received is (I have a lot to do hurry and tell me what you want). This is the first review I am giving on yelp, yet realize this has to be read by the establishment (or so I would hope) and they then can work on what needs to be improved. About half way through the meal I don't know what happened but the waiter became friendlier which was nice. The appetizers were good though. The main point of my review is to let servers know to please treat customers friendly from the beginning to end. I am sure they work hard and the customers who came in most likely worked hard all day as well. As for the menu well I probably won't ever go to an Applebee's again. Food selection wasn't good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40

Scott G.,"Chandler, AZ",85,21,5,5.0,8/4/2017,"This review is for you if you often find yourself looking for decently priced sit-down style dining in the late evening... Believe me I know: After 10pm there is not much for sit-down selection, and everyone knows the service almost always is terrible and sometimes the food too...when you walk into a restaurant after 9 when it closes at 10.... I admit I walked in to here after delaying my eating to the point where selection was slim(9:15ish)... I wanted Japanese but unfortunately the hipsters and millennials had taken over all of the Japanese restaurants to eat their cold, raw, ""delicious"", sushi .. I walked into a Japanese restaurant that had a revolving sushi bar, a list where you write your own name down, twenty people STANDING at the entrance, and went ungreeted - it appeared that's the way the business was meant to be until you sit down and get service. .. I went to put my name on the list and immediately changed my mind.. HECK, that list made me feel like a loser because EVERYONE on it had more than one person, and here I am, this restaurant wants me to proclaim to everyone who views the waiting list that I am the only loner in the room!  So I went to Applebee's down the street.  On a Friday night they had domestic pints for $2.29 - wow!  They close at 1 so I felt in no hurry. At 10:00 the entire restaurant was busy and provided a great vibe. Food deal was amazing for the price.

The stirfry steak was good but the stirfry was very little stirfry on lots of rice.  The Mac and cheese,  chicken drenched in a sweet syrup on to of the dish, didn't work.  All round, keep looking, you'll surely find much better than this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7

For the $1 margaritas, there is no catch, you go in and can get drink after drink after drink for a dollar (50 cents extra for different flavors) the only problem is that they water the drink down after the first one. I came in expecting to leave a bit tipsy, but was basically sipping on juice/grenadine and water by the third one. The food was terrible, it literally tasted like it went from freezer, to microwave, plate, to us...and this was after our waiter forgot what we ordered twice. He did the same for the margaritas, completely forgetting what was ordered and making us wait a very long time. I blame most of this on the rush of a Friday night, but I also think that the restaurant didn't anticipate the high influx of people looking to get cheap alcohol. It wasn't that they were understaffed, it was that the staff was unorganized and overwhelmed.

Before we could even read the menu, the server is at our table to take our order. Either they want to get it over & done with, or they do not show up at all. I ordered a Margarita & specifically said not too much ice. I get my drink & the glass is half full of ice. I just let it go, as I did not want to say anything. I  ordered the artichoke & spinach cavaratti as my main meal. I am not even going to say it tasted bad, as there was no taste at all. I don't know what it should even taste like. It was with a basic white sauce & no seasoning at all. Tasted bland. I had to say something at this point as I was hungry & when food does not taste good, I get very upset. There was not eve. 1 piece of Artichoke to be found. I mentioned this to the server & he said there should be Artichoke in it. I moved my food around& showed him there was nothing.  If they did flavor it with some sort of Artichoke flavor, I am sorry, I did not taste it. He then asked if I wanted to speak to a Manager. What was the point? Did the Manager have the artichoke the chef forgot to add? This is my first time there & it will be my last for sure.

Everyone we met was friendly and cheerful, from the ""greeter"" who opened the door to our server, to the manager who stopped by to make sure we were happy. It took us a few minutes to decide what to order. Once we did, the food came out fairly quickly. Impressive, since this was Thanksgiving Day. The server was attentive the whole time.

About 10 minutes later another order was delivered to my table. This time it was HOT and cooked through. The point of this review is not to condemn the entire restaurant for the mistake of one cook. The manager's apology was appropriate but an offer to comp the dinner would have been more appropriate and appreciated. Things could have been worse - under-cooked fish - just sayin'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=20

Melanie B.,"Chandler, AZ",0,31,8,1.0,7/30/2015,"If you hate your job why work there?  Probably won't be going to Applebee's  anymore, I've given this place too many chances and it only gets worse with time. Prices went up and portions went down. The bartender did not seem happy to be there at all. I've worked in the service industry for 3 years (and still do) and I know that no matter how bad your night maybe you put on a damn smile and be friendly, or at the least attempt to be.  I know what is annoying to wait staff so I try to be an easy customer. I knew it was happy hour because that's why we went and I like the happy hour drinks, did not receive the happy hour menu that says what food/drinks were on happy hour, fine whatever, didn't ask for it. Got a drink that I knew, from previous trips, was on happy hour.  Got an appetizer did not receive silverware or napkins. Whatever fine. They also changed it so the pretzels no longer come with cheese and mustard so I had to ask for the other side, which I got an attitude like I was being bothersome (I ask politely and always say thank you). Again whatever. Got the Thai shrimp salad (sub shrimp for chicken.) This is when we got silverware. Got the salad and I stared at it for a minute, noticing the large bowl but very small amount of salad. See the picture on the menu? Cut that amount in half, that's what you get. It was premixed lettuce/carrot/cabbage, like what you find in the veggie section at Walmart, with edamame beans and the smallest amount of dressing I have ever seen, literally just a drizzle of dressing on top. I ask for a side of dressing. I kept looking at it wondering why the salad appeared different from what the picture was when I ordered, well I looked on the Applebee's online menu, out of pure irritation, it was also supposed to have crunchy wonton noodles, almonds, and cilantro, which my salad did NOT have. How do you miss THREE main parts of the salad?! Asked us how we were after our food was done.   At this point I'm just kind of over being there. He was probably the most unfriendly bartender I have ever experienced, you shouldn't feel like your bothering a server when asking for something, that is there job and why you tip, for the service. We still tipped the normal 20% purely based off of being in the industry, not because he deserved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=20
Scott G.,"Chandler, United States",85,21,5,5.0,4/8/2017,"This review is for you if you often find yourself looking for decently priced sit-down style dining in the late evening... Believe me I know: After 10pm there is not much for sit-down selection, and everyone knows the service almost always is terrible and sometimes the food too...when you walk into a restaurant after 9 when it closes at 10.... I admit I walked in to here after delaying my eating to the point where selection was slim(9:15ish)... I wanted Japanese but unfortunately the hipsters and millennials had taken over all of the Japanese restaurants to eat their cold, raw, ""delicious"", sushi .. I walked into a Japanese restaurant that had a revolving sushi bar, a list where you write your own name down, twenty people STANDING at the entrance, and went ungreeted - it appeared that's the way the business was meant to be until you sit down and get service. .. I went to put my name on the list and immediately changed my mind.. HECK, that list made me feel like a loser because EVERYONE on it had more than one person, and here I am, this restaurant wants me to proclaim to everyone who views the waiting list that I am the only loner in the room!  So I went to Applebee's down the street.  On a Friday night they had domestic pints for $2.29 - wow!  They close at 1 so I felt in no hurry. At 10:00 the entire restaurant was busy and provided a great vibe. Food deal was amazing for the price.

For the $1 margaritas, there is no catch, you go in and can get drink after drink after drink for a dollar (50 cents extra for different flavors) the only problem is that they water the drink down after the first one. I came in expecting to leave a bit tipsy, but was basically sipping on juice/grenadine and water by the third one. The food was terrible, it literally tasted like it went from freezer, to microwave, plate, to us...and this was after our waiter forgot what we ordered twice. He did the same for the margaritas, completely forgetting what was ordered and making us wait a very long time. I blame most of this on the rush of a Friday night, but I also think that the restaurant didn't anticipate the high influx of people looking to get cheap alcohol. It wasn't that they were understaffed, it was that the staff was unorganized and overwhelmed.

I had not been to Applebees before & thought we will try it out as I had a Gift Card. There were so many booths & tables open & the person who seats the guests is looking around for a table while stand there. Before we could even read the menu, the server is at our table to take our order. Either they want to get it over & done with, or they do not show up at all. I ordered a Margarita & specifically said not too much ice. I get my drink & the glass is half full of ice. I just let it go, as I did not want to say anything. I  ordered the artichoke & spinach cavaratti as my main meal. I am not even going to say it tasted bad, as there was no taste at all. I don't know what it should even taste like. It was with a basic white sauce & no seasoning at all. Tasted bland. I had to say something at this point as I was hungry & when food does not taste good, I get very upset. There was not eve. 1 piece of Artichoke to be found. I mentioned this to the server & he said there should be Artichoke in it. I moved my food around& showed him there was nothing.  If they did flavor it with some sort of Artichoke flavor, I am sorry, I did not taste it. He then asked if I wanted to speak to a Manager. What was the point?

Mike M.,"Phoenix, United States",8,32,24,1.0,19/4/2015,"Why is every place going downhill? When we arrived we were told it was just shift change and they needed a second to clean a table. No big deal. We didn't even wait a whole minute before we were seated... Drinks ordered and arrived quickly. We were a little slow ordering. We were trying to decide on the 2 for $20/$25 deal or something else. Fajitas disappeared from the menu, but they still serve them. Once I found that out, we were ready to order. Now I wonder if mentioning shift change was a pre-excuse for the horrible service we were about to get... We ordered what used to be labeled as the Bottomless Chips and Salsa. Price is up by a $1. Thanks, Obamacare! It used to come out on their big round raised plate/tray with a semi-small bowl of salsa. That was OK because they always come back to the table often enough to keep you deep in salsa. Now it comes out on a much smaller tray with a tiny cup of salsa and a few chewy, stale chips... We thought, well, they'll be running their buts off filling that cup... That might have been so if we had seen our server even once before our food arrived. Actually, our server wasn't the one that brought our food so we didn't see her for a while afterward. Our food had come and our drinks (an iced tea and a water) had been sitting empty for a while. When our server finally made an appearance, she still didn't notice our drinks. We had to mention it to her. I know that sounds a little entitled, but there are expectations of service that used to be standard. You always refill a drink u[ to and while food is on the table or AT LEAST ask to. Half way into our meals we lost interest in the $4 chips and salsa sample. The entrees were great. At the very least the kitchen is still staffed be good people. I always order the steak fajitas, medium rare, and I eat the steak like a steak and then make veggie tacos out of the rest. I fricken love it. This time I was not disappointed. The steak was not medium rare (they never get that right) but it was still delicious. My dinner companion had a 7oz sirloin and it too was mouth-watering and juicy. Also not cooked as ordered (medium) but that meant I got the redder portions so, no complaint from me there... We actually got asked if we wanted another refill before we completed our meals. That was nice. However, after we had finished out food we had the desert/drink menu in hand and the waitress walks up and plops the check down and walks away. I may have some strong ideas about service but I don't know any manager that would train tyheir staff to miss an opportunity to offer drinks and deserts. That's not how you sell. So, it may have been mean but, we left no tip and stopped at DQ for a cone on the way home. We've already blacklisted the Applebee's on Baseline at 24th St. because of similar service, getting orders and drinks completely wrong, and billing us for things we did not order. This one is going on the list as well.

Their beer is still really good and reasonably priced, but that would be my only reason for ever going back here! Applebees has changed their menu since I've last been here. They raised their prices and cut back their portions. My husband ordered a burger which was $11 and subpar. Red Robin has the same tasting hamburgers but charges less.  This restaurant charges $2.50 just to swap out french fries for onion rings. They also had these game systems on the tables. You can play trivia and other games while you wait but each game adds .99 cents onto your bill. .99 cents isn't a lot of money but why add to your bill to play a game when you should be socializing with who you are out to dinner with anyways??

We definitely don't complain to look for handouts but you would think because of how much of an inconvenience this was they would offer more than a dessert which we never even ended up getting anyways. My husband was told he was good to go that they guaranteed it. Once again he got home with food and still a kids order was missing a side. I really hope this staff gets a little more coaching. Our kitchen is under quarantine with no access to a stove or microwave because of a mold issue so we have had to rely on take out for the past few days and having to deal with messed up orders makes everything just that much more frustrating.  I give this place 5 stars because I walked in during lunch hour hoping to get an easy to go order since I was in a hurry and although at first one of the waitresses said it was going to be a very long time she did go double check and the manager and a server came out and said they could do it in about 15 min. As I was standing there waiting I was definitely not ignored several servers passed by me and asked if I was being helped and the bartender even offered me something to drink while I wait. Kuddos to them for the effort and thank you for filling my order very quickly on such a busy hour.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=40

I guess it was my fault for choosing to eat at a chain restaurant after lunch rush when the servers were trying to get their side work done and get out.  Not even going to go into the details of what we ordered otherwise than to say it was incorrect, disappointing, took an excessive amount of time to prepare, and overall was a waste of time and money. I'm so frustrated with the restaurant and service industry. I hear often servers and other related staff complain about bad tippers. ""If you can't afford to tip, don't go out to eat."" How many times have you heard someone say that?  I have a better saying. If you aren't good at your job.

Xi L.,"New York, United States",174,478,176,4.0,26/12/2015,"I dig their quesadilla burgers and triple chocolat meltdowns, it gets me every time. The quesadilla burger is a work of art, its not messy at all to eat, has the feel and texture of a proper quesadilla with the tortilla bun and somehow the final cook along with all of the toppings come out perfectly and in tact. The flavor is is great and consistency is for the most part there. This time we also had a loaded brisket enchilada and that was decent. They give you enough meat to keep you satisfied, comes with rice, salsa, jalapenos, cheese, etc. Yea we went full Mexican for this lunch. Finishing it all off we had the almighty triple chocolate meltdown aka the best lava cake money can buy HOWEVER this time the brownie wasnt super hot as it usually is, it was room temp, the fudge was warm but not hot like it normally is. If it was piping hot, the contrast with the vanilla ice cream is what melts your heart away, and is a clear 10/5 on all time best desserts. My other fav dessert around here is the Pizookie from BJ's Brewery and that always comes out hot.

First of all the menu doesn't have as many good selections as it used to. I just wasn't in the mood for anything on the menu and I used to love going to AppleBee's. Our waiter came and right away I felt as though I was bothering him. The impression we received is (I have a lot to do hurry and tell me what you want). This is the first review I am giving on yelp, yet realize this has to be read by the establishment (or so I would hope) and they then can work on what needs to be improved. About half way through the meal I don't know what happened but the waiter became friendlier which was nice. The appetizers were good though. The main point of my review is to let servers know to please treat customers friendly from the beginning to end. I am sure they work hard and the customers who came in most likely worked hard all day as well. As for the menu well I probably won't ever go to an Applebee's again.

The only help she had was the host, Alex, who was seating tables, cleaning tables and checking on food and tables for her. He is doing more than the 6 other servers in the restaurant.

It was about 9:45 on a Friday night so it was a little busy but there were two bartenders behind the bar which is unusual for this Applebee's. The one that unfortunately helped me was either new or just didnt give a shit. His name was Aaron. I was annoyed because you should never sit a bar for 10 minutes before being greeted, I almost just left but then Aaron decided to help. I ordered a jack and coke. He walked around the bar a bit, then walked out of bar area and I didnt see him for a few minutes. When he did come back it was obvious he had forgotten my drink but he made it quickly and I was happy. Long story short I had to ask for another drink after being empty for a bit, just poor service. I gave 3 stars because I come here fairly often and this is not typical. I would just ask for another server/bartender if a guy named aaron walks up. He doesnt care, dont even give him a chance.

The poor schmuck behind the bar was tasked with covering/serving the entire bar area including all the hi-tops and booths AND mix drinks.  I ordered and was served a drink relatively quickly given the short staffing. Upon ordering a refill I placed an order for the fish and chips. My food was served within 10 - 15 minutes. The first bite was good but the closer I got to the middle of the piece of fish the colder the food became until it was just plain cold. After informing the bar tender/waiter and sending the plate back, the manager on duty stepped up and apologized for the under-cooked food. About 10 minutes later another order was delivered to my table. This time it was HOT and cooked through. The point of this review is not to condemn the entire restaurant for the mistake of one cook. The manager's apology was appropriate but an offer to comp the dinner would have been more appropriate and appreciated.

Probably won't be going to Applebee's  anymore, I've given this place too many chances and it only gets worse with time. Prices went up and portions went down. The bartender did not seem happy to be there at all. I've worked in the service industry for 3 years (and still do) and I know that no matter how bad your night maybe you put on a damn smile and be friendly, or at the least attempt to be.  I know what is annoying to wait staff so I try to be an easy customer. I knew it was happy hour because that's why we went and I like the happy hour drinks, did not receive the happy hour menu that says what food/drinks were on happy hour, fine whatever, didn't ask for it. Got a drink that I knew, from previous trips, was on happy hour.  Got an appetizer did not receive silverware or napkins. Whatever fine. They also changed it so the pretzels no longer come with cheese and mustard so I had to ask for the other side, which I got an attitude like I was being bothersome (I ask politely and always say thank you). Again whatever. Got the Thai shrimp salad (sub shrimp for chicken.) This is when we got silverware. Got the salad and I stared at it for a minute, noticing the large bowl but very small amount of salad. See the picture on the menu? Cut that amount in half, that's what you get. It was premixed lettuce/carrot/cabbage, like what you find in the veggie section at Walmart, with edamame beans and the smallest amount of dressing I have ever seen, literally just a drizzle of dressing on top. I ask for a side of dressing. I kept looking at it wondering why the salad appeared different from what the picture was when I ordered, well I looked on the Applebee's online menu, out of pure irritation, it was also supposed to have crunchy wonton noodles, almonds, and cilantro, which my salad did NOT have. How do you miss THREE main parts of the salad?! Asked us how we were after our food was done.   At this point I'm just kind of over being there. He was probably the most unfriendly bartender I have ever experienced, you shouldn't feel like your bothering a server when asking for something, that is there job and why you tip, for the service.

I never thought I could become a fan of such a corporatey chain as Applebee's... but it truly is the staff that makes the place. Everybody here is super friendly. Robert is a fantastic bartender, and hardly ever short on ideas for new drinks. On top of all that, they've got karaoke on Tuesday nights that is a blast! Yes, you read that right. Karaoke at Applebee's. Crazy, I know, but lots of fun regardless. Oh yeah and their shredded pork wonton tacos... YUM!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
H B.,"Cedmont, Baltimore, United States",6,33,31,2.0,17/2/2015,"It's official, Applebee's has really gone down hill. It doesn't matter what part of the country I go they are just not what they used to be. For starters, they changed the menu several times, making the portions smaller and smaller every time. The quality is not what it was once upon a time. We order our classic spinach and artichoke did and boneless chicken. The chicken was cold when it arrived, and the size of the spinach dip was half of what it used to be. The service was great, the bartender waited on our table during reverse happy hour, he was attentive and prompt. It is not his fault for the screw ups in the kitchen. Our mixed drinks were about the only thing that was good about our meal. The perfect margarita was perfect (considering others always screwed up in Easton, MD) I didn't have to question the bartender on what he added he followed the recipe to the T. Hopefully Applebee's corporate management gets their act together and get the menu back to what it was once.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
Brian L.,"Phoenix, United States",0,2,,1.0,6/2/2015,"I will not eat at this Applebee's again. I ordered to go. The food was cold, very greasey and did not taste good. The salad I payed almost $4.00 for was tiny and limp. The only thing that my family ordered that was good was the ranch dressing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
David L.,"Chandler, United States",3,4,,2.0,4/11/2013,"Worst service ever, couldnt get our orders right, brought our food before our kids food. Didnt even give us silverware or napkins or plates for our appetizer. When they did bring plates, they were wet! Horrible.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
Tiffany W.,"Phoenix, United States",18,49,1,1.0,19/10/2012,"Kristie C service today was horrible. Took too long to take drink order, took to long to take food order, food took forever to arrive and it wasn't even hot! Garlic bread was cold! Kid never got refill, another person in my party water was taken to refill but never brought back. Took forever to receive check. I'm a regular at this Applebee's but I will not be going back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
LuckieMaounds P.,"Coppell, United States",153,594,6,3.0,27/7/2010,"Good reverse happy hour. And the pictures in the menu *look* phenomenal. Richard Christie might have something with his love of aaaaaaaapple beeeeeeeeeeeeessssssss...  but honestly, the reverse happy hour has a lot of 1/2 off stuff.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
Barbara P.,"Harris County, United States",0,2,,5.0,11/1/2014,Tori is the kindest most polite manager of any restaurant we have ever been to. The other Tempe Applebee's on broadway was rude to my husband because he has Alzheimer's disease. Tori treated him with only kindness and  respect. Thank you tori.

Jake P.,"Tempe, United States",24,24,4,1.0,21/2/2010,"(It's been over a year since I stopped eating at chain restaurants altogether, but since I joined Yelp recently, I thought it might be nice to explain why on a case by case basis.) Cookie cutter food prepared and served by tip-desperate, spirit-crushed, flair-bedecked post adolescents discovering how much corporate food service jobs suck. Bad or non-existent flavors covered up by extra fat and too much salt. Stupid, manufactured decor - where is the factory that makes this crap? Has to be China, or possibly hell. Irresponsible, unappetizing and despair-inducing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
Charisse R.,"Avondale, United States",56,58,30,4.0,26/3/2012,When I think of a place to go for a drink I didn't think of Applebee's but I'm glad I went. They have great drinks and friendly service. The waitress we had removed a drink from my receipt even though I drank the whole drink that I didn't really like. She made sure our glasses were never empty and our food was served hot. They have ladies night every week and kids eat free I think on Tuesday or Wednesday's. I'll be back!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
Coda B.,"Tampa, United States",76,89,17,1.0,15/11/2009,"It took our server here AN HOUR AND A HALF (90 minutes) to get the bill separated. Our server was visibly and audibly having a psychological breakdown, unable to handle a party of 10 with appetizers and drinks for each person. She sat down at the table multiple times, drawing diagrams and equations so complex and confusing I can't even imagine. She was openly complaining to us about her other tables and constantly delivering drinks to the wrong person.  This one star is strictly due to the service. The food and drinks are decent quality and moderately priced so in any other situation I'm sure it would've been three even four stars....",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
Charity S.,"Mesa, United States",31,150,77,3.0,1/12/2011,"We got the 14 minutes or it's free deal, and boy, do they make sure the food gets to you in under 14 minutes, even if it means the hamburger is bloody & the salad looks like it's been sitting in the back of the fridge for 2 weeks. They didn't charge us for our food, thank goodness, but I won't go back there to that location or ask for that deal again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-tempe-7?start=60
