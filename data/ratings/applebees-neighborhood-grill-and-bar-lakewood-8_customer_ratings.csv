I ordered a sirloin rare and it came medium. My friends ordered: steak medium rare and steak medium. Yeah, they all came medium. At least there's consistency. My gripe is when the manager came to tell me that the marinade caused the ""meat to look darker but that it was actually cooked correctly"". I said no, it wasn't and that there's a big difference between rare and medium. They did comp the meal (good on them for that). One of my friends was surprised at this because this had happened to her the previous week and they didn't do a thing. Hit or miss, I guess.

My server greeted me and continued to check up on me while I glanced at the menu. My drink never hit the south end of the levy. I seen the managers come out and handle it if someone did have a issue.  Went with the shrimp and fries and coleslaw. For the price it came with a lot of shrimp and was fried to a nice golden brown. The fries were what you would expect. The coleslaw was creamy and not the vinegar based stuff.  They changed the name from the Molten Lava Cake to the Triple Chocolate Meltdown but its still a Lava Cake and delicious packed with alot of chocolate and comes out hot. Next time ill ask for another scoop of ice cream.  When the bill came and I was ready to leave she asked if I wanted a Togo cup for my sweet raspberry tea.

The bartender was no where in sight for 5 minutes. When he finally showed up he seemed confused of my request. The went to the back to get us two small like 6oz kids cups for the lemonade that I ordered and then charged us full price. Most Applebee's give you like at least a 16oz or whatever size cup they us. Not to mention the place was pretty dirty for 3pm in the afternoon. I highly doubt I'll be returning due to the lack of disappointment of Applebee's every time I try to go.

9,Ashley B.,"Arvada, CO",0,22,,1.0,2015-05-21,"I want to be honest, I was not thrilled when I found out Applebee's had been selected as the place where my family was dining for the evening, not a fan. We walk in and were seated promptly and immediately acknowledged by our waitress.  I couldn't help but notice the table behind us was complaining to the manager about their overcooked steak. I let it slide, after all, it is possible the steak was cooked to order and the customer was being picky. After we ordered drinks and an appetizer, I noticed yet another customer complaining about their food being under-cooked. At this point it was a red flag and we should of left after the appetizer but we stayed and ordered food.  I had the Thai shrimp salad and my mom and dad had hamburgers, which they ordered ""well done"" with no pink. My salad was fine, nothing mind blowing but not disgusting. The burgers were not fine. My dad's hamburger was grossly under-cooked, the entire middle was pink and bloody, my mom's was cooked a little more but still not as ordered. I know that the cooking temperature of meat is largely based upon preference but under-cooking meat to the extent it was is a food safety issue.  We asked for the manager, who was busy hearing yet another complaint regarding the improper cooking of another customer's food. His apology was totally apathetic and he seemed offended that my father declined a new burger. They had been under/over cooking food all night and he was done. He then said he would take the burger off our ticket, but when the bill came, only a portion of the burger was taken off.  Already ""over it"" we paid and left. It was clear that there was an issue in the kitchen and it doesn't seem like an unusual occurrence based on other reviews. If you are unable to properly cook a burger or steak, you should not be in the kitchen, that is how people get food-born illnesses.  Our server was friendly and we realize that she had no control over what happens in the kitchen, so she was left a generous tip regardless. While I'm never fully satisfied by Applebees, this was a new low. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else, anywhere else really.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakewood-8,,,,,

11,Joshua T.,"Lakewood, CO",116,238,256.0,4.0,2015-10-15,"Thrice have I visited this location, and though the service has generally been friendly and proficient, they could certainly use a shot in the arm wherein organization is concerned. Twice was I greeted in short order and seated appropriately to place a to-go order from the bar, at which point I had to wait for a server or bartender to get the message I was awaiting their assistance, and the third I was asked to wait next to a server station to one side of the restaurant for the ""carside to-go"" guy. I explained that I had not placed an order yet (thus, the ""carside to-go"" guy would be of limited assistance) but the lady insisted that he would be able to best assist me, despite the fact the last two times I'd simply placed an order with a regular server and had no issues. Once he came out and greeted me, I asked if I could sit at the bar (like a customer) instead of standing in the corner (like a child on time-out). He pulled up a chair and got me a menu, and took good care of me from then on. Zakery K is his name, and I'll probably just ask for him in the future and sit down at the bar to cut out the middleman of standing in the corner like a dunce. Food has been good, and I'll be back; hopefully, however, they'll get this whole ""organized, procedural service"" thing nailed down ere my next visit occurs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lakewood-8,,,,,

On 12.19.15 around 4pm My friends and I went out to get some drinks after doing some Christmas shopping. We sat at a table next to the bar after waiting 15 minutes and not having anyone come assist us. Finally the waiter, Devon or something like that came to give us menus. He asked if we wanted water, lemonade or a pepsi but no Margaritas or drinks. He gave us attitude when we asked about the happy hour details and any new drinks they had going on. He told us he ""didn't have the details and didn't know where to find them so we were out of luck"". Our waiter was extremely rude. Not only did he not take our order correctly but he kept walking away as we were still ordering... He never brought our second order of drinks that we asked for and never came back for us to order food. We found a flyer on a table next to us advertising that ""if they didn't offer us a Perfect Margarita then it was on them."" So when the manager came by we brought it to her attention. She took down the order for 3 Perfect margaritas but we only received 2. Then our waiter came by to try and argue with us that he had offered the margarita so he was going to charge us for them and not get the third. We asked for the manager and she told us she wouldn't charge but would not bring out the third margarita. This was the most sorry ass restaurant I have ever had the misfortune of entering.

One was a BBQ (meh), maple cream cheese (not bad, super sweet though), and the garlic aioli (YUM!!!). I ordered the quesadilla burger with fries. The burger was OK... not much flavor. I did not enjoy the fries, as they were crunchy and needed to be seasoned more. My hubby got the enchiladas and said it was ok. We ended with the churro s'mores. It was creative and pretty good!

Waitress went to correct their order. Brought us our daiquiri (yeah). Food was amazing kudos to the cooks!! Daiquiri tasted like a virgin quite disappointing.

I was a server for many years so I always try to take the servers side and understand how frustrating it can be at times, but this bartender/server was absolutely rude and made my night HORRIBLE! Worst experience! Lets begin with the fact that I ordered a margarita at the beginning of my dinner, as did the rest of the girls in my table. They all got their and I also asked for a water so he brings my water, no worries right he will bring my margarita, which I was not too worried about. But then he brings our food, at this point I don't want my margarita anymore so I don't bring it up, assuming he forgot about it....We are enjoying dinner, and none of us have any water or any drinks, we were trying to order a side of fries but he never came to check on us.... finally my husband asks if we can have water. He bring that as well as the bill (15 minutes later) we are about to pay and guess who has a margarita in her bill? THIS GIRL DOES!!! So my husband let's him know ""Hi I got charged for a margarita but you never brought it, if you could just please remove it""  the server then turns and looks at the table and says ""they all got their drinks who didn't get one?"" so i look at him and tell him its me he goes to his computer with an attitude and deletes it! DOESN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BRINGING THE MARGARITA OR ANYTHING!!! He actually tried to tell another customer i was just trying to get it for free!
