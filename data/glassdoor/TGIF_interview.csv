I emailed her once again and finally did the phone screen. No apologies for either mishap. She sent me a skills and personality test to complete online. The next week I was contacted by her to let me know I would be getting a phone call for my next step. I received a call from a restaurant GM asking me for a day to meet with him at his unit (55 miles from my home) for an interview. At the interview, this GM explained he was asked to do this for his boss but did not know why. He further explained that he had never done this before and apologized for his inexperience. After this interview, which did not go well, I walked away asking myself, ""What Just happened?"" The next day, I received a form email thanking me for my time but I was not going to be considered for the positiion. I sent an email to their home office asking if this was typical of their process. I received a phone call from an HR rep and was asked to explain my experience. Later that day, I received a phone call from the recruiter and got more of an excuse than an apology, and was told the district manager would be contacting me. When he did call me, I received an apology and we set up a time to meet. Because of the amount of time that had already passed, the position I had applied for was already filled but he would see what he could do. He said he would call me within one week to let me know about a decision. He never did so 3 days after the deadline HE set, I called him. To no surprise, he told me that I would not be joining the company. This whole fiasco took just over 3 months to complete!

I got a call a week later on a Saturday asking if I was still interested in a job and if I could come in for an interview the following monday. I interviewed with one of the managers and she just gave me the overview of the job (how the pay worked and the responsibility of the job) and also asked some questions about my availability and experience. I told her this would be my 1st job and she didn't really care that I didn't have experience. She called me back a few days later and asked if I could come in thursday for another interview with a different manager who asked more personal get to know you/work related questions. He said he'd call me back Friday if I got the job and sure enough I got a call that Friday.""]","[' Why should we hire you over the next person we interview? \xa0 ', '1 Answer', ' Because you will be working after school, are you willing to stay until 2 in the morning on the weekends? \xa0 ', 'Answer Question']"

The managers asked me how I solved problems, how well I got along with others, what motivated me, and what kinds of positive reinforcement I was used to. Friday's tries to find servers who can balance very different, individualized personalities with work ethic. It is the morale of the restaurant to have servers who do not conform to the restaurants way, but who complement the business's policies in their own way.
