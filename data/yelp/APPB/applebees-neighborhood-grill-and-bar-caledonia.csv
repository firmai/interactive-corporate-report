Amy M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",99,453,407,4.0,8/12/2017,"Stopped here with some friend before going to a movie across the street. We had prompt, friendly service.  I tried one of their new duos. Mozzarella sticks topped chicken breast with mashed potatoes & broccoli. I ate the mozzarella sticks & half of the rest of the meal & enjoyed all of it. The leftovers were great for lunch the next day too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-caledonia
Luke P.,"Hastings, MI",54,5,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Andy- Manager He is exceptionally rude and unfriendly to talk with. Today is the Lions playoff game. When the Lions fans at the bar cheer he comes out and not asks, but bitches for them to quiet down. Excuse us? This is the Lions and the Playoffs. When questioned he won't explain himself like an adult. He mumbles under his breath and then asks the bartender to quiet the bar area down.  This is not the first time. In understanding he has no respect from his staff either.  In my opinion to keep this restaurant in the good graces of our avid Detroit fans he needs a check and balance from his superior.  We hope to see a more happy and friendly Andy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-caledonia
Andrew B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",25,4,2,5.0,8/20/2017,Fun times with the family. Nice atmosphere. We come every once in awhile. We like the appetizers .. even better when it's half off!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-caledonia
Michael N.,"Chicago Loop, Chicago, IL",0,2,,5.0,9/4/2017,"This is my new favorite Applebees. I appreciate going somewhere that I have this very attentive service and attention to detail, as many of the servers and hostesses do. My favorite server there is Kandi, very informative and helpful with selections, and making sure your drink stays topped off. I always tip extra for service like this because of the extra mile. But one of the servers there named Tyler I believe was absolutely horrible, non-attentive, quiet, no check-in, no refills, overall a bad experience. Don't be a Tyler, be sweet like Kandi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-caledonia

Tisha W.,"Marion, IN",0,3,,1.0,11/5/2015,Service was great but food unsatisfactory.  Very small portions considering the price of the food.  My dish was a stir fry that had maybe 4 small vegetables so was mainly are rice and meat for 15 dollars. Small steak. Very un filling and very expensive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-caledonia

Oxana M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",1,10,,3.0,4/6/2014,"The food was typical for Applebee's menu, however, the lack of stars on my review goes to the poor  management. We've stopped by for a dinner around 5:30-6pm and all family members but my husband ordered a variety of burgers. That same night we got violently ill with food poisoning. My 20 month old (who had a bite of my burger, my 13 year old and myself). My husband had shrimp, chicken and rice and was fine. That being the last thing we've ate that night narrows it down to the hamburger meet that was used for our dishes. Called to report to them the next day and didn't even get a ""sorry"" from a (female manager I spoke on the phone) . The defensive reply was ""Well, we refrigerate our meat!"" Of course you do. Somehow, the well-done hamburgers got us sick and that means it was either not stored properly or not properly prepared since (according to manager) we were the only ones to get sick and report it. I was told she will look into that, but never asked for my phone number to follow up.   What a waste of money. Never going there again and reporting it to health department first thing Monday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-caledonia
Lacey L.,"Caledonia, MI",0,6,,5.0,8/18/2015,My family and I eat here a lot!  We always have great service and our food is always prepared exactly how we wanted it.  Sometime we do have to wait for a few min but never over 10 min.  We have a fairly large family.  We go on tue when the kids menus are cheaper that way they are more affordable which is a great option for families with many kids as we do!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-caledonia
Jennifer W.,"Grand Rapids, MI",43,56,,5.0,5/2/2009,"Since my initial review of this Applebee's location, it has become a regular place for us to go when we aren't looking for any surprises, just good food and a nice atmosphere.   We visit this Applebee's once a month, at least, and it is always a pleasure. I recommend the three cheese chicken penne, and the lime chicken.  Hubby tends to go for fish and chips.  The spinach artichoke dip is very good, as is the appetizer platter. For drinks, hubby recommends the Purple Rain, and I flip-flop between the sangrias, and the Main Street Rita Freezes... the Mango Strawberry swirl one is the bee's knees!   Mucho sized, of course! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-caledonia
