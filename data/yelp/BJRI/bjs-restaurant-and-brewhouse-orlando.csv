Jennifer R.,"Orlando, FL",2,12,,5.0,8/2/2017,"I never go to a restaurant and order pasta but the day I walked in and I saw the menu, the baked ziti was calling my name . Portion size was good the taste was great everything about my meal was awesome.  I also got a half and half skillet cookie peanut butter and cookies and cream I need to revisit soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando
Melinda P.,"Orlando, FL",44,122,337,2.0,1/7/2018,"A group of us met up here before hitting up David's Bridal to go dress shopping for one of my besties. I was looking for a place that had vegan options and BJ's has several plus of course items for everyone else in the party. When we first got there, all seemed well. The server was friendly and was checking on us regularly. However around halfway through the meal, this changed. She suddenly became unfriendly, seemed to have an attitude, and service was super slow. We were anxious because we were trying to make the dress appointment. We sat down just after 6 and the bride had to leave before we were all cashed out to get to the appointment at 7:30. We were a larger party, but I just felt like this was excessive.  As far as the food it was pretty good. The lentil soup I ordered was just okay. However, the portobello and asparagus salad was awesome! It had such a great flavor. I'd order that again for sure. I just don't think I'd return to this location since the service was spotty in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando
Amber F.,"Orlando, FL",49,46,47,3.0,1/5/2018,"Met part of my bridal party here for dinner before dress shopping at David's Bridal, which is super close. Our appointment was at 7:30, so I made us a reservation at BJ's for 6 thinking that should be plenty of time. When our waitress first came up, I was excited because she was pleasant and seemed on top of it. Some of our party was a little late, but only about 15 minutes.  Three of the party ordered salads, and they came out about 20 minutes before any of the other food, which started trickling out about 7:05. I had the avocado egg rolls as my main course and a side of fries. My food was just ok... nothing to rave about.  As soon as we sat down, our waitress assigned us numbers based on who was paying together. I thought it was a great idea and thought it would make the check process go smoothly. I was wrong. There were 9 of us total (6 different checks) and three of the checks were all messed up. We didn't get our checks until about 7:20 (even though I made it a point to ask for them once the salads came out). Overall, I was pretty disappointed and it'll be awhile before I go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando
Heather C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",312,401,149,3.0,1/3/2018,"Okay.... the menu is HUGE.   I finally settled on a salad that came out looking like an art deco masterpiece.  There were dried onions balanced high on top of a huge heaping pile of salad and chicken and it reminded me of JENGA.   Carefully removing the ""art project"" I was delighted to take the first bite of this delicious salad with chicken. (It was the Santa Fe BTW)   Super yummy and while we were sitting waiting for our order to arrive, momma said we should download the app so that we could receive a cookie and ice cream yummy dessert for free.  YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAS. Although I did not partake in eating the cookie deliciousness treat, it looked yummy enough and hey...  whats wrong with FREE again?  NA-DA!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando

Stephanie G.,"Orlando, FL",105,56,121,5.0,10/3/2017,"Believe it or not it's my 2nd time eating at a BJ's. EVER! I've been missing out! Wine is 1/2 off on tues. If you download they app you can claim a mini pizooike. Byron was our server and was fantastic! I had the mediterranean chicken tacos and a strawberry mojito. Those tacos were full of flavor and on what seemed to be a pita instead of a floor tortilla or hard shell. Wasnt expecting that at all, but it was genius. I absolutely loved them. There's were a total of two and were filling. The drink was made with love because I definitely tasted the alcohol. NOT COMPLAINING. Lastly, the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie. It's a warm baked chocolate chip cookie served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's a MUST.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando
Val D.,"Orlando, FL",178,61,145,3.0,12/16/2017,"Ordered the Santa Fe Salad, DO NOT ORDER THIS. Was very displeased. Overly dressed in their ""southwest dressing"". The dressing was not good to start with. And the chicken was dry.  My kids had the pepperoni flat bread, NOT life changing. And certainly did not taste good either. Also ordered the grilled cheese and it tasted funky. The butter they used to pan fry the bread had a weird after taste to it.  The ONLY good item they got right was the fries. Crunchy.  I will not be returning. Quality of food is poor and the prices are beyond what they reflect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando
Hieu L.,"Orlando, FL",184,219,1404,5.0,4/6/2017,"Had a great time here on a Thursday evening. TBH got home from work and a flyer caught my eye. Thursday baby back ribs all day special for $13.99 half rack and full rack $18.99 (prices not exact) and $5 dollar you call it! You bet! So got the ole Lady loaded up and off we went. Wasn't too busy, but there was a slight wait for dinning room. But of course no wait for the bar so we took a high top. I prefer the sports anyways on the multi screens of TVs. I preceded to order my full rack of ribs. Came with Caesar salad ( choice of Caesar, house, and one more can't remember) two sides, I got fries and veggies. Other options were mash potatoes, asparagus, brussel sprouts,pilaf rice and a few more. My girlfriend got her favorite Sirloin steak. And I went with bicardi and coke, thought I change it up a bit from my usual.  I would say I was quite impressed with the ribs. Although everyone loves fall off the bone. I like it from the bone get my hand dirtyyyy. It was very tender and glazed enough where I didn't need a pile of napkins. Same with the veggies cooked excellent. Nothing worse than soggy veggies. Almost forgot it came with desert. PIZOOKIE I believe it was called. I ordered the triple chocolate chocolate cookie and chocolate ice cream. Amazeballz!Overall great date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando
Sharon C.,"Atlanta, GA",244,301,1498,4.0,2/8/2017,"A few years ago, I would have said, meh, it alright.... This place is a step up from Ale House to me. Better look and feel. Nice bar area and it's a large place and so is the menu.  My fav here is definitely the salmon quinoa dish. Love it! I order this with zero salt each time and it tastes great!! The soy ginger salmon dressing is on the side as well. The dish is not bland at all and still tastes as if I never held the salt. Makes you think though. Just how much sodium a dish really has.  I've had a personal pizza here. Not a fan. If your going to serve any style of pizza make is delicious please. Otherwise, take if off the menu.  The service has always been great, funny servers, professional servers, all around great each time. The place is always clean. You can pay digitally now.  Also, sign up for their email list and get a free mini dessert. I had the salted caramel cookie which is served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

John C.,"Ormond Beach, FL",260,1256,3002,4.0,6/18/2017,"My daughter and I stopped at this location after she flew in to OIA.  We were looking for a place to eat and since we both know the Brewhouse and the menu we stopped here.  It did not disappoint.  The same menu, food quality and flavor as in Daytona (our home base).  We sat outside and enjoyed the Florida evening weather.  The wait staff was great and friendly.  The pizza was very filling and we had half a pizza as leftovers.  Watch your map as the location came up quick and you need to get over to get in to the shopping area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando
Debbie F.,"Orange Park, FL",170,394,1532,3.0,11/22/2017,On a whim we choose BJ's and I had not eaten at one before. The menu was extensive with so many choices. Everything to percentage out at about $15.00. I was not real hungry at the time and just wanted a small meal with a salad. Salads are a upcharge with a entrée so  I was heading toward $20.00 for my meal that I really didn't want. I ended up with soup and salad adding a side of grilled chicken. It was perfect combo for me. My husband just had to have MEAT so he ordered the special Prime Rib dinner for $29.00. It looked plentiful but he had no leftovers except the dessert which we shared with our table. The restaurant looks like a elegant upscale sports bar. Their were several large parties going on with large tables so this says how big the place is. My overall was it fits everyone's appetite but this would not be my first choice for me. I may need to come back when they run some specials and try again soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando
Aimee B.,"Ocoee, FL",116,139,105,4.0,8/31/2017,This is another of my lunch favorites.  I have a friend who is vegetarian so she is a huge fan of this place since even she has at least 5 different options.  There is a wide variety of food to cover anyone in your group.  This visit I opted for the Shrimp & Arugula pita tacos.  It was even better than I thought it was going to be with lots of flavor in the vinaigrette on the dish as well.  This visit my friend ordered the lentil soup and margarita flatbread for the pick 2 lunch special.  All of the lunch items are of good value and the service has been consistent for me when I have been there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando

Michelle C.,"Washington, DC",112,259,148,3.0,8/1/2017,"I came here with a big group and even though we had a pleasant dinner experience (servers were quick, food was delivered fresh and expediently), I was disappointed that we made a reservation and still had to wait 30 mins after we arrived for them to be prepared. The whole point of a reservation is for the table to be ready without a wait! The food itself was good, but I'm a little skeptical if it was all fresh. I have a hunch that much of it came frozen at some point. Still, the servers were kind and I think they did the best they could.

Gia N.,"Ocoee, FL",98,22,50,1.0,7/29/2017,"This restaurant is poorly managed and quite a few servers are poorly trained. There is no sense of urgency nor proactivity. We briefly saw what may have been two managers to assist in the seating of a lobby full of guests. Which there was no need for since it was only 2:25 pm and the restaurant had no more than 20  tables full. It amazes me that the fry cook thought that it was a good idea to fry French fries in the same oil as churros, while that would have been fine if frying sweet potato fries to add to the sweetness of the sweet potatoe fries it was not a pleasant taste for regular fries. As a former restaurant manager and secret shopper I observed many issues during our time in the restaurant which was mostly unhappy patrons complaining of food incorrect in some way or the food coming out cold. I also observed a drink runner putting her face very close to a beer to sniff it  for some unknown reason as she was on the way to deliver it to a guest. I think it's time to clean house. The only server worth saving is Travis because you can tell he enjoys what he does and he does it well in a friendly,timely, and efficient manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=40
Bob D.,"Orlando, FL",1,76,7,2.0,9/17/2016,You get what you pay for. They have a good selection of beer. Once I found the one I like I always buy it. the 12 - 16  or so beers have are so varied that I believe the idea is you will hit on one you like and stick with it. The food for the most part takes like heated precooked food from a food distributor.  The salad is safe and so is the fish and chips. This is not a go to place for food - at least not for me. The location is good to meet friends form the other part of town. If not I would never go here again. There are a lot of BJs  so they are doing something right for someone . I think they found a market with those who can find something for everyone. They offer pasta to salad to steak - a little a everlasting. Maybe that is why nothing really stands out as great or rather good food. It fills your belly and STOP! Bob,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=40

Crystal R.,"Orlando, FL",532,277,930,4.0,1/20/2015,"BJ has a great selection of food, their menu reminds me of cheesecake factory. Considering I am living a healthier life style these days, I love the variety of options they have when it comes to healthy food choices. I opted for the Chicken Mediterranean Tacos which were served on pita bread. The dish was refreshingly flavorful. For an appetizer I ordered the avocado egg rolls, which are superb. I have this love affair with avocado and anybody who does will absolutely love their rolls. My daughter ordered the Jalapeño burger which was huge and apparently delicious. Pretty much if you are in the mood for a good beer, BJ'S is your place as well. Like I said the variety on the menu is great anywhere from pizza,fish, and pasta.

I hadn't been to BJ's in at least 6 years, maybe 7, so I thought why not. My husband and I sat at the busy bar and we were greeted immediately by the pleasant bartender. The beers that are exclusive to their restaurant are delicious.  We chose to leave and eat somewhere else for a few reasons. The bar had a horrible stench to it. I'm guessing it was because I was sitting by the taps and maybe it was the drain? I just couldn't think about eating my dinner and smelling that horrible smell. The 2nd thing that bothered me was that the manager was sitting at the bar next to me working on the staff schedule or something on a laptop.  These things won't deter me from never coming back.

We ordered a number of apps and a couple small salads to get a taste of this big menu. The watermelon and beet & arugala salads were both very tasty. The fried artichoke was ok, a bit disappointing.

Cecille R.,"Apopka, FL",537,960,3425,4.0,6/30/2014,Some friends and I were looking to grab a meal in the area and this one fit the bill. I haven't been in years and I forgot how massive the restaurant is. It wasn't packed so we got a booth immediately with no problems.  Our waiter was very friendly. He told us they brewed their own beers there and also offered up samples of ciders that I was on the fence about.  I ended up ordering the southern fried chicken which came with white cheddar mashed potatoes and a corn/veggie succotash. It was actually really good. I loved that it was a boneless chicken so no bones to deal with. One friend ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and her only complaint was that she requested that the sun dried tomatoes be taken off her dish but they didn't do so she had to pick them off.   Another friend ordered a mini pizza (free with purchase of a drink and when checking in on Foursquare) and a side salad and seemed to be happy with.  Our server did push the BJ's rewards card(completely free) which allows you to earn rewards with every visit . He did mention that one of the perks of the card is that you can preorder your meal before even getting to the restaurant so that when you get to the restaurant the server will immediately come out with your meal!

Lisa N.,"Orlando, FL",152,316,1241,3.0,3/16/2016,"We were driving home from Hollywood Studios to downtown Orlando and decided to stop by BJ's for dinner since we had a 10% discount offer. This was a terrible idea on a Saturday night because the traffic coming off I-4 to I Drive was crazy. Considering that we were in prime tourist land, I shouldn't have been as surprised as I was by how packed the restaurant was at 9pm. My boyfriend is from California and has been to the original BJ's but it was my first time so we had to get the classic dishes that BJ's is known for: deep dish pizza and a pizookie. I also ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms. Service was good although our waitress didn't look as though she enjoyed her job very much. The food came out pretty quickly. I thought the mushrooms were okay but not my favorite. I really just need to stop ordering stuffed mushrooms in general because the menu description is always more appealing to me than the actual dish. On the other hand I wasn't that excited about the pizza initially and it was fantastic. We had the BJ's Favorite and it was loaded with toppings. I was pleasantly surprised that the crust was quite light for being a deep dish. We ordered a small which is 6 slices and were full after 2 each. At that point I didn't really have much room for dessert but we still got a pizookie anyway because I couldn't leave without trying it. I thought we'd end up taking some home but OMG it was so delicious. One bite and I was hooked. We had the cookies 'n' cream and it tasted just like a gourmet Oreo. I will happily return to BJ's to try more of the pizookies and the food's pretty good too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=60

Sorry all I can't recall what name it was, but this burger did have mayo, pile of onion straws and BBQ sauce plus-plus,  and somehow the standards in there too. Yeah, best to attack this delicious feast between two toasted sauce suckers while sitting with elbows extended and cross legged lying on the floor.

Charlotte S.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",123,119,37,1.0,1/4/2016,"Usually I'm in love with this place. They serve the best broccoli cheddar soup in town. It comes in a delicious garlic bread bowl, which I crave every time I come here. The downside: Apparently they only serve select soups on certain days, which I wasn't aware of. I ordered the broccoli cheddar as usual and when it came, it tasted WAY off. It definitely wasn't the soup I ordered so I asked the waiter and he said they don't do broccoli cheddar soup on [insert day here] so he gave my clam chowder instead! He didn't even ask or tell me.  I am obviously not a fan of any seafood so I immediately sent it back. That is not how you do business, especially if someone could have had an allergy. Thankfully I was not one of those people but it was still frustrating nonetheless.

Tonight, I arrived with my husband around 10pm. First of all, it was a good while before we actually even saw our server, but once we did, she was the sweetest person. Still, the problems with tonight were 1) took forever for our food to arrive at our table considering the place was pretty empty when we ordered, 2) no linens (which our server so sweetly apologized for), so we just got little brown napkins and 3) a piece of paper was mixed in with the lettuce I put on top of one of our sliders, which I realized immediately once I bit into it. Definitely not the best experience! I wanted to say something, but our server was so nice and I didn't want to look like I was just looking for something free, to be totally honest.

I'm a beer person and seeing as BJ's brews their own beers felt compelled to try it! I decided on a layered beer, their red beer layered with their stout. It was good, not great. My girlfriend had the ""Pink Cadillac"" martini. She complained that she couldn't taste any alcohol in it. We ordered the calamari and chicken avocado flat bread for our snack.  It took a very long time. Once it did arrive, we were both dissatisfied. Barely any actual chicken on flat bread and more crust than toppings. Calamari rather than being fried crisp and breaded was soggy and soaked with grease.

When he finally took the time to take me order he was extremely cold and unwelcoming as if he hated to have any customers there at all. I proceeded to ask him about late night happy hour or any specials and je went over the specials quickly. I felt extremely mistreated when the patron he was speaking with at bar mentioned the way we were being treated, even he noticed it and couldn't help but comment on it by saying: ""wow what a way to greet guest"" adding to that more comments as to how he treats his customers at his own bar when they come in, the bartender just laughed it up and at that point we felt so disgusted by it all and cancelled our order and left in such disbelief that anyone like that is in the industry.

I went with the half flatbread and salad special. The salad is a mix of baby greens, carrots, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes topped with a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad is very small and so is the flatbread so if you are super hungry don't go for this. However, it was the perfect size for what I wanted. For the flatbread, I went with the California Club which consisted of chicken, bacon, tomatoes, mozarella and avocado and it was topped with a delicious garlic sauce. Loved it! Wouldn't mind trying this again for a light lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=120

David M.,"Orlando, FL",122,224,,3.0,11/2/2013,"I recently visited BJ's for a business lunch at the suggestion of two colleagues and then followed up with a dinner with my son.  BJ's has a sports bar feel (almost) but a far more extensive menu than most sports bars.  Unfortunately, with so much on the menu, the menu can be hit or miss. On each of my visits, I ordered salmon.  The first visit was a great experience and the salmon was among the best I have had outside of a fine dining environment.  The second visit gave me pause, however, because the salmon was a bit undercooked and seemingly flavorless.  I suppose I should go back for a third visit to determine which version of the salmon is the real thing, but the unappetizing experience of my second visit gives me pause. When I dined with my colleagues, they ordered a flat bread and a soup, respectively.  Both were good but unremarkable.  They enjoyed their meals but did not rave about the great experience that they were having.  Perhaps that is the nature of meals with colleagues but I found it telling. Curiously, my son loved his experience (and has since returned), ordering steak both times.  He has repeatedly suggested that we return. Thus it is that I give BJ's 3 stars but I hope that with the passage of time I will return and BJs will earn a 4th star by proving that my most recent visit was a forgivable anomaly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=120

The menu offered a great variety of food and some interesting twists on basics. Overall though the food was average, as you'd expect from a chain restaurant.  I ordered the bison burger which had a great taste, but the side of slaw that was supposed to have a spicy dressing seemed like cabbage with a dry spice...it was bizarre.

Ryan K.,"Orlando, FL",227,219,82,4.0,12/1/2012,"BJ's has a little bit of everything. Their menu is vast; this is true for both food and beer. It is upscale for a sports bar and is humongous inside.  If you're an indecisive person, it may take you an hour just to settle on something considering the novel-ish size of the menu (yes, novel-ish is a word, I created it just to describe this menu). I have yet to find something I didn't enjoy here.....from their hamburgers to their salads, their pizzas and pastas, and even their mac n cheese.....all winners in my book. On a recent visit I found myself sitting at the bar and deep into a convo about beer with the bartender, John. I was surprised at how knowledgeable and passionate he was about beer, something I wasn't expecting at a chain. He gave me some recommendations after I explain what I typically drink and he was spot on. FUN FACT: They have half priced apps and pizza during any football game at bar area which has booths, high tops, and bar seating. GOOD FOR GROUPS: A few months back a friend had a birthday dinner here and our one waiter handled the 12 of us without issue. He was slightly pushy when it came to the drinks but that is somewhat to be expected.   BJ'S, IF YOU""RE READING: Bring back that opened faced meatloaf sandwich!!!! It had mashed potatoes, delicious gravy, and crispy onions.  You have 500 things on your menu, why not 501?

David K.,"Orlando, FL",69,86,464,4.0,3/20/2011,"Fellow Yelpers, This place has a lot going for it, it is in a good location and a nice establishment that looks fun.  The interior is wildly decorated, a mix of Ale House with TGI Friday's.  If TGI Friday's decor went to a formal event, it would dress up as BJ's.  The service at first was disappointing because I think we were mistakenly sat in a section of the restaurant where the server was on a break because it took 15 minutes for anyone to come up to our table. Eventually service came around and we placed our orders.  I had the Wedge Salad and the Pork Chops.  The Salad didn't seem well put together but it tasted good although it was drenched in bleu cheese dressing.  The Pork Chops were great, cooked fairly well.  It was accompanied by white cheddar mashed potatoes, green beans and sweet apples.   Overall I would recommend this place to others for a quick bite during the night more so than the day.  It just seems like a fun night dinner with a group of friends atmosphere.  This is a brewery so you can choose their own selection of beers.  Not a place for a special night out.

Tonight we tried the Smores pizookie and it has scorched gooey marshmallows on it...so luscious! I suppose one very hungry person could eat a whole one, but it's nice for two people to share it since it's a lot of dessert.  Also like the handcrafted speciality sodas (root beer, black cherry, cream soda and orange cream) that are made with beet sugar and no artificial ingredients.

I've been going to this chain since I was a kid in LA, and later in Phoenix and always enjoyed it. In Florida I have been unusually unhappy with the food and/or the service. Tonights issue was the food. Our server was great! First off, we were seated immediately and we got our drinks in no time. Made it just under the deadline for half-price appetizers, so we went with Carnitas Fries and Spinach Artichoke Dip. The portions were so huge we didn't even bother getting anything else to eat.  The chips for the dip were greasy and the dip had a weird texture from the cream cheese used that wasn't creamy, but more chalky. There was a lack of flavor and of spinach and artichokes so it was just mediocre. The fries however had a pretty good green chile and cheese that was nice, but the carnitas were darned good. Not a bad dish, and with the half off deal it was really a great price.  The one constant for me here is always the micro-brewed root beer. It's full of deep flavor and has this aftertaste that my wife finds off-putting but that I just love. It stays on my palate for a moment with an earthy, sort of licorice flavor that I just really love.  These restaurants look so nice, but I just can't ever seem to have a better than average experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=20

The spinach stuffed mushrooms with lemon squeezed atop absolutely delicious!! A coworker order the Bison burger w/ Cole slaw with  sriracha sauce for the side.. pass on the slaw. It was more of a side salad with sriracha drizzled on top. Another dish was a slab of ribs. The ribs had a crispness to it which was a great touch as the meat was tender and tasteful. The broccoli they served with it was practically raw and dry. Pass on the broccoli or you will be disappointed. Another dish was the grilled Mahi tacos, they were very tasty as well.

I had the mushroom burger with their veggie patty and also a side of fries. The burger came with pesto and a special sauce that may have been sour cream based as well as a portobello mushroom that was grilled with grilled onions and a slice of cheese melted on top. It is a mouthful, and tastes very good. BJs fried are especially good, crispy and salty and seem to have been dipped in a batter before frying. They remind me a little of Belgium fries.

This visit was for meeting up with some coworkers to say goodbye to a fellow employee who was leaving our company.  I showed up at around 5:30 pm and nobody from the group was there so I got a drink at the bar.  The bar was full so I just stood at the end and got my drink and sat down at one of the tables in the bar area.   In a few min, my group showed up and we all got a table.  The server was nice but was a bit pushy with food.  We came for just drinks and some appetizers but even after telling her this, she continued to suggest main dishes for us to order.  I guess her tactics worked since the group did order more food than they were going to do! I stuck to my two cocktails because I did not have extra money or time to order food.  I could only stay an hour and knew from the past the amount of time it would take to get food.  To my surprise, their food only took about 30 min to come out.  Everybody liked what they ordered and said it was fine.  For me, my challenge this time was that they lost my credit card when I went to pay for the meal.  They were not sure if it got misplaced or was given to another person!  After about 10 min of searching, they discovered it hidden under another card they had up at the bar.  Again, there is always something that happens when I go there so I think it is just me!

shannon c.,"Centreville, VA",4,11,,2.0,2/6/2016,"Our family eats at BJ's all the time.  Tonight was our first visit to this location (Conroy Rd.), and I can say it'll likely be our last.  We began by ordering drinks and an appetizer, but never got silverware or small plates and had to ask around before finally getting these things from the hostess stand instead of a server.  Our server, Christie T., was incredibly slow, and extremely rude to say the least.  Based on the temperature of our meals the food was obviously sitting in the kitchen for a while before being delivered to our table.  The restaurant was not busy and appeared to be fully staffed, so there was no just cause for our meals being delivered in such an untimely fashion.  Our server never asked how our meals were either, nor did she refill 2 of the 4 drinks at the table.  I would have asked for a refill had she come by the table other than to bring our semi warm food, but unfortunately that didn't happen.  I wish we hadn't had such a terrible experience because this BJ's is a lot closer to our house than the Kissimmee location, but for better service I'm willing to drive an extra 5 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=140

They brew their own beer there and they're great. I suggest the 8 beer sampler. It's a good amount of beer for about $12 and you can try all the different types. Service is good too.

We had some drinks and made a dinner out of a whole bunch of appetizers, did it family style. The staff were very friendly and fun. We ate and drank for hours.  We mostly drank beer. Did a lot of BJ's own brews. I can't remember what mine was called, but they said it was the closest BJ Brew to Newcastle.  We got the spinach artichoke dip, the chicken lettuce wraps, the avacado egg rolls, the crispy calamari, the santa fe spring rolls, the crisp potato skins, and motzarella sticks. 4 of us shared them and drank beer. It was a wonderful evening. Why 3 stars? Well it is a chain. And we did not try anything crazy or exceptional. We enjoyed each other's company more than the food, but we had to fill our tummies with something other than beer. I was tempted to do 4 stars because we had such a good time, but that would not really be fair, because it would not based on the food and service and would not be helpful to other Yelpers.  However, I give you my word, all of the appetizers i listed are wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=140

If you're a fan of beers, there is a good selection (don't expect World of Beer, but good) and you'll find all the American classics on the menu. The pizza really is pretty good, too. My favorite time to go is during NFL games when there is an automatic happy hour. That's a dollar off beers and half priced appetizers.

Louis L.,"Tuckerton, NJ",4,145,,3.0,10/25/2015,"A 2nd visit in a week boosted this place from 1* to 3.On Mon pm 10/19,we stopped in after just landing to town,and were please that all night was NFL specials w/MNF on.The bar area was the only side really open and we were happy to watch the (100""?) tv and looked fwd to half price apps and discounted drinks. Opting for some BJ`s brews and my DW the microbrew cream (excellent btw) soda, we realized our waitress,a brunette,while nice was seriously overwhelmed by 2 group tables and whatever booths she had to share with the other (blond) waitress.In the old days,one would feel bad for an overworked waitress,however,in the `chain days`, these 2 waitresses had 2 asst waiters bussing and serving the meals for them. So,it was amazing to me that we (thankfully) ordered our apps w/drinks and receievd them.We advised server that we would be ordering `food` as well. She disappeared. Only when prompted by the asst bussers did she return to fill our empty glasses and take the balance of our order. Even after ordering,she took long to get our rounds. Food quality good,service by this young woman was awful. PS-the mozz sticks were some of the BEST we ever had. --------- Roll fwd to giving this place another shot a few days later: While it was only 2pm,usually a dead time in dining,there were people at the bar and dining.. We like not to be the only ones.  We caught some great lunch specials and food quality,and Bev quality good to vg. What made the day was our cutie server Joann.She was very personable, quick w/refill and pleasant to speak with.We are not locals,but if we were we would go just to see her. We try to hit up BJs in our frequent travels,as we do not have them home. We appreciate the food quality is usually way better than `normal` chains and the brews. We suggest they train the other waitress better or staff up higher during football. In all,if MNF was our only visit it would be a 1*. Our 2nd visit would stand alone at 4*.

Service is ALWAYS spot on - just enough and not too much.  The ambiance is very nice too, with them playing top 100 music in the background.  In fact I find myself saying often ""Wow - I love that song!.""   It's like an upscale TGIF but way better if I had to describe it.  And it's big so you typically don't have to wait for a table (though I always eat at the bar as they have that HUGE TV WALL and the bartenders are always so cool). It's fun, pretty affordable, well laid out, and TASTY.  You won't want to skip the treadmill after this however - good luck ordering anything ""lite"" as it is, like it's sister the Cheesecake Factory, a total calorie whore.  Seriously - 1lb loaded to the nines baked potatoes are on the menu and they're HUGE.  But I'll gladly live down my Jeramiah Red beer buzz running a 5k later tonight in trade for that delish grilled cheese and tomato soup.   YUM",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=180

It's a giant cookie (they have a few different varieties) served hot in a skillet with ice cream on top. Yeah not the most gourmet or fancy but it's pretty darn good.  Another plus is that if you're a sports fan they have lots of different games on to watch. So chances are if your team is playing you can watch them.  The rest of this restaurant is just a typical chain.  The service is just mediocre and is really luck of the draw. One night I was here and it was pretty busy and was in a large party and the service was good. One night it was just me and a friend and the place was no busy and the waiter provided minimal service.  The food is alright. I've never had something bad but I've never had anything that I consider amazing.  I was excited to try their cider, but the taste was really flowery and I'm not sure I'd order it again.

Joe C.,"Orlando, FL",62,366,114,4.0,12/14/2010,"BJ's is a good solid restaurant - especially for a chain. The interior is huge and open. Tables are spaced apart enough so that you never feel like you're cramped next to your neighbors.  Decorations are nice, but generally unremarkable.  The food is where they really shine. While most of it tops out at ""pretty good"", I've found that their meat loaf with onion strings (both the regular entree and the open face sandwich) is out of this world. Most of their dishes are large enough to split up and take home an entire second meal. The meatloaf and the parmesan crusted chicken (served over spaghetti which is a little dry, ask for extra sauce) are great examples of this.  While the company brews their own beer, I believe it's all shipped into this location. The ones I've tried have all been decent. They offer a flight so you can try them to find the one you like best.  Service here can be hit-or-miss. Servers are very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu - but it seems that they put their tables all around the restaurant. It may be a while before they get back to you. On our last visit, a large table full of Yelpers (who had also just come from  an Elite event across the street) was monopolizing our server's time while we were trying to finish up and get our check.  Of course, one can't review this place without mentioning the revolving door at the entrance. It's fun.

Jalissa S.,"Chicago, IL",4,8,24,4.0,7/5/2014,"Tonight was my first experience with this restaurant, and I was impressed! I had the jambalaya, and I thought it was scrumptious. My only complaint about the dish itself was the rice. It was as if they tossed the rice in a oil/butter pan prior to putting it on a plate. At first I thought it may be the sauce, but it didn't seem so. The combination of shrimp, chicken, and sausage was appreciated to this cajun/creole fan. I got to sample the House Sirloin that my company had, and the steak was cooked perfectly. Very tender and nicely seasoned. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were also a delight. They weren't extremely cheesy, which was a plus to me. In the end, I would definitely come here again. Our server was as sweet as the lady at the front. He was a true gentleman. It is a little pricy (steak entree: $13.50 | jambalaya: $16.50), but worth it when you have good service and atmosphere... Speaking of atmosphere, it is comfortably lit in there. The eclectic, industrial feel to the decor was super pleasing to the eye and they have a variety of televisions for sports fans to enjoy.

Libby W.,"Orlando, FL",504,296,74,4.0,4/7/2010,"Same great food as the other Orlando location but with better service.  We started off with a beer, I had the red ale and loved it also their new amber beer is also a good choice. I love their beers here, they are not brewed on property but they are brewed in Las Vegas, kegged and then shipped over here. I also love that they have the pairing info right on the menu so you can see what beer goes with what entree.  For our appetizer we had the avocado rolls with the tamarind sauce. Large rolls filled with wonderful large chunks of avocado was brought to the table. I loved the crunch of the roll paired with the softness of the avocado.  I noticed that they recently rolled out some new menu items, starter app type items that are good to share, or good for a snack for one. I think next time I'm going to have to try one.  We decided we were in a pizza mood and ordered the deep dish cheese burger pizza. I really enjoyed the crust, its not dry at all, it actually seems a bit buttery with notes of garlic. The toppings were great and it wasn't overwhelming like you were eating a mess of piled high cheese burgers. The flavor was more subtle but I really enjoyed it.  my glass was never empty and I actually knew we had a server at this location. The hunters creek location needs to take notes on better service from this location.  Also I'm curious about why there are hunky beef cake photos of men wearing barely nothing in the women's bathroom, and am equally curious if there are photos of scantily clad women in the men's restroom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=200

Our server was very attentive...almost annoyingly so.  But he did his job very well. The food was surprisingly good too - thai shrimp lettuce wraps for an appetizer; a turkey burger on sourdough; and for me, an enormous loaded baked potato with fresh (no, really, they were fresh!) vegetables, two types of cheese, and alfredo sauce which I asked to be given on the side, 'cause I really didn't feel like having a heart attack right there at the table.  It was filling and delicious, and I even had some left over.  It's too bad I can't use my hotel mini-fridge because it's stocked to the brim with liquor and soda we're not allowed to drink! Onto the beer.  Very nice selection, all seemed kinda mild.  We tried a hefewizen, a porter, a red, a blonde ale (all house brews), and some other belgian-style beer which my husband commented went down much more smoothly than expected.  The ""drinkability"" factor was very high with all these beers.  Always a plus. I also noticed they brew their very own berry cider. The best part was how affordable everything was.  A four-beer sampler was only six bucks.  The potato was HUGE (I'm talking main course all by itself), and it was just $8.  I even got a fruity mixed drink (peachy keen sangria), which in any chain restaurant would go anywhere from $10-14, and at BJ's it was only $5.95.  Not bad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=200

Pete D.,"Rockville, MD",11,185,70,3.0,5/1/2010,"This place reminded me of a local chain near home and the Cheesecake Factory because of its pretty extensive menu.  Wifey and I were talking about the decor and they put a lot of money into it.  From the LCD panels across the restaurant, to the garage doors, the large booths, and their nice looking bar area.  We stopped in here for lunch and arrived basically when they opened, 11:00 AM.  There were already a few tables, but we were nicely greeted and seated right away.  The sever came by and took our drink orders.  I read from another Yelper, they brew their own root beer in-house.  I normally never order root beer, but what the heck, let's try it.  This was very refreshing and I was a root beer fan (just for the time I was there). For our food, I started off with the chili, which is made with their Piranha Pale Ale beer.  The chili was alright, wasn't a huge fan.  It was missing ""filling,"" as it didn't have enough meat and beans.  As for the main attraction, I went with their famous deep dish pizza.  Kind of odd because we aren't in Chicago, but I'm glad the server recommended it.  The pizza dough was delicious!!  I got the Bj's classic (I think that's what it is, basically a ""surpreme"" pizza).  The only pitfall was that the toppings fell off, but I could careless.  I used my hands, put it right back on the dough and chomped away.  Wifey had the spaghetti with meat sauce.  I didn't expect too much out of it and after a taste it was decent.  A generous portion, along with some pieces of garlic bread. The service was good, couldn't complain at all as the server checked on us frequently and refilled our water cups.  The prices here are good and rather normal for this type of cuisine.  I noticed there are a handful of Bj's Restaurant and Brewhouse in FL (read my other review for the one in Pinellas Park).  A solid 3.5 star.  This is a great place to catch a game, have a brew, eat some good food, and relax.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=200

Went back here tonight for dinner and it still was just as good as before. Tonight I had their Pear Cider - wow. REALLY good. I also got their Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad but instead of fried chicken, I substituted for grilled chicken. Besides the fact that they are VERY generous in their portion size (I think I could make 3 meals out of the leftovers!), this salad impressed me.

Adam P.,"Toronto, Canada",25,120,80,4.0,9/30/2009,"Yet another chain I didn't realize was a chain, I thoroughly enjoyed BJ's. The decor is modern trendy without being pompous, and yet there is a huge (and I mean huge) tv over the bar area that is visible to all tables. This would be a great place to watch any sports game without the feel of a sports bar. Being a sucker for wheat beer, I ordered the BJs version of it and my wife and I both thought it was really good. Now on to the menu. Being from Canada I had to ask the waiter what the local favorites were and was directed to the area of the pizzas and the baked potatoes. The guy made a huge deal about the size of the potatoes. He said they were the largest potatoes I've ever seen. Stay tuned for the conclusion of that story. My wife ordered the buffalo wing pizza and I fell to the waiters selling techniques and got a baked potato with chicken and alfredo sauce. Before our dinners we though we'd try their sampler appetizer platter. What a mistake that was. Not because it was terrible, on the contrary, it was really good. The problem was the thing was so huge we were full and didn't have much of an appetite for dinner. When dinner came out I was actually a bit disappointed at the size of the baked potato. The guy did qualify that if it wasn't impressive then he'd get two potatoes on there. Although this potato was big, he conceded this was smaller than he was expecting and offered to get me another one. Since I was already not hungry I declined. The potato was good, and if you are a little nervous about getting alfredo sauce on your potato it won't be an intrusive as a taste as you think. Not to forget the pizza, we both thought it was really good although we couldn't give an accurate enjoyment reading because we were so full.

It looked busy but we were seated right away.  The table we were seated at had the brightest lights ever.  After we ordered, we asked out server if the lights could be dimmed. It seemed all the other light except for  the lights in our row of tables were dimmer and created a better lighting to eat by not to get a sunburn. We then told the person that brought our food out that we would like the lights dimmed since it hadn't been done yet. When our server stopped by to check on our food, we asked about the lights a third time. He said the manager was trying to figure it out. Eventually we were moved to a different table & ready to try to enjoy our food. I had a salad which was pretty good as salads good. It had chicken fingers & a nice honey mustard dressing.  My husband got the fish & chips.  He thought the fish was greasy & not very good. The beer was the best thing this place seemed to have going.  We were not checked on again for him to comment on the fish or even asked when our plates were cleared if everything was ok.

My personal favorite is the grilled chicken pasta.  The grilled chicken is always super tender and juicy, never tough and dry like chicken you get at most large chain restaurants.  Although deep dish pizza is their specialty, the others on the menu are delish' too.

Available with grilled chicken, Cajun shrimp, flame-broiled or blackened salmon.)  You'd think that being in Florida this dish is probably so packed full of nutrients and flavor.  It was not good.  The vegetables really tasted like they were canned.  MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. My boyfriend opted for the deep dish pizza.  Another gross encounter.  It was so oily and there wasn't much too it.  You know how onion rings have that fried outer layer?  It tasted just like the outer layer. Mom tried a healthy option too and went for the low cal Creole Tilapia (Oven roasted tilapia topped with a tomato olive tapenade and served with rice pilaf, baby greens tossed in our balsamic vinaigrette and topped with shredded carrots, red onions, cucumbers and tomatoes.)  It was under 575 calories and tasted like it was.  My cousin went for this juicy cheeseburger and that actually looked good.  Like I said, go for the fattiest item and you'll probably be safe.  We had their traditional Oreo pizookie for dessert.  It's basically a huge cookie with some Oreo flavors and topped with vanilla ice cream.  Eh I've had better. As if the food wasn't bad enough, our server was so bad it was comical.  He seriously looked annoyed that he had to work.  Like it was a personal offense to him that we came to eat because he surely had better things to do.  We also put my newest little cousin in a highchair and the servers/bus boys kept bringing food and other things over her.  I thought her mom was going to have a heart attack every time someone walked by.

Dan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",436,973,42,5.0,1/9/2009,"What a surprise!  Who would have thought that in an area of tourist traps that there would be a genuine restaurant who gives you your money's worth in food?  To say BJ's menu is extensive would be an understatement.  The variety in their menu is not unlike Cheesecake Factory, although the food and the prices are admittedly far better here.   Walking toward the building, the aroma of above-standard food filled the air.  We walked in, and the place was full of people chattering away in a modern environment.  Despite the perceived fullness of the restaurant, 7 of us were sat pretty much right away.  We started with the avocado egg rolls.  I cannot begin to say how much those hit the spot.  After not having eaten all day due to work and school, these hot and crispy eggrolls with avocado, cream cheese, and other things that I did not bother identifying, really assuaged my ravenous hunger in a tasty way.  The sauce that you have for dipping is perfect.  Don't really know what it is to be honest with you.  It had an Asian flavor to it.  Almost like a duck sauce on crack.   For my meal, I ordered the Cajun pasta.  It was one of the best I have had.  Usually, Cajun pasta comes with a white and creamy sauce, but this one came with a red and creamy sauce.  The taste was awesome.  The chicken on it was grilled to perfection and surpassed my expectations in flavor.  Their use of cayenne pepper, paprika, and other cajun spices was wonderful.  My only critique is that I would have enjoyed it even spicier.   For dessert, we had the Party Pizookie.  The Pizookies are giant and soft cookies cooked and topped with ice cream.  They have six different kinds: chocolate chip, white chocolate chip, ghirardelli, oreo, peanut butter, and oatmeal/raisin.  With the party Pizookie, you get to choose 4 out of these 6 cookies.  We chose the first four I listed.  It was outstanding.  My favorite personally was the oreo, but everyone had a different favorite so...to each his own.   I also tried bites of the parmesan crusted chicken and a California Burger with fries.  Both were incredible.  The Parmesan Crusted Chicken came with a parmesan sauce and sat on a bed of mashed potatoes.  The California Burger came with avocado, green chilies, chipotle mayo, and ranch.  The fries were wedge shaped and very good.  Everything I tried there was good.  One thing's for sure: I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu.  This is one of those restaurants that you go to and find many things that you want to try, but alas, you only have 1 stomach; meaning you'll need to make several trips.   The atmosphere was great...the huge HD TVs make it a perfect place to watch sports games.  The service was about average.  The server was very cordial and friendly but could have been more attentive.  The food runner, busser, and server working together as a team made up for it in my opinion.  That kinda team work can be inspiring.  The appetizer was brought out lickety split, but both the entrees and the dessert took longer than expected.  It didn't tarnish our experience, however, because the food was great, it was relatively affordable, and we were in a great atmosphere with good company.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=220

From deep dish pizza, gourmet burgers, appetizer, gluten-free, and some Asian dishes (miso salmon, sauteed chicken, spring rolls). They also wide variety of seafood and steak for their entree as well as a low-car/cal menu section. I ordered the Miso Salmon: Sautéed with a miso citrus glaze and served with white rice, snow peas, carrots, red bell peppers and onions. I loved the rice. It was not American short grain, but jasmine rice with soy glaze flavor from the salmon. The salmon was a bit dry and overcooked, but portion size was on point. The veggies were stry-fried crispy just the way most asian dishes are. Definitely going back there again to try the pizza and their wide variety of brewed beers.

I have been there a couple of times and have sampled their French Dip, Pizza, and Hamburgers.  The best was the open face chili cheeseburger. I had to eat the whole thing with a knife and fork because they just pile the chili over the entire burger. Although this dish probably shot my cholesterol up through the roof, it was worth it! It was huge and by the time I was done I had to roll out of the place. The beer is excellent! I have had them all at one point or another, but I have to say the blond is my favorite. The do have a beer sampler on the menu, just don't be the designated driver if you get it. For desert, my wife and I always get the Pizookie, which is an 10 inch cookie (you can get chocolate chip or white chocolate chip) cooked in a pizza dish, topped with your choice of ice cream. Aside from food and beer, there are a ton of TV's in this place, so it is a great place to watch the game on Football Sundays.

Danyelle A.,"Orlando, FL",2,19,24,1.0,7/10/2014,"The 12 of us decided to go here for my brother's birthday, but the service and management was a complete disaster. I started off by giving them the benefit of the doubt because the waitress was training someone else, but the consistent inaccuracies and the comments that not only came from the servers, but the manager, appalled me! We have been to BJ's before and the food and drinks have always been good. I honestly can tell you that this was one of the worst service experiences of my life.  Firstly, they brought out waters and left them on the tray at another table, so they could take another order. After 10 minutes, we had to get up and grab our own drinks. Then, we ordered appetizers. After about 40-50 minutes, our main dishes started coming out with the appetizers. When we said we no longer needed the appetizers, the waitress told us it was the trainers fault because she ran them in, and it could have been a computer error.  About 7 of the 10 meals were incorrect, but we were so hungry at this point that we did not complain. That is, until the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad came out as regular lettuce with no Kale or Brussel sprouts. My friend nicely told the server about her salad and they brought out about 10 brussel sprouts to pour into her lettuce.  At this point, we were there for about 2 hours with no drinks, no appetizers, waitresses blaming the other person, our meals were wrong, the bathroom trash cans were overflowing, and the servers were standing around talking more than serving!  We decided to call a manager over.  My friend explained the situation and about her kale salad.  The manager actually had the nerve to say, "" there is not much kale in that salad anyways.""  He basically looked unconcerned and was shaking his head as if he didn't hear a word we were saying. It took another 15 minutes to get our checks because the split bills were all mixed up and incorrect.  Needless to say, I was so disappointed with the service and how the management reacted!  I have always had good food at BJ's, so that is where my 1 whole star comes from...  and I can honestly say I will not go back for a very long time or at least until there is new management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=240

David B.,"Katy, TX",218,95,17,4.0,7/31/2010,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is located near a few other nice restaurants similar in style, but they somehow manage to standout.   The menu has a nice variety of items from flat bread pizza to NY Strip Steak, and a little of everything else between.   Brewhouse is included in the name so they definitely have a nice selection of Brews. A separate menu of beers allow you to read up on the details and make your choice, however I choose to start from the top and worked my way down the list between visits.  I have eaten the MARGHERITA FRESCA flat bread pizza which was delicious and the BJ'S BREWHOUSE BLONDE beer for starters. The pizza was big enough to share between 2-4 people with everyone having 2 -3 pieces each. The beer was smooth while complimenting the flatbread and the atmosphere which included several large size TV's.  Roasted chicken was the entrée I choose for the evening, and it was well prepared.   The service receives an A+ due to the professionalism of all the staff dealing with a large party on a major event night.

There, I said that the best things about BJ's were the revolving door and the angled parking. I just gave them another try today since it has gotten good reviews on Yelp (Colleen says it's the shiznit), and it's in my hood.  Dining alone, I began with a light starter, Hawaiian shrimp skewers, accompanied by delicious sticky rice and properly-cooked broccoli, not mushy. From there I went to the Parmesan-crusted chicken with Cheddar mashed potatoes and more broccoli. Between the appetizer and the entree I got a good helping of Beta-carotine and Vitamin C. The chicken was the ""shiznit."" Three glasses of wine complemented the occasion nicely. The music was lively, almost like HUE's disco brunch. The service was attentive and I had a good view of a pretty impressive mural of workers gathering hops from a field. One misstep -- I couldn't finish my entree and asked for a box. Well, I got a box, but had to do it myself, selfish me. How hard can it be for a server to do that? But I tipped him nicely, and I'll be back.

The entire experience was AWFUL. My family is African American and I really hate to assume anything, but we felt like we were invisible when we entered. We were not greeted at all, though the white customers who arrived right behind us received a warm welcome. Normally, I would have walked right out but I was in the company of my 80 year old grandmother and 4 year old daughter so I let it slide. It was downhill from there. It took 40 minutes for our food to arrive which is ridiculous considering they were not extremely busy. My grandmother ordered a veggie burger with wedge potatoes...the burger was dry and the wedges were luke warm. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken but instead received a mushy ball of overcooked pasta. The sauce clearly had been sitting for a while because it was sticking to the pasta in clumps. On top of that it was cold. I brought this to the servers attention and he sent it back. The second plate was not much better and the chicken was dry and flavorless. After a few bites I loss my appetite. The servers attention to detail was terrible...there were no set-ups on the table until our food arrived, he never offered to re-fill our drinks, etc...it was just horrible. My entree was removed off of the bill only after we requested it be taken off. Sadly, on our way out, again we were not acknowledged or thanked for our business though the white family behind us was.

On previous visits,I have sampled their beers and did not find them to my liking. It seems since my last visit they have added an extensive beer list. I was happy to see this change. I ordered a popular Belgian beer and the server returned to tell me that it was unavailable. Next,I ordered a widely available seasonal microbrew and again it was unavailable. At that point,I received a phone call that I was obliged to take at the table(I don't like doing this when I'm dining out) and I was distracted. I ordered water.  Our server alerted the manager to the situation and in a wonderful gesture of customer service,she and our server selected another nice Belgian beer for me to try. I enjoyed it very much and was pleased to see their commitment to pleasing the customer. I was not charged for the beer.   On to the food. The menu is one of those that is so extensive that it is hard to make a choice. I opted for a steak salad. The veggies were fresh and the vinaigrette dressing very tasty. The steak was prepared a bit rare for my taste and a bit bland but it didn't ruin the meal. My son ordered the salmon and enjoyed it well enough. He loves that they serve the Smiley Fries well known in school cafeterias.  I have to get him on yelp soon as he has ordered grilled salmon in half of the restaurants in SW Orlando. My husband ordered the grilled pork chops and also enjoyed his entree.   The restaurant is big and open with an attractive mural painted on the back wall.

Patrick M.,"Orlando, FL",31,46,15,2.0,9/17/2010,Met a friend for lunch.  Staff was friendly and service was good.  I had their specialty BBQ mini pizza.  Was not impressed.  Pretty much all dough with light topping.  I would not order it again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
Melanie A.,"Palm Bay, FL",3,43,2,5.0,5/8/2010,"I went on a Thursday evening for my first visit and I was blown away.  Seated right away, the waiter was pleasant, food and bar service was super fast and really wonderful.  I tried the mozzarella sticks appetizer and they were very good and the Mediterranean pizza  was fantastic.  I also got a mango mojito and it was excellent too. My friend and I got a cozy, high backed, round table seat which was great and semi-secluded.  Definitely trying a dessert next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
Eric D.,"New York, NY",0,12,3,4.0,7/23/2010,I went here when I went to visit my cousin in Orlando. The pink lemonade is so good ! This place has lots of variety on the menu. The waiter was extra nice =),https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
Will W.,"Orlando, FL",4,2,,5.0,7/23/2011,"I actually live very close to BJ's and I find myself there pretty often. It is a very consistent restaurant and that makes it easy for me to visit multiple times a week (or sometimes a day). To start they always have super fresh salad greens on an ice cold plate. The California chicken sandwich is one of my favorite entree items and it is always cooked nicely and tastes fresh. I normally don't eat much dessert but the pizooki is delicious. I am a big fan of micro brews and craft beer, so that also makes me a big fan of BJ's own beer. I enjoy all their beers but their nutty brunette is defiantly my favorite of their everyday brews. As far as the seasonal beers the oasis and Oktoberfest are always something that i look forward to and enjoy for the limited time they are available. Not only Is the food great but the service is excellent! The management team is defiantly doing a great job of keeping an energetic positive vibe for the front of the house and it is noticeable. A few of the servers really stand out and are incredible.... But I would defiantly request Eric, he's one of the best servers I've every had at any restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
Anthony L.,"Orlando, FL",139,6,4,4.0,7/12/2010,I've been here a couple times. Food has always  been fantastic as well as service. Bj's own beer isn't half bad either!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
Travis S.,"Seattle, WA",13,75,11,3.0,2/22/2010,"Good food, efficient service, overall very pleased with the value.  I now have another place to alternate for dining out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
Nick L.,"Alexandria, VA",0,1,,5.0,7/29/2010,I love this place! They have great beers they brew themselves. The food is really good and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is really good gives you the sports bar feeling.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
Rachael V.,"Apopka, FL",0,5,,5.0,6/28/2011,"We live about 35 mins away but make a point of visiting this restaurant with and without our children at least once a month.  I am HOOKED on the Gourmet Mac and Cheese and my husband LOVES the fish and chips.  We have tried other items on the menu but these are our FAV'S.  We aren't fans of beer but LOVE their soda's made with real sugar and brewed right there.  The servers are always kind and friendly, sometimes the service is a little slow but that is only when the place is packed and you can only do so much about that.  We never wait long for our food tho once it is ordered!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
Gary W.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,4.0,7/15/2010,"BJs is a great place to hang out and have lunch or dinner. They have a nice long bar and tons of seating in the bar area and lots more in the dining room. The menu is packed with choices too. I had a turkey burger, pizza, club sandwich and grilled balsamic chicken and they were all very good. As far as beer goes, the BJ beers are great BUT- they don't brew them in house. They have them trucked in. The big tanks in the window near the bar area are only props. Now after saying that, I would definitely recommend BJs to anybody that likes good food, great beer and a cool atmosphere. All in all a top notch chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando?start=260
