Karl E.,"Hartsville, SC",1,3,,3.0,4/10/2012,"The service was quicker than normal. I got the roast beef, bacon, and mushroom sandwich and it was excellent! About half way through I noticed it didn't have bacon on it! They brought me a plate of bacon to make up for it. I would go here again. I think the food quality is always high, but the service is questionable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3?start=20
Brad K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,13,,4.0,6/3/2013,I don't get these reviews. We've been to this Applebees many times and have always had great food and good service. We especially like the 2 for $20 with the onion rings. Crispy and plentiful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3?start=20
Robert K.,"Edith Weston, United Kingdom",4,47,71,1.0,3/6/2012,"No starter but when ordered again came at the same time as the main! They ran out of diet Pepsi, how does that happen? And at $4 a beer and an average of $28 per person for 2 courses...I can't see me going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3?start=20
Kyle E.,"Atlanta, GA",2,67,4,2.0,4/25/2009,"Applebee's is the same everywhere.  I have given this place so many chances to be good and sadly it has failed most of the time.  Its really hit or miss on the service.  Last time I got my appetizer 30 seconds before my entree.  The place can be empty and still take forever.   Like I said, typical food, poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3?start=20
Elizabeth R.,"Hartsville, SC",12,11,,2.0,2/18/2011,"I'm still up in the air about this place. A few years ago I found a fly in my drink, and 2 dead flys on the table. Left immediately and didn't go back for quite a long time. Recently went back for a friends birthday lunch, the food was good, service was good, but the table was all sticky and the place still looked like it could use a good scrubbing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3?start=20
Cindy W.,"Florence, SC",0,24,,1.0,2/22/2012,"We won't go back.  The food was below average, service was poor, and they allow smoking in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3?start=20
Nate P.,"Grosse Pointe, MI",0,1,,5.0,9/2/2017,"I don't understand why there are bad reviews here. I ordered a Medium rare burger, it came medium rare, not Grey (well done) like every other chain. We have been here every night since we got in town. We came here initially only to grab our last drink after food else ware because we are used to bad chain restaurants.  This one breaks the mold. Skilled cooks, friendly staff, good drinks. This is a chain that's really a local spot. Stop in and don't judge it by the name, it's a fantastic place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Takara R.,"San Antonio, TX",72,8,,1.0,3/6/2017,My food came out cold. My waiter was high as a kite and my drinks were practically alcohol Free. I'm good. Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Brian D.,"Hartsville, SC",8,5,,2.0,6/26/2016,"I don't usually write about chains, but this is a special case. This is likely the worst Applebee's in existence and it has been that way for as long as I have lived in the area (6+ years).  The food is always sub-par (how do you even mess up frozen meals?!) and the service mediocre. Waiting for what seems like an eternity for some chips and dip or a refill on a drink when the place is only half way full is the norm. I only take someone here if they specifically request it and invariably they comment on how horrible it is. Just revalidated this today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Chad W.,"Denver, CO",153,331,15,1.0,9/23/2014,"I never write reviews for chains, but this place is so bad that I have to our of principle.  Unfortunately there are very limited options in town so we were forced to give it a try.  Fail.   Put in our drink orders...they don't know have several of their ""featured drinks"" on the menu.  Strike 1.   Okay, fine, let's place our orders.  As we order, they start telling us what they don't have as we try to order them.   Our first order starts with the all you can eat ribs (which is on a separate, ""promo"" menu included with all of our book of menus).  Turns out, they no longer offer AYCE ribs.  We ask why they included that specific menu, and she just shrugged.   Strike 2. Next guy orders a side salad.  We're informed that they're out of lettuce.  Yes my friends...out.of.lettuce.  Thanks for the heads up prior to anyone ordering.  Strike 3.    Next up, mushrooms with the steak.  Nope, out of mushrooms, too.  Strike 4.   Granted, I'm no big fan of this chain to begin with, but I expect at least a shred of consistency.  This place was a disgrace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Andrean S.,"Richmond, VA",0,5,,1.0,9/13/2016,The worst ever.  Came during lunch and had soup and sandwhich and the look at taste of the food was horrible.   I will never go back to this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Connor W.,"Hartsville, SC",80,12,,4.0,7/11/2016,"Can't even believe I'm saying this but Applebee's has really stepped up their game. Service was good, took a little long for the food too come out but our server was very attentive and right on top of it. Food was actually good as well! Well done Applebee's well done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Cherish B.,"North Charleston, SC",4,8,,2.0,9/15/2015,"Stopped in after dropping the kid off a school before driving home to Charleston. Place was not busy on Sunday evening, but it took a couple minutes for us to be seated. Service was pleasant, but slow. French Onion Soup was decent.  Potstickers were TINY.  The dipping sauce separated.  Once you could get through the oil barrier, the flavor was pretty good. The vibe in the air reminded me of a hotel restaurant, a little out dated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Curt S.,"Florence, SC",0,2,,2.0,10/29/2016,Order what you can eat with one hand so you can use the other to keep the flies off it. Not my typical Applebee's experience. Bourbon Street steak was tough and bland. Steak knife never arrived. Steak sauce came in a little plastic cup. Sorry. Won't be back. Staff tensions. Grumbling about one another.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Tom C.,"Muskogee, OK",0,4,,1.0,10/18/2016,"Extremely slow service. I eat at Applebee's all over the country and this one may be the worst. The bar has just one salt shaker, they pass it around to patrons as needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Anna N.,"Alexandria, VA",120,271,364,2.0,7/12/2013,"Went here with family after church. Wasn't expecting too much, since it's really just Applebee's, but was still less than I expected. The food tasted like nothing, I probably could have been eating cardboard and wouldn't have known the difference.  The price was good though. They have an option for two entrees and one appetizer for $20.00. The waitress was fairly attentive, and the restaurant was clean. We were seated immediately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Herman C.,"Florence, SC",0,1,,3.0,7/31/2016,Food was good- took to long to get it-had to ask for lemons 3 times- when we left we didn't even get a thank you come again- we have eaten here several times when we travel through Hartsville and service gets worse each time-next time we will find a different place to eat!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
R C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,44,28,2.0,6/3/2015,It's a chain restaurant. Usually they aren't bad. I did the Car side to go and I was busy and in kinda in a rush. I had made it for 6:20 the guy came out about 6:25 and said it would be just a few moments. I paid for my meals and finally it came out about 20 minutes later. I did carside so it would be ready  I could have just went in n ordered in that time.  The FOOD ordered the pretzel sticks with cheese. The pretzels were not even sticks they were broken pieces then cooked which I was ok with just looked sloppy. Not enough cheese either. The club sandwich was ok bacon was a little chewy and the tomatoes were the ends of the tomato.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Tom T.,"Kempton, PA",446,35,1,1.0,5/21/2014,"Less than happy. The waitress just got here, yet she has on a dirty shirt, with dandruff all over the back. The seats are ripped up, the carpet shredded, the place stinks. Just absolutely freaking gross!! Wtf???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Todd R.,"Hartsville, SC",5,7,,1.0,1/7/2012,"One thing about this particular restaurant, it is consistent.  Consistently terrible.  Whether it's the food, service, or often both...it has been bad for the five years we've lived here. A couple of times a year, I will try Applebees just to see if it has improved.  Sometimes we get a gift certificate that we feel obligated to use or something. There is usually something wrong with our order, or it takes 30 minutes plus to come out of the kitchen, or the server has been poorly trained.  We've even had trouble with take out - we got the wrong order. Just skip this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Jamie V.,"Gunnison, CO",0,2,,5.0,4/23/2015,"I ate lunch here while passing through town. I was very apprehensive because of the terrible reviews. I rarely do reviews, but felt it was only just to do so this time. I have eaten at Applebee's across the country with both good and poor results. The service here was adequate, meeting every request we made. The food we ate was FANTASTIC. It was so hot, fresh, and full or flavor. I was so glad we stopped in, it made my afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Kim T.,"Plano, TX",13,239,374,1.0,3/4/2012,"I've been to this particular Applebee's 3 times with my husband in hopes that the previous experience was just a bad fluke but they've consistently disappointed. The food is mediocre on a good day.  I ordered a pasta dish that had chicken in it and the strips of chicken breast were so dried out they were literally crunchy.  There is definitely no such thing as fresh food here. I ordered an oriental salad on another day which basically tasted like coleslaw with chicken in it. It was downright disgusting.  My husband had ordered a grilled chicken sandwich that had bruschetta on it which actually wasn't bad albeit salty. The service here has been often well, terrible. Two out of the three times we went here it took the server ten minutes to just come by the table to take our drink orders and it was obvious that our food had been sitting around in the kitchen for a while before being brought out to us (chicken jerky).  Out of boredom during our waits I would people watch and at least two tables near us had to send food back for either being overcooked or cold so obviously there is an issue with the staff.  Basically, unless you are desperate for mediocre at best American food I would pass on this place. There are some Applebee's that are decent but this is not one of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Omari B.,"Towson, MD",51,20,,1.0,1/16/2014,"This is the worst Applebee's in America! Bad service, watered down alcoholic drinks that don't even taste good! And the food sucks as well. I never wanted to see an Outback Steakhouse so bad in my life. I am not a hard man to please but damn, what a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Eve P.,"Durham, NC",28,191,4,1.0,12/29/2010,"I visited several Hartsville restaurants over the holidays, and my meal at Applebee's was by far the worst dining experience in town. Our server was friendly and as helpful as possible, but the food took FOREVER and 4 out of 4 meals had problems:  (1) chicken fiesta salad with no guacamole...we were told, ""They have it, but it's frozen"" - there is so much wrong with that sentence.  (2) overcooked chicken fingers - this is a staple for Applebee's, guys... (3) overcooked steak - we sent this back and they replaced it after a 30 minute wait...then they sent it back on the same dirty plate without even refreshing the sides.  (4) overcooked hamburger and luke warm fries The manager came over twice and was not interested in hearing about the problems. It took two complaints to get him to remove one of the meals from the bill. Then he blamed the problems on the crowded night and said they were understaffed.  The thing is that Applebee's has potential in Hartsville - they have a unique niche and people want to eat there. The menu sounds good, and I'm sure that those in the kitchen have the potential to cook the food for the right amounts of time. Just need to work on paying attention to the details and being open to customer feedback.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Charlie F.,"Raleigh, NC",215,981,1222,4.0,6/26/2009,Restaurant seemed unusually quiet for a lunchtime visit. I was seated immediately and my server was polite and took my order quickly.  The sirloin steak was cooked to order and the side of mashed potatoes was more than ample.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
Michelle D.,"Chesterfield, SC",70,255,120,2.0,1/6/2011,"The food was ok, but the bathrooms were dirty. I hate that! The Two for $ 20 deal is worthwhile, but get the steak. The other options aren't that good. We had the spicy queso blancho (cheese dip) for our appetizer, and it was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hartsville-3
