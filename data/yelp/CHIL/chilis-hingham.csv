Rob F.,"Reading, MA",36,147,19,4.0,8/6/2009,"On Tuesday evening, the team stopped here after a brutal loss to the local club...probably 18 sweaty guys in lacrosse pants and T-shirts looking to drink away the evening's loss and the season's end. Although it was not yet 9PM our waitress allowed us to have the 9PM pricing on appetizers. Buffalo & Barbecue chicken tenders, potato skins, southwestern egg rolls all very tasty and nicely crisp w/o being greasy. Nachos are weird - individually arranged with cheese and jalapenos, but quite good. Beer is beer... but the service was friendly and prompt and they happily accommodated our request to move several tables together...so if you're looking for a quiet place for just the two of you to have a drink and talk...THIS AIN'T THE SPOT!!! :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
Shannon S.,"Quincy, MA",95,295,8,2.0,10/23/2012,"Though I don't regularly go to Chili's, I've been a time or two and generally speaking, have been satisfied.  However, my first Chili's takeout experience was disappointing. I ordered dinner from this location on a weeknight, Monday or Tuesday maybe? And we selected the ""dinner for 2"" option. This included 2 entrees and an appetizer. We ordered two different fajita dishes and the guacamole starter. The guacamole was already browning when we opened it... clearly not having been made to order or perhaps even earlier that day. I know guacamole turns brown, I understand the effects of oxidation, but I expect my guacamole to still be green from the time I leave the restaurant to the 10 minutes it takes to get to my house. Maybe the avocados weren't even still good when the made the guac, I don't know, all I know is I WANT GREEN GUAC! Sorry for yelling. The fajita dishes tasted fine, were even pretty good, but the portions were so small. And for almost $15 a pop, (the dinner for 2 saved us some money -- but if we had ordered them off the regular menu) the portion sizes were unacceptable. I assembled 2 smallish fajitas and didn't have enough to use my 3rd tortilla. The chips and salsa were good -- I've always had a soft spot for Chili's salsa, maybe because in college it tasted so good with beer? But it was fine and I probably would have been happier with a meal consisting solely of chips and salsa. I probably wouldn't have gone here if I didn't have a giftcard to burn and I probably won't go out of my way to go back unless it's just for happy hour beers and bottomless chips and salsa (which you actually have to pay for.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
Alyson S.,"Holbrook, MA",9,3,,1.0,2/22/2012,"I really do love chili's despite the fact that it's a chain. Love all their food and drinks!! HOWEVER, the bartenders and wait staff at this particular chili's are exceedingly rude, disrespectful, and act like you have inconvenienced them by showing up at their restaurant. Even the manager spoke in a condescending way when asked to speak to her. All of the staff's behavior was so absurd that we had to send a letter to Chili's corporate office explaining the situation at Chili's in Hingham.  I would absolutely go out of my way to tell anyone to never visit this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
Todd A.,"Hingham, MA",0,16,6,1.0,1/11/2012,"The food here is terrible.  The only item I used think was ok were the burgers.  The last time we went, they had a whole new menu so I was tricked into trying something other than the burger.  Big mistake.  I had chile.  Very watery with almost no meat.  I sent it back after 2 spoonfuls.  My wife got the fried chicken dumpling things which used to be okay but they were full of grease and we sent those back as well. The bar is nice for a drink and they make great chips and salsa so if that is all you go for you should be fine.   I think all of the food is created elsewhere and frozen and they heat it up.  That is how it tastes.  If you have to order food try the burgers.  They used to be good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
Joy E.,"Rockland, MA",104,247,15,3.0,1/23/2010,"Two words ""Chips & Salsa"".  I do NOT care if this is a chain - I really like Chilis!!  The burgers are good, love the fajitas and even the salads are really tasty (though definitely not exactly for the ""dieter"")  The margaritas CAN be really good - but depends on the bartender (I have had some pretty awful ones..)  The service at this location can also be pretty hit or  miss.  You may have a prompt, friendly server one visit and a borderline rude, incompetent server the next.  But the food is always consistent and when crave the chips and salsa - I have to take the risk and come here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
David Y.,"Weymouth, MA",0,48,6,2.0,6/3/2012,"I know, it's just Chili's but still it's pretty bad. Haven't been to one in years but pressed for time I went with my wife and daughter recently and got pretty much grossed out. First it took about 12 minutes before a waitress even came over to greet us, she was nice enough but 12's a long time especially when the place is near empty. Anyway, the food eventually comes and the chicken in my tacos looks like it was made last year. Dry, cold, and tough. Oh well, it's just Chili's and we are pressed for time. Maybe the rice will save it. Hmm, not bad...what is this basmati? Hm, I'll take another tas- hello. What's this, then? A hair? Too short to be any of ours, and way too black. Oofa. Waitress is really apologetic and says she'll send the manager over. He eventually makes his way over and says ""I understand you had a problem with your food?"" Awesome, I get to relive it by relaying it to him. ""I'll take that right off the bill for you."" Cool, I don't have to pay for hairy rice. My wife and daughter's food was serviceable but everyone's appetite was kind of shot, thinking about some half-balding cook back there losing his hair. I didn't think I won the restaurant lottery, but maybe a free drink or dessert might've lessened the disgust. Guess we'll make time the next time to try some place else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
Corey G.,"Boston, MA",5,64,,2.0,6/22/2011,"Whenever we come here (Friday nights, Sunday afternoons, anytime) we wait at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged by a hostess/host, its ridiculous! Other than that, typical food and servers you expect at Chilis",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
Brian G.,"Boston, MA",0,34,,2.0,4/18/2010,"Its Ok. I would give it 2 and a half stars if I could. I went on my traditional G. Roommate Sunday Dinner with Steve and Garfield. They were dying to go to Chili's because I am sure they loved it when they were 12, any place is great when you are 12. I had some sort of fried onion strings for an appetizer, they were fast food worthy. I had the chicken fajitas for dinner, I got to be the center of attention with the steam shooting out, they were pretty good. Service was ok, food was ok and the price was ok. Their real slogan should be Chili's: Its Ok!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
Andrew D.,"Weymouth, MA",0,1,,5.0,12/8/2010,"We are two thrifty college students who go to the Hingham, MA Chili's almost every week! They have a very friendly and courteous staff, and we always get seated very soon after entering, even on busy nights. We like their $20 for 2 deal so much that we've become regulars, and the food is always great. It's the best deal in casual restaurants around! We're always saying, ""We should have gone to Chili's!"" when we get soaked somewhere else and are left with empty tummies. Keep up the good work Chili's, and keep the 2 for $20 deals, you will always make money on us! Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
Jim H.,"Hanover, MA",1,6,,4.0,8/21/2010,"We had the bacon cheese burgers. They were good. Had the chips and fire roasted corn guacamole for an appatizer, the chips were hot and fresh. Will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham
