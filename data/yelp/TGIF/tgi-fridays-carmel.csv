Bethany S.,"Denver, CO",77,387,211,3.0,6/16/2011,"I've been here three times now. I generally don't go to big chains like this because they're 1) not that exciting, and 2) aren't very vegetarian friendly. But I had a gift card, so the first visit I ordered a pasta dish minus the meat. Not so great, but it was meant to have meat so maybe it would've tasted better with it. I did try the sweet potato fries my mom had and really liked them. And the fudge brownie dessert was amazing! The second time I went, it was one of the few places still open. I got the Spinach Florentine Flatbread and it was actually quite yummy. Again, not amazing, but good. But now I'm thinking I like them mostly for their drinks (and sweet potato fries). I went back because they had this delicious-looking Guinness Stout chocolate shake, and the combination of ice cream and alcohol always hooks me. I liked it, but there was only a hint of Guinness taste. Anyway, they have a big selection of mixed drinks so I wouldn't mind going back just to try some more of those. Their service has always been great for me, and the look and feel is pretty much what you would expect from a typical chain restaurant like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carmel
Keith S.,"Westfield, IN",69,380,117,1.0,6/1/2011,"I stopped going to this Friday's a long time ago, but I thought maybe carryout would work.  Mistake. Got the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich.  It's maybe a 5 minute ride back to the office and I have brought other chain's sandwiches back much farther.  The bun was soaked to where it was stuck to the styrofoam container (no paper even to let you pick it up) and everything was soggy from the weird sauces / humidity from the fries.  There was something fried and unrecognizable between the bacon and tomato: was that supposed to be onion rings/straws?  Jack Daniels sauce was just dark sugar water. Learned my lesson.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carmel
Riccardo S.,"New York, NY",83,573,639,4.0,6/4/2011,"Here's a disclaimer - this review is just for the bar, as I never even got to the food part. Passing through Carmel to visit a friend, we chose to drop by here to have a drink and catch up.  I met Bridget and was welcomed to her bar, and quickly learned that she is an absolute rockstar.  Super-attentive, good pours, more panache behind the bar than Tom Cruise in Cocktail could ever manage, and a great and fun demeanor made her a very welcome addition to our evening.  Go here and catch her behind the bar before she figures out that she should be rocking her talents at a top-flight NY or LA establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carmel
Marcie M.,"Wesley Chapel, Tampa Bay, FL",435,519,29,2.0,7/5/2010,"My husband and I venture into the likes of chains for two reasons - 1) That is mostly all we have to choose from and 2) they are fairly family-friendly.  We pretty much know going in we aren't going to get the meal of our lives, which is fine, but I hate being OVERLY disappointed.  And, today we were. After a shopping trip to Old Navy and Bed Bath and Beyond, we spotted this Fridays and decided to grab a ""quick"" bite.  With a 10 month infant in tow, it's important to be in and out if at all possible while he is still in a good mood and not having a melt down.  He is usually good for about 30 minutes, so we can enjoy a beer and some food, pay and get out.  Isn't that what chains are all about?   Well, it was dead in the restaurant.  The day after the holiday, I suppose most people are either back to work or at the pool, since it's 100 degrees.  There were literally four tables in the whole place occupied and our waitress was helping just us.  But from the greeter to the girl waiting on us, everyone was more than just distracted.  They were downright unreachable....gone for long periods of time allowing drinks to empty and annoyances to rise. We sat with a pile of dirty plates for over 15 minutes waiting to get our bill.  Our waitress finally came out.  I was standing at that point with our son.  There was seriously NO ONE around...it was ridiculous.  We could have just walked out and no one would have noticed. She finally brought us our bill and my husband barely tipped her.  I am not a big fan of doing that but I suppose it proves a point.  Even when the restaurant isn't busy, it's good to SERVICE the guests who are there. I didn't really mention the food b/c it is what it is.  Nachos and wings.  Very simple and not horrible, but when you have so much competition in a market like Indy, the service really does need to be the best to keep us coming back.  Next time, it's off to Red Robin.  They are much better in the service arena.  I wish I would just learn my lesson!  But, I keep going back to these places in hopes it will be better ""next time"" and it's not. LAME.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carmel
Tom T.,"Lake Dallas, TX",3,34,,1.0,6/20/2012,"We gave the management lots of chances to put their ""foreground music"" into the background, but the corporate ""theme"" seems to be more important than our experience. The food is good enough (we could always find something we liked), but dealing with the management and the ""holy fear"" of corporate punishment for working around the ""foreground music policy"" so we could hear our conversation just isn't worth the trouble of walking in the door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carmel
Tim W.,"Indianapolis, IN",46,164,78,3.0,4/17/2011,"It's hard to avoid chains sometimes. You can depend on them to get you in and out in a certain amount of time and the food can be dependable. I've been to this TGIFridays several times and it fills the bill. Good service, good food. They change their menu around a lot so for as infrequently as I go, there's usually something interesting to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carmel
