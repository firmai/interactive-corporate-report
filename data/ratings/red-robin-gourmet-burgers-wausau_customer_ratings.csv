17,Mike L.,"Schofield, WI",0,1,,4.0,2016-04-20,"Had dinner on one of their preview nights.  Service needs some work, appetizers came before drinks, but dinner was good.  Although a chain, its a welcome addition to the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
9,Anikka T.,"Wausau, WI",12,12,17.0,3.0,2016-04-29,"We attended on their preview night for free prior to their opening. We were not encouraged, instructed or rewarded in any way for writing this review. The service was very confusing. We initially were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. We said yes but then were brought back to the lobby as the table had been taken. We then seemed to go to the bottom of the priority list even though we were told we'd be at the top. Several groups of our same size who came in after us were seated before us. We were asked for a number they could text when  the table was ready (despite the fact that we were sitting right in front of them). I got a text that the table was ready and went up and they said it would be just a couple minutes. About 10 minutes later we were seated. Once seated we had 3 different servers and I am not sure if that was intentional or just a part of the chaos of training new staff. There was a touch screen at our table and it wasn't clear if we were supposed to use that to order or if it was just an option. Although I love technology that's not how I want to order at a restaurant.  The food was good but for one small appetizer (we requested the large size and received the small), 4 burgers and beverages the total was $75. With a tip that's $90. My husband and I go to a local restaurant and get a similar meal for about $25 including the tip (an appetizer, 2 burgers and a drink each). The food was good but it didn't justify the prices. I will likely only go back if there are specials/deals going on via their loyalty program (like the free birthday burger).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,

6,Rachel R.,"Wittenberg, WI",77,26,44.0,5.0,2016-05-25,"Well I'm completely blown away! A brand new place from a chain restaurant, and they e got it together so soon after opening!! Let me start with service- our waitress Rylee was amazing! All smiles, on top of drinks, explained everything, great suggestions! She was 5 stars alone!! Now the food- one word, YUM!! Burgers cooked perfect, and the menu is FULL of great original burgers, creative flavors, great choices!! Cooked to order, pink inside for me :) also, I don't think in my entire life I have ever said this----the fries rock!!! OMG! I'm not a fry person, nor even a deep dried food person what-so-ever, but these fries are amazing! I strongly suggest giving them a try (get a side f their in-house chipotle sauce for dipping) you will NOT be disappointed!!  My overall experience was fabulous! Fast, friendly, and yummy!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
13,Woods D.,"Schofield, WI",0,3,,2.0,2016-08-20,"Mmm, have you ever had a big delicious juicy burger from some hole in the wall bar? Well after you've tried a burger from Red Robin, you're going to be craving one of those. For being a ""burger joint"", the burgers taste just like your typical big chain restaurant's. You can pretty much just call this place ""Applebee's Lite"". Its applebees's burgers and apps, minus all of the other pre-made frozen delights.  If you're looking to get an appetizer, SKIP the spinach and artichoke dip. If you've actually had true spin & art dip, this stuff is a travesty. Go for the cheese curds instead, they're actually extremely delicious.  If you're looking for a great burger at a chain restaurant, just stick to Culvers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
15,Aaron B.,"Wausau, WI",11,11,2.0,3.0,2016-09-01,"Have been a regular Red Robin visitor for couple years now, always a place on top of the list when traveling. Use the Red Robin birthday burger on month of birthday as a good excuse to 'go out'. Burgers are always good, kids love it, endless fries, broccoli a hit always. Service is good. But it seems like everytime we go its near $75 to $80 for a family of 4... as I walk out the restaurant I am full and satisfied but feeling like I just got robbed... Its just way too expensive to stop in here more than once a year! Even with having stopped in on my birthday month I walked out all total with a modest tip added at nearly $95. Ouch!   I would love to be able to stop here more often and enjoy their premium burgers they are very good... but alas cant afford it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
2,Angie S.,"Marshfield, WI",14,2,,1.0,2016-10-21,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would l. I have been here 7 different times with my family & each & every single time one persons meal has been messed up severely. The managers refused to take money off the bill for the mess up. There is no space between tables, you are literally bumping elbows with the next table. Fries come out cold, service severely slacks!!  NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER COME TO THIS RED ROBIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
14,Angie W.,"Wisconsin Rapids, WI",14,5,,1.0,2016-10-28,The lettuce wrap burger was a great healthy option but paying $60 for 2 burgers  a cup of soup and a kids meal is outrageous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
11,Eric A.,"DeKalb, IL",23,82,105.0,2.0,2016-11-04,Over priced burgers.  Not that tastey.  The only positive is all u can eat fries.  Beers over priced.  Everything is over priced.  Hopefully their burgers will taste better in the future,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
4,Lucas W.,"Menifee, CA",36,11,,5.0,2016-11-11,"Walked in on Veterans Day, was seated within 10 min, considering the amount of people here, EXTREMELY fast! Our server Stephanie was on it! Drinks came right away, and food shortly after. Stephanie has a great personality and excellent ability to communicate with customers on their level! AWESOME customer service! She made our experience AMAZING! My wife's in the service, and she made her feel appreciated! Thank you for having quality and experienced employees to run a business the correct way on a day like this! This was our first time to this Red Robin and we will definitely be back!  Happy Birthday and Happy Veterans Day to you too Stephanie! Hope you had an amazing day!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
16,Sue T.,"Wisconsin Rapids, WI",4,1,,4.0,2016-11-11,"Our first visit to Red Robin, and my first review. I went there with no expectations, didn't know what kind of restaurant to expect. I don't live in Wausau and it was new to me. First the decor was casual and interesting, warm. Staff was friendly and professional. Our drinks were delivered promptly. The menu is big, a lot of choices and it took awhile to figure out the burger categories and combinations available. For a first timer it seemed overly complicated. The food came in good time. I ordered the guacamole burger with fries, the fries were perfect, fresh flavor not over seasoned,one of my pet peeves. Love the season blend on the table on the fries.the burger was very good quality, great flavor and done perfectly to medium rare, but ended up wishing I  had gotten what my husband got, the BBQ burger. All in all I definitely will go back, it's more expensive than your regular burger options but they do offer the 3 different priced burgers and it was well worth it for the quality and the overall experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
3,Summer M.,"Medford, WI",29,27,96.0,5.0,2016-11-23,We came while Red Robin was still new to Wausau so there was a wait so we offered to sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table since it was just my boyfriend and I and the kids weren't along.  Our waitress/bartender was super friendly and chatted with us and explained how we could order through her or through the little computer on the bar counter. It's a nice feature incase she gets busy and you're in a hurry. Both of our burgers were phenomenal and the endless fries were a great perk. Atmosphere was great and the place was nice and clean. Nice addition to the Wausau area.  We got a call and had to leave quickly so we used the convenient computer on the bar to pay our tab and we were on our way...so nice to have that option. Excited to go back when we are in the area for a good burger and great customer service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
12,Beth J.,"Mosinee, WI",0,1,,4.0,2017-01-03,Had a cheeseburger with a gluten-free bun. Best burger I've had in a long time. Don't know where they get their gluten-free buns but it was the best bun to burger ratio I've had since I had to go gluten-free in 2007.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,

0,Matt M.,"Stevens Point, WI",1,39,162.0,5.0,2017-07-10,"Stopped on our way out of town after a visit in Wausau. Had the onion rings for an appetizer. There were 3 of us so the small tower was plenty. So good & the dipping sauces were nice too. The $5 Wedge Salad is plenty for a light dinner. $6.95 burger you can't beat, ordered it with a side salad. The Southwest Salad was good but heavy on the beans. Otherwise tasty. Service was good. The manager came around a couple times to check on our experience there. We'll be back and refer others. We had a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
8,Bill H.,"Wausau, WI",0,4,,5.0,2017-08-08,We have eaten here several times over the past six months and the service has been excellent and the food has been very good and consistent.  My wife has been more adventurous with the menu and has found all of the selections to be great.  I'm a burger guy and the bacon cheese burger is very good and they have bottomless sweet potato fries which are outstanding!  The drink menu is extensive but also expensive.  I'm making the choice to eat out so I expect to pay a bit more for a beer.  My wife loves the chocolate shakes.  Great place and we will continue to go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wausau,,,,,
7,Nahid S.,"Wausau, WI",0,2,,1.0,2017-08-14,Horrible customer service. Very disappointed at manger. Food tasted awful.
