John D.,"La Marque, TX",59,176,288,4.0,1/5/2018,"Excuse my use of slang, but it was a minute between tonight and the last time I hit up BJ's. The last time I paid a visit was give or take three years ago. I came here earlier with my nephew, who'll return to college in San Antonio in a few days. We were fortunate to have Vanessa as our waitress; she sat us in front of a TV that was showing NFL Network. In my book, it's a plus to watch some tube -- especially sports -- while eating and drinking. We began with the Best Beginnings appetizer sampler consisting of boneless buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks, and avocado egg rolls. The item was big enough to feed two people. We were close to stuffed by the time our main meals arrived. I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. It was accompanied by an ample serving of fries. Not like it matters, but for some reason, I forgot to douse the fries with ketchup. Good thing they were tasty without the Heinz. I really enjoyed the sandwich. Simply put, it can best be described as a sizable piece of fried chicken nicely coated with a variety of seasoning and spices in between a bun. The pickles gave the fowl a solid sour kick. I managed to finish it despite being full from the appetizers. As for the rating, BJ's actually scores a 4.5. The restroom could be maintained better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2
Scott B.,"Houston, TX",2,7,,4.0,1/5/2018,"I arrived at 530 pm on a Friday hoping to catch happy hour prices and get ahead of the dinner rush.  Easily found a seat at a high top table in the bar area. The atmosphere is fine (granite tabletops, brick walls, high ceilings), music is not too loud, and there are 6 TVs behind the bar tuned to all the usual sports channels. Noise level is high enough already that I can imagine it might be a bit much at peak times. Decided to order 2 selections from the Happy Hour menu: Dark Horse Cabernet, $5, normal price $7.75 Avocado Egg Rolls, $6, normal price $10.95 Wine is unexceptional but perfectly fine for the  price.  There are 6 egg rolls on the plate, enough for 2 people. They are deep fried and hot with a very sweet dipping sauce. Calories are super-high so watch out. But avocados are  healthy fats, right? Overall I am going to rate this place pretty high. Why? Because it is better than just about  any other comparable place. I have been here many times and have been going out to eat in Houston since the 80s, so I have pretty much tried them all. The menu is huge (24 pages!) and has calorie counts for everything so anyone should be able to find something they like. Prices are reasonable.  Higher than Chili's and lower than       PF Changs. The usual downside of going to BJs is that it is very popular at peak times and staff has a hard time keeping up. Bottom line I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is clearly better than Fridays, Chili's, Marie Callendar (are they still around?), BWW, Hooters and it's imitators. Maybe on par with Brickhouse and a step below Houston's (told you I have been to them all). Now I am am going to dig into a seared Ahi salad ($15.50, big enough for two), relax, and contemplate my new hobby as a restaurant critic on Yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2
BigFishLittleFish F.,"Dallas, TX",0,60,13,5.0,12/16/2017,"We just visited BJ's Thursday and had a call ahead for 18. Oh, and in ten minutes at lunchtime. Not an easy task to pull off any day, any time. But they did it with flying colors. I want to single out our server, Brian. Brian took on our very 'challenging' family and sailed through the lunch like a real pro. There wasn't a hiccup the entire visit and the family were all very pleased with their food and especially the service by Brian. Large parties are extremely difficult but he handled it like it was a table for 2. Brian, this is a real talent and to do so very naturally and with ease that allows the diner to relax and enjoy their experience. This is true hospitality.  Thank you to Brian and the staff at BJ's Webster",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2

Adrienne R.,"Pearland, TX",2,1,,4.0,1/8/2018,"The New Orleans jambalaya was a hit for me. This dish was served piping hot, just how I love my food!  The spices were balanced for a dish that mimics New Orleans cooking. I really enjoyed it. I gave them only 4 stars because I asked my waiter for bread. He suggested the garlic knot, which I agreed to, but never received.  I could have reminded him, but I was finished eating by the time he came back to check on us again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2
Doug M.,"League City, TX",302,402,415,3.0,8/20/2017,"We haven't been here in a couple of years so we went again.  It is only fair that I give you an updated review.  Last time, I have them three stars.  This time, I give them three stars.  I guess BJ's will never become one of our favorites. My wife, son, and I came in early Friday evening.  We wanted to beat the rush to get to a movie.  We arrived around 6:00 PM and beat the rush.  Literally 10 minutes later, there was a wait.  We were quickly seated and the service was spot on.  Drinks were ordered and brought to us.  Speaking of drinks, they have really good lemonade.  I ordered the Root Beer Wings as an appetizer.  My wife ordered a pizza so she and I could split it.  My son ordered one of the burgers with no onions and no mayo.  Yes, we realize this wasn't our healthiest meal of the week.  Our server specifically asked if we wanted the appetizer before the meal or with the rest of the food.  I asked if them to bring it before the meal.   We didn't wait too long for the food.  However, my son received his burger with onions and mayo.  The manager was one of the people that helped deliver our food.  She noticed the onions and said, ""Oh, I see this has onions on it.  Is that OK?""  He said it was ok simply because it wasn't smothered in them and we were going to a movie so he would just take them off.  When he took the top bun off, he also noticed the burger had mayo.  He ended up sending it back and waiting for another one.  Magically, it was prepared correctly in about 2 minutes (literally).  Our server stated it was already ready but the person serving the food (remember the manager?) had grabbed the wrong burger.  He apologized.  The pizza was on a thin crust and tasted pretty good.  A thin crust pizza at BJ's is really thin but that is the way we like it so it was fine.  My wife ended up taking some of it home to eat as lunch the next day.  If you notice, I did not mention the wings yet.  That is because I did not get them yet.  I was supposed to get them before the meal.  It was an appetizer.  We got them after the rest of the food.  I've never had their Root Beer Wings so I didn't really know what to expect.  The sauce is the same texture as a BBQ sauce.  Simply, it is a BBQ sauce with a root beer flavor.  I liked it ok but won't rush back to order it again.  We ended up eating a free dessert because of all of the mix-ups. Bottom Line:  Food is average and the staff needs to pay better attention to their orders upon delivery to the table.  It may be a couple more years before I go back again.  Bon appétit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2
Austin N.,"Honolulu, HI",363,205,258,3.0,2/14/2017,"Overall impression: This place is really popular. Good standard American food, nice atmosphere. Nothing stood out for me. Average price: $18-25/dinner Positives: -pizza is good -pizzokie if you like that -high turnover of food -nice enough atmosphere -they have happy hour -generally pretty clean Negatives: -service was just average -it gets really crowded here (which could be a good or bad thing, just make sure to time your visit right) -nothing incredible about the food I have no huge complaints about this place. It's fine. Lots of seating both indoors and outdoors. Food is average. Service is average. Price is about what you would expect, although maybe on the slightly high side for what you get, but nothing outrageous. Lots of TVs around the bar area and outdoors.

Service is friendly enough and the food is consistent each time. Once I've ordered a hamburger where the seasoning was so over done that it was actually crunchy. I nearly felt sick and couldn't finish the food. Other times the food has been fine. It's a hit or miss kind of place so I'll go there if I have to.

Benny Jas. B.,"Friendswood, TX",16,16,,3.0,9/17/2017,"Here's a wonderfully designed and tastefully themed sports-bar-style facility - appears to be well kept, but also a little empty.  The menu includes a great helping of American fare (burgers & fries, etc.), with a sizable section for great pizzas, and an oversized/full bar!  The pricing scenario seems a bit higher than other restaurants of this type - almost 15% to 30% more than you might expect to pay, but the food is good, and if you've got that kind of money you would like to hang out there with drinking buddies, watching sports and galavanting.  Probably, this price gouge is the reason the place seems so empty.  But, when you got the cash you can practically have this place all to your semi-private party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2
Tiffany J.,"Pearland, TX",131,281,131,4.0,8/6/2016,"It's been about a year since I've eaten at BJ's. They have made some changes to their menu but they still have a great variety of  food and beverage options. We didn't order any appetizers but the honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts and the Brewhouse Blonde Asparagus caught my eye. They added a bunch of cocktails to the menu. My friend and I both had the Hendricks Cucumber Lemonade. It was so good and refreshing!  For dinner I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was really delicious! It came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The side dishes were awesome, but unfortunately they only put four broccoli florets on the plate. I thought maybe there were more hiding under the chicken or mashed potatoes, but there weren't. That was disappointing because it was really good. Of course the portion of chicken and mashed potatoes were massive, especially compared to the broccoli. I of course had to have a Pizookie for dessert. They added a few new flavors, but I opted for chocolate chunk because you can't go wrong. It was really good, but it was stuck to the skillet. We eventually had to ask for a knife to help scrape it off the bottom. My friend had the beignet and it was hard to cut through as well. The outside was really crispy and good but you still needed a knife to break through it because the spoon wasn't doing a very good job. I was expecting a traditional beiginet. This looked more like some sort of circular pastry thing with berries and whipped cream. No powdered sugar. It wasn't even that doughy. It was good, just different that the traditional beignet that I was expecting.  The wait staff was awesome and professional. The service we received was up there with the service you would receive at a fancy steakhouse. Everything (minus the lack of broccoli on my plate) was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2

Mark B.,"Houston, TX",416,313,2206,1.0,7/3/2015,"This visit from bad from the beginning.  Went on a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant was maybe 40% full. The hostess tried to seat us at an oddly shaped table that honestly just didn't look like much fun. The best part was there was an ill behaved child running amok at the next table. Yeah, no thanks, we would like to sit over here.  I ordered a burger with a wedge salad. I asked what came on the salad, the waiter told me, only he left it it would be covered in tomatoes. I am deathly allergic. They brought another one with out the tomatoes, but with a long black hair!! I didn't know that could still happen in 2015, but there it was. The salad went back.  My burger was severely undercooked. Medium doesn't mean raw.  Our server said the manager said to pick out a desert on him. We didn't bother, and he didn't even bother to come by the table.

I ordered a Strawberry Mojito and my mom ordered a Dr. Pepper. The mojito was alright, nothing too special.  Third, our food was a little slow coming out. But it was worth the wait! LOL!

Karen Y.,"Houston, TX",168,187,119,2.0,9/23/2017,"I wasn't going to write this review at first, since BJ's IS a chain restaurant that you normally wouldn't expect anything too far over mediocre for, but my most recent experience here inspired me to post my thoughts. Before this, I had always seen BJ's as a pretty solid place to eat with family or friends. This time, however, the food was the worst I've ever tasted from BJ's. I ordered the clam chowder and caesar salad combo, which was a big mistake in itself. It was somehow the worst chowder and salad I've ever had at a restaurant, which is not surprising because this isn't a particularly healthy or seafood-y restaurant. The waiter was really courteous but barely seemed to pay attention to our table, besides bringing us food and the occasional water refill. He didn't even clear our dinner plates before bringing out our pizookies. The pizookies were the only redeeming part of the meal, but then again, pizookies are really hard to mess up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=20

Given the crowd, the wait wasn't justified. Previously known as a pizza and beer joint, they've revamped their menu to include lots of salads, soups, steaks, and other trendy foods. Clearly their added quantity of items led to a decrease in quality. The pizza was ICE COLD. The cheese was hard not stringy, and the crust was soggy. Even the pan was cold to the touch, indicating the pizza had been out of the oven for at least 30 minutes. Considering the large group of 20 seated, we likely received an extra from their party. The server never asked how anything was, I had to call him over. He was rude and said he'd ask the kitchen. He only offered to put the pizza back in the oven for a few minutes.

When my group was seated it took forever before our drink orders with were taken and even longer before we actually got our drinks. At this point the restaurant was still fairly empty. As the dinner time ruch came, our service got worse and worse.   Our waiter let our dirty dishes pile up to a small mountain,  then he wouldn't bring us our checks for quite a while.

Almost 10 minute waiting and he didn't care to at least say ""I'll be right with you, etc"" (No, he wasn't loaded or busy with food or drinks, had free hands)-(No, it was NOT a busy night, counted at least 13 empty tables inside). He rushed us through the menu, even though I had questions. When he served a slice of pizza in my plate from the pizza stand, he didn't serve it, but more like threw it on my plate. He didn't even apologized. I got a feeling he doesn't want to work there, he treated us like items on an assembly line not like customers. Never had an experience like this in other BJ's before.

I started with a BLT Salad, it was good but if I had my choice I'd make it with Romaine lettuce in stead of Spinach.  I also had the baked Zita. It was very good but It's made with Penne pasta not Ziti pasta....I grew up in New York and most of my friend's last names end with the letter ""O"" so I know Italian food.! I love the house beer selection here! It is the main reason I come to BJ's. Tonight I tried the Nutty Brewnette and the Berry Blast Cider and both are VERY GOOD! The cider is sweet, crisp and refreshing! Great  job! I had it after the Nutty Brewnette and I think the contrasting tastes really worked. Kind of like eating salty pop corn and then a chocolate treat at the movies. So BJ'S needs to start selling shirts with their beer logos!!!! I'd buy one! Two! Or Three! On a  negative note the kitchen was slow at getting the food out. Especially on a night that was not that busy, the place was barley a third full!

Servers on the other hand are making sure many costumes don't return. Both waiters and waitresses are always rushing you, they are very cold when it comes to welcome you as a costumer, there have been many times when I have to ask for things 2-3 times & they don't even say ""sorry"" for forgetting. Look at the tables, seats, & floors...they are dirty!!! all the time. But this one is the worst and it happened twice. Waiter cleaned the floor with rags, put them underneath arm, wiped his hand on the side of his pants and grabbed my check to be paid..I can only see cross contamination there. A couple of days later, I called the manager and explained what happen. He said they'll address that asap. Guess what!! I went this past weekend and the same thing!! Dirty booths, dirty chairs, dirty floors, waitress was close to mean, and I could see her grabbing three glasses with one hand from the inside. I wonder if they go and wash their hands before handing out the next meal. Enough!!! They make me feel like my money has to be given...no! It has to be earned! Response: I did called the manager right after 1st event. We spoke about this issue and he said ""thank you for your feedback"" and he also said he'd talk to them. Since me and husband like the food, we went again the following week to find that nothing changed and that's why I have written about it for the second time. That's why I wrote my review because I already called and see no improvement. Thx So we went again during June for both husband's birthday and Father's Day and a couple of times this past week (1st week of August) just because I love the fried asparagus. I'd like to suggest the asparagus (all the fried ones and, grilled and steamed) to be cut shorter as the base of the steam is always hard to eat (very fibrous)  Also, maybe the meat can be more marinated as it's coming out very hard and not much flavor when I asked for it ""well done"".

I will be totally upfront and admit that I pretty much stay away from dark beer unless it's a really good one, but I've tried it both ways and it came out great! Their menu for food is very extensive, so they can accommodate even the picky eaters. Luckily they have an ""enlightened entrees"" section for those of us that want to eat without getting too fat.

I've tried a few things on the menu, my favorite being the dessert pizzoki which is what they like to be known for (it's a hot cookie in a deep dish cookie pan with ice cream on top - yum!

Ana G.,"Houston, TX",4,1,,1.0,8/24/2017,"What drew me to this location was the fact that they described their deep dish pizza as a ""Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza""!! However I ended up paying $27.25 for a pan pizza. When I asked the waitress who brought my food to curbside if it was the right pizza, she insisted they only had two pizzas so it had to be a deep dish. If your advertising deep dish then it should be deep dish. I was not satified at all with this false advertisement!! Laziness is not acceptable either. If the waitress didnt want to walk back to correct order she should of just canceled everything and told the truth instead of just say it was right when the picture of the pizza looks nothing close to what i got!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=20

The server was nearly lifeless but hey it was monday night so I get it!  It was not very busy given that it was a monday.  Anyway I ordered the shrimp tacos that comes with tortilla chips a homemade versions of salsa and a guac.  My food was edible and not too bad, but not at all warm either.  So you get 2 tortillas filled with homemade slaw, frozen shrimps that you would find in the freezer section at the supermarket, and a sauce.  I polished that off with a draft pear cider that was flat.  The server said it was prob cuz that particular beer hadnt been served so the carbonation didnt kick in yet.  The next beer I ordered was the draft berry blast combo that offsets the sweetness of the berry and that I did enjoy.  Overall I'm not a beer drinker but the combo of cider and whatever it was was good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=20

The spinach & artichote appetizer is good & my spouse likes the sliders, the rest are overpriced. The gourmet mac and cheese is enough to share for 2 but it's heavy. The golden beet & arugula salad is light & refreshing. The only mains worth mentioning is the mahi mahi tacos, the California chicken club, soup bowls & the pizza. The pizookies are very tasty.

Two stars because I love the food. I will return to BJ's just not this one Service is SLOW. I went after work with my 3 year old to eat at 5 before her recital at 7. I left at 6:50 still only having water. I informed the server and manager and they shrugged.  I went for lunch with a group of 4. Very basic orders (burgers, quesadilla, etc). Our server barely made eye contact with us. For me specifically she asked me 3 times, ""oh I didn't see you come in, what can I get you?"" What? I'm literally eating the food you brought me....  I get that it's a bad day but again to see the servers all chatting by the computer while tables all around are searching for their waitress.  On the last 3 occasions - water takes 10 minutes, drinks take 15 (non alcoholic) and food.... Let's just say, make a day of it. And don't think the manager will care if you complain.  This same story 3 times in a row.

Max Q.,"Houston, TX",0,42,,2.0,4/22/2017,"I used to eat lunch here once a week or so, but have finally given up on it due to the ever decreasing quality of service and the customers they allow in.  The last 3 times I've been in, I ate at the bar. Each time had the same annoying barfly who just can't shut up, asking personal questions and more.  Even politely telling him that I just came in for a beer and some lunch isn't enough to shut him up.  The female bartender each time has commented that he's talkative, but does nothing to dissuade him, even after a group of 4 got up and told her they were leaving and to cancel their order due to his incessant comments and questions.  Burgers are good, fries are horrid, beer is good, but usually barely cooler then room temp.  They have good prices on daily specials, but you have to be sure and tell the server/bartender about the special, as they typically continue to charge full prices until you point them to the clear language and special prices on the ridiculously lengthy (and greasy) menu.  My last visit, I decided to just leave because the barfly showed up and once again launched into his incessant commentary and quesions.  For my $7.25 bill, I handed the bartender a $20.  She asked if I wanted change.  Duh... needless to say she got no tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=60
Ken H.,"Houston, TX",38,231,1177,3.0,5/13/2014,"We went here once a week for a couple or three months when it first opened.  The manager then was terrific, but he soon left to open another location in Houston.  We've never found much we particularly enjoyed here except the Avocado Egg Rolls which are really good.  They also make a good burger, but so do other places without the falderal.   It's okay, but we rarely come here anymore.The service is spotty and the kitchen is slow. There hasn't been an occasion for it to come up in recent years so maybe this had been fixed, but they used to have a very rigid seating system.  If you didn't want to sit where they dictated it became a BIG deal and sometimes they refused to let you choose a location of your preference until you asked for the manager.  Edited 7/18/14 to add: On our trip tonight we did their corn fritter appetizer and the Roast Beef Dip.  You have to look carefully to find any corn in the corn fritters.  The roast beef dip was good but not exceptional.  The horseradish needed some zip.  If they hadn't said it was horseradish I would have thought it was cream sauce.   Added on 2/24/2016: We haven't been here since the last update in 2014,  We had the avocado egg rolls.  They're still good and I had my weekly martini which is a little pricey here, $7.50 I think and not generous.  Oh yes, they don't brew any beer here.  I know, I know, it's called a brewhouse but  those giant tanks are just ornaments.  Added on 6/24/2017: Back again.  My martini is still to expensive and skimpy.  You can see we come here regularly -- about once a year.  Tonight it was a good experience.  Our waiter had a trainee and both were pleasant and responsive.  With some trepidation we ordered the DEEP DISH ZITI.  It turned out to be excellent.  And we had their salted caramel Pizookie.  O my god, best thing short of an orgasm. I'm thinking of going here once a week and just ordering three of them.   If I had all I could eat of them I would eat myself into a coma.   ___ We've Eaten Out Every Meal for 30 years",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=60

Julie is my go to waitress during daytime visits as she provides the best customer service and is very attentive! We tend to usually order several appetizers to eat and I always stick with their IPA, the Piranha. The wedge salad is delicious, the flatbreads & wings are always great options too. But there is no way to pass on the poozkie! Today they offered a monkey bread poozkie and IT WAS AMAZING! I hope to see this item remain on the menu!

The price is a bit high for the quality of the food, but it's a nicer establishment so I guess you can at least feel fancy as you dine on your sufficient meal. We really enjoy the fish tacos and the new pepperoni dip is actually really tasty! The pizza is okay, but we're not really deep dish fans. My 8 year old loved the kids meal cheese pizza though.

Melanie H.,"Houston, TX",243,452,600,3.0,3/22/2014,"BJ's is a suburbanite's paradise. It's big, crowded, loud, and the menu has a myriad of options. If you've never been to a BJ's, it's kind of like a cross between a Chili's and a Cheesecake Factory. Instead of cheesecake, they have beer. And lots of other alcohol - wine, sangria, mojitos, martinis, etc.  The food is pretty good. I like their lighter menu. My favorite item is the mahi or shrimp tacos, which you can get grilled or fried and they come with chips and salsa. Pretty good and under 1,000 calories (most things on the menu ARE NOT).  They're known for the pazookie (sp?) which is a warm cookie and ice cream and which is, of course, amazing.  Overall, I like BJ's well enough. Not on a weekly basis or anything, but once every few months is fine. It's affordable enough and good if you're looking for a place with a lot of American-food variety.

Peggy E.,"San Antonio, TX",59,47,23,1.0,1/24/2014,"Today was my third time to eat here. Each and every time I've eaten here, the food was not up to par. I have food allergies. Not like *no onions on my burger, but I want onion rings* allergies. It's bad enough that I made up little cards to give to servers so that I don't have to drone on about how I don't have my epi pen and how expensive it is to have to go to the ER. blah, blah, blah... Today, my server cleared my salad with the chef who recommended that I change the salad dressing. OK, sure...why not? Out comes my salad, and guess what's sprinkled all over it as a garnish? Yep, one of my allergens. And it didn't even have any dressing on it!  My second visit, the waitress put in our order wrong. When we told her that we didn't order it, she did not correct the mistake, left it there like *eat it or don't eat at all* AND overcharged us.  My first visit was much like today in that the order went to the kitchen as 86 my allergen. Guess what I find when I take my to go order home? Yep.  Something's up.

Arturo R.,"South Belt/Ellington, Houston, TX",46,8,9,3.0,6/13/2015,Food was pretty tasty. The service was ok. Not exceptional but I can see how if you don't keep the waiter in check they will get away from you. I read a lot about the avocado egg rolls and tried them. They were good the sauce was great but they were pretty mushy and once cold not appetizing.  My biggest complaint was I ordered two Red Buffalos one was perfect but the second was totally wrong. The waiter asked if I had a problem with it and I said I didn't think it was a Red Buffalo. He took it back to the bar and the bar tender claimed it was a Red Buffalo and that it was just cloudy.  Now I have been drinking Back and Tans for many years and various Black and something combinations. The beer they brought me just didn't measure up. So after letting it settle for several minutes it still didn't look right and the taste was definitely WRONG. I finally sent it back and the manager got involved although he and the bar tender maintained it was a Red Buffalo. Claiming it was due to a barrel change.  I'm sorry it can't be true. I changed my order to a Dark Castle and it was perfect. Needless to say I will probably be back. But if your into beer as I am and that's the reason I wanted to try this place. Don't let them try to pull the proverbial wool over your eyes and serve you something you didn't order.

Mark F.,"Austin, TX",1,90,,2.0,3/10/2015,"Service was a zero. The two stars are only because the food was decent.  Our family of 5 waited 20 minutes for a table Monday evening. Drinks at the bar were fine.  Seated then ordered an app and our entrees. Finished our bar drinks shortly after that. Watched our waitress stand by the side exit door at a register with 2 other staff for the next 12-13 minutes. I walked to her and asked for our app and another round of drinks. She nodded and said ok but didn't budge. I went to the bar for drinks for our table. Returned with the drinks and waited a few more minutes then all food arrived. Obviously, the app was old and pretty much a leftover now.  The waitress checked by once near the end of the meal. Several of us were done. Plenty of dishes ready to go away. No action. By the time all of us were done, we sat for 10-15 more minutes with a table full of dishes and glasses. No action. As soon as the table next to us was bussed down, I stood and moved all our stuff to that table. Thought someone might get the hint. Nope.  Waitress eventually came around and offered dessert and the check. I think our host left $5 tip with a note that the service was awful.  I hope this was our waitress' first day and the manager and training staff were out with the flu. There's no other reason to be left in the breeze like we were.

Jenna T.,"Houston, TX",0,8,1,4.0,3/18/2015,"My husband and I enjoy going to BJs for a casual lunch or night out. They have an extensive menu. My husband loves to get their pepperoni extreme pizza. I'm not a fan of it(I prefer NY pizza), but he says it is great.  I have a couple of favorites: Mahi Mahi tacos and the Parmesan crusted chicken.  The fish tacos are SO flavorful. I get the fish grilled and it is flaky with great taste. The meal comes with chips and salsa, but I don't even care about that since the tacos are so good. The chicken is to die for! You get two thin cut breasts with excellent breading. They top it with sun dried tomatoes and basil plus this lemon cream sauce that you'll want to drink, it is so good! The chicken comes with broccoli and white cheddar mashed potatoes. This meal may not be low carb, but it is worth it. There is enough food that I always end up taking some home for later. Another favorite is the fish and chips. The fish is not overly greasy and they always cook it just right. Also, if you ask, they will bring you malt vinegar.  I am not a beer drinker, but I love their house-made root beer. It rivals the root beer Tom Wahl's makes in my hometown in NY. My husband is a beer drinker and loves their Jeremiah Red (I think that's what it's called).

Dean H.,"Hurricane, UT",0,27,,5.0,12/1/2013,"BJ's BREWHOUSE A NICE SURPRISE! OK, so we picked BJ's Brewhouse, in Webster, TX, because we were desperate. We had just checked into our hotel across the street (Thursday, 11/14/13) after a twenty-three hour, two-day drive from Vegas, and we were famished.  The parking lot was packed so we figured ""Twenty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong.""  Right? Right!  BJ's proved a very pleasant surprise (it was our first time there).  No actual Frenchmen were spotted. We requested a seat as far from the madding crowds as possible, and were given a corner booth next to the kitchen, away from the giant TV screen on which droned some football game.  Perfect.  We couldn't escape the overall din of a packed house with TVs everywhere, but hunger drove us to examine the menu and ignore the din. Presently we were proffered drinks, and soon thereafter along came our very personable and capable waitress, Cheyenne.  We asked her advice on menu choices, asked several detailed questions, requested 2-3 alterations and additions, and Cheyenne was off to put in our order. I took her recommendation and ordered a pint of her personal favourite brewsky, the Jeremiah Red (light, a bit sweet, not overpowering), and followed it with the Angus burger melt on sourdough.  My wife went for the fried artichoke appetizer and a heaping bowl of chicken noodle comfort soup.  All dishes came out exactly as ordered, and tasted great. The ambiance was ""upscale brewhouse"" with leather booths ringing the room and tables scattered throughout.  The crowd was largely young and hip, with the exception of us two old farts in the corner. Yes, we'd go back again.  Yes, we'd ask for the delightful Cheyenne.  Yes, I'd have another Jeremiah Red.  No, we'd skip going on a Thursday night, if we could avoid it.  Gets a bit rowdy for our tastes.  Might be just right for yours.

I opted for the sirloin steak, baked potato and asparagus (after being assured that neither the steak nor the asparagus were cooked in butter).

Zane H.,"San Francisco, CA",468,41,21,4.0,7/27/2011,"Everyone knows that everything in Clear Lake closes at 9pm and that the options are quite limited if you are looking for a night snack. BJ's is our default place to hangout because the food is great, atmosphere fun/chill, and the beer makes me happy! Heck, we would hang out here back in high school even before we were of legal drinking age. Everyone in the area knows it too because there is almost always a wait here. BEER - You want to know why the beer here is so good? All the beer in Houston-area BJ's is contracted out to your favorite local brewery, Saint Arnold's! Well, that, and the fact that they just have some amazing recipes. Having tried all the beers here, I will have to say that my favorite is the Harvest Hefeweizen. It's a Bavarian-style wheat beer that is a just so refreshing. The first time I had this beer, I remember exclaiming, ""What kind of crap beer have I been drinking up until this point?!"" I am also a big fan of the P.M. Porter (smooth dark ale with hints of chocolate and caramel). PIZOOKIE - This is the very reason we started coming here back in High School! Even if you don't drink beer, BJ's is worth the visit because of the Pizookie. Close your eyes, and just imagine a freshly baked cookie in a deep dish that is so soft and hot that it melts in your mouth. (Obviously, your eyes are NOT closed because you are reading this, but anyways...) Now, imagine that same cookie with a couple scoops of vanilla bean icecream on top. They have a variety of delicious cookies, including Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Oatmeal Raisin Walnut, Red Velvet, or my favorite, Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate. If you can't decide which amazing flavor you want, then you can get the Pizookie Trio, which is three smaller Pizookies of your choice. SNACKS & SMALL BITES - If you just came to grab a beer with your friends and aren't looking to eat anything substantial, then BJ's has a menu for you too! I will warn you that these things are popular, and they sometimes sell out of them on the weekends. My favorite small bites have got to be the fried artichokes, the spinach-stuffed mushrooms, and the mozzarella and tomato salad. FOOD - The deep dish pizza is quite popular here, and I would recommend the Great White or the Spinach/Artichcoke one. They used to have these amazing BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders, but now they only offer it in sandwich form. I still get it though. The menu is fairly extensive here, so when in doubt, just ask your server what's good.               TIP - It's always crowded. They do not take reservations, but will let you call in and put your name on the list. TL;DR - Beer and Pizookie! Beer and Pizookie!

It was almost like they were powdered.  The ""steamed"" vegetables had liquid running all over the plate desperately trying to soften the potatoes.  (Which actually kinda worked.)  The liquid residue means that the veggies were microwaved in a plastic bag and then cut open to be poured on the plate.  You are supposed to drain the liquid first.  Someone didn't bother to.   This place is horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=140

Eric B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2128,5344,4760,3.0,5/26/2010,"I took a 4:05 PM flight from OAK to Hobby last Sunday for a Houston-area business trip that includes Pasadena, Downtown, and the Woodlands. Considering an almost 4 hour flight , a 2 hour time difference, and mandatory visits to baggage claim and the rental car counter, I didn't see the signs of southbound I-45 until about 10:30 PM. My body of course told me that it was earlier, and with no dinner and only Southwest snacks behind me, it was time to get something to eat. So after checking into the hotel, I headed out on the lonely Bay Area Boulevard of broken dreams.  I tried Sherlock's Pub first, but the kitchen was closed. And although the beer selection was tempting and the waitress was very helpful, the only thing available on the menu was bad karaoke and heated up DiGiorno pizza. meh. So I headed down the road a few miles to BJ's, despite my vow that I was going to try to avoid national chain restaurant eating during this trip.  The main dining room was closed, but there was plenty of nice and comfortable seating in the bar area of BJ's. Various sports highlights were on the screen, but I wasn't in much of a mood to watch, as my beloved Sharks had just been swept from the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Blackhawks. At the same time, the Porter was tasty and it was great to just sit down and relax, even though it was past my bedtime.  Table service was friendly, although overall service was a bit slow. There was also the smell of stale tobacco in the air, even though I didn't notice anyone doing the dirty deed. The upshot of that was a bad taste in my mouth and barely lukewarm chicken sliders that were a ""bit"" past their delivery time. During normal business hours, I would have sent them back, but it was too late and I was too hungry to care. Even so, the food was tasty enough, gave me a bit of a second wind, and sent my back to the hotel in a reasonable mood, and more ready for the week to come.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=120
A. S.,"Houston, TX",58,119,14,3.0,5/27/2013,"BJ's is like a mini- Cheesecake Factory in terms of the ridiculous amount of items on their menu, and you have to know what to get or you'll be smack in the middle of ""meh"" city. Think upscale Chili's fare (with bonus pizza!) The pizza is the best thing about this place. With the wide availability of good craft beer in the area, the need for a sub-par brew pub is nil, but then again BJ's is a monster chain to be reckoned with. The beers range from middle-of-the-road to just plain mundane and all the way back to so-so. I like that they added the ""small bites"" section of the menu to beef up their (often) scant entrees. The size of the appetizers is almost laughable. We've had nearly every appetizer, from avocado egg rolls to calamari to buffalo wings and while boyfriend claims the wings are ""boss"", I can't say they amount to much above what we could get cheaper elsewhere. Six TINY wings on a plate, that'll be $9 please.  The servers are rarely friendly, the hostesses often aloof and busy toiling in teenage angst, and the food is always sluggish getting out of the kitchen. Sit in the bar area, get really good happy hour pricing/specials. If you don't sit in the bar, they won't tell you that happy hour prices do not apply. Enjoy your $60 tab for two! The best thing to do at BJ's is go at happy hour (ends at 7), get a flatbread appetizer pizza on special (don't bother with personal sizes, they're complete rip-offs), and a couple beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=120
David R.,"Houston, TX",0,17,,1.0,7/13/2015,"We arrived at 2:30 on Saturday after taking in a morning show at the circus. The wait for a table was short, as expected at that time of day. My dad ordered one of their black cherry sodas. The waitress returned to say they were out. I ordered a Goose Island Sophie. The waitress returned to say they were out of that, too. Even though the place was empty, the food took absurdly long to arrive. When the food finally did come, my youngest son's food was missing. That took another five minutes. So all in all, about 35 minutes for freaking kids chicken tenders and fries. The order of mozzarella sticks had a napkin between them and the plate. I assume this is to catch some of the grease. Except when you pull one up from the plate, now your mozzarella stick has paper napkin all over it. I snagged a piece of my wife's pizza. Very underwhelming with a gummy crust.

Chris H.,"Pearland, TX",36,173,2,4.0,5/10/2013,My wife and I were out running errands last night (Thursday) and realized we hadn't stopped for dinner. It was 10pm. Started looking for a place to eat that was not fast food. All of the restaurants close at 10. Our first three choices were already closed. The only option left was BJ's. It would be nice if more places than Chili's and IHOP stayed open past 10:00 on weeknights. just my opinion.  Ok moving on- ended up at BJ's in Webster. We have been to the one in Pearland numerous times so we are accustomed to the high prices for average food. I am a coke zero drinker and when I asked if they had coke zero I was told no. I said ok I will take a diet coke then. I was told Diet Pepsi was as close as I was going to get. I ended up with Diet Pepsi and it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I ordered the deep dish pizza and I know it takes time to cook. We were not in a hurry and I would rather it come out hot and overcooked rather than just barely done and luke warm. I ordered Pepperoni and Onion. what came out was Pepperoni and bacon. I took a slice off and started eating it. Realizing that it was not my pizza I sent it back. The waiter picked up the pizza and took it away. I was left wondering what they did with it since it had already been served. Anyway there was nothing wrong with my wife's order so she enjoyed her calzone why I sat and watched her eat.  The waiter admitted he put it in wrong and the correct pizza would be right out. For the price of their food I expect it right the first time. To give our server credit he was very busy with numerous tables.  Once the pizza came out my wife was almost finished with her dinner so I had two slices and I was done.  When the bill came it was $70!! the server forgot to take off the incorrect pizza. I guess I wouldn't have been irritated if would have been apologetic.  Anyway got correct bill and we were on our way. The visit could have been smoother but at that time of night you have very little options on where to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=120

Reid M.,"La Marque, TX",6,27,,1.0,5/2/2015,"I've been here twice, the first time our service was good and food was good, nothing amazing. Second trip was a terrible experience, I ordered a Medium Rare steak with a house salad, my friend ordered Lasagna with a wedge salad. Taylor was our server and after 20 minutes we had to ask a waiter in passing to check on our salads, he turned out to be the only helpful person during our visit. Our waitress returned a few minutes later with our salads and rather than acting apologetic she had an attitude. My friend and I are restaurant managers, we are never unfriendly or deserving of attitude. My house salad was a Caesar salad with ranch dressing, the waitress disagreed and responded that she just made it herself and it was a house salad with ranch. Unless their house salad is romaine lettuce with croutons and shaved Parmesan only, then she was wrong. When my steak came out it was well-done, I mentioned it to her and she rolled her eyes. So I decided I just wanted out of the restaurant. I ate my steak and we finished our meals before she even mentioned the issue to a manager. The manager did comp my steak - but my issue wasn't about the money.

Gretchen P.,"Houston, TX",226,761,294,4.0,1/2/2009,"I'm not certain how packed this place can be on a normal night, but at 8pm on NYE, there was not an empty seat in the restaurant.  My friends smartly made a beeline for the bar area.  No wait, we had a nice big bar table with stools (with backs) for ourselves, and the choice of watching the Rockets game on one of three flat screen TVs.  Just be forewarned, this is also a smoking section.  There are tall Plexiglas dividers, but they can keep out just so much smoke from the rest of the restaurant. I had the Artichoke and Spinach Pizza.  It was great, no Star Pizza, but really great.  They were deep dish with cheese cooked over the sides in areas.  The one thing I didn't like were the tomatoes.  They were fresh, but I just don't like fresh, cooked tomatoes on pizza.  Sauce is fine, fresh and cooked is weird and a bit too watery for my liking. This is a chain and I HAVE eaten at the one in Boulder.  They look completely different.  The one in Boulder has a college football team spirit/wooden furniture/ski lodge vibe to it.  It's in a strip mall and is very small.  This one is gigantic with lots of booths and a smoking section.  Both have gigantic kettles of their brew which are tapped for serving.  They're neat to look at.  I don't drink beer anymore, but it's nice to see the list of beers and their descriptions.   They have a full bar and wine list.  The wine is great, but average and a little on the pricey side.   If you're in the area, I'd recommend BJs...a friend of mine warns, however, stay away from the pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=180

Amanda H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",13,5,,2.0,5/7/2012,"So after a funeral, around 25 of us decided to stop in for lunch to visit and enjoy a great meal (or so we'd hoped)...alas, that was not to be the case. This is a review of the experience had by my husband, our 13-year old son and myself.   My husband ordered a beer...waitress came back and said they didn't have it. This happened 4 times. Finally, my husband opened the beer menu and asked the waitress to tell her what they did have. She pointed to a long page of beer names and said that they only had the first beer listed on the page.  She mentioned quite a few of BJ's microbrews and some of the more 'routine' beers.  He finally found one they had in stock.  Then, I ordered a frozen margarita. it was half melted and pretty gross. I asked my husband if he wanted it... he took a sip and said it was too gross to drink. I then ordered an unsweetened tea. I had to ask 2 people over 10min for the tea. They finally brought me a sweet tea. I sent it back and said it needs to be unsweet. (I'm not diabetic but I try to avoid sugar when I can and Splenda works just as well as sugar for tea)...so she brings the correct tea and our appetizer. It also took about 40 minutes and asking 3 people for our son to get his Sierra Mist.  Now the appetizer:   We wanted something simple and ordered chips/salsa.  The salsa was pretty good. It had fire roasted tomatoes and a very good flavor. The chips were a mix of blue corn tortilla, red and white tortilla chips. They were not greasy and very flavorful, but too few. It made our $5.95 appetizer look sparse.   All the food came out in an appropriate time for a group of our size. Now, I will say that of the 20 people at our table, almost everyone had something wrong with their meal. My husband ordered jambalaya. He said it good but a small size for a $15.95 meal. I ordered a baked potato with the basics...cheese, bacon, sour cream, butter and chives. I had to pay $1.95 extra for the bacon and cheese. The baked potato was very dry and tasted old. I'm not sure how else to describe the flavor. The toppings were sparse (especially when I had to pay extra). The brought out a side dish with what appeared to be sour cream with the chives on top. So I loaded my fork with potato and dipped it in the 'sour cream' and chives then took the bite...it was only then did I learn that I'd just taken a huge bite of butter with chives on it. All I can say is ""ewww""...I didn't eat anymore after that. My son ordered a cheese pizza. It also had fire roasted tomatoes on top. It was cheese bread (no sauce) with tomatoes sprinkled on top. The majority of the pizza was crust. It was poorly prepared and (I think) $14.95. When a 13-year old boy won't eat a pizza, you know something isn't right. :-)  There were other issues as well:  I couldn't get a refill on my tea, was unable to get a to go tea, my son never got his drink refilled.  Oh, on a side note...this restaurant would not let us make a reservation, even with such a large group. To read this, I'm sure you're thinking that I complain a lot, but let me assure you, my husband and I are very easy-going people.  We enjoy friendly interactions with the wait staff, aren't overly picky about minor food issues and rarely every complain to a manager (I can think of 3 time in the past year, including this outing).  That being said, some things warrant speaking with the store manager and when that doesn't bring desired results, going to the next level manager.  This is one of those times.  Let me explain (the short version): When it was time to pay, my husband put his credit card in the folder and gave it to the waitress.  Three other groups at the table paid with cards.  About 20 minutes later, the waitress walked over to my husband and loudly told him that his credit card was declined.  While she handed my husband the folder, she held up another folder and asked loudly, ""who is Charles ...""  My husband said that was him and she handed him the second folder.  We then realized, she'd given us someone else's credit card (the one that had been declined).  They'd put our bill with the wrong card and someone else's bill with our card.  (Are you confused yet?)  We take our credit card safety very seriously.  We have close friends who have been the victims of identity theft.  They had excellent credit history...now, after the theft, they've filed for bankruptcy and are struggling to rebuild their credit.  We spoke with the manager, who completely blew us off.  He didn't care to listen to our concerns and asked us if we'd ""be happy"" with a $20 dollar BJ's gift card.  He handed it to my husband before he could answer.  I guarantee the gift card is useless.  We will not be returning to BJ's anywhere.  We feel that it's average food for above average prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=160

Their menu is really expansive so I had to start pulling choices out of a baggie blindly so that I'm not tempted to get the same thing everytime.

Adrian W.,"Mobile, AL",7,2,,2.0,6/16/2013,"BJ's gets 2 stars only because there is no 2.5; good food and good beer, poor service with bar staff who didn't know how to tend bar. Wife and I sat at the full service bar for drinks and appetizers, and to watch game 5 of the NBA finals. After asking for drinks without being offered any, and having to ask for menus and flagging down one of the two bartenders to put in our order, our apps were served. We had the ahi poste, which was really good, and the black and bleu flat bread pizza, which was also put together really well.  The food was good, the service was lacking. For a self proclaimed ""Brewhouse,"" neither of the bartenders knew how to properly pour a craft beer. The IPA was super foamy, and no attempt was made to remedy the discrepancy. The stout was poured haphazardly from the tap and splashed into the glass, and the head looked as if someone had shaken a soapy glass of soda. On four or five different occasions, floor servers brought back drinks from dining room customers who were not satisfied with their drinks.  No management interaction, coupled with bartenders who kept their backs to the customers in order to watch the game instead of paying attention to their patrons brings this review down significantly. Decent plates and a better than average selection of beer is their only saving grace.

Matt F.,"Dickinson, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/18/2015,"We decided to give this place a second chance. It has been well over a year since we have been there. I will not be back for another year at least. Tell me why, both times we have asked for a ""Table"" and been given a half booth half table. Tell me why, when we inquired about a different table we are told the section is not open(the first visit) or given a stupid look and made to feel uncomfortable(the second visit). So now we are sitting at our half booth and half table and its dirty. Lemon seeds stuck between the table and the wall. What looked like mold in the cracks of the booth(forgetting the fact that we didn't want a booth in the first place). Server had two tables. Took well over 5 min to get a tea and a water. Had to tell him again what our app order was because ""He drew a blank.""  Each part of our meal was delivered by another server. This isn't that bad because I understand teamwork. However, there is a difference between team work and doing someone else's job. I should have tipped the other guy. Maybe I'm picky, but if I'm going to spend my money on a full service experience, maybe I should have gotten one. I'm almost positive that this could have all been resolved if a table touch would have been done by one of the three managers they had on duty that stood next to the bar and talked the entire time.

St. Arnold's brews them locally so they are relatively fresh even though they aren't actually brewed in the tanks at the front of the restaurant.  They always have a seasonal on tap along with four or five year-round offerings (in addition to the usual restaurant beer offerings). So try it out sometime - if there's a wait, it's usually not long and they are somehow usually pretty quick about getting big groups sat even when the place is hopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=160
Ivelisse R.,"San Antonio, TX",7,69,,4.0,8/13/2013,"First time visiting BJ's on our out of town getaway. It was amazing! Love their flavored sodas, and the food was amazing. The service could have been better, but it was great overall. Will have to try it back home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=160
Slo L.,"League City, TX",31,43,5,3.0,8/9/2010,"FAILED! Friday night, trying to figure out what to eat in the area. Almost every restaurant out here, I've either tried it, didn't like it or getting tired of eating of the same place over and over. So we're driving around the area trying to figure out what to eat and to see if we've tried any other new places yet. I heard that BJ's was a good place to dine at. So we decide to check it out. Since it's a Friday of course it will be busy. The wait for 2 people was only 20 mins so it was ok. Waiter was cute and nice. Gave good detail of the menu order. I wanted to try the beers there since its a brewery. Well didn't get to try any of the beers cause their fridge or cooler was broken so there was no cold draft beers except bottles. How the hell you gonna have a brewery and not have cold draft beers?!? I ended up getting a Corona.. We tried the Avocado eggrolls and it wasn't that bad. I think this was way better than my damn fish tacos.    I'm a big fan of fish tacos. I asked the waiter if it was good and he said yes since he loved fish tacos too. I trusted him and got the fish tacos. When I got my fish taco, it was ehhh, the only freaking problem was it wasn't grilled. I prefer grill over fried. Plus the stupid fish looks like a freaking fish stick! WTF?!?!  If I wanted fish sticks, I would of ordered it. Why would you give me fish sticks as a fish tacos?!?! Overall, I still think Tortuga in Galveston or Pappasito's have the fish tacos soo far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=160
James L.,"Friendswood, TX",5,154,,1.0,11/27/2011,"This place calls itself a brewery?  Oh my.  The beers on tap are the same.  Every day. Every week.  Every month.  You can't get a growler.  Or a half keg. Or a keg.  The 17-year-old servers know nothing about beer.  It's not a microbrewery in any shape, form or fashion.  But, judging from the under and barely-over 21 crowd, that really doesn't matter. Wrap a wonton wrapper around guacamole, fry, and voila! an avocado egg roll. Throw a DiGiorno Pizza in the oven and voila! BJ's deep dish pizza.  Impressive?  Not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=160
Samantha D.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,9,8,4.0,6/17/2012,I like the bar here. Pretty decent beer selections and the food is great. Good place to come and have a great beer and a snack. My husband and I have a couple of belgian ales with some wonderful appetizers for under $40.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=160

Dynamo F.,"Houston, TX",9,78,15,2.0,7/20/2014,"As an inner-looper, I rarely travel to one of the suburbs. I have visited this restaurant twice in the last two months. The first time was with a group of friends  and we came on a night when there were several ""cheerleading groups"" there for dinner. The service was slow, however, unless each large group calls ahead, events like this can't truly be planned for in advance. The huge disappointment was the server who brought the wrong non alcoholic drink to my friends who eat there quite a bit. My friend explained to the server that her drink was not correct. The server responded it was basically the same. I had to contain my laughter because this is exactly the type of instance the managers at BJ's probably don't envision for employee if the month.This coupled with forgetting to enter our dessert order at the end of the meal made this a very laughable experience.  My second visit was this past Friday evening. The pizza was good, drinks pretty weak, and again, the service very slow. 25 minutes from the time we ordered a cobbler dessert to having at the table is pretty bad. I agree with most people who say the service is spotty. I understand this is a chain restaurant that meets the needs of their customers and have several friends who rave about the food. Just not my thing...especially when I'm used to being in restaurants with great service and attentive servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-webster-2?start=160
