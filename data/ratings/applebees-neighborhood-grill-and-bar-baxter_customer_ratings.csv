5,Glenn M.,"Treasure Island, FL",98,426,218.0,3.0,2013-02-26,Had to try the new under 500 calorie menu item and had the Napa Glazed Chicken Breast and I had to say it was actually pretty good. While Applebee's is not first in my mind for food choices the new under 500 Calorie choices will move it way up the list. Staff was very friendly and I would eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
10,Justin N.,"Bovey, MN",0,5,,1.0,2013-08-13,Worst boneless wings I've had. Had dirt in the wings from them not washing the celery. Service was fairly poor too,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
7,Matt L.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,9,,1.0,2014-04-04,"Absolutely horrible! 1st time there had burgers the buns were rock hard, bacon burned on edges and raw in the middle and had maybe 8 fries in each plate. Waited over a year and tried it again. Even worse, found paper in burger, ordered vegetables and received mashed potatoes and another rock hard bun. Will never go back here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
9,George T.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,18,1.0,4.0,2014-08-18,"Underrated.  They have numerous entrees I cannot make at home and they are delicious.  Servers are friendly. Matre'd's  ...weird. Late night  ""happy hour"" discounts on drinks and appetizers is very good.  Nationwide, they offer the perfect Margarita...and I have yet to get a bad one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
4,Jarrod M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,3,2.0,1.0,2014-09-02,"If I could give this place negative stars I would.  The last time I was here I said it would be the last time. I caved for my 5 yr old.  My salad had 4 ingredients. Lettuce, blue cheese, walnuts, and bacon. Didn't get bacon.  My mini cheeseburgers, literally the size of a .50 piece, somehow undercooked. Bright pink inside.  The wife's order completely wrong.  The kids pizza bread both burnt.  And for a grand finale?! We sat for an extra 20 minutes after asking for our bill because the computers were down. Couldn't even pay with cash.  This place is total shit.  You're better off at McDonalds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
6,Guy B.,"Brainerd, MN",0,1,,1.0,2015-02-09,"HANDS DOWN THE VERY WORST PLACE TO EAT IN BRAINERD/ BAXTER. Your better off eating out of the dumpster behind culvers you'd probably get better service and definitely better food, and I hate culvers. This area has so much better to offer than the garbage they're microwaving at Applebees, and at a much better price with WAY better service. Completely dissatisfied with my eating experience, I mean when you can't even get all of your French fries cooked beyond freezing point that tells me that someone really doesn't care about their job and management isn't doing anything to make it better. If you want a great meal with excellent service go to Grizzly's or Baxters bar and grill both great places, and I'll never go out of my way to give Applebees another chance. HORRIBLE!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
8,Jen D.,"Baxter, MN",0,12,,1.0,2015-03-17,"Hands down worst place to eat in the brainerd /Baxter area.  Terrible microwaved mess of a menu, and horrible service.. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
1,Pat C.,"Calgary, Canada",6,83,167.0,4.0,2016-07-18,"It's Applebee's! Relax its comfy, it's friendly, the manager on duty was the nicest, most accommodating in a long time. But obvious if you dont think I should be fussy about this place because I haven't had a bad experience, then you don't know travel as a job requirement. The food is predictable , the staff is as well. But when they shine they shine.  Come on people it's Applebee's I have never been to one that I got down thing different then I expected.  Four stars it is!! Go Brainered/Baxter!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
2,Shanna N.,"Pequot Lakes, MN",4,7,,2.0,2016-08-03,"A group of us order every Friday from a local business for lunch. We are on a time frame and order as quick and easy as we can. Twice now we have ordered and a sandwich is missing, fries are wrong and God help us if one person doesn't want something on a salad or sandwich. Never fails, again this time we got all the orders but everyone that ordered a Salas, was missing something. Car side to go----make sure you have them stand there and go thru the order with you.  We have given up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
3,Tyler J.,"Brainerd, MN",21,3,,1.0,2017-01-30,"Just ate there last night and came out incredibly upset. Not only was our waitress unengaged wth my wife and I, but she must have completely forgot we were her customers. The wait was inexcusable. Sat for over an hour just waiting to order our main courses, which our waitress didn't take, it ended up being the hostess. Our drinks didn't come to us til after a 45 min of sitting. The food didn't reach to our table til close to the two hour mark and that was just the appetizers. Not only was the wait long but the environment was the most unprofessional I've ever experienced at any restaurant.  Our waitress ignored us when we were visually upset because of the wait, the lights kept dimming and getting brighter every so often, and the worst of all was the fact the kitchen staff (which was apparently so understaffed and busy) was yelling and singing loudly so the entire dining area could hear. Then the food came. Burger was over cooked and was just a regular bacon cheeseburger instead of a triple bacon like they said. My fries were soggy and the chili and cheese on top of it was cold. One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Never going to the establishment again. And I hope anyone reading this doesn't either seriously an F",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
0,Anni O.,"Wadena, MN",0,6,5.0,2.0,2017-10-20,L o n g wait for food on a Friday afternoon. Service s l o w.  Food lukewarm. Good thing the drinks were fast and delish. This Applebee's seems to be a hit or miss on service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-baxter,,,,,
