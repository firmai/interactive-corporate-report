Joyce V.,"Bellflower, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/25/2017,"I would give this negative stars if I could. We had the worst service ever!!!  After waiting 15 minutes after we ordered a beer, we went to the bar and got it ourselves. The server was no where to be found. The manager took our food order. Another server brought us our food. Waited and waited for our check. Finally asked another server to tell our waitress we needed our bill. She did and the server went the other way. The only time we saw our server was when we first sat down and she took our drink order and when she went to the table across from us to pick up her tip. We won't be going back to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40

Noemi H.,"Bellflower, CA",28,4,4,2.0,2/14/2017,I had Horrible service today. From the moment we walked in from the hostess to the waiters ignored us and didn't offer us seating until we spoke up. The only time we spoke to the waiter was  when we called her to take our order and then the check. Never came to check up on us to see if we needed anything or if we were ok.  Food was good but makes you not wanna come back when customer service isn't good. I went during lunch and it wasn't busy so I'm not  exactly sure why we weren't given a better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40

Frank M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,1.0,12/4/2016,"The worst place ever when it comes to take-out. Your always waiting for your order that you placed over 45 minutes ago, the cashier is smart mouthed and talks to people disrespectfully when frustrated and question his customers on requests. If you want to dine-in you-ok definitely get your food on time because take-out comes last. For the future if you want take-out the Cerritos CPK will be a better option. At least they take pride in their customers. Unlike the Manager (Eric) at Lakewood CPK, he'll just tell you we're busy so wait an hour until I tell you the food you ordered is ready or when we ge",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40
Tina N.,"Hawthorne, CA",2,12,31,5.0,6/23/2016,"After leaving the CPK from Pine St in Down Town Long Beach because of the horrible service, we came here hoping the service wasn't the same. Our server Tina, came to my table with a smile, asked my family and I how our day was going and took our drink order right away.  We ordered our food and the manager happened to sit right next to us on her break. Her name was also Tina! She asked us if everything was okay and if we needed anything else she's right there to help us.  She seemed so cheery and super nice, so we somehow just ended up having a conversation with her and found out it was her birthday that day! We told her our experience at the other CPK and she apologized, even though she wasn't responsible for the management there.  I've never met someone so kindhearted like her.  I asked her why she was working on her birthday and she says she loves coming to work because her staffs are like her family. That was the sweetest thing!  Definitely coming back here to visit Tina!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40
Maggie M.,"Signal Hill, CA",69,33,10,4.0,3/11/2016,"I haven't been to a CPK in a long time. This location was pleasantly surprising, the atmosphere was nicer than most of the other locations I've been to and there are many options for the lunch special duo's.  I ended up getting my usual, the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, which was just as good as it always is. The half order was too much for me to finish. My boyfriend got one of the lunch duo combinations with the Classic Crispy Chicken and the Sedona Tortilla Soup. They both looked great and he was really pleased with his food.  The only negative criticism I have is the lack of follow up after we received our food. We got our food in a very timely manner but no one checked on us for the remainder of our visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40

We said fine went back 30 minutes later and they said they called me 20 min after. Then they put us on another hour wait. and finally told us they don't have seating for a big party. so we left.

Akisha B.,"Norwalk, CA",707,302,745,2.0,6/12/2014,"I usually don't write a review for chain restaurants, because the same foods is served at each restaurant. So when I do write a review, it has to be because of impeccable service or the opposite. Well my experience was the opposite.  My mother and I are seated, given menus and then order is taken. We knew what we wanted, so we ordered right away. (Lunch menu: 7"" mushroom and spinach pizza and Mediterranean salad for $10.95) Now maybe you have to request for a basket of bread and oil, but we weren't offered any. And the fact that other tables were given bread and oil,  just kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Our food arrives, and we have no napkins. Our waitress never came to check on us. We only seen her when we ordered our food and when it was time to pay for our food. So customer service here was WACK! Don't get me wrong, the waitress was nice when we did see her, but she did a terrible job checking on us. And what really sealed the deal, given spoons 4 times and each time the spoon was dirty. So it's dessert time. I ordered the butter cake with ice cream. 5 stars just for this dessert. The butter cake is oh so good! Ok, now back to the dirty spoons. With our dessert, we are given a spoon. The spoon had dried up cheese, and the other spoon has dried up food particles on the handle. ""Gross! I'm not putting my mouth on those spoons."" So we ask for two more spoons. What do you know, both spoons are dirty. ""Dang, do y'all wash these utensils? "" Apparently not! At this point my ice cream is melting and I'm frustrated with these spoons. So this time, I tell the waitress to just give me some plastic spoons. Whew, finally can dig into my butter cake. I think I'm going to start bringing my own silverware or plastic ware to restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40

Dee R.,"Downey, CA",51,255,589,3.0,4/27/2016,"Came in placed a large to go order. Ordered all lunch specials. Everything was ok, except that the order was wrong because the young guy taking to go orders didn't understand us...which we didn't know until we checked the order before walking out. Two salads were wrong and he said that there was no size difference between the cup of soup and the bowl...just that they gave you bread for $2 more. We ordered one of each and that's wrong. The bowl is larger. Kinda common sense so he should know that and not misinform people. We ended up having one salad remade and took the other incorrect one because the wait was LONG. We waited about 30 minutes for 5 lunch specials (pizza and half salads). Eh, prefer LB location to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40

She ask us to wait a minute for seating. There was another employee that walked up, never looked at us or acknowledge us . She ask the two ladies that walked in behind us to come with her so she could sit them. I told BreeAnn that was very rude.

Chelle T.,"Long Beach, CA",15,62,1,1.0,5/7/2017,"Today, my family decided to eat at CPK. Normally I have a good experience and the food is good so I said okay. The four of us walked in and the girl first tried to seat us in a cramped little booth and mind you my daughter has this big pregnant belly and I'm no skinny mini so why on earth would you put us in this child size booth? Not cool! She ends up taking us to a bigger booth. Cool. Then, this young dude comes over takes our drink order and comes back with drinks (my sangria that $10 wasn't even full, more like 3/4's full- really??) and then to take our food order. My daughter orders a BBQ chicken pizza with no onions. She even asked if it comes with onion and he said yes so she said no onions please. I order a salad with salmon and the men order their food. My daughters pizza arrives with onions and my salad no salmon. How can you mess up a simple order?? Were you even listening?? So, my hungry pregnant daughter has to wait for another pizza to be made and I have to wait for my fish. We also had to ask twice for pepper. We ended up paying over $100.00 with poor service. Next time I'll take my business elsewhere. There are plenty of places that really pay attention and provide excellent service. It just seems there are a lot of really young people working here and that's cool but they should really pay close attention and know how to attend to paying customers needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40
Kryssie B.,"Long Beach, CA",89,15,3,1.0,5/4/2016,"This review is ONLY for takeout... Got out of yoga at 9, starving knowing exactly what I wanted to eat: the amazing Mediterranean chicken. Called at 9:07 to get a to go order on my way home. Was told they don't take orders after 9. I was caught off guard and asked ""really""? And got a ""yeah, sorry, bye"" and then click. Such a bummer because I thought about this meal all day and it was on my way home. Needless to say, I'll drive the extra bit to the marketplace or Los Al in the future.

Violeta N.,"Carson, CA",4,45,38,5.0,11/2/2017,Came here on a Saturday afternoon and we got seated right away which was nice. I always forget about this location but every time I've been here (2nd time) it has been great.  Had the carne asada pizza! Sooooo happy they brought it back because it's my favorite.

V S.,"Long Beach, CA",668,38,14,2.0,10/27/2017,This is usually a decent location to come. This is however a continual issue with this cpk. You walk in and there's half of the seating available. They quote you a wait and sometimes a 30-40 min wait when there's plenty of seats. I understand rotation and not seating waiters back to back but come on cpk. Servers should be able to handle their customers as long as it's rotated.  You can easily lose customers when you have plenty of seats available. Makes no sense. Hire more servers or more efficient ones.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3
Ambitions Accessibility Club O.,"Long Beach, CA",2,64,10,3.0,10/12/2017,"The restaurant was well lit, very spacious, they had different size tables for different sized groups and people. The bathrooms were very clean, spacious, and stocked with everything. It was a nice ambiance, until the staff all joined in the front by our table yell talking (playfully) very loud. we thought it was a unprofessional to yell and talk about your personal life so loudly by the customers. Our hostess, however Danielle, was very prompt, focus and sweet. She was the only server we actually saw being dedicated to her job. The food was delicious, although $12 for a small plate of Mac N Cheese is outrageous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3
Skylar V.,"Lakewood, CA",469,155,532,5.0,8/6/2017,"CPK Lakewood was nothing short of spectacular. Service was phenomenal, our server Keylee provided the best service I've had at any California Pizza Kitchen. She went above and beyond by providing us efficient service, a great greeting smile, and was very helpful with making suggestions. I had the Kung Pao Spaghetti with Shrimp, which was proportionally distributed well with 7 shrimps glazed with the delicious sauce. I just wish the shrimp had the tails removed prior, because the tails can be a nuisance. Overall, the flavor was good, but not as good as the tequila chicken pasta I usually get. My girlfriend got the NEW Carne Asada Pizza and it was nothing short of spectacular! The green salsa you add with each slice was also delicious! Highly recommend if you love Carne Asada! My mother got traditional BBQ Chicken Pizza that is a CPK original! The flavor was top notch and was made to perfection! My mother absolutely loved it! Always a good item to choose if you are playing it safe, because it's consistently delicious. This location has plenty of mall parking, has a nice clean ambiance to it, and employees that provide excellent service! I'll definitely be back! Thanks for the great service Keylee!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3

She said it in a way that basically was against us getting the free plate. No biggie but the way the waitress worded it she really was customer service friendly about it.  On the card they present you with doesn't say you have to wait 24 hours for the reward.

Fatima K.,"Harbor City, CA",128,217,615,4.0,10/17/2016,I'm so happy that they have a sit down restaurant attached to this mall. I had to stop by the Disney store for my son's Buzz Lightyear costume. They were out of all sizes at the Del Amo mall so I had to make my way all the way down to Lakewood. The mall has a pretty small foodcourt and we were getting ready to leave the mall and head to another restaurant when we spotted a CPK. YAY! #1 BEWARE!!! The mall closes earlier than CPK so if you're parked anywhere other than the CPK entrance you're going to have to walk ALL the way around to your car bc they close all the exits. So move your car to right outside CPK. Also this mall closes early.  This location isn't a huge one but it's cute and the service was good. I prefer my regular location but this was a good experience too.  I like having an option in the mall where I can grab a salad for myself and a pizza for my son without mall hopping all around the food court.  The food was good. They made a darn good salad(BBQ chopped salad) and the butter cake was SO good!!! Honestly I think it's better than Mastro's.  Also the decor was updated and the restaurant was very clean and tidy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3

He eagerly took our drink order and suggested a few things on the menu.  We ordered the cremini mushroom and spinach flatbread to start with which was delicious!!!  I ordered a new menu item called Hearth roasted Halibut with grilled asparagus and butternut squash Farro & baby kale. The flavors were delicious!

At least there has been, lunch hour, during the week. Can't speak for weekends or holidays.  Each visit, service has been great. Different servers, both times were attentive and efficient. I'd say friendly but they were down to business for the lunch hour rush.  Food I would have to say is ok. I liked what I ordered each time however ingredient amounts were inconsistent. If you look at my pics, I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and sausage. Count the number of sausages. Anyway ... I like the open floor plan and the modern look.

Eddie P.,"Carson, CA",9,55,149,5.0,2/13/2015,"CPK is my favorite restaurant. But this CPK is my favorite of all the CPK's around. These three people always treat my family and I to the best experience each and every time. Tina, Jose (Managers) and Lina (the best server ever). Tina and Jose always make sure that the food and service is the best. They come to our table to make sure everything is going smoothly. With Lina we never have to ask her for anything, it just seems like she reads our minds and brings us what we need. For example, refills drinks, napkins, etc. She always ask us after our first bite of our food if it is cooked the way we like it. Ever since she recommended the red velvet cake with ice cream to us we always order it. I definitely recommend getting it. The food and the service from Tina, Jose and Lina are the reasons we continue to come back here. We celebrate our birthdays here, other occasions and when we just feel like having a great meal. We feel like these three individuals treat us so good just like family. We always recommend this CPK to our friends and family.

I had to ask for bread the first time and a second time when we wanted more, when again I witnessed that our booth neighbors were asked if they wanted more bread. If the bread is not part of your service and I have to ask for it, then you should not offer it. Our booth neighbors had they dirty plates withdrawn soon after their meal, while my wife and I had to sit in our neglected booth with dirty dishes and empty glasses (for the second time) trying to have a conversation. We sat in our crap booth for over 20 minutes having a conversation with empty glasses and dirty plates. The only time the server was speedy was when he delivered the bill and he did make sure to revisit us to ask if we needed anything else. I guess that way when we informed him ""No."" he could not worry about us anymore. Why did the patrons next to us receive so much better service? We were not asked how our night was or how we were doing. What a crappy anniversary dinner. Never again will I come back to this CPK!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=120

I love the new seating and color skim. I'm not the only one because I've never seen this CPK this buzzing.  We were seated within 5 mins by a cheerful greeted and our server was almost instantly at our booth to take a drink order. I tried a apple berry sangria and it was strong and tasty. For appetizer we ordered my favorite...spring rolls (Baja and Thai), yummy as always! For the main course My two year old & baby girl shared the spiral Mac and cheese which was not that bad (for kids food), while my 8 year old and I decided to split a Cesar salad and a bar-b-que chicken pizza (added bacon). The salad was honestly nothing to write about, so I won't, but the pizza was good. The bonus to this experience, is that I am a member of CPK rewards program and I had $10 off discount in my account!

Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1311,1836,312,1.0,3/23/2014,"I tried calling in my order ahead of time. I had two ""coupons"" or offers on my account -- one for ten dollars off, and another for a free birthday dessert. When I spoke to the woman on the phone, she assured me that I could use both. Since I had never used any before, I thought this was great, and I deferred to her statement, since she works for the company.  I pulled up to the designated parking area, and I called the number to say I was there. It took what seemed like forever to get someone to come out. When a person did arrive, the coupons were not on the statement. So, the girl went back in to check my account. Forever passed again. A guy came out this time, telling me that I could only use one of the coupons/offers. I said that I was told differently. He said he'd go in and ask his manager. At this point, so much time was being wasted that I just decided to walk in and take care of it at the counter. I didn't want to spend the next hour dealing with this walking back and forth from the car. Once inside, it took another twenty minutes. I was told that I was given the wrong information, and they took off the birthday cake. They printed me a new receipt and removed the dessert from my bag.  Now, I don't ""need"" a birthday cake, but I thought it was in very poor taste to take that off. Instead of wishing me a happy birthday and letting me keep the dessert for good will, the manager left a bad taste in my mouth, and I'll probably never come here again.

Laura I.,"Long Beach, CA",207,61,68,5.0,4/9/2015,"I have been to CPK many times and it has never disappointed me. I'm not fan of most chains but CPK is just downright impressive. Sure, their prices are a bit excessive but the food is actually pretty darn good. I like CPK because they put many different kinds of ingredients on their pizza, hot and/or cold. It's quite innovative - I mean, who puts cold ingredients on a warm pizza and gets away with it? Thank goodness CPK does.  Okay, so everyone talks about the pizza...well, duh...its California PIZZA Kitchen. Now, what is really underrated are the PASTAS. I love pasta...and it's really hard to compare other pastas to CPK because, again, they combine ingredients that is just nothing short of excellent. Of course it's not traditional Italian pasta but I'm basing my review on the taste of the food, not authenticity. I highly recommend their Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. It's great, get it.

Scarlet V.,"Stockholm, Sweden",69,68,135,5.0,5/24/2016,CPK is one of my favorite locations whenever there is one around.

Cindy N.,"Long Beach, CA",224,454,2695,3.0,6/2/2015,"CPK is one of those places that is kind of a last resort lol when I come here I usually get the same thing to be on the safe side because it's normally a hit and miss with the cpk menu. JERK PIZZA it's big enough to share with another person but the crust is thin so the pizza doesn't make you overwhelmingly full. The thin crust also allows the flavors to be a bit overpowering so I normally ask for easy sauce. 3 1/2 stars   BBQ CHICKEN SALAD big portion but for the price of $14 I don't thing it's worth it. Just iceberg lettuce chopped into little pieces with  corn, jicama, onions, beans, tomatoes topped with chicken. Ask for BBQ sauce and ranch on the side they tent to smother the salad in dressing. 3 stars  RED VELVET CAKE- probably one of better red velvet cakes I've ever had. It's not too sweet and the cake portion is always moist and perfect. Paired it with ice cream this last time and it was too much going on. I'll stick with just a slice of red velvet cake by itself. 4 1/2 stars  This location is big and roomy. Staff is average when it comes to service and attentiveness.

The BBQ Chicken Salad arrived, with about 1/8 cup of chicken on the top, and tomatoes bordering the rim of the plate.  It was very nicely presented.  It was delicious, too!  I think it could've used a little more chicken, but that's my only complaint.  I was shown the dessert options and chose to have the Tiramisu.  It was yummy!  If you like Tiramisu, I suggest you try theirs. All in all, it was a nice lunch.  More people started arriving to have lunch, and I noticed more servers were working as I left.  I recommend this CPK if you live by/are in the area of Lakewood.  Added bonus:  Shopping at the mall afterward (since you're already there...)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=100

When hubby and I first went to CPK Lakewood years ago, we weren't really that impressed.  A little dirty on the inside, service was okay, food was okay, but the prices didn't make it really worth it.  Since then, we come to this particular CPK around once every 2 years, and we can say that they've definitely improved.  The restaurant is a lot cleaner, the service is a bit more on point, and the food is pretty good.  Still pricey, but not bad. The salads I've had have been fresh and tasty (the one with the candied pecans/walnuts is amazing).  Also had the chiles rellenos, which was VERY good.  Hubby has had the pizzas, which are always fresh, but isn't too memorable.  Hubby has also had their pastas, which he's liked. A note on the service: definitely not bad.  But, to the employees, if you will have a fake smile, please wait for the customer to turn away before you roll your eyes or drop your smile.  It doesn't make a pleasant dining experience to see you so unhappy to be there, or not wanting to deal with customers. Overall, it's a possible place we'll go to if we're in the area.  But it's not a restaurant that completely stands out to us, or has any catching feature that would compel us to come here versus another restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=60

V S.,"Long Beach, United States",668,38,14,2.0,27/10/2017,This is usually a decent location to come. This is however a continual issue with this cpk. You walk in and there's half of the seating available. They quote you a wait and sometimes a 30-40 min wait when there's plenty of seats. I understand rotation and not seating waiters back to back but come on cpk. Servers should be able to handle their customers as long as it's rotated.  You can easily lose customers when you have plenty of seats available. Makes no sense. Hire more servers or more efficient ones.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3

Service was phenomenal, our server Keylee provided the best service I've had at any California Pizza Kitchen. She went above and beyond by providing us efficient service, a great greeting smile, and was very helpful with making suggestions. I had the Kung Pao Spaghetti with Shrimp, which was proportionally distributed well with 7 shrimps glazed with the delicious sauce. I just wish the shrimp had the tails removed prior, because the tails can be a nuisance. Overall, the flavor was good, but not as good as the tequila chicken pasta I usually get. My girlfriend got the NEW Carne Asada Pizza and it was nothing short of spectacular! The green salsa you add with each slice was also delicious! Highly recommend if you love Carne Asada! My mother got traditional BBQ Chicken Pizza that is a CPK original! The flavor was top notch and was made to perfection! My mother absolutely loved it! Always a good item to choose if you are playing it safe, because it's consistently delicious. This location has plenty of mall parking, has a nice clean ambiance to it, and employees that provide excellent service! I'll definitely be back!

Fatima K.,"Harbor City, United States",128,217,615,4.0,17/10/2016,I'm so happy that they have a sit down restaurant attached to this mall. I had to stop by the Disney store for my son's Buzz Lightyear costume. They were out of all sizes at the Del Amo mall so I had to make my way all the way down to Lakewood. The mall has a pretty small foodcourt and we were getting ready to leave the mall and head to another restaurant when we spotted a CPK. YAY! #1 BEWARE!!! The mall closes earlier than CPK so if you're parked anywhere other than the CPK entrance you're going to have to walk ALL the way around to your car bc they close all the exits. So move your car to right outside CPK. Also this mall closes early.  This location isn't a huge one but it's cute and the service was good. I prefer my regular location but this was a good experience too.  I like having an option in the mall where I can grab a salad for myself and a pizza for my son without mall hopping all around the food court.  The food was good. They made a darn good salad(BBQ chopped salad) and the butter cake was SO good!!! Honestly I think it's better than Mastro's.

JERK PIZZA it's big enough to share with another person but the crust is thin so the pizza doesn't make you overwhelmingly full. The thin crust also allows the flavors to be a bit overpowering so I normally ask for easy sauce. 3 1/2 stars   BBQ CHICKEN SALAD big portion but for the price of $14 I don't thing it's worth it. Just iceberg lettuce chopped into little pieces with  corn, jicama, onions, beans, tomatoes topped with chicken. Ask for BBQ sauce and ranch on the side they tent to smother the salad in dressing. 3 stars  RED VELVET CAKE- probably one of better red velvet cakes I've ever had. It's not too sweet and the cake portion is always moist and perfect. Paired it with ice cream this last time and it was too much going on. I'll stick with just a slice of red velvet cake by itself. 4 1/2 stars  This location is big and roomy. Staff is average when it comes to service and attentiveness.

Akisha B.,"Norwalk, United States",707,302,745,2.0,12/6/2014,"I usually don't write a review for chain restaurants, because the same foods is served at each restaurant. So when I do write a review, it has to be because of impeccable service or the opposite. Well my experience was the opposite.  My mother and I are seated, given menus and then order is taken. We knew what we wanted, so we ordered right away. (Lunch menu: 7"" mushroom and spinach pizza and Mediterranean salad for $10.95) Now maybe you have to request for a basket of bread and oil, but we weren't offered any. And the fact that other tables were given bread and oil,  just kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Our food arrives, and we have no napkins. Our waitress never came to check on us. We only seen her when we ordered our food and when it was time to pay for our food. So customer service here was WACK! Don't get me wrong, the waitress was nice when we did see her, but she did a terrible job checking on us. And what really sealed the deal, given spoons 4 times and each time the spoon was dirty. So it's dessert time. I ordered the butter cake with ice cream. 5 stars just for this dessert. The butter cake is oh so good! Ok, now back to the dirty spoons. With our dessert, we are given a spoon. The spoon had dried up cheese, and the other spoon has dried up food particles on the handle. ""Gross! I'm not putting my mouth on those spoons."" So we ask for two more spoons. What do you know, both spoons are dirty. ""Dang, do y'all wash these utensils? "" Apparently not! At this point my ice cream is melting and I'm frustrated with these spoons. So this time, I tell the waitress to just give me some plastic spoons. Whew, finally can dig into my butter cake. I think I'm going to start bringing my own silverware or plastic ware to restaurants.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40

Two salads were wrong and he said that there was no size difference between the cup of soup and the bowl...just that they gave you bread for $2 more. We ordered one of each and that's wrong. The bowl is larger. Kinda common sense so he should know that and not misinform people. We ended up having one salad remade and took the other incorrect one because the wait was LONG.

Not cool! She ends up taking us to a bigger booth. Cool. Then, this young dude comes over takes our drink order and comes back with drinks (my sangria that $10 wasn't even full, more like 3/4's full- really??) and then to take our food order. My daughter orders a BBQ chicken pizza with no onions. She even asked if it comes with onion and he said yes so she said no onions please. I order a salad with salmon and the men order their food. My daughters pizza arrives with onions and my salad no salmon. How can you mess up a simple order?? Were you even listening?? So, my hungry pregnant daughter has to wait for another pizza to be made and I have to wait for my fish. We also had to ask twice for pepper. We ended up paying over $100.00 with poor service.

Then we got to place our order. So we were waiting waiting.. I appreciate that she's telling us that it'll be out in a few minutes cause orders are kind of backed up.

Grace C.,"Anaheim, United States",50,843,1158,3.0,3/2/2015,"During the times that CPK has been around, hubby and I wasn't always impressed.  For the most part, it felt like over-priced pizzas compared to what I used to be able to make at home.  But, if one of our friends requested to go to a CPK, we would still go to at least see how the franchise is holding up. When hubby and I first went to CPK Lakewood years ago, we weren't really that impressed.  A little dirty on the inside, service was okay, food was okay, but the prices didn't make it really worth it.  Since then, we come to this particular CPK around once every 2 years, and we can say that they've definitely improved.  The restaurant is a lot cleaner, the service is a bit more on point, and the food is pretty good.  Still pricey, but not bad. The salads I've had have been fresh and tasty (the one with the candied pecans/walnuts is amazing).  Also had the chiles rellenos, which was VERY good.  Hubby has had the pizzas, which are always fresh, but isn't too memorable.  Hubby has also had their pastas, which he's liked. A note on the service: definitely not bad.  But, to the employees, if you will have a fake smile, please wait for the customer to turn away before you roll your eyes or drop your smile.  It doesn't make a pleasant dining experience to see you so unhappy to be there, or not wanting to deal with customers. Overall, it's a possible place we'll go to if we're in the area.  But it's not a restaurant that completely stands out to us, or has any catching feature that would compel us to come here versus another restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=60

Lisa S.,"Long Beach, United States",1311,1836,312,1.0,23/3/2014,"I tried calling in my order ahead of time. I had two ""coupons"" or offers on my account -- one for ten dollars off, and another for a free birthday dessert. When I spoke to the woman on the phone, she assured me that I could use both. Since I had never used any before, I thought this was great, and I deferred to her statement, since she works for the company.  I pulled up to the designated parking area, and I called the number to say I was there. It took what seemed like forever to get someone to come out. When a person did arrive, the coupons were not on the statement. So, the girl went back in to check my account. Forever passed again. A guy came out this time, telling me that I could only use one of the coupons/offers. I said that I was told differently. He said he'd go in and ask his manager. At this point, so much time was being wasted that I just decided to walk in and take care of it at the counter. I didn't want to spend the next hour dealing with this walking back and forth from the car. Once inside, it took another twenty minutes. I was told that I was given the wrong information, and they took off the birthday cake. They printed me a new receipt and removed the dessert from my bag.  Now, I don't ""need"" a birthday cake, but I thought it was in very poor taste to take that off. Instead of wishing me a happy birthday and letting me keep the dessert for good will, the manager left a bad taste in my mouth, and I'll probably never come here again.

Sure, their prices are a bit excessive but the food is actually pretty darn good. I like CPK because they put many different kinds of ingredients on their pizza, hot and/or cold. It's quite innovative - I mean, who puts cold ingredients on a warm pizza and gets away with it? Thank goodness CPK does.  Okay, so everyone talks about the pizza...well, duh...its California PIZZA Kitchen. Now, what is really underrated are the PASTAS. I love pasta...and it's really hard to compare other pastas to CPK because, again, they combine ingredients that is just nothing short of excellent. Of course it's not traditional Italian pasta but I'm basing my review on the taste of the food, not authenticity. I highly recommend their Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. It's great, get it.

I work at a nearby hospital and often come here on a weekly basis, with coworkers once our shift is done. The fresh and delicious food really hits the spot after a long day!!  And, I have to be honest... it is so nice to receive such personal and attentive service, after caring for patients all day!! Often times, when I go out to eat - I am truly embarrassed to order - because I often have to make complicated changes to the dishes... I am never embarrassed here! The wait staff and management have gone above and beyond to meet my dietary needs and accommodate me. They are genuinely happy to make my experience perfect!  Everyone is wonderful. I am particularly fond of Vanessa. She has my order practically memorized and always greets my friends and I with a big smile!! It's the little things like keeping my water filled and bringing things/anticipating our needs. Thank you Vanessa and everyone else for making every visit so pleasant.

Ordered a pepperoni pizza for i think $13.99. It came with 6 slices. If you like thin crust pizza this place is for you but i prefer pan pizza. Going to a pizza restaurant, i kind of expected pan pizza or at least an option of pan or thin. But the pizza was still good, the pepporonis were huge and it was just the good amount of greasy. The pepper in the shakers they offered were really spicy, which i liked. The pizza was a perfect size for my boyfriend and i to finish.  Would i come back? Maybe to try their pastas. Although their iced tea was good. I think i'll stick with BJ's for pizza or even round table.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=80

The BBQ Chicken Salad arrived, with about 1/8 cup of chicken on the top, and tomatoes bordering the rim of the plate.  It was very nicely presented.  It was delicious, too!  I think it could've used a little more chicken, but that's my only complaint.  I was shown the dessert options and chose to have the Tiramisu.  It was yummy!  If you like Tiramisu, I suggest you try theirs. All in all, it was a nice lunch.  More people started arriving to have lunch, and I noticed more servers were working as I left.  I recommend this CPK if you live by/are in the area of Lakewood.  Added bonus:  Shopping at the mall afterward (since you're already there...)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=100

I had to ask for bread the first time and a second time when we wanted more, when again I witnessed that our booth neighbors were asked if they wanted more bread. If the bread is not part of your service and I have to ask for it, then you should not offer it. Our booth neighbors had they dirty plates withdrawn soon after their meal, while my wife and I had to sit in our neglected booth with dirty dishes and empty glasses (for the second time) trying to have a conversation. We sat in our crap booth for over 20 minutes having a conversation with empty glasses and dirty plates. The only time the server was speedy was when he delivered the bill and he did make sure to revisit us to ask if we needed anything else. I guess that way when we informed him ""No."" he could not worry about us anymore. Why did the patrons next to us receive so much better service?

Chine C.,"Long Beach, United States",83,32,19,4.0,20/7/2014,I love the food it's always good and very fresh. Service is always pretty good. Place is most often busy so that can change how fast you get your food. But I've never been disappointed.  Love the pizza we've tired most of them. Best salad the chicken Waldorf.  Only negative would be sometimes it's loud and noisy in there.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=120
