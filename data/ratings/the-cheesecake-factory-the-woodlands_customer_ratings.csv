My wife had already gotten up to talk to the manager when the server asked me for our drink order.  I will say that once we got his attention, our server did an excellent job.  It is a shame that we got off to such a bad start, because I don't believe I will repeat this location either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=200,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.24,3.1600000000000006

165,Robyn H.,"Houston, TX",4,80,35.0,3.0,2012-12-19,"I've visited Cheesecake Factory in many different locations in many different parts of the country and I'd say that this location was not bad, but also not the best location that I've been to. It might just come down to the fact that it was really loud. I know that Cheesecakes are usually on the loud side, but this restaurant was especially bad. Seemed like everyone was having a birthday and getting sung to for it. This was actually my birthday too but the dh was told in no uncertain terms that he would find himself walking home if he even thought about it. ;) Anyways, the service was good. We only had to wait 10 minutes and there were open seats at the bar. Although I felt for the bartender because it was just her for the entire (and packed) restaurant. CF for pete's sake, get 2 people behind the bar! Our server was friendly, possibly too friendly and too in the weeds because he talked so fast that it was hard to keep up. He really seemed to enjoy his job though so I can't fault him for enthusiasm. He got our orders perfect as well. Everything was very efficient. Now for the food: that's why you go there right? Anyways, so I've been craving french fries and saw them on someone else's table so I got them as an appetizer ... very unoriginal I know, so sue me! They were seriously the best fries I've had in a long time and they came in what seemed like a never-ending bowl! They were served hot ... excellent! They were nice and crispy but not overcooked. No soggy fries here. And they were lightly salted. Let's just say that I filled up on fries so that by the time the food arrived I was already full! Oops! Good thing they make to-go boxes. For the main course I had the Romano chicken with pasta. I have to say that I've had better versions of this. There was waaaay too much sauce and the chicken was not well presented. When I had it for lunch the next day ... yes I did ... there were pieces of bacon on the underside of the chicken. It's a good thing that I'm not against eating pork. They should really clean the pans before cooking each food item. The dh had a pork chops and he said that they were okay. Not bad but not great. I tried something different for desert and got the cheesecake with strawberries. I didn't realize that the strawberries would be the glazed kind, so they were too artificial tasting for my preference. I'll stick to plain from now on. All in all, it was a good experience even though the food was only so-so. Then again those fries ... I'll be back for them!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=200,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.532,3.1200000000000006

This was our first time to a Cheesecake Factory and our first place out since we moved to Texas. We were seated right away and we liked the ambiance. Our waiter was new but was nice and attentive.  The menu was gigantic! We had the crab rangoons for an app and they were just ok. I'm used the mixture inside being a little sweeter so I might not order these again. My fiancé had the pasta carbonara and I had the ahi tuna as my entree. They brought me the wrong entree and I guess it was entered incorrectly so we had to wait for mine to be made, but that was ok. It was soo delish. And of course we had to order cheesecake!! I had the white chocolate blueberry and my man had the dark chocolate raspberry. Both were great. When we received the bill the incorrect entree that was entered was also on our bill.

They seemed a bit disorganized, and after a few minutes or slightly more acknowledged us and put down place setting, which to be honest a cloth napkin placed down on the bar top as a placemat seems rather insulting, just let me eat at the bar top and you can wipe it down after I'm done or better yet you should be any ways and not rely on the ""placemat"" to do the job for you. Mine was already nicely strawberry stained, really nothing that mattered too much to me.  We placed out orders in, I'd really only wanted to come here for dessert but after browsing the menu found I wanted a few light bites. The Zucchini and Sliders were the perfect amount of food to be split between me and my company. The chopped zucchini pieces were great not overly breaded. The sliders were a bit greasy, and the meat was charred to burnt around the edges, there was close to no grilled onions on them, though a note you could add cheese to them if you liked.  After the light bit of munchies, I finally awaited to place my order for my main reason, dessert. I think I went through about 2.5 glasses of water until finally someone asked me if there was something else I wanted. I kick myself because I could easily make a whole FRESH cheesecake of my own taste and liking from scratch at home for about what they charge for a slice, but eh everyone is entitled to be lazy. My dessert finally came, being sick I tasted nothing, Oii, and yet I so wanted nothing more than dessert, though my other half said it was good, his taste buds are questionable, haha!  The bartender had went on a banter when I got there about the amount of tipping was conducive to the quality of service, needless to say one I don't think you need to say that out loud and two don't provide less than stellar serive to the next patrons based on what your last guests tipped, just saying!

I'm giving it 3 stars simply for the menu concentration, price to freshness of food served. It just seems to me, someone couldn't make up there mind in what they wanted and just kept adding. There food cost has to be absorbent. There is no way they serve this amount of fresh food daily. So at this point eating seafood in the middle of the week was a little suspect. Yet, I truly believe to be the great 4 & 5 rated star restaurants, you should serve any menu item any day of the week and it remains consistent, fresh and inviting. We had spinach artichoke dip, dynamite shrimp, fried calamari to start us off. All was great typical appetizer, would not say best in town, but not disappointing. Unfortunately, this day the shrimp had a slight bitter taste in my shrimp scampi/steak Diane. Also the wine sauce, tasted like yesterday's redo. The Food service was excellent, he did his job well...

Just do it..go.    It is the best burger I have had (outside of real Kobe in Hawaii) and even husband and son(burger gurus) agree it is the best.   Of course there is always a wait if you go at peak times so we avoid those.  My one complaint is they allow pick up phone in orders BUT when they are very busy they will transfer your call to pick up (cheesecake desk) and never ever answer it.  I assume they know pick up is not a priority and I get that.  .  I just wish they would just forego offering pick up rather than be rude to a customer on the phone by refusing to pick up the transfer  Service is usually phenomenal once you are seated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands?start=200,4.04,4.04,4.04,2.7039999999999997,4.04

I think everyone did that night because the poor waiters must have sung Happy Birthday 7 times while we were there - and I kindly asked them not to sing to me because I was tired of hearing it. Staff was up beat and cheerful, and the ambiance was a 10. The food was sadly disappointing! The teriyaki chicken was bland and looked thrown together on the plate. The fish tacos had zero flavor - although the plate looked fabulous, it was a snooze fest to the taste buds. The kids had chicken tenders and fries and even those were border line inedible. And then came the cheesecake - the one saving grace of the evening. Maybe that's why they call it the Cheesecake Factory instead of the Really Good Food Factory.

112,Grace B.,"Houston, TX",5,25,36.0,4.0,2014-10-28,"My dad and I have never eaten at The Cheesecake Factory, but we've always heard about. So one day, during a trip to the Woodlands Mall, we went on a spontaneous food date to the Cheesecake Factory.  The wait wasn't long, and the service was pretty nice. They offered free bread as we waited for our food, and although it didn't look appetizing it was certainly delicious. I guess brown bread with oats encrusted on the top, appears to look bland but it wasn't at all.  Our waiter Jacob was pleasant, and he was easy to talk to. We were able to have funny small conversations and he was flexible and patient with us.  Onto the food, I had an herb crusted Salmon and my dad had ""The Everything Pizza"". My salmon was AWESOME! It was served on top of delicious mashed potatoes with a creamy but twisty-tangy sauce. The sauce is to die for! I don't know how to describe it, but it had an slight  citrus lemon sour taste. I'm guessing they used Greek yogurt? I also believe they used farm raised Salmon, since the fish was a light pink instead of a rich deep pink.  The ""everything"" pizza, had a nice crust and it was also delicious. The only thing I would have preferred was the order without kalamata olives. (DISCLAIMER: the Cheesecake Factory gives you the option of having olives or not) My dad wanted olives on it, which wasn't the best idea because the olives made the pizza even more saltier than it already was. The crust was pretty amazing though, to make up for the saltiness. I wasn't as crazy about the pizza as my salmon. I can imagine the margherita pizza to be waaaaay better. I also wish we were seated some where more private. We were pretty close to another party next to us. It kind of felt like a community table. The place was kind of noisy, but we could deal with it.  I would give this place an overall score of 4.5 out of 5. Mainly because of the pizza and the privacy of the tables.  I wish we were able to try a cheesecake!!! The lunch portions were soooo big, we didn't have enough room in our tummies to stuff a cheesecake down.

133,Amber C.,"Spring, TX",14,24,,2.0,2015-01-20,"After my disappointing experience at lunch today I feel as I need to review this restaurant. Normally I would give this restaurant at least 3 1/2 stars. The food is usually fairly good - not excellent - but good and the service is usually fairly okay as well. Enough that I return from time to time to enjoy the skinny chicken enchiladas which prior to today have always come out hot and delicious. HOWEVER, it may be a long while before I return to this location. Today, we were attended to by a server with zero energy or personality. No smile - just rote, monotone service. Okay, whatever, I don't need to be entertained anyway but it is nice to have a pleasant server. The disappointing part was that while my husbands shepherds pie came out piping hot and tasted delicious (to be fair), my skinny chicken enchiladas were barely lukewarm. We brought it to the attention of the server who took it back to the kitchen to take care of it. The manager shortly came out and stated that they were remaking them right away. Great - I'm hungry. Anyway, I had the pleasure of watching my husband enjoy his entire portion of shepherds pie before my food returned. It was very hot and good but by then I was pretty full of bread and veggies so only was able to really eat a little of the enchiladas. When the manager followed up to ask how it was my husband reminded him that although it was much better, it still came out very late. The manager simply apologized again lol. He offered no discount - nothing- not even a free dessert or something. Most restaurants won't even make you pay for the meal in a case like this. I hope they weren't waiting for me to ask for them to take it off because if I have to ask, then this is not a restaurant I will continue to waste my money and time with.

The Cheesecake is amazing. I would give it a 5 by itself. However... the meals we ordered was not good, so I wanted to give it a 1 star. So averaging the two, I came up with a 3. We should have suspected that the meal menu wouldn't be to good, because it's huge. You know how when you go to a buffet that has too much stuff on it? Most of it isn't very good because they don't focus one kind of dish. This is true of Cheesecake Factory. They have a huge menu. I've heard the burgers are good (after we ate there), but we ordered some Italian food. It was probably the worst pasta I have ever eaten. The cheesecake for dessert made up for it, as it was delicious.

A lunch menu is available with items such as soup and salad.  The portions are smaller and the soup is always delicious.   We all opted for soup and or salad or both.  The warm bread basket never disappoints.  The chopped salad was a winner.  Too full for dessert but maybe next time.

I cut into the steak and it was again well done, someone else brought out a plate of mashed potatoes shortly after and i asked them just to take my meal off my ticket, they obviously can't cook steak. I could not find my waiter for 20 minutes during all this also. We finally got the check and someone brings out a whole new dish plate with everything on it! Why didn't you bring it out 30 minutes ago when there was an issue in the first place, it must have been sitting in the kitchen this whole time or something, I don't know what was going on.

We were immediately seated in a booth, and our waiter came shortly after. I ordered their house side salad as an appetizer, and I must say their house vinaigrette is one of the BEST I've had (next to La Madeline's raspberry vinaigrette)! It was seasoned but not overwhelming. I practically scraped the plate. :D We were also served fresh warm bread to go with the salad. I love their wheat bread which reminds me of the same type of bread that Outback serves- delish! Our entrees consisted of the popular chicken Madeira and the gluten free angel hair shrimp pasta. I can see why the chicken Madeira is popular because it has a mixture of flavors. My husband really like his pasta as well. He said the shrimp had a buttery taste to them, and they were large. Honestly, there were so many things to choose from, it was hard to decide! They had meals to fit anyone's taste buds, ranging from Tex Mex, to comfort food or Italian. There were even ""light choices"" in case you wanted to indulge in the sweets (wink). Lastly, of course I had dessert, but that had to be on the go- I was stuffed.

For our main course, we ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and Spicy Chipotle Chicken. After our order was taken, things started to go downhill. We waited about 15 minutes and never received the sourdough and sweet multigrain bread that would normally come within 5 minutes of being seated. Our appetizers came and immediately after taking the first bite, we realized that the Samosas were full of salt. When we asked about the bread, we were told that they had ran out of bread and were waiting to get more. New people came and were seated next to us. They were served with bread immediately. Next, our food arrived, but the bread still didn't come. We had to request the food server (not our waiter) this time that we never received the bread and she said she would bring it. The bread ended up coming after the food had arrived.

34,Troy M.,"Houston, TX",2,21,12.0,2.0,2016-10-29,"1st time to eat here (or any Cheesecake Factory). Our waitress was prompt to greet us, but was very quick to say she didn't know why they gave us a kids menu, they are only for 10 and under and that my youngest daughter could not order from it. Pretty bold considering she never asked how old my daughter was (she is 11).  I told her that we have never been prevented from using kids menus in the past and that my daughter doesn't eat large portions and prefers the kids menu choices. The waitress responds ""I don't make the rules"" and tells us the lunch specials are discounted and match the kids menu portion size, but reiterated she cannot have anything from the kids menu.  My daughter is a picky eater and so the only thing she could find she wanted on the adult menu (not offered in a lunch portion) was the eggs/ham/etc plate.   When the food came she had to ask for another bagel as hers was burned. The waitress did acknowledge that by apologizing and saying ""they never should have plated that"". The portions sizes are huge so of course my daughter ate only 20% of it and was full. I had the Louisiana Chicken & Pasta dish and it was absolutely fabulous (5 stars for the food).  When the waitress picked up our plates I pointed out the extreme food waste on my daughter's plate and mentioned again why the kids menu would have been a better choice. She double downed that she didn't make the rules she only follows them.  We had all ordered waters with our meal because we like to eat healthy and avoiding soda is a good way to offset the amount of sugar we were planning to have trying cheesecake slices for desert.  Unfortunately after the tiff over the children's menu I was regretting that we even stayed and ate so I didn't want to pad this waitress's tip anymore than I had to.  She still got close to 18% tip because I understand that may also go to other staff who had nothing to do with this.   I liked the atmosphere & my food was great, but the hard line policy that creates food waste and limited choices for my sweet 11yo presented with a little snarky attitude from our waitress sealed the deal on a lower score and us never returning to Cheesecake Factory.  The girls enjoyed Marble Slab for desert just up the mall.  PS: I'm sure this is completely unrelated but I'll post just in case it happens to anyone else here (which would then be something to investigate) - after I ate here for lunch I was a victim of credit card fraud on the card I used later that evening.

The flavors were good, a light peanut sauce drizzle over the chicken with  fresh vegetables cradled by crisp lettuce. The two sauces it came with were more than enough, though a bit overwhelmingly sweet. However, preparation of this dish was lacking, as I soon realized the tacos were loaded with another secret ingredient--water. As much as I appreciate crisp lettuce, I also appreciate dry arms and sleeves. After learning from the first taco, I made sure to pour out the water before taking a bite with the last two.  Of course, the meal ended on a sweet note when our table shared the vanilla bean and the kahlua cheesecakes--decadent enough to satisfy any craving of rich dense cheesecake for a good stretch of time.

Service was gracious and accommodating.  Drinks were served quickly with our lunch order arriving shortly thereafter.  Advice:  if you are not a heavy lunch eater -- order from the Appetizer menu.  Even those portions are huge, but nothing compared to the regular meals. Tex-Mex Eggrolls were good (albeit slightly greasy) with a flavorful avocado/sour cream dip.  A big thumbs-up on the children's menu offerings:  good eats for the kids with and optional side of fresh fruit.  Fresh fruit it was:  small diced pineapple, sliced strawberries and blueberries.  Lucious! The cheesecake selection is, quite obviously, their signature line.  When I saw the consistency and presentation of the slice of cheesecake my son ordered, I knew why this was a favorite spot of his.  Definitely eat lightly if you want a slice of any of their cheesecake for dessert, that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands,2.8,3.13,3.13,2.7039999999999997,2.9979999999999998

So much so that people kept going inside because of the trash and everything under tables. My dad even went to let a manager know.

The ornamentation and decorations were over the top and even a little gaudy, but that was really where the negatives came to a screeching halt. Much like other Cheesecake Factory franchises, seating was ample and service was relaxed and unhurried at the early dinner hour we arrived. That's not to say we were ignored; our hostess and waitress were spot on throughout our meal to make sure we were well attended.  I ordered the fried shrimp and fries, expecting a standard boardwalk basket-sized meal. Instead, my husband and I both goggled at the site of a plate that took up half our two-seater table. Best of all, it was well done. The shrimp were fresh, well-battered, and piping hot while some fries even had residual oil bubbles, signifying their swim in the baptismal fryer only seconds ago.  There was enough of my meal to be enjoyed both at the restaurant and later for a second dinner at home, which was much appreciated in the age of tiny courses and big plates. Prices are surprisingly reasonable, considering the sheer volume of food on the plate, and the menu is straightforward, approachable American fare. With both the mall and Waterway within walkable distance, there are some great options for postprandial walks.

My coffee, when presented to me was cold and old. I asked for a fresh cup. Our waiter said no problem. However, what I didn't hear him mumble was that he would heat it up. He brought it back heated up. I ask for a fresh cup, and he explained it would be awhile, a bit later he brought me a ""fresh"" cup only it still had an old coffee taste to it. Moving on to dinner, our entrees where served and all was well. We ask for additional bread, which did not show up until half-way thru our entrees. Our waiter showed more interests to the parties all around us. I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my coffee or water. We did inform our waiter we where celebrating my aunt's 66th birthday, his reply was ""Uhhh Happy Birthday"". He turned from us and gathered other staffers to sing happy birthday to that table. Then, turn back to us and asked of we needed to-go containers. No offer of desert. For heavens sake, I would have thought he would at least offer for us to buy what the restaurant is named after. We paid our bill and tipped him 15% against our better judgement.  We met up with the manager at the Cheesecake display and informed her of our service. She did apologized and offered my aunt a slice if cheesecake for the inconvenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands,2.96,3.03,3.03,,3.002
12,George W.,"Humble, TX",9,15,7.0,5.0,2017-11-06,"This place is incredible! Staff is always friendly & attentive. The food! OMG the food! My wife & I have been here at least 6 or 7 times & get something different every time. It's so good we're wanting to try a wide variety, but it's hard because the burgers are my weakness. Lets not forget about the cheesecake. The cheesecake is ""last meal"" worthy. My personal favorite has to be the Oreo cheesecake & the Reese's cheesecake. The price can get up there for 2 people if ordering apps, meals, & desserts, but it's so worth it. Also, don't go here if you're counting calories. This is a place you go if you're wanting a serious cheat meal. Even the salads are high in calories, but like I said, worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands,3.08,3.03,3.03,,3.05
1,Elena A.,"Harrisburg, PA",40,15,3.0,4.0,2017-11-29,"I have ALWAYS loved The Cheesecake Factory but I hardly ever get to go. Visiting with friends we decided to hit this spot after a day of shopping in a local village.  We were originally told our wait time would be about 20 or so minutes and 10 minutes later we were being called to sit down. YAY!  Our server was amazing...  Andrew, I think his name was...  he was kind and helpful and he even put up with our tired crazy silliness.  He joked right in with us.  Drinks were YUM. Food was YUM. Appetizers were YUM. Atmosphere was amazing. We just had an all around fantastic experience!  Thank you!!!!! Keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands,3.2,3.06,3.06,,3.1160000000000005
10,Sarah B.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,5.0,2017-12-31,"I am skeptical of these types of franchises. However, the Cheesecake Factory has (for the most part) given me exceptional service at an affordable price. Just yesterday I went there and had such amazing service and food. John Beck made sure that we were taken care of, when it was obvious that the place was packed. The chicken Alfredo melted in my mouth, and thankfully my friend let me taste the carne asada. Amazing! Thank you, John! And thank you Cheesecake Factory",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands,3.28,3.1,3.1,,3.1720000000000006

Portions are generally large enough to share which is perfect for us.  Don't forget to leave room for dessert... again, lots of options.   Wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  A big factor for us.   Great location, with quick walking distance to mall, Cinemark movie theater and other shopping.  Can't ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-the-woodlands,3.28,3.1,3.1,,3.1720000000000006
