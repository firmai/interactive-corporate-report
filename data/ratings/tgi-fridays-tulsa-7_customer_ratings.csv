6,Cindy D.,"Tulsa, OK",197,139,591.0,3.0,2014-04-26,"I haven't been here for quite awhile because they took away the Oreo madness. I'm back today because I got a coupon in the mail for a free dessert. And one of the desserts was Oreo madness! So, here I am  again. I ordered a French dip sandwich and a side salad. The sandwich was good, the french fries were good, and the salad was good. My husband thought the portions were small but they were fine to me. Then we got the oreo. Not the same. It was a disappointment. Since that is what I came for, I'm not a satisfied customer. The food was good but not memorable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
12,Londie R.,"Spring, TX",29,26,18.0,1.0,2014-05-02,I can go through a laundry lists of problems but I'll save you time and give you a few.  Service was sub-par with our waiter not coming to check on us throughout the meal.  Glad we wasn't dying of thirst b/c our glasses went empty and he sure didn't seem to care to fill them up again.  Food tasted like it was frozen food and I was starving and the first bite killed my appetite because it tasted terrible.  I mentioned how it tasted and our waiter did NOTHING to make it better.  Will NEVER go back to this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
7,Keith J.,"Tulsa, OK",39,52,86.0,4.0,2014-05-04,"I've been eating at Friday's for about 10 years now. This Friday's i wouldn't recommend going to because. 1st the waiter used my fiance and i as his own personal venting ear & shoulder to whine on, about how hard his day has been. I understand people have hard day's, but i'm not paying my hard earned money to be hearing about someone else's hard day.  We ordered the New York strip, med well, with garlic mash potatoes. When our food came out about 25 minutes later, my fiance's steak was under cooked (still bloody) so we told the waiter and he kinda huffed cause he had to take it back to the kitchen to get it done properly. So the whole time were waiting for her steak to come back out mine was getting cold. He brought it back out and apologized, but it was a disgusted apology as though he was forced to do it. If you've ever eaten at Friday's, you know they bring ketchup with every steak, and my ketchup had hair in it (so naturally i didn't use it). We got done eating, and the waiter asked if we wanted any desserts, and we told him ""no thank you"" and he actually looked upset that we weren't getting anything else besides the check. When we got the check there was no discount of any sort for the two mistakes that we had experienced at this friday's so needless to say we will not return back to this friday's we will go find one somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
9,Dea D.,"Kansas City, MO",47,113,264.0,4.0,2014-05-05,"Went here for a date night with my fiance and it wasn't very busy which is always a plus when your having a date night and you like things a bit more on the quiet side rather then the loud side.  Their steak was yummy but the first time i got it..it was bloody and i asked for med. well...so he took it back and it got cooked until it was how i asked. The waiter kept coming over to us talking about his ""long day of work"" and how exhausted he is...Ok that's fine thank you for informing us, now please move along so we can enjoy our date night (not that i said that, but i would of liked to)  After the 5th or 6th time he did this i was convinced that our date night wasn't going to end up the way i had thought since there wasn't a lot of customers being loud...owell. I also went for the ketchup and noticed that there was hair on the bottle and the lid had old guncked up ketchup that was mending the hair to stay in place...yuck!  overall the meal was tasty but i would of liked less venting from our waiter and cleaner ketchup bottles lol it might of been late at night but us late nighters still would like to be left alone and have cleaner service. :) BTW: The price was a bit high for their food, but the taste was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
11,Kay T.,"Muskogee, OK",0,22,,2.0,2014-11-04,"Not sure we will go back. They say they have a soup of the day but when I asked I got laughed at and said yeah we don't, that needs to be taken down. They acted odd about my husbands service dog. The young lady waiting on us was rude and just seemed unhappy to be at work. Just over all a blah experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
8,Grumpy H.,"Catoosa, OK",36,295,46.0,4.0,2014-11-28,"The food was really good.  We had the french dip (great horseradish spread on it but the bun could have been a little more toasty - it's sort of weird seeing a white roll).  The sweet potato fries were a nice sidedish.   The french onion soup was good.  The chicken parm was great with the mac/cheese. Chicken fingers were crunchy, hot and tasty.  The Jack Daniels burger was super! The Service?  Super!  Shelkayla was completely professional and a joy to converse with.  The servers were polite and the attention from the manager and bartender was just great!   The prices were a little much for the portions but the overall dinner we had with all the attentiveness made for a very pleasant dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
5,Brittany B.,"Clarksville, TN",0,29,8.0,2.0,2015-05-10,"Service is sooooooo slooooooow. 40 minutes since placing an order, I'm still waiting. It isn't even very busy.  Lots of complaints with the food. Not just from my table, either. Looks like they are under new management and he's trying to turn it around. Very nice guy. We will give the place another try once he's had a little time to make improvements.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
3,Jenni H.,"Tulsa, OK",16,40,2.0,1.0,2015-07-20,"This place is just pathetic. It survives off of coupons, bribes of free food for giving decent ratings to corporate and extraordinarily late night hours.   The service is always horrible with ridiculous wait times and ""overloaded"" servers that can not handle customers even when the restaurant is empty. Some of the most unprofessional servers I've ever seen at any restaurant..  Some times they do not have food items on the menu ""cooked"" and report those items as unavailable.  Other times food is brought out raw or burnt which was the case with my kids' food today. The restaurant is filthy. If you're a transvestite, just got done mowing your lawn or just generally look like shit on a particular day this place could be a good option for you though.  I've been to other TGI Fridays in other states that seemed pretty good, but I really need to remember to at least avoid the Eton square location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
1,Mary H.,"Tulsa, OK",67,93,183.0,3.0,2015-07-28,"Poor poor service!!! Seated promptly and host was friendly! Seated in bar section, 1 guest during lunch. Took 20min to get my drink and food ordered. 1/2 Cali club and house salad. Salad-lettuce I had cut down, huge pieces that were not shredded, cheese, croton Sandwich was good, bread a little hard, little dry, but it was fine. Not once did I get refill on my drink till I was leaving. Waited 8 minutes on my check to leave. Wasn't busy, so no excuse! Everyone looked disoriented and chaos! Bring food out the kitchen asking people at each table ""is this yours?"" WTF!!! I'm irritated bc short lunch break taken over by these horrible wait staff!  UGHH every time I think it will eve different, nope!! Same crappy SVC and I  this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
0,Willie R.,"Washington, DC",83,313,465.0,3.0,2015-11-25,"I'm rating this TGIF location as three stars based on the several visits I have made here over time, rather than the less than excellent visit I had last night.  Generally speaking, their food is quite fresh, but this is only the case if you come during the daytime. We came around 11pm, after an evening flight, and it was a completely different world. I recall it having been a little difficult in the past to find our server, but last night was ridiculous. The young lady was friendly and did come by once to refill drinks, but other than that, she completely disappeared. I'm thinking they were cleaning up for the evening or something, although she was very chatty with some guys at the bar (the only other patrons, as this place was d-e-a-d) when she WAS present. When we were finished, we had to actually go find someone to bring our check. We stumbled upon a cook, who said he would ""try to find someone,"" and after three minutes a different waitress appeared.  The food has traditionally been pretty good for what it is, although last night's was lackluster. I had the Jack Daniel Burger, medium-well, with avocado (because why not?) and sweet potato fries. The burger was kinda hot but kinda tepid, the buns were way overly toasted, and the avocado tasted old. The sweet potato fries were just OK (I'm used to good SP fries when I'm in Oklahoma, so they were honestly disappointing). My dad ordered a Jack Daniel Steak, well done, with ribs and regular fries. The steak and ribs were solid, although the fries were all almost completely drenched in the Jack Daniels sauce. They were soggy, so he asked to be brought some new fries. The ""new"" fries were basically cold. He had also ordered a strawberry lemonade, which is normally pretty good at this location, but this time it was basically a glass of lemonade with about two drops of artificial strawberry. They brought out a new one, which was quite a bit better.  If I'm coming in on a late flight again, I'll try to find another place to eat as this service is pretty bad in the late evening. But if it's during the day, they are still A-OK by me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
4,Bruce G.,"Tulsa, OK",1,12,,1.0,2015-11-25,I was the first person seated for lunch. The place was deserted. I had the first order submitted to the kitchen. I ordered a burger and the waitress asked if I would like it 'pink' and I said yes. The burger I got was a lump of coal.  I cannot imagine how badly the cook would screw up if there were a big crowd of people to cook for.  I will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
10,Darin M.,"Owasso, OK",31,4,,1.0,2016-05-14,"I took my kid here following her graduation on Friday night May 13th. We had a few friends and family so we called ahead to make sure they could handle our group of 12, was told no problem. Needless to say, the service was horrible and we had to many times goes to the drink station and refill our drinks. Took over an hour to get our food and when it came out it was cold and most every order was wrong. 45 mins into waiting the waitress came out to say they couldn't make the nachos one person ordered (really nachos?)  after complaining and waiting for a manager we were given every excuse why they sucked so bad, they took 20% off the bill, we paid $200 for shit food and service. Standing outside with everyone talking another group came out, they were 100% comped. Talk about feeling screwed twice! Thanks for ruining 2hrs of our time and ruining a special night for my daughter. If I could give negative stars you deserve-5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
2,Michelle C.,"McKinney, TX",145,519,1852.0,3.0,2016-05-21,"Wish the service was a but better at this place. I can't complain about the food too much. I always can't get enough of TGIF. But if you must get some Friday's make sure you just get it togo, save the money on tip because the service isn't all that great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tulsa-7,,,,,
