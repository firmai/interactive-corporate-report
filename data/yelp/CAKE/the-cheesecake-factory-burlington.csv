Gigi M.,"Milford, MA",0,18,,4.0,1/12/2018,"Its been a while since I came to this place. I went during lunch time. So it wasn't so busy. We sat at a booth and were treated with courtesy.  The waitress was nice to us. Food was good and never disappoints. I give it a four stars, it takes a long time to go thru their menu. It's too confusing. Lunch should have only lunch proportions and same with dinner and breakfast. They're cheesecakes are wonderful!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington
Jonathan P.,"Hanscom Air Force Base, MA",0,4,,5.0,12/31/2017,"Phenomenal! I have never sent food back but my steak was over cooked, not only did the waitress immediately and respectfully replace my meal she offered me a salad while I waited. Then the manager came over to personally apologize. This, mind you, was all during a lunch rush.  This has always been our go-to for snowy days, but now how could I go to another Cheesecake Factory?!? 5-stars!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington
Alexandra C.,"Boston, MA",560,715,739,2.0,12/27/2017,"Using a Christmas gift card helped. If I had been paying for this meal out of my own pocket, I would have been disappointed.  Firstly, prepare to wait at all times of the day. We were quoted a twenty minute wait at 4 PM and there were plenty of empty tables. The hostesses are rude too. My buzzer went off and she grabbed it and said ""stand over there"" while flailing her arm to the left. Um where? I had to ask someone else because she avoided me after that. We were seated and then forgotten about for over ten minutes. The people next to us got drinks, bread, and made an appetizer order before we even met our waitress. Our bread came out five minutes before our food. Great. Then the waitress we never saw said goodbye and was swapped for another waitress we never saw. I was surprised to see that they have some breakfast all day selections, one of my favorite things in the whole world.  What we got: Farm Fresh Eggs ($7.95)- This was two eggs served with an English muffin and your choice of potatoes or tomatoes. I chose tomatoes. It was good and I didn't feel disgustingly full after I ate it. Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($17.95)- This was parmesan-encrusted chicken served over pasta, peppers, onions, and mushrooms with Spicy New Orleans Sauce. I tried the pasta and it was good, although they gave him five pieces of chicken and a tiny bit of pasta. He's a big guy and he said that was way too much chicken for him; he would have preferred more pasta than the little serving he got rather than wasting all that chicken. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake ($8.95)- Ugh, I was expecting greatness and this missed the mark. This cheesecake was hard and the cookie dough layer in the middle was rock hard. I had my spoon and I was pushing down with all my might to go through the slice and get a bite and I couldn't do it. He had to take a knife and slice it in half so I could even try to get a bite. It was almost as if the slice had been in the freezer and it hadn't be able to thaw long enough. Huge disappointment. And for a piece of cake that was priced higher than my meal. Go figure. Forty dollars and some change for mediocre food and lackluster service. It was a typical chain restaurant experience. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington

Leena P.,"Lowell, MA",3,5,2,1.0,1/8/2018,"BUG IN MY DRINK  After receiving our appetizer, It took a whole 45 minutes until we received our food. By that time, our appetites were gone and the food was not hot. The best part was finding a FRUIT FLY inside my boyfriends strawberry lemonade. After informing the waitress she quickly brought it over to her manager without an apology. The manager, a middle aged Asian women came over to apologize and asked if we would like a cup to go..... I was SHOCKED. She said no more after I declined and never once came back to check up on us. The $3 drink was taken off the bill. Considering the fact that there was a bug with WINGS inside our drink and the only thing done was take It off the bill with a petty apology was beyond me.

The brunch menu and food are sooooo goood! I am still trying a lot of their menu options but it's hard since I sometimes want to get the same thing over and over again. My favorites are buffalo blast (app) (HUGE) Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Chicken Belagio, Thai lettuce wrap and the bacon bacon burger !! Those are some of my faves.

Lauren H.,"Arlington, MA",0,42,4,2.0,10/7/2017,"I just got home from picking up take out from this location tonight and cannot believe I paid $17.95 for the steak medallions! Literally, three, very SMALL pieces of steak were in this meal. Definitely not enough food for a grown, male adult. My fiancé was still hungry after eating it. Initially when I called to place my order, I asked them if they had steak tips and told me this dish was the closet thing to it. So, I went with their recommendation and ordered it. Little did I know, I was going to get ripped off.  Additionally, they previously forgot to package our cheesecakes and I had to wait a week to be sent a gift card for reimbursement.   Becoming very disappointed with the quality and prices of this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington

It was a very busy lunchtime and took a while for our drink orders to come around.  I got the chipotle chicken pasta and was really disappointed with the three small diced pieces of chicken that were in the whole dish. What chicken was there was spicy and well-deserved, but for a 12.95 lunch order, I was disappointed!  Bathrooms were very clean. Decor is the same as the rest of the Cheesecake chain, which I don't really understand, but I guess I don't have to!

Lila S.,"Hubbardston, MA",253,422,277,3.0,5/10/2017,"What hasn't been said about Cheesecake Factory: Slow Slow Slow Service - No matter what location, or what time of day, its either packed and understaffed or dead and grossly understaffed.  The menu is large., .. too large overwhelming and for newbies can be a challenge to pick one thing.  Some items are misleading and mediocre - Example - Cajun Pasta claims to have a rich sauce - its thin, and buttery/oily and not very spicy.  The Shepards pie is... just NOT shepherds pie..  Portions and sides used to be larger and more exciting.?( no more wasabi mashed potatoes )  Quality of the food- Good but has been better The best feature is a small take home, already frozen PLAIN cheesecake with strawberries. They get too melty to take home in slices or fresh. Frozen is just perfect and the smaller one ($50) is more densely loaded with crumb topping. The drinks are good but so lightly prepared its not worth the $12 for a mai tai or long island. ..  It looks beautiful but the decor is so all over the place in theme and texture it can be nauseating (though I do love the wicker chairs outside) and the lighting inside at night is so so so dim I have to use my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. Yes I'll be back I'm just in no rush. Better cheesecakes abound.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington

Megan M.,"Charlestown, Boston, MA",98,3,,2.0,7/19/2017,"The menu is way too extensive and overwhelming, that the wait staff doesn't know how to describe dishes because they are unfamiliar with the products. When I asked for a new knife (it was smudged and sticky), it took them 20 minutes and two requests. These encounters happened throughout my meal.  About a quarter of their items on the menu aren't even in stock. I went to this location about 3 months ago and they didn't have the Tuna Tartare. I went again yesterday and they still didn't restock the item because ""fish prices went up"". If things aren't in stock, take it off your menu!!  The wait is usually about a half an hour, and the waiting area is very disorganized and dysfunctional. How hard is it to invest in some buzzers for patrons to hold while waiting?

J B.,"Nashua, NH",0,8,2,1.0,6/16/2017,"The Good:  Arrived at 4:30 for early dinner and were seated immediately.  The Food:  Three out of four dishes were reported as very good.  The fourth had obviously completed it's cooking process early and ""waited"" for the rest of the order as it had cooled to room temp when served - very disappointing.   The Bad:  Due to our early arrival, the place was very quiet. With that, our food took exceptionally long to reach the table after ordering.  Additionally, upon arrival, I had not entirely settled into my seat and noticed one of my Forks was coated with food debris.  My wife also noticed her knife was filthy dirty. The waitress was quick to replace our utensils with much apology.  Unfortunately this was not the last issue with silverware; with arrival of desert, my wife immediately dropped her spoon realizing it too was caked with leftover, hardened food - we grabbed a pic of it this time. A discussion with the Manager yielded a free piece of cheesecake.  Exiting the restaurant, we all wondered just how clean the rest of the silverware actually was - so far no illness but this drops my review to one-star without hesitation. Conclusion:  I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and they have been great experiences.  Late and cold food, coupled with highly suspect cleanliness makes me seriously question whether I'll revisit this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=20

Yes, the menu is giant. Beaver got the chicken parm sandwich, Ward got the pineapple chicken & shrimp & a glass of wine. Both liked their food. Beav & I stuck to Lemonade, which came with a nice sugar rim on the glass. Danny, our waiter was very nice & brought out good crusty bread. The boys packed up their extra food & each of them got a cheesecake piece for dessert later packed to go. CON-My shrimp scampi was unusual & not in a good way. Came with five decent sized but kinda mushy shrimp displayed on the sides of the giant plate with a scoop of angel hair pasta in the middle. There were whole roasted cloves of garlic scattered around & some (I think) candied pecans(?) in the sauce that gave a weirdly sweet taste to the whole dish. I had to ask for some lemon slices to give it any kind of lemon taste. I ate it, but wouldn't order it again. The place is decorated with that ""Old Italian Church Fresco Ceiling"" look, cheesy for sure. SO-I guess two outta three ain't bad, the boys liked it, but I won't be voting to go back anytime soon.

This was when I opened the menu, I had yet to try the food. Calorie counting and slim waistlines take a backseat to deep fried and over sauced selections from around the globe.  The voluminous menu makes certain there's a selection (usually multiple)  for every taste.  I made the mistake of checking nutritional data prior to my arrival and if i were to indulge I'd have to shame myself in the same manner you criticize someone who smokes while reading the box that's informing them they're killing themselves by using this product.  Remedial calculations for an app, average meal and the obvious need for a cheesecake slice to bookend my experience put my calories around 5500.   I'd assume I'd need the assistance of NASA to determine how many sit-ups I'd need to do to work off the calories in a bistro shrimp pasta.

Very clean, stylish, romantic, A+++ service, very yummy cheese cake!  They bring out bread and butter which is very good.  I had my usual Sam Adams lager which was $8.25 (a little bit more in price than I'm used to paying).  The menu can be a little bit daunting as it is very expansive.  The one thing that I can't put my finger on is that I don't have a favorite meal or every-time I come out of there say wow that was wonderful.  Maybe I haven't found it yet.  My daughter agrees with me too!     I had the Factory Burrito Grande!   It was served with yummy guacamole, sour cream and beans.  The problem with the burrito was WHERE's THE BEEF (or chicken rather).  It was all rice... very very disappointing.   Everyone else enjoy their meal or at least didn't say anything bad about it.   The waiter was excellent... took our orders for the six of us by memory and never got it wrong.

Jakki E.,"Boston, MA",38,20,4,3.0,2/19/2017,"Okay, I know this is a chain, which I never love, but we got a gift card, so we thought we'd give it another try.  First, there was an hour and half wait at 8:00 pm. That's nuts. Not to worry, though, my husband snagged a high top in the bar where we could order food.  We first ordered drinks, which were fair, and apps. Mozzarella sticks were good (can you go wrong w that?), but we had an issue with the artichoke dip. We ordered the artichoke dip and clarified that we did NOT want the spinach dip. What did we get?  The spinach dip. So, we sent it back given that warm spinach activates the hub's gag reflex. The waitress came back and said the artichoke dip was seasonal and wasn't being offered. Okay, but it was still on the menu, so..... No artichoke dip for us. Fine. On to the meal. I got samosas off the skinny menu. I liked them. Hubby got the jambalaya pasta (it was huge, but at $22- at the CCF- it should be). Kids both got Mac n cheese. This was very good- creamy with large pasta. We finished the meal with cheesecake. Can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake. It was delicious.  Ultimately, it wasn't necessarily the food we didn't love, it was the service.  Slow, lacking knowledge, not worth the $130 we paid for dinner.

Wei W.,"Lexington, MA",131,275,1183,3.0,9/6/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is the common denominator when you have a large group of people to entertain with vastly different tastes. As the chain is billed to have the usual American-style food with twists on various cultural dishes, it's broadly got something for everyone. Our latest visit was just after a morning of shopping, so it was righteous to treat ourselves to a decent meal to refuel before the next round. The bf and I arrived just after 2pm, and were seated promptly despite a bustling floor. We were assigned a waitress named Cassandra, and found that the menus we were given were all new. It's been awhile since I've seen clean menus and new items here. So we sat and ordered our rounds of water. We promised Cassandra we would be ready within five minutes to place our order. She returned to our table after 15 minutes; had we not had bread on the table, we probably would have keeled over from low blood sugar. Her lack of enthusiasm for the job really set the tone for the rest of the meal; the expectation bar fell pretty low. I ended up ordering the lunch portion of the chicken piccata, while the bf ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich. Another 20 minutes later, our food arrives. At least Cassandra checked on us within 10 minutes of our eating. The food was good, and as usual, very large in quantity. By the time we were close to done, the bf asked her for the check so we could escape, especially since we had already been seated for over an hour for what we thought would be a brief lunch. Another 10 minutes pass us by. I keep holding onto the hope that speedy service exists here, only to have them repeatedly dashed.

A friend and I came to this location yesterday. We were seated in under 15 minutes even though it was Black Friday and the mall was packed. (Granted there was only two of us and we didn't show up until around 2:30 pm). Overall the service was prompt and friendly. We got some fresh bread to start which was pretty average for free starter bread (though the pumpernickel was definitely the better of the two). The lunch special chicken fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes I ordered was good (not bad or great) though I will say that despite being a lunch portion I could only finish half of it - very heavy! Good thing too since even as a lunch special it was still $12.50. We didn't end up getting any cheesecake this time (except for the free raspberry white chocolate sample which was delicious!) but I've gotten cheesecake here several times and every time it's been delicious!

Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken - delicious, cooked perfectly. Mashed potatoes and green beans were good. The sauce was slightly oily but very tasty.  Carne steak medallions - very good, cooked as asked with a great flavor Mac and Cheese app- 14 and 16 Y/O got this as meal, son was able to finish but not daughter. Both loved it. Pork Chops- very good Drinks - small wine list, got one drink and it was below average Value to Food - We averaged $40 a head with three teenagers and two adults. One wine glass and one drink... two of the kids got only an app and a cheesecake.  The prices are so high that if I had to wait more than half hour I could see the stars start to come down....

Outrageous. There were about 5 or 6 ppl behind the counter but there didn't seem to be a rush. A lot of desserts getting prepped for tables and it seems the take out customers are neglected. This wasn't an oversight either, seemed like standard practice, no apology or a heads up it would take longer and I wasn't the only one that had to wait this long.

Probably 10-15 minutes. As always, I was overwhelmed by their menu, which seems like it's 50 pages and I'm sure most of those items never get ordered.  Our server was very patient with our large group and provided excellent service throughout. I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club with no bacon (chicken, avocado, tomato, swiss, mayo). It was fine. Tasty and a bit messy. Probably not worth the price, but not bad. One of the people in the group was dissatisfied with her Cobb Salad, so I offered her the other half of my sandwich, and she really enjoyed it. The fries were good as well. For dessert, we got the Oreo dream Extreme Cheesecake, which was really disappointing. It's a base layer of fudge cake, then a middle layer of their original cheesecake with Oreos baked in, then a layer of Oreo cookie mousse, topped with milk chocolate icing. I'm an Oreo fan, but nothing about it stood out to me. The cake was pretty cold (must have just come out of the fridge), so it wasn't very moist. The original cheesecake layer wasn't anything special to me, either. The best layer seemed to be the Oreo mousse, but I got sick of that quickly because it was so sweet. Wouldn't order again.

It was served with grilled chicken, pickled cucumbers, julienned carrots, cold noodles, and comes with 3 sauces. Each sauce was very tasty. The chicken scampi was also very good. The pasta was al dente! I hate when my pasta is overcooked. The scampi sauce was garlicky and delicious. It had the perfect balance of acidity and savory mixed together.  The service was absolutely wonderful! The waitress who served our table was a lovely lady. She was very attentive and served us right away, even though she was juggling with several other tables. She made sure our drinks were filled. Because the table for 2 was too small for all of our dishes, she even went to the extent to push the table next to us over, so we had more space.

My friend and I came here for lunch right when they opened so there was no wait. They have a large menu with so many tasty sounding options.  I opted for the macaroni and cheese burger which is basically a huge burger cooked to order, topped with one of their fried mac n cheese balls, sitting under more melted cheese. If you haven't guessed it already, it's one heck of diet bomb but it's so amazing. The mac n cheese ball comes out fresh from the fryer with a nice crunchy crust so when you put the top bun on top and press down, there's an audible cracking sound before the ooey gooey mac n cheese starts oozing out all over the burger.  I ordered a salad on the side instead of fries (though I held no illusions that this was an even remotely healthy meal) and ended up only eating half of my burger. Their portions are almost comically large so it's not always easy to save room for dessert. I managed to save a little bit of room and ordered a slice of the reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake. It was amazing though it was a similarly huge portion size so I took half of it home with me.

I've also been here after work for drinks and apps in the past, and the outdoor seating is pleasant on warmer days.  The drinks are good. Look out for the mango margarita! You will see an array of salads and 'healthy' type apps and entrees on the menu, but if you are like me, you and your dining compadres will order all the things that will make you feel absolutely disgusted with yourself when you leave. For instance, the fried mac and cheese balls drenched in marinara sauce, or the avocado egg rolls... or the sweet corn tamale cakes! Delicious. Sure that Chinese chicken salad may look a little safer, but then you see that egg roll sampler drift by your table, and your mind is back to the fried Mac and cheese balls!

Our server was funny, attentive, and super considerate. Our bread, drinks, and appetizers were awesome and arrived one time. The problem was that one of our entrees, a Chicken Marsala, appeared to have been cooked at some earlier point in the day, sat around for a while, and was reheated before service to us. The pasta was dry, the chicken had the rubbery reheated feel to it, and was just disappointing. My fiancé is rather shy and waited a bit before saying anything, but it was obvious that the pasta was dry and the kitchen should have never put the plate out.

There's not much to say about Cheesecake Factory...This location is at the Burlington Mall so it gets crowded really easy. Can't never get a table on Friday night or weekends most of the time and waiting is usually from 45 minutes to one and a half hours. Place was packed (as usual on Sunday morning)...hostess are not that friendly (they usually looked stressed with 500 people around them looking for tables or complaining about something else) but the food and the service is average ok. Nothing that great but nothing that bad either. Good size portions and they have a giant menu and with hundreds of options.

Brian L.,"Concord, MA",1,46,3,2.0,10/17/2015,"So I've been hearing about the Cheesecake Factory for years and tried one at the International Mall in Tampa ... not bad. Yesterday, I ran into a high school friend at the Burlington Mall and we went to the local Cheesecake Factory for a quick dinner.  One of my worst dinner experience of the past year. I was told the wait was going to be about 50 minutes and the ""beeper"" wouldn't work in the Mall.  Thinking we had at least 30 minutes to roam the mall before we had to be in ""beeper range"", we ran over to the Apple Store for 15 minutes ... not good.  We got back to Cheesecake Factory 20 minutes after we left there and we had ""beeped"" in the meantime. We solved that issue and were seated.  Fenway Park is somewhat quieter, but OK ... we're hungry.  The Server showed up, failed to identify himself and disappeared for 10 minutes.  Not very welcoming or professional, but we're here for the food, not to find quality staff. I ordered the Chick Piccata, one of their ""specialties"", according to their menu.  Fairly simple, right?  Apparently not. The pasta was stone cold.   It wouldn't have been a big deal to send it back, but it took over 10 minutes for our ""server"" to show up and ask ""how's everything"".   When he finally did show up, I sent the Chicken Picatta back.  Within 10 minutes, I was served another dish of Chicken Piccata, by someone I presume to be a ""manager"".   No comment from the manager, she just delivered the meal. It was hot this time, except the Pasta was under-done by a lot ... it wasn't edible. The Chicken Picatta was in a word, disgusting.  The chicken was boiled, not pan cooked.   The sauce was an awful concoction of I'm not sure what.  Traditional Chicken Piccata should have a lemon/butter/caper/mushroom sauce.  This had some weird, white sauce, that tasted and looked like it was made with milk or some such liquid.  I had 3 bites of the chicken and gave up. Starving, I figured I need a dessert to fill me up.  The chocolate tuxedo cheesecake was great, but I wanted to have a cup of coffee to help wash it down.  Coffee is about the most basic beverage to serve and Cheesecake Factory couldn't even deliver the goods when it came to a cup of coffee. The decaf coffee I was served was cold and must have been at least 4 hours old.  My spoon would almost stand up by itself, when I put in the cup.  I asked for ""cream & sugar"" and I was served a small aluminum pitcher of what I suspect, was either milk or some reconstituted coffee lightener.  I took one sip of the coffee and nearly spit it across the table.  I hope after I left, they saved the coffee to use as a solvent to clean their floors, rather than waste it. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake was excellent. In retrospect, the next time I'm hungry at the Burlington Mall, perhaps I'll just go to the Food Court, spent $5 there for some fast food and then go to Cheesecake Factory to get a dessert ""to go"".    I'd save $50 and not have to go home hungry. How this restaurant chain is so successful, baffles me.  I guess it proves that most diners will eat dirt on a shingle and like it, as long as they're served a decent size portion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=80
Kate L.,"Framingham, MA",113,354,37,5.0,10/1/2015,"Never had a bad meal here. LOVE how consistent the food is every time. Despite an issue with my meal at my last visit, management was AMAZINGLY nice and comped our entire meal! Unnecessary but greatly appreciated.  One handy tip: do not be scared by high calories count from dishes w/ dressings and sauces. Simply ask for a side dish and water down the dressing - a little goes a long way and it tastes exactly the same with some water added!

It took over a hour to get our food.  Then when tow people got their pasta dish thepasta was over cooked and gummy. I got orange chicken. The chicken was so over cooked it was like eating plastic.  One person didn't even get her meal. They forgot to cook it. Most sent their food back and it took another hour for the food to come out. The person waiting for their food STILL didn't get hers.  I had to argue with the manager to take my orange chicken off the bill since I sent it back and didn't get a new dish.  We sat there for over 3 hours.  When we all got up our legs were like rubber for sitting so long. I contacted the cheesecake factory via email twice and twice they ignored it.  I will never come back to this place again.

We always love coming here because the food is delicious and the quality is always consistent. We got the avocado rolls as appetizers and as usual, they're yummy and filling. With those on top of the bread basket though, it's really easy to get full so you might want to skip on the appetizer if you want to make room for your entree and dessert. I got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta as my entree, my usual, and only ate half because I wanted to save room for dessert. I took out the other half for leftovers since leftovers from Cheesecake Factory are still good. Since it was an early dinner and since we ate so much, we didn't get dessert which we both ended up regretting! Make room for dessert!  Our waiter was Jack P, if I recall correctly, and his service was pretty standard. We weren't sure if he was a little down because it was so busy or if it was because we ordered water (waiters assume you won't tip generously because you ordered water). We honestly ordered water because we already had a sugary drink right before. Since it was the holiday season and because my best friend is a waiter, we tipped Jack P more than we normally would.

Came here with some coworkers one weekday evening and despite arriving around 7:30pm, there was still a 30 minute wait. Having eaten at a number of different Cheesecake Factory locations, this is pretty typical. This location hands out a beeper that only works in and around the restaurant. Considering this location resides at a mall, they should really move to a system that typically texts you 10 minutes before your table will be ready. That's what the Cheesecake Factory does in my home location, which is also located in a large mall. At any rate, wait time was pretty close to what was quoted. It can be a little noisy in the restaurant making it a little hard to have a  conversation. Our waiter was just OK...not rude but not overly friendly either. On this visit, I went with one of their flatbreads off their Skinnylicious menus, which was good and left room for me to have their lemon meringue cheesecake, which is one of my favorite cheesecakes here.

Joe L.,"Billerica, MA",1,59,,2.0,2/12/2016,"1st time at the Cheesecake Factory and i was not impressed. The restaurant is very loud, between the loud music playing over the speakers, and the  high ceilings which are terrible for acoustics. I'm also not a fan of the tables being side by side so you can reach out and taste your unknown neighbors food, seperate tables or all booths please. Now the food. We started with potstickers and Mac and cheese balls. Cheese balls were very good. I had the steak tacos, the shells for the tacos, terrible, but the steak was tasty. I also tried the monster burrito, not to bad. The cheesecake we had for dessert was ok. Would not attend this establishment again, just was not impressed for the $$ we spent. Oh one thing I do want to mention, our server, Thallia, was fantastic, very attentive, great personality and on top of everything.

Tanya B.,"Boston, MA",1,5,,2.0,11/29/2016,"The food is great here (pretty much the same at all Cheesecake's), but my god - the service. I came here on a Tuesday night for a celebratory dinner for a friend's anniversary. We were told the wait time was an hour - after an hour, that wait time was extended at least another 35 minutes.  Our waiter - I wish I caught his name, but very rude. As we were ordering, he kept on yelling that he could not hear a thing. How can we hear all of our orders, but you can't? Instead of leaning in closer, he made us practically yell out our orders to him. He did this every single time, when ordering both drinks & food. When my brother ordered his meal of Baja Tacos and a side of fries, the waiter said verbatim: ""Are you sure you want the fries as well? The Baja tacos are the biggest item on the menu."" When my sister asked for basil in her Farfalle w/ chicken and roasted garlic pasta, he said, ""Adding basil to the pasta won't make it taste good - some dishes aren't meant for it."" and insisted she should order something else. If someone wants basil, and you can do it, I wouldn't recommend arguing against it. An older lady at the table only ordered sweet potato fries - she received it at the very end after we asked for the check. The fries were taken off the bill, but still unacceptable.

Her tacos were the tempura fried ones.  They weren't that good for a few reasons: 1. No seasoning/salt added 2. Bones still in fish 3. The accouterments were....just there, not particularly good My Chicken BLT was blah! 1. Absolutely no seasoning or salt added.  It was painful, very bleh.

We've attempted to go to the Cheesecake Factory on other occasions, but the lines always stretched to the entrance of the mall.  We were served warm bread and butter as we waited. All four of us got iced tea and lemonade because of the free refills. My boyfriend got 5 refills on his raspberry lemonade. The waiter was very attentive. We ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders as an appetizer and they were so delicious and amazing! I liked it more than my actual meal. I ordered the California Cheese Steak and my boyfriend got the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. He raved about the thick cut, slow roasted bacon on his burger. I tried some and it really just melts in your mouth. None of us had room for dessert afterwards, which was sad 'cause we were at the Cheesecake Factory! When they boxed up our food, we each got a complimentary cup of iced tea or lemonade (depending on what we ordered) to go!  Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the service was fantastic!

Went last night with a friend and we started with the buffalo blasts. If you like buffalo chicken you need these. The Georgia peach and frozen strawberry margarita are so yummy. Reasonably priced at just under $12 each. The blood orange margarita was delicious as well. Strong and beautifully decorated. For entrees I got my favorite pasta da vinci and she got a bbq burger. Their soups are so good too! They change everyday and I always get the clam chowder and baked potato soup when available. We really took our time drinking and eating as we were catching up, and Lauren never made us feel rushed once but knows just when to check in and see how you are :) for dessert we got vanilla bean and the coffee kahula.

Pablo R.,"Belmont, MA",6,27,4,5.0,7/7/2014,"Summary: Delicious food. Must  have time to enjoy. Friendly service. Tad pricey. Tons of options. (If it applies, great gluten-free selection!) Tonight was my first time ever at the Cheese Cake Factory, and I was truly impressed. I've been to the mall many times, and parking is fickle (sometimes you get lucky, most of the time you have to walk a bit). Today  I was lucky and got a place right next to the restaurant. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The menu itself was expansive, and it took me a solid 10 minutes to skim through the whole thing. Deciding on a plate was its own beast, because so many of the options looked fantastic. The waitress was more than friendly, and continually assured us there was no rush. I decided on the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta - nothing but high praise, but we'll get there. The bread they served was great, and I probably ate more than I should  have as a result. The pasta was delicious. A bit spicy, but its clearly labelled as such so I'm not going to doc points for that. The portions are massive, so make sure you're hungry when you come in! I typically eat a lot, and I still had to take half of it home because I couldn't finish it all. In the end I also got a slice of desert, and it completely lives up to the standard its name sets. If you're looking for good food and a nice night out, you can't go wrong here. I should also mention that I went with somebody who has a gluten-sensitivity, and she was blown away with the vast selection they have on their gluten free menu, in contrast to  the sparse pickings which typically plague someone with those limitations. She chose a pasta dish (a chancey move for gluten-free), and had no complaints about her meal either.  The whole dinner for two came out to $50 dollars, which is far more expensive than I usually ever go. But they give you so much that we ended up taking about half of it home - so if you think about it as 2 meals, that  comes out to 25$ for great food, which is a more than reasonable price. Definitely a recommendation for families, friends, and couples.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=140

I won't bore you with the details of TCF, but the one thing I did notice about this place different from the others ones I've been to is that they don't dim the lights very much.

Good but too salty for me. Also huge portions so I'll be eating it for a few days. Boyfriend got Fish and Chips, which was delightfully crispy and not too oily.

This particular place is never to full and less waiting time as opposed to the ones I was used to in Los Angeles especially during the happy hour time. That being said, I don't like their busy hours - the waitress always seem to have a rush attitude as opposed to the waiters, this is my personal view - so I ask for a male server.  My huby's favorite was the ""Fresh Salmon with a Delicious Lemon Sauce, Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes."" He skipped the mashed potatoes and got the Mac and Cheese - they were so cheesy for my own sake, I doubt he will order those again.  Me - Gosh! I really never get to the meal menu since I am always ready to dive in with the dessert.  Price wise: Gosh everything is reasonably price - both my man and me probably ran about $45 of a final bill but then again that was worth every nickel.

Sometimes the wait staff are busy and it is hard to grab their attention, but as stated, the food and drinks are worth the wait. If you are impatient and looking for a quick meal, do not try this location at peak dinner/ lunch hours. I usually find there is no wait on weekday evenings.  My favorite cheesecake is the godiva chocolate or hershey chocolate. Try the sliders, buffalo blasts and surprisingly, their pasta dishes are amazing.  Portions can be large for dinner, perfect at lunch time.  The only reason this location is not getting a 5/5 is because I had an issue with my food at this specific location a few months ago.

For appetizer, you must try the hot spinach and cheese dip, mmm! My friend and I ordered the 'Louisiana chicken pasta' which was deeeeelicious! My other friend ordered the Shepherd's pie, which was also good, but something I wouldn't order (I'm not a big fan of carrots in anything and the dish had shredded carrots in it. . . ) My other friend ordered the Caramel chicken, which is also good, but I don't think I would personally order it. We were way too stuffed to even go for dessert! I'm not crazy about cheesecake, but I sure didn't hesitate to take a bite when my brother use to buy them and bring it home. One of my friends went to the counter and ordered two slices to go which came out to be ~$15.  We came on a saturday night, so a wait was expected. We got there at 8pm, got seated by 9pm and served our dinner at 10pm. Btw, make sure you are near/ in the cheesecake factory close to your estimated wait time, the clicker isn't activated otherwise.

I can always find something no matter what I'm craving.  Reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is:  1. The prices are a bit steep but the portions are huge, so its like you are paying for 2 meals since I always have left overs.  2. There is always a rediculous wait (1 hr +) and they dont take reservations.  3. Every location I have been to has NO parking. Even the ones at the malls are difficult to park at.  I have tried too many items to list but some of my favorite are BUFFALO BLASTS and THAI LETTUCE WRAPS.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the THAI LETTUCE WRAPS. :)  The drinks are also EXCELLENT. I have tried several of their alcoholic drinks and have enjoyed everyone of them. My favorite is the Mojito. Cheesecake Factory makes the best Mojito I have ever had.

Of course the vanilla bean cheesecake dessert was great too. The not-so good-news: Please! Don't call a couple (male and female) in ther fifties ""guys"". This is not appropriate.

The burger itself was tasty if HEAVILY salted. The best thing on my plate were my sweet potato fries. Perfectly cooked.  My partner got a BLT salad, which was interestingly presented- a head of lettuce was cut into giant slices, laid out on the plate and toppings added.

Callie H.,"Nashua, NH",26,14,7,3.0,10/16/2015,"Planned a trip to the Burlington Mall and Cheesecake Factory with a friend a while ago. We were so excited to eat here since this was the place to be when in the Burlington Mall. The Cheesecakes are just amazing. The food was great...but the service was just absolutely dreadful. We received a buzzer that would go off in 20 minutes. When the buzzer did go off a little after 20 minutes we notified the hostess. Once we told them anther hostess said ok it will be just one moment and she went to a nearby table asking another couple to leave their table so we could eat there. I find this very rude to ask to leave your table especially if you have a lot of food left on your plate. The servers moved them and their food to another table. To who ever was at this table I am so sorry about that and I would have let you stayed and waited until the next table was done. Once we were seated there was no silverware so that came straight after. I did notice the silverware not very clean. Looked like they might have been taken out of washer and not dried with a cloth right away. We were given waters and bread, which was nice. When we were ready to order food my friend asked for a special request. She wanted the lettuce wraps but instead wanted the chicken greek salad in the wraps. ""May I please have the greek instead without the cucumber in the wraps?"" He asked why she didn't want cucmbers, and she doe not like them""Is this possible"" she asked. The waiter said ""no."" My friend asked, ""then what can you do?"" Thinking that he would be accommodating to a paying customer and making her happy he would have suggested something or given her what she wanted. But instead he said, ""Nothing."" I looked up at my friend and the two tables next to us could here what he said and both looked at us thinking, ""What did he just say?"" ""You will only be getting a little olive, arugula, and cheese if you get the chicken greek salad,"" he said. ""It is tiny and it will not be enough food."" They were going back and forth about the greek salad. If he did allow her to have what she wanted it would have costed more anyways. No waiter ever says ""No I cannot do anything for you. "" She could not get what she wanted and made my friend feel very uncomfortable and embarrassed. So she stuck with the regular lettuce wraps. The two tables next to us started talking to us like this is crazy. When he brought it out he said ""Look now doesn't that look better? The other dish would have been very little."" Kaazur, I believe that is how you spell it does not know how much she is able to eat and should not have said that. We could not believe the service we were experiencing. I ordered the grilled chicken avocado club, which was terrific which I would order again and make myself at home. She did not finish hers. When she saw the waiter again she pointed take-out box please. He looked at her and gave a hand gesture to the side of his legs that was stating, ""You couldn't finish that, it was so small.?"" UNBELIEVABLE. Yup... no tip and spoke to the Mike the manager which didn't help at all. All he said was, ""Im sorry."" Nothing about he would talk to his staff member. Just, Oh sorry, oh so very sorry."" Will be back again but no with that waiter again. This is really not his profession. I have been here in the past with a positive experience but this by far is the WORST service I have ever had when dining out, not just including this particular restaurant.

Mike W.,"Belmont, MA",386,165,492,4.0,5/1/2012,"It might be a bit on the pricey side here, but I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal at a Cheesecake Factory location. One of the things I like about this place is the various options of atmosphere that they give.  They have a decent size bar with four TVs and high top seating for small groups.  A bunch of 5-6 person booths and 2-4 person tables in a open area.  Also if you want a more intimate setting some tables and booths have high backs that give you and your dinner dates a little more privacy.  If you're looking for a quiet dining experience I would suggest asking for one of the secluded tables.  Since the open area, I mentioned above, usually has a good number of families dining there and depending on the day and time those families can have loud kids. On my most recent visit I started with an order of Buffalo Blasts.  They're fried, spicy pouches stuffed with chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce.  They come served with celery sticks and blue cheese, and on the recommendation of our server we also had a side of ranch dressing for a slight change of flavor.  They're not quite as filling as normal boneless buffalo wings, but as a light starter they're not too bad. For dinner I went to the ""Glamburgers"" section of their rather lager menu, and selected the Memphis Burger.  In the words of Jules Whitfield as he bit into a Big Kahuna Burger, ""Mmmmmm this is a tasty burger!""  The burger itself is a thick, juicy and very flavorful patty which gets topped with slow roasted BBQ pulled pork, melted cheddar cheese, cole slaw, pickles and mayo.  It is quite the mouthful, and if you don't have big hands you'll probably end up cutting it in half just to make the handling of the burger a bit easier.  The Memphis Burger not only fills you up, it's an absolutely delicious meal. My girlfriend is a little less adventurous when we come here.  While I usually like to try something new each time I visit, she knows exactly what she's going to get without question.  The Thai Lettuce Wraps, which are actually an appetizer.  My assumption is they expect you to share it with the table, but if one person orders it they should be plenty satisfied with it as a meal. If there is a negative for me to point out, I guess it would be that the drinks could have been a tad bit stronger.  In other words, not much to complain about here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=160

I haven't eaten at Cheesecake Factory since a company Christmas party in 2003.   Last Monday, after shopping in Nashua, New Hampshire all day, The Boyfriend and I stopped here for an early dinner.  We started the Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip which I thought was good but not really my cup of tea.  The Boyfriend is a seafood-aholic so whenever we go out, he orders seafood and as much of it as he can eat. I thought the toast points that came with it where too buttery/greasy for the dip and their white bread in the bread basket was a better compliment to the dip. The Boyfriend had the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo with Brown Rice.  He loved it and ate every drop of it.  I tasted it and it was really good, complex and spicy. I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad.  I know it might seem strange but I almost always order a meal size salad here or the Thai Chicken Pasta.  They make the best giant salads filled with tons of great ingredients and chopped lettuces.  I loved this one. It was filled with tons of chicken, great tasting black beans, wonderful corn, fresh avocado and fresh tomatoes. And I can never even finish half of their salads so I get a yummy lunch the next day (I actually love the wilted lettuce the next day). The Boyfriend is not a big cheesecake fan and I was stuffed so we got a piece of Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake to go.  It was perfect, heavenly and decadent. But I admit to being horrified that they charge $6.95 for a piece of cheesecake now! I could and can bake an entire cheesecake for probably the same cost!  Anyway, it was good to eat here again and I'm sure The Boyfriend and I will venture here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=200

Michela M.,"Malden, MA",2,13,,2.0,7/17/2014,"Dined on 7/15/2014. I am a waitress myself so I am always cautious of myself and my family members to be ""Polite"" and not do things to other servers that would be irritating to myself :) . so when I tell you  this experience was ridiculous I mean it was RIDICULOUS. WE sat down in the lounge (did not ask for it, but was fine with it) I  was joined by my mother and my grandmother. We usually come every 2 weeks to catch up and have lunch. Waitress came over introduced hereself, took our drink order, brought bread fine. no complaints. She came back asked if we wanted an appitizer (I was at a Cheesecake Factory in Florida about a month ago and they did a 4-6 happy hour, so I asked) Do you guys do happy hour here? and her response was ""I dont know what time is it?"" I looked at her, and said ""I don't know the exact time?"" (WAS THAT THE QUESTION? my grandmother said 4:12, she said ""then I guess we do, but if you were sitting in the dining room we would not give it to you, only in the lounge."" OK GREAT THANKS? .. I said ""well since we are sitting in the lounge, do you think we could do it?"" She said ""Yup I'll get you the menu, did you know about our little secret?"" I said ""what secret?"" ""she said happy hour?"" I said ""Well apparently not since I just asked you about it"" she brought the menu told us she would give us a few minutes.  She came back, I was thinking of ordering the Tuna tempura rolls. She asked if we had any questions, I said yes, ""What is Nori?"" She said ""I don't know...."" I said ""Oh, Okay"" She said ""Why is it on the Menu? I have  worked her for 9 years and have never heard of it."" My grandmother said - it is the seaweed the Sushi is rolled in. Well the waitress HAD to make it known again, she's worked here 9 years and has never been asked and she knows EVERYTHING. OK great it's fine you didn't know it, it's a big menu relax. We order, buffalo blasts (amazing) Tuna tempura, 2 small salads, and said everything would be fine to come out together. 5 minutes later the two salads came up, she put them down and said ""well they were ready, is it okay if I put them down?"" - were we supposed to say no?. She puts them down, I did not get a salad so I had nothing, does not really bother me. couple minutes later, The Tuna roll comes up. Presentation was beautiful. Again she mentions the Nori and shows me where it is in the  roll, yup thank I get it. I should have read the menu, i know Tempura means fried, but I was expecting the Sushi to be a little more on the raw side then fully cooked and did not like it (Not anyone's fault, just was not for me!) She came over and i told her not to worry It just  wasn't for me, she says ""Oh yeah, you just must not know a lot about Sushi."" ........ NOPE, I do thanks, i just did not expect it to be cooked and do not like it. 15 minutes into the meal still no buffalo blasts, and we were not in a rush at all so we did not notice. The manager came over which was VERY nice apologized and said they would be right out and acknowledged they were taking a long time. 5 minutes later a food runner brings them out. we start eating them (mainly myself since I did not end up having a meal), waitress comes over tops 3 minutes later with the dessert menu and immedietly starts talking about cheesecake, and is staring at us. ""Is anyone interested?"" .. well probably not, since the last of our meal JUST came out. She says ""I'll leave the menu for you."" we continue eating, she comes back about 10 minutes later, which was fine, but asks us again- can we digest or? My grandmother gives her the food and says you can just wrap it. Wraps it brings it back, asks if we want Coffee, we order 2 cups. My mom was outside, we said she might want something shell be back in a few minutes. 5 minutes later she comes back with anothe waitress to let us know it's shift change and she will be taking over from there. IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, she asks the other waitress if she knows what Nori is, the waitress did. ARE YOU KDIDING ME, let it go lady we could have cared less if you know what it is, get over it. Was pretty obvious why she wanted to rush the cheesecake because it was time to go home. and noting to your customers that it is ""shift change"" is the tackiest of tacky. I love the cheesecake factory and have had too many good experiences to say I would not go back, but it baffles me how some people maintain a job for several years with this odd, rude, behavior.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=200
Alex G.,"Stamford, CT",2,8,,4.0,11/10/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is pretty typical of Cheesecake Factory's in terms of layout - it's a nice-looking layout, though a bit dark inside.  I used to come here on a weekly basis, because I would stop by after a mall trip. Though convenient to mall-goers, this can be a huge downfall to those who wish to just go out to dinner, because this particular location gets so crowded! They DO NOT take call ahead seating, which means that you just have to go there and wait... Additionally, by being attached to the mall, it attracts more young kids, crying babies in strollers, and other stragglers, if you will (I figured I'd mention, since some people care about this!) Their waitstaff is usually pretty good - obviously some are better than others, and the place is usually crazy busy, so you can't always expect the best. Generally attentive and friendly. When we were going there frequently, we had a set of waiters that we would request - they were exceptional! Now on to the food... I've had a number of dishes here (all great - huge - portion sizes and I generally do not order appetizers). Here are some of my favorites: 1) Crispy spicy beef: a yummy dish, medium spice level, and yes, it is crunchy, not soggy. I enjoy this entree, a lot. 2) Renee's special: though you have a couple choices for this one, I usually get the soup of the day, a Caesar salad - great dressing but VERY garlicky, so be careful if you're on a first date/care about your breath post meal, and a chicken salad sandwich. For the price, this meal is a great value and great for your taste buds, and definitely does not leave you hungry.  3) Another favorite of mine is (I forget the name) one of the pastas. It has farfalle (bow tie) pasta, sun dried tomatoes, chicken, peas, mushrooms... And it is amazing. When in doubt of what to order at this place, get a pasta!! Though this pasta is my go-to, I've had others and they're always very flavorful and chock-full of ingredients. Their pasta is not homemade, or at least it doesn't seem it, but this is the only downfall here. Again, portions are huge.  For dessert, I've only had cheesecake - it's good stuff, very rich. They offer a huge selection of flavors, so happy choosing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=200

My sister, who was conveniently seated to my right, ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes.  The plate didn't have the most beautiful presentation (three pancakes stacked high with some mushy strawberries and powdered sugar).  But, those pancakes, ohhhh those pancakes, were AMAZING.  Every time she turned her head, I grabbed a bite of those most delicious pancakes.  I am determined to find the recipe for these things.  Service was OK.  We thought our server abandoned us after he went missing for 15 minutes.  He had actually spilled our drinks, oh well, shit happens.

Lisa M.,"Arlington, MA",34,95,10,5.0,7/31/2010,"All right, people, I don't doubt that the wait at a regular mealtime is frustrating... however, there's a reason for that:  The food really is quite good.  Let me preface this by saying that if I still lived in the Central West End of St. Louis, I probably would have given 4 stars.  But the description of 5 stars (""as good as it gets"") is right on now that we live in Arlington, MA (sorry people, but this is a really white 'burb with hit-or-miss restaurants).  Their menu is gigantic - as in, over 200 menu items - and so there *are* things on it that are less than fabulous.  Usually though, those things are still good.  Here are a few of the greats: - Chicken Enchiladas.  This is a new item on the ""special menu.""  I just had it last night.  As someone who orders enchiladas pretty much everywhere, these were awesome.  And they were better than what I had at Zocalo (although admittedly Zocalo gave me beef and I had ordered chicken - and Zocalo's were still good).  They had a very nice tang, plenty of sauce and cheese, and the black beans and cilantro rice were perfect compliments.  I highly recommend and hope this will be a standard menu item in the future. - The endive salad with glazed pecans and blue cheese (under ""small plates"").  It sounds plain ... but it's awesome.  Try it.  You'll want to move to France or Belgium (for endives).  I've watched friends order and love their other salads as well (thai noodle, French country, factory chopped etc.). - The chicken madeira (their ""most popular chicken dish"") is excellent.  And yields plenty of leftovers. - The four cheese pasta is exactly what you want to order when you want a little marinara to break up a lot of awesome cheese. - The cheesecake.  Even the negative reviewers below don't attempt to deny that it's phenomenal.  Often I'll just order a plain, traditional slice, because I'm in the mood for pure, unadulterated cheesy sweet goodness.  If you're looking for greater adventure: - The new Reeses Peanut Butter and Chocolate is TO DIE FOR.  I thought in ordering it that it might be too much - too sweet, too much.  Uh, no.  This was perfection in my mouth.  I couldn't eat it all in one setting, but that wasn't because it was ""too"" anything other than maybe too big a slice.  If there are chocolate-peanut butter lovers out there who aren't trying this, that constitutes tragedy in my book. - If you're in a chocolate mood, the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake (which is part flourless Godiva chocolate cake, part chocolate mousse, part chocolate cheesecake) is heavenly. - I've heard that the Red Velvet Cheesecake is to die for, and it's next on my list to try. - The fresh banana cheesecake has been decent in the past. - I would try one of the above before straying, because although they're all awesome, the above are phenomenal.

They have a HUGE menu that is sure to have something you are in the mood for. Their Sunday brunches are good as well. Funny thing is, I rarely get their cheesecake, even though it is really good and they have tons of flavors. The other thing I don't like about the atmosphere (aside from the long waits) is that they stuff you into little tables that are right on top of each other.

Marcy K.,"Chelmsford, MA",59,342,1,4.0,9/12/2009,"After doing some errands in the area, we put our name on the list at the Cheesecake Factory and then headed to the LL Bean store about 3 miles away. Got back in an hour, just in time to feel that pager shake. Great timing.  The place was hopping, and it wasn't really that late. This location is huge, and since they know the wait is usually long, management has designed benches into the decor, and there are also comfy seats right near Macy's entrance. I've never had a drink here, but there's a nice bar near the front, and of course, a huge take-out area packed with every type of cheesecake imaginable as well as bottles of the place's salad dressings and BBQ sauce for purchase. When we sat down, the waitress brought us fresh, warm, and yummy whole wheat bread. Our server was very pleasant and helpful and recommended the beef ribs, which turned out to be an excellent choice. I was hesitant about ordering pricey ribs here, but Mr. K said they were better than almost any others he has had (he only ate 1/2 his order and will finish the rest tomorrow). The sides were French fries and onion rings, both as crisp as my husband likes them to be. I ordered an omelette with cheese, avocado, peppers, and mushroom, with a side of so-so home fries; I took home 3/4 of my entree, but am not sure it will be good tomorrow.  You can't come to this place without ordering a slice of the establishment's namesake, so we brought home a slice of chocolate coconut cream cheesecake for later. Much later. I took a peek and then took a micro-forkful, and am happy to say we made a good choice: The bottom layer tastes like a Mounds candy bar. Wow!   I'm surprising myself with the number of stars I'm awarding, but I have to go with four: Nothing really bad. Wasn't even noisy, and no one was bumping into me. Edited 9/13: The omelette was just as good today as it was yesterday...and I STILL didn't finish it.

There is no need to have over 100 food options to choose from especially when they're all mediocre dishes.  I went on a Wednesday night and waited 45 minutes only to be seated next to a bat shit crazy woman who was slamming martinis, while gracefully hammering her cowering and completely frightened partner with obscenities that wouldn't cross the lips of a homeless crackhead with tourettes syndrome. Thankfully, after the third martini she decided to bail on the bill, only to leave her punching bag completely pounded, deflated and about $70 in the hole. I've never seen such a display at a restaurant and honestly don't understand how management didn't remove her from the premises. So yeah, the seating is awful, it's like you're having a big family dinner with every looney tune that escaped the nut house.  Good thing I looked at the menu online or I would have never been able to order. I got the grilled wasabi crusted, Ahi tuna served on a bed of white rice with a veggie medley. The food was A-Ok, the Tuna was cooked really well and the rice and veggies were tasty (maybe a little too much butter on the rice). Needless to say, I got cheesecake to go.

Mitch F.,"East Bridgewater, MA",23,51,1,4.0,6/2/2010,"I want to give it 3 stars. SOO badly.  Let me give the bad before the good.  It's very loud, there were a ton of people there. It was actually very difficult for me to understand the waiter. I've got a slight hearing impairment, so it was very difficult to hear and everything wasn't clear. Good thing that I can read lips to a moderate extent. It was also very crowded, physically crowded. I was pretty close to the person next to me in the chairs that we were sitting in. It would have been better with a booth, especially because one opened up the second that we were seated. The wait wasn't terrible, maybe 5 minutes - but this was on a Tuesday night. Expect high waits on the weekends, I would recommend calling alead for a reservation. I'm not even sure they take reservations.  Now the good, or great. The food was really good, almost excellent.  The only thing that I got was the charbroiled steak, done medium.  The outside of the steak was just that, charbroiled - just the way that I like it. It wasn't seared to a crisp, the outside flavor of the steak was a perfect compliment to the inner meat. In addition, they put perhaps an herb butter on top of the a small section of the steak, which I thought would ruin it. In fact, it enhanced the flavor further and I only wished that the entire steak was covered in it. They left the fat in the plate, and must have done something - perhaps blended it with spices, because when I tried dipping a piece of steak into it, the flavor was excellent. I throughly enjoyed the steak, one of the bests that I've ever had.  It also came with french fries and onion rings (2 of them). The onion rings were nothing special and didn't particularly have much flavor. The french fries were excellent, perfectly seasoned with salt. They remind me of the ""diesel fries"" at Worcester D.C. at UMass Amherst, which are - surprisingly - some of the best french fries I've ever had. Top notch. Location is great, right off of 128 in Burlington at the Burlington Mall.  For that matter, even though it was very difficult to understand the waiter, he was a very competent waiter. He knew a ton about the menu and gave some terrific suggestions.  My friends all said that their meals were excellent and got: a BBQ chicken pizza, club sandwich and a garlic chicken pasta dinner. The portions were humungous, the club sandwich was outrageous - perhaps a foot long.  The BBQ chicken pizza was a little more reasonable in size, as was my steak.  This was my first time here, so maybe it was just a good experience. When I go back, I'll post an update. The prices were ok, my steak was $20 - but a generous portion of the steak as well as a nice helping of fries made the meal much more worth it.  The sodas were about $3, but that was for 3 of them - so I guess that's ok.  I didn't get any cheesecake, but how can you with such big portions?

I know - you don't think of the Cheesecake Factory as a breakfast joint but surprise, surprise, they actually serve breakfast all day, every day.  Since Sunday had a significant snow, there were no lines-no waiting at noon. After being seated quickly, it was right to checking out the menu for breakfast stuff. They had a limited assortment of breakfast food but the fact that they serve it all day is a plus in my book. If you like pancakes, you'll be out of luck. I ordered the french toast (which you can get plain or with strawberries) plain with 2 eggs over hard and very crispy bacon. Everything was cooked perfectly. The french toast (3 slices, halved) were heavenly - fluffy, almost fried dough-eske - cooked golden brown. After the eggs and bacon, I could only finish 3 half slices of the toast - almost a crime to not devour them all on the spot but they made a great dessert late the same night in the microwave with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and maple syrup. Overall, service was friendly and quick. The food was great and the atmosphere was good.

Because it's attached to the Burlington Mall, it's even more busy than some locations, and parking is terrible on weekends and holiday season. To make up for the busyness of it, this location is REALLY BIG. Still, typical wait time during meal hours here is 30 to 90 minutes, though our party of 12 got seated in 15-20 on Sunday night. If you're shopping at the mall, put your name on the list, then go out and do your shopping. They do have take out parking spots where they can bring the food out to you, but even those can get filled up at times! Best stuff here is on the appetizer menu: Thai lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls. Luau salad is always great, and you can't really go too wrong with their big and eclectic menu.

Mark T.,"Chandler, AZ",409,574,963,2.0,5/30/2011,"The food was fine; fairly standard experience there. The aspect of this visit that stood out the most was the incredibly slow service.  A friend in my party ordered Coke Zero and upon refill noticed it was Root Beer.  The waiter eventually showed up again and she told him it was the incorrect drink. She said she would keep it because she was thirsty (due to his slow response time). He acknowledged the error and said it was the second time he did that today. Other tables seemed to move more quickly. My friend and I said we were splitting a cheesecake. In most circles that means one cheese cake and two forks.  He brought us two plates each with a sliver of cheesecake. It would seem that it was one piece sliced in half, but in comparison to a third friend who ordered a piece unto herself, our halves seemed smaller. What if we wanted to do it Lady & the Tramp style? And he didn't bring new utensils with the cheesecake.  I also didn't like the way he snatched the menu from in front of me, showed it to the table beside me, then he put it back in front of me when we were deciding on cheesecake.  Other little things were annoying such as taking picking up the bill from in front of me and beside the friend on my right (who had a separate check) and when he returned he put them both on the opposite side of the table. Didn't your mama teach you to put things back where you found them? The waiter focused on other tables more than ours. The one next to us turned over twice. As busy as the restaurant was and as many people we waiting I would think he would move a little quicker. All in all it was a lackluster experience at an overpriced establishment.

The first thing I always hear people say about this place is ""it's so expensive"". It really is not.  You pick whether you get an expensive meal or not, it's not like you order and then get some ridiculously high bill.... the menu says the prices right on it.

Their portions are large, and for me, who is a big big eater who wants a lot of food, this eliminates needing an appetizer, especially with the bread they give you.

Thirty minutes pass by, and we walk back.  Much to our delight the buzzer goes off.  We are thinking, 'excellent, a bit earlier than expected!'  Not so lucky.  We walk in, hand them the buzzer, and they tell us to stand over there, someone would seat us shortly.  What is that?  Don't beep me early if you aren't seating me right then and there.  Sorry but we have a 2 year old that has the attention span of a puppy.  So not cool. We wait another 15 minutes and are finally seated.  Our waitress (I forget her name) took our drink orders, and disappeared.  She came back about 20 minutes later with 2 cokes, and a milk.  It wasn't liquor, what took so long?!  I ask for a kid's menu, they don't have one.  So she starts to ramble on about what they offer for children.  I order the baby girl chicken fingers, and fries.  The man orders the soup de jour.   Another 20 minutes pass by, bread is brought out, along with the soup, and the baby girls meal.  Mind you at this time a woman and child is seated next to us (this will come up later).  She then takes our meal orders.  We both decided on dishes off of the Specials Menu.  And she leaves. Well we wait, and we wait, and we wait some more for our food.  It finally finds its way to our table.  At which point baby girl is in complete melt down mode.  She is tired, and cranky.  All she wants is a nap.  She never asks for a nap.  At this point we notice the people next to us (the woman and child) receive their meals!!!!  WTFFF????!!!!  We are both irritated at this point.  We waited almost an hour for our meals and they get theirs in 15 minutes.  Do you see something wrong with that?  I do. Needless to say our anniversary lunch was cut very short by the cranky 2 year old.  So we had our meals boxed up and we left.  I did have mine for dinner tonight while at work.  It was delicious (even when reheated).  It was spaghetti in a creamy pesto sauce with Parmesan encrusted chicken, prosciutto, and mixed greens.  Very yummy!

Whenever I go, and wherever I go to (Burlington Mall, the Pru, Chestnut Hill) there is always a ridiculously long wait.  And for what?? The food at all three of these locations has been ehhh, but nothing special. This is if you can finally decide on what to order. I think the menu is about 15 pages long, including advertisements. Have they ever heard of there being TOO many options? I'm a pretty decisive person, but get that Cheesecake Factory menu in front of me and I'm lost among all of the choices. From meatloaf to fish tacos, tri-colored pasta with spicy Thai peanut sauce to pizza, they have something for everyone, but sometimes that's not a good thing.... The decor is always beautiful, gorgeous light fixtures, high ceilings, lots of plants, I can't complain there. But the backbone of any restaurant is the food, and the Cheesecake Factory just doesn't deliver. I think their motto is ""quantity, not quality.""  And the cheesecake, it's fine.

Sometimes so-called 'healthy' portions are nothing of the kind, and for me, they just make me resent the whole experience.  Heck, even the appetizers are more than what I'd consider to be a full meal for two or three people.  It's just obscene.

And seriously the ads are just annoying.  But I suppose the good thing is - when you have a menu this obscenely large there's something for everyone - even if it is rather average. And when you work in the area and you friend meets you for lunch with a baby - there aren't a whole lot of choices that don't suck.  Why people wait 2 hours to come here I will never know. I mean the food is fine, but it's not amazing. Now the cheesecake on the other hand I do really love, because really how can you not love cheesecake and there's like 25 different kinds and really they are all pretty tasty. Sure you are eating your monthly caloric intake in one meal, but how often does one come here and eat cheesecake? For me it's like 2-4 times a year. What is great about this place - almost any time I've been here the wait staff is super friendly - today was no exception.

Rob C.,"Boston, MA",66,443,2,3.0,6/30/2007,"For a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory is decidedly odd.  Before having ever gone to one, a while ago, I kinda expected to see something that looked, well, more like a factory.  Maybe with a machine like the Krispy Kreme donut machine that made cheesecake instead.  However, I'd probably have been the only one who thought that would be cool.  I was definitely surprised by it, though.  These places look like their designer went to Vegas and decided to pick through the surplus of Caesar's, the Bellagio, and the Venetian.  Huge columns, marble, impressive lighting, and more textured-looking paint than you can shake a stick at.  It's all very nice looking, but at the same time, the artifice of it is very noticeable.   The other weird thing is their menus.  I've never seen anywhere else that has advertisements in their menus.  It's not as if it's a greasy diner with local businesses on a placemat.  surely i'd be willing to pay another quarter to not have to deal with that.  It's not a cheap place, by any means.  It's just strange that they felt that was necessary. That said, the food is usually very decent.  Decent to really good, even.  I had a really good, huge bacon cheeseburger last night.  The only downside was that they put mayonnaise on it.  I never understood why, on a sandwich that is specified to include one condiment, say, barbecue, another is added, left unmentioned.  bah.  i'm ordinarily not a fussy person, but i despise mayo.  it scraped off, though.  their menu is vast and strange, there's everything from comfort food to asian stuff, and that's kind of a broad spectrum. they also tend to have really good coke.  some restaurants have much better soda than others, and this is one of them; bonus points for prompt refills, too.   as for cheesecake, well, i don't even eat it usually.  but i hear it's all right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-burlington?start=280

Well, one lovely, sweet, creamy, chocolate-y (or whatever flavor you choose) piece of cheesecake rings in at about 65 points. Now, I'm not a math genius, and I very rarely am able to figure out shit logically, but that tells me that I wouldn't be able to eat for three days after one slice of cheesecake.

The wait time was colossal (75-90 minutes on a Sat. at 5pm sharp) and I really wanted to hate the place, but....I ordered the Garlic Noodles w/ Chicken and the chicken was cooked perfectly.   Not dry and stringy.  Not too undercooked, raw or greasy.  Not prefrozen, but fresh. The spaghettini was perfectly done, not too hard, not mushy. The portion was good, although I'm being greedy when I wish I had an extra piece of chicken.   It was 17 bucks, but they could have charged a buck or two more for the quality....might also discourage some of the troglodytes and mallrats if they jacked up the price a little. The only thing that hurts this place are the patrons.   I'm not above everyone that eats there, but when the wait times creep up to 3 hours and you have people fighting over a bench in the waiting area because they've been standing for so long, it takes away from the pleasantness of dining out, and the ambiance of a 'nice' night out at a 'fancy' restaurant. Update - I'll never go here again.  ""It takes years to gain a customer, seconds to lose one.""  The hostess actually made an effort to upset our party.  We went on an off-peak time for dinner, and asked if we needed one of the beepers.  The response from the Hostess was that the wait will be less than 5 minutes and to just wait to the side and she'll get us a table almost immediately.  From there, things quickly went south; I would have been ok with a 5, 10, 15, even a 20 minute wait, but, after nearly 30 minutes later, and party after party after party getting seated ahead of us, I decided to speak up.  I wasn't impolite, but received a reaction like I had just insulted a dignitary.  She told us that ""those people were waiting outside and were here before [us].""  Liar liar pants on fire!  Would it have been that hard to admit that you forgot us by mistake? That's not the end of it, though.  As if to punish me for having the audacity to question her, she then proceeded to let in several other parties that came in (like most of the others that were let in ahead of us that came in after us) from the parking lot. After close to 10 more minutes, another member of my party spoke up, and was given the same line and this time they were challenged.  I intervened, told them to forget about it, that we were leaving.

It might be because I am a complete suburbanite and/or I go out with workmates often enough to realize how difficult it is to decide on a lunch locale everyone can enjoy. Last time I went, my husband had the marsala-like chicken with its 3 heaping piles of mashed potatoes and some asparagus while I dined on my soup du jour, salad and half sandwich that could have fed a village in Vietnam for the day. Surprisingly we finished our plates. Not quite sure if that was a good or bad thing. Let's say most people leave with a doggie bag. We were little piglets that evening.

Riem K.,"Melrose, MA",10,72,6,3.0,11/17/2007,"3 Stars and no more. It's a chain restaurant, so you kinda expect food that is a little above average and you just go there for convenience. It's like Dunkin Donuts, you know you can make it at home, but you rather just go to the chain for the sake of laziness. Usually, it's not bad, not spectacular, but not horrid either. plus the fact that you will have leftovers for days to come doesn't hurt either. However today's visit was below average. I was craving late last night one of their cheesecakes, so we decided to lunch there. First, it's just 12pm in a mall. The mall is PACKED and it's not even after Thanksgiving yet, and there's a 45 minute wait at the Factory. When we are seated, it's in the two seats that are right behind the wall where people would wait to get their names called. Not only did I have to deal with people constantly looking down at me to see what I was reading on the menu, what every single item was on my table and what I had ordered for drinks, appetizers and entree. But I had a nice lady (sarcastically) flipping her hair with my food right underneath her. So after conveniently banging on the wall, she stopped. Appetizers came, and it a greasy mess of calamari. Never has it been that greasy. I asked the waitress for a straw, she came back with my unwrapped straw in hand. Not to be paranoid, but I know those suckers come wrap, keep em wrap till you get to my table. Entrees came and I had ordered the combo steak diane and shrimp scampi. Scampi was drowned in lemon butter and the steak was drowned in some oversalted sauce. We asked for the check and took our cheesecake home. Usually, my experience is not this bad, so I gave it a three star instead of one.

No, we dont have those."" Like she was a 3 year old. And then I suggested that mom look at the drink menu. I am sorry, there is just no reason to be that condescending to someone. Thankfully, after someone else had delivered our drinks, we had a new waitress come over. Apparently, mean girl had been cut. Our new server  was VERY nice. I knew that I needed a take-out at the beginning of my meal and was afraid to ask for the lunch portion from the original waitress, but gave it a shot with the new one.
