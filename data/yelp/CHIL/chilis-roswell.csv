Katherine M.,"Madison, WI",0,55,2,4.0,8/28/2017,"Based on what other reviewers said about this establishment, my expectations were low. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very similar visit to other Chili's and the service was pretty good. The kitchen was very fast and food was consistent to other Chili's. Would return if I'm ever in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Christi J.,"Clovis, NM",6,17,9,1.0,12/11/2017,Service was ok but the food once again was terrible! Now we remember why we don't like coming here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Mitch M.,"The Woodlands, TX",94,39,20,4.0,9/18/2015,"Solidly a 3.5 star establishment. You get chain consistency, which is actually a rarity in Roswell, where capital C corporate seems to let chains languish once they open in Roswell.  What you can expect: the latest and greatest from Chili's finely-tuned menu. Passable service a majority of the time.  What not to expect: expert service or food that wows. I cannot believe this is 2 stars. It appears a lot of passers-through have unfairly penalized the place without 1. Taking into account it's a Chili's and 2. Taking into account it's Roswell, and being in the food service industry is not necessarily someone's first pick for employment in a small, isolated town.  I enjoy coming here because I can rely upon middle-good food and mostly kind and attentive service.  So to those 2 star people, I say: give this one a better chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Pete S.,"Lubbock, TX",60,668,1647,1.0,12/5/2016,"Don't disregard the reviews. This place is absolutely terrible. Both my wife and I had an on line coupon, one from my email and one from her email for 50% off a steak or rib entree. We advised the server and she said she would check if we could use both. Meanwhile took our order. One ribeye steak and one original full rib plate. After the plates came out, the manager came out and said they wouldn't honor 2 coupons even though we had them ring up two checks. I didn't pursue the issue, just won't ever go back to Chili's again. The steak was just ok, the ribs were dry., mashed potatoes were good, French fries, the worst ever. The server only checked on us once. The store had a rancid smell. Wife used the restroom and it was filthy. Needless to say we will never go back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Lisa K.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,3,4,1.0,12/19/2016,We waited an hour and ten minutes for our food.  We ordered takeout and got it before the table food arrived. Items were missing from both meals. The asparagus had not been cooked.  They charged us two times for the fajitas. We have been waiting to speak with the manager for 10 minutes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Stanly W.,"Denver, CO",1,63,2,2.0,5/14/2016,"I really wish I could tell you that this was a decent restaurant, but it's not.  I've been going to Chili's off and on for years, and it's always the same thing: bland food and poor service. But I have to say, that is typical of most Roswell restaurants.  For some reason, they just don't get it here.  They just don't really care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Melody W.,"Albuquerque, NM",112,53,33,2.0,5/25/2015,"The management needs to organize the staff better. Everyone who waited on us was very courteous and polite, but we had to get their attention for every part of the meal, and when we arrived, they weren't swamped. Once seated, we waited 15 minutes before we could flag someone down to bring us water or asked us what we might want. Needed utensils - we looked on our own and found only crayons until we flagged someone down. Needed condiments - had to flag someone down.  Needed our check - we flagged someone down who showed us how to use the automatic pay machine at the table. It didn't work - had to flag someone down. It's the best we could do to eat here in Roswell, but we wouldn't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Tony M.,"Albuquerque, NM",625,506,94,2.0,7/20/2015,Was in town for work stopped for dinner.  Food was fair nothing great.  Service was very poor.  One point server took my glass to get more water and took long time to get back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Brian B.,"Amarillo, TX",27,3,,1.0,5/10/2016,Service was very slow.  We were seated at 11:10 am with only a handful of people in the restaurant.  Order came out wrong.  Chicken for salad was cold.  Glad this is not my local Chili's because I would definitely not be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Tom P.,"Bronx, NY",1,2,,1.0,5/8/2016,Im sitting here writing this review. HORRIBLE ! ! !  Dirty soap stained wrapped  silverware 2x's until the server physically washed then  :(((( GEEZZZ .. Look at the silverware before your wrap it  I ordered the southwestern soup without cilantro .. BAM   Out  comes the soup with cilantro... I ordered the chicken and steak... The  steak medium .. Steak  came  out well done/ I requested no broccoli and BAM... broccoli came with the meal/  the server asked me if I want to something else instead of the Brockley I said french fries...  french fries came out cold SMH ... Plus this was even busy / A HORRIBLE PLUS EXPENSIVE MEAL THAT TRULY SYCKED .....   I will not come back here again EVER / just go down the road  to Applebee's ! ! !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Cody G.,"McAllen, TX",11,3,,1.0,3/13/2016,"We waited over 45 minutes for our order.  When it finally arrived,  the food was ice cold.  The steak was way overcooked,  and the chicken was tough and leathery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Jon K.,"Littleton, CO",0,7,,3.0,1/21/2016,Located in the same parking lot as Walmart.  Good location if you overnight to get food and relax.    Typical Chili's and service The only complaint is that the initial server Alya (sp?) said NM law requires ID so I had to go back to motorhome to get wallet.   I am 62 so was surprised but went back to get.    Then i noticed none of the later customers were asked.   I asked the bartender after shift change and was told no such law.    Obviously she was at end of shift and wanted to get out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Susana C.,"The Colony, TX",273,390,372,3.0,9/5/2014,"I don't really expect a lot from a chain restaurant like Chili's but the one in Roswell isn't that bad.  We came in late on a Monday evening, it also happened to be Labor Day. The restaurant wasn't crowded but we sat at the bar anyway. I like that they have tablets at each of the table that you can scroll through menu items. I'm not sure about paying .99 cents to play some of the same game apps you can play on your cell phone for free. The restaurant itself wasn't very clean, I'm not sure if they had a big rush earlier but it needed to be tidied up. The bartender was very attentive and friendly. She kept things social all while attending to other patrons and keeping busy by cleaning things behind the bar. She made a decent margarita which I sipped while eating their Con Queso Dip with chips.  I scrolled through the tablet looking at entrees and was surprised at how low the prices were compared to the Chili's in other cities we have been to. We will def. return for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Mike H.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,10,,1.0,12/18/2015,So far 5 min at the front reception and nobody there. Then 5 min more before my 9 yr old granddaughter asked a passing server to take our order.... We will how the food is....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Wendy B.,"Williamsburg, NM",0,4,,1.0,7/16/2016,I usually love Chili's restaurants. We were visiting Roswell and decided to go there for dinner around 8:30 pm. I should have read the other reviews first. We waited over an hour for our meal even though the place was not very busy. The server kept apologizing for a mess up in the kitchen. Whatever!!! The chicken strips were soggy and the sliders were over cooked. Don't wast your time or money here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Tami M.,"La Quinta, CA",2,26,,4.0,7/13/2014,"We don't have a Chili's in the Palm Desert area so you can imagine my excitement when I saw one as we rolled through Roswell one evening while on vacation. We decided to come back the next day after doing the touristy attractions. I hadn't been to a Chili's in over 8 years and I was not disappointed. It was everything I remembered. First of all, the place appeared to be newly remodeled. It was sparkling clean. There was also a great new feature called a kiosk on the tables. It allowed you to order desert among other things and pay your bill when you were done so you didn't have to wait for the waitress to come back. Every restaurant needs this!! Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The manager was as well. The food was great just like you'd expect it to be. All in all it was everything you'd expect from Chili's. I just wish we had one in our neighborhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Vismay M.,"Richmond, TX",8,1,,1.0,12/12/2015,"When chips & salsa takes 20 minutes to come on table at the time of more than 75% of restaurant is empty, that means something seriously wrong in service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Mike C.,"El Paso, TX",0,8,1,2.0,12/27/2014,"Good food, poor service. I have never been in a Chili's with such poor service...not really sure what else should be said, however, I will try.  What should be known is if you go to this Chili's you need to bring your own spoons. I didn't get a spoon with my coffee and my friend got a teaspoon that usually accompanies a glass of iced tea for her soup.  The waiter said he would find a proper soup spoon for her, but I guess the mission proved too difficult. Also, if you order appetizers, do so with the expectation they are a part of a single course meal.  Our appetizers beat our main courses by about 2 minutes...after sitting around without anything for about 25 minutes. The above are only examples and not a complete description of the service failures.  Usually when you experience service like this it is due to going to a restaurant at a peak time, but this Chili's was maybe filled to a third of its capacity and our waiter's section wasn't close to being filled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Michell M.,"Henderson, NV",3,2,1,1.0,10/12/2015,"Awful service, cold food.  Worst Chilis I've ever been too.  How hard is it to make a hot burger and hot fries????",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
Jeff H.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,12,,1.0,11/3/2013,"While the restaurant is new and clean, they are clearly understaffed. Chilis is consistent with their menu items and food quality, this is no exception. The main and enormous complaint is the service. As in, there isn't any. We waited for several awkward minutes in a nearly empty restaurant to be seated by hostess who was busy chatting with friends in the bar area. She really didn't even properly seat us, just walking by the table we'd be sitting at and she kept on walking! About ten minutes later our waitress finally arrived. By then we knew our whole order. About twenty minutes after that, our food came. By then we needed refills---which bears mentioning because we had to keep reminding her. We honestly thought she'd been abducted by aliens. Just a complete disappointment. We could tell our sentiments were shared by the tables around us about their respective servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell
David G.,"Santa Fe, NM",1,101,5,1.0,12/22/2012,Extremely slow service.  Cold food.   Suggest you avoid and try another restaurant.   Seems a complete breakdown in management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell?start=20
Jaime L.,"Santa Monica, CA",1452,1057,137,4.0,5/8/2008,"Seriously? I had to ADD this business? Shit this place needs a remodel. ANYWAYS...I remember when this place first opened up. *OMG I'M SO OLD* They were building something, and of course anything being built is going to get a whole HELLUVA amount of attention. Cadets were tired of going to Applebees, Whataburger, and Dennys--so we recon'd the area and gave them half their business within the first 6 months. I have a lot of memories here. Like any place in this forsaken town.  I spent my 19th birthday (and my LAST birthday) here, with about 10 of my friends. They made me stand on my chair and do a little dance, which I complied, completely SOBER, and have photographic evidence of.  My friend Kevin (Buddha) and I came here to bare our souls about life, love, and loss--we took a drive after our steak and potatoes and had the *best* cigarette I've ever had. He taught me that a cigarette is best after a great meal, and I miss him for that. He's down in LA, currently being awesome.  I've had several other dinners here--good ones, bad ones.  But the most memorable ones were with my (not by blood) brother, Roy.  Roy and I truly acted like brother and sister. Here are list of things he's done: We met because his roommate had a huge crush on me. Everytime he would pass me he would say ""omaiGOSH Travis has a C.R.U.S.H on YOUUUU"", and I would say, ""Yeah RIGHT"". It got annoying after a while. When we became really close, I was hanging out in his room all.the.time.  1. He almost shaved my head. Seriously. It was RIGHT NEXT TO MY FACE.  2. I put a plastic bag over my head and said ""please kill me"", JOKINGLY, and he tightened it around my neck and I couldn't breathe for about 30 seconds. 3. He continuously fucked with me when I came back to school super fucked up from drugs after I got my wisdom teeth pulled. 4. He hacked into my Myspace profile and changed it around. Put a picture of a 500 pound woman sitting on some poor guys face, and plastered ""I'm a big fat dyke lesbian"" in every part of my profile. But the one thing that pissed me off the MOST was whenever we'd go to Chilis. He and I would have a great meal, talking about nonsense and laughing, and suddenly--the dessert would come out. He and I would sit there, staring with our forks in our hand, and suddenly someone would make the first move. Quite literally that chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream in a hardened chocolate shell and a molten fudge center made it about 20 seconds. We would sit there devouring this motherfucker, and he would TAKE THE CAKE OFF MY FORK and eat it instead. I must have gotten about 4 bites in. Totally unacceptable. Change my profile, shave my head--but seriously. Stay the fuck away from my cake. Now he's somewhere in Davis currently doing his own thing, ignoring his sister and being a general douchebag. Which reminds me, I need to call him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell?start=20
Trish D.,"Roswell, NM",0,26,,1.0,6/19/2012,"While Chilis is very good, the Roswell Chils is poorly managed; therefore, the staff and food is not worth the visit. Service is always slow. The food takes way too long to come out and is often cold once it does hit the table. I don't know why we even bother going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell?start=20
Tacey L.,"Roswell, NM",1,6,,1.0,11/24/2014,The drinks were great the service was horrible!!!! Our waitress took about 20 minutes to bring our drinks as my husband's just sat there on the bar so he just got it himself. They hadn't even started mine yet. Really???? WE refilled my sons tea from the waitress pitcher because the waitress disappeared???? Now we are waiting what seems like 30 minutes now for our food and unfortunately we need refills on drinks (from the bar) and we know that will take forever. :( Guess we should have Applebee's it or Peppered it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell?start=20
Rose C.,"Roswell, NM",17,55,19,1.0,1/21/2014,"My friend and I went for dinner. While eating a server accidentally knocked over a stack of plastic cups sitting on the bar. Another server said she would clean it up and the original server left. We watched the second one pick up plastic cups from the floor and re-stack them back with the clean cups. Almost immediately after a third and unaware server grabbed a cup that had just been on the floor and put lemon wedges in it and delivered it to another diner. Totally grossed out we asked for the manager. She came and we explained what just happened as well as our disgust. She apparently had a quick staff meeting and came back out to us and told us what we saw didn't happen that the fallen cups had been thrown away. We said no, we watched her stack the dirty cups off the floor onto the clean stack and immediately watched them serve lemon to another customer from the dirty stack. The manager immediately began clearing our plates, which was fine because we were no longer interested in eating there, and said our bill would be taken care of and stood there waiting for us to leave. Incredibly disgusting, nasty, unprofessional, and gross. If I could give negative stars I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-roswell?start=20
Chris M.,"Emeryville, CA",60,96,95,2.0,11/23/2011,"Great franchise for reliably good food at a good price. But our server took our order, dropped it off and didn't return.
