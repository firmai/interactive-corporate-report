6,Joanne R.,"Buford, GA",0,5,1.0,1.0,2017-03-02,I've literally am here right now and I have been waiting for 20 minutes to even talk to a server. We have a movie for 9:00 and I'm sure we're going to miss it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-4,,,,,
5,Kiana M.,"Jersey, GA",111,1,,1.0,2017-10-07,THIS IS THE WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!! The hostess (with the curly natural hair) SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY! She told me the wait time was 20minutes . I waited over 45 minutes to be seated! I had to literally GO INTO THE KITCHEN to get the manager ! There are flies in here!!! The server is listening to headphones an can't even hear what the hell we are saying! Never coming back in life!!! They didn't even have 1$ margaritas as advertised. We were told they ran out of cheap tequila.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-4,,,,,
2,Cosedra M.,"Riverdale, GA",50,39,374.0,2.0,2017-10-21,"Came in this location for car side service. Placed my order on line. 30mins prior but also requested for my order to be made 15mins out so that's a total of 45mins. Never the less. I get there and after almost sitting in the CarSide Assigned Parking Spot (where the also was a camera above the building) for a HOUR! I call inside. The host/waitress stated she would come out. She came out about 8mins later. She immediately started to complain about the phones ringing off the hook, and they don't have cameras on that side of building. (Remember there is clearly a camera on top of building pointing directly to carside parking. After taking my payment. She went inside and stayed another 32 mins. So I call d inside again and what do u know? She answers and says ""she has my food in her hand and walking out. Negative!! Yet another 10-15 mins until she comes out. Rambling about how they keep burning the bread for my order,so she just gave us a lot of chips and salsa.. And to my surprise as I check food, there is a barely any chips and there was no salsa. At this point. It was the worst CarSide EVER!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-4,,,,,
4,Christian T.,"Atlanta, GA",17,10,9.0,1.0,2017-11-17,"i'm here now on my lunch break and this is the worst service at any Applebee's that i've ever experienced. The waiter who's name is Tarrell has been extremely rude since the moment my coworkers and I sat down. He cuts us off while we're talking and refuses to answer simple questions about the menu. I asked which flavors they offered for the boneless wings and he grabbed my menu and pointed at the list. I asked him to tell me because I was reading a different page while he spoke and he refused to do so...after two more times of asking he   said the flavor options so fast that I couldn't understand him. he has frowned, been short with us, and not apologized for his constant lack of active listening skills which have caused us to receive the wrong drinks and menu items. we spoke with the manager and received an apology as well as a voucher for free boneless wings. I will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-4,,,,,
0,Ameri-Fit Fitness E.,"Las Vegas, NV",33,4,2.0,5.0,2017-11-19,The food was served quickly and it was very good. The service was excellent and the server Ms. Savanna was more than gracious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-4,,,,,
3,Mercedes C.,"Atlanta, GA",43,8,,1.0,2017-12-30,Where to start... no hostess at the front. Only 2 servers. Empty restaurant and yet it's a 25 min wait to seat 2 ppl. Ridiculous. Just go ahead and close this location and spare us all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-4,,,,,
1,Valeeria B.,"Riverdale, GA",30,8,5.0,1.0,2018-01-09,Service is slow and terrible I'm with a party of seven it took 45 minutes  to receive our appetizers then when it was delivered one tray was dropped then there was a 20 minute wait for the clean up !!! The attitude and appearance is a total flip not to mention our monies were nasty with hair and drink rings ...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-4,,,,,
