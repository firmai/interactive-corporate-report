14,David W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",157,175,352.0,4.0,2012-05-23,"Happy uplifting atmosphere, good food, and great drinks. Been coming to Fridays restaurants since before I could legally drink. Even though the chain has changed a little over the years the food, service and drinks have maintained their high standards. All the dishes are good from salads to steaks and the appetizers are the same with some interesting twists. Deep fried string beans, who would have thought they would be so good. You can't go wrong with any desert choice, all delicious. Now the one main thing I have ordered since before I could legally drink. The L.I.T Top-shelf. That's Long Island Icetea Top-Shelf. Don't think they call it that anymore but if you ask for it they still bring it. Mmmm Good. Great place for a good time and to help forget the stress of the day.

Last nite we had a GREAT waiter named JD who did a stellar job.  We were at Chili's a few blocks away and 5 of us walked out because of the absolute crappy service. JD saved the night w/ his repartee & quick service. I truly do miss the shrimp & grits though....THAT was a fantastic dish.  As always, we'll be back...but last night was Stellar.

My husband and I were in the mood for a suculent dessert, but we couldnt find any cupcake/bakery shop open in our area on Sunday afternoon. So we endedp up at TGI Fridays.. My husband ordered the brownie a la mode, and I had the salted caramel cake. What a disappointment. My cake was the size of 3 quaters. No joke! And I probably had about 2 tablespoons of ice cream to go with it. My husbands brownie was not as small, but he probably had about half a teaspoon of vanilla ice cream. We called the waiter and asked him for more ice cream, and he was nice enough to bring us a cup of ice cream and apologized. The waiter is the ONE star this place gets, everything else deserves -10 stars. My salty caramel cake tasted old and stale. My hubby's brownie wasnt as awful, but it wasnt good enough to make up for the disaster that was my dessert. The tables were greasy and dirty, and the bartender next to us kept dropping the F bomb every 30 seconds. Appearantly, the effing guy who effing came last effing weekend didnt like his effing beer and she thought it was so effing annoying, so eff that!

We all went there to have drinks and do the unlimited appetizer specials. He was constantly checking on our table to see if we wanted any more appetizers or drinks and when we did he got them to us so quickly it was so impressive. Not only was he tentative and quick but he was also extremely polite and accommodating. He has great customer service skills and for that I even told him that he was the best waiter I have ever had going to a restaurant period.

Our meal wasn't awe-inspiring, but it was satisfying and we all left happy. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars.  When you go to Fridays, you are expecting: 1) a meal consistent with ones you've had at Friday's before; 2) American food that is well seasoned and well cooked; and 3) a lively atmosphere. We got all of those last night. I was happy since I hadn't been to Friday's in a couple of years and didn't know if the quality had declined as restaurant trends have shifted.  Pros of eating here tonight: - Greeted and seated right away; - Decent happy hour drinks menu, $3-$6 (of course, we wanted some specialty drinks instead, but they weren't terribly priced at $7.50); - Food came out in about 20 minutes. The order was correct. Everything was hot. The food was cooked correctly and reflected their descriptions on the menu; - We had great service. The waitress was quick, attentive at just the right times and amount, came by to check if all was ok and to see if refills were needed, and took care of the check without any delay.  We all enjoyed our meals. Two of us had the Jack Daniels grilled chicken sandwich. It was good! I really liked the onion crispies on top, and the Jack Daniels relish/saucy stuff that came on the side. My dad liked his French dip a lot.

I've tried quite a few menu options, and while the burgers are the best thing I've had, their burgers really aren't anything amazing.  My last visit looking at the drink menu it says (ask about our local and craft beers), so I did. The server proceeds to name bud light, Heineken, Guinness.

As soon as my friends and I entered Friday's, the host brought us past many empty booths. After passing what may have been about ten booths we finally arrived at a hard five top table. Mind you, we are three people. Three. Not five. Not even four. Three. That's not the only horrible part. (Oh it gets worse) This table was right next to a table of 20-25. A loud party of 20-25. It was right next to a drink station where the serves would go to get drinks for the ENTIRE restaurant. Not only that, this table was right next to.. THE RESTROOMS. Why in a room full of such few people, they would sit us there? I'm still trying to figure out the answer.  Now, Alberto was our server. He was very nice after taking our order and getting our drinks. However, once he came back to bring us some lemons, he passed gas. Right next to my face. Did he apologize? This young man didn't even acknowledge what he did to us. On top of that, ten minutes went by.. Then 15... Then 20... And there was still no sight of our food or Alberto. Alberto finally comes back after a half an hour later. No food in his hands. ""I'm sorry, there's been a situation with the chicken. It'll be out soon, okay?"" Okay Alberto. What choice do I have? His manager came back with a small plate of chips and salsa. How sweet. She must have known we were hungry. The chips were gone before they even got there. Our food came out and it was pretty good. However, my friend could tell her food was sitting under the heating light for a bit too long. After waiting for that food for ages, it was so disappointing for her to wait for something that was not up to par. No one should have to experience this anywhere. Especially at an EMPTY restaurant.

The waiter was THE RUDEST person I've ever had the displeasure of meeting. We were celebrating my mother 59th birthday, since the second the waiter approached our table she has a mean look in her face. My mom asked her to take a picture and she took the phone frowning. Then we were one menu short and asked her if she could please bring one and she stored off with an attitude. We were celebrating a birthday and decided she was probably having a bad day and we wouldn't stress it. Then My 32 year brother asked for a beer and she ID him with an attitude, then I ordered a drink for my mom and she demanded an ID from my mom as well (she's 59!!!). At this point we were all annoyed already because her attitude was just almost unbearable and I didn't want to deal with her attitude so I didn't order an alcoholic drink, but changed my mind when she returned. She immediately stopped me and said she was not going to serve me and she had already informed the manager about our table because I had a fake ID. Mind you I'm 24 and I had NOT even shown her my ID once. We asked to speak with the manager and he was almost as terrible as her. He did nothing except tell us if we wanted to leave we didn't have to pay for what we had ordered, which was nothing but 2 alcoholic drinks and a lemonade. He didn't apologize for her behavior, offer to have another waiter help us. Nothing. We were embarrassed and extremely upset! We've never experienced such terrible customer service before.

63,M. R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,17,12.0,4.0,2017-11-12,"I haven't been to a Fridays for years when I lived in another state. It's easy to pass by this place because they have no sign on the street. What brought us in is the advertisement for the ribs at $12.99. We were greeted by the door being opened for us by the manager as we approached. Seated immediately and our waiter came right over. Very helpful and accommodating. We both had the ribs with our choice of two sides and our son had the fried shrimp. The food came out fast and hot. The waiter could not have been nicer. Reading past reviews I think there have been some positive changes as a result of past criticisms. Give it a second chance, if you see the big Sam's Club sign - Fridays is just before it. They really need a sign on the street!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
61,Reana K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",150,42,161.0,5.0,2017-12-05,"What a great way to stop by and have a bite to eat and drink before the panthers game! Ever since they redid this location, I enjoy coming here. The staff are pretty friendly, and service is not too bad. My boyfriend and I decided to go to the bar and sit. I'm glad we chose to do that, because service was great. The bartender understood we were trying to have a quick bite before the game. We shared a couple appetizers since we weren't too hungry. Best decision in getting boneless chicken wings and their spinach flatbread off their happy hour menu. They were good enough portions shared to fill us up, along with the drinks we had. I tried their strawberry margarita that so happened to be only three dollars Monday night! I was very pleased with my drink. My boyfriend tried their mojito that was also on the happy hour special of the day. Couldn't beat the prices and hospitality that we were given! Definitely a good place to go to before the panthers games from now on. Conveniently close by the stadium, and overall an enjoyable experience to dine in at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
