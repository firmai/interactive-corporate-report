Shelley F.,"Lincolnton, NC",0,21,106,3.0,12/13/2017,Was there for a rehearsal dinner seem quite awkward as it was multiple long tables and you were unable to talk to anyone at the find of the table unless you got up and walk there. Needless to say no one got up and walked anywhere because the restaurant was packed... Food was good enjoyed the grilled salad and vegetable pasta!! I would say if you planned on having a event there ask them is there another way for them to set up tables so that everyone feels included in the conversations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket
Paul B.,"Somers, CT",269,314,333,4.0,12/31/2016,"I have never been anywhere in the casino besides the hard rock, so I was dying to try something new.  As we passed by this place it caught my eye but looked like it had a long wait.  Much to my surprise it was only 10 minutes.  Put my name down and patiently waited.   About 6 minutes later they were looking for us. Awesome.  Very happy with how quickly the wait was(not much room to wait on a busy night like New Years).  We are promptly seated by a pretty unfriendly hostess at a nice large table. I take my menu photo as the manager walks by and says ""hey that's copyright infringement""    Not sure why or what he said it for... I took several minutes for our server to come by. Again it was insanely busy so it was fine it certainly wasn't an unreasonable amount of time. She was very friendly and fast to bring our drinks.  Unfortunately after the drinks and our order was placed we didn't see her again until the check came.   I ordered a Hawaiian pizza thin and crispy...this is where the four stars comes in.  I'm pretty sure this was the best pizza I've ever had.  I loved it. It was perfect. Crispy, delicious, cheesy heaven. Lol.  Seriously though this thin crispy pizza is insane.  I'm mad now because I'll have to drive an hour and a half to get more.   Considering tonight was New Years I will give them a pass on the relatively poor service, I definitely understand people get stressed on super busy nights like tonight.  Go here. Try the thin and crispy. Forget the service. Happy New Year!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket
Qme Z.,"Boston, MA",245,93,40,3.0,11/26/2016,"Poor customer service, our waitress wasn't friendly. Our appetizers came out before we even placed our entrees. Then the waitress asked if we wanted bread which we received after we finished the apps. It was disorganized even though the establishment wasn't even busy, with many open tables for a Saturday afternoon lunch. We ordered the following:  Avocado club egg rolls Brussels + bacon flatbread  Wild mushroom strozzapreti with chicken.  Kung pao spaghetti with chicken  Garlic cream fettuccine with shrimp  The avocado club egg rolls were delicious, lightly fried on the outside, the ranch dipping sauce with it was a great pairing.  I would not recommend the Brussels and bacon flatbread. I was expecting more Brussels but it only had a few pieces here and there on the entire flatbread, bacon was too salty.  The wild mushroom strozzapreti was good in flavor, but some of the mushroom pieces were cut way too thick. I added chicken to it for an additional $3. The chicken was dry with no flavor. They just threw a slab of chicken on top of the pasta.  I sampled the kung pao spaghetti and the garlic cream fettuccine, both standard in taste, nothing to rave about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket

Steph A.,"Boston, MA",0,2,44,2.0,9/21/2017,Unfortunately what should have been a quick in and out experience at this chain restaurant quickly spiraled into the never ending dinner. The waitress was more concerned with talking to a patron at the bar than coming over to our table which was legit steps from the bar. She didn't give us the complimentary bread despite every other table having it around us. When the food came it was good pizza but we barely were offered a refill on our drinks and then sat for at least 30 min after finishing to get our check (we are still waiting for the record). Normally I am forgiving of a lot of things but when you are out with a 11 and 5 year old who are starting to melt down because you have been sitting for at least 1.5hrs for a quick pizza dinner it's quite annoying. At least the food was good. Wish the service was actually attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket
Help Y.,"Johnston, RI",14,15,47,1.0,2/26/2017,"Do not order the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini. It's just so watery and just not worth it.

I'll just won't order it next time. The only thing that made it worth eating the damn thing.

Desiree D.,"New Haven, CT",172,421,581,3.0,1/17/2017,"Hubs and I were in the casino for New Year's eve, and stumbled across CPK. We were immediately sat, and a waiter came up to us a few minutes later. He never introduced himself, so we didn't know his name but I can tell you he wasn't to stellar anyways. We ordered the Spinach/artichoke dip, which actually was pretty good. Needed some salt- overall decent. Waiter asked us if we wanted bread, sure why not? Well, about 3 or 4 other tables have sat after us (which he also waited on) and we never got it. He served it to all his other tables though...no biggie? When they dropped the spin dip, I asked the waitress for it. It appears, this really pissed this waiter off - because he  then came and slammed it on the table- like we were inconveniencing him. He also didn't give us any oil/butter with it - like everybody else had. Previous to this trip, I never visited a CPK, So I had no idea if they served this w/ every entrée or not? But anyway- that is the service aspect of this trip. Hubs ordered a some shrimp/pasta dish and liked it. I really loved my meal, which was a pasta and veggie dish- served w/ cut up asparagus. It was delicious. I guess besides the crappy service, I would probably go back and try it out again if we wanted dinner. The waiter never came back to ask how anything was, dropped our bill and bounced....boooo",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket
Jan S.,"Johnston, RI",48,25,2,4.0,6/19/2017,"This CPK location is very good. The hostess who is usually there offers a great first impression, very friendly amidst a crowded, hungry, cranky waiting area. I told her I noticed her great customer service skills, you don't see that much at chain restaurants. CPK has good grilled salmon, great pasta with spinach and asparagus, Chicken Milanese,  pizza, dumplings and EXCELLENT pea barley soup! Good quality ingredients, extra virgin olive oil. Definitely an upper scale chain restaurant. One of Foxwoods best, Fieri's new place there can't compare.

Mish M.,"Milford, CT",4,129,76,2.0,12/6/2015,Thai pizza and cheese pizzas wee both very good  Service was extremely slow the kitchen could not keep up with the orders was very unorganized.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket
Dianne B.,"Norwich, CT",33,73,48,3.0,12/26/2016,"Dined at CPK - probably the 8th time over 10 years at this location. Today was the day after Christmas, and the restaurant was busy, not unusually, but a normal-busy. It was 3:25 when we put in for a table; we were told it would be about 20 minutes - it was about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad, but once seated in the restaurant it was apparent that the bus-service was slowing things down, i.e. there were a lot of vacant tables that needed to be cleared and cleaned. Our server was very busy but he attended to us, at first, promptly. We ordered our drinks, appetizers and entrees all at once. The drinks and appetizer came fairly quickly, but it went downhill after that, service-wise. Once we finished the appetizer (chicken, sesame, ginger dumplings which were good but a little slimy), no one cleared our dishes until our entrees were served which was a good 30 minutes later - too long between courses, for clearing the dirty dishes as well as waiting for the entree. We each had the Jambalaya which didn't disappoint - it is always consistent and delicious. We also ordered the thai chicken pizza which was so-so - it used to be more flavorful with more sauce, but now it has mostly julienned vegetables on top and little chicken/sauce. After we requested the check and to-go box, the waiter hustled at a normal/expected service-level. Again (if the restaurant manager is reading this), the downfalls were: #1 bus-boy speed at clearing tables and #2 the kitchen's ability to keep up with the orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket

We couldn't find any goat cheese on it so we asked the waitress and she said ""it's a goat cheese spread not actually goat cheese"". Ordered a moscow mule, had to order another drink because it was so sugary sweet I couldn't drink it. Low budget ingredients. I won't go back.

Jen D.,"Norwich, CT",236,42,2,5.0,12/27/2016,There's not a single time I've been to this place and been disappointed! I enjoy every mea I've had there thus far. The chicken Milanese is huge and delicious! I've also had the chicken piccata!!!! That was equally delish. The bartender/server was quick and efficient. I wish I could remember her name she was tiny brown hair and glasses. Very good! She had the whole bar and did dynamite. I also had a sangria which was out of this world!!!!!

It was only a dollar more than the regular sangrias but was totally worth it! We also got roasted garlic chicken pizza which was really good. You know it's a good place when I actually want to share evenly with my boyfriend - when we got down to the last 3 pieces, I asked him how many he had (to make sure I got my fair share). Absolutely no complaints, but the reason for the 4 stars is that it is what it is - a fast casual, affordable pizza place in the casino.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket

Philippe B.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",77,280,835,4.0,12/21/2011,"A nice place to eat and relax after a day on the tables. Food: 4 Stars In my opinion one dish reigns supreme here and that is the Pesto Chicken Pizza. Probably one of the best pizza's I've ever had (then again I haven't gone to many places who's main focus is pizza other than neighborhood small-time pizza joints). The sesame ginger chicken dumplings are also pretty good with a dipping sauce (soy-chili) was goes very well with it. Drinks: 4 Stars I have never had any alcoholic beverages here but their soda's have a very wide range especially when it comes to iced-teas and lemonades. In my 2 visits to CPK I've had about half of their lemonade iced tea menu since it (I believe) $3.99 with unlimited refills. After a long day on the poker tables where servers come once an hour or so, it is a delight to have 3 tall glasses of delicious different flavored lemonade in an hour span.  Service: 4 Stars Nothing extraordinarily good or bad about the service. Everyone seems to do their job and do their job well. Can't ask for more. If you are looking for a server one is always around and willing to help. Ambiance: 4 Stars You would think that in a busy and loud casino the restaurant would be loud, but overall the noise pollution is very low and soothing especially when one just finished playing a 5-8 hour session at the poker tables where everyone is talking and stacking their chips. CPK is a nice change of scenery from the casino. Overall: 4 Stars California Pizza Kitchen is a nice place to relax and it's price aren't overly exorbitant compared to many other places in the casino. Come here relax and enjoy some pizza while forgetting about all the money you lost that day, or brag to your friends how you got lucky (even though you claim it was skill) against a poker pro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=40
Greg B.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",30,452,4,3.0,2/10/2012,"Have you ever been to a CPK?  Well this is exactly the same, but inside Foxwoods casino.  Actually not a bad food option in Foxwoods, where much of the food is either overpriced or crappy.   The new Habanero Carnitas pizza is very tasty, spicy, and flavorful.  I am convinced based on taste that they used fresh cilantro and habanero, which would be rare for a chain.  Also, they didn't try to temper the spiciness with a sugary blend, as many bad recipes do.  The waitress was very pleasant to me.  The bad: no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to go out to the casino.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=40
Lauren S.,"Tampa, FL",601,9,,1.0,11/29/2015,"I have eaten at California Pizza Kitchen in other cities a multitude of times and had a great meal. This time however I was disgusted with the terrible service and whilst writing this I can still not tell you how my food was since the rest of my party had been done eating for twenty minutes before I received my correct meal to go. I ordered a salad with grilled shrimp on it and made sure to tell the waitress about my dairy and gluten allergy as I have at every restaurant the past few years. I got a salad with chicken and cheese on it and when I told the waitress she told me that wasn't what I said but everyone else in my party heard me say it. The manager came over after I hadn't gotten my food a half hour later and she brought it to go not understanding the ""big deal"" since I can bring it home to eat later!

Had just the right ratio of bbq sauce, gouda cheese, red onion, chicken, and garnished with fresh cilantro. It came quickly and was nice and hot...truly a GREAT pizza! Also got a Cobb salad. Actually it was a ""half"" salad...and good thing too...it was HUGE! You could tell the salad was prepared with care. The presentation was very nice and had well defined sections of diced tomato, avocado, egg, bacon, chicken, lettuce, all with a nice blue cheese dressing. All items were VERY FRESH.

He ordered the garlic cream fettuccine with chicken and shrimp and added mushrooms, I ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza. The fettuccine could have used a little more sauce but all in all everything was great! The habanero sauce was given to me in a seperate dish and was cold compared to the hot pizza but it was still good and very hot... just the way I like it.

It took awhile before the complimentary bread and oil arrived. The bread was fresh, but so hard, I was afraid that a crown or a tooth would break. I tore the bread with my hands and tried eating the soft part....too bad there wasn't much substance inside that hard crust. We asked the server how long a wait until the pizza arrived. She said about 10 mins. Well 20 minutes later still no pizza. We were told they were backed up in the kitchen. I could understand that if the place was crowded and of course would give allowance for a busy 3:00 pm day. However, it wasn't the case. We got up to leave until the server said to wait to talk to the manager. Manager was great! He asked for another 2 minutes, which of course we gave.

Love this places style low lights, tvs, round table seating (we were a party of five kinda day)  The server was very friendly and super effcient we were in and out in like 45 mins. I tried the peach, white balsamic salad, wow, it had pecans, dried crandberries, crumbly gorgonzola and just a few red onions cooked all melty. I added chicken and asked for the lunch size portion and I am satisfied but not over full. Perfect quick lunch. We tried some pizza too, my fav is the korean bbq with a veggie slaw kind of deal with spicy pulled pork...delish  Would suggest to all.  Over night at the casino? Go Park as close as you can to the restaurant like we did and just grab the food and go. Youll save alot of money!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=20
Summer B.,"Westerly, RI",61,163,35,5.0,8/5/2015,"After watching a show at Foxwoods, my mother and I stopped in for a quick bite here at California Pizza Kitchen. I had never been mostly because mom had bad luck with their frozen pizzas in the past but with a little goading this time we got to try it! Glad we did! We had excellent service, the waitstaff quick and friendly, and they even remembered my mothers mess of a drink order of how she wanted her margaritta without salt and ice on the side after I made a drink order and water with lemon. Everything came out exactly as ordered. The ambiance was clean and comfortable with my only complaint being how difficult it was to fit my womenly hips into the booth.  My seasonal strawberry mohito was great. Mom enjoyed her strawberry margaritta but commented it being a bit on the sweet side. For the food we ordered the bacon avocado southwest eggrolls and sesame ginger chicken pot stickers/dumplings. They were so delicious! The eggrolls in particular were warm and delighted my insides with happiness. The eggrolls were about $10 (you get 3 cut in half but they are pretty big) and the potstickers were $8. Drinks were about $9. I think for being in the casino this was fairly reasonable and I had such a good time and was so happy with my appetizer I have no complaints on the value. Give this a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=20
Chris L.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,25,12,1.0,10/2/2016,"Food is quite good but the service at this particular CPK (have been to many other locations and never had a problem once) is the WORST SERVICE I've ever had anywhere. Been here at least 10 times over the past 3 years. Different server every time, yet same awful service, every time! Worst part is that they go so far out of their way to not apologize or even act sorry, it's absurd. Take out ftw!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=20
Lindsay J.,"Rocky Hill, CT",68,123,43,3.0,8/14/2015,"I'm gonna tell you something: If you happen to be dining at CPK, you would be an idiot to expect mind-blowing pizza. It's just a ""thing,"" a gimmick - CPK does pizza and a bunch of other stuff but my gosh - would you expect the best Chinese food from Panda Express? No. So stop.  Service is great. Really great actually.  Spinach Artichoke Dip was solid. Chips tasted a bit stale but whatever, it's CPK and I don't expect gourmet. The Bianco Flatbread was delicious. My boyfriend liked his pizza - sausage and pepperoni.  The beer was fantastic. I've never ordered a Corona with a glass that was SO cold I could barely touch it. Nice! Bonus points for Sam's Oktober on draft too.  You'd be hard-pressed to find something better at ""this level"" in Foxwoods. If you want a better selection for food, head to Mohegan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=20
Christine D.,"Warwick, RI",43,191,9,3.0,6/23/2015,"We enjoyed the ambiance and the food was good. We started by splitting one of the small salads with arugula and asparagus which was tasty. However, the sandwich that I ordered, the California Club, was extremely minimal on the turkey.  In fact, when I opened up the second half that I was eating as I did not taste much turkey in the first half, only a few small tidbits fell out of that side.  I am not one to want piles of meat, but it  would have been delicious with an appropriate amount of turkey. My husband enjoyed the Bolognese Spaghetti although once again it could have had more meat in the sauce. I would return but would definitely indicate my concerns.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=20
Bryan N.,"Arcadia, CA",247,419,94,4.0,5/22/2015,The service was great and our food came out fairly quickly. The Original BBQ Chicken pizza is a must order.

Jason K.,"Waterbury, CT",53,328,700,4.0,6/24/2014,"Awesome service! Parking is what the resort has and the bathrooms are located in the resort itself so those need to be commented on separately. The pizza just wasn't for me. It was good, but I did not see what was so special about it - special enough to spend 12-15 bucks on a 10"" thin crust pizza? Regular Menu was also full of other entrees aside from pizza, so I do have other options aside from pizza during a future visit. They did have Gluten Free pizza, as well as other gf entrees and the waitress was very knowledgeable and willing to go in the back and ensure that it was safe for Celiacs. That was a plus. GF stuff is labeled on the menu as GF so it is easy to find. **After visiting, I saw that this place was GiG trained. Noise level was high, but at a casino that is to be expected. Decorations inside were very nice. It is a given with a casino that a restaurant should be furnished as so, but there are the occasional in and out food joints as well. For a place that is focused around pizza, I was expecting more of a plastic booth and ordering counter and instead I sat in an Italian family/party style place. The Ms. liked it. The awesome service and fancy decorations were a huge plus, but as far as food is concerned, I think something other than pizza is my way to go. Look at my pictures of both pizzas (gf and regular) and make the call whether you want to try it or go with a pasta/meat route. I have not eaten anywhere else in Foxwoods, but this is the only one that really stands out. I would consider coming back in here during my next visit, especially when with the Ms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=20
Ashley B.,"Stamford, CT",122,20,15,1.0,8/11/2016,"As you can see many of these people would consider this restaurant a five star establishment, but if you'd spend a few minutes reading over what I have to say, I promise it'll save you a lot of time, energy, and moola.  My day started off great, I'd consider my economic state ""not bankrupt, but still immediately going to the clearance rack in any store"". I was scouring the Tanger outlets in hopes of some good deals, when my stomach began to growl. I am very familiar with the area as I used to live down the road and have made frequent visits to Foxwoods over the past few years. I would consider myself a frequent CPK visitor, so it was rather a no-brainer that my friend and I felt confident we would get a decent meal at a decent price there. By the time I sat down in my uncomfortable booth my stomach roared like thunder, and my mind could not focus on anything else but the meal I was about to devour. As I stated earlier, I used to make very frequent trips to CPK and always get the same order: a Bianco flatbread pizza and mac and cheese bites. The menu lists the flatbread pizza to have gorgonzola cheese on it, but I am more of a ricotta gal, so in all of my previous trips to this so-called ""restaurant"" they gladly  replaced the gorgonzola with ricotta. Now today was a little bit different, apparently they no longer have ricotta??!? No ricotta in a pizza kitchen.... I didn't want to make a fuss, so I decided to stick with the gorgonzola and mac and cheese bites, and my friend did the same. The mac and cheese bites came out at a suspiciously speedy time, but at this point my stomach was literally eating itself, so I gladly took a large mac and cheese bite to the face, but this mac and cheese bite tasted like it had been sitting on that plate for the past year. I'm not actually sure if it was covered in breading or dust. Not to mention, inside that dust was very hard and stale mac and cheese that tasted like Styrofoam. Disappointed, and still hungry, I pushed aside my full plate of mac and cheese bites as my flatbread pizza was delivered to me. After washing down that sad old mac and cheese bite with a glass of flat coke, I took a big mouthful of this pizza. Let me tell you, that was the most rotten, repulsive, disturbing tasting thing i've ever put into my mouth... and let me tell you, I am not proud of some of the things I've put into my mouth, but this, this was the worst. I couldn't even take a second bite it was so wretched. When the waitress came over to the table I was fed up, and just wanted to leave, but I hate being rude to servers so I asked for a box for the rest of my pizza so I wouldn't offend her by leaving all of this uneaten food on my plate. She brought me a box along with my check. At this point my stomach is so empty the entire restaurant could hear the echoes of its rumbling. I look at the check, the meal was $17.. that could literally buy me 113 and 1/3 chicken nuggets at burger king that are more edible than this food. $17. I was so frustrated and let down by this meal that I just signed my receipt and began to put the other slices in my take home box. as I lifted up the last slice I saw on my plate a 2 inch dark curly hair that is clearly not mine. As my gagging reflux were triggered I did not know how to handle this situation. All I remember thinking was ""I want to throw up"", So frustrated my friend and I stormed out, let down and still hungry. We proceeded to walk through the outlets to get back to our car, but we only made it a mere few feet before she was is a frantic search for a restroom. Her stomach was so upset from this food she ran to the nearest women's restroom only to find a sign saying the bathroom was closed, she was forced to use the men's room. with our hearts full of shame, and our stomachs filled with nothing, I write this post to you, potential CPK customer. I hope you think twice about all of those 5 star reviews, because I promise you, If I could have given zero stars on this website, I would have.

Monica S.,"MASPETH, NY",0,24,85,2.0,12/19/2015,"I have to start out with saying we enjoyed our charismatic server but we have little to say about the rest of the staff. The hostess was a bit rude and did not inform us about a completed party - as we waited for one who had stepped away for a bit. Also, the food runner who came to give us our appetizers did not help removing empty dishes from a crowded table. We moved a large pizza dish to make room and she ran after leaving the food and my brother with a large plate in his hands. First, our entrees came before our appetizers; which the manager so graciously discounted our bill with the attention of our server. Fine! Great! While the pizza was good; the salad ""harvest kale..."" was saturated in vinaigrette which left the salad sour and soggy; the guacamole was more corn and the size of a baby's fist for the price and ill-prepared. The food was a toss up for us and besides Matt, I would say it was hard to feel welcomed to the place.

Marc T.,"Nashua, NH",0,95,,1.0,5/3/2015,"My bbq chicken pizza was a complete failure. There was 5 peices of chicken 1mm thick and 2 inches long. There was 1.5-2 inches of crust all around.

Yvonne D.,"Windham, NH",2,93,14,4.0,6/3/2015,"Stopped in this past weekend for a late lunch, and had a great experience. Seated and brought bread right away, David, our waiter, was very nice and engaging.  We had a quesadilla appetizer that wasn't super memorable, but the dipping sauce for it was really good.  Ordered the original BBQ chicken pizza. For our entree. It came out within 10 minutes and was plenty hot. Many people in other reviews said that theirs was skimpy on ingredients, we did not have that experience. The sauce was tasty, the chicken and cilantro fresh. A little too much outside crust for my liking, but hey, that's a first world problem.  My husband ordered a beer and I had a fresh strawberry mojito, one of their summer specials. I loved that it was not overly sweetened with simple syrup, they let the fresh berries do their thing.  We split a strawberry shortcake for dessert and we were both really impressed with how excellent it was. Home-made tasting biscuits, fresh berries, real whipped cream and lemon zest. We skipped the ice cream that also could have come with it, and I don't feel like we missed a thing!  Our bill was just under $40.00, not bad at all for the amount of food we got.  Over dinner, at the more expensive but lesser quality buffet, we discussed how we should have gone back to CPK for dinner. Live and learn.

The pizza was stone cold, and tasteless, we actually called the manager over and had them comp the meal as we took two bites each and realized it was not at all edible...  We use Cali pizza kitchen as a joke now when talking about horrible food or service, lol, and seriously California is not notable for pizza in any respect, I'm Italian and this place hurt my Italian heart, will never go back, they had a chance and messed up too bad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=20

Appetizers are all great here, my favorite though is the corn and black bean guacamole... It's not a huge plate but can maybe be shared between two people. Our favorite favorite favorite dish here is the chipotle chicken pizza , it is delicious and comes with a cilantro lime crema sauce you can either dip or drizzle on the pizza which is refreshing to the spicy pizza. Tostada pizza was good but cannot re heat with the lettuce on it. Dan had the California club pizza and said it was even better than our favorite (crazy) and even the regular peperoni and cheese Pizza is delicious. Not a big fan of the garlic fettuccine. Kung pao pasta is great. There passionfruit mojitos ate really really good!! Would recommend to any and eveyone . Even kids menu is very good.
