49,Melissa W.,"Dallas, TX",46,59,18.0,2.0,2012-04-16,"The only reason I give this place two stars instead of one, is because my server, Richard, was amazing. He was attentive and kind and had fantastic menu knowledge. The only time I will ever come to Friday's is when a friend of mine suggests it or a family member wants to go their. Otherwise, I just don't go. Here are the reasons why: The food is sub-par. The meat is always over cooked, the flavors are watered down, or the flavor combinations are disgusting. The drinks are ok. The service has always been whatever, and the ambiance is.... lacking. I think it's really trashy that I can go to a bar in downtown Dallas and not have to see one cop there the entire night, but every time I go into Friday's, there is a cop there for SOME reason. The last time I went in with a group of friends, I dreaded it. But we got a fantastic waiter who knew the menu and directed me towards something that I may actually like. Cajun Pasta Alfredo with Chicken and Shrimp. I had this once when they were test-marketing it and hated it, but I decided to give it another go because Richard, our server, was insistent that it was delicious. I'm glad I did because it was. The protein was cooked properly and the sauce was flavorful. It could have used less grease though, just saying. He also suggested the Sangria. Huge hit with me. It was delicious. Now I won't dread Friday's so much when dragged in there, but I will ALWAYS ask for Richard. He is just GREAT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

40,Lucy R.,"Mesquite, TX",26,3,,1.0,2013-09-07,"I was once a long time customer of this restaurant.  The prices were resonable for my budget, and the waitstaff and host staff were friendly. However in the last 2-3 years this has gone dramatically down hill, and today at lunch was the rock bottom depth to cause me to now say that my 15+ year patronage of this restraunt has now come to a complete close. To start off the problems several years ago, the host staff were throwing empty bottles into the air and hitting patrons with them.  When reporting to the managment what occured, the management responded with ""well, the other customers like to see them have fun.""  Patrons do not come into restraunts to get beat on the head with bottles of liquer as entertainment.  The host/ess is not Gallagher. Then on a following visit when going in with my mother, who is on a cane and honestly is in pain to walk at any given time, the host (a different one from the one above), made us walk past 10-15 empty tables to the back near the kitchen and bathroom.  When we brought this up to the attention of the waitstaff and requested a manager, the response was ""well, it was my turn to get a table.""  If it is that crucial that the waitstaff get a table on a specific rotation then they need to be the ones flexible enough to move the 40 feet to a different table.  Handicapped clientele need to be treated appropriately, not treated like afterthoughts. These problems were minuscule to what just occurred though.  While I had thought perhaps that while the service left chasms of desire, the food was acceptable to be ordered and brought home.  I did not expect to find the (wait for it... ) roach attached to the french fry I was 6 inches from putting in my mouth before seeing it out of the corner of my eye and thinking it was a burnt edge. I again called to report the issue to the management, and all I got was ""this never happens"".  Ladies and gentlemen, roaches are not solitary creatures.  They do not come individually.  If you have one, you have a hundred.  If you have a hundred, you have a thousand.  I think what was a more appropriate statement was that it has never been reported.  I almost didn't report it, but decided they needed to know from me first hand. Now, to call the health department. TL;DR: TGI Fridays in Mesquite on Towne Crossing Blvd employs unprofessional, inconsiderate staff, unconcerned management, and very bad food hygiene and cleanliness practices.  Don't eat here unless you enjoy taking your health and well-being for granted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005

39,Sarah B.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,31,1.0,1.0,2014-02-17,"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. I can deal with slow service, and I can even deal with bad service - but I do not tolerate rude service that was completely unwarranted. There is one server that's good there - but out of my three times visiting during a business trip, the first was with the good server, and the other two were with two different servers who are complete failures. They downsold, they provided bitchy and slow service. The food is good - but to me, it's not worth the treatment you get from the bottom of the barrel. I thought the second time might have been a fluke, so I returned for the third - but I didn't even stay past the drink delivery, I walked myself out. This was after we had not received our drink orders for 30 minutes, and then at the delivery, the server (RJ?) threw down our straws on the table. I said, ""Oh, no no."" and walked out.

So we stopped here last night, and the only down side of this experience was the hostess, who had us running all over the restaurant. We had a small child with us, and we specifically asked for a high chair right off the bat. She put us at a table at first and then offered us a booster chair (which by looking at him, one would know he is too small for a booster chair) When we asked again for a high chair she took us back to the waiting area and said it would be five minutes. Then a couple of seconds later, she took us to a table in a high traffic area, and then changed her mind and started to take us back to the waiting area and then at the last minute put us somewhere where our son would be out of the way of patrons and hot food coming from the kitchen. Which that was a very good idea. Now, on to the good part. Our waiter (a younger fella with glasses) was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, only bad part was the order had gotten mixed up and my husband recieved the wrong steak (he ordered medium rare and had recieved a very medium well steak).

Tables were dirty, water and liquids were spilled on the floor not cleaned.  We get to the table and see two police officers from Mesquite working security in the restaurant. What does this tell you that a restaurant has to hire security/police? It looked like a fight or a shootout could occur at any moment just based on the people that were there eating. The parking lot also seemed to have a few unsavory customers loitering  around. The food came quickly and tasted like any other Fridays restaurant.  Our waiter did a fairly good job but appeared that he was busy running around waiting on other people.

Pleasantly surprised to $10 full rack of ribs when I was only going to order a half rack of ribs for $11.60.  Thanks waiter for telling me this.  They were really good and came with yummy coleslaw and french fries.  Our waiter was pretty good and well attentive.  SLightly slow bar service on our drinks but everything else was great.  I dont go to TGI Fridays often because it doesnt have great food but it does have decent food.  We had a group of 10 people and sat seperatly but side by side on two tables.   We were greeted upon entering the business by the hostesses.  Clean bathrooms although there was a mother changing her daughters diaper on the sink/counter...made me question where the baby changing station was...but they had a seperate bathroom accross the hall that had male/female on it and it was a single room not a big bathrooms with stalls....thankfully.

7,Alexis S.,"Dallas, TX",24,49,4.0,1.0,2016-09-12,"Update:  Came back with family around 8 on a weekday. Apparently TGI Fridays thinks it's a club now? We were greeted with blaring music and told over a server we could barely hear that they have a live DJ tonight. We were seated on the other side of the restaurant and it was still so loud we could barely communicate orders to our server.  They also played the most inappropriate music ""Birthday Sex"" which was disturbing for my child, niece and nephew to hear. Do you guys not realize you are a restaurant and in fact families come here no matter what day of the week it is?  Our server barely came by the table I guess because she didn't want to deal with a family but it was ok once it came time to tip you I remembered that.  Please stop thinking you are a club. You are a bar and grill in the suburbs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
8,Georgialle O.,"Dallas, TX",77,23,25.0,2.0,2017-02-17,"So here is my issue... with this particular T.G.I F.... we came in and were told 20 to 30 min wait. As we sat and waited in the waiting section with 3 other groups of people saw multiple available tables... and Im talk 5 in eye site.... let alone how many would be around the corner.  As more people and couples came in I literally watched the hostess, give random times per couple, ranging anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half.... with at least 5 OPEN tables. We got seated to eat and also notice people who came in after us, get thier food before we even got an appetizer. We saw 3 waiters standing around having extended conversations,  laughing, lounging,chilling. I personally got the impression that this place discriminates or is completely lost on service. I understand it a Friday night and busy.... Pick your poison there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
34,Darla S.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-02-27,I can't express how horrible it was... our waiter took a while to see what we even wanted to drink... my husband asked for a Dr. Pepper but his drink looked like tea... I was suppose to get a happy hour price drink but was brought something else... he ordered endless apps buffalo wings & potato skins. .. I ordered ribs & steak medium. .. it took forever for his wings but even longer for my food... my steak was so chewy & not like I wanted... by the time they brought his potato skins I was almost done... he was suppose to have the endless apps special. .. never did the waiter cone to ask if we were ok.. how was our food... do you need a refill... my husband had to get up to go ask for a refill... NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK TO THIS PLACE... WE ALWAYS TIP WELL BUT NOT TODAY FOR OUR BAD SERVICE THAT WAS GIVEN... THIS PLACE DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR BUT ON HERE I HAVE TO RATE IT...

11,Tisha T.,"Hutto, TX",0,3,5.0,1.0,2017-03-17,Arrived at 830 and it was 40 minutes before we received our first appetizer and they were cold. Endless appetizers a waste of time and money. The bourbon chicken was good. Service was slow and took forever to get refills. Our server stated he had over 40 guest to serve.

We will be back here just to sit in her section, as she is very knowledgeable about the foods, and very personable with her guests.  She makes you feel as you are the only reason she came to work that day! The food was very good for a chain restaurant,  as well. I cannot say enough good about the service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
32,Ti'Tyonia W.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-05-20,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!! When we walked in the lady at the door told us it would be a 15 min. wait but assured us she would seat as soon as a table became available. Never asked for a name to put a on a list nor did I know of a list since there was no one else in the waiting area. After 5 mins of waiting more people began to come and another lady came ro the front to write doen names. Mind you the first lady is still at the door and im looking right at her. Table started to become available and they start calling the names on the list. My husband got up to asked why people who came after us were being seated first and she tried to act like she didn't remember us coming in. When it is finally our turn we get put a table in the back with the light bulb out. Its dark outside  at this point so we can barely see our menu. I ask if we could be moved. The waiter said she would see what she could do. Another 20 mins go by they never moved us or even came back to take our drink order. We ended up leaving,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
14,Jeannie W.,"Garland, TX",25,10,6.0,1.0,2017-06-30,"Just had the most horrible and embarrassing experience using an e-gift card here! Gave the waitress my info and asked her to take $30 off on the gift card and charge the remaining amount on my actual debit card....so the waitress comes back and I realize my debit card was charged the total amount, then there was another receipt where they had taken $19.25 off my gift card, which I told the girl to take $30 off of it and I was still charged the total amount on my debit card. So after trying to explain to her several times that she was supposed to have taken $30 off of the gift card and having her tell me there was only $19.25 on it I asked for the manager who tried to tell me the same thing, I had him check the balance of the card and sure enough the other $11.75 was still on the card, so the mistake was on the part of the waitress which he still wouldn't say, I do not like attention brought to me so I never complain or bring anything up so this was actually quite embarrassing and frustrating to keep being told that I was wrong when in fact the waitress just didn't charge it the way I asked her to, and I explained 3 times when I gave her the ticket that I wanted the $30 taken off the gift card and to charge the remaining balance on my card so after wasting 20mins going back and forth with the waitress and manager I didn't even get a sorry or anything, I come here  and pick up to go often, just brought my whole family here for Fathers Day but I promise I won't return, at least not ever to this location. The charge is still showing on my account so I'm hoping it actually is corrected as the manager said it would be, but you lost a weekly customer, didn't offer anything for the inconvenience or embarrassment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Service was okay but the kitchen did not know what they were doing. The breadsticks were microwaved. The celery were the ugliest, oldest 3 pieces of celery I've ever seen. & if you want boneless wings, you're better off buying the TGIF frozen bag at the grocery store. If the parking lot looks empty to you, don't think it's luck, there's a reason no one is eating there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
