29,Kathy G.,"San Antonio, TX",3,16,,1.0,2014-11-22,"I've eaten at Red Robin's in the past with mixed reviews. Although this particular location just opened today, I'm already disgusted with it. My daughter and I stopped for lunch. First, the parking lot was a madhouse. There were cars pulling in, cars leaving, and cars trying to find a place to park. We attributed it to their grand opening, everyone wanting to try it. We assumed there would be a wait and were willing to, but that wasn't the case. The reason there were so many people/cars mulling around it that word was they were open, they were actually only open for those who happened to hear that you needed reservations. That's right, a Red Robin that required reservations. A manager told us that they advertised that fact in the newspaper (like anyone reads the newspaper since the onset of the internet) and they had (past tense) a sign out front. There was no sign when we were there. Red Robin is casual dining, nothing fancy about it. It would never cross ones mind that a place like that would require reservations at any time, never mind at a time when the entire city believes they are having their grand opening. Poor management? Lack of foresight? Or just a plain stupid idea. We were even there at the right time to witness a minor fender bender due to the poor planning and cluster*** in their parking lot.  Not a good beginning for a mediocre chain....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york?start=20,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34
12,Julie S.,"York, PA",0,4,,2.0,2014-11-30,"The management and staff were very unorganized. When the hostess went to seat us, they took half of the table from guests already seated to provide us with seats despite several open tables. We then attempted to order an appetizer from our waitress who directed us to the on table tablet, which did not contain that item. We pressed the button to call her back, but she did not return despite stopping at our neighbor's table. The manager then had the hostess seating customers solely at the bar, hip to hip filling every seat. Again, with 4-5 open tables directly behind it.  We paid our bill on the tablet, as directed by the waitress, after which they came to clear the table although we had not finished eating.  The food was decent - what you would expect for Red Robin. However, their staff and management could use some help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

Food was prompt, hot and delicious, and the new ZIOSK machines made it so easy to order appetizers and pay: fantastic innovation on the part of the owners. Our server Dave was excellent at handling detailed orders for our large party, and he kept the kids happy with drink refills; he could guess what we needed before we asked. Great environment, brightly-lit and family-friendly, with the more upscale adult bar area sectioned off.

I ordered the mushroom & Swiss burger with fries and mac & cheese. However, i never received the mac & cheese and i had forgotten that i ordered it till i seen the bill. I talked to one of the managers that were walking around and told him about it and he was super nice and took it off the bill for me. My SO ordered the keep it simple burger with fries and a side of the ghost pepper sauce. He liked the burger and fries, but the sauce was not hot at all, sorta tasted like ketchup.

13,Nina E.,"Berkeley, CA",129,15,5.0,3.0,2015-02-09,I was so excited to try this place-after years of seeing advertisements I was finally able to visit and it wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  I had the Royal Burger and it was so delicious--I ate this with unlimited waffle fries and beer cheese. It was so good! The other person I was with got the blue cheese burger and he did not enjoy it. They were kind enough to not charge us for the burger which was nice of them. The service was okay--not the best because they now have tablets at every table where you can order your food and have it sent straight to the kitchen. This resulted in a lack of personal service. The tablet is perfect for kids though...  Not only can you order from it you can play games on it. I would imagine this would be perfect to entertain the kids on a date night out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

The only major downside is the wait staff. Being that it is a small place and always busy they sometimes rush you to bring another party in. Also they are pushy and do not yeild to the customer to the point that they are pushing you out of they way.

32,John S.,"York, PA",0,84,,2.0,2015-07-27,"Have been here 2 times now, and not willing to give them a 3rd try.  First time, went with the family for burger night.  New place, thought we'd give it a try.  2 of the 4 of us ordered what they called ""bunless"" burgers in the menu (described as coming in a lettuce wrap).  Sounded interesting, so we ordered burgers that way.  Burgers arrived, and they were simply plopped on a plate.  The waitress dropped them off & took off so quickly I could not even catch her to ask about the ""bunless"" burgers.  Tried to catch our waitress to flag her down, but could not.  So after 5 minutes or so, finally had to get up, go looking for our waitress, but found a manager instead.  He came over to the table, agreed with me that ""bunless"" is supposed to be in a lettuce wrap, and took the 2 plates back to the kitchen.  About 5 minutes later, our waitress re-appears with the burgers now wrapped in lettuce, and proceeds to tell us that we did not order them properly.  She lectured us on the difference between bunless & lettuce wrapped.  I told her to check what the menu says, and left it at that.  Later, she came by to apologize, which I appreciated.  However, the service was really lousy - the wait staff was scarce, and nobody came around to check on beverages, bottomless fries, or anything.  We were not impressed.  But I did go back a second time, to give them another chance.  This time it was just me, so I went to the bar & had a beer.  While at the bar, ordered wings & another appetizer.  The food was fine.  The bartenders were very attentive (I'm sitting right in front of them, so hard not to be).  I really cannot complain about the service that I received on my second visit, but I did find out why the table service in the dining area is so bad - the waitstaff all hang out back by a servers station near the bar.  It's tucked out of sight of the dining area, near the kitchen, and there had to be 6-7 wait staff just hanging out talking about plans for the weekend, etc....  I wanted to walk over and tell them to go take care of their tables, but the manager did not seem to care as he walked by them, so why should I?  As a customer, I'll pass going to this place.  For the money, you can get better food & better service elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york?start=20,,,,,

I got the Royale burger. It has a sunny side egg on top and when you bite into it the yolk just oozes all over the burger. It sounds weird but it is awesome! If you've never had a burger with a fried egg on a burger you are missing out and you need to try it. I got my burger with a side salad. I had to have something healthy to balance out the wings, onion rings and the burger besides the diet coke right?  Thanks for reading my review.

The food was pretty slow to get to the table, but my drink was enough to buzz me along. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful and accommodating, often asking us if we needed anything else/had any questions about the menu without reaching the territory of being annoying. My burger was solid and the sweet potato fries were just right, so I have nothing to complain about! I wasn't absolutely blown away, but I feel like this would be a solid spot for a dinner out (or at least for a round of drinks) provided it isn't too crowded.

Flash forward over 8 months later... No better. Service is still horribly slow. Ordered a cup of soup with dinner at 07:00p. At 07:11p our burgers arrived. No soup. Waitress offered to get soup. It comes out... Cold.  Okay. Enough is enough. Manager comes out. Offers all sorts of comps. Not interested. Just get rid of the cold soup and call it a day. We are not here trying to get freebies.

Recently during a visit, my friend and I ordered the chips and salsa/guacamole, and the portion size was honestly miniscule. I don't advise ordering this if you plan on sharing -- I understand that the majority of Americans are overweight, but good lord.

We always get the old reliable deep fried pickles & pretzel bites for appetizers. The tangy dipping sauce complements the pickles well. Their burgers run between $8.00-$15.00 with the majority over $10.00. You get bottomless fries with your burger. The burgers are juicy, with several types to choose from. I had some type of onion burger ( I am bad at remembering particular names of food dishes) with sautéed onions, cheese, lettuce, & a Parmesan garlic glaze which was tasty without being too overpowering. The fries are always nice & crispy with several dipping sauces to choose from. They also have premium dipping sauces you can get for $0.75 apiece. I tried some type of Thai sesame dipping sauce for my fries; it was just the right mixture of heat & sweet. I have enjoyed every burger I have tried at Red Robin's.
