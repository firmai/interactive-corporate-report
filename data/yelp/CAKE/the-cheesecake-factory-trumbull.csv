Bob R.,"Trumbull, United States",0,10,2,3.0,27/9/2016,"This chain restaurant is located in a busy mall. There is very ample and very comfortable seating inside as well as a small outdoor patio dining area which is nice. The décor and the overall ambiance gives this place an upscale feel and the entire staff is friendly and attentive. But while the place has an upscale look and vibe, it is really just your average chain restaurant with good PR. However, that good PR makes their prices a bit steeper than places like an Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's. The appetizers here average around $10.50 and the main dishes around $19.00. For two people each ordering an appetizer, main dish, beverage and one dessert to split, you can easily drop $60-$75 per person before the tip. If you order alcohol, jack that price up much higher. As for the food itself. Let's start with the menu. It is 20 pages long! You have so much to choose from the decision is staggering. I have been there half a dozen times and tried something different each time. At that rate it may well take a few hundred visits to put even a dent in the menu. Whatever you're in the mood for, you can find something here. The quality of the food is good to very good. The preparation and presentation are excellent. The portions are a bit on the smallish side compared to other chains, especially when you consider the price, but they are still enough to enjoy adequately, though you will have room for dessert (that may be the point). Some negatives, if you go at peak days/times, you might have quite a wait, it could be an hour. I have only had a wait on one trip, it was 25 minutes. Another inconsistency is the prep time to get your meal. I have had a meal arrive anywhere from 15 minutes to over 35 minutes from the time of ordering, and it did not seem to matter if the place was busy or not with the longer waits. Now let's get to the part where this place simply shines; the desserts! As their name implies, this place has the most amazing and decadent selection of cheesecakes you can possibly imagine, and then some. A full three pages of the menu is dedicated to their cheesecakes, specialty desserts, specialty coffees, iced and frozen drinks ice cream creations and shakes. If you have a sweet tooth, you will think you have died and gone to sugar heaven! And the prices are very reasonable, much more so than their regular menu items, averaging $7.50 per item. You can also buy whole cheesecakes from their display cases. The dessert portions are generous too. One piece of cheesecake is more than enough for one person, and can be split between two and still give each of you enough to enjoy. I love cheesecake in general and this place makes them an art. I have had theirs on three of my trips, though I am not normally one for dessert. Bottom line is the food is on average, very good, the portions a bit smallish, but if you include dessert, you will not leave hungry. The service from the staff is excellent and the desserts exceptional. They are quite pricey on the food and beverages for a chain retaurant, but great on the desserts. The wait times to be seated or served are hit and miss. If it were up to me alone, I would only go here for the desserts and have my meal at another, less costly chain, but my girlfriend loves the place and she's worth the extra cost.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40
Mckalia W.,"Hollywood, United States",0,5,,1.0,30/10/2017,the place really bad the truth expected otherwise the meal was unpleasantly unpleasant we went to celebrate the birthday of a friend as a family and we really expected another quality of service and even attention food my mother spends all night after going out to eat from here and the truth we had another idea of ​​what could become Cheesecake Factory A Horrible Experience if you can avoid it do not go or come here.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40
Michael D.,"Cedar Rapids, United States",1064,92,270,2.0,27/6/2016,"I would like to start of with saying that their food is always amazing! It's always what you expect and if not, better. With that being said, the service is HORRIBLE! Idk if it's just the service on the patio or what. I always sit on the patio. We had appetizers, which were amazing. While we were eating our appetizers, our entrees came out. They should've timed it better. My veggie burger was supposed to come with a salad. You would think that my salad would come out first or at least at the same time as my burger. It came out about 5 minutes after my burger came out. It was irritating. And the waitress's phone kept ringing and she didn't even notice. And we had to keep asking for refills on our water. This might just be a patio thing, but I'm not sure. I love their food and vegan options, but get so irritated with the service. This happens every time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40
Monique R.,"New Haven, United States",27,27,16,1.0,28/6/2017,"Last night our family decided to eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Trumbull.  This experience was very disappointing.  We did not mind the 50 minute wait to be seated.  Our server Erma was very attentive and polite.  What was disappointing was the long wait from the time we were seated to the time we received our food.  The quality of the food was horrible.  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya and had to send it back because the pasta was under cook.  The waitress stated that the manager will come over and speak to us but she never came over.  My niece ordered the chicken Alfredo and was not happy with her choice.  We ordered desert and that was an additional 25 minute wait.  When we received our check, Erma stated that my meal and beverage was comp by the manager.  In actuality, we were charged for a extra Cajun Jambalaya.  We had to wait for the extra meal to be taken off our bill.  Best part of meal was the iced green tea.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40

Efrain E.,"Waterbury, United States",17,40,35,1.0,24/10/2016,The waitress said they didn't have the ingredients to make 2 different things I ordered. Are you kidding me?So I ordered something I didn't really want. The food was terrible. Rice wasn't cooked all the way. The staff are either to young or inexperienced to provide the quality of service I've had at other The Cheesecake Factory locations. The restroom toilet was broken with parts of it in the toilet bowl.  This is the ghettoest cheesecake factory I've ever been too. The waitress was nice.

Robert K.,"Milford, United States",206,367,22,1.0,12/1/2015,"Seemingly in an effort to maximize square footage and maximize every last cent of revenue, this Cheesecake Factory location installed an ""outdoor"" patio, complete with wicker dining furniture, umbrellas, and faux plant life. The catch? It's not outside. It's in the mall causeway.  Nothing like the smells and sounds of bustling suburban retail along with the bright antiseptic glow of fluorescent lighting to accompany a fine meal.  They've really redefined ""al fresco"". How progressive. We came to Cheesecake Factory to spend a gift card. My memories of Cheesecake Factory were mostly on the positive side. A large, mostly competent menu of items at a slightly higher quality level than Applebee's or Chili's, in a space slightly more adorned with high ceilings and a templatized attempted at ornate.  But that's just it. This is faux fine dining, just as the patio was faux outdoor dining. It's all a ruse until you eat the food. And I guess the average mall goer that stumbles in here leaves impressed, at least judging by the long waits. But maybe it's just the effect of marketing, decor, the illusion of ""fancy"". The sad thing is, for the prices you pay here you can eat at a much more competent, honest, locally owned restaurant. The food and service will likely be better, and you'll be supporting a local business. But while much better local restaurants struggle on a Sunday night, this place was booming.  When we asked to be moved from the stale air of the then-closed mall corridor, the staff seemed annoyed. But here's the thing: it's customary to ask if you have a preference between outdoor and indoor before being seated, even if the outdoor space is fake. Service was satisfactory, but did not match the formal attire that servers don.  The food was very disappointing all around. The allegedly spicy Louisiana Chicken Pasta was bland, with dry breaded chicken. The Chicken Enchiladas tasted nothing like Mexican food, almost as if they were topped with canned tomato sauce with a sickly sweet taste we couldn't place. Everything tasted clearly reheated, further proven by the too-hot-to-touch plate of the enchiladas. These taste like frozen microwave entrees, in huge portions, carefully plated. The menu tries to be everything for everyone with hundreds of items, serving the ""Factory"" moniker well, but one must wonder how much of it is successful.  The cheesecake with strawberries was the one positive, but our enthusiasm waned when we realized the center was frozen. And that dinner perfectly sums up the proposition of Cheesecake Factory. It's all presentation, and from a financial standpoint, it works.  You just have to wonder from the fake patio and frozen cheesecake whether they care that we can now see the strings.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40
Damon R.,"Wallingford Center, United States",32,16,18,3.0,23/1/2016,"This was our 2nd time at the Trumbull location. Very short wait to get a table, our waiter was fantastic! We had Thai lettuce wraps that were very good but for a $13 appetizer they were cheap on the chicken and sauces.Bang Bang chicken and shrimp was very good. Chicken picotta was very good. We complained to the waiter on the large amount of ice in our marguerita's and the small little glass , we each drank 4  because they were so small. Godiva cheesecake was oh so good!

Intellectual Reviews I.,"Bridgeport, United States",62,76,200,4.0,14/1/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a place for good food and dessert. Never a let down. Just by myself for one glass of wine and a chicken and mash potato dinner, the cost was 28 dollars and change. Was it worth the price to come back often? No, the prices are about 3-4 dollars extra for entrees and 2 dollars extra on glasses of wine. Otherwise I would be a regular here at the Cheesecake Factory.

Now that I got that out, I have to say that I really tried my hardest to give our waiter all of the patience I could muster up while serving us, but he just couldn't cut it. Beside the bread (did I mention that it took 45 minutes!?), the COMPLETELY uncooked rice (rolling around on the plate), and complete disregard for my extravagant request to help me celebrate my sister's birthday (while exactly 9 other poorly executed ""happy birthday"" numbers rang out), I graciously allotted two stars to this place because they managed to get my Chicken Costoletta right.....for the most part.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40

Make a remark, she doesn't volunteer to fix it. When I finish it, she asks if I want a refill and I say, with NO ice this time please. Brings another one with ice. When our steaks came out, ordered medium well, they are rare. It takes an additional 20 minutes for them to pop them in the microwave.

You'd think that's simple enough for me to get. It's now 6:00 and I'm still waiting on two simple slices of cheesecake.  I know this review doesn't speak for the quality of food here. But this inefficiency needs to be worked on. All the employees don't have the support and training they need and look more flustered than actually getting the work done properly.

So far, we were relatively relaxed about the whole deal...but then the very late burger arrived, it was a nasty, greasy mess served with luke warm fries.  On top of the burger was a thick slab of dripping fat.  Completely unappetizing and we gave up and cut our losses.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=20

Tati C.,"San Francisco, United States",42,170,60,3.0,22/9/2016,"I've been to this CheeseCake Factory location before and usually its fine. I went in for dinner last night with 2 other people and was so unimpressed. First of all, the hostess working was rude and lazy. When 3 people walk into a restaurant at 8pm on a Wednesday, there shouldn't be a wait. But there was. Not sure why since MORE THAN HALF of the tables were empty! We waited about 5 minutes for a table, not sure why. Then finally when the hostess of the year decided to seat us outside, she suggested we sat at a table right next to the door, which we didn't want, so I asked her if we could sit at one of the cushioned booths instead, and she said yes but it would take 5 minutes to bus the table. I thought she was kidding! Lets be serious, the restaurant was essentially half empty, you're telling me that no one can clean the table? Why couldn't the hostess do it? I understand that they tip out a busboy to do such things but in a restaurant, the entire FOH staff should come together and bus the dirty tables especially when they restaurant is dead! I've worked in restaurants in the past as a hostess, server, and bartender, and NEVER in my life would I tell a customer that they had to wait 5 minutes after already waiting, for a table that can be cleaned in about 30 seconds. But whatever, who cares about hospitality anyway! Our server was nice and helpful, although we felt rushed at the end of our meal.  The food was BLAH. I had the Shrimp and Sausage pasta, and the taste was good. However there was only 3 pieces of shrimp and about 20 pieces of sausage. Literally, I counted. My mother had some chicken teriyaki dish which she absolutely hated.

I was expecting a long wait as in my prior visits however we were seated as soon as we entered.  The waitress took a while before coming over to the table to greet us and when she came over she seemed as though she was annoyed and did not want to be here. On the bright side the inside of the restaurant is very nice.  The bread here is amazing and always fresh. We ordered the crispy calamari as an appetizer which was excellent and as a main dish I had the Orange Chicken which came with white rice which wasn't bad. Had a different taste then the normal orange chicken I'm accustomed to from local Chinese restaurants. I usually order The crispy chicken costoletta which is always THE BEST. Also have had the Oreo cheesecake and the cookie dough cheesecake both of which are mouth watering!!  Huge portions so come here on an empty stomach.

My salad was a special shrimp salad and lettuce was pretty but didnt look washed. It was dark and I was hungry so ate most of it anyway. Server never came to check if all was ok-just kept rushing around. Understandable but dont expect a quiet relaxing meal with attention on the weekend. Idk if its like that during the week.

The place itself is nice enough. Big, bright and slightly chaotic. The bartender was attentive...now to the food/drinks... My first mistake was ordering an actual drink that exists in the real world. An old fashioned arrived and it was the size of a gatorade. Obviously watered down ruining the essence of the cocktail. The taquitos and samosas were fine...but literally tasted like premade frozen apps dropped into a deep fryer. The entree was atrocious. Pasta Napoletana was a tomatoes sauce inexplicably over a bed of what I could only decribe as alfredo?

I open the container and there are three TINY bite size pieces of chicken- not chicken breast mind you but nugget sized pieces. 3 in a chicken pot pie, surely there must be a mistake. Grubhub calls them and they say nope we aren't refunding it, not our fault. This is beyond disappointing to me, if i order a meal i expect to have it properly made and to treat your customers with dignity and to apologize for the mishap.

Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, only thought it to be over-rated, too hyped and expensive.  My wife, Mother-in-law and I were in the mall and decided to get a bite to eat. This place was close by, so we chose to eat here (even-though it isn't not my favorite restaurant I went with the flow). Wasn't busy so we were seated quickly, the restaurant was nicely decorated to create a relaxed atmosphere (not sure if all locations are the same within the CF chain).  Overall our experience was pleasant, we had no issues with our service, and we all enjoyed our food. Friendly staff, quick service, waitress was excellent.  I ordered the avocado egg-rolls and they were delicious!   I may give the CF another try in the future, before I become a fan though.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull
Leanne P.,"Newark, United States",79,113,187,3.0,4/6/2017,Just like every other Cheesecake Factory. Nothing special but still a decent place. The servings are huge which at least makes up for the prices. The restaurant is always very busy (long wait times) and very loud.  It's attached to the mall and the back wall of the restaurant looks out into the mall. Not a fan of this since it's usually the area that people wait and I feel pressured to eat faster.  The seating also kind of sucks.

There are times when the chicken tenders have been fresh, hot and crispy and other times when they tasted like they'd just been popped in a microwave. It really depends on when you go. I find Monday - Thursday after 7 to be the best times to go. Want consistency? The mac n cheese balls are always perfection. You can never go wrong with my favorite cheesecakes: Reese's, Oreo and the classic cherry. The bread is always good too: sourdough and honey wheat. The raspberry lemonade is good but super sweet...

Meggan A.,"Branford, United States",249,243,88,4.0,15/9/2014,"Standard Cheesecake Factory location. I thought it was common knowledge that they're known for their long menus and long waits, are people really complaining about this? CF is packed regardless of where it's located, so I would expect to wait an hour or so for a table, longer if you're going during peak times. Why not peruse through their 18 page long menu while you're waiting an hour for a table? Kill two birds with one stone.  This location gets an extra half star for having a text messaging system to notify you when your table is ready, and another half star for being attached to the mall. This means I can shop while I wait, therefore it doesn't feel like a wait. If I don't want/need to shop, I just go to Target (also in the mall) because c'mon, you always need to grab something from Target. Again, use your noggin' here, y'all.  Food is well above average for a chain restaurant, service is always friendly (and the one time our food was taking a while to come out, we were proactively offered comped dessert due to the wait), and I've never been unhappy with a meal here.

A mountain of sodium and sugar per serving. The plus side is: convenience. It's a chain so certain standards such as decor and music are standardized by corporate. I am not a fan of chain restaurants and this is why: you cannot maintain the same quality of food when you have hundreds of locations. Quality is reduced to increase revenue. Cheesecake Factory is no exception. Contributing to the obesity epidemic with monstrous portions and lack of fresh ingredients is not a restaurant I want to support. If your with a big group of people who want to eat and want to eat big, this is the place to do it. Happy Hour is also pretty decent with half priced appetizers and discounted drinks.

The waiter did not know what light dressings were available so brought regular instead. The food was brought out sporadically. There were three of us and we each got our food at different times delivered by different people. When I finally did get the light dressing it was horrible. It was the light mustard but had no taste. The rest of the food was delicious but the crab bites were expensive for the price. The Asian chicken tacos were great.

THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!Stopped by for a ""supposed to be quick lunch"" while me and my friend were shopping at the mall. Ended up being almost 2 HOURS from start to finish. Once inside we did notice they were a little busy, but decided to sit down anyways. Went over to the hostess stand and was seated immediately. Afterwards, no one acknowledged us for almost 15 minutes since we sat down.  While we were waiting for the waiter to come I was already getting frustrated with the fact that there were so many servers passing by and not 1 could say ""someone will be right with you"". We should have left right then and there. Anyways, once our server did come, which I don't even know his name because he never introduced himself, he asked what we wanted to drink. We placed our drink orders and an appetizer, since we were still deciding on the main course.  Long story short, we waited almost 15 minutes to get our drinks alone, and I had to ask for some bread for the table since we were starving. Once our server left the table he literally stood around and chatted with co workers instead of getting our drinks.  Then the appetizer arrived which was delivered by another server, and I had to ask that guy for my glass of water which OUR SERVER forgot. About 15 minutes later our  server came by to check on us and I told him we were ready to order our main course, but he took FOREVER to put the order in the computer. We saw him stand around and talk with co workers AGAIN instead of putting our food order in. SERIOUSLY!?  We literally waited another 20 minutes for our main dishes.  Once we were done eating, we wanted to bring a piece of cheesecake home and get the bill. Again the waiter was ignoring us or just simply forgot to check on us, and kept walking by. Once he did come back to our table we waited another 30 MINUTES to get the check and piece of cheesecake to go! That's ridiculous!!! I wanted to just get up and leave already but we were waiting for the change.  I understand it was busy but 2 other tables sat around us and they were helped immediately and received their drinks and checks before us! What kind of s*** is that!? I was getting really ticked off, to the point where I just wanted to get up and leave.  As far as the food, it was okay.. Nothing special. Definitely won't be returning unless they fix their service and staff. Hostess was rude and asked me with an attitude to move my dirty dishes from the table next to us so she can seat a party. UM HELLO LADY WE PUT OUR PLATES THERE BECAUSE NO ONE CAME AND REMOVED THEM FROM THE TABLE SO WE HAD NO ROOM TO EAT!  That was my experience at the Cheesecake Factory in the Trumbull Mall.

We haven't even left the restaurant yet and I felt compelled to leave this review.  We were a party of 8 and I get that we would have to wait for a bit. It turned out to be almost an hour and a half wait to get seated. It was my room mates niece's birthday. It all went downhill from there. First off they did not have the appetizers that we ordered. Second, besides the 1 1/2 we waited to get seated we had to wait almost another 45 minutes before the main course came out. We went in for lunch around 1 and did not start to eat till after 3pm. At this point we were starving. Here is the kicker. Despite our best efforts to tell the wait staff that we had a birthday person at the table, of everyone's main course, they bought her's out cold!! Needless to say we were not a happy bunch. The waitress did her best to apologize and the manager comp'd her meal but that was not the point. They ruined what was supposed to be a memorable occasion. Her 21st birthday.  Some of us lost our appetite because everyone mood changed. For the worse.

I finally got so agitated that I pulled a waiter over to explain that we were waiting for 20 mins without any service. She immediately helped and was very professional and sweet.

(Also, tubs of aromatic garbage rolled past every half hour or so, being taken from kitchen outlet to refuse receptacle.)  The staff is trained but very young and inexperienced and seemed overwhelmed -- the menu is vast and communication among bar, kitchen, servers, and all are still chaotic. Our waiter was very sweet and the slowness was clearly not his fault. Food was well prepared and tasty. We were too full to eat cheesecake but brought some home with us.  By 6pm there was a line out the door, so most people must know and appreciate the chain.

After being seated, drinks took between 8-10 minutes. Then we were told they didn't have the appetizer we originally wanted so we chose another. The spinach dip was bland and the chips were greasy. My husband ordered the farfalle without peas and I had the pit beef dip sandwich. The food took way too long to arrive (about 25 minutes). When we did get the food, the sandwich was bland, tough, and dried out like it had been sitting under the salamander for too long. My husband's pasta had peas in it. Since our waitress never came by to check on us, we had to flag down someone else to get a new pasta. Our waitress let us know the manager was on top of it making it himself in the kitchen and it came out fairly quickly and tasted fine. At no point did our waitress ever check on us, or apologize for the duration of our visit. When the bill arrived, they charged us twice for the re-made pasta. We didn't even want to stay for dessert since what was supposed to be a quick lunch was an hour and 15 minutes of disappointment.

When reaching for the glass when it finally arrived, it was sticky on the outside of the glass- so sticky that when I picked it up, the napkin which it sat upon was lifted too.  I told the waiter, he took it back, another ten minutes before I saw him again telling me that all the wine glasses were in the dishwasher. Finally got the wine, second glass not in much better shape. The food was ok- nothing to brag about but not bad either. Then dessert time. My husband ordered hazelnut crusted cheesecake.

We waited about 6 weeks to try it again.  I actually ordered the same food.  I was surprised that the food was overly salted which took away from my eating experience.

Our wait person was also servicing a table to our left.  Our tables were too close together...not for our waitress though!  She squeezed herself right in there but her butt was in my face and so was that napkin she had in her back pocket.  That thing moved items on our table plus kept hitting me every time she stood between the tables.  I was disappointed with every aspect of my meal....I couldn't wait to get out of this overly noisy environment where the music was was set too high to have any kind of conversation.

OK I know, I know it's a chain restaurant & they usually have long wait times... & this location is no different in those things, but they also have some good food, servers who want to do their job, & oh FANTASTIC CHEESECAKE!!!!

We had all phenomenally AWESOME GREAT time w/good friends & supreme cheesecake!!!! We didn't try any of their regular foods,  just deserts. ..all was very good, including service!! We look forward to our next visits individually & together.  Side Note to Corporation: ONE suggestion to The Cheesecake Factory Corp, while I know they don't currently take ANY reservations, at ANY OF THEIR LOCATIONS, they SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER accepting reservations for larger groups, at ALL locations. (Or at the very least do a ""trial period"" of this concept at select spots and see what sort of response they get from both customers, employees,  & sales). They could call, email, and/or text also, to confirm the details, so as to avoid no shows etc. I think this would encourage more business for them & happy customers overall. I had no issues for this visit, but just think that for the business, the community, & all in general, it'd be something they would be wise to consider.

Some nice busboy brought it to us after we waited five minutes longer. Our orders were in and we were all hungry. The children's mac and cheese was disgusting. The cheese was dried out and tasted sour. The noodles were also not soft as most kids enjoy. The icing on the cake was my meal. I ordered the bistro shrimp pasta. The shrimp are supposed to be crispy battered. Well, they were not anything as described. I've eaten at two other cheesecake factories and NEVER seen anything like what they served me in Trumbull. They were NOT battered AT ALL, and tiny, tiny, baby shrimp. They were so small, that it was a salad topper shrimp. I would never in a million years want to come back to this restaurant. I actually took out my phone and showed the manager and waitress photos of what the plate should look like, but she said the cooks and her did not agree. She knew it was wrong and the waitress told me that they always serve baby shrimp, not battered with the meal. This place is a nightmare and honestly, for $17.95, to serve baby, petite shrimp is unjustified. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone. By the way... the FLOOR IS DISGUSTING!

Kenya G.,"Hamden, United States",1,27,,3.0,29/12/2014,"Party of six. We left our name/number while we shopped as they don't take reservations. We shopped and 30 minutes later, our table was available. I received a text. Sooner than expected. The place was incredibly crowded! With more people pouring in. The hostess was visibly frazzled. Folks in this position should be unflappable, gregarious & all smiles! Mel B. Was our server. Very warm + friendly. She started off VERY strong but finished VERY weakly. Nice but forgot about us mid meal.  My dish, orange chicken, which I always get at TCF was tasty, the plate was HOT, my food was lukewarm. How does that happen? I'm not one to send food back.  Friend #1 ordered chicken wings off the app list. They were very salty. She has never been impressed with TCF & her mind was not changed by her meal last night. Oh yeah, she ordered a salad with her wings...it arrived well after her wings were consumed. Even though she reminded our server about it as she ate her 3rd wing. Friend #2 had skinnylicious enchilada. She thought they were fantastic. I took a forkful...I was not impressed @ all. Mushy and bland. Friend #3 had a side salad and Philly steak + cheese. She loved it.  Friend #4 had the chicken chopped salad. According to the menu, it was supposed to be romaine, guess what? It was iceberg! It was on the soggy side. The chicken was barely there. She didn't send it back...we all know why! Friend #6, a child, ordered the chicken sliders, with fruit salad. They were OK....she never received her cutlery, napkin. So we had to share with her. She went without a napkin, though we asked....SEVERAL TIMES!!  My takeaway? The menu is MASSIVE/ HUGE!!!!!! Jack of all trades, master of none comes to mind...except the orange chicken. Lol its never, ever bad. I've had it at 3 different TCFs throughout New England. Always the same. Tough to get refills on water. Another server was kind enough to fill in while Mel B. was MIA. She brought over water & salad dressing for friend #6s lettuce/tomato. The cheesecakes...pineapple upside down, key lime, banana, dulce de leche, strawberry all good. They could do a nicer job of presenting them. I've been to TCFs where the presentation was beautiful.  Will we return? YES! Will they always be busy? YES! This place will bring folks in who are not mall shoppers. We shopped after our meal and left after the mall closed. Folks were still lined up to get in!!

Mike C.,"Fairfield, United States",0,7,,4.0,22/2/2015,"Very good restaurant. I will start with the bad first. The two-party seating is very close together and the restaurant gets very busy.  There are no reservations and the wait time can be 2 to 2 1/2 hours on a busy weekend. The restaurant does however have a text message notification system that will alert you when your table is ready via text message; so you can walk around the mall while you're waiting.  I have never had to wait longer than an hour. I have been to Danbury, Palisades Mall and West Hartford.  This restaurant definitely puts out some of the better food.  The portions are plenty, the presentation is neat and the quality is there. The front of house staff is usually very good; personable and well-trained.  I have been there five times and only once had a waiter that was average, the rest were great. Best time to go is off hours on a weekday.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140
Ralphie F.,"Bridgeport, United States",1,150,608,3.0,24/9/2014,"MIXED FOOD EXPERIENCE.  We went here on a Tuesday and were very surprised how busy this restaurant was.  The inside is very warm and inviting.  If it weren't for the windows leading to the inside of the Trumbull Mall, you'd never know you were there.  We came to celebrate a birthday and were not disappointed in how the entire staff took the time to wish us a Happy Birthday.   The mixed experience had to do with overall taste.  It clearly has to do with the overwhelming menu choices.  I'll list what we had and rate them individually due to the flavor inconsistencies. 1.  Avocado Rolls, 3 stars.  Chewy 2.  Chicken and Mushroom lettuce wrap, 4 stars.  I would have given it 5 stars but I got one piece of lettuce that was just the right size and the rest were too small for the filling.  Great flavor 3.  Cuban Sandwich 1 star.  It tasted nothing like a Cuban and had a sauce that was similar to tarter sauce, which made each bite unpleasant. 4.  Spicy Chicken Chipolte Pasta ,1 star and it was sent back due to unsavory flavor and it came with just a few chunks of chicken. 5.  Stuffed Chicken Tortillas, 2 stars.  Lacked flavor, was forgettable. 6.  Chicken Madeira, 5 stars.  Chicken was soft and flavorful.  It has plate licking qualities. 7.  Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane, 5 stars.  I already described the mouth watering chicken.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was satisfying to the palate.   8.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, 5 stars.  Big enough for two to share. 9.  Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, 3 stars.  Big enough for two but too rich for my taste buds. I was a little surprised that, for the prices they charge, a soup or salad was not included with our main course meals, 2 stars.  If you are going to charge these prices, you should be providing more.  A basic bottle of The Cheesecake Beringer wine was $32. No one was overwhelmingly impressed with this dining experience.  I'm glad we tried it, but probably will not return.  Too many unsatisfied taste buds to justify a return visit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140
Joseph L.,"Fairfield, United States",53,98,169,4.0,20/8/2014,"Keeping in mind that this location is brand new and just opened up for less than a month, they're still working out some kinks.  I've always been a big Cheesecake Factory fan, which is why I wasn't surprised that this place was completely packed Sunday night.  If you are going in with a party of 2 it shouldn't be too bad, my wife and I waited for about 30 minutes but I like the fact that they have text message system rather than the little vibrating sensors that let you know your table's ready.  It allows you to go further away from the restaurant and shop the mall while you wait and not miss the alert.  Bigger parties, you'll probably be waiting an hour or more depending on what time you go.   After reading the few reviews posted so far I was trying to keep my expectations in check and not being over hyped.  We had 2 waitresses attending our table which was great, probably 1 in training.  Joclyn was very professional and attentive.  We got our drinks and bread quickly and the bread was very fresh and still warm. We ordered the Fire Cracker Salmon Rolls for appetizer which came out at a reasonable pace.  For entrees we had 2 different pastas, both arrived at the same time and still very hot and fresh.  I was also surprised that they were seasoned very well and portion size was excellent as usual with Cheesecake Factory.   I couldn't say the same for the table next to us, they had some issues with their order (too much cheese on their pizza... wth?)  Anyway, we also got the banana cream cheese cake which was very smooth and delish.  Overall, we had an excellent experience this time and I hope it'll continue the next time we return.  I was happy with the service we received from Joclyn and no complaints about the food despite the other reviews and our neighboring table.   There can be room for improvement at the entrance as it gets pretty crazy crowded during times and confusion occurs as some people picking up take out or just buying cheese cake get all mingled with the other restaurant guests waiting for tables. The front end people seemed kind of stressed as they don't really smile or act alert when guests try to get their attention, but I assume their just really trying to focus on seating everyone.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140

I wasn't expecting anything exciting, just basic.The place was very busy to begin with. We had to wait for 30 minutes so we walked around the mall. When I opened the menu I was overwhelmed by the extensive list of choices. I kept saying to myself with all of these choices how can the food be any good. It was a long time before we finally got glasses of water and then awhile more before our wine arrived. We wanted to start with the ricotta and meatballs appetizer but after placing the order Lauren came back and said they were out so we decided on the roasted pear and blue cheese flat bread. It arrived and the pears did not look roasted and were cut in large chunks(should have been much much smaller or thinly sliced) but overall it had good flavor. Bread never came to the table and we didn't think to ask until we were half way done with the meals. Oh and another thing it took forever to get utensils and napkins. We had to use the cocktail napkin with the appetizer. I ordered the Shepard's pie with apprehension but have not had it in ages and was curious. It was actually really good, I was very surprised for a chain restaurant to make it very tasty. My other half had the chicken marsala and he said it had good flavor but needed more sauce and wished the pasta had been cooked a bit more. I was hoping the lemon cake was on the dessert menu because I had it several years ago at the Fort Lauderdale location and thought it was good. They changed it a bit but it was still quite good. My other half had the dulce de leche cheesecake and enjoyed it very much. Overall not a bad experience but service was lacking and needs to be fixed.

Ralph B.,"Trumbull, United States",0,27,3,2.0,28/8/2014,"We have enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory in other locations, but were disappointed with our family's first visit to the new Trumbull site.  There was a minimal wait that evening to be seated, which was a pleasant departure from typical one hour waits at the company's restaurants.  Unfortunately, we were repeatedly reminded by our servers just how busy they were and left waiting for long periods to order our food and be served.  When a dinner arrived with the wrong side vegetable, the server dismissively insisted it was correct (it was not) and added that the desired vegetable would require an additional charge.  Another server arrived a moment later with our remaining order and immediately agreed it was the wrong side vegetable and promptly replaced it.  We subsequently ordered 3 deserts to go and after an interminable wait of more than twenty minutes opted to cancel that order rather than to continue to wait.  A manager came over to apologize and explain how incredibly busy the bakery was from many walk-in orders.  She described a perplexing process where despite our being a customer at the restaurant for the past hour, upon ordering our desert we were now at the mercy of a ticketing queue in the bakery.  She suggested there was nothing she could do about the wait and offered absolutely nothing else (e.g. free desert; some discount upon a return visit; etc.) for our inconvenience. This is unacceptable and much better service and response is expected given that dining for a family of four at the restaurant is not inexpensive.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=160

I went in for dinner last night with 2 other people and was so unimpressed. First of all, the hostess working was rude and lazy. When 3 people walk into a restaurant at 8pm on a Wednesday, there shouldn't be a wait. But there was. Not sure why since MORE THAN HALF of the tables were empty! We waited about 5 minutes for a table, not sure why. Then finally when the hostess of the year decided to seat us outside, she suggested we sat at a table right next to the door, which we didn't want, so I asked her if we could sit at one of the cushioned booths instead, and she said yes but it would take 5 minutes to bus the table. I thought she was kidding! Lets be serious, the restaurant was essentially half empty, you're telling me that no one can clean the table? Why couldn't the hostess do it? I understand that they tip out a busboy to do such things but in a restaurant, the entire FOH staff should come together and bus the dirty tables especially when they restaurant is dead! I've worked in restaurants in the past as a hostess, server, and bartender, and NEVER in my life would I tell a customer that they had to wait 5 minutes after already waiting, for a table that can be cleaned in about 30 seconds. But whatever, who cares about hospitality anyway! Our server was nice and helpful, although we felt rushed at the end of our meal.  The food was BLAH. I had the Shrimp and Sausage pasta, and the taste was good. However there was only 3 pieces of shrimp and about 20 pieces of sausage. Literally, I counted. My mother had some chicken teriyaki dish which she absolutely hated.

On the bright side the inside of the restaurant is very nice.  The bread here is amazing and always fresh. We ordered the crispy calamari as an appetizer which was excellent and as a main dish I had the Orange Chicken which came with white rice which wasn't bad. Had a different taste then the normal orange chicken I'm accustomed to from local Chinese restaurants. I usually order The crispy chicken costoletta which is always THE BEST. Also have had the Oreo cheesecake and the cookie dough cheesecake both of which are mouth watering!!  Huge portions so come here on an empty stomach.

This is beyond disappointing to me, if i order a meal i expect to have it properly made and to treat your customers with dignity and to apologize for the mishap.

Maya P.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,229,467,3.0,6/28/2016,"As with most franchise restaurants, you never know what kind of service you're gonna get when you go. I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory dozens of times since its grand opening. I've had really good waiters and some horrible ones. There are times when the chicken tenders have been fresh, hot and crispy and other times when they tasted like they'd just been popped in a microwave. It really depends on when you go. I find Monday - Thursday after 7 to be the best times to go. Want consistency? The mac n cheese balls are always perfection. You can never go wrong with my favorite cheesecakes: Reese's, Oreo and the classic cherry. The bread is always good too: sourdough and honey wheat. The raspberry lemonade is good but super sweet...

Ralph B.,"Trumbull, CT",0,27,3,2.0,8/28/2014,"We have enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory in other locations, but were disappointed with our family's first visit to the new Trumbull site.  There was a minimal wait that evening to be seated, which was a pleasant departure from typical one hour waits at the company's restaurants.  Unfortunately, we were repeatedly reminded by our servers just how busy they were and left waiting for long periods to order our food and be served.  When a dinner arrived with the wrong side vegetable, the server dismissively insisted it was correct (it was not) and added that the desired vegetable would require an additional charge.  Another server arrived a moment later with our remaining order and immediately agreed it was the wrong side vegetable and promptly replaced it.  We subsequently ordered 3 deserts to go and after an interminable wait of more than twenty minutes opted to cancel that order rather than to continue to wait.  A manager came over to apologize and explain how incredibly busy the bakery was from many walk-in orders.  She described a perplexing process where despite our being a customer at the restaurant for the past hour, upon ordering our desert we were now at the mercy of a ticketing queue in the bakery.  She suggested there was nothing she could do about the wait and offered absolutely nothing else (e.g. free desert; some discount upon a return visit; etc.) for our inconvenience.

Bob R.,"Trumbull, CT",0,10,2,3.0,9/27/2016,"This chain restaurant is located in a busy mall. There is very ample and very comfortable seating inside as well as a small outdoor patio dining area which is nice. The décor and the overall ambiance gives this place an upscale feel and the entire staff is friendly and attentive. But while the place has an upscale look and vibe, it is really just your average chain restaurant with good PR. However, that good PR makes their prices a bit steeper than places like an Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's. The appetizers here average around $10.50 and the main dishes around $19.00. For two people each ordering an appetizer, main dish, beverage and one dessert to split, you can easily drop $60-$75 per person before the tip. If you order alcohol, jack that price up much higher. As for the food itself. Let's start with the menu. It is 20 pages long! You have so much to choose from the decision is staggering. I have been there half a dozen times and tried something different each time. At that rate it may well take a few hundred visits to put even a dent in the menu. Whatever you're in the mood for, you can find something here. The quality of the food is good to very good. The preparation and presentation are excellent. The portions are a bit on the smallish side compared to other chains, especially when you consider the price, but they are still enough to enjoy adequately, though you will have room for dessert (that may be the point). Some negatives, if you go at peak days/times, you might have quite a wait, it could be an hour. I have only had a wait on one trip, it was 25 minutes. Another inconsistency is the prep time to get your meal. I have had a meal arrive anywhere from 15 minutes to over 35 minutes from the time of ordering, and it did not seem to matter if the place was busy or not with the longer waits. Now let's get to the part where this place simply shines; the desserts! As their name implies, this place has the most amazing and decadent selection of cheesecakes you can possibly imagine, and then some. A full three pages of the menu is dedicated to their cheesecakes, specialty desserts, specialty coffees, iced and frozen drinks ice cream creations and shakes. If you have a sweet tooth, you will think you have died and gone to sugar heaven! And the prices are very reasonable, much more so than their regular menu items, averaging $7.50 per item. You can also buy whole cheesecakes from their display cases. The dessert portions are generous too. One piece of cheesecake is more than enough for one person, and can be split between two and still give each of you enough to enjoy. I love cheesecake in general and this place makes them an art. I have had theirs on three of my trips, though I am not normally one for dessert. Bottom line is the food is on average, very good, the portions a bit smallish, but if you include dessert, you will not leave hungry. The service from the staff is excellent and the desserts exceptional. They are quite pricey on the food and beverages for a chain retaurant, but great on the desserts. The wait times to be seated or served are hit and miss. If it were up to me alone, I would only go here for the desserts and have my meal at another, less costly chain, but my girlfriend loves the place and she's worth the extra cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40

You would think that my salad would come out first or at least at the same time as my burger. It came out about 5 minutes after my burger came out. It was irritating.

Robert K.,"Milford, CT",206,369,22,1.0,1/12/2015,"Seemingly in an effort to maximize square footage and maximize every last cent of revenue, this Cheesecake Factory location installed an ""outdoor"" patio, complete with wicker dining furniture, umbrellas, and faux plant life. The catch? It's not outside. It's in the mall causeway.  Nothing like the smells and sounds of bustling suburban retail along with the bright antiseptic glow of fluorescent lighting to accompany a fine meal.  They've really redefined ""al fresco"". How progressive. We came to Cheesecake Factory to spend a gift card. My memories of Cheesecake Factory were mostly on the positive side. A large, mostly competent menu of items at a slightly higher quality level than Applebee's or Chili's, in a space slightly more adorned with high ceilings and a templatized attempted at ornate.  But that's just it. This is faux fine dining, just as the patio was faux outdoor dining. It's all a ruse until you eat the food. And I guess the average mall goer that stumbles in here leaves impressed, at least judging by the long waits. But maybe it's just the effect of marketing, decor, the illusion of ""fancy"". The sad thing is, for the prices you pay here you can eat at a much more competent, honest, locally owned restaurant. The food and service will likely be better, and you'll be supporting a local business. But while much better local restaurants struggle on a Sunday night, this place was booming.  When we asked to be moved from the stale air of the then-closed mall corridor, the staff seemed annoyed. But here's the thing: it's customary to ask if you have a preference between outdoor and indoor before being seated, even if the outdoor space is fake. Service was satisfactory, but did not match the formal attire that servers don.  The food was very disappointing all around. The allegedly spicy Louisiana Chicken Pasta was bland, with dry breaded chicken. The Chicken Enchiladas tasted nothing like Mexican food, almost as if they were topped with canned tomato sauce with a sickly sweet taste we couldn't place. Everything tasted clearly reheated, further proven by the too-hot-to-touch plate of the enchiladas. These taste like frozen microwave entrees, in huge portions, carefully plated. The menu tries to be everything for everyone with hundreds of items, serving the ""Factory"" moniker well, but one must wonder how much of it is successful.  The cheesecake with strawberries was the one positive, but our enthusiasm waned when we realized the center was frozen. And that dinner perfectly sums up the proposition of Cheesecake Factory. It's all presentation, and from a financial standpoint, it works.  You just have to wonder from the fake patio and frozen cheesecake whether they care that we can now see the strings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=40

I wasn't expecting anything exciting, just basic.The place was very busy to begin with. We had to wait for 30 minutes so we walked around the mall. When I opened the menu I was overwhelmed by the extensive list of choices. I kept saying to myself with all of these choices how can the food be any good. It was a long time before we finally got glasses of water and then awhile more before our wine arrived. We wanted to start with the ricotta and meatballs appetizer but after placing the order Lauren came back and said they were out so we decided on the roasted pear and blue cheese flat bread. It arrived and the pears did not look roasted and were cut in large chunks(should have been much much smaller or thinly sliced) but overall it had good flavor. Bread never came to the table and we didn't think to ask until we were half way done with the meals. Oh and another thing it took forever to get utensils and napkins. We had to use the cocktail napkin with the appetizer. I ordered the Shepard's pie with apprehension but have not had it in ages and was curious. It was actually really good, I was very surprised for a chain restaurant to make it very tasty. My other half had the chicken marsala and he said it had good flavor but needed more sauce and wished the pasta had been cooked a bit more. I was hoping the lemon cake was on the dessert menu because I had it several years ago at the Fort Lauderdale location and thought it was good. They changed it a bit but it was still quite good. My other half had the dulce de leche cheesecake and enjoyed it very much. Overall not a bad experience but service was lacking and needs to be fixed.

Meggan A.,"Branford, CT",249,243,88,4.0,9/15/2014,"Standard Cheesecake Factory location. I thought it was common knowledge that they're known for their long menus and long waits, are people really complaining about this? CF is packed regardless of where it's located, so I would expect to wait an hour or so for a table, longer if you're going during peak times. Why not peruse through their 18 page long menu while you're waiting an hour for a table? Kill two birds with one stone.  This location gets an extra half star for having a text messaging system to notify you when your table is ready, and another half star for being attached to the mall. This means I can shop while I wait, therefore it doesn't feel like a wait. If I don't want/need to shop, I just go to Target (also in the mall) because c'mon, you always need to grab something from Target. Again, use your noggin' here, y'all.  Food is well above average for a chain restaurant, service is always friendly (and the one time our food was taking a while to come out, we were proactively offered comped dessert due to the wait), and I've never been unhappy with a meal here.

We look forward to our next visits individually & together.  Side Note to Corporation: ONE suggestion to The Cheesecake Factory Corp, while I know they don't currently take ANY reservations, at ANY OF THEIR LOCATIONS, they SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER accepting reservations for larger groups, at ALL locations. (Or at the very least do a ""trial period"" of this concept at select spots and see what sort of response they get from both customers, employees,  & sales). They could call, email, and/or text also, to confirm the details, so as to avoid no shows etc. I think this would encourage more business for them & happy customers overall.

As for the food, it always looks appealing on the menu and even on the warm plate itself... however, the taste is either completely bland or ordinary. For a place that charges the prices that they do for their dishes, I expect more flavor -- or at least something to write home about. But sadly, this is never the case.

Dorothy R.,"Ellenburg Depot, NY",0,7,,3.0,2/28/2016,I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. This experience was not up to par mostly due to service. It was busy but not overly crowded. The waiter did not know what light dressings were available so brought regular instead. The food was brought out sporadically. There were three of us and we each got our food at different times delivered by different people. When I finally did get the light dressing it was horrible. It was the light mustard but had no taste. The rest of the food was delicious but the crab bites were expensive for the price. The Asian chicken tacos were great. I don't usually write reviews but I really like that Cheesecake Factory has a light menu that tastes good.

Dominique S.,"Stamford, CT",3,29,5,1.0,8/16/2015,"Ugh where do I begin!? THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!Stopped by for a ""supposed to be quick lunch"" while me and my friend were shopping at the mall. Ended up being almost 2 HOURS from start to finish. Once inside we did notice they were a little busy, but decided to sit down anyways. Went over to the hostess stand and was seated immediately. Afterwards, no one acknowledged us for almost 15 minutes since we sat down.  While we were waiting for the waiter to come I was already getting frustrated with the fact that there were so many servers passing by and not 1 could say ""someone will be right with you"". We should have left right then and there. Anyways, once our server did come, which I don't even know his name because he never introduced himself, he asked what we wanted to drink. We placed our drink orders and an appetizer, since we were still deciding on the main course.  Long story short, we waited almost 15 minutes to get our drinks alone, and I had to ask for some bread for the table since we were starving. Once our server left the table he literally stood around and chatted with co workers instead of getting our drinks.  Then the appetizer arrived which was delivered by another server, and I had to ask that guy for my glass of water which OUR SERVER forgot. About 15 minutes later our  server came by to check on us and I told him we were ready to order our main course, but he took FOREVER to put the order in the computer. We saw him stand around and talk with co workers AGAIN instead of putting our food order in. SERIOUSLY!?  We literally waited another 20 minutes for our main dishes.  Once we were done eating, we wanted to bring a piece of cheesecake home and get the bill. Again the waiter was ignoring us or just simply forgot to check on us, and kept walking by. Once he did come back to our table we waited another 30 MINUTES to get the check and piece of cheesecake to go! That's ridiculous!!! I wanted to just get up and leave already but we were waiting for the change.  I understand it was busy but 2 other tables sat around us and they were helped immediately and received their drinks and checks before us! What kind of s*** is that!? I was getting really ticked off, to the point where I just wanted to get up and leave.  As far as the food, it was okay.. Nothing special. Definitely won't be returning unless they fix their service and staff. Hostess was rude and asked me with an attitude to move my dirty dishes from the table next to us so she can seat a party. UM HELLO LADY WE PUT OUR PLATES THERE BECAUSE NO ONE CAME AND REMOVED THEM FROM THE TABLE SO WE HAD NO ROOM TO EAT!  That was my experience at the Cheesecake Factory in the Trumbull Mall.

We haven't even left the restaurant yet and I felt compelled to leave this review.  We were a party of 8 and I get that we would have to wait for a bit. It turned out to be almost an hour and a half wait to get seated. It was my room mates niece's birthday. It all went downhill from there. First off they did not have the appetizers that we ordered. Second, besides the 1 1/2 we waited to get seated we had to wait almost another 45 minutes before the main course came out. We went in for lunch around 1 and did not start to eat till after 3pm. At this point we were starving. Here is the kicker. Despite our best efforts to tell the wait staff that we had a birthday person at the table, of everyone's main course, they bought her's out cold!! Needless to say we were not a happy bunch. The waitress did her best to apologize and the manager comp'd her meal but that was not the point. They ruined what was supposed to be a memorable occasion. Her 21st birthday.  Some of us lost our appetite because everyone mood changed. For the worse.

The staff is trained but very young and inexperienced and seemed overwhelmed -- the menu is vast and communication among bar, kitchen, servers, and all are still chaotic.

My husband ordered the farfalle without peas and I had the pit beef dip sandwich. The food took way too long to arrive (about 25 minutes). When we did get the food, the sandwich was bland, tough, and dried out like it had been sitting under the salamander for too long. My husband's pasta had peas in it. Since our waitress never came by to check on us, we had to flag down someone else to get a new pasta. Our waitress let us know the manager was on top of it making it himself in the kitchen and it came out fairly quickly and tasted fine. At no point did our waitress ever check on us, or apologize for the duration of our visit. When the bill arrived, they charged us twice for the re-made pasta.

Finally got the wine, second glass not in much better shape. The food was ok- nothing to brag about but not bad either. Then dessert time. My husband ordered hazelnut crusted cheesecake.

When we received the text message that our table was ready, it was an additional 5 minutes, since they seemed flustered and behind. We didn't receive silverware when we sat down. The bread provided to our table was just the oatmeal bread and not white bread. No mention from our waitress that it was coming. No straws for our beverage still no white bread. Some nice busboy brought it to us after we waited five minutes longer. Our orders were in and we were all hungry. The children's mac and cheese was disgusting. The cheese was dried out and tasted sour. The noodles were also not soft as most kids enjoy. The icing on the cake was my meal. I ordered the bistro shrimp pasta. The shrimp are supposed to be crispy battered. Well, they were not anything as described. I've eaten at two other cheesecake factories and NEVER seen anything like what they served me in Trumbull. They were NOT battered AT ALL, and tiny, tiny, baby shrimp. They were so small, that it was a salad topper shrimp. I would never in a million years want to come back to this restaurant. I actually took out my phone and showed the manager and waitress photos of what the plate should look like, but she said the cooks and her did not agree. She knew it was wrong and the waitress told me that they always serve baby shrimp, not battered with the meal. This place is a nightmare and honestly, for $17.95, to serve baby, petite shrimp is unjustified. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone. By the way... the FLOOR IS DISGUSTING!

Kenya G.,"Hamden, CT",1,27,,3.0,12/29/2014,"Party of six. We left our name/number while we shopped as they don't take reservations. We shopped and 30 minutes later, our table was available. I received a text. Sooner than expected. The place was incredibly crowded! With more people pouring in. The hostess was visibly frazzled. Folks in this position should be unflappable, gregarious & all smiles! Mel B. Was our server. Very warm + friendly. She started off VERY strong but finished VERY weakly. Nice but forgot about us mid meal.  My dish, orange chicken, which I always get at TCF was tasty, the plate was HOT, my food was lukewarm. How does that happen? I'm not one to send food back.  Friend #1 ordered chicken wings off the app list. They were very salty. She has never been impressed with TCF & her mind was not changed by her meal last night. Oh yeah, she ordered a salad with her wings...it arrived well after her wings were consumed. Even though she reminded our server about it as she ate her 3rd wing. Friend #2 had skinnylicious enchilada. She thought they were fantastic. I took a forkful...I was not impressed @ all. Mushy and bland. Friend #3 had a side salad and Philly steak + cheese. She loved it.  Friend #4 had the chicken chopped salad. According to the menu, it was supposed to be romaine, guess what? It was iceberg! It was on the soggy side. The chicken was barely there. She didn't send it back...we all know why! Friend #6, a child, ordered the chicken sliders, with fruit salad. They were OK....she never received her cutlery, napkin. So we had to share with her. She went without a napkin, though we asked....SEVERAL TIMES!!  My takeaway? The menu is MASSIVE/ HUGE!!!!!! Jack of all trades, master of none comes to mind...except the orange chicken. Lol its never, ever bad. I've had it at 3 different TCFs throughout New England. Always the same. Tough to get refills on water. Another server was kind enough to fill in while Mel B. was MIA. She brought over water & salad dressing for friend #6s lettuce/tomato. The cheesecakes...pineapple upside down, key lime, banana, dulce de leche, strawberry all good. They could do a nicer job of presenting them. I've been to TCFs where the presentation was beautiful.  Will we return? YES! Will they always be busy? YES! This place will bring folks in who are not mall shoppers. We shopped after our meal and left after the mall closed. Folks were still lined up to get in!! The parking lot was jam packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140
Mike C.,"Fairfield, CT",0,7,,4.0,2/22/2015,"Very good restaurant. I will start with the bad first. The two-party seating is very close together and the restaurant gets very busy.  There are no reservations and the wait time can be 2 to 2 1/2 hours on a busy weekend. The restaurant does however have a text message notification system that will alert you when your table is ready via text message; so you can walk around the mall while you're waiting.  I have never had to wait longer than an hour. I have been to Danbury, Palisades Mall and West Hartford.  This restaurant definitely puts out some of the better food.  The portions are plenty, the presentation is neat and the quality is there. The front of house staff is usually very good; personable and well-trained.  I have been there five times and only once had a waiter that was average, the rest were great. Best time to go is off hours on a weekday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140
Ali C.,"Trumbull, CT",0,12,,3.0,2/3/2016,"Not sure what to say about this place except for incredibly inconsistent. When it's a good night there, it's great! When it's not a good night, it's really bad. I've been here probably about 10 times and sometimes servers are great and other times they're terrible. Some of the food is really great! Other dishes are not. Bread is great when it comes out warm, but can be terrible when it comes out cold. I sometimes ask for special requests because of dietary restrictions or preferences and some times it's perfect, other times I have sent the meal BACK TWICE. I really want to love this place but unfortunately it's a bit difficult sometimes. I will say, however, that their apple crisp, Godiva cheesecake, and cookie dough cheesecake are great and have always enjoyed those!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140
Ralphie F.,"Bridgeport, CT",1,150,608,3.0,9/24/2014,"MIXED FOOD EXPERIENCE.  We went here on a Tuesday and were very surprised how busy this restaurant was.  The inside is very warm and inviting.  If it weren't for the windows leading to the inside of the Trumbull Mall, you'd never know you were there.  We came to celebrate a birthday and were not disappointed in how the entire staff took the time to wish us a Happy Birthday.   The mixed experience had to do with overall taste.  It clearly has to do with the overwhelming menu choices.  I'll list what we had and rate them individually due to the flavor inconsistencies. 1.  Avocado Rolls, 3 stars.  Chewy 2.  Chicken and Mushroom lettuce wrap, 4 stars.  I would have given it 5 stars but I got one piece of lettuce that was just the right size and the rest were too small for the filling.  Great flavor 3.  Cuban Sandwich 1 star.  It tasted nothing like a Cuban and had a sauce that was similar to tarter sauce, which made each bite unpleasant. 4.  Spicy Chicken Chipolte Pasta ,1 star and it was sent back due to unsavory flavor and it came with just a few chunks of chicken. 5.  Stuffed Chicken Tortillas, 2 stars.  Lacked flavor, was forgettable. 6.  Chicken Madeira, 5 stars.  Chicken was soft and flavorful.  It has plate licking qualities. 7.  Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane, 5 stars.  I already described the mouth watering chicken.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was satisfying to the palate.   8.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, 5 stars.  Big enough for two to share. 9.  Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, 3 stars.  Big enough for two but too rich for my taste buds. I was a little surprised that, for the prices they charge, a soup or salad was not included with our main course meals, 2 stars.  If you are going to charge these prices, you should be providing more.  A basic bottle of The Cheesecake Beringer wine was $32. No one was overwhelmingly impressed with this dining experience.  I'm glad we tried it, but probably will not return.  Too many unsatisfied taste buds to justify a return visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140
Joseph L.,"Fairfield, CT",53,98,169,4.0,8/20/2014,"Keeping in mind that this location is brand new and just opened up for less than a month, they're still working out some kinks.  I've always been a big Cheesecake Factory fan, which is why I wasn't surprised that this place was completely packed Sunday night.  If you are going in with a party of 2 it shouldn't be too bad, my wife and I waited for about 30 minutes but I like the fact that they have text message system rather than the little vibrating sensors that let you know your table's ready.  It allows you to go further away from the restaurant and shop the mall while you wait and not miss the alert.  Bigger parties, you'll probably be waiting an hour or more depending on what time you go.   After reading the few reviews posted so far I was trying to keep my expectations in check and not being over hyped.  We had 2 waitresses attending our table which was great, probably 1 in training.  Joclyn was very professional and attentive.  We got our drinks and bread quickly and the bread was very fresh and still warm. We ordered the Fire Cracker Salmon Rolls for appetizer which came out at a reasonable pace.  For entrees we had 2 different pastas, both arrived at the same time and still very hot and fresh.  I was also surprised that they were seasoned very well and portion size was excellent as usual with Cheesecake Factory.   I couldn't say the same for the table next to us, they had some issues with their order (too much cheese on their pizza... wth?)  Anyway, we also got the banana cream cheese cake which was very smooth and delish.  Overall, we had an excellent experience this time and I hope it'll continue the next time we return.  I was happy with the service we received from Joclyn and no complaints about the food despite the other reviews and our neighboring table.   There can be room for improvement at the entrance as it gets pretty crazy crowded during times and confusion occurs as some people picking up take out or just buying cheese cake get all mingled with the other restaurant guests waiting for tables. The front end people seemed kind of stressed as they don't really smile or act alert when guests try to get their attention, but I assume their just really trying to focus on seating everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140

Robin B.,"Shelton, CT",2,25,,1.0,5/22/2015,"The portions are big yet the food is so-so at best.   My husband had a Mexican dish that he barely touched (he never leaves food on his plate), my son who eats us out of house and home left his eggplant parm on his plate, my gumbo was definitely not the kind you would find in any New Orleans restaurant, and the deep-fried macaroni and cheese landed in the stomach like a lead balloon.  The cheesecake doesn't make the rest of the meal any more worth eating.  No, this is no longer on our list of places to eat out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-trumbull?start=140
