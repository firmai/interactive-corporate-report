0,Amanda B.,"Fort Benning, GA",179,71,83.0,3.0,2016-10-12,Meh.... In past visits the staff is super friendly and attentive but this time our server seemed oblivious. He was pretty slow on things. The food was good but the desert we got was stale and you could taste it. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since this is the first time anything bad has happened.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-32,,,,,
2,Bill J.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,1.0,2016-10-19,"This is a great new building,  upstairs and downstairs patio.   The Applebees should close down and let a restaurant open here that wants to provide good service and bring in customers.  The staff and service are horrible,  especially at night.   Take an extra couple if minutes and drive to ANY other restaurant,  it will be worth avoiding this sad place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-32,,,,,
1,Terrance C.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,17,,1.0,2017-06-07,"This place was a shit hole! The serves were rude and sucked at their job. Management was ignorant, and uncaring. I was so excited when I pulled out of Target across the street on 6/5/17 and saw this place closed down. If anyone who used to work there is reading this.....FUCK YOU!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-albuquerque-32,,,,,
