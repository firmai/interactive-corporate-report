John M.,"Dallas, OR",2,10,,2.0,9/1/2014,"The""perfect margarita"" was watery and far from perfect.  My chicken and portobello mushrooms was dry and the lettuce in my wife's Thai shrimp salad fell off the produce truck sometime last week.  We often eat at Applebee's when we are on the road and this particular one does not measure up to others in the franchise.  Mediocre at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3?start=40
Alexis D.,"South Jordan, UT",108,21,2,3.0,8/13/2012,"The waitress and hostess were very kind, and it wasn't too busy on a Sunday night. Drinks came promptly and our food did not take too long. Food wasn't cold like other reviewers stated and it was all done how we asked. My only problem was that the food seemed to be covered in pepper. My french fries were completely coated in salt and pepper which was kind of gross.  I got the chicken wrap and it wasn't too spicy, but some bites were.  Someone in my party got the shrimp salad and her shrimp were covered in pepper as well.  It made it almost too spicy for her.  Overall the food was okay, just way too much salt and pepper.  It feels like they are trying to flavor things with it. Next time I think I will order a salad or something to avoid this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3?start=40
Lady G.,"Bothell, WA",2,30,3,1.0,1/21/2012,"I've occasionally chosen Applebee's in various places because it was a known quantity.  If I wasn't feeling very adventurous, it was a place to go.  But, after eating at this one, I can't bring myself to go there again *anywhere*.  Even for an Applebee's, this place is horrible -- way worse than any other I've been to.  The food is cold when it comes out, and the service is slow and generally bad.  The food itself is poorly made, even for what it is.  Still, both times my husband and I went, the place was inexplicably packed, so everything was incredibly slow.  It was just a terrible experience all around.

Alison Y.,"Calgary, Canada",13,92,17,1.0,4/9/2012,"I've been to applebee's a few times over the last 6 years...they went from great service and food to mediocre at best. Between burned burgers and iffy service on one trip, to this time we had a 5 minute wait for 2 measly vinegar packets, a server who would walk away after delivering our food so we had to wait 5 minutes just to ask for the vinegar in the first place, fish-stick tasting fish and chips that was supposed to be cod....on top of that when we first arrived the hostess asked whether we'd want the lounge or the dinning area, we said we'd like booths in the dinning area and for five minutes we ended up arguing with her (politely of course because she was being very pushy) about not wanting to go to the lounge. She pushed the lounge to the point where we ended up with a table that was half-booth and half chairs in the lounge, but if you're going to ask where you want to be seated you should NEVER push the area that's the opposite of the customer's answer. I don't know what she was thinking.

They have a pretty good happy hour special that begins at 9pm til close.  The appetizers (most of them) are half-off and the drink specials vary.   But like any chain restaurant, or any dining place, there's just many factors that contribute to how well your experience is.  On average, the good is good and the service is quick... but I always depend on who's with me to top off the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3?start=40

This place is classic American and has earned it's reputation as the ""Neighborhood Bar and Grill."" We walked in expecting an ordinary dining experience until we were seated in Amanda's section. She takes the average fare, and kicks it up a notch to make the Bee's a really fun place to hang out, have a beer (they serve Boundary Bay) and get some good grub.

Lee R.,"Bellingham, WA",3,6,,3.0,6/28/2017,We have had many enjoyable visits through the years at Applebee's.  Tonight was our first real disappointment.  The deep fried chicken appetizer's were rock hard.  We had them split our dinner order of Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken and it was lukewarm and the chicken not completely cooked.  We ordered a salad that came five minutes after our dinner so we sent it back.   We had three different servers which may have caused some of the issues.  The servers and door greeter were very friendly and respectful.  The person hustling people outside at the Alex Lemonade Stand was friendly but to aggresive.  After a customer declined to donate she snapped back that didn't they know it was for children with cancer.  She did not respect the customers space and made others standing nearby uncomfortable.  We had already donated to her but wished we hadn't after that exchange.  Oh well  Life goes on and we will return and know things will be better next visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3?start=20
Scott B.,"Lynden, WA",0,68,5,3.0,3/1/2016,We frequent here quite a bit because we can always get in around 9 to 10 PM and the appetizers are half price. You would not want to pay full price for any of the appetizers because the portions lately are horrible. They keep changing The appetizer menu and not for the better. I wish they would go back to their old menu a year ago. They had large portions especially their quesadillas. They also used to have really good nachos. They tried to go fancy with their hors d'oeuvres and failed miserably. Ever since they took all the fun stuff off the walls they have gone downhill. I have been coming here less and less over the last year and before long I guess I won't be back. They need a serious management adjustment to get back to their winning ways.

I was in Bellingham on business and when I'm traveling for business everything goes on the Amex card. Needless to say this can greatly reduce restaurant choices especially when I'm out of the major metropolitan areas.  Knowing they would take Amex I went to the Applebee's in Bellingham and the food was not horrible. Still what I consider to be under par for the price but better than my last few times at this chain. I must say that the service at this Applebee's was probably the best I've had at this chain. Very good service, friendly attentive waitress. Food was delivered fast and hot.

Rebecca P.,"Bellingham, WA",2,17,,1.0,10/5/2015,"I went to Applebee's on Sunset today with my grandfather (who has severe alzheimer's) and my grandmother. Our server was an older gentlemen maybe in his late 40s early 50s who was very pleasant and was a wonderful sever. Our meal came to about $32 with their senior discount and the food overall was a lot better than I remember in the past. As I mentioned my grandfather has SEVERE alzheimer's and it is hard enough taking him places anyways. He lives in the past when 50 cents was a LARGE tip. Whenever we go out to dinner it's a huge fiasco when we pay for the meal and my grandfather will argue until he's blue in the face about leaving a tip and has even gone to the extend of going back to the table as we are leaving to take more money away from the server. My grandmother and I have made it a habit to let him leave a small tip and as we walk out we tip the server more so it doesn't cause a scene. At the end while paying for our $32 meal my grandfather left a $3 tip which in my opinion is insulting  (I've worked in this industry but i NEVER expected anything from anyone knowing how hard times can come up). I had 7 more dollars in my hand to hand to the sever because he was great. As the serve took the money I watched him walk to the register, shake his head, sort of hit his hand down and legitimately through and fit. He looked absolutely on fire....! He wouldn't even look at me when i was trying to get his attention. It was very uncomfortable. I immediately put my money back in my pocket. I get that a small tip can be irritating. I've been there. But to choose this job with the odds of an elderly person giving a small tip and then to visually throw a fit like that was discusting to watch. I will never step foot in a Applebee's again. I hope this server and his manager reads this.. this event has truly bothered me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3?start=20

The wait staff can either be nice or mean but I notice when it is really busy they are usually cranky because they are very busy. It can be a long wait for a table but even when you're seated you still have to wait for them to take your order. Depending on the time of day this can take a while. Portions are small and its well known that they microwave most of their food.

First, the menu has changed dramatically - there's only 1 pasta dish, only 4 burgers, and many other things are really limited or completely gone.  The waiter told us they were getting another new menu in about a week. I ordered their burger with a fried egg and hashbrowns which I didn't want but didn't see anything else I did.  The waiter said if I didn't like it, he'd get something else for me at no charge.  My husband ordered a plain burger. My burger arrived and looked pretty pink after I cut it in half.  I ate a couple bites then saw that the entire middle was raw.  I told the waiter who had the manager come over and she offered to get me anything else.  We were trying to get to a family engagement/service so I asked for chicken fingers thinking they would be easy and fast to cook.  They were, but they didn't taste good.   The waiter comped both entrees for us because of this.

My family and I love dining with Applebee's, and their multiple locations. They have always met my expectations and held their reputation.   Our location here has me scratching my head. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by our host in a timely manner. The restaurant was slightly less occupied than expected, so were we happy to be brought to our table in just a short while.  Brandon, our server was a younger waiter, friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered our drinks and appetizer, chips and salsa. The kitchen was out of apple juice for the kids, so they enjoyed chocolate milk instead. I had hot chamomile tea, and hubby had a water. Our appetizer, arrived with warm tortilla chips and what tasted like a jar of store bought salsa. This was clearly NOT made in house. It was thick and dry. Not what we remember this dish to taste like. Hubby and I ordered from the 2/$26 menu. Mine, was the meat and potatoes, that tasted alright. The potatoes tasted real fresh, the fried onions were crunchy and the beef was cooked through. Hubby's dish tasted ok too. However, our daughter's kids meal, chicken strips and mozzarella sticks, were completely inedible, that she refused to eat them. I thought they tasted like frozen, store bought cheese sticks, and over cooked/fried chicken. Our other kid's meal was two sliders and applesauce. It arrived as a small patty stuffed in an oversized bread roll and cut in half.  I usually don't criticize the ambiance and loudness of other dining guests, but because we were seated next to the bar area with only a short divider, we were able to hear their conversations!  It was a bit too loud.

It's in the garbage.  Even the fries were chewy. The green beans, on the other hand were absolutely delicious, but so over cooked that I didn't need to chew.

Normally we'd go to Shari's for a meal but it was closed for renovations so we decided try Applebees. The menu isn't out of ordinary. It's your burgers, steaks, salads - etc. I had a pasta dish with grilled chicken. It wasn't bad. I didn't care for the balsamic vinegar mixed with tomatoes the used as a garnish. Each table is equipped with a portable tablet. It's used to call your server, play games, place your order, see the specials and pay for your meal. I'm not a fan of this gizmo.  To be honest it's not hygienic. I never saw anyone wiping them down. Use them if you dare. My tip: if there are two if you dining it's best to turn to the back of the menu. There you will find dinners for two $25. You get an appetizer and two main dish. What a deal!

Jan B.,"Bellingham, WA",29,172,28,4.0,3/20/2017,"Hadn't been here for a couple of years.  They have new menu with many pages of selections...almost overwhelming.  We were here on prime time Friday evening and the place was nearly empty.  I like the ""light"" section of their menu.  Many tasty, healthy, low calorie options.  I had the spicy Thai shrimp salad.  It was huge and very good!  My partner had the salmon with sweet potatoes.  Very generous portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3
Olga K.,"Bellingham, WA",342,13,17,3.0,4/18/2016,"Quality of food: I could be wrong but it tastes and looks as if it's just microwaved frozen food. I've tasted and prepared enough food to distinguish a huge difference between the two. This is why I usually  pass up the meals and meats and just stick with appetizers. Soft pretzels are choice.  Service: No complaints. Always greeted warmly and seated promptly. There is one young lady that stands out, she only greets and seats people I believe. I didn't catch her name. She is full of energy and always looks as if it's just the best day of her life. That is a very rare kind. My respect.  Couple more things Id like to add. The seating is great. Plenty of booths (my favorite), and subtle lighting, gives it a comfortable warm atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3

Alexandra R.,"Bellingham, WA",72,9,3,1.0,5/3/2017,"We used to dine regularly at Applebee's. This Applebee's provides terrible customer service. We've tried giving them a second chance and it was just as bad. A bunch of ditsy, inattentive teenagers running the place. We even did the survey and explained our bad experience but got no response and no one attempted to rectify the situation. We will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3
Leena K.,"Bellingham, WA",262,8,2,1.0,6/8/2017,I don't know why we continue to go back and try again. I ordered the steak and shrimp. I got my steak and broccoli but the waitress messed up my order so they were cooking the shrimp right away for me. I was pretty much done with the rest of my food when the shrimp arrived. It was seriously raw and covered with whatever they were supposed to cook it with to the point it was a big puddle on the plate. Trying to get the attention of the waitress was pointless. She finally came and asked if I wanted something else. No thank you. They did give me $5 off my meal... But who can't cook shrimp?  My husbands meal wasn't very good either. Food came inconsistent temperatures. Macaroni and cheese was disgusting. Not cheesy (or warm) at all. I will try to remember to never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3
Danielle K.,"Vancouver, Canada",111,185,444,3.0,12/7/2015,"I've been to this Applebee's countless times before, and I must say one thing: the food quality here is quite variable. Sometimes you get really delicious & well-prepared dishes, but other times the dishes come out tasting pretty bad.  On our most recent visit, we stopped in for a late dinner (around 9ish pm). We had the ""2 for $20"" special - an appetizer to share, and 2 entrées.  The appetizer we chose was the mozzarella sticks. Sadly it was not really well-prepared this time, with the cheese being kinda hard instead of soft & gooey (we have had this here before). I would probably go with the boneless wings next time around, as I've found that they don't seem to mess up on that dish as much.  The entrées we chose this time were the chicken tenders & the cedar grilled lemon chicken. The chicken tenders were pretty hard and overcooked. Lots of breaded crust & not much actual chicken meat. The fries were alright. The cedar grilled lemon chicken, on the other hand, was pretty good. It was served with tasty basmati rice, and topped with cubed green apple bits.  They offer a different selection of dishes in the ""2 for $25"" special, of which I've tried and liked the double crunch shrimp, and the mac & cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders. Service is generally OK here. They also have a tablet (at each table) from which you can order, call for your server, or play games. All games are locked behind a pay wall. I believe it was $1.99 per play? Not too sure of the pricing as the selection of games didn't really interest me. All in, decent value for the food & service you get, with a nice small town family restaurant ambience. Will probably be back again when I'm next in the neighbourhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114,3.0,3/22/2015,"The food quality here is consistent, it is fresh and full of flavor. I enjoy there new pick your own appetizer meal- it allows for a good selection of small bites at a decent price. The new table tablet that allows you to order drink refills on demand and pay your bill with an email copy of the receipt is a great addition.  The lack of a stars comes from that service can be hit or miss- it is never bad- but there are very clearly employees here who just don't care. There is one associate who I had who was great- the other ones (bar area) just do not seem to care in the afternoons about their guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3
Chris K.,"Bellevue, WA",98,10,,3.0,3/7/2017,Been here multiple times and every time we either seat ourselves or wait for minutes with no host... And it's not busy.  Wait staff is under par on the smile points... What helps is that the food is pretty good compared to other Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3
Ron W.,"Ferndale, WA",0,87,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Stopped here this afternoon for a late lunch (3:30pm) Seated right away. Only a few other customers in the restaurant. Waitress came and asked if we wanted drinks. Ordered a beer and coffee. A few minutes later here comes the drinks. At that point we placed our order. After ten minutes our drinks were empty and no waitress in sight. I decided to push the ""call server"" button at the table. After five more minutes here comes the waitress. I ask for more drinks. Five minutes later she returns with my beer, but the coffee? ""Sorry, we have to make another pot, so it will be a bit"" WTF? Shouldn't your first clue to make more be when your customer orders the first cup? Food was cold and way too expensive. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3
Stephanie T.,"Richmond, Canada",85,152,2791,4.0,4/27/2014,"My friend and I decided to stop by on our same-day states trip as we wanted something reasonably priced and I had never tried it before. I've heard of this chain restaurant so I had respective expectations for it. They had a $20 deal going on and that was very attractive to us.  We got there around 6:30 pm and was promptly seated, no reservations necessary (this was a Saturday). It was quite busy but not 100% full. Our waitress was very friendly and patient - no attitude. She could have been a little faster when stopping by for drinks, taking our orders, etc but I guess she had a lot of tables to look after. Still we had no complaints about her service - very personable and conversational. This restaurant had free wifi, which was very slow so I barely bothered with it.  The $20 deal comes with one appetizer and two entrees for two people. Awesome price compared to regular menu price which is already reasonably priced.  Boneless wings, honey BBQ flavour with ranch dip, $9.49 normally: these were breaded chicken breast chunks with a BBQ sauce on them with a dip and celery sticks on the side. I loved these but would have preferred less BBQ sauce. However these were still great - I ate these so fast! Citrus lime 7 oz sirloin, $13.49 normally: I got this medium rare. It came with a plastic stick on the top. The server said this just meant how well it was cooked for the kitchen's benefit, I guess. It came with potatoes that are like breakfast ones, and a side of vegetables (zucchini and beans). I didn't like the potatoes but my friend loved them. The vegetables were good as they wer covered in the same sauce as the steak, which was cooked perfectly by the way. Sauce was so good but a little salty. I was very thirsty after this meal.  My friend got the riblet basket with fries, normally $9.49 I think. This was a huge portion, many rib things and fries. I was not aware of this kind of rib. They had bones throughout and less meat. The sauce was same as the boneless wings. The fries were good. He couldn't finish though as it got boring.  For a chain restaurant, I had a great time. The food was good enough, the service was great, and overall an awesome experience. I left in a really great mood. I don't see why there are so many poor reviews. It's nothing fancy and you can't compare it to something like that. The food came hot and our waitress was nice.  In the future, I would definitely go for the $20 deal again. I would also like to try their happy hour - half prices appetizers from 3-6 and 9pm to close! Also there's a free appetizer if you join their perks thing. Yay :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-bellingham-3
Bob E.,"Blaine, WA",0,10,,5.0,7/8/2017,"The wife and I for a change ordered the same item from the menu, it was a chicken and shrimp dish that was cooked to perfection, very tasty and well priced.

Niki A.,"Boulder, CO",71,1,,1.0,12/22/2016,My husband and I come in here periodically.
