Danielle I.,"Dayton, OH",50,40,2,3.0,9/5/2017,Bring a sweater its chilly inside. Friendly staff but my steak was cooked wrong twice,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Chris P.,"Loveland, OH",0,30,1,2.0,10/12/2017,"Stopped here for lunch.  Staff must be hard of hearing because the music was very loud.  My server had to repeat herself every time because I didn't even hear her speak when she walked up.  It was 80's music with back-to-back David Bowie, so at least I could relive my teenage years.  However, I don't think I used to listen to it at that volume.  If the volume was meant to force the customers to eat fast and get out, then they have solved that challenge.  Food was ok.   Service was fine - it wasn't her fault nobody could hear her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Gina M.,"Bolivar, OH",1,7,,1.0,10/21/2017,The reason for one stars is because I like Applebee's and have never had a problem with it before until this location. First our waitress took 15 minutes to get to us. She said she did not know she had our table.  She did apologize but here is the problem she never asked what sides I wanted plus she never brought our food. She basically dropped our drinks off and did not come back until after our food was served. She made it to other tables several times and they were people who were seated after us. Very poor service.  Will not come back to this location. Not very good when you have people who are from out of town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Cassi S.,"Hamilton, OH",11,11,,4.0,9/27/2017,"I had a date here the night before last. The date went well, if you are curious. But, more importantly, the waitress was fantastic. I didn't get her name, because I got there after my dare already had a table and a beer. I got some chips and salsa and an Oktoberfest. The beer was great. The reason for one missing star is that about half of my chips were stale. Otherwise, everything was great. I didn't mention the chips, because it was a date and I just sucked it up. I have no doubt that i would have gotten new one if I had asked for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Jenni H.,"Milford, OH",26,250,21,3.0,10/10/2015,"uhh, yeaah, I gave it 3 stars....I mean it's an Applebees.  There's not much more to explain than that.  Service was very slow and I felt we had to keep calling the waitress over for things like.......plates.....forks.........napkins, lol.  Yea, really.   But the food was solid",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Sandy C.,"Fairfield, OH",1,14,1,3.0,11/17/2016,Seated right away and waitress came and took our order. My knife was dirty and I asked for clean one. Waitress was very good. I had oriental salad  which was way to much to eat. My husband had the 6 oz. Top sirloin which he said was tougjh,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Missy S.,"Erwin, TN",4,1,,1.0,6/21/2016,They need to hire people who want to work. Slowest non service ever. Will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
josh m.,"Middletown, OH",12,31,1,1.0,6/4/2016,Well I'll give the food a 4 star but the waitress I had is awful.  I had to go get my own refills.  As long as I always a drink I'll be happy.  This location was almost empty when we walked in and we still had the slowest service. The entire time I was here all the waitresses hung around the bar and then a table near the bar my entire visit.  Because of poor customer service I have to rate this experience and location a 1.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Jennifer T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",35,10,2,3.0,5/18/2015,Pretty average Applebee's everyone was nice. I ordered the Mushrooms burger with a side salad instead of fries. The burger was good but messy and i had to scrap off some unidentifiable sauce that i don't remember reading in the details.  They brought my salad out first which is wired done I indicated it was to replace my fires but that's just nitpicking i guess over all good experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Valerie M.,"Piqua, OH",75,98,16,5.0,3/23/2015,Friendliest Applebee's I've been in a long time  Food is great and customer service makes this a great stop,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Ashley T.,"Franklin, OH",6,25,4,5.0,4/18/2014,"Okay, confession corner. I have stubbornly avoided Applebee's like the plague for years and years... at this point I can't even remember why.  I sort of feel obligated to write this after all the horrible reviews I just read on it...I'm thanking my lucky stars I didn't read those BEFORE we went...we'd have never gone! So, here's the quick and dirty...My boyfriend and I live 5 minutes from one of your locations, and decided to give it a go tonight (on Good Friday no less). Oh. My. Goodness. It was SO good! I am shocked on many levels - the atmosphere was fun, the service was great (so friendly!). The hostess actually greeted several people (regulars I assume) by their names.  We both had the 3 cheese penne with chicken, with the boneless wings to start (half honey bbq/half buffalo) and then finished with the chocolate explosion cake. The wings were HANDS DOWN the best I've had in a long time. Better than our favorites from BW3's. The cake. Oh my Lord, the cake. Worth every penny! I am sad I've been missing out for so long and sorry for my pseudo grudge ha Now we have a new excitement for living 5 minutes away! We will DEFINITELY be back. In summary, I think this location must have really stepped it up in the last few months, because even with being busy tonight, the place was very clean, the hostess was spot on with timing (we waited ~10 minutes). And our server was on the ball.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Garrett L.,"Dayton, OH",0,9,3,3.0,12/21/2015,Christina are waitress show outstanding service very polite and very attentive... The food has got a lot better and more faster..The only downfall was waiting for the check for about 20 mind and didn't see a manager go out doing table touches,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Matthew C.,"Lebanon, OH",15,99,102,5.0,6/14/2015,"Great Applebee's! I come here often and the staff of all friendly and great. The hostess Deb is awesome and so funny. Very fast most of the time and the food is always good, hot, and very tasty! Great for kids and larger groups so bring everyone and enjoy a great meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
K F.,"Germantown, OH",0,5,,5.0,4/22/2015,The best Applebee's in the area. Food is great Waitresses are on the spot and friendly. And it is clean,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Will B.,"Middletown, OH",0,28,6,1.0,4/6/2015,"I have had many experiences here, and most of them haven't been great.  I usually only go here because family do.  Their steaks are horrible and never made right thefist time.  Also when they do mess them up and get them back out to you, the people you are with are usually done.  I don't really care for the quality of their food and their customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  I have a family member who used to work here and my family likes to go quite a bit, but I don't think I'll be returning for food.  If I go back it'll be for a beer and appetizers, doubt I'll get an actual meal.  It's pretty hard to screw up appetizers, so I feel safe with that, and maybe dessert, other than that I wouldn't trust them to make a Hamburger Helper meal correctly.  Definitely NOT a place I recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Dane K.,"Lebanon, OH",4,20,2,2.0,8/30/2014,Not bad much better than the Middletown one. Still going with 2 stars. Fajitas were good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Marianne C.,"Butler, OH",42,168,50,4.0,6/8/2011,"I go here regularly, but I am not a regular.  The regular would be the guy you ALWAYS see in the baseball cap EVERYWHERE in town.  He also makes appearances at Fricker's, the Moose, etc.  Anyway, I'm writing this review, because although I have never really been a fan of Applebee's, I have gone more frequently lately and had a good time.   I am disappointed that they no longer carry UFC fights.  I'm tempted to only give three stars to the place because of that, but I'll be kind.   The staff are great.  I've always had good service here, and the people are friendly.  You see the same waitstaff, which is a good thing, because you become comfortable with the people greeting you, seating you, and serving you.  I'm always wary of a place with high employee turnover.  The beer selections are a bit sad, but I did have the Blue Moon seasonal last night, which was better than expected.   As for the food, I can't comment too much on it, but the bourbon chicken and shrimp is surprisingly good.  It sizzles when it comes out, so don't burn yourself.  I was a bit skeptical about it as a potential entree, but I was impressed.  I've had some of the appetizers, which are reasonable. Overall, this is a good neighborhood place.  You see the same people there, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your perspective.   If you're into the ""spot your local city official"" or ""spot your local former city official"" game, this is the place to be.  Ok, that's a really boring game.  Go for the cool staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Albert A.,"Middletown, OH",3,33,,2.0,9/19/2013,"I use to love this Applebee's; going at least once a week.  However, the energy in this restaurant has recently depleted and the last few times I have went, I have been less than satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Stephanie S.,"Millington, TN",183,41,101,2.0,8/13/2013,"I normally enjoy Applebee's, but this location was horrible. Dirty atmosphere, slow food, and over all not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Susan G.,"Middletown, OH",10,7,6,1.0,6/4/2011,"We used to enjoy this Applebee's location. But our recent trip there offered dirty floors and seating, no clean silverware available until partway through meal, and poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12
Bob R.,"Monroe, OH",0,1,,1.0,2/8/2014,"I get it, we went on a Saturday.  The hostess  told us 10-15 minutes.  After 20, I went up just to check in and trying to be as polite as I could (because I've been in the business and know how people can be).  The woman told me 20 minutes.  And then she said 20 per person.  Five minutes later a table became available.  She called a couple that had only been there for 10 minutes.  We left.  Lost 35 minutes of my life when my expectation was only 15. Thank you Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12?start=20
Jim S.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,22,,1.0,3/5/2013,Had three dirty plates out of five for appetizers. The waitress had to go through five more plates to find three additional clean plates. That means the dishwasher is batting .500.  Had to wipe food off the seat when we were seated too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-12?start=20
