I admit it, the crispers are the best thing on the menu but I hate to ask if the juicyness of the chicken breast is from the oil or not.  We'd come here all the time just for the crispers and give a 4 or 5 star rating but we'd also be 50 lbs heavier; hence we only come here when we have gift cards to use up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=420,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.412,2.48

Supposedly wanted to recommend something but did not... BS ALERT!   I was really unhappy with my ""trio sampler appetizer"" dish. Ordered sliders (meh, they were nothing special. Found it strange that the patties were connected to each other and the elements of it were generic), fried cheese (not cooked enough), and chicken crispers (beer-battered, not a good combo for chicken). Apparently there is another method that they cook the crispers, called ""Country style"", and the waitress described it as ""Basically like KFC-style."" NO GOOD ALREADY! For dessert, I ordered the molten chocolate cake. got to the middle and the chocolate was not even completely melted.  Not too bad, but could have been better.  That hot fudge is so good with the vanilla ice cream! Food took longer than average. Also I find it disappointing that there is no happy hour specials, yet they have a full bar and many specialty drinks (especially margaritas). Poo.   Bad service.... with a smile. GOOD POINTS: Their Classic Bacon Burger is really good!  Instead of getting Chicken Crispers, I recommend their wings (bone or boneless, no matta).  The sauce is spicy (7 on a scale of 1-10)!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=280,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.216,2.52

Your waitress was friendly, smart, and had cool hair.  Like. You have black bean burgers for those of us who do not eat meat.  Like. Your guacamole has large chunks of avocado.  By large chunks I mean a complete quarter avocado quietly lying in wait for the next chip victim.   Wafer thin chips + 3 inch avocado chunks = FUTILITY and DESPAIR.   I suggest you purchase thicker chips and also smash your guacamole with a fork.  Dislike.  (Dislike the despair part, not my super awesome suggestion.) The wait for our entrees took many, many valuable minutes from my life.  Time is money, so taking into consideration my extremely high hourly value that I place upon myself, forty minutes of wasted time is equivalent to at least 75 cents, possibly a whole dollar.  You owe me a dollar.  Dislike. My BBQ black bean burger was okay.  The fries were edible.  The molten chocolate cake was freakishly amazing.  Chocolatey and gooey and roll-your-eyes-back-better-than-sex deliciousness.  The best commercially produced cake that a person could ever have the pleasure of gluttonizing.  LIKE.   SIncerely, Angela",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=260,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.1879999999999997,2.64

I did like the nachos but feeling ill for a day straight is not acceptable. I shared the nachos yet the other person wasn't sick which is indeed interesting to say the least. I do know I have a weaker tolerance so anyone else who does should be aware of their food. Also, there was a kitten who was clearly stuck in a drain pipe on their property that they refused to set free. I'm guessing they did nothing later on and let it die since they had acted so inept and lazy about it. They also refused to call the security at the mall so we had to about the poor kitten.

Chili's had a coupon for $20 for two draft beers, unlimited fries, and two burgers.  We checked the coupon and it did NOT say anything about ""not valid in Hawaii.""  We went in on a Friday night and specifically asked if it was possible to use.  The host said sure no problem because nothing about Hawaii.  So we waited our time (30 minute wait) and when we got to our table, they tried to sit us down at a booth... but we have a baby so we needed a high chair.  They told us oh well, there's no room for a high chair but it's obvious we needed one so why sit us at another table?  Hello we stated this from the beginning.  FAIL!  Okay we got seated at the table and then asked the server to check on our coupon but he was like oh it's fine doesn't say not valid in Hawaii.  So after we order our beers, then the manager decides to tell us not valid in Hawaii.  Mind you it doesn't say such a thing.  ISNGIO:SNGOINS:GOINIO:n  That was my rargle fargle by the way.  Anyway, she comps us an appetizer and a dessert.  The sampler appetizer was decent.  However my entree was a different story.  I got some kind of wrap.  But HALF of the wrap fell out when they brought it to my table.  I told the waiter and he was like oh sorry.  SERIOUSLY?  UGH.  Why did I come here?  I didn't eat because it was horrible... I gave my husband a bite and he spat it out.  Dessert was okay but it doesn't change the fact that I am NEVER coming here AGAIN.  I promise!  It was SO bad... I can't believe they didn't take the coupon and the food was terrible.  The manager was really rude on top of which even if she comped our appetizer and dessert.  I would have just given the customer the coupon discount... because it doesn't say not valid in Hawaii.

Oh aaand that's an appetizer, I couldn't imagine how long we would have been there if we ordered regular entrees.

The food is good, though I always get almost the same things-or in rotating fashion; the honey chipotle crispers, the lunch combo, or the triple dippers.  Sometimes a drink or two (which back in the day made me HAAAAAPPPYY).  It's a laid-back kinda place. Overall, food is food when I'm hungry!  But the honey chipotle crispers are AWESOME (I've had preggo-like cravings for this a few years ago; and I've never even been preggos before so I don't know what it's really like).  It's nothing special to Hawaii, so what can I say?

It must have been the recent blue moon or something, because within the last 4 days I had gone to three different Chili's. The first one was Kahala, for lunch, with co-workers, the next was Mililani the very next night for dinner with family and the third time was at Waikele a couple days later for a senior dinner again with family. (senior dinner meaning around 4-ish). I usually like Kahala's location, bring seated right away with our party of 8. Our waitress was extemely friendly and accomodating.  Alot of us were deciding between the triple dipper and the lunch express.  With the triple dipper you can pick 3 different appetizers for one price, about $14, and  the lunch express, I believe was either soup salad and a sandwich, for about $11-12. I was surprised they had a lunch special that included the chicken fajita with a cup of soup for about $13, so I ordered that with a cup of the chicken tortilla soup.  Half way through our appetizers, one of co-workers let out a small gasp/scream.  She was drinking water and found a spider at the bottom of her cup, at the end of her straw.  EEeeeewww! We told another waitress who quickly apologized, took away the glass and replaced with another.  We were expecting the manager or at least acknowledgement from our waitress but nothing. As we were finishing our lunch... I also found an ant on my drinking water (outside not in...thank goodness!). Anyway, the manager came to our table afterwards and apologized AND comped my co-worker's lunch as well as my own.  Which helped since we also got dessert. Dessert is always good.   As for the other two locations.  Waitresses were also very friendly and eager to please, eventhough it was busy when we went.  The food is ok... Nothing to brag about or specifically go there for.  It is a good place to have appetizers and talk story.  It helps if you go during happy hour, since all appetizers are $2 off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=440,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.0920000000000005,2.6

NO POWER!!!  I texted the bestie and we decided on Chilis.  Thankfully Chilis had power.. This is probably the busiest I've ever seen them but for two I only waited 5 minutes.  After getting seated the server came by quickly for drinks.   The food:  She decided on Chicken cajun pasta.. I decided on the tripple dipper..  boneless buffalo wings, big bites (burger sliders) and spinach artichoke dip that comes with chips.   Everything was good.  The pasta is just as I remember it.  We even had lots to take home.   4 stars because it was a life saver.  It was only $30 for two of us which was a lot less that lunch the other day. ^_^v 31 yelps - 4/31",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=320,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.16,2.64

277,San M.,"Aiea, HI",0,8,2.0,1.0,2012-12-12,"This is tonight's back up place since the municipal lot in Kaimuki was packed. There were a lot of open tables when we got there, but we got placed at a two seat table.  Which means no fajitas for me. Sizzling plate+ plate with cheese, guacamole and sour cream+ rice and beans plate+ tortilla plate+ extra plate they give so you can build your fajita= craziness on the small table.  Not to mention 1/3 of the table was already covered with table condiments, menus and advertisements.  I placed some of these things on the divider rail.  Which actually was a plus because it blocked one of the blinding over head lamps from shining into my eyes.  They really need to dim the lights a little. Okay I understand when it is busy food takes a while to come out. It wasn't busy when we got there and it took more than 30 minutes from ordering before we got our food.  Our drinks were refilled quickly but just made us colder being that the place was empty so the room was on the colder side.  A basket for the rib bones was supposed to come but never showed up, oh well. I tried something different, Sweet & spicy chicken, it was on the low calories menu.  Honestly if I'm eating at Chili's I'm not there to eat healthy.  Sad thing is I used to like how they had butter on the broccoli.  I could do without the over saltiness of their food.  Tonight the salt level was okay.  Low calories just means a small portion, which they charge +$15 for... boggles my mind.   My chicken was burnt.  I basically ate my rice and broccoli.  I also took a piece of rib from K.K.'s plate. A manager paused at our table and asked if everything was okay.  I really dislike saying anything because it becomes a big deal even if I insisted that I am fine.  You asked so I answer 'my chicken is burnt but it's okay.'  Solution would be maybe you might tell your chefs not to burn the chicken anymore.  BUT instead of hearing that I am fine with the burnt chicken and K.K. will eat it,  and I'm just going to eat some of his food so I don't starve.  I get the oh want me to get you something else.  At which point I say we already waited 30 minutes for our food and we are on a time constraint.   They then tried to get me to take a complimentary dessert.  I cannot recall Chili's ever having a dessert worth trying.  Oh and I guess they don't recall I said we were running low on time since our food took 30 minutes. The check took a long time to process.  A tray came back to us with another tab and someone else's credit card which by the way was the wrong color, red instead of green.  It also had a female ID photo instead of a male photo.  I think we waited more than five minutes for the bill to be processed.  For a while there we thought they had lost the credit card and it was off in someone else's wallet.

Our waitress, a blonde woman... michelle I think, would give us half arsed apologies about the wait, yet never seemed to give a damn about us otherwise. I timed her leaving the floor on one occassion, 12 min to get a fruit punch and one plate of ribs. Are you kidding me!! We constantly ran low on water and I actually had to get up and walk to the host to ask for our check and takeout containers as our waitress disappeared once again. The food itself was pretty good. My burger was pretty good, and the rest of my family didnt have any real complaints for food quality aside from the ridiculous wait. I dont think I'll ever come back and encourage people to stay away from this nightmarish service. Sorry chilis' but you ruined your chance for my family and I.

What really amazed me was that another waitress from another section had to ask us if we were waiting for our food.  Yes, our waitress walked past our table 3 or 4 times completely ignoring us.  The MANAGER even walked past our table 3 times WITHOUT even noticing us waiting.   We did bring it to the manager's attention, and although she was very apologetic and did give us some $5 coupons, I will never go there again...Anyone want some $5 coupons so you can go eat cold crappy food and have terrible service?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=320,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.02,2.52

We were (especially me!) was very disappointed that there was NO applewood smoked bacon-just cheap bacon. I asked the waiter and he said that it's no longer available- for a month now. I told him (Kendi) that can't be since my husband and I had JUST had it last week-there & I had it last month at the Chili's Waikele. A mgr (I'm assuming she's a manager-did not introduce herself) came to our table. She stated the bacon has not been available for 2 months and the cooks did not know how to cook it correctly. What the..? I had already let the incident go...but Then another mgr came to our table and stated that it hasn't been available for 6 months. WHAT?! He too did not introduce himself. We've been going to Chili's Kahala since it first opened. And the menu has been updated and HAS the Applewood bacon. $14 hamburger! Extemely disappointed with no applewood bacon and the LIES! There's been other problematic time, but this took the cake-with the lies. My lemons was served in a plastic cup cap cover and Kendi the waiter states that the dishes were being washed. WTF?

305,Mateo R.,"Honolulu, HI",73,6,13.0,1.0,2013-02-09,"I went to Chilis to celebrate my birthday with my friends. My girlfriend called in advanced to ask about a reservation, they don't take any so we just said we would arriving at around 7pm. We arrived 10 minutes late due to the bus and traffic. Upon our arrival  we were greeted by who seemed to be the manager on duty, we told her we called in advanced that we needed a table for 8 and she rudely comments, ""We gave your table away, we didn't think you were coming.""  So far not so good, so we wait 10 minutes to be seated.      We arrive to our table and our waiter comes over takes our drink order. Since it was in celebration of my 21st birthday I was curious about the drink menu, I asked what the price of each drink was and he would just give me the run around and avoid answering my question. He kept playing with his long hair and seemed unfocused.       I finally decided on what drink I wanted and we all ordered our food. We waited about 10 more minutes for appetizers to come out. We ordered the loaded potato skins, regular nachos, and sweet potato fries. The food was bland, the skins had a rubbery consistency and it lacked flavor. The nachos were terrible, they are individually prepared, they had: chili, cheese, and olives. We got a total of 8 individual chips. All you can taste is cheese and grease. This was definitely not worth the price. The Sweet potato fries were descent can't really complain about fires.      We all ordered a steak entree, It was pretty bad.  The steak was dry, not charred at all, and looked like plastic. Truly.  It looked like something that would come out of a Fisher-Price plastic kitchen set.  It was low on flavor, which may not be a surprise for places such as Chilis, but the standard was so low that even taco-bell steak looks and tastes better. It was very disappointing for $17.       The server and manager did redeem themselves a little bit, all of our entrees were supposed to come with broccoli. They both came and apologized that the last batch of broccoli was bad so they didn't serve it to us. All the orders but one made it out to our table. We were missing one whole steak combo plate. We told the waiter to cancel the order since it was never sent out to us.       Since this was in celebration for my birthday, the waiter came out with a bowl of ice cream for me. I had a lit candle; It was a nice gesture but the ice cream was already half melted, so it was more of an Ice cream soup.       Overall it was a terrible first time experience, I will not be going back to Chilis. They lost a customer for good.                                              How to get here from UH Manoa      If you're feeling lazy take the 13 bus that picks up in front of Frear Hall and get off on the corner near The Fat Greek.

265,Jeffrey T.,"Hilo, HI",75,39,3.0,3.0,2013-02-12,"Went to Chili's with some friends around peak dinner time and we were seated immediately.  This is saying something, considering the wait at the nearby CPK was around 45 min to an hour, and basically sums up Chili's reputation as being the ""second"" choice for eating in and around Kahala Mall when Kuru Kuru Sushi and CPK are both full. The main problem with the restaurant is that the service staff is completely disorganized.  I feel like this is why the waitress will often say there are two of them taking care of your table, simply because you won't see one of them for the rest of the night as another one shifts over to take care of requests.  At one point my friend got two more ranch dips than she requested because they both fulfilled the request.  It's not a bad thing, but this problem can definitely impact you in a negative way. I'm a fan of their BBQ chicken and it did not disappoint me when it came in the triple dippers fashion.  I've never had an issue with the food at Chili's save for some of their burgers being overdone, but it is just the service that concerns me. At the end of our meal, it took the waitress a good 15 minutes to come by again despite the fact she said there would be two of them taking care of us.  We didn't even see her in our side of the restaurant for a majority of the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=340,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.476,2.36

I ordered their new Mango Chile Chicken which is a grilled chicken breast topped with a mango/tomato/avocado salsa that was a bit tangy, zesty, and slightly spicy. It came with steamed broccoli and rice. This dish was amazing and I wanted seconds! The only bad thing was the portion size. The chicken breast was a tad small compared to the rest of the plate. My friend ordered the Margarita Chicken which was very flavorful and came with marinated chicken breast on top of rice and beans. Honestly, his dish of food (and the chicken itself) was bigger than mine and his dish was a little over a $1 LESS than mine! For dessert, we just had to get the molten chocolate cake after seeing another table getting it. This is simply the most amazing dessert you'll ever have. It's basically chocolate cake (without the frosting) topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped up with drizzles of hot chocolate syrup that dries and becames a chocolate crust around the ice cream.

The service was OK although it took a while for our food and it wasn't even busy. But the server made up for it by explaining it was the cooks fault for trying to over cook our steaks. She told us she tried to tell him to not over cook the steaks. She even waited for us to cut our steaks to make sure it was medium rare. She went far beyond what I expected.  Being a cook I get up set when my steaks are not cooked the way I like it LOL. But she did a good job to try and make us Happy. She even gave us a bag of chips and salsa to go when all I asked for was a box for the left over chips I didn't eat. I would have been Happy with the left over chips and salsa.

Anyways, considering this isn't my first time here, this place has yet to disappoint me (knock on wood); although, I hope it doesn't plan on doing so in the near future. Some of my go to favorites have been the Sliders (complete with this ranch jalapeno sauce which goes good with the fries), and most recently, their Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers, which I will elaborate in just a moment.   For $14-$15 it is worth the money. There's no small helpings here. My plate came with 5 or 6 chicken pieces with ranch sauce you can dip the chicken in, seasoned corn on the cob (the trick is to use the knife to cut off the kernels so you spare your teeth some stuck corn), and french fries. Definitely is my new favorite. The fries compliment the Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers perfectly since it can have a spicy kick to it, but tanginess and sweetness that the sauce provides. The chicken crispers is still pretty crispy considering being under siege of the honey chipotle sauce, which in itself is pretty amazing! Everything on the plate seemed to work well, and all the flavors went well.  My mom's favorite is the sampler, she got three different things, which were the Southwestern Eggroll, Spinach Artichoke Dip (reminds me of CPK, but richer), and the Sliders (those good ol' sliders!)  One more thing to note was that I was able to score a free flatbread pizza, something that is new on their menu. I had signed up on Chili's to receive emails and alerts, and got an email for a free flatbread. Fast forward to today, I was able to use it, and it wasn't some lame portion like the small portions at CPK that you can get for free, it was the FULL portion. We ended up choosing the California Grilled Chicken Flat Bread Pizza, complete with all the bells and whistles: tomatoes, chicken, cilantro, bacon, and ranch dressing drizzled over, can't forget the avocado wedges! All atop a thin crunchy crust. SO GOOD. Really gives competition to CPK and for a cheaper price ($10.99 for this sucker).  Didn't had room for dessert today, shame on me. However I have always had the Molten Chocolate Lava Cake Ala Mode every time we grab dessert here. So good! I also heard the Chocolate Chip Cookie Ala Mode was something to try as well.

The hostess was REALLY friendly, i don't think i've ever seen such a happy hostess lol.  I ordered their bottomless mango tea, VERY GOOD! I really like their tea! Probably the only good thing.  I ordered the lean sirloin with broccoli and side mac & cheese. Wow. The portions were so tiny. For $16 it wasn't that much at all. My mac & cheese was also COLD! :( I told the server and she got me another one pretty quickly. After eating everything I wasn't full at all. At $25 I should definitely be full.

296,Gary M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,1.0,1.0,2013-07-15,"Wish I would have read the reviews before I set out across town to come here. First I called to ask about the birthday email club. It wouldn't let me print out the coupon for the free desert so I called in advance to make sure they would do the birthday thing and not mess it up. So I get to the restaurant and get seated. The server came over and did not seem to be in a good mood, just what I love when I go out to enjoy a meal.  I tried to joke with him about getting two appetizers since I had two coupons; he was in no mood for that so that set the bar for our evening. I also told him that it was my fiancées birthday and let him know about the call I made earlier to the manager about it. We ordered and waited for our appetizers. The server came over and apologized that it was taking so long to bring out the apps and that it would be out soon.  After about 20 min or so they finally came out and he apologized again for it taking so long.  They actually tasted pretty good, they were some type of chips and but having the server as dry as he was and it feeling like we were bothering him being there made the experience less than pleasant, especially since I drove from Liliha to go there for my fiancées birthday. Then after another 15 min or so the main entrees came out. This is where it started really sucking. I ordered the ribs and fries and started to eat. The fries were dry and semi-warm, not hot and fresh but dry and semi-warm. The ribs were a little tough and also semi-warm. It was apparent that they held the meal because the appetizer took too long and they didn't want them both out together.  My fiancée had the chipotle chicken strips and she had the same experience with it not being hot, same with the fries warm and dry. As we were still eating I asked the server for a to-go box. The box came out and so did the bill and they started cleaning up right away to get us out of there. I was waiting for the birthday song and nothing. How nice of them to forget why we drove all the way there, FOR HER BIRTHDAY! So I mention to another server what happened and still nothing for another 7-8 minutes so I had to ask, again, my server for the birthday perk. After another 10 minutes I finally hear them coming. After they did their stint they dispersed quickly and without even giving us a spoon for the desert. Had to wait and find the server again. All in all it was a very unpleasant experience, the only good part was that I was with the one that I loved on her birthday and because of that I was not going to be in a foul mood! Save yourselves the hassle and frustration and avoid this location at all costs, I know we and our friends will not be coming back here anytime soon! Thanks!

I met my dear mommy for dinner before a movie around 8PM. We were seated right away in the bar area (not ideal for non-drunken convos, but eh) and the waitress promptly came up to ask us for our drink order. I checked in on Foursquare (uh oh, are they going to kick me off of Yelp for the ultimate betrayal?!) and noticed that there was an offer for free bottomless chips and salsa. The waitress was super accommodating and didn't need to ""ask the manager"" about the offer or anything (ahem, Outback, I'm looking at you!). We ordered the rest of the food and it came decently quickly (love the low-calorie section). We never once had to ask for drink refills, and everything was prompt and orderly.  Normally, I'm just MEH about chain restaurants, but Chili's was an exceptional experience, thanks to the wonderful waitress.

Totally not his fault that the kitchen at this location SUCKS. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a foodie, so Chilis is really just an option if nothing else is open. But Boyfriend loves their chicken crispers so we went to the Kahala location last night. First we were seated in the bar next to this very loud table of 5 extremely drunk people. They were super obnoxious so we asked to be moved. This is strike one for me because I feel especially at a family chain, they should know when to cut people off. Our server later told us that they had been there for two hours and had 14 shots each! Um overkill much? Anyways our server was this adorable young guy named James, and if it weren't for him we would honestly have walked out and not even paid. Now foodwise I should have known better than to order steak at Chilis but they had this deal for $12 and it came with a salad, 6oz steak, garlic bread, and sweet potato fries. Sold. Boyfriend got a salad and his chicken crispers. I specifically asked for no onions on my salad . Onions were present. Sigh. Also my salad were topped with cucumbers that had mold on them. Um...ew. My medium steak came out and it was almost blue rare. I could tell without even cutting it that it was raw inside. I asked for it to be medium and my server took it away with many apologies. Nice kid. It comes back...same piece of steak (I could tell from where I cut it) only now it is officially dead. I don't think I have ever had steak that was soooo well done. I choked on swallowing a piece. Now to be fair the manager did take it off the menu but I was pretty disgusted with the food at that point. And poor James looked like he knew he wasn't going to get tipped. But still acted like a champ! So friendly still and joked around with us. We ended up giving him a 30% tip cause we felt so bad, although his service really was excellent.  Overall worst food I have had in a long time. But go see James V!

It's more of a sports bar, with a dining room area. Or maybe it's because every time I go there, I get bomb ass service from mostly the same servers... But I don't go frequently cause I'm not rich enough to buy really good expensive food all the time, but I usually get the same servers.  And every time, I get awesome ones.  I don't know all their names... but there's this really tall guy, he towers over everyone, he is very nice. This nerdy guy is on it with his servicing. This really nice lady Jessica, she always wears pretty makeup and has nice dark brown/black hair. This one server Nicole, has a super nice smile and makes you feel welcome! There's so much more, but I can't remember everyone. Also, the Hostesses are always nice and greet whoever walks in.  And sometimes, if it's slow, they'll even open the door for you when you arrive AND depart! Now for the food. I know what to buy, but I don't know what not to buy... I'll list everything that is AMAZING in no specific order. Big mouth bites Egg rolls Chicken crispers Caujin pasta Flat bread pizza Nachos (only if you have that green thing to dip it in!) Mac n' Cheese (because everyone has a kid food they love!) Steak and cheese sandwich (this fills you up if you eat a lot and it comes with fries) Spinach and artichoke dip with chips (when eating this, use your fork to pick up the dip, and put it on your chip. Chilis chips are thin, but better for you if you're going to have a full meal!) Ribs (They're good by itself, but taste amazing with ranch sauce, trust me.) Everything off the low calorie menu is good for you and that's probably why it doesn't taste as good as everything else, but hey, why go to a sports bar & grill if you're not gonna pig out like a sports fan? Salad is salad.  It tastes the same everywhere. Their desert though. ;D Oh my Oh My!!!!!!

Once entering we were seated on the right side of the dinning area. A waitress came and took our drink and appetizer orders.  When we were almost done with our drinks and food, we wanted to order more drinks but was not sure how long happy hour was. So when we asked the waitress and she informed us that Happy Hour prices for drinks and appetizers are only good for the LEFT side of the dinning area.  - THAT'S STUPID -  I was really irritated that no one informed us about the fact that Happy Hour is only good on one half of the room. I was mad that the hostess who sat us didn't ask if we were interested in Happy Hour and I was mad at the waitress for not mentioning if we were only ordering drinks and appetizers that we should sit on the other side of the room to get better prices.  I feel that is bad customer service and makes me not want to come back here.  The Grub. [[ MAC & CHEESE $3.99 ]]   We decided to get the Southwestern mac n' cheese for an appetizer cause we just LOVE mac n' cheese!! :D The one served at Chili's is made with three cheeses, poblanco peppers and toasted bread crumbs! Super tastey! [[ NACHOS $7.99 ]]   Topped with 3-cheese blend, black beans, jalapenos. Also served with house-made pico de gallo & sour cream. We also added fresh guacamole for $1.49. I was actually surprised when this dish came out, because I was expecting, well you know a pile of chips covered in toppings. But the way this one is served was actually surprisingly good too.  [[ BOTTOMLESS TOSTADA CHIPS $4.99 ]] Extra thin corn tostada chips made fresh! These chips are surprisingly addicting. I definitely recommend getting these if you want something to share with friends.  Margarita Partyyyyyy.    [[ TROPICAL SUNRISE MARGARITA ]]   This drink is made with tequila, melon schnapps, pineapple juice and a splash of grenadine.Out of the three margaritas, this one is definitely my favorite.   [[ PLATINUM PRESIDENTE MARGARITA ]] Hand shaken tequila, orange liqeur, brandy and fresh sour.

351,Kuli O.,"Honolulu, HI",7,28,,1.0,2014-08-25,"Read my review, or read this first sentence and analogy: Chili's is the culinary equivalent of going to a refrozen sale at Safeway, and serving the twice refrozen goods at restaurant by heating them with a microwave or deep frier, however by marking up the food to prices higher than any reasonable competitors!   This may seem like a strong review but let me just cover some fundamental problems with this restaurant.       Firstly, although the waiters are quick to get your order in, they seem sloppy and immature without real training. I want to be treated by adults as an adult, I am not friends with the waitstaff. They need a serious manager.             Secondly, All of Chili's food is overpriced: everything is $13. For $13 I can go to Cafe Laufer and support a local business with excellent service and great clean food!  The cake is cheaper at Laufer, and ten times better than the boxed defrosted dessert at Chili's.    Thirdly, Chili's food is made on the mainland, and reheated here! There is no chef at this godforsaken place. Why don't people seem to know that?  When you order soup at Chili's it comes out of a big can!      Fourthly. the food is inauthentic. The Mexican dishes are tasteless and made by people who don't care about plate presentation or quality.  Everything was shocking: a tiny barely identifiable slice of avocado on my chicken sandwich, microwaved vegetables!!!!!  Finally, it hurt me to see a kind local family eating at Chili's spending their hard earned money at this dump when for the same price they could have gone to the Chinese across the street, CPK, or even kuru kuru.  IF you like Chili's slime burgers, phony chicken fried steak ( comes our of a freezer), you need to really stop eating campbell's soup, ramen from a package, and spam. Honolulu has great local restaurants and the last thing we need is another overpriced MCD's substitute!

Our server let my boyfriend and I have a few minutes to review the menu and said he'd be back in a couple to take our order. I think he forgot about us. Strike 1. By the time he came back to take our order, my boyfriend's parents were receiving their food. I had checked into yelp (*duh*) and found that there was an offer for free chips and queso! Who doesn't like a  deal?! So of course we took the deal. Our food eventually came though our server totally walked past our table, forgetting who the food was for. At that point, we were like ""maybe he has a bunch of tables tonight..."" and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. He also was not attentive to us and only cleared our dishes when we asked him to. Strike 2. The food wasn't terrible, but the reason this review is getting one star is because of what happened when we got the bill. My boyfriend has a mall discount so for Tuesday, it should have been 20% (or 25%?). When we tried to apply the discount, our server said that we couldn't apply two discounts (the yelp deal and the 20% discount) on the same bill. We didn't understand but we asked to pay for the queso and apply the 20% discount to the bill. FIRST our server tried to convince us that the discount for the queso was going to be the better deal than the 20% off. Um, let's do the math... NOPE, it was not the better deal. SECOND, he said that since he keyed in the queso discount, he could not override it to use the 20% discount instead. SAY WHAT? THEN the manager comes out and tells us that he is unable to override the computer and he cannot void the whole transaction so that they could start over. I call BS. Because we didn't want to make a scene in front of his parents, we didn't continue our fight (though the server and the manager were being ridiculous). So, whatever, we just paid the bill (their tip was us paying the part we would have been discounted). Strikes 3, 4, & 5 (yes, I know there are only 3 strikes in baseball, but that's how crap-tastic they were.)

That being said, there were a few things that bothered me.  The Ziosk along with the table caddies take up WAY too much table real estate.  If your going keep the Ziosks, get rid of those table caddies.  No need for me to read out dated material on a table flyer when I could look at the Ziosk.   If a food est. is going to go tech, then go tech... don't half ass it.  It should be up to consumer on whether or not I want to use the tech... or even see it for that matter.  It was distracting me from my company.  I would rather Chilis just make an app similar to CPK's take out app.  They could have QR codes or something else for a phone to scan to get the point of sale system the info in needs from your phone.  Lastly, I would like to say the our food was what I expected it to be.  Our server, a nice filipino girl with glasses... she did her job, we got our food in a timely manner, and our drinks were never empty.   Overall it was it was an ""a-ok"" experience.  I'll probably be back but, I'll remove the Ziosk from the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=240,2.64,2.72,2.72,2.668,2.688

237,Paul J.,"Honolulu, HI",0,23,1.0,1.0,2015-01-12,Been to this place many times and usually have a decent meal. I'm not sure what happened but the quality has taken a nose dive.  I had the worst ribeye steak ever; at least that's what I ordered. The cooks have no idea how to prepare and cook a steak. I asked for my steak to be cooked rare and  it came to my table a white raw piece of rubber that didn't resemble a ribeye. I sent it back to be cooked a little more and my waiter brought back what appeared to be an over microwaved unappealing piece of meat. The skillet mashed potatoes were just as bad.

Sometimes when I'm craving some Nasty Tex-Mex ribs.........I like to go to Chili's at the Kahala Mall Shopping Center. Yeah, the ribs are not the best that I've ever had, but at least they are consistent, and I know what I'm gonna get. They have two styles of ribs - the dry rib, & the bbq ribs. I've tried them both, but prefer the gooier sticky bbq ribs! :D  New on the menu, I hear they now offer a Dr. Pepper BBQ ribs, as well as a Craft Beer ribs too (will have to try that one day). With my ribs they offer several types of sides, but I'm a creature of habit, and I tend to get the same thing over, and over again............if it works, don't fix it right? Lol! I usually get the cinnamon apples, & steam broccoli for my sides.........so basically I'm getting a high calorie, high sugar meal........only to off set it with some healthy steamed broccoli. Well, two out of three ain't bad!  What can I say about the ribs.........tasty bbq flavor, meat on the ribs are not the meatiest, but it will do when I'm craving some ribs. The cinnamon apples are great! It's like eating a apple pie without a pie crust.........so basically your eating the apple pie guts! Lol! And of course the steamed broccoli, it's healthy........but nothing to write home about.  If you saw the Chili's web site on the calorie contents of their foods.............rest a sure, this is comfort food! Not the healthiest of food! The full rack of bbq ribs packs a 1240 calorie punch, and this doesn't include the addition 270 calories, and 24 grams of sugar for the cinnamon apples. For the steamed broccoli..........you know it's healthy as it's just 40 calories.

After drinking half of our drinks already my husband and I had to track down the bar back to get someone to order for us and it wasn't even that busy! She totally forgot about us. Then after we were done with our meal I put a gift card down to pay. When she came over to pick up the tab she saw the gift card and she grunted as if it was a big hassle for her.

We don't know why she had such a bad attitude  when my husband and I were nothing but pleasant with her. All we wanted was a quick and simple dinner.  She acted like we were a burden and was so displeasant and rude to us I almost didn't even want to tip and I'm usually a VERY generous tipper.  Sorry if you actually have to do your job!

Whenever we come here, I always order the regular guacamole and chips.  Yum, yum, yum!  It also comes with salsa.  My mom and I also order the California Turkey Club.  We split it and they are always nice to put our order on two separate plates so we don't have to split it ourselves.  We usually get a side order of sweet potato fries, which are usually delicious...but on this visit, we were told that they discontinued the sweet potato fries.  WHAT?!?!?!??!  That's the reason for a drop in stars.  Boo to you Chili's!  Our server even said that it's a popular item, but they still discontinued it.  Bring it back!  I don't even mind paying the extra $0.50 for it!   If you pay with a credit card, the servers are instructed to tell you to pay with the Ziosk machines that are left on your table.  These machines are a fancy distraction for those who patron the establishment.  You can pay to play games or use other various apps on the machine.  It's like a tablet.  I think these things are a waste of table space, but I can see the convenience.  Just swipe and your receipt is printed out.  There's also a tool that allows you to calculate the tip for you.  The junk thing about these receipts though is that they don't register on my Shoparoo app that gives me points for places that I spend money.  For some reason, whenever I take a picture of my receipts from these Ziosk machines, Shoparoo says it's an invalid receipt.  I never had this issue with the regular checks I used to get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=140,3.08,2.85,2.85,3.2120000000000006,2.942

My opinions about Chili's eMenu don't affect my star rating. The service was meh. The food was decent, but if you are on a diet, I don't recommend Chili's.

320,Rhonda V.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,2.0,2015-10-22,"OK, I normally don't leave negative reviews, but I was really bothered by the service we received.  So Chili's was celebrating their 21st Birthday with $5 margaritas and 21 cents chips and salsa last night.  I knew about this deal because I got an email and went there especially for the $5 margaritas.  I was extremely disappointed that an email blast and facebook post was sent about this deal, yet our server did not mention it at all, especially since we frequently go there and their ""supposedly celebrating"".  My husband arrived before me and had to ask about the deak.  When I arrived, I ordered the Platinum Presidente, which I got at regular price.  When I saw it, I asked her about the deal and she said I ordered the ""Platinum"" Presidente and not the Presidente.  Ok, I thought they were in the same category.  She did not even ask me if I wanted the Presidente instead or offer to take it back.  I would have at least expected her to MENTION the deal and let me decide if I wanted to get the Presidente instead when I placed my order.  Obviously we knew about it since my husband had ordered the margarita and the chips!  Our food was  burnt and the beef on the nachos tasteless.  We didn't even eat half of it.  The bartender was heavy-handed with the liquor too, so the drink was not enjoyable.  I didn't want to get drunk, I just wanted to relax after a hard day's work.  I ended up only drinking the one and my husband switched to beer.  To top it off, we were ready to leave and were going to pay our bill via the Ziosk so we could just leave.  Not the case.  When I pulled up our bill, I noticed an additional beer we did not order.  After waiting awhile for her to come by our table, I mentioned it and she says, oh yeah, I know, I have to take that off.  WTH?!  If you knew you had to take it off, why didn't you take it off when you added it by mistake?  If I didn't review my bill I would have just paid for it and been charged extra?  I always give at least 20% or more tip, but last night, she's lucky she got 16%.  It's all about customer service, and if I was getting tips, I certainly would be much more pleasant and helpful.  Service has gone down and no one smiles or seems happy to work there.  We REALLY miss Rachel!!!  Don't know if I'd go back if there wasn't a deal to be had.  Extremely Disappointed...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=400,3.48,3.11,3.11,2.9520000000000004,3.258

After taking a 5 year break from the big name restaurants, I decided to come back and give it a shot. The menu has changed quite a bit, which is expected. Prices seemed reasonable. I ordered a mix plate of chicken tostada, beef enchilada, and chicken tacos. It came with beans and rice. Not too much to say about the food in general. It was satisfying and the portions were big enough for me to take home as leftovers. There are a lot of other menu items that I would like to try next time. I was satisfied with the service.

There was a lot of F-bomb dropping and all kinds of sh*t being said. We like Chili's, but probably won't be back for a while. We couldn't wait to get out of there.

Also almost got hit with a backpack a couple of times not to mention another girl trying to join the group spilling some of her full beer mug.

101,Andy F.,"Honolulu, HI",63,209,978.0,4.0,2015-12-15,"*This is from last week's visit* I found my home! I found DolphinNation! I have found my favorite place for NFL Sunday football! Each sports bar has a predominant fanbase of a particular NFL team, Seahawks...ahemm. They are seemingly everywhere, and are quite.....passionate (?), sometimes overly passionate. Though, there was one ""fan"" who rolled in very late, and the Seahwaks game was already out of hand and switched to a better game. After some complaining, she left lol. Bye-bye! Anyway... what makes this place fun and great is the fact the bar area has exactly nine TVs that show every single game rather than the first come, first serve on the TVs and you get the same 2-3 games on all the TVs. The place was comfortable and cool, and clean. The fellow football fans were mellow and laid-back, which is such a welcome. Located in Kahala Mall, there is plenty of parking in the morning. Chili's offers a breakfast menu, but no bar food during that time. Other than the French Toast and Pancakes, everything else has basically the same ingredients served in different vessels. On this morning, we just ordered the Flatbread Sunrise ($10.99). The flatbread comes with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and cheese, and salsa and pico de gallo and cilantro. This may sound ridiculously simple, but it was good. It was like a breakfast pizza! The scramble eggs was the key ingredient that made this a successful dish. Anytime I order eggs, I never think it will turn out the way it's supposed to, especially scrambled eggs. I only hope it's not super dry and overcooked. In this case, the eggs were actually cooked well. It was moist, soft, and warm. The service was average. It seemed like they was short-staffed front and back, so the food took a really long time to come out (unless it was totally forgotten), and we were rarely checked on. Overall, I really enjoyed watching Sunday NFL football here. Other than D&Bs, there's really no other place where you can watch every single NFL game sitting at one spot. The place was nice and comfortable, and the food was good.

They are so great, and you can't beat the prices. But thats not all.. First- The food and drink. I am a vegetarian, like super hardcore strict vegetarian. I absolutely cannot have any meat or meat broth in my food or I get super nauseous. So, because of that I often times find it hard to eat out. I can say this establishment is very vegetarian-friendly. I either order a meatless flatbread, black bean burger, meatless cajun pasta, or a burrito without meat. They accommodate my needs so well. With the burrito, they will put it extra vegetables (including avocados) to replace the meat. The beers are great, I recommend having a beer -or 4- during happy hour, just don't drink and drive, please! I love to go there and watch the games during football season. By the way, the Molten Lava Cake is bomb. Seriously, get it, you won't be sorry. Customer Service! They are awesome.

We gave the 50% they took off the entree back in a tip, pay it forward a little bit. There has been times where I was in tears at the booth (bad news that day) and they helped turn that around. I could go on and on about their customer service, but I won't. Atmosphere. They recently renovated, and the ambiance is great. The booths are chairs are beautiful. You can come in and immediately feel relaxed. I also enjoy sitting outside -when the weather permits-.

We weren't trying to make it a big deal or anything, so when the manager came out to serve the newly filled chilled glass and personally apologize for the incident himself, it was a nice surprise.

227,Jennifer S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,1.0,2016-04-04,"I tried to give Chili's Kahala Mall a chance after numerous times of messing up our takeout orders, and well I'm regretting it now. Never order the sweet and Smoky Burger if you're not into bacon like I am not. I ordered the sweet Smoky Burger without bacon and low and behold when I open up my order it was full of bacon. I spent the beginning of my meal I was hungry for doing a bacon excavation project then finally I found my burger. I said no bacon and it was almost like a joke with the way they went off on the bacon. Other than that the burger was bland and dry, I was very disappointed. I was thinking where is the sweet and spicy part? If I wanted a regular bacon burger I would have ordered that, and that's not what I ordered. If Chili's could put the energy they have on their baconating the heck out of a Burger on their sauces, we'd be great. Then my friends order of the Chipotle Chicken Crispers were wrong too. She instead got plain chicken crispers, the chicken Crispers weren't even crisp at all, very disappointing, and the fries that came with her order we're stail, as if they were leftover fries that were being passed on from plate to plate all day just so they can save time and money from fresh fries. The only thing in the order and our whole Chili's experience that seem to work out right were the Panko Onion Rings and the friendly staff. I know that people will say why didn't you stop and check your order before you left? Well you pick up your order at the side of a bar that is busy with Margarita fixings and I did not feel like putting my food on a bar floor and sifting through it to see if it was right, so I had to take my chance and see if it was right at home.

I'll probably take my chance with Chili's in Pearl City next time, even if it means I have to drive to another town. If that Chili's don't work out like the Kahala one I should just stick with CPK.

I informed them we were waiting for a while and the lady who I assume was the manager gave me attitude about it. When we finally got seated I had the hardest time trying to find something that would appeal to me so I decided on the Cajun pasta. Except I didn't want the Cajun or the chicken. I was able to not get the Cajun but I had to get either chicken or shrimp. When I got my food it was cold, there was barely anything on my plate, and I'm pretty sure I could cook better chicken than what they had on my plate mostly because I don't think it was cooked.

Its easy to look at our table and make an estimate on when to put in the order of the dessert and make it come out as soon as were done...  last the dessert came out with what looks like a spoon scooped ice cream... cant they use a regular ice cream scooper?  Lol Horrible service dont eat at kahala location... cooks and servers clearly dont care about service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=100,4.08,3.8,3.3,3.4920000000000004,3.912

The chicken breast was huge, it was juicy and had so much flavor with every bite. The broccoli was done just right and seasoned well, the wheatberry and quinoa blend was tasty and perfectly cooked, not dry at all like the other 2 locations.

Thank you, Alicia! Please keep up the fantastic work! Update: Another memorable experience at one of my favorite places.

The steak I ordered had a weird sauce and the steak wasn't even that juicy. It was supposed to be medium but more like well done. The shrimp that it came with was tiny and salty.

31,Kristine C.,"Honolulu, HI",899,443,8393.0,4.0,2017-03-24,"The last time I remembered visiting a Chili's was before the Waikiki location closed and if it hadn't closed, I'd more than likely eat there once a month. Alexander has been craving Chili's for quite some time and we finally gave it a go. Chili's in Kahala is hard to miss with their location being in the same property as Kahala Mall next to Whole Foods on Waialae Avenue. If I'm going to any restaurant chain, a surf and turf is my first go to. My family and I came on a weekday during spring break and the venue wasn't thankfully busy. We were immediately seated on an open high booth and next to the glass divide with the view of the bar. The bar houses a few TV screens angled on all directions for everyone to see. This would be a great bar for sports watching, drinking while socializing. The venue is comfortable with countless booths, and adjustable tables. The large Hawaii murals and colorful drinking glasses as light fixtures broadcasted an impression that you're indeed at a Chili's restaurant in Hawaii. David was our server for the evening and we had an offer for a free chips and salsa with guacamole or cheese. We chose the guacamole and it's not guac from a mixed package, it was real with chunks of tomatoes, bits of onions, cilantros. The chips were warm and fresh and we had two rounds of it. While the beverage menu is eclectic with cocktails and beers, I was hoping to have a virgin lava flow. But the bar couldn't make it. David returned and offered a virgin daiquiri and it was immensely sweet and good. The menu has an overwhelming selection of appetizers and mains with fries, wings, eggrolls, flatbreads, pasta, fajitas, seafood and steaks, and ribs. With a few customizations to the options, you can create your own perfect meal. I wanted the Honey-Chipotle Shrimp & Sirloin with asparagus, and loaded mashed potatoes. Alicia the general manager communicated with us that our meal would come out shortly and indeed it did. Our meal had a little bit of mix ups but was solved quickly. Initially I wanted my steak to be a medium rare and I got just what I had ordered. I had requested to have the steak be cooked a little more and David was very kind to take it back to the kitchen. The steak came back even better and melted like butter. The mashed potatoes were tasty and the asparagus was perfect. Due to the mix up I was happy to have inherited the extra corn and it was cooked just right without it sitting on the boiling water for a long time. I had a sample of ribs and it was delightfully tasty. She looked like she went to town and wiped the bone clean to the last cartilage. The quality of the meal is fair to the price and I wouldn't mind returning again to try the ribeye. The device on the table is entertaining with trivia for $1.99, survey options as well as an option to pay with your credit card. David stayed on top of his game and was never too busy to fill cups of waters and to chat a while. His manager asked that we leave a survey on the device at the table and we did just that. David left a lasting impression on us that night when we told him we would leave an honest survey. David said, ""The truth is better than lying no matter what it is.""

My favorite has always been Chili's due to their Mexican inspiration. It's a friendly neighborhood bar and restaurant; the host staff, bartenders, and waitstaff are all professional and friendly to ensure you have a good time. Our recent waiter David and the manager went out of their way to make sure we were happy, especially helping solve a problem with the orders we didn't even notice right away. With the closing of the Waikiki location, Kahala has been my go-to whenever I'm in the mood for their food. I've eaten here many times, sometimes at the bar, others at booths and tables. It's most fun to eat here with a group as the food is great for sharing. Portion sizes are consistent and not small. Prices aren't cheap nor expensive; you're getting what you're paying for. I always think the meats and vegetables are fresh, dishes are tasty and well seasoned. The menu is long, there's something for everyone. Be sure to pay attention to whatever specials are going on! For Yelp check-in, you get free chips and queso, so be sure to do that for some pre-dinner munchies.  They have an okay selection of draft beer and can make most typical hard drinks at the bar. This location is a stand-alone building on the Kahala Mall grounds. You can easily walk here from inside the mall, or park right next door for free. They have ample seating indoors and out.

115,Neal R.,"Honolulu, HI",73,3,2.0,1.0,2017-04-09,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE  Let me start out by saying that I have been going to this place for years. Every time I go I end up having a worse experience than the time before. This time was the last time that I will give it another chance.  As me and my girlfriend walked in we were not greeted, just stared at until I said something. I then asked the host if it was happy hour, because that would decide if I wanted to sit at the bar or in the dining area, he checked his phone and then said, ""I dont know."" He didn't ask if he should go find out but just stared at me with confusion. I then said we will just sit at a booth. He walked us passed several open booths near the window to then seat us in the very back corner right by the kitchen entrance. Trying to be positive I thought to myself maybe it was this servers turn to get a table and figured we would get our food faster sitting by the kitchen. We then asked one of the servers of it was happy hour and they didn't know either. You would think they would know, but I guess no one cares about making sales.  Our server comes up and is very polite asks us if we knew what we wanted to drink. We order a water and a Bloody Mary. When the Bloody Mary finally comes it looks as if the top 1/3 was just water. Mixed it and it still looked and tasted terrible. We then ordered food. I ordered the crispy crispers with double fries instead of fries and corn on the cob and she orders a margarita flatbread salad with the dressing on the side. The server brings out her salad and says, ""I'm so sorry but the kitchen didn't put the dressing on the side. If you want I can take it back and they can just pull of the salad and replace it."" My girlfriend didn't want to be rude or waste any food so she opted to keep it. And of course there was too much dressing and it wasn't they way she wanted it. My food didn't come for another 6-7 minutes. When it did the server puts it down and says, ""oh looks like they put the corn there as well but there are definitely two sides of fries there"" That was definitely not two sides of fries. I look at the plate and it's the wrong kind of chicken. I ask the server if this is what I ordered, knowing it was not. She replied, ""Oh yah I think they changed the batter and that's how it's made now but I will double check"" She comes back about 5 mins later saying sorry and that I can keep that but they will bring out my original order in just a few minutes. 6-7 more minutes pass and they finally bring the chicken that I ordered still with only one side fries and another corn on the cob. By this time we both have lost our appetite by having such a bad experience we box up our food and leave. And of course on our way out the host just stares at us and doesn't say anything as we leave. Definitely will not be going back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=80,4.24,4.01,3.448,3.0120000000000005,4.102

She didnt seem like a snob, just maybe lost unless shes training? But their was another worker who came to us and seated us.  Our waitor was nice. Came in often to check on us, but idk if were suppose to ask for napkins or he forgot? I need more napkins for desserts, & I he forgot, but not a biggie. But I need napkins especially with the kids lols.  Another downside was that they only had 1 pasta dish & it was cajun pasta. Im not a huge fan of spicy. I can handle a little but not a lot, so I didnt know how spicy it was. I asked the waitor how spicy it was, but he didnt know as well since he hasnt tried it  I did however like the fact that their keikis menu was 1 same price for all; unlike othet restaurant, it varies. The food was AMAZING!!!  Chicken quesadilla was good!! Not oily and3 the crisp on the tortilla was perfect. And it waa ready to eat, not hot hot.  Bf ordered the steak, he loves it! Not much cooks can cook steak the way he likes it.  Surprisingly, the kids ate all the food! I like the amount given, just right!   Desserts was SOO GOOD!! I ordered the berrys with cake & ice cream.

Our waiter was very patient with us, (we were a party of 8) and for most of us this was our first time in a Chili's restaurant. There were so many choices to choose from, it took us awhile to decide what we wanted to order. In the meantime our waiter takes our orders for drinks, he brings four of us ours, then we ask where the rest of the drinks are, and he says the bartender is making them, um......the missing drink was a coke, how hard is it to make that? My niece ordered a budlite-rita (a margarita with a little bud light bottle stuck in the drink)...as the waitress is bringing it to the table she spills the drink not on one but two of us...by then half the drink is gone, and she plops it on the table and walks away....I told my niece to be sure to tell the waitress that she will only pay for half the drink since  that's all that was left in the cup! Anyway, back to the food, I had the chicken quesadilla which was really delicious, my son had the bacon burger sliders, my brother had the ribs, which he said was ok, but for the price should've been a lot better. My sisters had the salad one said it was really delicious, the other said it was ok! The chips and salsa were really good.We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip, which seemed a bit pricey and we didn't get any chips or bread to eat with it, so I am not quite sure why they call it a dip if there is nothing to dip with...Overall the service was ok..food was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=160,3.92,4.09,3.512,3.0840000000000005,4.022

It was busy but the wait was less than an hour so I was sold. I ordered the 3 items for $15.99 deal (salad, chicken fajita and molten yum!). I was told they were out of the mini molten :( but that they would be giving a free upgrade to the regular size because of it. Yes! Bf ordered his food and a cup of soup. They ended up messing it up and bringing an additional cup for free on accident. The soup was warm if that though. Meh but hey it's free. Service was good especially since they hooked it up.  Fast forward to a few nights later (birthday dinner). Great service again. One of us ordered steak and the server said she would check to see if it was the right size since it looked a little tiny. Come to find out she was right. It was the 6 oz instead of the 10 oz. so to make up for it they gave an extra 6 oz steak for free. Nice! We also got an extra fries for free.

My last visited entailed me ordering the Margarita Grilled Chicken and my boyfriend ordering the Triple Dipper appetizer as his meal. My grilled chicken was very interesting! The chicken had a nice sweet margarita sauce that was complemented well with the crunchy tortilla strips, pico de gallo, black beans and rice. The portions are enough to satisfy but not overkill. My boyfriend's Triple Dipper looked very yummy. The sauce for the chicken was quite strong and this may be good for some and maybe not for others. However, we were satisfied with the overall quality, taste, and portions. The staff working there is very accommodating and gives great service.

She came over to our table to apologize for the hair and to assure us that Chili's has quality checks in place that usually catch these things. . Unfortunately, she was unaware of the first problem - that we ordered the Triple Dipper with Big Mouth Bites and not the Southwestern Egg Rolls. And that after being informed, Rodney took the plate back to the kitchen, dumped the egg rolls and brought back the plate with the rest of th food saying the kitchen would correct our order.  Alicia offered to get us something else to eat. (Considering what happened with this experience we declined.) She comped our drinks and gave us gift certificates and her business card saying if we give Chili's (any Chili's) another chance to make sure we give her card to our server so that they can involve the manager on duty and make sure to make our next visit superb.

42,Michael K.,"Honolulu, HI",36,8,28.0,5.0,2017-11-15,"*Before I start my review, I just want to put in that I do not usually do reviews for large chain restaurants. As I said earlier, this is a very unexpected review for me, but the service that I received definitely made this review an exception. I go to Chili's enough where I already have an expectation of food quality, service, and atmosphere. The environment is usually loud, the food is alright, and from my earlier visits, the service was below par compared to other large chain restaurants. I went in with two other friends on Veteran's Day because we were looking at the sales for the stores at Kahala Mall. I was expecting it to be busy and for the service to be slow, but my friends really wanted to go to eat there. I was served by two ladies, Courtney and I believe the other girl's name was Laney. They were friendly even in the loud environment, serving us with a smile, and I really appreciated that. Our table decided to start with some appetizers. We ordered the Texas Cheese Fries and Chips and Salsa, along with some soft drinks. It was time to order, but I usually like to ask for suggestions just to see if maybe I will try something new. I usually go for the Old Timer Burger with Cheese. You cannot go wrong with a burger, and Chili's burgers are pretty decent. Courtney suggested a couple of items. She suggested the ribs , the Southern Smokehouse Burger, and the Cajun Chicken Pasta. She gave great descriptions on all the items, which I never knew about beforehand. For the first time there, I was stumped on what to order. My friends went first, getting the Steak Fajitas and Margherita Flatbread. I was indecisive at first, but I was pleasantly surprised that Courtney did not try to rush me. She told me to just let her know when I have decided, and she started asking my friends about why we were in the area and if we were from here, and other small talk. This made me pleasantly surprised, knowing that our waiter was definitely personable. While this was going on Laney came out with our appetizers, which I thought was very fast. I finally decided on the Southern Smokehouse Burger. Courtney closed up the conversation politely and left to put our order in. We only waited about 8-10 min for our food, and in that time Laney did not fail in making sure our drinks were filled. I never once had to think about if I needed to ask for a refill, which is very comforting for me. Our food came out steaming, and I was definitely pleased with my meal. My burger's sauces were amazing. There was a special sauce inside, a bbq sauce to dip in, and the onion rings were great. My friends seemed to enjoy their food as well, but I was too focused on my food. I was impressed when Laney came over to ask our table if we were okay, and then asked me if the burger was alright, or if I wanted to get something else instead. This showed that Courtney communicated to her that this was my first time ordering the burger, and that was very commendable. At the end of our meal (our drinks still did not go empty by the way) we were way too full for dessert. I paid through the Ziosk, which is very convenient, and we left a generous tip showing our appreciation for the great service. We all decided that whenever we go to that Chili's, we would ask for Courtney or Laney because of the great impression they left. This experience changed my whole perception on Chili's. I do hope that eventually they get promoted/rewarded for their teamwork, hospitality, and great customer service.

43,Debra A.,"Pearl City, HI",1,50,141.0,4.0,2017-11-20,"I had to get my table-side guacamole fix today. Love it! Keli provided us with outstanding service; friendly, knowledgeable, personable, yet professional. Upon check-in on Yelp, I had an offer for free chips and queso, which was absolutely delicious! I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta; Alfredo sauce, chicken, and Cajun spices, and it wasn't spicy, which I loved. My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla with extra sour cream. She added table-side Guacamole on top for a custom dish, which was also delicious.  There's ample parking during lunch hours. Evening parking can be a challenge, but not impossible. Service was quick and efficient. I'll definitely make a return visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5?start=40,3.84,3.79,3.736,,3.81

2,Blake A.,"Honolulu, HI",2,126,334.0,5.0,2017-12-04,"So after my last visit I was contacted by Chili's general manager, Alicia, regarding my last experience.  She assured me that what I experienced did not meet their expectations and welcomed me back for another meal.   My next visit did not disappoint.  Servers Alex and Mark were excellent and provided great service. They both had very friendly attitudes and made sure me and my wife got everything we needed.  We got the chips and salsa with queso and chicken enchilada soup. I never tried the queso or chicken enchilada soup with the chips before but they were excellent.  The manager on duty, Kate, recommended it and it will now be a go to when I eat here.  For entrees, I order my usual, steak and chicken fajitas, while the wife ordered the Cajun Alfredo pasta with chicken.  The food was very tasty as usual and came out quickly.  We were checked on throughout the meal by our servers, as well as Kate, to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  After the meal, dessert was considered but we both were too full and regretfully passed. I really hold Chili's in high regards for the way they went out of their way to make sure me and my wife had a positive experience at their restaurant.  Alicia, Kate, Alex, and Mark provided me and my wife with not just a meal, but with a memory that we will remember for a lifetime. Even though Chili's is a nationwide ""chain"" restaurant, I feel that they really value their customers like a family owned restaurant.  I have memories of visiting Chilis with my parents and am now currently doing it with my wife. I will be a loyal patron to this restaurant and hopefully bring my kids here one day so we can continue to support a restaurant that has values.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5,4.16,3.81,3.756,,3.95

0,Gina H.,"Honolulu, HI",183,91,230.0,4.0,2018-01-08,Very nice experience at lunch thanks to bartender Kelly (sp?). She was very busy serving the bar and tables but still had a smile on her face.  She answered questions and made us feel cared for.  She is the main reason for the extra star. Lol Don't forget to check in for free chips and queso.  They have the best chips and salsa. Queso just blah.  We ordered the triple sampler.  You have a choice of 3 different. Chicken crispers are a must.  I usually like the egg rolls but they were extra smoky today.  My bf said the bacon burger was delicious. Fries were thick cut and fried well.  I had the quesadilla explosion salad and that was soo ono!! Lots of chicken and totally worth it. If you are worried about calories ask for the dressing on the side.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.  Don't forget to check in on yelp for your free chips and queso dip.  Chili's please don't get rid of the chips and salsa for checking in.  They are my favorite.  Thin and crispy pieces of heaven.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-honolulu-5,4.2,3.76,3.788,,3.936
