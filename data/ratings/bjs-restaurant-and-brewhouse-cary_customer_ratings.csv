104,Daisy B.,"Durham, NC",21,19,1.0,4.0,2016-09-15,"My friend and I dined at BJ's yesterday- one day after they opened. I had received a promo invitation to dine for free off of a specific menu to check the place out. We were not disappointed. The place is huge, clean, and open. They have a huge listing of beer (and some cider, too) on their board, along with a full drink menu (drinks aren't cheap, but they are creative). Their staff were great and you would not know that they had only opened ONE DAY earlier! Although there was a lot of staff on hand, things appeared to run smoothly and I am impressed at how well they were doing. My friend had the Bacon/Avocado/Cheese sandwich and said it was greasy goodness. I had the buttermilk fried chicken and mashed potatoes. All was very good. Comfort food, not so much bar food, but their entire menu includes burgers, pizza, etc. and everything that people ordered looked great and plentiful. I had a skinny margarita, which was tasty, and my friend had a Bloody Mary that she said was awesome. I hope this place does well and I look forward to returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=100,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

12,Tammy M.,"Cary, NC",27,181,264.0,5.0,2016-09-22,"Couldn't wait for their opening !!  We were immediately seated on a Wed evening.  After glancing at the menu we decided we wanted to try the specials that were only available in the bar seating area.  We switched over to the bar. Our waitress was fabulous !!  She explained all of their ""brewery"" beers and mentioned that they were all $4. (NOT the Octobefest).   The beer was very good.  We tried the boneless wings (buffalo style) and the California Flatbread.  Both were delicious. If you are going to go here and eat/drink be sure and download their APP.  I downloaded while we were there and we got a FREE Pizookie (it was a small one).  This dessert is like ""what"" !!!!!!!  It's so good !!!!  The small one looks like it was baked in an easy bake oven but once you take a bite......""who cares where it was baked"".  This dessert rocks !!!!!   Be sure and give it a try.

My fiancé and I went last night for dinner. There was a wait for a traditional table so we opted to sit in the bar area. We had our order taken promptly and received our food and beer much faster than expected, so that was a plus. Unfortunately, the wait staff in the bar area were wandering around lost, offering us everybody else's food because they were unsure of the correct tables, which was unprofessional at best. There were also some minor flaws with our order (I ordered no tomatoes on my sandwich and got them anyway, etc.) and it took over 20 minutes for us to get our Pizookie. I understand that they just opened and still need to work out the kinks, but the food quality was good enough to balance out the minor flaws. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=100,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007
78,Jessica R.,"Raleigh, NC",0,8,,1.0,2016-09-25,"On 09/25/16 at 4pm, my husband and I were really looking forward to trying this place! As we walked up to the door, we noticed two kitchen employees in their uniform smoking outside on the black bench to the left of the restaurant. We approached the host stand anyway. The host was busy doing something to the computer and did not acknowledge us for 45 seconds (they were not busy and we were standing literally 2 feet from him). Finally, he looked up and seemed genuinely surprised we were there...or maybe we interrupted his game of Candy Crush, we will never really know.  We were sat and given menus. The menu looked delicious and the beer list is to die for (I was gonna try the roasted kale and brussel sprout salad)...But you know what? We never were given the chance to order anything. We waited 9 minutes. Six waitstaff passed us and not a single one said ""hey I'll be right there"". The table behind us was arguing with the waiter that he incorrectly charged items on their check. Huge red flags everywhere so we decided to leave. As we left, the host WHO JUST SAT US 10 minutes ago says 'have a nice night'...Really? So I told him we waited for 10 minutes and no one even came over to greet us. He rolled his eyes and just said 'sorry'...Apparently this must happen quite often. Anyway, if you got PLENTY of time, try this place out. But if time is of the essence to you, do what we did...go down the road to Waverly Place and try out T. Mac Restaurant. Equivalent menu and equal OR BETTER beer list than BJ's. And they acknowledge you and appreciate your time. I know BJ's is new, and I was ready for some bumps, but not a freggin' cigarette stinking giant road block you can't get around.

Four salad entrées and one burger were all just OK. Chicken tortilla soup was way too salty. The manager came over and offered his apologies but It really couldn't help much. It was actually kind of laughable as the waitress explained that the soups should have come out with the salad despite the fact that we ordered them as appetizers. We are all from out of town so don't know anything about this chain, at least it looks like a chain.

66,Michael N.,"Raleigh, NC",77,7,1.0,4.0,2016-10-02,New to the scene is BJ's in Cary. A friend and I have went their twice so far. It's a very open area with good seating and flow. We dabbled in their beer selection and had some appetizers. We had no complaints with either. The beer had some ups and downs but that's not to knock the establishment as everyone has different flavor pallets. The appetizers were really tasty though.  Overall this place is in a great location for me and has everything a Brewhouse needs... beer and food. The one flaw I find is there isn't any outdoor seating. That is the only thing I wish it had.

For drinks.. Mom went with a mimosa, I would not recommend since it was almost $9 (there are too many brunch spots around with mimosa deals) I decided to try the beers that they brew so I ordered two flights. The beers were okay, if I had to pick a favorite it would be the Harvest Hefeweizen.       -Flight 1: Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, Jeremiah Red Ale and a Bourbon Barrel Stout       -Flight 2: IPA, Piranha Pale Ale, PM Porter and Tatonka Stout    For food.. We decided to split the Ahi Poke, Chicken Pot Stickers and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. All of the food was good but nothing was great. The Ahi Poke did not have enough avocado in it and the dumpling was too thick on the pot stickers. And, the food took forever to come out but I thought that our server did a great job taking care of us.  The space itself is huge and a good spot if you want to check out a game.

Things started out well. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We had the Brussels sprouts appetizer and it was really flavorful. I ordered a small BBQ chicken pizza, my husband ordered tacos, my mom ordered a burger. The wait was excessive. Our waitress brought my mom and husbands enterees and told me that someone else took my pizza. Welllll then. She offered something else but I declined thinking it wouldn't take long at all to make my pizza. I was wrong. Finally a manager came over and said the pizza was on him and I took him up on his offer of something else. I asked for tortilla soup and said we'd need to take the pizza to go...our son's bedtime was creeping up.  The tortilla soup was soooo salty that I didn't eat it - I couldn't. Didn't bother to say anything because this was turning into kind of a train wreck. Waited more for the pizza and asked for the check. An hour an a half total spent here and I can't say I would go back. My pizza ended up not tasting great, the soup wasn't good, and overall it left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun).

Our table ordered a little bit of everything and shared it all.  The Avocado Egg Rolls were delicious, a tasty combination of ingredients fried quickly to perfection and served with sweet tamarind sauce.  Crisp Potato Skins had excellent texture, I think they must bake then flash fry right before topping with the hickory smoked bacon / cheese and then a last minute quick trip into a Salamander.  Not greasy at all, an old favorite brought back to new standards!  Several varieties of wings were ordered, I liked the regular with Sriracha Dry Rub the best, did not care for the boneless too much.   To finish up our table tried the thin crust Pizza.  All toppings were top quality, the Italian Sausage for instance was in nice sized pieces and had a very good flavor, spiced just right.  I saw several people enjoying the Deep Dish Pizza and it looked filling but great.  That would be on my list to try on a future visit for sure.  Beer selection was more than adequate, not sure total # of taps but plenty.  Some guys with me had flights and were not disappointed with anything they tried before picking favorites.  I saw they had a limited release Green Flash collaboration (a favorite West Coast Brewery of mine) - Hop Pact Rye IPA and went straight for that and stuck with it. Service was great, Jessica J. knew her beers and took care of us during a very busy Saturday afternoon.  A manager stopped by and comped an order of wings that took a bit too long without us asking which was nice.  I'll definitely add BJ's to my list of places to return to when in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.512,3.2400000000000007

They do serve huge portions but I didn't eat much and didn't take the leftovers.

Ale House is geared more towards large groups and younger people who just want to hang out and drink while the game is on. This place is geared more towards people who want to enjoy a game or a drink and not deal with rowdy people.   I will say that their beer selection isn't as diverse as the Ale House's. Roughly 70% of their beer is their own specialty beer. Which I don't mind. I like trying new things. It's a great place to go on a date or to meet family or friends.

I came here for a work dinner a couple weeks ago & was sorely unimpressed.  Located in the Cary Crossroads area near Petsmart, BJ's has a great idea & concept, but it's the epitome of an American chain restaurant. With a 19 page menu, what could you possibly perfect when your kitchen has 19 pages of meals to make?!  At least they brew decent beer...  The service was interesting, at best. We had a guy taking drink orders but deferred all food questions to a female server. With 15 guys & 2 girls at the table, the server made it a point to say ""Ladies it's 1/2 price wine night!"" (assuming guys don't drink wine?! or that ladies only drink wine?). Anyway, no thanks- I like bourbon neat. The drink guy didn't know what Basil Hayden bourbon was (& it was at the top of their bourbon list). A plus is that you get 2 free tastes of their drafts, which I enjoyed the stout (though on nitro, not my fave). With the crazy service going on, it took 30+ minutes for everyone to fully order a drink. Maybe you need 30mins to read the novel of a menu? After our drinks all arrived, we slowly got appetizers & the food runners would just come to the dining area & holler out what they had - not even to the right table or anything. WTF? To boot, the apps were just like an Applebee's samplers- nothing special... in fact, some things were really weird (i.e. parmesan cream coated boneless wings). For my entree, I ordered a ribeye cooked rare with a side of mashed potatoes & a caesar salad. The salad came out at the exact time of my entree, and I think it was warmer than the steak & potatoes combined. The plating was awful (an ice cream scoop of potatoes & a dry ass ribeye). All in all, this was just terrible. I'd say the service was some of the most horrendous I've had in a while, but man, that steak was atrocious too. It wasn't Applebee's priced either (think $25 for the ribeye). We were there for 2.5hours & not by choice, so I can't say I'd willingly make it back to this place.  Noooope.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=20,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.6000000000000005,2.76

The overwhelming flavor was chili flake. I, too, put chili flake in my spaghetti but this amount is way too much. The portion was huge. I would like to pay a little less and get a little less. No one wants a to go bag at lunch.  My husband said his sandwich was great except his bread was somewhat greasy, it had been over buttered or left to sit. In addition, the cream soda tasted fake.

We were seated in a booth near the bar and had a view of the restaurant and TVs by the bar. The bar as well as the dining area were busy and I was surprised how quiet it was. Most bars and restaurants are so loud that it is difficult to talk amidst the noise. We also went on a Tuesday so all wines were half-price (score!) I had a very generous pour of La Crema Pinot noir for under $8. For my entree I had the tuna salad and it was a healthy and fresh choice. My friends had the flatbread pizza and it was thin crust with toppings. I liked the boards showing the beer offerings and believe BJ's has its own beer from Texas?

38,Erica B.,"Raleigh, NC",2,48,20.0,1.0,2016-12-14,"Our second visit was a huge disaster. Since there are limited late night dine in options around the Triangle area, we decided on BJ's last saturday night. They were open until 1am, but there were only one other table when we arrived around 11:45pm. The host didn't seem to be happy to see us. Then he reluctantly proceeded to seat us.  We quickly ordered some appetizers and four Top Sirloins. When the sirloins came out after 30 mins of waiting, we disappointedly found out that NONE of their temperature was cooked right. The medium was cooked Medium well, and Medium well was cooked well done. We brought it to our server's attention, and without telling us what she was going to do, she just turned around and left. We had to yell to get someone's attention to find out where our server was. We realized from that someone that our server went to order us another sirloin. That someone happened to be the manager, and seems to know exactly what was going on. However, it was a shame that he didn't make the initiative to make things right before we had asked him to come over. He discounted our checks, but did not to take the returned sirloins off our check. We had to point out him that we were charged for the orders that we had returned. He later took the returned sirloins off the check, but removed the discount. He seemed a little annoyed, and seriously we feel apologetic to cause such a scene late Saturday night. However, as a customer, we didn't feel like we were treated well, not to mention friendliness service. We left on a hungry stomach because we barely had anything to eat.  We are full of the mediocre food and service. This location offers great Grand Opening deals, but sorry, we will most definitely not return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.724,2.8

The main difference in my rating this time was the service. Though our waiter was very nice whenever we got his attention, having him come by our table was a tough one. They were very busy and clearly under staffed. So I just reached out to the manager who was glad to step in and take our drink orders after we had sat for 10min with no one coming up to us. It was about 20 min (since sitting down) when our waiter came with our drinks and asked us what we wanted to eat. I just know, had I not gone and gotten someone to take our orders, we'd had sat there much longer without seeing a single waiter. At the end, he, for whatever reason, had issues with my bj's rewards cards so now I'll have to call up the restaurant to make sure I get my points. Either way I still enjoyed coming by. I had the stout again, still delicious. I ordered garlic parmesan chicken wings. Those were disappointing. The chicken was delicious, but being a garlic parmesan fiend, the barely-drizzle-of-the-sauce on top was rather disappointing. Ate them all anyway. My friend had the open faced burger. That was delicious as well. Overall will still come by.

Decor at BJ's is modern and open, there's one large dining room with an enclosed ""patio"" area for more sunlight. It can work for a date, small group or family meal but not as well for large groups.

(We really love good root beer!) They also served it up in a frosty mug so it had those tiny little ice crystals at the top of the drink--perfect!  For my main dish, I got the southern fried chicken with white gravy, cheddar mashed potatoes, and succotash.  Nice warm, home style type food, and the chicken was very tasty.  There was a slight misunderstanding in the kitchen so I got the lunch portion instead of the dinner portion that I had requested, but they realized the issue without me having to say a word, and fixed it immediately.  The customer service and attentiveness we received was top-notch, between our waiter and the management staff.  Atmosphere wise, the place would be great for a group outing, or watching a game with the good sized booths and big tv's spread out on the walls.   Overall, great visit, and we'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=120,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.124,3.1200000000000006

59,Taylor M.,"Cary, NC",0,137,1.0,2.0,2017-04-09,"I've now tried a couple of these chain restaurants and the service and food have proven to be spotty at best.  The local Cary version is OK for what it is, but I guess I'm not into what that is anymore.   Any time a restaurant boasts about the breadth of their menu, run the other way.  They proudly pointed out to our party the voluminous menu.  As I have stated before, I'd rather eat at a place that crafts six dishes very well than a place with a monster menu. There is no kitchen in a chain restaurant yet designed that can make that many diverse meals consistently good.  Just like Cheesecake Factory, BJ's is another case in point.  Their beers are just OK, and there's nothing spectacular or really interesting about them. The trend in modern taverns and pubs is to have a variety of beers from a variety of brewers. At BJ's, it's just not fun to have their house brews foisted on you.  They make a lot of styles, but like their food, the quantity works against quality.   The food we had was bland bar food.  I've made the mistake of ordering food like jambalaya in places like this, because I knew it was guaranteed disappointment.  They can barely whip up a burger.   The waitstaff was indifferent if not totally inefficient. I assume there is lots of turnover in the waitstaff ranks and likely the kitchen as well.  It just comes off as one of ""those"" places.  It looks like the type of place you can convince your elderly, teetotaler aunt to go on Sunday afternoon, so at least you can grab a couple beers.  Atmosphere is basically a glorified Applebees.  Who though this was a great idea for a chain?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=20,3.12,3.07,3.07,2.568,3.09

My friend is a member of their rewards program and wrote a review through the app. She was soon contacted by the manager who was genuinely concerned about our poor experience and asked that we give them another shot, offering a gift card as incentive. The management definitely seems to care about the success of the business and values feedback.  We went back today to give them another shot and the food was much better. We didn't let the manager know we were there as a kind of 'blind' test and we were pleased with how it all went.  The food is all typical American fare burgers, pizza, pasta and such. Between the four of us we've tried the grilled cheese, California club, a tavern pizza, burgers, and the Parmesan chicken. So far nothing has struck us as amazing, but the beer selection is good draw. I think we'll be giving this place a few more chances and hopefully find some dishes they excel at.

62,Ann D.,"Apex, NC",8,25,,4.0,2017-04-23,"This was our first time visiting a BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  We arrived about 12:30 on  Sunday and were seated promptly.  The menu has so much variety.  I was particularly happy to see the EnLightend menu which has many options for lighter as well as gluten free fare.  Calories counts are included.  I do wish they included calorie counts for their standard fare, but I guess they figure those who order off the EnLightened menu don't care!  They also have gluten free options for pizza and their famous dessert Pizookie.  We did not try the Pizookie, but we plan to in the future. it looks divine. As far as prices, they are a bit on the high side.  I ordered the New Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Qunioa Bowl.  My husband ordered their half rack of ribs and some fries. The half rack came with a cole slaw that looked more like a salad.  My husband didn't want that so instead ordered the fries which was an upcharge.  They would not substitute the slaw for the fries which I found a little annoying since many restaurants do this with no problem whatsoever. And frankly, most restaurants would probably include slaw and fries for the price. Our food overall was actually very good. The only real downside to our visit was the slowness of the wait staff.  Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and it took about an hour to get our food.  We had a hard time flagging anyone to get ketchup for our fries and then it took another 20 minutes just to get our check.  Our waitress was very apologetic and even went into detail about how she had a mishap with a large party which slowed her down. Whatever the reason, we felt it wasn't something as a customer we need to be concerned with.  Management should be out there working themselves when there is a backlog!  I've seen it in many other establishments!   So if you like a menu with variety, give it a shot. Hopefully this slow service will improve.  We can't comment on their beer or handcrafted beverages, but they all looked very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=80,3.36,3.12,3.12,2.48,3.2160000000000006

I was pleasantly surprised at how good the beer is: I got a sampler and tried the Blonde, the Porter, the Brewnette and the Stout. All of them very drinkable at a good price. I've had worse beers at fancier brewpubs. The food was also decent and a good value. The menu was big -- too big -- but with a number of delicious-looking options. We both got tacos and enjoyed the soft pita shell that had a nice brown crust. The side was a slightly sweet grain-based salad with corn and black beans. Nothing fancy, but it was satisfying and a good weeknight meal. The service from Geneva was awesome -- she was friendly and had a great sense of humor, and was very efficient.

20,Brendan B.,"Apex, NC",2,20,8.0,2.0,2017-05-16,"My family visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse for the first time this past weekend.  We were excited since the Cary/Apex area needs more nicer, professionally-run restaurants. The building and interior are beautiful, so expectations were high.  We sat at a high table in the bar area since the dining room was full.  The bar is probably the best-looking and well-designed bar I've seen in a long time.  Our waitress came and presented us with the large menu. I cannot believe they have a menu this large.  It goes on for pages and pages.  There were so many things I wanted to try.  When our waitress took our drink order, my wife asked if the sweet tea was really sweet.  The waitress replied ""It's sweet."" Okay.  Not sure that helped much.  We all ordered sweet tea and it must have been sugared twice because it was way too sweet.  When we told her, she brought a glass of unsweet tea for us to mix.  This was all a hassle, made a mess and never was really corrected throughout the meal.  The waitress never really did fix the situation. The manager did stop by and said he had made new tea and brought some, but it was under-sweetened.   I got the Prime Rib Dip, which looked good, but at $14+, it had better be great.  It was on par, if not slightly below, the Beefeater sandwich at Jason's Deli, which is only $8.99.  The fries were good. My daughter got Chicken Alfredo, which wasn't very good.  The pasta was bland with no seasoning, but the sauce and marinated tasted odd.

I went back there alone for lunch and figured I'd give the pizza one more shot.  Instead of a special, I just ordered extra cheese and meatball.  Again, BLAND!  No taste at all, and dry!  If there was extra cheese, I could not tell.  About two inches from the crust, there was nothing.  As far as meatballs go, and this is not an exaggeration, it was as if they scooped out a teaspoon of meatball and sprinkled it on a large pie.   I questioned my super friendly waitress if this was really an extra cheese with meatball.  She said that's what she ordered for me.  The manager came over an offered to make another but I passed.  It was just a waste of calories.  I had tiny slice and left it.  I can enjoy a bad pizza, and even a cheap pizza as well as a good NY style (Try Ricci's Trattoria-the best!!!), but this was just dry and tasteless dough.   I'm afraid to waste my money on anything else there based on these items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=60,3.2,3.09,3.09,2.3440000000000003,3.134

The food is tasty once you get it, but pricey.  Also, they went from very good skinny french fries to a slightly thicker version. Our waiter told us its because the skinny fries got cold too quickly.

The menu was extensive and unique - it had many items I rarely or never see in other restaurants. Prices were reasonable and most of the food my table ordered tasted good. Environment was nicely decorated and comfortable. Waiters were friendly and attentive. Food did take a bit longer to arrive than most other restaurants, but that's the downside of having a monstrously large menu. It slows down the kitchen significantly. The only things wrong were unfortunately really big things to get wrong - cleanliness and food safety. The booth I was seated at had food on it when I sat down. Both mine and my husband's cloth napkins had bits of someone else's food in them when they were unrolled, and my utensils came dirty. My husband's drink came with a greasy straw that also had chunks of food on it - maybe the server who placed the straw had dirty hands? The artichoke dip we ordered came cold as if it had been scooped out of a pot that had been sitting in the back kitchen for far too long and the cheese sticks and avocado rolls were lukewarm. Given that their sanitation score is just 92, I worry what goes on back there. My husband had come here a couple weeks ago and had a similar experience with severely undercooked food that had to be sent back to the kitchen. I do give the manager a lot of credit for trying to make it right and taking some stuff off of our bill.

41,Bill L.,"Apex, NC",0,13,4.0,2.0,2017-07-27,"Have wanted to stop here for quite a while, as it has a classy look that at least presents as an ""upper-end"" sports bar / gastropub. The first time I had tried to eat here they were just opening up and had a private party that night.  Unfortunately, my first experience was not up to par with what I had hoped it would be. The recent comments about having to wait a long time were not the case for me, as I was seated upon arrival and it was 7:45 pm - prime time for dinner and after work drinks for most, so that was certainly a plus. I got a table in the bar area and the noise level is fairly high, as one would expect in a sports bar type setting.  Unfortunately, speed of service at a restaurant has some potential negative consequences as the food staff tries to ""rush"" orders out. I had ordered a healthy salad with Cajun shrimp on top (fairly simple request and dish to make). When it arrived you could very easily see that about half of the shrimp were still raw, as they were gray like when you first remove them from the freezer raw.  Since my grandfather was a chef, I eat at restaurants all over the country, and I owned and ran my own food & environmental testing wcompany for many years that did ""mock"" health inspections for restaurants - I spotted the issue right away and called the waitress over. She was very apologetic & commented that it did not look right to her when she brought it out either. Since the largest section of the shrimp is what was still under cooked and grey, it is likely that they had pulled the shrimp right out of the freezer and threw it onto the grill, and thus the thickest part failed to cook as well as the tail section while it thawed on the grill. She returned it to the kitchen to get it corrected. Shortly thereafter the manager also came over to apologize and said that he would have it fixed as well (all good and appropriate actions). The new salad came out and was done correctly, with the shrimp pink but not rubbery from being over-cooked either. The manager said he would swing by to check when the new salad came out - but that never happened.  Since I was curious to see what, if anything, they may do for sending me undercooked shrimp (a good restaurant will offer discount, free drink or dessert, or coupon with request to ""please"" return) - I ordered strawberry beignet for dessert. Though it was certainly tasty, and probably not worth all the added calories, the center of it was raw dough as well and needed a few more minutes of baking time - again, a negative result of trying to rush the food out - likely because of prior negative comments on Yelp about waiting time. Fortunately, a piece of slightly raw dough generally won't cause a food sickness, unlike the havoc that some raw seafood can cause for a visitor. All said and done, the waitress did once again apologize and even removed the desert from my bill, as she felt bad about the raw shrimp. I always feel bad when a waitress does that as clearly the issue is the cooking staff at this restaurant. However, since she had noticed that it did not look right it may have saved her some trouble to toss it back at the kitchen staff before it came out to the table. Not sure if they have someone running the kitchen area or not but that would be a recommendation to hold the cooking staff accountable for the quality of what they're sending out - before it reaches the table. Running a successful restaurant in today's economy is quite a challenge, thus I try to weigh that reality when doing my reviews. Unfortunately, something like a foodborne illness can destroy the hard work and effort that an owner and their employees have put into building a new restaurant - so I felt that 3 stars would understate the importance of not sacrificing food quality and safety in the interest of appeasing some people who are not patient enough to wait for their food to be prepared properly. There is a lot of great food on the menu, but if someone gets sick from it all of the effort is for nothing. Far better to make someone wait and to give them a dish that has them telling their friends how great it is then to cut corners and risk of foodborne illness. It should also be noted that the staff was very friendly. However, with the Carolina Ale House being right next door I had really hoped that this would take it to another level especially when considering the prices. With tip I spent $20 for a salad. Unfortunately, the Ale House has them beat in terms of overall quality of food as I've eaten there many times and have yet to have a bad experience. A little more focus in the kitchen on the quality of the food would allow them to quickly raise the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-cary?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

The multi paged menu boasts of sumptuous dishes of a varied sorts such as deep dish pizzas, lighter calorie menu options, superfood options, Cajun varieties and more. The unfortunate part is that the food comes out of the kitchen looking nothing like the pictures or the way the menu describes. Kitchen staff on each occasion manages to omit or add something different that what was ordered.

About 15 minutes later still no appetizer, the waiter then says he is going to go check on it. Out comes the appetizer *cold as ice* and not even 2 minutes later come our entrees. Which explained why the appetizer was cold, cause it had been sitting there waiting to be brought out for a while.

We said no, there are 3 of us. She sat us, had the manager come apologize and offer a free app. The manager failed to tell the server that so he said he had to check with the manager first to see if we could have a free app. Then I asked about what the Veteran special as they were offering a free meal for Veterans Day and ensured I showed him my id then. We had two servers try and bring us other peoples orders. The calamari came out and was terrible! It was essentially fried breading with no calamari but hey it was free. The rest of the food was subpar, we also asked for ketchup and ended up getting up ourselves to ask another table if we could have theirs since it was taking so long. The check came and he took off the appetizer, but not my meal. My father asked and he said ""oh I didn't know she was a vet"", and my dad said ""she showed you her military id"".
