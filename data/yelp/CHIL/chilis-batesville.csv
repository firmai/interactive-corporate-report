Lynn S.,"Carencro, LA",0,3,,5.0,3/26/2017,"The restaurant was packed when we arrived and there was 20 people waiting and still our wait was only 20 minutes.  Our waitress, Michelle, was excellent! She was the only one working the bar area, where we were seated in a booth. She was incredibly busy, yet we were served quickly. She was very friendly and professional! Sometimes wait staff tries too hard and end up being intrusive. Michelle had the perfect balance!!  Every single item we ordered was delicious!! The stuffed chicken wings appetizer was wonderful, the quesadilla our son got was wonderful and the shrimp & chicken fajitas my husband and I got was wonderful!! EVERY ITEM was fresh and delicious!!!  Will absolutely return!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batesville
Rhonda E.,"Hernando, MS",0,2,1,1.0,9/1/2016,Absolutely disappointed by our meal. We work at a nearby hospital and have several times ordered takeout. My grilled chicken salad was mostly chicken and lettuce... What happened to the other ingredients and the dressing?  My co worker ordered quesadillas and side salad. She got hard quesadillas and about 1/2 cup of lettuce.. Again no dressing. This is pitiful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batesville
Ace G.,"Kenner, LA",75,13,1,4.0,10/5/2015,"I stop by to eat and when am on the road by myself, I usually will sit at the bar to eat. I was very impress with the service there! the bartender are very friendly and if you ask to have a certain game put on the tv, they do it with a smile. Its very nice to be out of town and be able to go somewhere and they make you feel part of the community.  I highly recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batesville
Melanie P.,"Southaven, MS",7,52,33,1.0,5/13/2015,"Soooooo we arrive and there is an empty  table just enough space for our party of 10. But Mr Tyler (host) says that it's reserved already. We were informed that if we made it there before other reserved party they would bump us up. Not so much when we arrived! As infuriating as it was, I remained calmed. Another family came in to our surprise it was the late reservation ""whom the table was being saved for"".....Well we asked the server about it and he brushed us off. We'll needless to say we chose to drive from Oxford Chili's due to the extensive wait after calling here and getting the hoooraahh...of there being no wait. Well surprise! after we arrive there is a 30 minute wait. FURIOUS! #WILLneverRETURNtoTHISlocationAGAIN",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batesville
Kimberly R.,"Jonesboro, AR",35,42,11,3.0,4/3/2016,This was more of a confusing visit than a bad visit. We didn't have to wait long for our table which was good. Our waiter took almost as long to take our drink order and bring our drinks as it did for us to sit down. Then he stopped serving us and a woman started. She didn't know our drink order so I didn't get my proper drink. My food was pretty good. My son tried fajitas for the first time and enjoyed them. My other son said that his ribs were off and ate enough to get full and wouldn't take the rest with him.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batesville
Michael D.,"Taylor, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/25/2016,"Traveling for work and stopped in for a meal. The hostess wanted to force me to sit at the tall tables in the lounge or at the bar. I came to eat, not sit at a bar and watch sports. I went ahead and sat down but never saw a server or bartender. Got tired of waiting so I left. Only get one chance to make a first impression. They lost. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batesville
Anna S.,"Batesville, MS",0,1,,4.0,5/23/2015,"I visit the bar for food and drinks regularly, and the bartenders are all awesome. They accommodate TV requests kindly.  The food is on point for a Chili's; despite being a franchise, this is probably the best restaurant in Batesville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batesville
Dalora S.,"Atlanta, GA",1,108,,3.0,1/9/2012,"The best I look for in the food of a franchise such as this is QA. It was all well-prepared, looked good, right temp, and as-ordered. The pomegranate margarita was nice and strong. The service was excellent, despite being very busy. Our waiter was a young kid who was clearly overwhelmed but still managed to be patient and attentive (even with the jerk in our party) and the manager and asst manager checked in with us and smoothed things over, even though the guest was in the wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batesville
