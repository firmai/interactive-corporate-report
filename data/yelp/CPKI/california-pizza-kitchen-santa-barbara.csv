Jade C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",560,10,5,5.0,8/19/2017,"This place is honestly so great. The customer service, the manager talks to everyone and is so cool and sweet. Their entire staff is AWESOME. The food, is delicious. The buffalo sauce cauliflower and avocado rolls are our favorite. The cucumber revival and fresh brewed iced tea are delicious. We come here all the time because it's simply great. They do a great job here and should be applauded for it!!  Also,  Our server Greg was great :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3083,6380,5218,2.0,11/16/2017,"Not a huge fan of chain restaurant food, you can really tell that it is mass produced. Service was fine, food ready quickly, but I feel the prices really don't justify the quality of the food. My salad was huge, but really anything other than healthy. The pizzas are on the small side and the noodle dishes lacking flavor. While this is a more affordable dining option that some others here, I would splurge and eat something better while in Santa Barbara, not worth returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara
Early Bird Flea Market C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",47,13,,1.0,8/15/2017,"I love the food here. I usually come to this location twice a month (and because I live blocks away from here). Everytime I used to come here, it was ok. Again food is great, but service is awful. Although, I never feel the need to complaint. Sometime 2 weeks ago, we came again, we got sat right away. But bummmm, I saw a server passing by many times and she just ignored us, I called her many times, but she just ignored us.. Such a pain everytime she was taking care of the rest of the customers and keep ignoring us. Finally someone else pass by and I called her, we waited around 30 mins to been noticed. She said sorry, I will call your server. But when she tried to call her it seems that she didnt want to take our order. Anyways at the end someone else took our order and the other girl who supposed to be our server never even say sorry or anything. She was giving us a really bad attitude, like if she didnt even wanted us there. HER NAME IS LIZ, it was the only thing I needed to know after I left the restaurant. It was very frustrating been there, and the only reason why I stay was because my daughters were starving. I would never go there anymore... Now I dislike this location. (I even called corporate) Update So I got a private message by someone who runs the yelp page (from CPK office) and trying to apologize, they ask me to filled out some info online and they were gonna get back to me. But they never did. That's how you lose customers, and end up going out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara

Johnny S.,"Watsonville, CA",86,64,32,4.0,12/1/2017,I very much thought of this place to be very good and I loved how we were seated at our table by a friendly younger boy who actually did his job very well! I loved the attitude! We were even recommended these specialty drinks they had only at the pizza kitchen I was iffy about but was NOT disappointed. The food came out great and even the simple chips & salsa didn't seem stale because have come across a majority of places that have the worst when it comes to that. The vibe was pretty friendly and our server was nice. No second guessing while we were there at all. It wasn't so busy either because it was on a Saturday. I would to like try the rest of the plates and entrees they had to offer so next time! The area seems a bit clean but not a lot of resources stocked fully when I was using the restroom. If I'm ever in the area again craving the same thing from last time I'll be back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara
Jennie K.,"Washington, DC",97,263,459,3.0,2/23/2017,"I typically don't like writing reviews that are below 4 stars, but tonight, I wasn't all too impressed with CPK.  We were seated right away, which wasn't all too surprising, considering my significant other and I came at around 8pm on a Wednesday night. We started off with the avocado egg rolls, which comprise of chicken, bacon, cheese, and avocado. Now normally these egg rolls are amazing, but it wasn't hot when we got them. It tasted it they were out for a while. Next came the waldorf chicken salad and the california club pizza. The waldorf salad was simple, but flavorful. I think there was slightly too much dressing, but that's okay. I really love the gorgonzola in the salad- paired nicely with the apples and candied walnuts! The california club pizza on the other hand... while the avocados and tomatoes were fresh, the pizza itself wasn't hot. Again, it seemed like the pizza was sitting out. The pizza itself was stale, which is really disappointing, considering I was craving this pizza tonight.  The server was okay, but she didn't ask us if we wanted dessert, which made me think that maybe she just wanted to close out and go home? I don't know- I really wanted the butter cake, but I lost my appetite once I felt like we were being somewhat rushed. Not sure how I feel about CPK after this experience. It's not a 1 star, but I was definitely disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara

Sophia D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",484,105,121,3.0,9/6/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here on a semi crowded night and were seated after 15 minutes or so.  We got seated in a very dark table and I asked if they could turn on our light but I guess they hadn't replaced it yet. It was so dark to the point I need to use my phone to read the menu.  Anyways, our waitress gave us our bread and asked us multiply times if we wanted more bread so it seemed she was overwhelmed. We ordered our drinks and it took longer than usual for her to give us the drink but I guess they were having problems with their ticket machine.   I signed up for the rewards and received a free small plate. We chose the white corn and guacamole and chips for our free plate. It was good but the guacamole and corn is very small and it needed salt.   I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and my boyfriend ordered the original bbq chicken which were all very tasty :)  Although they were many problems, I would still come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara
Gala A.,"Westlake Village, CA",145,517,225,4.0,12/8/2016,"Place is a lot bigger inside than I realized.  My brother and I stopped in here ... to be honest, I have two distinct memories of CPK.  1) The Twilight premier when I was taken here by the girl I was going with, and 2) a really awkward lunch with two people who weren't really my friends. Thankfully this experience was a lot better than the last two, because I had always thought CPK was a good ""fast food"" option, and it was affirmed going here last night. My bro and I were seated at a 2 person booth.  We were offered fresh bread.  Our waitress was really nice (don't remember her name) and attentive.  I really loved my strawberry lemonade I got, and my bro tried it and liked it too! My bro ordered a four cheese and tomato pizza and seemed to enjoy it.  I got one of their seasonal specials, a curly pasta in a mushroom sauce.  Yummmm, it was so good!  My bro kept on stealing it from me so I had to give him some. I was really pleased with the amount of vegetarian options that CPK offers.  It makes me really happy to see restaraunts who are willing to serve all kinds of customers -- especially having one of their monthly specials be vegetarian (and marking what's vegetarian with a symbol on the menu)  I know that, in the future, I will come back to CPK if it's an option in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara
Anne F.,"Dallas, TX",1,16,,2.0,10/17/2017,"the prices have gone way up I went in a month ago and it was a three ring child circus. For dining somewhere where you are going to spend 50 dollars on a chain for one person it should not be chucky cheese. The staff didn't seem to care and seated families close to me when there were other spots available. Then they send pizza kitchen emails.

Brianne N.,"Goleta, CA",4,70,4,3.0,5/21/2017,"Our server last night was horrible! I didn't get her name but she was a (white?) female with short dark red hair... She never came to check on us, I had to keep calling her over when I wanted something. She never refilled my drink even though the empty glass was at the edge of the table. Even if she was serving the table next to us, she never stopped at our table to see if we needed anything.  Because she never checked on us, we were there for a long time as there would be long periods of time where I wouldn't see her. At one point I even asked another server, Virginia, to refill my drink. Virginia was so friendly and when she brought my drink she asked if there was anything else we needed! That's all we expect from a good server- attentiveness.

Zachary H.,"Lompoc, CA",67,265,102,4.0,4/24/2017,"After a good while of trying to avoid chains I ended up at CPK, and you know what, they could be an exception to the idea that chains are bland.  It was good, real good. SO is very concerned with hygiene practices and rightly or wrongly sees corporately owned businesses as having to be held to the standards of a high visibility, as a result it can make choosing a place to eat out difficult.  So...we ended up at CPK in Santa Barbara.  Really though, I liked it, she felt comfortable and in the end that's what matters most. Jerk Chicken thin crust...good.  Sweet in the right way, tangy in the right way.  All around a good little pie.  Beer selection it's alright...could definitely use a couple more taps, and probably less Sam Adams. Service good, better than most mid level chains, ambiance definitely better than most.  Clean decor, nice airy main dining room.   Hopefully the hygiene practices fear is a passing one, but I would go back to CPK either way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara

Helen D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",459,1113,27692,4.0,5/17/2016,"Saturday night n it was busy. Still, we got a seat within 15 min. My usual order at any CPK is one of their specialty salads n jambalaya. So I got the half order of grilled veggie salad and the jambalaya (only one size available for jambalaya).... N I gotta have the olive oil on the table, I drown everything in it)... Jambalaya was delicious as always, spicy with black pepper and chunky with fat shrimps, crawfish, chicken, sausages... My BF ordered the chicken tequila fettuccine which was WOW, my new fave! Such great flavors. Our server was very good with checking on us. He was constantly apologizing cuz food was very slow to come outta the kitchen. Maybe cuz everyone was ordering pasta. The manager was also making her rounds apologizing n comping desserts and bringing out more bread. Our usual 1.5 hour dining became a 2.5 hour waitfest.

Angelica J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",50,19,6,3.0,7/6/2017,"First time at CPK in Paseo Nuevo.. They gave us quite a lot of time to think about what drinks and food we wanted to order! Food wait was quite long. Our waitress checked up on us twice... After that she disappeared and we had to ask a different waitress for more of our needs such as when we asked for more dressing for my uncle's salad the waitress we asked came passing by us with us thinking she have forgotten (because we don't see our waitress around) what we asked for because they made us wait awhile so our waitress comes to surface (Idk where she's been) came back with a dressing cup of one or two little drops of dressing and mostly added water into the dressing cup! My uncle said his salad dressing tasted like water. That was really unfortunate!!  Besides that, the food was decent as I had the Garlic cream Fettuccine with chicken and shrimp. Although I felt if I didn't add shrimp into my pasta I wouldn't be satisfied because the chicken was cut in little bits. There's was barely any chicken.. (you can see in the photo below, you'd be like I don't see any chicken.. you see what I mean!!) Anyway I've had better pasta elsewhere. I just know this time I won't be getting pasta here.

Other staff passed us by because maybe it wasn't their job.  Be warned you'll eat with plastic spoons and forks because their dishwasher is broken.

Stuti A.,"Cupertino, CA",6,11,3,4.0,5/4/2015,"Me and the roomies went to CPK for dinner this past Saturday. We had a bit of a spinach and artichoke themed dinner which we didn't even realize until the waitress was like ""wow! u girls sure are spinach lovers"" LOL! I was a bit annoyed at first because we went to CPK and put our name down and they told us there would be a 25 minute wait, so we went to Sephora to spend the time and came back 5 minutes or so before it was supposed to be our turn but then we went back up to them they said they had called our name 20 minutes ago??? That was pretty strange and so we ended up having to wait longer and the host person just came off a bit rude.. Anyway though, once we were seated our waitress was really sweet and nice and helpful so I would still say the service was generally good. For appetizers we ordered spinach and artichoke dip and the crispy mac and cheese. Both were good, but we weren't too impressed by the mac and cheese things and probably wouldn't order it again. The dip was really yummy though! Then for the entree we got a thin crust spinach and artichoke pizza and I really liked that too! My roommates mostly ordered the food because I didn't have much preference but I didn't expect to like the spinach and artichoke stuff as much as I did. I like spinach, but have never been a fan of too much cheese or artichoke in food, but it was all actually really delicious! This was definitely enough food for the three of us, we were completely stuffed afterwards. Also the price was reasonable considering!

Matt who usually works the bar is amazing and his section is where we sit if he is there. I am always surprised by people who eat out and feel it's a license to treat wait staff poorly, which is what I tend to see happen at chain restaurants pretty often. So I try to be extra nice and forgiving when things are not perfect.  It rarely happens here , but if it does , I treat the people respectfully and guess what? They happily fix it.... Today we had the rib-eye, a newer dish, and it was amazing. I am so glad they offer a meat dish, because sometimes you just want a good piece of melt in your mouth meat. The cook did an exceptional job on this dish... We also tried the new pizza that had potatoes and egg on it ( I know WTF, right??) but it was very good. We would have it again. It's great to see CPK thinking differently about their food selections because they were starting to get bland and boring...

Tamara P.,"Orange County, CA",491,715,1671,5.0,3/7/2013,"This is one of my daughter's and my favorite restaurant to dine in at.  She loves their Sedona Tortilla Soup and I love their Thai Crunch Salad.  She eats a little of my dish and I have a little of her soup, and we're both happy campers! We ate here this past weekend and can't say that we have any complaints.  The hostess was very friendly offering us a booth window.  We were happy to be able to people watch.  Lots of that in Santa Barbara!  Our waitress was very jolly immediately greeting us and offering us drinks and our menus.  Shortly after we placed our orders and received our bread.  Then right after that we received our soup and salad. The one thing that I love about California Pizza Kitchens is that everyone knows their menu who has ate at one of their restaurants and can expect that same quality of food wherever you go.  My daughter's soup was very tasty and my salad was delicious. We came around 11:30 on a Sunday, and they surprisingly weren't too busy.  We seemed to have beat the crowds because a half an hour later they really started to fill up.  At first I was surprised at how empty the restaurant was because I am always used to seeing the Hawaii ones packed to the gills along with a wait time.  I liked how relaxing the atmosphere felt in comparison to how busy California Pizza Kitchens normally are.

Food came out, instead of 1 pizza it was 2 pizza's, one half and half with random things we didn't order, one full pizza of what she had ordered. I've been to this location several times and we both always order the same thing (split a pizza), this time the waitress told me I was wrong and that I ordered incorrectly instead of fixing the issue.

Floor manager has been there way to long, and has a chip on her shoulder, never smiles, and looks like she's miserable ALL the time. Maybe it's time for an upgrade. Only thing that kept me coming back is the super nice and attentive folks at the pick up counter. But now they recently changed their chicken on some items and the BBQ chicken chopped from a rotisserie type to a charred disaster that is hard, dry, and tastes like it was literally on fire... I asked for fresh chicken, and was brought the same exact chicken that looked at tasted like it was made last week...the waitress was new and embarrassed, so had the manager come by, she insisted at my table side that it was fresh, but you could tell it was straight out of a fridge, it was ice cold, and she was so confrontational that I just let it go. At $14.00 for a salad, the chicken better be orgasmic. On the same salad they also changed the cubed jicama to this shredded limp noodle resembling, no flavor, gross, wasted money of an ingredient I've ever tasted. Been my fav salad for 10 years, and the floor manager made me feel like I was being ridiculous when I talked to her about the chicken, and jicama, that looked more like cheese than a veggie, not only that, but I asked what was in a drink before I ordered it, they failed to mention it had ginger, when I asked, the bar manager said no, it didn't have ginger after I tasted it and knew it did. Floor manager confirmed it did as I already knew, when I got the bill, both items were on the bill regardless of the fact that neither was consumed, and not even an apology. Spinach dip used to be so good, now they put it in a microwave, and it's so hard around the edges and sticky it's hard to eat, and doesn't taste good anymore.

The pepperoni had just the right amount of spice, the crust was crispy but not burnt, perfection! (On a side note, why did they change their dough recipe? I remember it used to have a touch of sweetness, which I miss. But I digress.) The spaghettini definitely benefited from the chicken & their sauce was every bit as delish as I remembered it.

The chicken was moist and tasted quite fresh, not like stuff that was kept in a freezer for a while. The dough was just cripsy and soft in the right places that I like in my pizza, and there was no need to request extra cheese or bbq sauce, as everything worked very well in terms of bringing out a fresh bbq combination.

We select a booth by a window that was just vacated. The buser walks over to us and says he will clean the table. He does and my friend and I sit down. A few moments later the same hostess who told us to sit where ever we like, rudely insists that we get up and move so she can seat another party of four. She says over and over that we shouldn't have sat down on our own and that she had a family that needs a table. Not only is she rude however she stars at us, repeatedly interrupts us, telling us to get up and go back to the front and wait for her to find us a table(in the almost empty restaurant)The people she is seating see how awkward this situation is and ask to be seated somewhere else. The hostess was on a mission to get my friend and I to move. Well move we did, right across to Eureka Burger. It's not a privilege to eat at CPK!

Amanda I.,"Kalamazoo, MI",242,358,595,2.0,8/5/2012,"I'm only going to give this restaurant two stars because I sort of like the food, especially the little appetizer plates they've started to offer. And that's where it ends. I can't give it more because of the Joe, the host they have (or hopefully, had) working as a host. And his manager, who would rather defend him and his crappy behavior than listen to a customer.  My fiance and I went on a Friday night for some dinner and told Joe we'd like to go sit at the bar. However, when we went to the bar it was full so we came back to the front so he asked us if we'd like to wait for something at the bar to open up or sit at a table. While he was asking us, another couple walked in behind us; my fiance and I barely had time to look at each other and decide, and didn't even get the chance to answer when Joe was already walking off with the couple that had just walked in to seat them at a table. WTF? Seriously, he didn't give us 2 seconds to answer before he was seating people that came in after us and when we came back we were like, ""Dude, what the heck was that all about?"" And his excuse was that we didn't have an answer for him so he decided to just seat the other couple instead.  All I could do was look at him because I was so shocked by his rudeness and stupidity. So we walked out. I called the manager because I was so put off by this man's rudeness, tone, and attitude, and all she did was defend him and tell me how he always gets high secret shopper scores. Seriously Idiot? I worked in retail and trust me, you always, ALWAYS know when you're getting a secret shopper. Secret shoppers aren't that secret because they try too damn hard to act normal, you can point them out from a mile away.  Then, on what will be my last visit ever, I had the pleasure of meeting Joe again when my friends decided they wanted to meet me for dinner at CPK. We were told by Mr. Personality himself that it would be about a 30 minute wait. So we grabbed some chairs outside and waited for 35-40 minutes, even after we noticed that people who had come in after us were being seated. And when my friend, who was recovering from having pins stuck into his broken ankle, hobbled up and confronted Joe about it, the guy flat out lied to him and told him they had come in before us. Lies, lies, lies!  So my friend with the swollen ankle being fused together by metal asked Joe how much longer it would be before we were seated, his response, after he rolled his eyes, was ""30 seconds"". Oh haha, yes, very funny.  5 minutes later we eventually had a table. And I can't really remember what I ate, or if I liked it, or what my server was like because the most dominant memory I will always have of this place is the rude guy up at the front and the management that is happy to let him get away with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=80

As our food came, they had made the wrong crust, and she was pretty bummed, so we waited for another pizza... Which she ended up getting once I had already finished my pizza. Not a huge deal, but still somewhat of annoyance.  Her mother ordered something that the waiter had specifically told her was not 'spicy'. I ended up trying it... Although not 'spicy' it was definitely 'hot', like a wasabi hot. Definitely gross nonetheless, and again, had to get another plate of chicken without the sauce.  All in all, pretty decent service for being a Saturday night. Food all in all... Meh. I'm not a huge fan of CPK. I've been here multiple times, and never do I leave feeling like I got what I paid for. I'd honestly eat at dominos if I wanted a better, more filling, cheaper pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=80
Candace Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",83,395,486,2.0,12/6/2010,"It had been years since I last ate at a CPK.  I used to eat at the one in Burbank about 15 years ago when the chain hadn't expanded quite as much, yet.   The bf and I met up  with friends at this Pase Nuevo restaurant last week for dinner.  (It was a stopover while doing some holiday traveling.)   I was a bit curious as to how the food would be.   I'd remembered the pizzas as being interesting before (if a bit weird.) We ordered a pizza and a Thai Crunch salad to share.    I liked the Thai Crunch salad.   It has way too much dressing on it, but it tasted nice (I'd order it again.) The pizza, however, was a disappointment.  The texture of the bread was bland and uninspiring.  I could make better crust at home, easily. I don't know if the quality of the chain has eroded, or I've gotten used to better restaurants for my money. Sort of a bland Boboli quality to it. At any rate, we didn't finish eating the pizza.  We'd been pretty hungry.  As soon as the salad took the edge off my hunger, I was less enthusiastic about the pizza portion pf the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=80

I wanted some pasta or Creole food but couldn't really find a place still open to dine at after late afternoon meetings. I came across this CPK while scouting out my destination for tomorrow and saw they had Jambalaya Linguini as a new item. It features ""blackened chicken and shrimp in spicy Jambalaya sauce with crawfish, Andouille sausage and Tasso ham on linguini fini, topped with scallion.""  (from the CPK menu). Aha, methinks I can kill two birds with one stone but just kind of ended up with two dead birds in hand which were not worth any that might be in any kind of bush. These are all ingredients I like but one of the challenges of these different types of ingredients is that each cooks at different rates. Like cooking cioppino, you cook ingredients at different times so that each ends up cooked through without overcooking any of it.  The chicken was pretty rubbery. It had good ingredients that just didn't come together - it was spicy enough but somehow was lacking in flavor. I also had some artichoke and broccoli soup, which also had good ingredients but again, the whole was not better than the sum of the parts.

Andrea P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,17,,5.0,6/22/2015,"OK, I am f originally from  New York and have traveled the world so I am extremely fussy when it comes to fine dining. This is not fine dining but so delicious.  I am not a lover of chain restaurants however, this place far exceeds any chain restaurant I have ever eaten in. I was fortunate enough to have been invited there on  Saturday after the  Solstice Parade by a dear friend who came from  out of town to celebrate . It was her first time in  this Santa Barbara  California Pizza Kitchen She wanted to sample many different dishes She was so surprised  by the high quality and diversity of the menu. WE ordered  many dishes to share starting  with the Maine Lobster Flat Bread , consisting of arugula  garlic oil, dill,,lemon zest, red onion and mayonnaise served on a  large crispy wonton. This dish was amazing - the fusion of flavors melted on my tongue in unison. I felt  as if  I was in The Hampton's or Cape Cod  eating one of my favorite dishes,  lobster rolls, only this was even better. It came with four large pieces to share.  We then shared a thin crust Pizza of artichokes and spinach and it was out of this world-- cooked to perfection.  It was so nice to enjoy the cheese and vegetables and not feel like we were eating just dough  It was light and lovely. Next on the agenda was a pasta dish of  zucchini ribbons and  fettuccini  and shrimp  cooked in garlic, lemon, white wine, parsley and parmesan cheese..This dish was excellent as well. The  pasta  was prepared  just as we ordered it--al dente  And the shrimp were tender It was light and we were not weighed down with too much  pasta  The vegetable was the main attraction.The menu offered many wonderful choices of: salads and  appetizers and main dishes. it was so difficult  to finalize our  order. What helped us was the expert servers and manager Angel has been there for many years we were told  we were fortunate enough to have him  attend to our table, And Beau, was equally as great The Manager has been there for over ten years, what a testament of loyalty and great achievement  He also helped explain the different dishes to us in great detail. His name is Kevin Secky. He helped us decide which deserts to order as well.  We  look forward to retuning another time to sample some other alternatives. Perhaps for my Birthday in July ,as they offer a free Sunday to the person celebrating their Birthday .Talking about deserts we had our final  splurge, we each had an amazing one and shared them also. My friend ordered one  of  the most popular ones there - the manager told us - the butter cake- served with vanilla ice-cream on top of  and whipped cream formed like billowy  clouds all around the plate. I bit into it and it tasted like I was dancing on a carousel.  He told us some people come there just for this divine desert.  I ordered the red velvet cake sitting on top of vanilla cream  with white chocolate, shavings all along the back .The cake was so light and fluffy and the cream cheese iceing was incredibly delicious. The entire cake was so large we had to take half of it home.  We thoroughly enjoyed it the next day, as we did  all our leftovers. We looked around and others were enjoying their selections as well. Many were having wine that was paired  especially for  the dishes. I had iced tea and it was never  left  empty. My friend had a mango drink she enjoyed. The other manager who is also helpful is Michele Jones  She has been there the longest and treats the restaurant like it is her very own I was told.  And The manager from Ventura fills in sometimes- Molly --and she  was there and attentive to us .   And you are greeted from  the moment you walk in by the charming  Host  Jack who says hello and seats you where you will be most comfortable. On your way out  he says"" goodbye ,have a nice day or evening .""  I know you will have a wonderful experience like my friend and I did at  The  California  Pizza Kitchen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=100

When the restaurant is set next door to a Panda Express and Ruby's Diner at Paseo Nuevo - both cheap chain food eats - I wonder how CPK can compete. Yet, it's always busy.  I avoided CPK for years, and it wasn't until it was the meal provided at a working lunch that I first tried it.  It's good, it's fine, it's definitely more creative with its topping combinations than other pizza chains.  If I had to choose between CPK and, uh, avoiding the Noid, I'll take CPK.  I ate there the other day and shared the small pizza with one other. We ordered the mango chicken curry pizza and yes, it was good.

No matter what your palette is craving in the pizza department, you can find it here.  Some words of warning, though...substitutions on pre-made pizzas and some pre-prepared dishes as I remember from a few orders are a little more than their kitchen staff can handle, so if you order a menu item rather than create your own be fully prepared to like it as large scale changes may not be possible.

We started off with the avocado egg rolls, which comprise of chicken, bacon, cheese, and avocado. Now normally these egg rolls are amazing, but it wasn't hot when we got them. It tasted it they were out for a while. Next came the waldorf chicken salad and the california club pizza. The waldorf salad was simple, but flavorful. I think there was slightly too much dressing, but that's okay. I really love the gorgonzola in the salad- paired nicely with the apples and candied walnuts! The california club pizza on the other hand... while the avocados and tomatoes were fresh, the pizza itself wasn't hot. Again, it seemed like the pizza was sitting out. The pizza itself was stale, which is really disappointing, considering I was craving this pizza tonight.  The server was okay, but she didn't ask us if we wanted dessert, which made me think that maybe she just wanted to close out and go home? I don't know- I really wanted the butter cake, but I lost my appetite once I felt like we were being somewhat rushed. Not sure how I feel about CPK after this experience. It's not a 1 star, but I was definitely disappointed.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara

It was so dark to the point I need to use my phone to read the menu.  Anyways, our waitress gave us our bread and asked us multiply times if we wanted more bread so it seemed she was overwhelmed. We ordered our drinks and it took longer than usual for her to give us the drink but I guess they were having problems with their ticket machine.   I signed up for the rewards and received a free small plate. We chose the white corn and guacamole and chips for our free plate. It was good but the guacamole and corn is very small and it needed salt.   I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and my boyfriend ordered the original bbq chicken which were all very tasty :)  Although they were many problems, I would still come back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara

Thankfully this experience was a lot better than the last two, because I had always thought CPK was a good ""fast food"" option, and it was affirmed going here last night. My bro and I were seated at a 2 person booth.  We were offered fresh bread.  Our waitress was really nice (don't remember her name) and attentive.  I really loved my strawberry lemonade I got, and my bro tried it and liked it too! My bro ordered a four cheese and tomato pizza and seemed to enjoy it.  I got one of their seasonal specials, a curly pasta in a mushroom sauce.  Yummmm, it was so good!  My bro kept on stealing it from me so I had to give him some. I was really pleased with the amount of vegetarian options that CPK offers.  It makes me really happy to see restaraunts who are willing to serve all kinds of customers -- especially having one of their monthly specials be vegetarian (and marking what's vegetarian with a symbol on the menu)  I know that, in the future, I will come back to CPK if it's an option in the mall.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara

Jerk Chicken thin crust...good.  Sweet in the right way, tangy in the right way.  All around a good little pie.  Beer selection it's alright...could definitely use a couple more taps, and probably less Sam Adams.

After that she disappeared and we had to ask a different waitress for more of our needs such as when we asked for more dressing for my uncle's salad the waitress we asked came passing by us with us thinking she have forgotten (because we don't see our waitress around) what we asked for because they made us wait awhile so our waitress comes to surface (Idk where she's been) came back with a dressing cup of one or two little drops of dressing and mostly added water into the dressing cup! My uncle said his salad dressing tasted like water. That was really unfortunate!!  Besides that, the food was decent as I had the Garlic cream Fettuccine with chicken and shrimp. Although I felt if I didn't add shrimp into my pasta I wouldn't be satisfied because the chicken was cut in little bits. There's was barely any chicken..

We had a bit of a spinach and artichoke themed dinner which we didn't even realize until the waitress was like ""wow! u girls sure are spinach lovers"" LOL! I was a bit annoyed at first because we went to CPK and put our name down and they told us there would be a 25 minute wait, so we went to Sephora to spend the time and came back 5 minutes or so before it was supposed to be our turn but then we went back up to them they said they had called our name 20 minutes ago??? That was pretty strange and so we ended up having to wait longer and the host person just came off a bit rude.. Anyway though, once we were seated our waitress was really sweet and nice and helpful so I would still say the service was generally good. For appetizers we ordered spinach and artichoke dip and the crispy mac and cheese. Both were good, but we weren't too impressed by the mac and cheese things and probably wouldn't order it again. The dip was really yummy though! Then for the entree we got a thin crust spinach and artichoke pizza and I really liked that too! My roommates mostly ordered the food because I didn't have much preference but I didn't expect to like the spinach and artichoke stuff as much as I did. I like spinach, but have never been a fan of too much cheese or artichoke in food, but it was all actually really delicious!

So I try to be extra nice and forgiving when things are not perfect.  It rarely happens here , but if it does , I treat the people respectfully and guess what? They happily fix it.... Today we had the rib-eye, a newer dish, and it was amazing. I am so glad they offer a meat dish, because sometimes you just want a good piece of melt in your mouth meat. The cook did an exceptional job on this dish... We also tried the new pizza that had potatoes and egg on it ( I know WTF, right??) but it was very good. We would have it again.

I asked for fresh chicken, and was brought the same exact chicken that looked at tasted like it was made last week...the waitress was new and embarrassed, so had the manager come by, she insisted at my table side that it was fresh, but you could tell it was straight out of a fridge, it was ice cold, and she was so confrontational that I just let it go. At $14.00 for a salad, the chicken better be orgasmic.

Been my fav salad for 10 years, and the floor manager made me feel like I was being ridiculous when I talked to her about the chicken, and jicama, that looked more like cheese than a veggie, not only that, but I asked what was in a drink before I ordered it, they failed to mention it had ginger, when I asked, the bar manager said no, it didn't have ginger after I tasted it and knew it did. Floor manager confirmed it did as I already knew, when I got the bill, both items were on the bill regardless of the fact that neither was consumed, and not even an apology. Spinach dip used to be so good, now they put it in a microwave, and it's so hard around the edges and sticky it's hard to eat, and doesn't taste good anymore. Stay away, until they get their act together, and they aren't pricing their food like they're a higher end restaurant than the Fish House or more trendy than Eureka.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=40

Our host was very friendly and knowledgable. Our drinks were constantly being refilled, our server was on top of it. I ordered the steak- and I have to say it was one of the best slabs of meat I have ever had. Literally. I think that is what I will get  this every time from now on  because it was so good.

It was about  a 15-minute wait during a Friday night dinner rush. Service was decent & I was happy to find out that bread is offered with meals. It's a small baguette, but this is a new addition that I liked. (Plus, the dipping oil with all the spices was yummy.) My hubby & I shared a pepperoni pizza with garlic & the tomato basil spaghettini with chicken breast (which was perfect for two people). The pizza was absolutely delicious! The pepperoni had just the right amount of spice, the crust was crispy but not burnt, perfection! (On a side note, why did they change their dough recipe? I remember it used to have a touch of sweetness, which I miss. But I digress.) The spaghettini definitely benefited from the chicken & their sauce was every bit as delish as I remembered it.

The chicken was moist and tasted quite fresh, not like stuff that was kept in a freezer for a while. The dough was just cripsy and soft in the right places that I like in my pizza, and there was no need to request extra cheese or bbq sauce, as everything worked very well in terms of bringing out a fresh bbq combination. Even the red onions worked added that ""crisp bite"" of complexity to the pizza.  Make no mistake, this is not a gourmet pizza, but rather a simple but great pizza that works well.

Russ L.,"Santa Barbara, United States",0,4,,1.0,23/8/2016,"Cannot remember that last time( if ever) I have had such a negative and rude interaction with a restaurant hostess. I walk in meeting a friend for lunch. As we are walking into the very empty restaurant, both us hear, ""please sit where ever you like"". Like I said the restaurant is almost empty. We select a booth by a window that was just vacated. The buser walks over to us and says he will clean the table. He does and my friend and I sit down. A few moments later the same hostess who told us to sit where ever we like, rudely insists that we get up and move so she can seat another party of four. She says over and over that we shouldn't have sat down on our own and that she had a family that needs a table. Not only is she rude however she stars at us, repeatedly interrupts us, telling us to get up and go back to the front and wait for her to find us a table(in the almost empty restaurant)The people she is seating see how awkward this situation is and ask to be seated somewhere else. The hostess was on a mission to get my friend and I to move. Well move we did, right across to Eureka Burger. It's not a privilege to eat at CPK! Whether we misunderstood the hostess in the beginning is irrelevant. You forced two patrons to leave your nearly empty restaurant because of a misunderstanding. Horrible horrible experience!

Andrea P.,"Santa Barbara, United States",0,17,,5.0,22/6/2015,"OK, I am f originally from  New York and have traveled the world so I am extremely fussy when it comes to fine dining. This is not fine dining but so delicious.  I am not a lover of chain restaurants however, this place far exceeds any chain restaurant I have ever eaten in. I was fortunate enough to have been invited there on  Saturday after the  Solstice Parade by a dear friend who came from  out of town to celebrate . It was her first time in  this Santa Barbara  California Pizza Kitchen She wanted to sample many different dishes She was so surprised  by the high quality and diversity of the menu. WE ordered  many dishes to share starting  with the Maine Lobster Flat Bread , consisting of arugula  garlic oil, dill,,lemon zest, red onion and mayonnaise served on a  large crispy wonton. This dish was amazing - the fusion of flavors melted on my tongue in unison. I felt  as if  I was in The Hampton's or Cape Cod  eating one of my favorite dishes,  lobster rolls, only this was even better. It came with four large pieces to share.  We then shared a thin crust Pizza of artichokes and spinach and it was out of this world-- cooked to perfection.  It was so nice to enjoy the cheese and vegetables and not feel like we were eating just dough  It was light and lovely. Next on the agenda was a pasta dish of  zucchini ribbons and  fettuccini  and shrimp  cooked in garlic, lemon, white wine, parsley and parmesan cheese..This dish was excellent as well. The  pasta  was prepared  just as we ordered it--al dente  And the shrimp were tender It was light and we were not weighed down with too much  pasta  The vegetable was the main attraction.The menu offered many wonderful choices of: salads and  appetizers and main dishes. it was so difficult  to finalize our  order. What helped us was the expert servers and manager Angel has been there for many years we were told  we were fortunate enough to have him  attend to our table, And Beau, was equally as great The Manager has been there for over ten years, what a testament of loyalty and great achievement  He also helped explain the different dishes to us in great detail. His name is Kevin Secky. He helped us decide which deserts to order as well.  We  look forward to retuning another time to sample some other alternatives. Perhaps for my Birthday in July ,as they offer a free Sunday to the person celebrating their Birthday .Talking about deserts we had our final  splurge, we each had an amazing one and shared them also. My friend ordered one  of  the most popular ones there - the manager told us - the butter cake- served with vanilla ice-cream on top of  and whipped cream formed like billowy  clouds all around the plate. I bit into it and it tasted like I was dancing on a carousel.  He told us some people come there just for this divine desert.  I ordered the red velvet cake sitting on top of vanilla cream  with white chocolate, shavings all along the back .The cake was so light and fluffy and the cream cheese iceing was incredibly delicious. The entire cake was so large we had to take half of it home.  We thoroughly enjoyed it the next day, as we did  all our leftovers. We looked around and others were enjoying their selections as well. Many were having wine that was paired  especially for  the dishes. I had iced tea and it was never  left  empty. My friend had a mango drink she enjoyed. The other manager who is also helpful is Michele Jones  She has been there the longest and treats the restaurant like it is her very own I was told.  And The manager from Ventura fills in sometimes- Molly --and she  was there and attentive to us .   And you are greeted from  the moment you walk in by the charming  Host  Jack who says hello and seats you where you will be most comfortable. On your way out  he says"" goodbye ,have a nice day or evening .""  I know you will have a wonderful experience like my friend and I did at  The  California  Pizza Kitchen",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=100

We sat down and I was in the mood for a salad.  The few times I do actually go to CPK, always get the Thai Crunch Salad.  CPK salads are normally way overdressed, which is not what I was taught in culinary school, but for some reason, I really like the Thai Crunch Salad in its overdressed glory. What's good about it is that it's got a TON of stuff in it.  Sliced chicken, peanuts, edamame, crispy wonton strips, Jesus' tears, crispy rice noodles, green onions, the kitchen sink, a whole side of cow, cilantro, napa cabbage, a red velvet cupcake, the cute waitress' phone number (oops, did that slip out?), and just about everything else in their kitchen.

The dates with beets and roasted butternut squash with the champagne dressing is super delicious. There wasn't much chicken, I almost missed the few pieces that were buried underneath the salad. And my favorite dessert of all time has made it to CPK, strawberry shortcake! I had to compare this to Cheesecake Factory's version and I have to say that CPK has the upper hand, warmed and soft scone with rock sugar has set this apart from CF's. I do recommend that CPK add more strawberries, you don't even get half a pint basket-it is called a strawberry shortcake. Service was good, and the staff friendly and helpful.

Lemonjelly L.,"Santa Barbara, United States",138,428,905,3.0,20/1/2008,"Is CPK trying to be fancy destination dining, or mainstream chain food. Their locations in shopping malls, their mass marketing, their uniform service all indicate mainstream chain food. But their prices say fancy dining. Something is not right. Single pizzas and salads are in the range of $12 each. When the restaurant is set next door to a Panda Express and Ruby's Diner at Paseo Nuevo - both cheap chain food eats - I wonder how CPK can compete. Yet, it's always busy.  I avoided CPK for years, and it wasn't until it was the meal provided at a working lunch that I first tried it.  It's good, it's fine, it's definitely more creative with its topping combinations than other pizza chains.  If I had to choose between CPK and, uh, avoiding the Noid, I'll take CPK.  I ate there the other day and shared the small pizza with one other. We ordered the mango chicken curry pizza and yes, it was good. But...couldn't we have gone to the local Indian restaurant, ordered a curry and spooned it onto our naan? It's the same thing.

Courtney C.,"Santa Barbara, United States",0,23,,4.0,25/6/2009,"This restaurant is the quintessential nod to California Cuisine--serving everything from a wide variety of salads and pizzas to burgers, hot and cold sandwiches and pasta dishes. If you think your favorite ingredients belong on pizza, they probably can get there at California Pizza Kitchen. Some local favorite toppings include barbecued chicken and goat cheese. And by all means,don't forget to save room for dessert so you can sample their New York Style Cheese cake or sit pretty in front of a standard but scrumptious hot fudge sundae.  No matter what your palette is craving in the pizza department, you can find it here.  Some words of warning, though...substitutions on pre-made pizzas and some pre-prepared dishes as I remember from a few orders are a little more than their kitchen staff can handle, so if you order a menu item rather than create your own be fully prepared to like it as large scale changes may not be possible.  And certainly be sure not to stuff yourself as full as any stuffed crust pizza that they might order, as you might consider taking in the carefully crafted, colorful decor that is such a dazzling surprise for their diners rather than a made dash to the dark caverns of their albeit clean and large public restroom.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=100

I got a half salad and what used to be a sizable salad is now basically a side salad. It was also $11!! For a side salad. All the prices HIGHER across the board. Ridiculous.

Amanda I.,"Kalamazoo, United States",242,358,595,2.0,5/8/2012,"I'm only going to give this restaurant two stars because I sort of like the food, especially the little appetizer plates they've started to offer. And that's where it ends. I can't give it more because of the Joe, the host they have (or hopefully, had) working as a host. And his manager, who would rather defend him and his crappy behavior than listen to a customer.  My fiance and I went on a Friday night for some dinner and told Joe we'd like to go sit at the bar. However, when we went to the bar it was full so we came back to the front so he asked us if we'd like to wait for something at the bar to open up or sit at a table. While he was asking us, another couple walked in behind us; my fiance and I barely had time to look at each other and decide, and didn't even get the chance to answer when Joe was already walking off with the couple that had just walked in to seat them at a table. WTF? Seriously, he didn't give us 2 seconds to answer before he was seating people that came in after us and when we came back we were like, ""Dude, what the heck was that all about?"" And his excuse was that we didn't have an answer for him so he decided to just seat the other couple instead.  All I could do was look at him because I was so shocked by his rudeness and stupidity. So we walked out. I called the manager because I was so put off by this man's rudeness, tone, and attitude, and all she did was defend him and tell me how he always gets high secret shopper scores. Seriously Idiot? I worked in retail and trust me, you always, ALWAYS know when you're getting a secret shopper. Secret shoppers aren't that secret because they try too damn hard to act normal, you can point them out from a mile away.  Then, on what will be my last visit ever, I had the pleasure of meeting Joe again when my friends decided they wanted to meet me for dinner at CPK. We were told by Mr. Personality himself that it would be about a 30 minute wait. So we grabbed some chairs outside and waited for 35-40 minutes, even after we noticed that people who had come in after us were being seated. And when my friend, who was recovering from having pins stuck into his broken ankle, hobbled up and confronted Joe about it, the guy flat out lied to him and told him they had come in before us. Lies, lies, lies!  So my friend with the swollen ankle being fused together by metal asked Joe how much longer it would be before we were seated, his response, after he rolled his eyes, was ""30 seconds"". Oh haha, yes, very funny.  5 minutes later we eventually had a table. And I can't really remember what I ate, or if I liked it, or what my server was like because the most dominant memory I will always have of this place is the rude guy up at the front and the management that is happy to let him get away with it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=80

Tyler C.,"Santa Barbara, United States",169,4,7,3.0,21/9/2013,"Came in on a Saturday night so it was a decently busy.  I ordered the 'new' garlic chicken pizza. It was alright, at best. The crust was subpar, and it seemed to be mostly crust. And what else is there to really say? It's garlic and chicken. You can't screw that up! :) My girlfriend ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza, on a 'regular crust' - as it used to be made before they switched to their thin crust. As our food came, they had made the wrong crust, and she was pretty bummed, so we waited for another pizza... Which she ended up getting once I had already finished my pizza. Not a huge deal, but still somewhat of annoyance.  Her mother ordered something that the waiter had specifically told her was not 'spicy'. I ended up trying it... Although not 'spicy' it was definitely 'hot', like a wasabi hot. Definitely gross nonetheless, and again, had to get another plate of chicken without the sauce.  All in all, pretty decent service for being a Saturday night. Food all in all... Meh. I'm not a huge fan of CPK. I've been here multiple times, and never do I leave feeling like I got what I paid for.

We ordered a pizza and a Thai Crunch salad to share.    I liked the Thai Crunch salad.   It has way too much dressing on it, but it tasted nice (I'd order it again.) The pizza, however, was a disappointment.  The texture of the bread was bland and uninspiring.  I could make better crust at home, easily. I don't know if the quality of the chain has eroded, or I've gotten used to better restaurants for my money. Sort of a bland Boboli quality to it. At any rate, we didn't finish eating the pizza.  We'd been pretty hungry.  As soon as the salad took the edge off my hunger, I was less enthusiastic about the pizza portion pf the meal.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=80

I wanted some pasta or Creole food but couldn't really find a place still open to dine at after late afternoon meetings. I came across this CPK while scouting out my destination for tomorrow and saw they had Jambalaya Linguini as a new item. It features ""blackened chicken and shrimp in spicy Jambalaya sauce with crawfish, Andouille sausage and Tasso ham on linguini fini, topped with scallion.""  (from the CPK menu). Aha, methinks I can kill two birds with one stone but just kind of ended up with two dead birds in hand which were not worth any that might be in any kind of bush. These are all ingredients I like but one of the challenges of these different types of ingredients is that each cooks at different rates. Like cooking cioppino, you cook ingredients at different times so that each ends up cooked through without overcooking any of it.  The chicken was pretty rubbery. It had good ingredients that just didn't come together - it was spicy enough but somehow was lacking in flavor. I also had some artichoke and broccoli soup, which also had good ingredients but again, the whole was not better than the sum of the parts.
