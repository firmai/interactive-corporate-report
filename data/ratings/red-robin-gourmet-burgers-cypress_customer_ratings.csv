334,Scott D.,"Norco, CA",3,79,2.0,1.0,2012-01-15,"Food is below average for a Red Robin, there are better ones. At our last visit, we sat very close to the kitchen area. I suspect their shift just started. The manager did this ""rah-rah"" thing for the employees where he/she gathered them all together. Fine. The problem was is that he distracted our waitress who forgot most of our order. I point it out to the waitress when the meal came and suddenly the manager is apologizing for the waitress. They tried to make it right, but frankly, too little too late. Your mileage may vary.

Bernice is always hard working and has a super positive attitude about dealing with most everyone she everyone she interacts with.  The waiters there are pretty efficient and really do not make us wait too long.  I invite anyone who gripes about customer service to try working for customers just to see how frustrating it can be.  One finds that not everyone can be made happy and are just doomed to be miserable and are rarely satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=300,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.9960000000000004,3.4000000000000004

222,Andrea R.,"Westminster, CA",319,410,1034.0,3.0,2012-10-30,"Red Robin...Hmmmmm. They know where their bread is buttered, that's for sure. Red Robin serves up tantalizing beverages for all ages-- the food is secondary. Know that going in and you're golden. At least it all looks good, like everything else here. Their menu boasts a whole lotta burgers--you'd think that's what they do best, right? That's what I assumed when I ordered the Sauteed 'Shroom, but..I caught myself thinking that Carl's Jr.'s Six Dollar Burger was much better. Not that this one was bad, but just not good enough to brag about at the top of a menu. I ordered it medium and it came cooked thoroughly, not to mention that the size of the patty was disappointing for the ten dollar price tag. Meh. Onion rings -- the breading is very thick and stiff, the better to stack into the cool tower shape. Flavor and freshness just so-so. My sweetie had the prime rib dip, my sister had the chicken wrap, the kids had spaghetti and the Arctic Cod Fish & Chips. Nobody complained, everybody ate their food -- that's about the best that could be said here, except for the fish n chips--now that was a GREAT fish n chips! I think that's what should be at the top of their menu in place of those burgers.  The one thing that was universally loved at Red Robin were the drinks. The Strawberry ""freckled"" lemonade was delicious and gorgeously presented. My sister tried a custom-blended herbal lemonade drink which I would order again for myself next time, and the man of the table went with the Salted Caramel shake. Oh baby, I could feast on that shake it was so rich and wonderful! Applebee's, TFIF's, Chili's, Red Robin...six of one, half a dozen of the other.

184,Jen N.,"Torrance, CA",130,251,1116.0,3.0,2012-11-30,"I didn't really have much high expectations for this place since I've been to so many burger spots that they all start to just taste the same. Tuesday was my first time ever eating at Red Robin and I found their food rather average as a whole. I ordered their simply grilled chicken sandwich which came with a side of (unlimited) steak fries. As a drink, I ordered their peach tea super sweetened (I shouldn't have gotten super sweetened because it tasted so strong.. so my fault here lol). The chicken sandwich was fairly good though. The meat and buns were just the right size. That and the fries I originally got with them really filled me up so I didn't have space in my tummy for more fries. But no worries there... I didn't like the fries all that much. Some of the fries I got were quite crisp, which I love! And there were some where it was crisp at the ends, but very soggy and weird at the middle portion of the fries. It was really strange, and I cannot stand eating soggy-feeling fries especially when they're thick like steak fries are. As far as service itself goes though, I give it a thumbs up. Our waiter was very friendly  and attentive. My friend hates it when nobody comes by to refill your glasses without having to ask them, and this guy came around every 10 minutes or so to check up on us to see how we're doing. But ya... it's not a place I'd go to again I suppose.

A large plate filled with fresh carrots, zucchini, cucumber, jicama and fluffy pita bread. mmmmm mmmmmmm. Another shocker for me was the kids menu, there was so much variety that my children were actually perplexed as to what to order. Thumbs up! My husband ordered the turkey burger with avocado and a caesar salad. He was actually laughing about how good it was. Of course, I ruined our family's healthy rep and ordered a beer, fish & chips (it was fantastic), but I don't care. What the heck is this? Where am I? Is this one of those hidden camera shows? We had a delicious, fresh, good-for-us meal at RED ROBIN?! Whatever, I'm coming back. Our total for all of this goodness was $48. Not bad for a family of four, drinks, apps and dinner.

231,Melissa J.,"Cerritos, CA",244,566,263.0,3.0,2013-04-29,"My review will strictly be on what I've ordered: Onion Rings - Super crispy, that kind of crispy that tears up the roof of your mouth if you eat too many.  Onions are sweet and I believe they use a panko crust for these little rings. Mozzarella Sticks - Standard and pretty much what you would expect from mozzarella sticks.  Fried from frozen, just how they should be. Chicken Tenders - These are standard as well. Royal Robin Burger - They always manage to mess up the fried egg because it is always cooked over-hard.  I don't know about you, but when there is egg in my burger I want the yolk to burst when I bite into it and ooze down the burger... food porn? This is a standard cheeseburger with a fried egg.  If you have never had a fried egg in your burger, it is time you start venturing out to new ideas. Burnin' Love Burger - I wanted to LOVE this burger, but I just liked it.  I am a huge fan of spicy and this was just about medium.  I felt like I kept wanting more of the jalapeno flavor, but with each bite it got muddled in between all the other components. Sauteed 'Shroom Burger - My favorite so far of their burger choices.  I am a mushroom fanatic and this hit the spot. Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich - I always order this with crispy chicken instead.  I have tried it as is, which is grilled chicken, and it just doesn't compare to the crispy chicken.  This sandwich is HUGE and will surely fill you up (especially after all those damn fries).  Pesto is good along with the balsamic mayo.   Caesar Wrap - Eh, I don't even know why I bothered getting this haha OVERALL:  I wouldn't classify these as ""gourmet"" burgers, but they are a tad better than most burger chains, given the variety they offer.

140,Tim O.,"Garden Grove, CA",108,510,3.0,2.0,2013-10-16,"Oh Red Robin, you have proven yourself to be a difficult adversary indeed. While this review is being written under this franchise location, I must stress that this is a blanket review, one that covers all Red Robins. Consider this an open letter, oh bird of burgers. I suppose I should start at the beginning, though I cannot for the life of me reckon where the beginning is. I have been a patron of Red Robin for many years; as far back as I can remember the gourmet burgers and steak fries have been in my repertoire of culinary expeditions. Why, just up the street there used to be a franchise, though it suffered from an affliction which could not be observed, but for the symptoms, and the empty Saturday nights eventually devoured it whole, leaving only an empty shell with a sign that reads ""For Lease"". Now, Red Robins are a trek for me. They are not far, for in truth I have gone further for less; but it is still a strain upon my soul to venture through its doors into the din of an establishment forever ensnared in a state of limbo. For you see, when I was a child I could gaze on the decor and fare with an innocence, ignorant to the truth behind each flagrant splash of Americana. And the truth of Red Robin is not that it is in need of help, but that it must have attributed its success through the sale of its soul. Red Robin is soul less, and it reeks of a corporate world that believes putting on a mask is enough to convince us. Red Robin burgers are a foul deception from the devil himself. Each one a savory journey through distinct and well-made flavor; but each time, day after day, on one end of town or another, they taste the same. The burgers touted as gourmet may live up to that title in the eyes of some, but to me they are the Stepford wives of restaurant burgers: exactly what you wanted, but systematized to the point where there is not an ounce of human inspiration in it, and it might as well be made by an assembly line of machines. And every time I take a bite and enjoy it, a part of me is eaten alive. The steak fries also tell the tale of this Faustian kitchen, bottomless like the depths of emptiness found all around you as you sit and are engulfed in noise that drowns out any atmosphere. All the free fries in the world cannot and will not make up for their real price, the price we all pay when we agree to partake in the fruit. But the real tragedy in all of this is the people. Whenever I walk in and feel the chill rush through me, my bones aching with regret, I am afraid for the poor lost soul who will be my boatman on this proverbial River Styx, for their fate must be worse than mine. It varies from meeting to meeting: some come with their own packaged, bright-eyed cheer, which is either a facade to smother the torment inside, a willful ignorance, or a brave and concerted effort to bring light into their dismal existence; others have reached the acceptance stage of their journey, and their feet carry them as slowly as their minds, crawling along at a pace of a human weighed down by the solemnity of a broken reality. Our latest endeavor brought us to Tyler, his name only known to us due to our own skills of observation, spying his nametag worn like a badge of shame halfway down his shirt. We were greeted and served with diligence in what I can only describe as being acceptably efficient, though it was a forced and placid efficiency. He would not provide us with his name, nor acknowledge he was capable of any human emotion; his mind, it would seem, was a slate, onto which Red Robin had carved their own personality, devoid as it was of all compassion. Our server bore an uncanny resemblance of a fellow human being, but all besides the basic features and a commendable, yet futile desire to push forward in his work seemed to separate him from the robin itself, which stared straight past our eyes in an unsettling, harlequin grin. That is how it was, and how it will always be; as we sit and wait, ticking our lives away in the hopes of some humanity with our meals, we will be met with nothing but disappointment.  And the bottomless steak fries only delay the problem of filling the ever-present void that comes from entering this sour tomb where all that is good and pure sleeps restlessly. Are we but the machines? Fueling ourselves for another day of grinding down our minds and sharpening our claws for the next meal?  What do we deserve and what are we given, and where does the disconnect lie? Is it with expectation? Or do we have an inalienable right to soul? Maybe it would be different if all pretenses were dropped, if Red Robin could admit that what they do they do well: assemble food to be purchased and consumed, but nothing more. We have no right to deny them the right to try and do more, but their efforts are hollow and my time grows short. Maybe one night it will resonate that I am trapped in the snare of a monster parading as a man. One day we will all succumb, and heaven help us when we do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=140,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7920000000000007,3.2000000000000006

This restaurant is in a shopping center with Costco so there is a lot of parking. We also came here with a two year old and they were very accommodating to her and provided a high chair. We even ordered a juice, but requested mostly water to be put in it and the waiter didn't charge us for it, as he understood that a two year old wouldn't be drinking much of it. The prices overall are pretty reasonable for good burgers. We ordered a Bleu Ribbon Burger and a Royal Red Robin Burger. The Bleu Ribbon Burger is a classic blue cheese burger. Lately when I've ordered these burgers the blue cheese is mild, but this one was a little more than mild, which I enjoyed! The Royal Red Robin Burger had a fried egg and bacon on top and it was awesome! The steak french fries were also golden brown, crunchy, and hot.

There's really no selling Red Robin to someone who already knows what it is. It's just so boilerplate that wherever you go, it's going to be pretty standard fare (as far as Red Robin goes). So this is based on this locations merits. For one, there apparently was an incident right before my group got there. Firetrucks and cop cars... fortunately it had no effect on mine experience. It was packed! I didn't realize Red Robin was so damn popular. Fortunately, there was a underutilized outdoor patio right outside the bar that was open seating. So score one for this location!  Service was very friendly and attentive. Not one of the members of my party needed to ask for refills on fries, drinks, or water. They were ahead of the game.

It's your typical fish burger and I do enjoy fish burgers so I did enjoy this one. The only bad thing about it to me was that it kept falling apart. Fish was falling out and it was messy to eat...unless I'm just a messy eater...But definitely get it if you enjoy fish! Endless fries! They have many different dipping sauces too so take your pick! They seem to be pretty cheap when bringing out the fries...but hey it's endless so keep asking if you want more. Clam Chowder Bowl ($6): they totally forgot to bring this out to us, but whatever...we were full anyway, but it showed up on our bill.

After meeting a friend at PSSL (see review) we decided to go to dinner!  This place was on the way and I mistakenly made a change.  I knew I could get something simi-healthy by customizing so since D didn't give a hoot we found parking and went in.   This place has ample parking as it shares a lot with Costco's but it's located on the corner!  They get rather packed but I didn't think it would be too bad being that it was a Thursday night but I was as wrong as a $3 bill.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and asked if everyone in our party was over 21.  When we said yes she said it was a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table but we could go into the bar and sit as a high table which was cool with us!  I guess this is a go to place for graduation dinners.  Go figure! She brought menus over and we started to look them over but couldn't think straight because the artic wind from the AC unit above us was freezing our brains and blasting FREEZIN COLD AC right on our table and us!  So when our server came over we asked if we could move and she didn't care! D quickly made a choice and went with the smoky, tangy bourbon-infused Whiskey River BBQ Sauce, crispy onion straws, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo.  And he went with onion rings with ranch instead of French fries and a peach tea.  D seemed to enjoy his burger and onion rings but sadly I can't say the same. I had the Bleu Ribbon burger because I wanted something that had blue cheese on it and I remember that this burger had that.  They claim that it's ""A highly prized burger"", REALLY!  Can I see the score sheets on that one?  It was supposed to have tangy steak sauce, chipotle aioli, bleu cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and crispy onions straws and be the ""envy of the state fair""!  I got it with a soy patty and a wheat bun and it came with French fries. I also got a peach and pom mixed iced tea.  The fries were good.  Nothing special but NOT dripping in grease which is a GOOD THING!  The burger was NOT what I ORDERED!  There was NO tangy steak sauce to be found or ANY blue cheese on it!  Bleu cheese is a pungent cheese NOT a mild cheese so I should have been able to taste it IF it were on my burger, which it wasn't!  They OVER DID IT with the chipotle aioli and my poor little taste buds almost got singed off!  Now I am a bit of a whimp when it comes to spicy stuff so this was a bit much for me and I have had chipotle before and did ok.   I ate the fries but ONLY half the burger and I was STARVING!  It's NEVER a GOOD sign if I can't finish my food!  I'm not sure where they are getting this,""...envy of the state fair"", madness from but that is a bit of a REACH in the WORNG DIRECTION!  And STOP saying, ""A highly prized burger"", because I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT!   The ONLY thing I was envious about were the people that made different food and restaurant choices than I did.  It was a pretty DISAPOINTING meal to say the least and left me wondering why I stop coming here?  I do suffer from CRS (Can't remember s*it) but after my experience last night the memories came flooding back like a broken NOLA levee during Katrina!  NO BUENO! The ONLY thing that was GREAT was the service.  The tea and fries were just ok.  I can't say I'll be rushing back here any time in the near or distant future!  I think the RED ROBIN has flown the coop!  A $10 burger REALLY SHOULD be ""The BOMB"" and leave me WANTING MORE not running for the door!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=80,3.24,3.23,3.23,2.248,3.234

Someone else took several orders for her because ""she was busy.""  I like teamwork- great!  Our order was the first to be taken and our food the last to be served.  Three of four meals were served warm-ish and our fries and rings were cold.  If I am splurging on fried, it's got to be fresh.  Our server sent the manager.  Just for the record, my daughters chicken fingers looked like toddler food and both halves of my husbands wrap could be skewered with one sandwich pick.  My tri tip sandwich was average. The manager sent fresh fries and onion rings.  They were great, but now most tables around us had long finished and we wanted dessert for the bday girl.  They brought a sundae, but she was set on a shake.  After being served the first dessert, we reordered two kids shakes.  All of our empty plates and baskets had been stacked at the ordering end of our table and through all the ordering and reordering, not one dish was removed.  So many menus were at the other end, that we could not keep up with things falling over on our table!  It was laughable if we had more room to laugh.  Our server walked by at least 5 more times with hands empty and never attempted to bus our table.  A bus boy was never seen, but my husband noticed the manager was hanging out in the bar through our whole experience chatting away with ""buddies."" It doesn't even matter if they were his personal friends or friendly customers, he was not taking care of his business.  Okay, I just want to go home now, but the kids husband and kids have shakes.  I'm feeling like not much of this is the fault of our waitress.  I'm thinking she is new and has little backup.  The final straw?  The salted caramel shake tasted like the Pacific Ocean and ice cream.  I had to send it back.  Blech!  It's after 9PM and we talk all the way home about how we should have gone somewhere else.  $70 dinner that was way overpriced and for mediocre food, service, and overall experience.  I won't be going out of my way to go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=200,2.84,3.16,3.16,2.504,3.0320000000000005

The bartender (Lindsey) told me that they usually do self-seating at the bar, but since today was a special occasion, I would have to wait like everyone else. Fair enough. I put my name on the list and wait it out. I wasn't even mad that they didn't take party size into account. It seemed like the guy at the front (Carlos) was just blindly going down the list. They were pretty busy. I get it. The part that upset me was that after an hour of waiting, a woman comes in, heads to the front of the line, and asks to sit at the bar.  I see Carlos point to the bar and tell her ""Yeah. Go ahead. It's open seating"" I noticed she was not on the list since Carlos did not cross any names off (not to mention I saw her come in from the parking lot.) I went up and asked him if I could sit at the bar too. I was alone and had been waiting an hour. He says there are no more seats. I asked about the seat he just gave away. He mumbled a few words and said again, ""there's no seats."" Another 20 minutes go by and he calls my name to seat me. He apologizes for the long wait. If he would have stopped talking at that point, everything would have been fine. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. I explained that the reason I was upset was that the bartender told me I could not sit at the bar without being seated there by the staff. I waited over an hour, and watched someone take the seat that I was watching. I suggested that he communicate with his staff so that they are on the same page. I also told him that I saw him seat someone who was not on the list. He got confrontational and snapped back at me, ""Who did I seat? Tell me who."" I don't know what this guy's deal is.

108,Philip V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",923,401,1528.0,4.0,2015-01-09,"No matter how many gourmet burgers I consume in a lifetime, I'll always have an infatuation for Red Robin's peppercorn burger.  For $11, you'll receive an average sized bunwich that's composed of hardwood smoked bacon, melted pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, crispy onion straws and A1 peppercorn spread generously on two fluffy onion buns.  The combination of said ingredients exude a smoky, sweet, salty taste that grabs hold of my affection to this day.  It also comes with BOTTOMLESS steak fries that are consistently fried well! Sprinkle the red robin seasoning on them and its dangerously addicting, rounding out the meal perfectly.  ----- Conclusion: There's an overwhelming amount of disapproval for Red Robin--perhaps because they're bundled with the fast food restaurants of the world.  You can't expect them to be on parr with 25 degrees or Slater's just because they claim to make gourmet burgers, but instead appreciate what they are, which is a family oriented restaurant projecting fun-flavored food.  The service is always fantastic, the menu is filled with options, and even provides well drinks and beer.  A solid 4 stars for me. Extra Notes: -Accepts credit card -Sign up for their birthday list online and receive a free burger on your birthday! -Decor is tacky, but in an amusing, care-free way -Bottomless fries! Make sure to get those delicious onion rings too! -Friendly service -Parking is never a problem -Clean restrooms",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=120,2.76,3.02,3.02,2.416,2.9160000000000004

158,Brian F.,"Reno, NV",9,15,,2.0,2015-08-16,"So let's start with why it's two stars and not one. The ONLY reason why is because we like Red Robin and we will eat there again(just a different location).  My mom was visiting from out of state and my birthday is this month so we figured we would get my free birthday burger. We arrived at around 5:30 on a Friday. We have a two year old and did not want to wait too long to be seated. Having several years of restaurant experience, I chose to arrive before the ""main"" dinner rush. We were promptly greeted and seated, but there were 5 waitresses hanging out at the hostess stand along with two hostesses. One of the waitresses complained about how slow it was and how she didn't understand why there were so many of them working. I spotted three managers, two of whom were running food and taking payments. The dining area was filled to about 70% of capacity, and I counted no less than 8 servers (plus two managers assisting) yet we had 5 different people come to our table. Our waitress took our order but we did not see her again until the very end. Different sever brought drinks, a third brought our food, a fourth refilled our drinks, and we had to ask the manager for our check when we were ready to leave. The burger ordered with a gluten free bun arrived on a regular bum and had to be sent back, the egg on the Royal Red burger was ordered over medium(which consists of a completely set egg white and partially set yolk) was underdone with the egg running everywhere. We had to ask for refills on drinks, ask to have the sauces brought out (which we had requested when we placed our food order), and we had to ask for the side of broccoli that was ordered to be brought out as it was forgotten. When we brought the general lack of care and haphazard delivery of service to one of the managers he could barely muster an apology and said something along the lines of ""well you did get a free birthday burger"" as if taking advantage of one of their promotions means we should expect to receive subpar service. Everyone has an off night, but a little empathy and a real apology would have added at least another star. I guess they're used to below average performance at this location. We'll still go to Red Robin, just another store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=140,2.16,2.79,2.79,1.864,2.5380000000000003

133,Pippi D.,"Buena Park, CA",0,29,,2.0,2015-09-01,"I have been to this restaurant many times, always for a late lunch.  After a day of packing I decided to bring my friend/helper for fish and chips, my usual order.  This was around 3:30PM, well after the lunch rush and before the Friday dinner crowd.  The restaurant was not crowded by any stretch of the imagination. After being seated we waited a few minutes for the waiter - Riley - we ordered margaritas, and since we had been sitting for a while and already perused the menu, we were ready to order.  I ordered a kid's fish and chips (basically a half order) with a side of cole slaw, as did my friend, and a short stack of onion rings.  The drinks were brought by a server other than Riley, and then we got our onion rings, also by someone other than Riley. We waited about 30 minutes for our fish and chips and when it came out, again by a different server, we got the two pieces of fish and about two tablespoons of cole slaw (another story there - barely any dressing), no tarter sauce, no vinegar, no chips.  I explained to the gal that this wasn't what we had ordered she immediately got an attitude and actually said to us ""Well don't look at me, it's not my fault.""  Really?  I try to give females the benefit of the doubt, hormones and all, but she was just plain nasty.  She then disappeared to bring us a ""side of fries.""  15 minutes later we still hadn't received the fries, tartar sauce or vinegar, meanwhile the fish is sitting on our plates getting cooler and cooler.  Seriously?  This is a burger and fries place - how freakin' long should getting fries take?  Certainly not 15 minutes.   I finally flagged down Riley - who hadn't been back to our table - no new drinks, no ""how's your meal"" no nothing.  I again explained the situation and told him that while we were waiting for our fries, our fish was now lukewarm and we wanted a refry (fresh fish).  He also copped an attitude and took our plates back.  No, ""Gosh, I'm sorry, let me fix that for you."" And he STILL didn't ask if we'd like another drink.   And there goes another 20+ minutes out of my life I'll never get back....  I flag down the manager, explain the situation and he goes off to the kitchen.  A couple minutes later the manager brings out our food.  The only problem is they didn't replace the fish. And I know this because I had taken a bite off one of the fish pieces and got the same piece back, except this time one side was soggy and the fish was rubbery, which is what happens if something is microwaved or put under a heat lamp.  I'm waiting for Riley to come around, which he doesn't (I think he was avoiding us) until another party is seated next to us.  He doesn't even glance at us or ask if the food is OK, would you like another drink, zero, zip, nada coming out of the mouth of our ""I'm Riley, I'll be taking care of you today.""  Arrgggggg.   At this point I was beyond PO'd, my face is red and I look at my friend and she's steaming as well.  We got up, went to the front to settle up for the drinks and onion rings (I'm not going to run out on a bill for something I have imbibed or eaten) and are told to wait while they get the manager.  When the manager comes I tell him about the fish being the same pieces we had sent back, rubbery, not hot, soggy, etc.  I told him we were fed up with waiting, fed up with the servers' attitudes, fed up with having to wait and wait and wait, only to get the same lukewarm fish, fed up but not fed and we just wanted to settle our drink bill and get out.  He offered a couple of times to get us food to go which was very kind, but I wasn't about ready to wait another half hour.  He did give me a couple of cards good for appetizers, and insisted on taking care of our drinks.   I will be back because I love the RR fish and chips, and I'm hoping this was was just a bad day, but I absolutely will not sit in Riley's section and won't wait so long to leave if something like this happens again.  On a good note, the manager was great and I hope he chewed out a couple of people.   BTW, we ended up at California Fish Grill, which was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=100,2.16,2.74,2.74,1.9280000000000002,2.508

162,Nicole G.,"Seal Beach, CA",14,24,8.0,1.0,2015-09-04,"Didn't even eat here because after 45 minutes they couldn't seat our party. We were told when we arrived we could expect a 15 minute wait.  25 minutes later we were told the ""smaller parties"" in front of us would be seated first since there was ""no way"" to accommodate our two high chairs at those tables. I told Tara the hostess that the children could both sit in regular chairs then and she said that ""wouldn't make a difference."" From a practical aspect - then we were a party of 5 and a party of 4 wanting to sit at adjacent tables. And if the only reason they couldn't accommodate us was the highchairs how could that not make a difference?  After 35 minutes and 5 families of 4 or more later ... We asked the other much less rude hostess how much longer we could anticipate waiting. She stated they were waiting for a party to finish, apologized, and stated we would be seated any minute. We were just about to wait until Tara then immediately seated a party of 7 (we were 9 - remember with 2 being either high chairs or regular chairs which could be added to the end of tables). I explained to Tara that they had seated so many parties in front of us that they didn't need to ""wait for a table to open up"" we could have sat at one of them and that it wasn't okay to seat immediately a party of 7 when we had been waiting over 45 minutes and after 8 families, she actually RAISED her voice at me and snapped, ""well they had less people then you"" We left because I was shocked by her rudeness and my son asked me ""Why did she have to be so mean?"" Since 7 families all of at least 4 people were seated prior to us - it was clear they were isolating one specific table and waiting for that party to leave. When multiple spaces with two tables along side one another (which would have been fine) were turned over as we waited.  So when they could have easily accommodated us had they not put those guests ahead of us ... Tara didn't understand how to prioritize seating. I hope they offer their hostesses retraining, we've just moved to the area and would have enjoyed this as a place to have a family dinner but will not being returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=160,1.96,2.71,2.71,1.8920000000000003,2.41

They did send me a $15 gift card after my spoiled catsup incident that I decided to activate it last night. The place was packed. We were seated quickly and we did sit for 8 minutes until a person walked up explained he wasn't our server but would get our drinks. We then sat for 6 more minutes. They have a new device in the table and I asked my BF if he thinks we are supposed to push the call waiter button.  Finally our server walked up and apologized for the wait and said she will take care of us from here on out.  I got the new johnsonville brawtworst and had some items on the side but and added grilled onions instead of raw and it was amazing. It's a temporary menu item but I hope they put it in the menu. My BF got a burger and the bottomless root beer float and he was happy. Our server check many times to make sure we were ok and made sure his float was full. All and all it was a huge difference from the past five plus times we have been. Those others were all bad but we will make it a point to come back and try it again. We paid using the new devise and that was nice not having to wait for a check.

That's what I enjoyed in my latest visit there! I am a fan of their steak fries, esp. when they come out really hot and crispy + sprinkle their seasoning! So yummy! I noticed that they now have garlic fries that you can substitute for $0.99 extra so I thought I'd give it a shot. It was actually a terrible idea! It was not good at all. They just sprinkle garlic powder over the regular fries, some pre-shredded Parmesan cheese, and sprinkle some parsley (I couldn't tell if they are dried parsley or fresh one :0) Nothing fancy and didn't really make it gourmet either. A little disappointed but that's ok, I'll just stick to what I like and what they do better - the regular steak fries.

60,Randal S.,"Long Beach, CA",8,23,28.0,4.0,2016-02-25,"Overall: 4/5 There's a lot to like about this location with their spacious parking, cool waiting area, friendly hostess, and delicious burgers. Unfortunately, our waitress seemed to be racing between her tables, dropping off food and drinks without even slowing down, which made it almost impossible to get her attention and definitely brought down an otherwise delightful meal. Service: 3/5 The service here was about average. I have been to other Red Robin restaurants and have had much better service than what I experienced at this particular location. The waitress was very friendly and pleasant, but seemed to be going at a 100mph the entire night....granted she seemed to be very busy, but when your waitress is dropping off food and drinks on her way to another table without even breaking stride or allowing you the chance to ask for something else, it kinda gives you a rushed feeling and makes your dinner a little unpleasant. Many time we were left waiting for her to make another sprint around her tables for us to have a chance to hopefully get her attention to ask for more drinks or fries...most of the time unsuccessfully. Aside from our waitress, the people delivering the food were very pleasant and helpful. The hostess was also very welcoming and friendly...she even rushed to open and hold the door open for my wife who was on crutches, which I thought was really sweet. Cleanliness: 5/5 The restaurant is very clean. I particularly liked the waiting area with the awesome ""burger chairs"" and the chalkboard to keep my 2yo entertained. Parking is a breeze since they share their massive parking lot with Costco. Food: 4/5 The food is pretty standard for a Red Robin except for the fact that my burger was a tad dry (not a big deal) but still delicious. If you haven't been to a Red Robin before their burgers are their signature (can't go wrong with my fav: the peppercorn burger) with all-you-can eat steak fries (regular or garlic Parmesan). I also enjoy the crispy onion ring tower. The kids menu is pretty great with some unique selections like the meatball lollipops (which my son loves) and chicken stickens (grilled chicken bites on sticks) to go along with the tried and true hamburger, pizza, corn dogs, Mac and cheese, etc...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=60,2.6,2.46,2.46,2.7359999999999998,2.516

97,Kristina O.,"Cypress, CA",98,349,45.0,3.0,2016-03-06,"As yelp says an ""A-OK"" burger spot in Cypress. They are known for their bottomless french fries (when you can grab your server to refill them) and the free birthday burger deal (you can sign up on their website).  I've had good and bad servers here. The good ones are always super prompt, make sure you have refills, and make sure that you have everything you need. The bad ones don't even check up on you and bring the check before you're even done with your meal. Regardless, I still come here on occasion when they come out with new burgers that sound good or if it's someone's birthday. Your safe bets when you go to red robin include the following: -the bleu ribbon burger - tangy steak sauce, chipotle aioli, bleu cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and crispy onion straws on an onion bun. -Sauteed mushroom burger - mushrooms sauteed with garlic and parmesan and melted swiss cheese -Tavern double - two patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato (there are other variations that are spicy and have bacon) I have found that their guacamole bacon burger usually doesn't come with enough guacamole on it to even have a detectable guacamole flavor. Additionally, their more expensive ""finest"" burgers are really messy, especially the black and blue burger, which I couldn't even pick up without it spilling everywhere. Their alcoholic drinks are generally good here and are on the stronger side. They are also cheaper, especially compared to other restaurants in the area. Their alcoholic milkshakes are really fun to pair with a burger, and they also have a variety of specialty non alcoholic drinks for kids as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=40,2.6,2.46,2.46,2.604,2.516

The wait was 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon.  We thought it would be pretty busy, but when we were seated we noticed that more than a few dozen tables were empty.  So, not sure why the long wait. The service was just so-so.   We go out a lot and I don't remember in our recent dining experiences service so bad.  The water served to our table tasted like dish soap.

I used to love Red Robin.  In fact it was my favorite restaurant when I was a kid.  I would always pick it for my birthday dinners.  For a time this corporate franchise was holding it down amongst the huge influx of trendy restaurants.  Im not frou frou, give me a solid burger and those endless steak fries with a side of ranch and I'm golden.  Not sure if it is just this location or if the quality and size of the burgers have gone down everywhere, but my once loved favorite Whiskey BBQ Burger has certainly diminished.   I came to this location once before and the wait staff was terrible but since I love Red Robin so much and this one is so close to my house I decided to give it another shot.  The second time was just as disappointing.  Our server was okay, not very attentive, and fake friendly.  We waited over 25min for our food, not good but not awful I guess.  The restaurant was not at all busy (surprise surprise).  I used to get some of the best service ever at Red Robin (obviously not this location).  I even remember telling a waiter that he was the best server I ever had!  What happen to those people?? Baby come back! Guess those days are over.  You can't say I didn't give it a second chance!  Red Robin, after a 20+ year love affair, I think we should see other people.  We had a good run.  It's you though.

Finally he came & said  I will just take utensils & I will come take your order. Well he came after 2 minutes with no utensils or napkins at least. I wanted a root beer float & he said they didn't have it tonight. My son asked if we can have fries to start, he brought us a very cold sweet potatoes instead which we didn't want to eat. He brought our orders . They looked ok but my fish & chips was so oily, dark color like it was soaked in an old oil. I thought it was burned but worst it was so saggy barely cook, you touched it & it pulled apart. We have our food & still no utensils or napkins. I had to ask for   anyway I tried to wipe it with a napkin  & you can see the old oil they cooked from. He came back to check if we are deliciously enjoying our   I showed him my food.

My order arrived on the wrong type of bun.  When I pointed out to the server that the bun was not what I ordered, he annoyingly said "" I don't know if we have the kaiser rolls since we discontinued the burger it came on""....what?  I have ordered my burger on the kaiser bun since Red Robin began offering them (it has literally been years) - including last week at this very location.  He ran back to the kitchen to check and a few minutes later came back and said they did have the rolls did I want him to change it out....isn't that why I pointed out the mistake in the first place.... I said yes.    My burger came back on the correct bun but had more mayonnaise then I have ever seen on a burger...it must have had at least 2 1/2 tablespoons plopped on the top.  When I asked the server if the burger looked correct to him because if is the burger I always order and it had excessive amounts of mayo.  He told me it has always come that way.  When I told him that I order it all the time and it has never had this much mayo, he argued with me and said I was wrong that it has ALWAYS been saved that way ALWAYS!

I must say I've had multiple mishaps at this location on previous visits but still decided I needed some ""bottomless fires"". We were seated as soon as we walked in and helped almost immediately but service went down very soon afterwards. We ordered and I asked if we can have some fries while we waited. They dropped off some garlic fries and we devoured them and waited basically until our food came and was ignored multiple times when we would of liked more. We ordered a salad and a garden burger, 100% my mistake I thought the garden burger was something else other than a veggie burger, so again waiting for an unnecessary amount of time when our waitress did walk by us multiple times before even asking us if everything was ok or if we would like a fry refill or drink refills. My boyfriend finished his salad before she walked over, so once she did I expressed my sadness that I didn't want a veggie burger I just wanted a plain ole cheeseburger. The only upside of that visit was that they had no issue swapping out my burger needs. Another 10-15 minutes or so and the cheese burger was dropped off with more fries, but again very awkward that I was sitting there waiting to flag down someone to tell them I would like to order something else and to ask if we can get a refill. I started to eat the burger which surprisingly was very delicious, it wasn't dry and had very yummy crispy shredded lettuce on top of the patty. So I reached over to take a nice big gulp of my beverage for it to still be empty and to notice that my ""bottomless fires"" were  also empty. It's literally the most uncomfortable situation to have to eye flag down someone to get attention, it's almost like they purposely avoid you. To avoid sounding like a horrible inconsiderate person, the restaurant was not busy, and if it were I would completely understand the lack of said service. Also in the middle of trying to make any type of eye contact with LITERALLY anyone who worked there; this extremely awkward person came us to with a half ass sales pitch to donate to some type of organization that Red Robin teamed up with. So verbatim ""Hi we have a fundraiser happening today, uhhhhaa ummm want to donate?"". With not knowing what organization this was with the lack of information this awkward person presented to us DURING our meal we politely stated that we didn't have any cash and did ask her if a donation can be added on to our bill she again lacked information and said she would ask and she was not seen again. So I have multiple issues with this,1. How is corporate ok with people coming up to customers during your meal to try and get cash donations when there is a booth in front of the restaurant also supporting this unknown organization? 1  1/2 DURING YOUR MEAL?!?! During the time I'm trying to savor my ""bottomless fires"" DURING?!?  2. This chick didn't know what her sales pitch was and lacked the information I actually needed to want to donate. 3. How is it that our waitress was missing and couldn't be located but this random Red Robin employee had time to go up to every table with her half ass sales pitch? In a nutshell, you won't get ""bottomless fires"", refills, service and you will get awkwardly approached by staff for other reasons. And I say other reasons because I'm still not sure what that lady was trying to us to donate to. 91 of 100- 2016 Yelp challenge",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=20,2.32,2.37,2.78,2.3120000000000003,2.35

I went to dinner with my husband the other night (Wednesday night) and we were seated immediately. We were seating at a lopsided table in the middle of a room with multiple big parties surrounding us. It was loud but no big deal. Then we waited.....and waited....and waited...no one seemed to want us as their table. I saw multiple people check on their tables multiple times before ANYONE even acknowledged us. If my husband was not so adamant about getting his chicken wrap, we would have left. There is no reason for customers to sit and wait for their server to acknowledge them. We didn't even get the ""I'll be right back to help you"", we just got ignored.  When our server finally helped us we were ready to order everything.

One of the places we frequent is Red Robin. We love this particular location and many of the servers there. The burgers are fabulous as are the soups and salads. We have, had an off night on occasion but most of the time our expectations are exceeded. One of my favorite burgers is the Banzai. It's deliciously prepared with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and grilled pineapple smothered in teriyaki sauce. Of course, they have a chicken version of this as well, for those who don't like red meat, and it is equally as delicious. The tower of onion rings is a great appetizer. For those of you looking for something a little lighter, I've had all of the soups and salads and cannot complain about any of them. The Chicken Tortilla Soup as well as the Clam Chowder are both fabulous. As for the salads, my top three would be the Southwest Chicken, the Avo-cobb-o, and my favorite the Apple Harvest. My 5 year old son loves the kids meals, especially the Mac It Yours (Mac N Cheese) and the Chicken Stickens and my wife's favorite meal is the Clucks and Fries (Buzz style).  Most importantly though are the servers. Always pleasant and helpful. Tara, Brayden, John, and Jasmine are our favorite servers. They are always cheerful and try to take care of us to the best of their abilities.

59,Scott R.,"Stanton, CA",14,1,,1.0,2017-04-23,"Something seriously bad is going on at this Cypress Red Robins...last night (4/21) my wife, my son and I went to this restaurant for the first time...the first time we've gone to a RR.  We ordered three burgers, one with clam chowder, one with endless steak fries and mine with onion rings.  We all shared these foods between ourselves.  The burgers were good, the onion rings were good, the clam chowder was OK and the fries were cold and under cooked.  My son had a coke and my wife and I shared a blended strawberry Margarita.  We were half way done with our meal when my wife started feeling bad...I asked her what's happening... She said she was feeling light headed and dizzy and her chest was feeling heavy...I monitored her for a minute, she started feeling a little better then she started getting worse.  She asked to give her the keys to the truck.  I had my son walk her out to the truck...she was very wobbly and had to hold on to my son as they made their way outside.  She just wanted to leave so I, being left at the table, wanted to get the bill and get my wife home.  At this point I don't know the condition of my wife outside but I'm concerned.  I try to find our server so I can box everything up and pay the bill.  It's at this point that I start feeling light headed and feel like I might black out.  I couldn't find our server but did see the manager a table away setting it up.  I expressed to her that I wasn't feeling well and that my wife was outside feeling the same.  She asked if I wanted her to call 911...I said yes and then said that I needed to lay down on the floor next to our table.  This is when the spectacle started.  I've never had to lay down in the middle of any establishment.  The police and fire came and asked all the pertinent questions... ""What's your name, date if birth, do you know where you are...count to four backwards"".  At this point I'm starting to feel better all by myself and answer all questions with no problems... I'm more concerned about what's happening with my wife outside and I'm asking everyone to please go see if my wife is ok....they found her in the truck and she was feeling better.  The EMT asked if I wanted to go to the hospital and I said no...it was Friday night, the ER was the last place I wanted to go till 2am and beside everything was subsiding. I needed to go outside and find my wife...I found her with EMT in the truck, she was fine as well.  We signed off with EMT and paid the bill then left for home.  So, here's the reason I'm writing about this...we all shared the food between ourselves... The only thing my wife and I shared exclusively was the strawberry Margarita.  We continually kept telling EMT and the manager that we believed there was something wrong with the Margarita...to my continued amazement no one really wanted to care or think that that should be a concern.  EMT was doing their job, seeing if I wanted to go to the hospital or not and the manager was only concerned about getting me out of the restaurant and then paying the bill.  This experience was embarrassing and I did just want to go home and so did my family.  We paid the bill, all the while, reiterating the idea that something was wrong with that drink. The manager, blonde full figured, insisted on telling us that their products were gluten free and not wanting at all to accept any responsibility for my wife's and my symptoms that were the same and that subsided at the same time...she would not even entertain the idea that something could be wrong with that drink.  When I woke up this morning the first thing I did was to see if there were any yelp reviews about this store like my experience... I found none but did find many bad reviews. My only thought about this is to warn others.  I'm just glad it wasn't worse.  Unfortunately I can never know what was inside my wife and I because we didn't go to the hospital but it is something that's lingering in us a day after.  Be careful going to this Red Robin IT'S NOT SAFE... I think its safe to say we won't be experiencing a RR any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=80,2.6,2.59,2.704,2.468,2.5940000000000003

78,Vivian L.,"Long Beach, CA",4,9,5.0,1.0,2017-06-01,"Let me preface this by saying this is my first ever negative yelp review.  I ordered a salad and the salad had a lady bug in it. I work in a restaurant, this kind of thing is basically unavoidable and will happen once in a while, I get it. However, my issue was with the way this was handled. When I notified the server she was apologetic, which I appreciate, but she didn't remove the plate. Why would you leave a plate with a bug in it in front of a customer? After about 10 minutes the manager comes over and asks if there's anything he can do. Why should I be thinking of what you can do for me? I'm not managing the restaurant. Then he elaborates and offers a free appetizer or dessert which I declined. Then he walks away and still doesn't take the plate! As someone who has worked in the food industry for many years, that's customer service 101! If someone finds a bug you take the plate immediately and comp it, no questions asked. The manger then took $4 off the salad. I honestly can't believe I just paid for a salad that had a bug in it.

What a change! They've gotten much better! . I ordered the A.1.® Peppercorn Gourmet Burger, which comes with Bottomless Steak Fries. The online menu description says: ""Gourmet burger joint or five-star steakhouse? It gets confusing with the hardwood-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack, A.1.® Peppercorn Spread, tomatoes and crispy onion straws on an onion bun, making this burger worthy of five stars"".  When I read ""worthy of five stars"", I thought, ""Yeah! Right! This, I've got to try!""  . My waiter, Tyler, and I got off to a shaky start after he delivered the food. I was disappointed, because it seemed larger in the menu than what I was getting. I think I made Tyler a little nervous, because he came back a minute later and asked me if everything was alright, and I nicely told him that it wasn't quite what I expected, because, somehow, I thought it was going to be larger.  . Tyler had a professional attitude. He apologized and asked me to taste it and offered that if I still wasn't satisfied, I could try something else that I may like better. I was very impressed with Tyler's professionalism, as it's not very often nowadays, so I changed my mind about just eating it and never coming back. I decided, instead, that I would eat the hamburger, and if I didn't like it, I would come back another time to try something else, because I liked the service I was getting. . Tyler did something else that impressed me. When he first took my order and asked me if I would like something to drink. I said water, because I didn't feel like drinking a soft drink at the moment. Being professional, he didn't give me a sour look, as I get from some places. Instead, he impressed me by asking if I would like a sprig of lemon in it, to give it some taste. I love lemon in my water, but never think to ask for it. I thought it was a nice touch that he would smile and ask if I would like the sprig of lemon too.  . The store menu is slightly different, and mentions that it is made of Black Angus Steak. That's better meat than what you get at regular burger joints. One bite and I could taste the difference! And with the A.1.® Peppercorn Sauce they cooked it with made it mouth-watering delicious! I couldn't believe how good a burger could taste.  . They call it a gourmet burger, and they have earned the title! It is so scrumptiously delicious, if I were with a date, I think I would have forgotten about her as I devoured it, salivating at every bite and thoroughly enjoying my gourmet burger. She could've ""flashed me"" and I wouldn't have noticed! Not now, honey! I'm enjoying my Red Robin gourmet burger! . When I was done and asked Tyler for the check, I asked to see the menu too, and he very graciously brought it with no questions asked. Then, I opened it and asked him to discuss it with me. He was very polite and listened as I saw why I was disappointed and discussed it with him. He said, upon seeing the larger than life picture, now he could see why I would be disappointed when I saw that it was just a regular sized burger, because the picture makes it look so much bigger. But it tastes so good! They just need to fix that picture, so they won't throw off other customers too.  .  Another thing I was disappointed with, was that there was just a handful of steak fries on the plate, with the hamburger. That was disappointing after I had read that you get bottomless fries, yet that was all they delivered. However, when I was quickly finished with my fries, Tyler asked me if I would like some more. I said yes, thinking I was going to get another handful of steak fries. Was I surprised! He brought back, not a plate, but a basket, that was filled with steak fries! So many I could hardly eat them! . I left, a very happy customer. I was stuffed, it was mouth-watering delicious, I had savored every bite, and Tyler was very professional--being very polite and courteous.

This is the 2nd time this location has been rude like this. Never eating here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=20,2.6,2.64,2.66,,2.624
5,Elyse B.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,16,12.0,2.0,2017-11-10,"So it's pretty nice eating there, but don't order to go. I paid extra for the fries to have the garlic/cheese on them and it was the saddest thing I've ever seen for $1.29 extra. Plus my burger was soggy and had no jalapeños in it. Also, my dad ordered extra fries and got the same sad amount of fries that I received. Don't order to go only dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress,2.64,2.64,2.652,,2.64
2,Bee F.,"Bellflower, CA",1,29,14.0,1.0,2017-11-19,"Very disappointed with Red Robin!   I went to Red Robin for the first time tonight with my family.   We waited approx 15 minutes before being seated, which wasn't to bad.    The waitress took our order approx 5 minutes later.   There were 3 people in our party and we didn't order anything out of the ordinary.   We waited at least 30 minutes for our order.    I requested no onions on my burger.  When our order arrived everything was cold!   I requested more fries since the fries on my plate were cold.   I was willing to eat the burger, although it was cold, until I noticed there were onions on  the burger!!  Come on.... it wasn't a huge request, right!? My Mother in law ordered the chicken wrap And soup, her soup was cold and wrap was soggy!!    While our food sat in the window waiting to be delivered the waitress decided to sing happy birthday to a customer, take the check for another table and THEN delivered our food ..... without giving us any napkins....how can you eat a burger with no napkins?! Don't think I'll be dining at Red Robin again!  Not a good first impression!  :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress,2.48,2.62,2.644,,2.564
69,Nicholas J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,2.0,2017-11-27,"It's been years since I've been to a Red Robin and I don't recall much about my last visit but over the weekend I did go to one on Katella Ave in Cypress. I ordered the Red's Tavern Double featured on a banner at the entrance for $6.99. It comes with endless fries, I also ordered a soda and a cup of clam chowder. The pictures all look great in the menu but like any menu it's hard to tell the actual size. This is where this eating experience takes a turn for the worse. The server was very polite and took our order promptly and brought us our beverages. We all ordered a cup of the clam chowder for $3.39, what a let down, it was the smallest cup of soap I've ever been served... maybe 5 ounces. Tastes wise it was OK nothing special. The Tavern Double is in the same boat as the soup, it's more of a kid's burger and as for the endless fries... well the server didn't come back until after we were done eating to ask if anyone wanted more fries... kind of late on that one. So for roughly $16 (including a $2.00 tip) I got a tiny meal that was so so... the four of us in my group all agreed that the food was not that good and the portions on what we ordered were too small... reminded us all of like kid's meals. So perhaps that's why I haven't been to Red Robin in years but now I know and I won't be going back in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress?start=60,2.48,2.59,2.636,,2.5460000000000003

10,Julie C.,"Buena Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-08,My son and I went into this Red Robin for dinner and he asked for a well done burger due to a health condition. His burger comes out pink which he took a bite of . We mention it to the waitress and she says they will get a well done burger for him. They come back later and bring him the burger! We had to hunt the manager down at this point and she acts like we are crazy and says it was not the same burger which had the same bite my son took out of it..! Rather than argue we will not be returning to this Red Robin!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress,2.44,2.59,2.624,,2.5300000000000002

Food is generally quick to arrive (looking at around 15 minutes, sometimes less), staff are very friendly and make sure to get your order down right. The restaurant is also very clean. I just did my first To-Go order recently and they made sure we saw our order first before we took it, including checking to see if the fries were warm enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress,2.48,2.59,2.64,,2.5460000000000003

He was fast accurate and extremity friendly. Red Robin should hire more servers like him because he represents the organization phenomenally. I hope the management team at Red Robin takes the time to commend him on the superb job he is doing. I will definitely be coming back because of the great service.

1,Ruby V.,"Buena Park, CA",559,128,560.0,1.0,2018-01-02,"Don't come here...I don't know why I keep coming back to this place and why it took me so long to finally write a review for this particular Red Robins establishment; but today at 3:30pm, was my final breaking point.  My family and I walked in and noticed that this place wasn't busy at all. Besides their bar area, with about 5 customers, their dining area was pretty much empty. We didn't see a host or hostess at the front, so after waiting for about 5 minutes, we actually had to track down the hostess, she was in the kitchen for some reason, but we finally got seated. I had a feeling this was going to be a bad experience already, so I set my timer to see how long it would take the waiter/waitress to at least get our drink order. We noticed 2 workers setting up some tables and majority of their staff just chatting away and laughing in the kitchen. At the 15 min mark of waiting with not a single person coming by to take our drink or appetizer order; my family and I just got up and walked out. Before I walked out, I asked to speak with their manager (their manager at that time was Gus),  I told Gus that he really needs to step up their customer service, because this was just ridiculous. All he could say was sorry for the bad experience and went back to the kitchen. I just don't understand, their restaurant wasn't even crowded or busy, and they clearly had enough staff members.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress,2.68,2.62,2.64,,2.644

Today I had the Gourmet Bacon Cheeseburger and last time I had their basic Red Robin Cheeseburger. Endless steak fries are endless!! I would say my burger today was better than the basic burger but both were good. Topped it off with a beer and we left rolling out the door. Will definitely be back.

4,Le B.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,5,,1.0,2018-01-13,This place doesn't even deserve 1 star! We came in at 11:15 am on a Saturday morning. The place was pretty empty since it just opened. The guy at the front said that we had to wait for a bit because all his servers were taking care of big parties that just came in before us. We ended up waiting for about 15 minutes to get seated and finally left. I don't understand why they  dont have enough staff for a Saturday. There were only a few parties that were seated in the restaurant and couldn't seat us because the few servers that were working were already helping the other parties. This was not our first bad experience here. We've come often on weeknights. We always end up waiting 20 minutes before someone even takes our drink order. We came Saturday when it opened thinking that we probably won't experience this problem but we couldn't even get seated!  The management at this location is terrible we probably won't be back again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cypress,2.68,2.6,2.632,,2.632

We came in with a large party and they were super busy, but we were willing to sit on the patio so they accommodated us. The server Caitlyn was quick and on top of it! She kept up with drink refills and 8 kids asking for side refills. She was very pleasant and great with the kids. Our food came fast, the kids first, that was great!
