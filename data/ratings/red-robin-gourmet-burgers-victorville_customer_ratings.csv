99,Ida P.,"Colton, CA",1,13,11.0,1.0,2012-07-24,"I've been to several Red Robins, but this one is the worst thus far. Not only was their gluten-free menu outdated by several months, but the servers had no idea what requirements are necessary for prepping a gluten-free meal. I ordered a burger without a bun, but my burger came with the bun intact. When I sent it back, instead of receiving a new order, the bun had simply been removed. I could tell because there were traces of bread stuck to the lettuce. Normally I would have returned it a second time, but because of time constraints and hunger, I took off the outer layers of lettuce and ate the ill-prepared burger. Needless to say, I became ill almost immediately after and for several days following that meal. I wish I could say the service was so poor because it was packed, but there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant; we went on a Thursday around 3 in the afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=80,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005

The decor here is way different than other Red Robins, this one is newer but went for a vintage look with old movie posters and the old logo, not really feeling it. The whole place feels cold and there are so many too small booths, even though I doubt this place really fills up. We went for Jim day since my husbands middle name in James, he got a free Jim Beam burger. It didn't come with any sides, so he ordered the pound of spuds app which turned out to be just a basket of fries, I should have known but was expecting something better. He also got the california chicken sandwich but asked for it fried. The burger was ok, the chicken not so  much. I split two kids meals with my son, the veggie and the boca burgers, since both of those on the kids menu cost the same as the exact same thing on the adult menu. Both were gross, I have had boca and gardenburgers before but these tasted raw and stale, with no flavor whatsoever. The service was pretty much lacking, we had to flag her down for a refill and didn't even bother to ask for a second one. Same with the fries, I asked for a refill twice just to get one basket with about 5 fries for the 3 of us when we were finished eating follwed by the question if we are saving room for dessert, no, well heres your check.

He took the kids orders first and did a great job of getting it in.  However, their drinks came out separately.  Some came from a drink station (first), the rest came from the bar.  This gap was separated by at least 10 mins.  Made for unhappy kids (""why did she get hers first..."").  He came back and took the adults orders and drinks.  Most RR would bring out the fries first (since they are bottomless)...we didn't get our fries til after our entrees came out.  When the kids food came out, there were a few mistakes.  NO big deal though.  Biggest deal was the delay between food (since he was the only guy bringing it out).  I can't blame him for our experience, but I expected more from RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=40,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

Servers always seem rushed or stressed or something.  Can't quite pinpoint it.  None of the old wait staff transferred to the new location.  Unfortunate because they had several great waiters/waitresses.

I got a ""black & bleu"" burger, which is one of their ""premium"" burgers. Not impressed. The amount of bleu cheese was minimal and was overshadowed by the pile of grilled onions and mushrooms (anytime bleu cheese plays third fiddle on a dish with bleu in the title, its a bad sign). My daughter had one of the eight actual dinners on the menu; riblets with mac 'n' cheese. She liked it, but didn't love it.  Service was excellent, and there was no wait to seat our party of eight on a Friday evening (you can draw your own conclusions about that).

30,William W.,"Adelanto, CA",0,8,,3.0,2015-10-12,"Nothing has ever tasted ""badly"", but nothing is ever too far above ""average"", and if it weren't for bottomless fries (If/when they are a fresh, generous portion) there are far better places to eat the same type of food for the money. For burgers, as this is the namesake: Stick to the ""Reds Tavern Burger"", or Reds Tavern Double"" as its the same taste and fills you up just as much as the so called ""gourmet"" burgers, but for a few dollars less. Skip the overpriced soft drinks and appetizers, and don't bother with the cheap tasting salads.   If you're dying for a good salad for dinner, swing by Dennys (not joking)...They have a prime rib (or chicken) salad with spring mix (can be subbed for romaine, which Red Robin doesn't offer), and generous portions of toppings for around $9 or $10 bucks and less expensive drinks. The Red Robin salads don't even measure up. Please don't waste time and money in this area of the menu. Spend $10 or less on your entree, be sure your meal comes with bottomless fries,  and you most likely will get your dollars worth. Service is acceptable, but like the food, can be very inconsistent...

She went out of her way to fix the screw ups of the mental giant & Michelin rated cook working the grill. I state this as she had to send the burger we ordered back twice as apparently the company doesn't provide training as to what ""medium rare"" is. Both times the burger was cooked to death and had the mouth feel of going down on a corpse.  After 2 fails she went out her way to apologize for the situation which was not her fault, and comped the entrée. It was a sad situation that she did this on her own, given this was a text book situation for the manager to handle however, management must have been busy handling all 14 customers in the entire restaurant at that time. Other locations seem to care about what they serve howver, for this location,  mediocrity and apathy are the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.8200000000000003,2.72

The meals were brought to us in about 6 minutes. Very fast. I asked for BBQ sauce and the waitress brought me the BBQ sauce and ranch dressing. So glad she read my mind because I'm an idiot, I meant to order ranch not BBQ sauce. She kept our drinks full and checked on us just the right amount of times. We finished our food and drinks, but stayed an extra hour catching up because we hadn't seen each other in a while. Staff was super friendly and didn't try to push us out. Absolutely loved it and will definitely return soon.  Food was great. I ordered the BBQ chicken wrap with endless fries. One serving of fries was enough though.  Join the rewards club.

Food came out after a bit. I got the Chili Chili Cheese Burger. I was a bit disappointed in the burger. There was some chili on it, but nothing as claimed on the menu. I hate to say it, but I've had better chili cheese burgers at some off beat places like Apollo Burger. The fries at RR are always good. I like the larger thicker cut fries. I also like to add the Red Robin seasoning to my fries. The drink was great. It was the raspberry cream. Christina even made sure that I got one to go.

Since I had a gift card, I landed here. Decided to take home the NachosOMG from the bar menu and they didn't disappoint. Plenty of chips, cheese, chili, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, etc. But what was also impressive was the way the to-go-order was put together. Packaged in a nice container, put in a plastic bag with plenty of napkins, plastic forks, spoons and extra salsa.

56,Shannon B.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,128,48.0,1.0,2016-12-28,"If I could give it one star I would. My husband and I were driving from Las Vegas to California so we decided to order take out from here and avoid fast food. I called just as we were leaving Barstow and it said 30 mins on the gps to reach this location. I called and placed the order and the man said it would be ready in about 20-25 mins. I thought perfect. I ordered a salad so even if it sits there for 10 mins it will still be fine. When I arrived I went to the take out section and let the bartender know I had placed an order. He called over another lady who then printed me receipt. I explain I was paying with an E-gift card and she looked at me like she had never heard of such a thing. I explained to her how it works and she left to go process the transaction. She returned 10 minutes later and said one gift card wouldn't work. Finally when the payments went through she left again for another 5 or so minutes only to return to hand me the bag that's been sitting behind the bar the whole time. She starts to walk away forgetting that I ordered drinks. The whole time she is processing my payment and wandering around the bartender is standing there. He could have easily filled the drinks. As she starts filling them slowly they strike up a conversation on how excited they are to have the next 2 days off work and blah blah blah. Look, I've worked in customer service. It's exhausting I get it. But you really aren't busting your ass. Your location was dead when I was there and it took you 15 mins to process my payment and fill 2 drinks. So there conversations in front of a customer was just rude in my opinion. When we finally got on the road I opened up the food boxes and our ""extra order if fries"" was maybe 7 fries in total. Not even a whole potato. I am very disappointed in this visit so unfortunately I will never be back. We make the trip to and from California every other month so this would have been a great stop to fuel up on the drive but it appears we need to find another restaurant. I already posted my experience on social media so my friends who also make this trip regularly know to avoid it if they want a quick experience through the order out menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

Nothing else on the burger was appetizing either. I can't put my finger on why, it just was. The taste was ok, but not what I'm used too getting from them. Everything else was ok. Service was good and the place was clean. I would go back and give them another chance. It wasn't a bad experience. More like a little let down.
