The wait is never too long even though it always seams busy. The service is excellent, and the food is always good. I like to try different things when I go to restaurants, but I can't help but order the Blue Ribbon Burger or the Whisky Rivet BBQ Wrap.

87,Tashara H.,"Fresno, CA",106,332,312.0,4.0,2013-03-15,"We came here recently on a crowded Friday night. There was a wait, so we grabbed a table in the bar area (open seating).   I've been to all of the Red Robins in town, and generally enjoy their food. My only issue is that the food tends to be a bit salty, which can be remedied based on what you order. I had to write a review after our last visit.  I wish I remembered our server's name, and will update this when I find the receipt. It was amazing watching him work. My husband and I spent the meal chatting and watching basketball (so we were there for a while)...and not once did we see this guy slow down. If he wasn't checking with us to make sure our food was good or drinks were filled (which he filled without asking once they reached the halfway point), he was checking on other tables, preparing drinks at the bar, or quickly clearing or cleaning recently vacated tables.   As for the food-the Whiskey River Chicken sandwiches that we both ordered were delicious and plentiful, with juicy meat, just the right amount of barbecue sauce, and perfectly toasted whole wheat buns.  The fries were perfectly crisp on the outside with steaming hot interiors.   The whole experience was wonderful.

I noticed on the menu that they had a burger with a fried egg but I did not want the bacon or onion ring strips that came with it so I asked our server, Chad, how much the upcharge would be for a fried egg and he stated .75 or 1.00.  So I ordered a all american cheese burger with the egg as that would have worked out a few cents cheeper than the burger with the egg, bacon and onion ring strips.  The burger was ordered ""medium"" and was overcooked when presented. When the bill came I noticed that the addition of the egg was 1.49 more. The french fries had an ""off"" taste akin to chorine you might taste in the water in some restaurants and I asked my spouse if that taste was also observed and the answer was yes it was. As I walked back from the restroom I counted 7 tables that were empty but had not been bussed.....hummm....short staffed today? On our way out, some customers were walking in and I heard the hostess tell them that the wait time was about 20 mins. to which I mentioned to the waiting customers that this place does not have their act together today as there are many open and clean tables and many dirty tables but no one to either serve the empty tables or bus staff to clean the dirty tables.

And when we asked for the sauces that should have been with them (bleu cheese for Cajun clucks) we were give. Ranch, after about 10 minutes, giving our food plenty of time to get cold.

68,Bianca R.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,2.0,1.0,2015-01-06,"In my 7 years of adulthood I've never experienced being racially stereotyped in my life. That all changed when I visited Red Robin 1/5 @ 445 pm. We were seated promptly- it was before the dinner rush so there were a couple of customers scattered about we were sat in a booth behind a family of 3 who were waiting for their food. Just in time- or so I thought. Our hostess told us who our waitress would be but she wouldn't introduce herself until she brought out the family in fronts food 15 minutes later. By that time we already knew what we wanted to drink and eat- a waitresses dream right? Peach tea, Raspberry tea and Two Burning Love Burgers with a kids pizza. Done. Another 5-10 minutes later, we were finally served our drinks, gee that only took 20 minutes. By the time we were served our drinks family in front was already almost done with their food. So now, the waiting game for our dinner. I assume (since working in the restaurant industry for 2 years) it only took about 4 minutes to put our order in, since we didn't custom create or ask for anything to be taken out, subbed or added. Then the dinner rush starts. More people are being seated- and we're being forgotten. After 30 minutes, our waitress appears with our food. I honestly don't think she would've brought it hadn't the family in front wanting to pay their bill. After the food arrives, she disappears. Cups need to be refilled and when she's walking back and forth between us and the family wanting to leave she almost zooms by with the speed of light so we can't even whisper an 'Excuse me, Stacy can we have a refill of drinks and fries?' I always make a mental note to know what my waitresses name is, after all they are people too- just trying to make a living, I've been there. So when she's finally finished with the family in front she asks how we're doing and we finally get to tell her what we needed 10 minutes ago. I'm all for giving someone the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they're short staffed. Maybe she's had a long day. Maybe just today isn't her day. Maybe- not. As she's gone for our refills another family gets sat where the others left- a white 'rich looking' family- 3 high school boys and their artificial french tipped nails Mom who looks 49 but with a ton of makeup under a low light 56- yeah I notice stuff like that. As Stacy drops off our refill, she immediately rushes to the family- drinks? Whoa, they were just seated- how nice. She returns with drinks faster than you can say 9 Mississippi's (I'm probably exaggerating) but it was pretty damn fast. She then comes back to us... at this point we're done my daughter scarfed down her burnt pizza so fast I didn't have time to complain about it at this point I hit her with three things- refill fries, box and check. I wanted something to drink but I was afraid of bothering her with more things - again the benefit of the doubt. She brings out the box and check, fries will come out shortly. She walks to the newly sat family and takes their order. Whoa, less than 5 minutes and she's already taken their order and she walks back she picks up the check and enters their order and slides my card. Waiting. 10-15 minutes. Waiting. I finally flag down a waitress (I never do this because I know your original waitress will hate you for it) at this point I'm done being polite. Can you ask Stacy to come see us? She finally emerges with our check and for the family in front of us- their FOOD. WTF! I know I'm Hispanic, I know this. But it's not like we came from the fields in jeans and a dirty tee. I have my Cowboys jersey on, boyfriend is dressed date night casual my daughter zebra print sweater and velour sweats. I couldn't believe it. How the f*** did they get their food so fast? They just got here. My boyfriend- don't leave a tip, I seriously still was after ALL that, ALL that horrible service I was still going to leave her something- until I saw their food. I wanted to flip out, I wanted to speak to the manager, I wanted to make a scene! My Mom however raised me better. I left a small note where you're supposed to leave a tip, put a big X on it and stated, 'Service was slow and I was racially profiled. Thanks.' I've never left a restaurant without leaving a tip. Never. Even if the service was slow- but to be profiled because I'm Hispanic? I would've left 18%, I always do. Always. Not this time. I didn't even feel bad when I left. She deserved it- serves her right. She even managed to not include the whole receipt- where you can leave a survey because she already knew how terrible she was. So I have nothing left but to write a review here in hopes that she/management sees it. I won't make a scene, I won't yell obscenities even though I want too. I'll just stick to Chili's from now on.

I have always been a huge supporter of RED ROBINS and their endless fries, but my past two visits have been nothing but a disaster. I will be speaking mainly about my most recent experience (which was on 1/12/2015). After bringing our meals, the waitress forgets to bring us our drinks. By drinks, I mean plain water. After devouring my Royal Red Robin sandwich, my throat begins to feel a little parched. We wave down the waitress to ask for our waters and some ranch for our fries. Call me a big baby, but I LOVE fries with ranch. Don't you?? Any who, after a few minutes, our waitress comes back with our waters... but NO RANCH. We gave her the benefit of the doubt... I mean.. she was holding a glass of water with each hand and she only has two hands, right? She'll be right back with our ranch, right? WRONG! She begins taking orders from other customers and totally ignores us. We tried to give her the ""we need help"" eyes, but she didn't even look our way. Finally, she passed us and we asked for some ranch. By then, our fries were already cold and our dinner was semi ruined. Thanks Red Robins...   My 2nd experience was very similar, but instead of the missing ranch, our waiter forgot to bring us our water drinks for the entire duration of our meal. He only realized about the missing water when he brought us our bill. I never wrote a review on this incident because it was VERY busy that day, so I can sort of empathize with his situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clovis?start=100,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.988,2.24

Upon being called, we told them it would be a party of five, instead of the four. Easy fix, as a server myself a simple chair add would be an ideal solution. Instead we had a pair of eyes rolled at us by the very rude hostess who sighed heavily and told us "" ugh, it's gonna be awhile longer now."" We agreed to wait and the lobby began to fill and soon parties of seven, six and five were being seated before us. Upset because we had now been waiting for fourty five minutes, we asked the hostess again if we'd be seated soon. Again, receiving nothing but attitude and very unfriendly service, if you can even call it that. We were never acknowledged by anyone else there and ultimately ended up leaving and spending my father's birthday elsewhere.

See that apathy? Yeah, that's something new, because my boyfriend and I used to frequent this RR quite often, and lately, it's fallen off our list of go-to's. I think there are several culprits to this downward slope in our interest, but allow me to highlight what isn't in OUR control and what's definitely in RED ROBIN's control. **FRY PORTION SIZE: I know RR has bottomless fries, but C'MON! You expect me to eat these SIX fries and then ask you for more while you're catering to 10 other tables? I understand the need to cut down on wasted fries, but this fry to burger ratio is just WRONG. **WATER REFILLS: Fun fact about me, I drink tons of water. What do I have to do to get a refill over here? I never used to have this problem. I think I'll chalk this one up to poor training or lazy service. Now, I DO want to give props to the BUSSERS. They clearly work harder than the wait staff, at least on our last visit in particular. They're fast, efficient, and they do their work with a smile. If there was a separate segment where I could rate JUST the bussers, they'd get an A. But RR as a whole? A very solid, middle-of-the-road C. Not terrible, but not altogether outstanding.

The guy working at the AT&T store asked if I worked in the mall since I got there so quickly. I said no. He then said, ""oh because the lady who turned it in works at Red Robin."" What!!! So I'm pretty sure she was the one who stole it in the first place. I asked for her name and he said she said she would only turn in the phone if he promised not to release her name to me.

63,Jessica M.,"Fresno, CA",1,12,1.0,1.0,2015-07-17,"First I would like to say I haven't been to a Red Robin in about 8 months, usually visit the River park location, but always looked forward to eating at this establishment...until today (07/17/15). My Mom and I came to this location after shopping at Target.  Upon arrival we were seated within 10 minutes with a request for a booth. Usually when you ask for a booth you tend to like the seating room from side to side, and they tend to be more secluded. Obviously the hostess didn't pick up on that as we were seated in the tiny mini booths on the side of the busy walkways.  The waitress was friendly enough and got our waters pretty fast. As I was looking around I noticed the remodel of the restaurant. Part of the reason I loved visiting Red Robin was the nostalgia and decor. It reminds of a cafeteria now. Absolutely hate it.  I could overlook the remodel...until I saw that the menu had changed as well. Basically upping the prices for over glorified burgers you can make at home. Mom ordered a Guacamole bacon burger, and a crispy chicken tender salad for myself (my usual...I LOVE the harbored egg in my salad).  Our food came after about 25 minutes, and I was pretty pissed when I saw what the waitress had put down in front of me. She had gotten our order correct, but I didn't remember ordering HALF SIZES...until I realized something. NEW MENU, HALF ENTREES, SAME PRICE AS BEFORE. I was paying the same amount of money I always had for the same salad...only this time the portion was HALF the size. My mom's burger was average, and the new ""cup of fries"" thing they are doing...RIDICULOUS. Bring back the basket. The one thing from my salad that was missing was the one thing I loved...the eggs. The lettuce also came from a bag. 11 dollars for a 2 dollar bag of salad. Overall we were over charged for the amount of food we got. So disappointed that the Red Robin I know and loved is long gone.

I think putting a family of four in the back room made it even worse.  I ordered the whiskey river chicken while the wife ordered a bacon cheeseburger. When our order came out I noted the cheese looked like it had just came out the fridge. With the knife I cut a piece of chicken and realized the whole sandwich was cold. It looked like it had sat over night and was microwaved. I had to go look for my server to notify her of my situation. During that time, she put a order in for a replacement sandwich.  When I came back to sit down, wife had notified me that she found a hair embedded in the cheese. Very unsatisfied. I again had to flag down my server to notify her. By that time, my wife didn't even want the replacement burger. I had to ask to speak with a manager.  They came and apologized like a manager always does. I shouldn't have to ASK to speak with a manger. If their was something wrong with one order, maybe. But in this case it was 2 incidents. The manager made offers for refills and what not.

Um, that didn't make sense as it was so slow in there now?! We had to ask for a new napkin as it was covered in red lemonade or something?!? And a new fork that was so terribly bent it was like a crazy snaggle tooth! I soooo wish has taken a photo! I men how did she put them on our table in the first place?  My burger had avocado but it was so bruised and dark that i had to remove it from my burned patty. At least i has the killer fries, right?! No. They were old and grease saturated. Needless to say I was DONE.  Kids liked their shakes.  This is my last time at this location. Waitress was apologetic but regardless I left frustrated and hungry.   She told the manager and they removed my meal. That was the least they could've done. But honestly we won't be returning again. P. S. You can no longer get your fries ahead. But they will for a fee. Guess it didn't matter that we had just ordered FOUR burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clovis?start=40,2.16,2.16,2.16,1.604,2.16

127,Marin H.,"Fresno, CA",99,2,,1.0,2015-08-23,"Sunday afternoon. The time? 2:30 pm. My sister and I walked into a crowded RR and decided to eat in the bar. We waited for one of the multiple dirty booths to be cleaned with much banging and clanging by the busser. Shockingly loud. My sister ordered the happy hour Sauza margarita and ordered salt on the rim, not realizing the two tablespoons of salt there would be in the drink mix. Once she stopped have salt seizures, she flagged down our waitress to exchange it for a safe choice of a vodka tonic. She found that more enjoyable. I avoided the whole drink fiasco and went with water. Smart choice. My sister ordered the Spicy Sombrero Salad and I had the DGB burger which (I think) stands for Don't Get this Burger. The sun dried tomatoes in oil coupled with an insanely greasy ciabatta bun only made me regret adding onion straws to said burger which were drenched in (you guessed it!) oil. There was enough oil for me to take some home with me...on my pants. My sister's salad was from a bag with a whole, a deep fried, cheese topped corn tortilla laid on top and under the salad was a spattering of random black beans and corn with a funky tasting ranch. She asked for fresh jalapeños instead of the deep fried ones, which means less oil, we've learned...but they only gave her five medallions and one was the rump of the pepper! Needles to say she was pretty bummed so, she shared my six fries. Yes, we asked for more. We received...wait for it...seven! Woooo! Bottomless fries, you say? We saw the bottom...twice. It's scary there. Don't go to this RR. It may be your last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clovis?start=120,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.6680000000000001,2.2
82,Kristina A.,"Fresno, CA",35,47,44.0,3.0,2015-09-12,"Decent, is how I can sum it up. First off my family regularly patronizes this establishment but recently our visits have not been very regular.    Gripe #1! Primo complaint! Coming in and told there will be a 20 minute wait when the restaurant is full of empty tables. As we were waiting with our hungry 2 year old we watched servers roll in the front door and finally the tables started to fill up. ATTENTION SCHEDULE MAKER! It would be awesome if you would staff your restaurant appropriately to meet the meal time rush, not catch up to the meal time rush.  Gripe #2! That glass covered back seating area where they quarantine people who have kids, I'm guessing this is pure speculation. I HATE being seated in this area. The booths are always dirty, it's hot, it's right off the loud kitchen where you can hear the social interactions of all the staff, and you're basically forgotten back there. I understand that unruly children are not pleasant to some people, however this restaurant is a family restaurant. They have a kids menu, crayons, and a big red bird mascot. I pride myself on my daughters restaurant manners for her age and I'm fully capable of keeping her under control without the assistance of your special family dining area, aka Siberia!  The service is usually good to fair. This location seems to have a high turnover, because I never see the same person twice in a short period of time. There also seems to be some unseasoned wait staff. We joined the loyalty club, but have yet to reap any benefit from it. Yet, the server will ask you at least 5 times until you agree to join. I'm sure they get points or have a metric they are trying to reach. We are very basic in our needs. We want our order taken fast, and the food to come out, pay and leave. If our server can do that they likely won't even have to come back to the table. Most of the time this happens.  The food! Okay, well I'm going to say the food is consistently good. The burgers are great, other menu items like salads can be hit and miss. The fries are alright, I seem to remember them being better. We stick to burgers, usually whatever special promo burger they are offering that month.  The kids menu is great. Lots of choices burger, pizza, chicken on a stick, and Mac and cheese. However, it all comes out and is set in front of my daughter at approximately 500 degrees!!!!! Every time!!!! A) don't set a hot plate in front of my hungry toddler just so I have to take it away from her. B) kitchen people, if you're going to serve food please make sure it's appropriate temperature for human consumption. Last visit I had to blow on my daughters Mac and cheese until my burger was cold, that's how hot it was. This has happened several times. My child is small and eating can be tricky, the child's menu comes with a side of something; apple slices, fruit in syrup, broccoli, salad or fries. I always say ""no side for her she won't eat that much"" every time the server has to have a fight with me about how it comes with the meal. Okay, I give up! so I always end up asking for broccoli and request cheese so she'll attempt to put one piece on her mouth, and there is never any cheese on the broccoli. Oh well, not like she eats it anyway.  Overall, this is a fair place to get a burger in Clovis. This location had been 5 stars but in recent years has slipped. It's still better than the Riverpark location! I would love to see this Red Robin restored to its former glory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clovis?start=80,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.9960000000000002,2.28

78,Philip B.,"Fresno, CA",5,45,11.0,3.0,2015-09-19,"Well the only reason I am giving it 3 stars was because of the Hostess. I really would give it less. I had brought my daughter and 3 of my grandchildren for lunch 9/19/15. My daughter wanted to breastfeed her newborn so she asked for a table where the other patrons wouldn't be put off.  The hostess gave us a table in a far corner of the restaurant which was just fine. After we were seated our server, Stacy, asked if we wanted drinks or whatever and maybe appetizers. We just sat down so we didn't decide then. Stacy mentioned that I would be able to order appetizers through this table tablet I guess you would call it.  Stacy came back we ordered our meals and then I told Stacy that we wanted to try the Great Northern Poutine Fries. She grabbed the device and started going through the menu and seemed a little bit annoyed that I didn't do it. Well if your my server then you can do it. What's next cook my own burger. We will get to that later.  Anyway the Poutine Fries came out and let me just say SAVE YOUR MONEY. First of all it was $9.00 next it was just a pile of fries (which you get with your meal and they give you more when you just ask for them) with a mushroom, cheese curds they are called and some sauce on it. I say a mushroom because if you could cut up one button mushroom, sautéed it and put it on our Poutine Fries. There you would have it. Stacy came back to the table and asked how we liked the Poutine Fries and I said well to tell you the truth I'm really disappointed with it being $9.00 and it coming out looking like this and tasting like this. She just turns and says yeah I don't like anything on that either. You think she would have gotten the Manager to see why.  Our meals came out. My daughter mentioned they don't even ask how you want your burgers cooked anymore and I told her because then they only get one complaint. They char every burger so the only complaint you get is my burger is done to well. Not it's too pink or I wanted it medium. They just cook them all very well so you only get the one complaint. My Grandaughter mentioned they didn't even ask her what type of cheese she wanted on her Bacon Cheeseburger which I know they used to ask. And I had the Uberburger and again I say save your money. That was $14.99 dear Lord what was I thinking. They have gone a bit askew with their food. Used to be mouthwatering and delicious. You can get a way better burger at Bulldog Burger Bistro or the Mad Duck and pretty much the same price if not cheaper. I'm wanting to know.

I would say with great confidence that McDonald's would have been a better option. Finally got the fries I mentioned... Wrong ones .. Ordered sweet potato. Waiter put out that I wanted the fried I paid the upgrade for. Burger was burnt. Felt like you bathed in grease after. The bathrooms. I have never... Ever... Had to use something so baron with supplies and coveted in every kind of filth you can imagine. Waiter had 0 interest in taking orders and even when I asked what was on draft. He gave a generic coots light .. Bud. After hearing another table with a good waiter I soon realized our waiter failed to mention roughly 8 beers .. Settled for a Dr Pepper I waited 10 minutes for.

We went on Dec. 10th, and sat at a table in the bar area to avoid a wait.  In the past we have had our children with us and we're specifically told sitting in this area was not an option as it is only for 21 and older.  We would not sit in a bar with our children either way but the hosts made a specific point to say this when giving us our wait time...  there's also a sign saying 21 and older only.  Ok. So we had no children this time and sat at a booth close to the bar. A couple walked in with two small children about 3 and 4 years old.  Sat AT the bar and were served multiple beers.  Not near the bar, at the actual bar.  In the time we ordered ate and left no food was served to this family, only beer.  I guess the bartender wanted that it bad enough to break protocol.

Only about 4 other tables w/ people & a couple @ the bar. We saw 3 employees in the immediate area. Took about 10 minutes to get a server our way. Was on the verge of walking out & going to our favorite spot.

He said he knew some things were bad at the heart of the operation whatever that meant.   Anyways...our food wasn't completely bad but I wouldn't recommend coming here to anyone anymore. They changed the way burgers are served also.  You get a burger on a flat plate & your fries in some hard metal ring thing that you keep bumping your hand on when you pick up your burger. The old baskets were way better in my opinion.    If you want good food & better service go to Yosemite in Clovis. And no I don't work there just a customer.

Tends to be more of a miss so I only come here when I'm craving their sweet pickle relish on a burger and an insane amount of steak fries. Last night my bf and I went in for dinner. We got there around 5:15pm. The wait for a table was 20-25 minutes, so we decided to do bar seating, which there was plenty of when we got there. We got a table and sat there unattended for a good 15-20 minutes. During that time a party had left a booth open so I went to find a waiter to see if they could please clean it so we could sit there. They did and then after that they couldn't really continue to ignore us.  We sat at the booth and 5 minutes later our waiter came. We had, had this waiter in the past and he's always great so I went from annoyed and hungry to just simply hungry. When he brought us our waters he took our order. I got a bacon double tavern burger and my bf got some other tavern burger.  They took about 40-45 minutes to bring our food out. About 5 minutes before they brought out our food, the waiter brought us fries to share because they were taking so long. Now, I understand that it's Sunday night and it's busy but there just seemed to be no sense of urgency from anyone aside from our waiter. I really wish I would've got his name because if it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't want to come back. There was a waitress who just seemed rude and bothered every time we had to waive her down because our waiter was always busy.  Bottom line, if you have time to spend at least 2hrs getting food and don't mind mediocre service, then go by. But in all honesty their burgers are just okay. They're overpriced as well.

My brother and I both ordered burgers, they were great. My only complaint was my bun was super dry, but they gave me different kinds of sauce so I was able to put some extra sauce on it to fix it. I got a nonalcoholic mixed drink and it was SO GOOD! The atmosphere was great, they had flat screens everywhere so it would be extremely great for a sports fan.

69,Delaney B.,"Fresno, CA",183,101,17.0,5.0,2016-04-09,"Let me start this review by saying that while this restaurant may not have me jumping up and down and clapping my hands enthusiastically, anytime it's mentioned as an option for a sit-down lunch, you'll hear no complaints from me. I've been enjoying their concept for years, and with their constantly evolving gourmet burger menu, tavern-style appetizers and the never-changing satisfying bottomless fries, this is one chain concept that I don't mind grabbing a lunch table at during a hectic day, and the Clovis location seems to run as a tight ship. Everyone from the hostess to the GM who checks up on the tables (without being overbearing) makes the guest feels important and welcome. First off, they have a consistent formula, and as long as they continue to promote good service, they have a winning concept as far as I'm concerned. Far too many chain restaurants lately have sacrificed service to those gimmicky tableside ordering tablets, and while Red Robin has them, they don't rely on them. They are almost there as an afterthought. Our server, Conner, during our last experience was on top of our table in a fantastic manner from the moment we sat down to the moment we had everything boxed up and got up to leave. He was seriously an awesome server, and no ""tablet"" could ever compete with either his enthusiasm or his personality. I should mention that we had two of our young kids with us, so without having to be flagged over, he anticipated things like extra napkins, sides of ketchup and ranch, extra small plates and cutting up the grilled cheese sandwich into smaller bites before it even hit the table. I'd like to see any tablet do that... They also really DO have good gourmet burgers. Go ahead and TRY to order a bad burger here. Between my wife and I through the years, we've ordered the gauntlet of ""gourmet"" burgers, and I can personally say that I have never had a bad burger at Red Robin. Yes, there have been burgers that I won't order again, but that's not necessarily saying that I was disgusted, or for that matter, even disappointed. Their cooks seem to be well trained in the science of burger craft, and at the corporate menu engineering level, they have a lock on flavor. Again, I'm going to go back to consistency. I know that I can go back into a DIFFERENT Red Robin a week from now and order the same thing I ordered yesterday, and it will probably taste pretty damned close (if not spot-on) to what I got at the Clovis location yesterday.  Bottomless fries... Okay, seriously guys, these fries aren't mind-blowing, but sprinkle that Red Robin seasoning they have at the table on them and get a few sides of the tavern sauce and I guarantee you'll be there there all day stuffing your face with carbs. There is a definite science to the ""bottomless"" aspect on those fries, and that shaker can of spice tableside has a lot to do with it. Also, you HAVE to take advantage of the free dipping sauces. Ketchup is for amateurs, ranch is good, tavern sauce is freakin' awesome! The tavern sauce is like a sweet thousand island dressing with extra pickle juice. Unbelievable! After that, they have sauce you can pay for (don't be cheap, some of those are really good).  Overall, A really great concept that has worked for years for a reason. We have come to this location many times, and I have honestly never been let down. I normally have a hard time giving chain restaurants five stars, but having returned again and again to this location, and always receiving exemplary service and great food, they give me no choice BUT to rate them high marks and recommend them to anyone looking for a good burger place in Clovis. Also, again, I have to call out Conner as being an incredible server. You treated our table with respect and took care of my kids as if you had kids of your own. You went the extra mile, and I appreciate that. Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clovis?start=60,2.2,2.46,2.46,2.42,2.356

It was 45 minutes by the time we were seated. They asked us to sit in a booth meant for 4 people. We asked if we could move to a booth in the corner and the hostess told us that ""We don't use those booths anymore."" What? Really? Because it's more fun to cram 6 people into a small booth.

28,HippoSushi ..,"Fresno, CA",10,80,61.0,2.0,2016-07-04,"When a man gets upset he doesn't let it out right away. He bottles it up and blows up later over something inconsequential. So when my nephew said ""I want Red Robin for my birthday dinner!"" I didn't say anything. But things didn't go so well later when the credit card reader at the gas pump didn't work.  In a way I thought maybe it was good (I was rationalizing at this point). I never feel good about a bad yelp review, so this could be a chance for redemption. A chance for me to abashedly retract my bad review and tell the tale of the Robin, rising from its own ashes and making a delicious burger, with an adequate number of piping hot fries next to it, and a waitress who wasn't working enough tables to keep two or three waitresses hopping. It was to be an event the bards would sing of for the ages. But alas, it was not to be.  My waitress was the sweetest, kindest person on the planet. She moved from one table to another at speeds that would rival a seasoned Olympian, never stopping to chit chat with fellow employees or even breathe. I felt like I was watching a spartan race. The only thing missing was the mud and barbed wire, and unlike the spartan racers who are understandably surly in the face of such taxing work, our waitress maintained her smile and charm. She was already thin so I was worried she was going to burn too many calories and have some sort of episode. Please, Red Robin, hire more waitresses. It's hard to enjoy my food when I feel guilty for not helping my overworked waitress. I don't know what the table-to-waitress ratio is, but it needs to be lower.  I got the Black and Bleu. I didn't notice any Bleu cheese sauce, and there was but a paltry smattering of Bleu cheese crumbles. And the patty was again cremated. Big ups for spelling Bleu correctly though!  The fries continued to disappoint. I counted this time because I'm OCD that way. I got nine. I appreciate that it was an odd number, but I would've appreciated even more a much bigger number. And they were just above room temperature. It was busy so I don't know how the fries had time to cool. Maybe because they only serve nine at a time. Come on, Red Robin, give a man some fries! That's your thing!  My kids got the pizza and both ended up getting stomach aches from the grease.  Red Robin has so much going for it: great atmosphere, awesome employees, theoretically awesome food (reality used to match the theory). I appreciate someone from Red Robin reaching out for specifics after my last review, though I feel I was pretty clear with my disappointment. Please serve more fries. Please stop scorching the burgers. And please, for the love of God, hire more waitresses. It's painful to watch these sweet young ladies (and probably guys, too, I just always have a waitress) work harder than a professional athlete and keep smiles on their faces. I can only imagine the level of exhaustion at the end of a shift. You can do it, Red Robin!

Still my wife's burger that was replaced wasn't tasty st all for her and it's the same one she had always gotten. In the end though, both my wife and I are sick to our stomachs literally. I hate to say it, but it was the food here. Gonna be hard to return to Red Robin's. If we do, it definitely won't be this location.

6,Audra S.,"Clovis, CA",71,132,997.0,3.0,2017-04-20,"Though I've come here many times, I've never rated this place because each experience is different. Most of the time, I hate to say it, but service is lackluster. After a long wait to be seated (which is understandable--they get pretty busy), your server may not appear for a while. There's usually no or inadequate silverware and napkins on the table. The drinks come out pretty quickly, then the fries. I usually order my fries well done and with mustard, yet mine aren't any different from anyone else's, and they ALWAYS forget the mustard. Sometimes when the appetizers come they STILL don't have enough silverware for everybody, or my mustard.  The food is delicious. I like that their bottomless fries are gluten-free because they're fried in a separate fryer, even if I prefer to have them double-fried for crunchiness. I almost always get a burger here. I personally love the choice of a gluten-free bun or a lettuce wrap for my burger. When wanting GF meals, they have you use that electronic thingy to look up their menu by allergen. It can be very glitchy, slow, and confusing, but it's informative (sometimes I just end up using my phone to access their website). My usual is the Keep it Simple Burger (tomatoes, pickles, onions) under Gourmet Burgers, lettuce-wrapped. The Wedgie Burger is good, too--not so different, and comes with a salad. Though I don't order it, their Chili Cheeseburger IS gluten-free--so is their Guacamole Bacon (just enough guac, and recommend it with a bun instead of lettuce-wrapped; too messy) and Royal Red Robin. I also love the Smoke-N-Pepper (bacon coated in pepper, sharp cheddar, not-so-smoky ketchup) burger on a gluten-free bun, listed under Finest Burgers. This burger has a peppery aftertaste, but tastes mostly like a regular bacon cheeseburger. Also try the DGB and Marco Polo burgers--slightly different flavor combinations.  They've got a good, long list of drinks, too. The food is the bomb, and I love the care they take for ""allergy burgers,"" but the servers can be pretty slow and absent-minded.

16,Shannon C.,"Fresno, CA",32,132,52.0,1.0,2017-05-08,"This restaurant location in general is pretty hit and miss when it comes to good service (and food).  Sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose I guess.  After two awesome visits we returned to making the Sierra Vista location our Red Robin home again (it is closest)... but we decided too soon.  This most recent visit was definitely not the best.  It may be all relative to where you get seated that determines the outcome of the service received.  I should note that there were many empty tables (so there must be a system to their madness), but we were seated in the big group room area to the east side of the building (by Captain Picard & Spock pop art) in one of the tiny little booths that have very little table space which that stupid kiosk thing and additional menus and condiments on it (I'll get to the stupid kiosk thing later).  It was not busy at all!  Every time we have sat here, the service has been ridiculous!   We have come when they are slammed and the food and service are awesome!!!  My husband met me there as he works nearby, and having arrived early he ordered our drinks and an appetizer. Sitting down at the booth I was disgusted... crumbs on the seat and a used napkin shoved in between the seat and the wall... it's one of the tiny booths with only seating for one on each side.  The table was not clean and had a bit of something greasy on it.  I had been there more than 10 minutes before she showed up again.  She was the most frazzled person ever (or maybe she had one too many energy drinks...I dunno) but she stumbled over everything she said as she talked a gazzillion miles a minute.  She took our order (I hoped she had it right... not quite sure at that point) and she asked if we wanted an appetizer.  My husband reminded her of our spinach dip order and she said ""it will be out shortly.""  Meanwhile I finish off my strawberry lemonade and wait for more. My husband sipped at his gin and tonic. Finally our appetizer showed up, the manager (I think it was a manager) brought it out to help our waitress. It was almost delivered to the wrong table (more on that later too!).  Again... it was not busy and our waitress and another kept having a little gossip get together by the register... no sense of urgency or attentiveness to anyone in our area.  Back to the appetizer... It was hot. Chips were burnt, celery looked wilted (as if it had been ready for a while). We finished it off pretty quickly. Still waiting for my lemonade and the rest of our food.  Nothing for about 8 minutes ... then she came by at least four times within a five minute span to let us know our food was almost ready.  But it was a drive by comment as she didn't ask us if we needed anything (cause I really wanted some more lemonade...water... anything after the appetizer). The second time she came by I was wondering if I had imagined the first time she said our food was almost ready.... but when it happened again, all I could do was laugh... I mean she had told us no less than 30 seconds earlier!   P.s. Still no lemonade refill.   Then, in comes a big group to sit at the big table and we get ignored for another ten.  Hamburger finally comes out. No ketchup at our table. Another lemonade shows up (thank goodness). No napkins. Someone stopped by to see if we needed anything . Yes. We need napkins.  And my husband ordered another gin and tonic   She brought us two napkins .  (Umm have you seen my hamburger? It's falling apart and you think one napkin for me and one for my husband is enough?!?). So I deal. My hubby was still waiting for his gin and tonic which didn't show up until he was almost done with his food (second round tasted like tonic water with of gin ... maybe ... still not sure on that one).  Can't wait to finish my burger and fries. Hamburger was just okay. The tomato was mushy so I pulled it off. The hamburger had a different charred taste that wasn't appealing at all, and the strawberries in my lemonade refill tasted like they were way too ripe on the verge of spoiling. The French fries tasted like onion rings and were definitely left in the fryer a bit too long (p.s. I hate onion rings).  Finally our waitress comes back and asks if we wanted dessert. I said no. She said okay and said that a ""9 or 10 rating would be appreciated on the survey"" all I could do was laugh. We were trying to figure out how to get the rewards for our Red Robin royalties membership, before paying and the coupon I received via email was not honored... we just wanted to be done. So we paid. As we are leaving the manager tracks is down OUTSIDE to tell us we did not pay for our appetizer.  It had been left off the ticket and he was in the process of changing it but we paid before he could fix it.  Really?  His apology placed blame on us because we paid when prompted by our waitress and we failed to notice it?  So embarrassing. We paid the 7.99 and will never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clovis,2.88,2.35,2.35,,2.5620000000000003

I got here at 1:30pm and we choose to be seated at the bar area. When we walked in we were not greeted due to co workers chatting and laughing not realizing new customers were there. So we just went to the bar area. The bar area is self seated it is always semi empty so if your party is over 21 it is faster to be seated there!  Our server was attentive and patient due to us not ready for our drinks and food for like 30 min, so finally we decided to get drinks. I got the Skinny Absolute Absolut Freckled Lemonade alcoholic beverage which was disappointing :( only 130 unsatisfying calories. I will not get that drink again it did not taste like anything just lemon water.

I get it, Red Robin is in the business of meat and chicken, but you could have at least made it not look so sad and pitiful. My side salad wasn't much to write home about either. My husband ordered a lettuce wrapped burger that he said tasted good. He swapped his fries for broccoli and added some sauteed mushrooms. My FIL ordered a decent burger and a side salad as well.

For some reason when my boyfriend and I were sat, two other groups were sat at the same time. We all sat in the same seating area and we were all approached by the same server, Meriah. This was a red flag to me that a server was getting three tables back to back! Completely unorganized. Out of the three tables my boyfriend and I were approached last. It took her 10 minutes to get to us because she started the other tables first. Where are the other servers? Why are we being sat if Meriah is not ready for tables? She took our drink and food order when she came up to us. Meriah did not introduce herself, she looked at my boyfriend and I in a rather rushed way.  We both said we wanted fries to start off with. She seemed very annoyed and unhappy. We get our drinks right away, but it took her 15 minutes to ask for refills. I asked her where the fries are to snack on while we wait for food and she blames the kitchen for falling behind. When our burgers came out there was still no starter fries. I question it again and she claims the burgers and fries cook the same amount of time which is why we never received our starter fries. Out of all my times coming to Red Robin the starter fries usually come out with my drink! So our server still keep insisting it's the kitchens fault because they're too slow and they fell behind. Reminder this is a slow Tuesday. This was highly unprofessional for a server to be throwing her team under the bus. She could have said she had forgotten, because she took on three tables at the same time! After that Meriah disappeared. 10 minutes of confusingly sitting I push the ""call server"" button on the monitor that sits on each table. It took along time, but Connor, another server, apologized for us waiting, gave us boxes, and said Meriah left. Our server Meriah left! Clocked out, gone. It made so much sense on why she took three tables because she was in a rush to go home! She did not even wait for a tip or properly cash us out. NOTHING! A complete careless server.
