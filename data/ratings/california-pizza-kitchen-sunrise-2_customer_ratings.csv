87,Mell R.,"Sunrise, FL",2,28,132.0,5.0,2013-01-06,"New to the Sawgrass Mills mall. California Pizza Kitchen is a great addition to the facility. Everyone loves pizza! The menu includes other items that I have not tried. The tiramisu is excellent. I have 2 kids and their kids menu is extremely affordable. Lots of choices. Free refills on all kids drinks, including chocolate milk and apple juice. The kids desserts are $1 and include a choice of a brownie or Sundae. Good service. Great food.

47,Marvin C.,"Palm Beach, FL",45,45,171.0,3.0,2013-03-18,"The decor is great, very modern & welcoming.  Great place to hang out or meet for business. However the service is HORRIBLE.  Could possibly be the one time I went but it was unacceptable we were kept waiting over 5 minutes to sit while half the restaurant was empty, later the lady at the door points to a table ""this is your table"".  Waiter takes our order. 2 pizza, one water & one cocktail(which he recommend as the best cocktail in the house). Minutes later we get 2 pizza, one water. I hint at my drink to see if he would recall, but he brings me water. At this point I wasn't even in the mood for a drink anymore. We get the bill, 2 pizza, one water & one cocktail. When I point it out he apologizes & removes the cocktail. The California pizza was great, my water on the rocks cocktail was ok :) Service needs to improve. I will give them one more try & will update my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=60,3.404,3.404,3.404,3.404,3.4040000000000004
93,Luisa C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",828,237,467.0,2.0,2013-03-26,"Wow - this pizza was not good. Let me first talk about the positive things: - they do offer whole wheat/grain crust, which is a big plus; - they do have healthy menu options like split pea and quinoa on their menu; - their customer service was great, maybe even excessively nice; - their salted caramel pudding was good, but not the greatest. Negative:  - pizza toppings either too little or too much, with too many sauces - pizza just did not taste good. My fiance could not not finish his pizza and did not even want to box it. They provided us with free dessert, which was nice on their part.  We will not be coming back .  We were really hoping for a good pizza joint but I guess California Pizza Kitchen is not the one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80,3.3360000000000003,3.3360000000000003,3.3360000000000003,3.3360000000000003,3.3360000000000007

97,Pammi K.,"Ashburn, VA",1,10,,4.0,2013-07-19,"I know, its a chain but we really enjoyed a wonderful lunch while visiting the area. First the bad ...  The service was rather slow.  We waited almost 25 mins for our food after we ordered. The server was new and she overcharged us and it took 3 tries to have the check corrected! Other than that there were no issues so moving on to the good part...  The kids picked pizza and pasta from kids menu which was standard but they liked it. We ordered the guacamole and chips as a starter and it was fresh and flavorful.  For our main entrees we got the roasted veggie salad and the roasted veggie pizza on whole grain crust.  Hubby and I shared the two items and they were both tasty.  I love it when restaurants don't skimp over ingredients in a salad.  You know, some places its 70% lettuce and only 30% main components. This one didn't, there was a good quantity of roasted veggies and avocado on the salad along with the lettuce.  It was tossed well in the dressing.  Just perfect.   The pizza was excellent and the best part is my kids asked to try a slice because it looked so appetizing.  And then they asked for seconds!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=80,3.568,3.568,3.568,3.568,3.568
102,Carol S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",16,3,,2.0,2013-08-13,"Pizza was only Ok this time. But what I came here to 'complain' mainly was POOR service and hygiene! Went for late lunch on a monday, so was empty. Server was very slow. Didn't bring water refills and didn't come back to check on us, or to give the check. He was too busy talking to his co-workers. Servers look very inexperienced or lazy (?), bringing your HOT pizza without a glove, rubbing against his shirt... the other guy picking his nose... servers checking a girl out when she walks in because she has almost no clothes on... lol Maybe, only maybe I'll be back.

We have been to many CPKs in the area but this one is the best! Bread was delivered to our table fresh from the oven. Our server Catherine was knowledgable on both the food and drink menu, and made two wonderful suggestions. Our food came out freaky fast and was deliciously crisp and flavorful.

Side note: I'm picky about pizza and I actually don't usually like California Pizza Kitchen. All the other locations are just blah.  Now that we have set that straight, let me tell you about this CPK location.  It's set up very nicely with fire place tables outside, nice bar area with TVs and long tables, good regular setting area and a very clean and open kitchen.   They opened a year ago and they just have been improving with each visit I have been there. The managers are nice and care about their customers. The servers are efficient and professional.  The pizza is yummy and not very oily.  My favorite is the pear and Gorgonzola one.  It's very unique and the taste blends very nicely.  Sam loves their California Veggie.  I like the fact they have some healthy choices even though it's a chain restaurant.   Their chocolate soufflé, tiramisu, and butter cake are great choices for your sweet tooth cravings.   Go check this location out, it's good!

It has a more rustic feel which I can dig! It had been years since I stepped in a California Pizza Kitchen... Espresso - good to know they offer this, I needed a pick me up after a long day in the sun!  White Corn Guacamole - I would have preferred more Guacamole as opposed to a plate filled with chips... but it was good and loved that you could actually taste the white corn!

Although it was lunch time on a Sunday there was no wait (although it was pretty busy by the time we left).  The server was friendly and attentive, and made sure the kiddo had her food quickly (good call, server lady!) My buddy and I shared the Wild Mushroom Pizza with Truffle Oil and Chicken Club Sandwich. The pizza was really good and had a good ratio of cheese and toppings. The only thing that was odd was the fact they serve the truffle oil on the side... in a little dish. This made it a little awkward when trying to pour the oil evenly on the pizza, but I guess we were able to handle this daunting task :) Only gripe: I prefer my pizza to be crispy... the dough/pizza was cooked thoroughly, but a little more crispy would have been nice.  The club sandwich was tasty as well, but big chunks of lettuce made it a little messy (the lettuce kept falling out with every bite). Again, we managed. Overall... great service and tasty food.

The atmosphere is very classy and stands out, the staff is super nice and very complimentary they really take care of you. You just feel more comfortable being inside or outside the confines of this restaurant. The food is divine and always good! The drink selection is also impressive they serve house made sangrias and have local draft selections at a low price and the bartenders always make great selections for things to try and really seem to know what they are talking about.

But that turned into my girlfriend convincing me to go shopping. I knew at that point the crowds were going to be everywhere and I decided that I would need good pizza to kick off the day. Since we were headed to Sawgrass Mills Mall, I decided to skip on all the other pizza places we have in the area and go for California Pizza Kitchen. I have not been to a CPK in probably five years so I was excited to finally go there. I guess I never realized that they also had a full service bar. Their cocktail menu looked pretty appetizing and I had a hard time choosing what I wanted. I decided to go with the Citrus Adobo Margarita. Being a Margarita lover, this was definitely a Hit and I would go back to CPK just for that drink alone. It was sweet and tart, spicey and sour on the finish. The Pizza menu looked good. Some of the classics were still around like the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza and Thai Chicken Pizza. For some reason, I was craving their BLT pizza but was sad to see it was not on the menu any more. I should of asked but did not get a chance to, I got distracted reading other things on the Menu. I settled for the California Club which sounded like a ramped up version of the BLT with chicken on it. It featured Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, arugula, basil and avocado. This is a new establishment in the Sawgrass Mills Mall Oasis strip so the place was clean and nicely decorated. They had plenty of seating available at 1PM on Saturday but seamed like they had enough space for the busy hours. They offer Patio seating, curbside pickup and online ordering. I will be for sure coming back in the near future and trying different pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2?start=40,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6,4.0

41,Brenda D.,"Mississauga, Canada",35,67,114.0,4.0,2014-12-05,"The Good: - we walked up to the host and asked to see the menu. He was very friendly and explained some of the options. His personality was one of the reasons we decided this restaurant vs the conveyor belt sushi inside the mall - the same positive host allowed us to pick our spot in the restaurant so we chose one near the windows - the menu had a lot of variety and some items I had never seen including Kung pao spaghetti and Korean BBQ pizza where every dollar of the sale goes to charity  - our server, Nikki, was also really friendly and awesome. She definitely helped with the 4 star rating. She refilled our drinks (mango lemonade and peach iced tea - both delicious!!) without us saying anything. That's a mark of great service.  - the food came in a timely manner and before the food there was bread with an olive oil dip - we ordered the butter cake for dessert and toon it back to the hotel with us. Sooo yummy! It's worth trying it out with the whipped cream which Nikki out in a little container for us so that it wouldn't melt from the heat of the cake. The cake is slightly sweet but not overwhelming.  - there is no charge to make the crust whole wheat - there is no additional charge to have two different halves on the pizzas - the pricing is pretty reasonable. $40 for two drinks, a shared 6 slice pizza and a cake with ice cream The Not So Good: - The pizza was just ok. We had half spicy chicken chipotle and half sausage/pepperoni with whole wheat crust. There wasn't too much chicken and it was buried in the corn and pepper topping. The pizza came with a cilantro crema which was fantastic. The sausage/meatball half really lacked sausage. On one of the three slices there was only one measly meatball which was unfortunate because the toppings were very good. The crust was slightly burnt as well.  - On the menu there is an additional $2ish extra charge for ice cream. Nikki did not inquire as to whether we wanted it or not so we were a little surprised when we received the bill and it was there but since she was so nice we decided to just go with it.  - When we got back to the hotel with the dessert we noticed that they didn't provide us with spoons to eat it with which was surprising because Nikki knew we were staying in a hotel. Thankfully we had a package of plastic spoons from before so we were able to eat the butter cake.

I found out last night that I was wrong.  I'm not going to say that they are better than mom & pop's pizza parlors, but I did enjoy my food.  Ordered the Caribbean sunset sangria in a carafe, which was absolutely delicious. Our glasses came filled with fresh mango, blueberries, and apples, which were nice to eat as a sort of dessert after the meal.  As for the pizzas, we ordered The Works on flatbread and the original White Pizza. The toppings portion of the white pizza was pretty good, the crust was phenomenal! Wow! The works was soooo yummy, they used good quality pepperoni and sausages which made all the difference. It was delicious on the flat bread, but next time I'd like to try it on the original bread.  The service at this location was great. They accidentally brought us a mushroom pizza instead of the white pizza and when I sent it back, the deliverer not only apologized but he sent the manager over to do so as well. Great customer service. And Mel, our waitress, was very sweet.  ONLY DOWNSIDE: In my honest opinion, everything was a bit overpriced.

After waiting 15 min for his meal we enjoyed our salad and pizza which cost us 50 bucks. We would never make the decision to come back. We are just going to have the same meal with better quality somewhere else. And also for a more meaningful price.

This was the first and probably last time I'll ever come to this particular CPK. My boyfriend and I walked in on a Thursday night around 6:30 or 7pm. There was no hostess/host at the stand. After a little bit of time, the bartender (I think) came by to seat us. There was no apology for our wait and barely any greeting. We were seated and began to look at the menu. Our waitress took a long time to swing by to say hello or get our drinks. We were ready to order once she finally came by to get our drinks, but weren't even given the opportunity. Once again, no apology on our long wait to be acknowledged. She took our drink orders and basically ran off to fetch them instead of see if we had any questions on the menu or if we were ready to order. We ordered when she came back and the food was mediocre. We had very little sauce on our pizzas (a barbecue chicken pizza and Thai chicken pizza) and were told that we can't get extra sauce after the pizza has been made. The icing on the cake was when we were done with our meal, we wanted dessert. The waitress came back to ask if we wanted any dessert and when we said yes, I thought she went to get a menu for us but instead we were presented with a check. NO THANKS. I have never experienced such terrible service from a well-known restaurant, and bad food to top it off. I'm not sure if service is always that bad, or if it was just a classic case of ""they look like a super young couple and they won't tip well anyway so I'll barely take care of them"".

There seemed to be some confusion about who should have been handling our table. The first server came back and took our order and we never saw him again. Someone else delivered the food. He never came back to check on us and we had to flag him down to get a refill on my girlfriends drink. He had tables he was serving on the other side of the restaurant so he disappeared a lot. We waited longer than we should have for our check and it was a manager who ended up running it for us. While they were all friendly, this location seemed to be understaffed and not run properly.

We were sat immediately and got a great outside table. Our server promptly took our order and we were munching within 15 minutes. We ordered the California veggie and a unique tortilla pizza called the tostada.  I also ordered the mango lemonade and if you have read my previous restaurant reviews I usually get a lemonade.

But the quality and freshness I've come to expect were completely absent. I had the corn guacamole and the fish tacos. This is not the usual guacamole, which was fine, but it barely had any taste, the little bit of avocado in it was in little chunks, and had that off green color that says it wasn't even close to fresh. It also had none of the flavors of guacamole--no onions and no lime flavor. The fish in the fish taco although fried, was flavorless, dry, and that off color that says not fresh fish!  If this was the first CPK I visited I would never go back.  I saw the place was a bit empty, but I tried it because of my past experiences!

3,Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,648,3116.0,4.0,2017-02-28,"I've been here 3-4 times since moving to FL last summer.   I was a big fan of CPK when I lived in California since it was next to impossible to find good pizza on the west coast.  Also, while in pet friendly CA, we learned that this chain would typically allow pets on the patio and since we were often traveling with our small dogs that worked well for us as a sit down meal option.  I don't believe this location allows pets on the patio, but the one in Boca Raton does.    I now live in South Florida (with other ex-New Yorkers) and I'm fortunate enough to have found some non-chain pizza joints.  I prefer an authentic mom and pop made NY style pie, but CPK is more of a gourmet type of pizza.  If I'm coming here, I love doing so at lunch time (Monday-Friday).  There is a great lunch special and menu, I would say you will get the most bang for your buck that way. I recommend the lunch size pizza with a side salad, it's the perfect portion size.  We stopped in here tonight since we had a gift card left over from Christmas.  We were seated by a friendly woman.  Our waiter quickly appeared, we put in our drink and food order.  We weren't asked if we wanted bread, which is ok since we neither of us was super hungry.  I always wonder how they decide whether to ask you if you want it, but keep this in mind incase you are ravenously hungry. Our food was fresh and tasty.  Took a little while to get refills on our waters, but not the end of the world.  The waiter did ask me for my CPK rewards card info, so I was happy he remembered that.  We didn't order desert tonight, but I recommend the butter cake with a scoop of ice cream.  It's the perfect size to split, it's a good size. Prices have gone up a bit at CPK, so I think that's why the weekday lunch special is the best deal here.  This restaurant offers inside and outside seating.  Nothing beats outside seating on a warm Florida February night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006

Now post-college, those days are rare and very much missed. In fact, given all the options now, it is saying something that I even remember this restaurant. More so, more shocking still is that I still love it. I find that to be flabbergasting as the majority of restaurants I loved five or six years ago, I absolutely hate today. That said, we ended up at this location when we went to Sawgrass Mills. The weekend before we had gone to another mall and regretted not going to California Pizza Kitchen, so this was our first stop when shopping. Going to the restaurant reminded me greatly at how wonderful the food tastes. When we entered, my boyfriend and I had no wait whatsoever. As we sat, I admired the airy and open feel of this location. It was my first time there and I must say I may admittedly prefer it to the one I used to frequent down in Coral Gables. At any rate, I am pleased to say that this chain is consistent. Good service, great food, the works, regardless of location. That's a win-win in my book. Ordered water and strawberry lemonade as our drinks. I had the lemonade admittedly and it was a bit sweet but nevertheless refreshing. We munched on freshly made bread and oil, while we waited for our pizzas. Boyfriend ordered a pepperoni one, while I had the signature BBQ chicken pizza. Pizza was personal size, but I found it huge. I took half of it home as leftovers. My boyfriend, in comparison, inhaled all of his. Debated dessert but skipped it. Paid and we were on our merry way. All this was less than $40, which is a great deal. It could've been better though. I had a coupon for being a rewards member and it said $10 off $40, but we just didn't reach it.

We came on a recent Friday, were seated right away, and had the worst service.  Once we were finally able to order waters and a round of beers, we waited for our beverages. It was passed 20 minutes and we literally had nothing. We then ordered our food- a petite wedge to start, and a pizza each. We received our salad, but still no beer! Whyyy?  We finished the salad, asked twice more about the beers, and finally received them at the same time as the pizza. Honestly, waiting in excess of 15 minutes is crazy for one round of draft beers for two people. On top of that, the food was not so great. My California Club pizza had over-cooked chicken all over it. We asked for refills on waters, over and over, and finally got one refilled after we received the check.  Never coming back again! So long, CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sunrise-2,3.2,3.71,3.71,,3.5060000000000002
