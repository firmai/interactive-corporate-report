12,Joanna M.,"Fort Worth, TX",4,17,,5.0,2012-06-24,No complaints here. Service is always good. Food is always good.  I come here a lot... and it's fun to watch the Texas Rangers play in the bar area :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
11,Hannah M.,"Rockport, TX",180,47,7.0,5.0,2013-01-27,"One of the best places to eat in Stephenville. Chili's is always consistent in the quality of food. We always get great service and know that our food will be perfect. They also have a great deals on Foursquare with each of the times you ""check-in"".  The fajitas are always an awesome choice, the enchilada soup is to die for, the big mouth bites are always a solid choice and the chicken and guacamole sandwich is delicious.  Margaritas are always perfect both on the rocks or frozen, the bar tenders do a great job. Chili's usually has a crowd but they are pretty good about getting people in and out. If you plan on bringing a big group I would get there a little early as it can be tough moving tables together when they are busy. Honestly one of the best places to eat in Stephenville even if it is a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
14,Shanna L.,"Granbury, TX",44,26,1.0,1.0,2014-10-06,"Waited an hour once for my food. Everyone else in my group got their food in a reasonable amount of time. We even had another person join us later who ordered the same dish I had and even they got their food before I did. I asked the waitress several times about my food and was told that it was the fault of the kitchen workers. By the time I got my food, all my friends had already finished. Ruined my experience and I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
10,Ti K.,"Arlington, TX",0,30,,1.0,2015-01-28,"The food is hit and miss.the service is probably the worst in town. All the servers walk around like they are busy but only have 1-2 tables. My waiter though my e gift card in the trash and can't find it,so he told me that is shit out of luck. Save your money and go down the road to Cotten patch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
13,Diamond C R.,"Stephenville, TX",0,9,4.0,1.0,2015-02-01,Poor service. Poor food quality. Used to be decent but has gone tremendously downhill the past year.  Don't know what has changed in this location but they have definitely lost my business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
9,Hailey G.,"Grapevine, TX",151,149,36.0,3.0,2015-02-19,This Chili's is just like any other in my opinion. Service is a hit or miss. Food is okay. There's not too many options in Stephenville so it's better than nothing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
6,K K.,"Southlake, TX",4,36,,2.0,2015-03-03,"Every single time I got to this Chilis, I am disappointed. The food is always cold, burned, or not what I ordered. Mostly, it is ALWAYS burned!  I keep going back because the servers are so nice and I think ""hey this time it will be different!""  Seriously, please change your cook! He/she(s) doesn't know how to cook even a simple flat bread without burning it. How pathetic.  I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
8,Justin M.,"Seattle, WA",6,168,8.0,2.0,2015-03-20,"This Chilis sucks, long wait and slow service and they allow smoking inside. This literally must be the only restaurant in this town",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
7,Giovanny C.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,,3.0,2016-03-31,"Our server (ivette) was great to us and was fast but there were a few things that could of been better. The only issue I had was that the appetizer came a few minutes before our meals, the food quality wasn't the best and I got the classic bacon burger, the meat was dry and our Texas cheese fries didn't have enough bacon, or anything. Almost like a little hand full. If it was based off just the food I would of given a one star but the waiter made up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
4,Xueromal K.,"Fort Worth, TX",87,1,,1.0,2017-01-27,If this would have been my first time at chilis I would never go back to any chilis ever again!!!! Four waitresses with 9 patrons and still had to wait over 20 minutes for a menu!!  Service is absolutely horrible!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
5,Beverly E.,"Stephenville, TX",49,1,,2.0,2017-02-09,"We gave Chili's here in Stephenville one more chance after the debacle of our last visit & review. I did not reach out to Chili's in response to their comment on my review. I wanted to see if anything had truly changed after a month. I have to admit I was just too concerned to order anything that might have tomatoes any where near it. (Serious food allergy to fresh tomatoes.) Our food appetizer & entrees were both good. But once our entree was delivered to our table by the ""co-server"" we were on our own. We could not get our drinks refilled, no one checked to see if we got everything etc. The lack of drink refills was particularly irritating. Our server & the co-server both passed our table MANY times. Our empty glasses were on the edge of the table-not hard to see. I waved my empty glass at both servers - no response at all.  We tried stopping both of them as they went by our table to no avail. Finally, when we were almost done, our server brought more tea.   We wanted to order dessert, but had some questions so we couldnt order from the screen on the table. But our server never returned. He never even brought a check to us.  We finally paid at the table from the screen.  I didnt realize these screens were supposed to replace the servers.  Our exprience makes it seem that Chili's should make their drink stations self service, like in fast food restaurants AND they could do away with servers & only hire food runners & hosts for the front of the house. I guess our expectations are too high.  This is definitely not our experience dining at Chili's in other cities. I gave two stars since we did have edible food this go around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
3,Matt M.,"Stephenville, TX",152,71,170.0,4.0,2017-05-06,"We frequent this location regularly as it's always good.  We've been sharing Chili's enchilada soup for 20+ years!  Enjoyed combo chicken and prime rib fajitas which are always spot on.  With limited options in Stephenville, you can't go wrong with Chili's.  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
0,Riney J.,"Hamilton, TX",0,6,1.0,4.0,2017-10-18,"I liked everything about this Chilis, except for one thing. This is one of the few restaurants in the country where smoking is still allowed in the bar side when you walk in the front door. The smoke is unbearable and you have to walk through it to get to go to the restroom. The food was delicious and delivered in a timely manner. However, it is always disgusting to have to breathe that cigarette smoke when you walk through the front doors. Please! Stop allowing smoking in your restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
2,A B.,"Sunnyvale, TX",0,6,,2.0,2017-11-11,"I hate writing negative reviews but this needs to be done. I usually have good experiences with their Togo option but not dining in. There's been about 5-6 times now that I've dined in and had TERRIBLE service. Waiters would completely forget about us even if they weren't super busy. Almost every time, the waiters not only were rude, but also snappy with us even though we were very polite in dealing with them. If you come here in a party of 2 that isn't ordering alcohol, expect to be completely forgotten about. We kept having to flag down our waiter for everything. To take our drink order, to bring our drinks 20 minutes later, to take our food order 30 minutes later, to BRING our food almost an hour later. There's been 2 times where the waitress is so blatantly rude to our faces that we were left with our jaws dropped. I probably won't ever dine in here again because it's THAT bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
1,JP R.,"Stephenville, TX",0,1,,3.0,2018-01-03,Had an alright stay here but couldn't help but notice another customer's rude waiter. Rushing and having an attitude isn't good for business mate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stephenville,,,,,
