I ordered the hummus, a burger and a cocktail. The server then brings over two cocktails.  I look at her and she says that drinks are 2 for 1. Holy Crap!

20,Aaron P.,"St Paul, MN",0,4,,1.0,2012-09-19,"Went there twice, ate once - once too many. I was at the convention center across the street, and decided to go in for a quick sandwich, stood at the podium for five minutes, while the manager and other staff came and went, and was completely ignored (not even a ""we'll be with you as soon as we can"").  I left. I came back later in the day, because some friends decided to go (and were already) there. Four out of the five us of had our orders screwed up: items missing that were ordered, items added that we asked to be struck, two steaks ordered the same way (medium) where one came back rare and the other well done. And it took more than an hour for food. And the place wasn't that busy.

Erica was our waitress and I think everyone in customer service should be more like her! I was truly impressed! She would go above and beyond her job! While me and my coworkers were deciding what to order, she brought out chips and salsa. We come here maybe every other week, but have never had these. And they were warm and delicious!! She was very nice when taking our order, she voiced her opinion when my coworker wasn't sure what to get. He ordered what she suggested and he was very happy with the meal! I ordered the ""2 for $6.99"" and had no idea it came with french fries. Erica brought out a basket of fresh ones for the whole table. I have ordered this before and haven't gotten the fries with it. Again, I was impressed. The salad and corned beef sandwich (on a delicious pretzel roll!) was delicious as well. We are that annoying party that forget to ask for separate checks until the last min, but Erica was so easy going and split all the cards we had. From now on when I go, I will ask for Erica!

28,Alex K.,"Buffalo, NY",108,169,220.0,4.0,2014-02-17,"This place.  Heh.  This place.  I'm not much of a fan of chains, but I've done quite a bit of traveling, spent far too long at too many airports, acquainted myself with enough airports to know that T.G.I. Friday's is a safe bet.  The food ain't much to sniff at.  It's replacement level.  It's the measuring stick to which I compare any other similarly priced chain or local joint.  Food-wise, drinks-wise, this place measures up.  It hits that three-star mark pretty squarely.  Ever been to a T.G.I. Friday's?  Then you know exactly what to expect. There is exactly one distinctive thing about this T.G.I. Friday's that does actually raise it up a notch, that being the physical space it occupies.  On the ground level of a fair-sized hotel that I suspect used to be something else, the interior doesn't resemble that of any of its normally suburban peers.  Sure, it has tables and a few booths, but the key feature is a four-sided bar in the center of the space on each side of which large TVs have been carefully positioned to provide bar patrons comfortable access to whatever's showing (usually sports of some sort).  The sheer configuration here numbers it among the top five venues to presently watch sports of any type.  That the leather stools are both wide and plushy dramatically increases the comfort.  If I want to spend a Sunday afternoon watching football all day, this is a pretty fair spot to do so. Thanks to the amount of time they've inhabited their space, the operators have grown accustomed to the staffing demands of given times, but it is possible to catch them betting on the ""under"" of patron demand.  Although normally about as efficient as T.G.I. Friday's staffs are anywhere (not really a compliment), any increase can stress them and turn the whole place into a clusterfuck.  On the other hand, they can be quite solicitous off peak, and it does seem that they recognize regulars. 3 stars for food  3 stars for drinks  3 stars for food  5 stars for layout 3.5 stars overall (rounding up)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997

I definitely have chain restaurant guilt.  There are so many good restaurants and bars in downtown Buffalo, so why would this be our go-to location before Sabres games? First, after 5pm, there is ample free street parking around the area, so after dinner we take the train down to the arena (and then back after the game).  Very convenient, especially now that the trains are back to full-service.  Second, there is rarely ever a wait for a table, even when they are busy before the game.  Third, this location offers 2-for-1 drinks ALL THE TIME.  House wines, margaritas, Long Island Iced Teas, and I believe there are beer specials as well.  Makes for a very economical evening if you are trying to avoid the $8 midget beers in the arena. Note that not all TGIFriday's offer this special. Fourth, the service is always good.  We've really never had a bad server, and oftentimes they are really good!  The manager can always be seen walking around, asking how your meal is, and if there's anything he can do to make it better.  Fifth, the food is pretty damn good for a chain, and there's a large selection of things for everyone.  Like someone else said, stick to your ""bar-type"" food like appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, etc, and you will not be disappointed. OK there it is, I finally admitted it and came out of my TGIFriday's closet.  I'm ready to profess my love publicly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004

The wings were hot and crispy and the sauce was addicting. The mozzarella sticks were ooey gooey and crispy with a lot of flavor. I wasn't crazy about the beer cheese sauce that accompanied the soft pretzel sticks( which were fab on their own!)  because it had bacon on top, and I am not a huge fan of bacon flavor ( I know, right!?)...I thought the sauce overpowered the pretzel flavor but to each their own...Next I had a chicken Caesar salad- which is near the top of my favorite salads list. Unfortunately this time it wasn't up to par. Very little cheese, slightly bitter lettuce and the chicken was over cooked and on the dry side. That's okay because I still enjoyed everything else.

Here she was giving me an attitude over the very thing that 20 minutes prior she was ok with. After receiving menacing stares & being approached several times over the very thing that was okayed from the beginning; I asked for my bill.  It was at that point that Sarah's (manager) mannerism became less ornery. I called Bob to explain my experience & he apologized. At this point I was content.

She claimed it would be emailed to me. Of course it wasn't. And from her tone and her choice of words I already knew she wasn't sending anything. She told me that they did me a favor letting me eat there disregarding that they made me uncomfortable doing so. And that people were staring not b/c of the commotion from the staff making a scene, but that I brought it on myself bringing food in the restaurant.

6,Kristen M.,"Victor, NY",0,20,1.0,1.0,2017-09-06,"We had 3 people in our party, went in for only dessert.  Took well over 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us at the table/ask if we wanted drinks.  After sitting there for a half hour our dessert finally came out melted as could be.  It was an ice cream that was clearly already made in the freezer & just set on the plate (no reason it should have been melted) When the server brought it out we all kind of just looked at it & he offered to bring a new one, which took him less than 1 minute.  I called over the manager & he took care of the bill, but poor service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

1,Aaron R.,"Lockport, NY",44,30,99.0,1.0,2018-01-05,"My friends and I went here to have dinner before the Buffalo Bandits Home Opener, as it is close to the train station so we can ride down to the arena. This has been our place to go for a decent dinner and off to the game. I believe this will be our last time. To start off we were greeted the host who said they would have us out in time before the game, and this was the beginning of the end. There were 4 of us total, but our one friend was running behind but gave us his order so that we could get it in to save time. The 3 of us ordered the endless apps(Mozzarella Sticks,Boneless Wings,Pot-Stickers), and my other friend ordered the Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich. The first round of apps took around 15-20 minutes to come out, which was 4 mozzarella sticks. A couple minutes later the pot-stickers came out, but no sign of the boneless wings or the Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich. We ate what was brought to us, ordered another round when they were dropped off, and we received another round of 4 mozzarella sticks, and pot-stickers. After being there for about 45 minutes the sandwich was inquired about, and then it was brought out with another order of boneless wings. We spoke with the waitress to explain that we were headed to the game, as we were dressed in Bandits gear, and that we needed to catch the train. My friend had to basically shove the sandwich in his mouth, we waited for the bill (she did take off one of the endless apps which was nice of her) but then disappeared with the bill and credit card for another 10 minutes.  We were not impressed with the service, and we barely made it to the game on time, in the future we will find another place to go for dinner before the game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
2,Paul S.,"Hamburg, NY",0,19,,1.0,2018-01-13,"This place is pretty awful.  I've been here twice.  The first time the service was very subpar (they had mistakenly given our food to another table...who then apparently ate it).   The second time, today, we were non-greeted by a hostess who let us stand and wait while she conducted a personal conversation for a minute or two.  She then acted bothered when we asked for a table by the window...despite it being not busy at all at 430pm.  Then a few minutes after being seated and came back and asked us if we'd mind moving ""to the back"".  After saying that yes, we would mind, she insisted we move.  After telling her we'll just leave instead (which we did), I asked for her name, to which she replied ""it's not important"".  After asking to speak with a manager we were told ""they're all busy"".  It is safe to say that we will not be going back here, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
