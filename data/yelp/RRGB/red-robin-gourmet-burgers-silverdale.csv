Bob D.,"Kingston, WA",0,5,,5.0,7/24/2017,"Always friendly, always great, but....ALWAYS BUSY. Parking can suck, but being at the mall, you will find a spot.

Carmen M.,"Bremerton, WA",34,3,1,5.0,11/30/2017,"Went to their website for my first online order. Was that ever easy. I was able to sub items quickly. I applied my rewards card with no problem.  I like that at check out I was able to tip as well.  Pick up was at the bar, lucky I'm over 21. I had to wait about 3 minutes for my whole order. They gave a small cup of fries ""for the ride home"" that were fresh and hot.  Food was packaged well and they gave me plenty of napkins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale
Craig S.,"Poulsbo, WA",1,38,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Hadn't been to a Red Robin since the days when it's food and wait staff were what you measured all other burger joints by... and boy has it changed.  I counted no less than 6-8 employees ""sharing"" duties at my table and NOBODY gave a damn or was responsible. I could have had a tastier cheeseburger at Sonic for a few bucks instead of  $13.00 and perhaps even known just who my server was! When I thought I'd seen ""it all"" a waiter (use that term lightly) sat down at the table with a family to take their order, and then whilst leaving in a huff notice who might have been my waiter sitting in a booth with a friend. Maybe if you don't remember what Red Robin once was it works for you, but as for me they'll NEVER see another dime from this guy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale
Lynn L.,"Waimea, HI",52,18,73,4.0,11/17/2017,"Casual date night with my wife. We sat in the bar area to avoid a long table wait. We arrived a few minutes before the happy hour ended and were greeted by our waitress Kierstin. I was looking at the happy hour menu and was informed we had two minutes to order. I asked a few questions and got a catty, ""Now you only have one minute "". If she was trying to be cute, the tone killed it. I ordered the Whiskey Jack Tavern burger and my wife had Mac and cheese with a Caesars salad. Burger was good but had two really thin patties rather than regular sized patties. If you want bottomless fries, order right away. We were finished with our entire meal before they arrived. We had ordered halfway through the meal. The waitress did check on us a few times but it was busy. Decent meal overall",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale
Kelsey J.,"Allyn, WA",51,4,,1.0,12/28/2017,"I used to love Red Robin !! My favorite burger was the blue ribbon . I was excited to go to Red Robin After not going for like three years . Well I went the other day, and let me tell you It has changed . First of all, the waitress was rude , she Told us she couldn't explain a beer because it was new . Ok, so go get someone who can.  This chick has pink hair , which I know doesn't really apply to this, but If she sees this I want her to know to get a better attitude , she also gave me a 22 oz beer when I asked for a 16. She even wrote it down! When My burger came it didn't even taste like a blue ribbon burger. It Way too much sauce, and two little curds of blue cheese . Really? And the bun was stale. Came with like 6 fries that were soggy. The waitress we ended up having tho agree the rude one was very nice though .. Sorry redrobin I won't be back , your food has gone down hill and is nasty. Stocking  to my blazing onion! Way better!! Also you keep your bar freezing and uncomfortable ! Fix that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale

Kim M.,"Kingston, WA",279,190,147,4.0,6/12/2017,"I really enjoyed my visit at Red Robin in Silverdale today. It made up for the last visit that I had which is pretty awful. In fact it was so awful that they gave me a certificate to come back. I used it this time with no issues. Kirsten, the server, was really outstanding. She explained some new items on the menu, was very patient with me, and made sure that everything was in order make me happy for being here today after a long day at work.  I opted for a basic burger wrapped in lettuce. I I liked the presentation.  And, you didn't just get the burger in the lettuce, but they actually wrapped it in a foil wrap to undo as you ate. It made it not messy at all.  I had the freckled salad. That's a fruit salad with their freckled lemonade poured over it. It was a bit sweet but I liked it overall. Everybody knows Red Robin. We already have opinions about whether they're good or not. But if you like Red Robin and you come to Silverdale, and your server is Kirsten, I think it will be extra enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale
Brittany L.,"Port Orchard, WA",25,125,20,5.0,10/19/2016,"We always have a positive experience when we go to Red Robin. The fact they give our children balloons and the chalk in the waiting lounge really show they are a family friendly place. I just want to speak about our last visit, where we had Napoleon waiting on us. He didn't even bat an eye to our table that had two small toddlers sitting at. He was so kind and patient that I will be requesting him upon every visit. This guy knows how to gauge his customers and wait on them accordingly.  Our food was great, and he was so nice to us when we asked for extras after he was JUST at our table.

Heather J.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",193,643,282,4.0,12/1/2015,"I've been eating here for as long as I can remember. Its probably my favorite place to eat near the kitsap mall. I have meet countless friends here for food and drinks. It definitely has gotten quite a bit nicer over the years. I would say it is currently one of the better looking Red Robins around but this could be because so many others seem to be in some sort of state of renovation. I love that this is a place you can bring children without having to be too concerned about their behavior. They seem to enjoy the coloring and kids menus as well. Be careful you don't let them play too long with the new table ziosks or you will be paying an additional 1.99$ with your meal.  This is one of my favorite places as you can get a pretty delicious vegan boca patty substituted on any burger. I also am a big fan of anything bottomless. I appreciate the move to healthier side options like broccoli and salad, but often still go for the fries. My non veg friends have many choices for food items as well. They seem to have really improved on the menu and now offer quite a bit more than just the burgers and fries they are known for. I also really love that they use a nutrition calculator on their website which gives you the freedom to play with different items on your burger if you have particular dietary requirements you are trying to meet. Refills are always frequent and service is typically fast. Its even quicker now that you no longer have to wait to pay your check, and splitting a bill is so easy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale

The quality of food and customer service has gone down tremendously. The last two times I was there (apart from my most recent visit), I was given a bacon burger ... With NO bacon. Nota big deal, honestly - but when a manager comes over to talk to me about it and asks "" Well what do you want me to do about it?"" in a condescending manner I get annoyed.  My most recent visit was to celebrate my daughters birthday with family. I got bacon on my burger - yes! But my brother ordered their bleu cheese burger and received a burger with no bleu cheese. Fail once again Red Robin! I don't plan to visit again unless circumstances (and plans) are out of my control.

We waited for 10 minutes before we asked a waitress walking by if she was our waitress because we were ready to order drinks and no one had come up to serve us.

Also whats the deal with the endless fries?!  They lowered how much are actually delivered, approximately half of what they used to deliver.  It takes so long to get your regular food, so how are you going to get extra fries?  I wish I could say better things but I really can't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale

Red Robin's food has always left a lot to be desired and this was my first time at this specific location, but my kids absolutely love the place so we will dine at them on occasion.    Our server Michelle went above and beyond to make sure we had the absolute perfect dining experience on our last visit.  Her big smile and positive demeanor really left an impression on my wife and I. She was very attentive without being overbearing, extremely knowledgeable about the menu and had my kids rolling with laughter through our whole meal.  This is the type of experience I hope for when I go spend my hard earned money and makes me want to come back again sooner than later.

I also ordered a vegetarian patty instead of the regular patty, and let me tell you, that vegetarian patty changed my life. It tastes so much better, and it's free of charge to change!

Larry L.,"Miami Beach, FL",2,61,,2.0,2/4/2017,"Overrated and Overpriced. Service is always lackluster. $15 for a burger in Kitsap County is just to expensive. Basic burgers covered in enough goop to disguise the very average burger. Red Robin is creative in having a great business model to turn a cheap burger patty into something desirable by putting enough sauces pineapple and additional crap to distract you from the fact you just paid way too much in Kitsap County for a burger with an egg on it. We tried going here after several years of avoiding the restaurant mainly due to poor service in the past. Service was mediocre at best, once your burger is dropped off they are done with you until they try to up sell the deserts. Same rating as Denny's hmmmm what does that tell you? Excellent if you want balloons for the kids,high chairs and a great place to let the kids scream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=20
Karen M.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/8/2016,"I usually love Red Robin. It's one of my favorite places to eat. We recently moved back to this area and silverdale Red Robin is the only one in this area. After the last awful experience I said I wouldn't eat there again. Today is my birthday so my husband took me to lunch. He knows Red robin is normally a favorite and convinced me to give it another try. Maybe last time was a fluke. Wrong! We ordered appetizers, our meals and asked for a basket of fries (my meal came with fries), and the server said he was going to have to charge us extra for the fries. I've never ever had that happen when I already ordered a meal with fries. We went ahead and paid extra for more fries. We also asked for lots of ranch. He brought out one little container of watery ranch and the sorriest basket of fries I've ever seen. My husbands meal was brought out incorrect. The service and food were just blah. I wish I had gone somewhere else for my birthday lunch now. Two times in a row with bad service and mediocre/bad food.

Cody H.,"Bremerton, WA",0,2,,1.0,2/24/2016,"I never write reviews on restaurants, I dont know if you can see it anywhere but this is my first yelp review. Yep, my experience was bad enough that I signed up for yelp so I could hopefully save others from spending money on overpriced, thrown together food.  Took my wife and 2 kids since we knew they had remodeled we figured maybe the actual restaurant part had improved as well. We were seated quickly and thats where things went south. We waited about 10 minutes to see our server, at which time we ordered 4 waters and our food. We got a ranch/chips app, 3 burgers, and a kids pizza with a fruit cup side. 10 minutes later we got the chips, and my water was empty (keep this in mind). The chips themselves were fine, as was the dip, but there were about 3 other types of fried food bits with the chips as well as splattered oil all over the bottom of the plate. As a former fry cook in my highschool days, what this translates to is the fry cook went straight from basket to plate. After 10 minutes of eating our appetizer and an additional 10 minutes of waiting, we received our food, not from our server, but from another person. My crab cake burger consisted of the following: a crabcake, 4 spinach leaves, a squirt of sauce, and 3 sun dried tomatos stacked on top of each other (yes I counted because I couldnt believe I paid 15$ for this). The side of fries was 8 steak fries and more random fried food bits, again, yes I counted.  My wife's burger, which she ordered medium, was burnt and overcooked and the bottom bun was incredibly soggy from the bottom up, as though the plate was wet. She received about the same amount of fries I did. On the note of her fries, she paid an extra 1$ for the garlic fries, this consisted of about 1/4 teaspoon of parmesan cheese and non-existant garlic seasoning.  My daughter had the kid's pizza with a side of fruit salad, which came in a 2 oz plastic dipping cup ( this was a joke right? Like, haha we're kidding, here is some more!). She finished the fruit cup in 2 bites, the pizza she enjoyed.  My son's burger was the only thing that came out ok, he had a side salad with it and it was as expected. The person that brought our food was gone too quickly for me to request my water be refilled. Our server came to our table shortly after the food arrived and we ordered another order of fries for my wife and I, and another fruit side for my daughter. I also requested more water since mine had been empty over 25 minutes at this point.  We begin eating, and while the food didnt taste bad, I couldn't help but feel as though I was paying way too much money for what we were receiving, I mean the 2 burgers we (my wife and I) ordered were supposed to be Red Robins gourmet burgers, we paid 15$ each for these and I have received better looking burgers from Burger King.  About 15 minutes later, after we were nearly done, another person (who wasn't our server) delivered the fries. Once again they had other bits of fried food in them, mine had a couple of tortilla strips and a fried jalapeno slice and my wife's had a couple of jalapeno slices, what looked to be a fried mushroom and some bits of onion ring batter. They had forgotten my daughter's fruit cup, which since we had only seen our server twice at this point, we had to flag down another server to ask for. That came about 5 minutes later in an actual square ramekin, as it probably should have come in to begin with. At this point we just finished what we had on our plates, and since we had no hope of seeing our server in the near future, walked over to the server station to get a to go box for the fries. We used the little tablet thing, paid our bill and left. Remeber earlier when I said to keep in mind when my water was empty? It was still empty. This little visit, with terrible, non existent, service and thrown together food (seriously, the burger king near my house puts together burgers better and with more effort) cost me 60$. I will not be returning to Red Robin, nor will I recommend my friends or family to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=20
Claudia F.,"Frazier Park, CA",0,27,11,4.0,11/4/2016,Had a delicious California Chicken burger/sandwich the other night. It was a bit on the salty side. But I don't eat a lot of salty foods so I'm more sensitive than most. I had it on the wheat whole grain bun. Super yummy. I ordered with it the Freckled fruit. It was good but I think they use frozen strawberries. The mushy lifeless things were pretty inedible. But the other fruit was good. You know fresh berries or forget it. The service was great the waitress was very nice and a real Johnny on the spot. Before and during the renovations it was not very good.

Jennifer O.,"Renton, WA",45,12,5,1.0,1/2/2016,"Went here for lunch today thinking it was going to be like any other usual Saturday busy experience at Red Robin.  Boy, were we wrong. Waited the usual 15 minutes to be seated which was no big deal.  Place was insanely busy which was no big deal.  Lisa, our server, checked in with us quickly to get our drink order which was fine.  Noticed the kids menu no longer offers coloring pages or crayons to keep kids occupied, which is the first negative.  But that was just the start. Ordered a rather simple food for lunch.  Butter and cheese pasta for my daughter, a cup of the French Onion soup, the Turkey BLTA sandwich with fries and the Whiskey River BBQ Burger.  Not rocket science here. 45 minutes later.....soup arrives in a square bowl the size of maybe 2"" x 2"" and maybe 2"" deep with soup that was ICE COLD AND ROCK HARD.  But here's the kicker....no other food?!  Sit waiting and waiting and waiting another 15 minutes.  Ask about our food and was told very rudely by Lisa that it would be out when it was ready and the food runners would know when it was ready.  Ummmm ok? When our food comes out 20 minutes later, fries are ice cold, and kids pasta is CRUNCHY AND ICE COLD.  I mean seriously, how hard is it to boil pasta and throw some butter and cheese on this? When we called Rick, the manager, over, he was quick to point out he knew what the issues were and seemed to know this was an ongoing issue.  Ok, so if you know these are ongoing issues, why not fix them????  The table right across from is was rather ticked off too which was pretty funny too. It will definitely be a cold day in you know what before we return to this place.  Hopefully other people will have better experiences than we did.  What a shame how downhill this restaurant has gone......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=20

Kyle R.,"Kingston, WA",194,30,9,1.0,6/13/2015,Alright this is just ridiculous. My wife and I come in  all the time and order 1 burger to share and a root beer float to share. This time however our waitress informed us they were no longer allowed to cut our burger in half. Which is a little ridiculous I have literally never been to a place much less red Robin that would not cut my burger in half. It's basically standard at red Robin so I have no idea why it changed. But no my wife and I have to try and cut it our selves which you know isn't that hard but we for sure lose the aesthetics of the burger when we cut it our self.  OK so that was strike 1 Strike 2 was when we asked for a refill on our root beer float. And the waitress asked if we were sharing. When we said yes she refused to refill it. So let me get this straight if I am by myself I can order 10 if I wanted to and it would be fine and be the price of 1.  but if I want 2 to share between my wife and I cant. That is a really stupid policy and a policy I have never heard about until today and I have been coming here for YEARS.  Strike 3 is right after that she asked if we wanted more fries.

Cho D.,"Silverdale, WA",6,148,80,1.0,2/20/2016,"I couldn't like a location less. This has got to be the WORST Red Robin ever. We've (my husband and I) have gone three times. The first time we went we waited and waited. It was mid day on a Wednesday. Less then half of the tables were full. It took over 40 minutes to get a burger. Endless fries my a$$ the ones they brought were cold and grease laden. We ordered a second batch, and they came to the table after we paid. We got refills once on drinks. I just had water. Never got the extra napkins, or the ranch sauce we asked for. The waitress stopped by once. The other times we flagged down someone else, it was the waiter for the tables nearby. The bathroom smelled like putrid garbage. It was very dirty. Second visit. Busy as all get out. We waited, my husband wanted burgers. They sat us at a table. We were literally on top of the next table. They couldn't get out unless we moved.  We ordered a small app. The chips with ranch. We placed our order about 5 minutes later for our food. We got our drinks after about 20 minutes. After sitting there for 50 minutes we got our food, about 3 minutes later we got the ranch and chips. ARE YOU EFFING kidding me? No apology, no nothing she sat them down so fast the ranch spilled over, and she just turned around and went to talk to another table. My husband got the BBQ burger with a pineapple slice. There was so much BBQ on the burger he had to remove it with a spoon. We saw the waitress once after that. I was just a bad time. We had the wedges that night I believe, and they were the highlight. Okay so the final time. We had a 15 minutes wait. Maybe 20-30 people there. My guess is they didn't have enough staff. They sat us alone against that wall when you walk in. My husband ordered a burger again. I tried something new. I got the French dip. My husband ordered a long island. He was so grossed out by it. It tasted exactly like watered down lemonade and cheap gin. We ordered the chips with ranch again, because it's just the right size. This time we got it before our food, but it still took 20 minutes. Also they gave us about 10 chips. So we didn't even eat it. At this point I'm getting into a argument with my husband. The issue, ""Why do we keep coming back here? They ignore us, the food sucks, and the wait for everything is ridiculous."" When we finally get our food. His burger was char, and his fries were cold. I got sweet potatoes fries. They were old and tasted like they were dropped into grease for a second time. I could have rung them out. The au jus for my beef was Disgusting. It tasted like beef drippings mixed with a box of salt. The sandwich was exceptionally small. To be fare I'm from Chicago, a beef is three times as big, smothered in peppers and cheese, and dripping with au jus that taste like heaven. On a fresh French bread, with a golden crispy crust. This was gross. Again the service was so bad. Also there is a young woman (African American) or so I think. She is a hostess. Three of the waitresses had a nasty conversation about her. That my husband and I heard every word of. Save yourself the trouble. We tried out the Brewery across the parking lot. Same prices for burgers, small options but better meat, burger, taste, quality. Someone told me they were pricy. However we spend 15 on a burger at Red Robin, and the same at the Brewery, and they also have great service and bottomless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=40

Like felt bad for our server, as he looked pretty overwhelmed.  It took probably another half hour for our food, and by that time, we were starving.  When it finally arrived, our server couldn't even properly serve us. The tables were so close together, our tiny server couldn't get through to set plates. It was literally ""take one and pass it down."" Pretty sure I wasn't getting paid to serve food. Along with you burger, you get a half dozen fries, because they're ""bottomless.""  That is, if your overworked server actually has time to bring more. If he does, let's hope you're close to the people at your table, because you'll be sharing their ""bottomless"" fries.

To be quite honest, they should be glad that I never wrote a review in the beginning.  I worked at Red Robin after high school for a short time in Southcenter, my brother worked for the corporation for almost 10 years and at multiple locations, and the restaurant is a family favorite. My family and friends have celebrated countless birthdays at different Red Robin restaurants... While we have had imperfect experiences over the years, we have relatively high expectations because we know the company aims to satisfy high expectations. They seem to have a good team these days in Silverdale. My favorite server, hands down, is named Cody. We try to sit in his section whenever possible, and he seems to work a lot since we have been at many different times of day and he's nearly always there. Cody is friendly, extremely knowledgeable about the menu and options available, and attentive to no end. The matter how busy he is, he takes time to stop at your table and let you know what's going on with your order. I would say the one thing that they still need to work on is the hosting staff... They're not very warm and they often appear frustrated or frazzled. The last several times I've been there, you see them off to the side talking in hushed voices...

The food is pretty standard.  If you've been to Red Robin you know what to expect from the food.  If you haven't been to Red Robin, don't make this one your first experience. The service here is LOUSY, and as far as I can tell has been for years (we used to come to this location when we lived here before 5 years ago and nothing seems to have changed).   We've been in three times since we moved back (in the last few months) and the service is always slow (we know this and we NEVER come here when we are in any kind of hurry).  The last time we were in was the worst though.  First, we were not acknowledged at all when we came in, I had to walk up to the two girls ""hosting"" and wait while they finished their (not work related) conversation before they acknowledged I was there and took my name for the wait list (wait for a table was not too long).  They have changed the kids menus (they are now much like the regular menus and are not coloring pages, so there is nothing to entertain kids while you wait   for your food), our server did rustle up some old menu/coloring pages for our kids, but I don't know how long that will last.  Knowing this place is slow we always try to be ready to order the first time we see our server, so we placed our food order with our drink order.  Our drinks came relatively promptly (but were never refilled and two of us were just drinking water).  Our food took a long time (over 30 minutes), and when it came it was cold.  My chicken wrap was completely cold (the chicken should at least be warm) and it was dry (almost no BBQ sauce and almost no cheese) and my fries were cold.  My children's food was cold, COLD.  My husband's burger was cold AND overcooked and his fries were cold as well.  Also, they have changed the garlic parm fries which used to have real pieces of garlic, real shredded parm, and real parsley, they now have  some flavoring that comes out of a can, no real garlic flavor/pieces, no shredded parm, and no parsley, certainly NOT worth the extra $1 you pay for them (so, just don't).  Twice I made eye contact with the manager as he walked by but neither time did he ask how we were doing.  The server didn't even really stop to see how things were...it just feels like no one there cares if you have a good experience or if you ever return. We really like Red Robin's food (when it is cooked right and served hot) but this location is just bad, which is too bad because there aren't a ton of predictable food places in the area.   There are some non-chain options in the area, not as predictable with their food, but the service always seems better.  Like they care if they have and keep your business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=60

Rebecca H.,"Butte-Silver Bow, MT",0,1,,1.0,3/8/2016,"My granddaughter & I had lunch at this Red Robin today.  It took awhile for our order to be taken because our server was really busy.  Our food arrived and our burgers were really good.  My sweet potato fries were cold.  Our waitress checked on us and brought me some new hot fries.  So, I took the time to give her a good review on the video checkout.     While I was doing this, my 19 yr. old granddaughter went outside to have a cigarette while I paid the bill.  She calls me from the parking lot and tells me the cops pulled up and were accusing her of trying to steal a car or stuff out of a car.  You've got to be kidding was my reaction!!  I drive a non descript dark gray Kia Optima....there was the same style dark gray car parked one car away from mine with a white car in between.  She accidently went and stood next to the other dark gray car and smoked her cigarette. Then she went back into the restaurant to use the restroom while she was still waiting for me.  She went back out and realized she had been standing by the wrong dark gray car and found my dark gray KIA and stood next to it while she waited for me.  The man that owned the gray car one space away from mine, was watching all this from the restaurant and he got everyone convinced that my granddaughter was trying to steal cars or items from cars and then the Sheriff was called.  She had just had lunch at Red Robin with her grandmother!!      After the call from my granddaughter, I walked out to see two patrol cars and a Deputy standing with my granddaughter.  After hearing the accusations, I told the officer that the other gray car looked almost identical to mine and anyone could have made that mistake.  The 2nd officer came out of the restaurant and was very set on the fact that she was trying to steal something based on the overreaction of a customer(s).  That is the farthest thing from the truth!!!  She was merely waiting for me to finish my lunch and pay the bill. The older of two Deputies told my granddaughter that the manager has now band her from the Silverdale Red Robin and she will be arrested for trespassing if she ever returns.  I find this an extreme reaction to a simple misunderstanding.  Myself or my granddaughter never had a chance to speak with the manager before this decision was made.  My granddaughter is not a thief.  She is an excellent student with a clean record.  The Manager definitely should have handled this situation differently.  All he/she had to do was to ask my granddaughter if she was waiting for someone in the restaurant??? and all this could have been avoided....she was not loitering...she had just had lunch at Red Robin with her grandmother and was just waiting for me and having a cigarette. She is a typical 19 year old young lady and she was probably checking out her hair and makeup in the car window reflections, not casing the car(s).  Total misunderstanding fueled by a paranoid customer and handled poorly by management.  My granddaughter was humiliated and left with me, 'in tears' .....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=60

As far as food goes, it was alright, my wifes food was under cooked and my sons fruit salad was questionable with non edible previously frozen mush strawberries and was seriously skimped on the famous bottomless fries i had asked for more for myself and wife and was eyed by the server. Then the server was of course, extremely prompt and confrontational, after seeing we left no gratuity. He approached us with arms crossed clearly upset asked if their was a problem and how the food was, but im sure he knew the answer to both of those questions.

Instead, we just didn't get charged for nachos we couldn't eat because there was someone else's hair on them. .. no replacement and no apology from management.

Valerie H.,"Bremerton, WA",0,20,8,3.0,8/21/2011,"So I am not a fan of their steak fries, at all. In fact, I try to avoid this place and I'm usually pretty good at doing that.  Anyway, my family had a get-together here for some special occasion so I decided to drag myself along. Their gourmet burgers are good, I never have a problem with that but I just cannot stand their steak fries. So when I saw that they offered Sweet Potato fries as a substitution, I literally heard angels singing as light broke through the clouds! haha..  I ordered the Pub Burger with a little pink in the middle. This burger has ale-braised onions and mushrooms, creamy peppercorn-ranch, melted Cheddar and Swiss cheese, and fresh tomatoes served on a toasty onion bun. Um yes, DELICIOUS. Okay so it didn't have a little pink in the middle, whatevs. The burger was still pretty moist so I'm OK with that!  The sweet potato fries were great! Well, they were great up until I got to the bottom of the tray and saw that they were swimming in a lot of oil. Pretty unappetizing... but the fries were still YUMMY! lol... I'm sure I can get past that by dodging the fries that were soggy beyond rescue from the oil they were sitting in.  We always get the Onion Tower to start because really, who doesn't love deep fried onion rings dipped in Red Robin sauce? If I wasn't so turned off by their fries, I'd totally go there more often. But oh well!  Staff is friendly, atmosphere is great for children and adults alike. Decor reminds me of a hoarder trying to make random pieces ""mesh well"" on the wall.

Eric R.,"Bremerton, WA",13,5,2,2.0,9/1/2014,"Ok, so you can usually tell when you get the waiter or waitress that is new because of their inability to let you ask for something before they zip out of existence - or spill a drink - or make an excuse about how long the bottomless fries will take - and all of this in perhaps the first 10 minutes after being seated. What I dont get is why you wait for a table for 10-15 minutes, and then you sit down, only to have to wait another 10 minutes for horrible service. The thing is, I realize it's NOT fast food - so when I'm paying an average of 12 dollars for a burger and 3-5 dollars a drink, I do expect good service, and that's just the things on the menu. Am I right? So it's been 23 minutes an we've gotten fries, only to have devoured the measly baby portion in 2 min. Serious, how can they boast bottom less, when they come out of the gate saying ""it's a dinner crowd and excuse excuse excuse!"" I'm like, ok...hire a new cook team and bring in reserves, you should know by now, people like your food, and I as many am sacrificing service and wait time for that delicious campfire sauuuuce smothered on just about anything. Ok, ten minutes later and a second drink refill is finally here, but a server zipped away before I could ask for sugar. 101 for tips, always ask- ""is there anything else I can get you?"" ....I at this point am feeling bad and ask for more sugar. Duh, the table has none and you're bringing me tea. I robbed the table behind me (exhausted from getting up), and now the kids who ordered the 5 dollar root beer floats are being told the ice cream machine is ""running slow"". So- the food comes, still no shake for the wife- 30 min later and still no refills for kids. Sad. I don't know if I feel more sorry my family who are patiently full of sad face and disappointment or my fellow red robin employees who simply don't care. I even took a picture of my sons colossus burger...the sadness in his eyes cries why me father? What did I do to deserve this? For the love of god! And even the bun was wrong (they ran out of white). Wait! All drinks have arrived, my wife has almost finished her meal. The sadness in her eyes is compounded by unexplainable tears. The great red robin would be clucking in his grave knowing the disservice bestowed upon us. What they lack in service they make up for in food quality....but you'll wait. And you may have to ask 4 times for your shake, from several employees. Note to Red Robin, forget the birthday clapping and work on customers. Hint, the birthday people don't tip. At this point the salt and sugar has kicked in and almost all is forgotten on a weak attempt at service, now we wait for the check. A whopping $60 later, and I feel like I could have gotten the same thing from Micky Dees for 1/4 the price and 1/4 the time.

I can honestly say this was the worst dining out experience I've ever had!!  First we waited 35 minutes to be seated (expected to wait, no biggie) than once we were seated we waited over an hour for our food. When our food came out my daughters didn't, and only half of her friends did (9 & 10 year old hungry kids) I ordered chicken on a stick for my 10 month old and his chicken was raw, still pink in the middle!! All 3 the burgers us adults (one pregnant) had ordered were also on the raw side, we complained and explained how we had ordered them (2 ""little"" pink 1 no pink) we than waited 20 minutes for our order to be corrected... when it came back all were ""super well done"" like burnt hockey pucks!! So we have not waited 2 hours for nasty food that was uneatable... We honestly should have just walked out with out paying, but didn't. We paid and left starving!! I will never return. Who serves raw food to an infant and a pregnant woman? Here's a tip... Cook your food properly the first time, and you won't get behind having to fix orders. Also the bathrooms were NASTY!! only one stall had toilet paper, no paper towels, and a few stalls didn't lock. When we told the hostess she just rolled her eyes at me and said ""yeah! I know"" Well excuse me for letting you know.. I know there was a 20 minute gap from when my daughter and her friend went in and informed us, than I went in and found it in the same condition... if she knew than someone should have done something about it.

Ceilings are supposed to absorb sound, not reflect it.  The three intoxicated teen-adults at the bar were heard by all.  The only saving grace was that they occasionally drowneded out the two screaming babies we had to listen to...while in the bar. - I only ordered two items, hot wings (clucks or something) and a salad, both with ranch dressing.  The wings used to be better; these were just winglets...no drumsticks, and the red sauce was oily and nasty.  The salad, when I eventually received it (yes, I had to ask for it after the hot wings had arrived), had wilted lettuce and the dressing was blue cheese. - The draft beer was only moderately cold, not 32 degrees like some places these days. Overall, this may be the last time I go to Red Robin...at least, this Red Robin.  I would consider going back, but only after they changed their food, upgraded their taps, hired a better staff, and totally demolished the building and rebuilt it so the bar doesn't sound like a freaking daycare center.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=100

It starts with the greeting staff - always courteous, fast, and efficient. You should have seen them on Veteran's Day - packed because of the Vet special + the Seahawk Red Zone deal on same night!  Yet, they were incredibly effective in getting everyone a table in a reasonable time while keeping a smile on their faces. A special shout-out for our favorite server - Cassy.  She rocks!  Always on the go and never forgets to bring anything. She is top-notch.

I had an inclining that things wouldn't go well when we sat in the bar and no-one said so much as hi to us for 15 minutes.  We should have left then.  The service was abysmal, and the food was mediocre.  We were ""served"" (if that's what you dare call it) by Charles, who took a long time to greet us, a long time to take our order, never brought silverware or napkins, and didn't bring our food (which came cold and soggy) for 50 minutes.  I guess he probably had some alcohol he was serving elsewhere with expectations of higher tips.   My husband ordered a chicken wrap with a cup of chili.  The wrap had no visible chicken, and was quite small and overwhelmed with mediocre bbq sauce.  He says they must've been scraping the bottom of the chili can to come up with the three tablespoons of bad chili that came in his cup. I ordered a mushroom burger.  It came cold and soggy, and when I looked inside I found canned mushrooms.  I asked the guy who brought the food (not Charles) if they used canned mushrooms, and he adamantly denied having any canned food at the restaurant, but immediately brought out a cup (fuller than my husband's chili) of cooked mushrooms that were fresh, not canned.  The burger was tasteless, grey, and cold, the bun was mushy from sitting in (I have to assume) canned mushroom goo on the plate for who knows how long, the Swiss cheese was either non-existent or flavorless.  I made the mistake of paying for bacon, which was also pretty flavorless. We were stunned by too much Christmas shopping and made the mistake of eating the meal and paying for it.  Twenty minutes later the heartburn started.

When I got my burger is was nice and hot, had a good amount of lettuce, the cheese looked nice and melted and there were plenty of pickles which really makes me happy! The fries were a little cold, but we were too hungry to even care. We ordered some of their Mozzarella sticks and got them within 15 minutes. They were alright, I've definitely had better. They were also a little cold. My husband got the A.1 Peppercorn and he really likes it. He said it was juicy and filling. My burger was a little tasteless, even adding the red robin seasoning didn't do much. But, again I was too hungry to really care, or even notice. Our waitress came to check on us about 2 or 3 times, just brought extra napkins (my husband is a messy eater). She just brought us drinks when she seen we were getting low. I really enjoyed our time here. The food could've been more hot, and better tasting... But hey I don't expect much from a chain restaurant. Our last experience was awful though! (different waitress) They lost our order and we were there for 2 hours. They kept bringing us fries to keep us from starving to death, but never gave us any discounts for the trouble or anything free. Our meals had fries already so I'm kind of wishing they would've offered something else with our meals (we ate our weight in fries, lol)  Today's experience was a different story though, we had a good time. No long waits, the waitress was fast, friendly, and helpful. She got a well deserved tip. My advice to Red Robin, is to stop spending so much money creating a new menu every few months and spend your money making your tasteless food have it's great taste back.

We found a booth. They had just opened. Couldn't really tell who our server was. There were about six, standing near the flatware station arguing which person had which tables. As it turned out we were delivered a menu from one server, our order was taken by another, our food was delivered by another, and we had to ask another to take the order for more fries. Our burgers came pretty fast. Problem was there were only 8 fries on my plate, and 12 on my wife's. Ya, we counted them. Couldn't believe they were so tight with the fries. C'mon Red Robin. This is what you do. Put more fries on the plate. Burgers were good. My wife had the Banzai and I had the Tavern Double.  Hers had a little too much grease on the bottom bun, but otherwise she enjoyed it. We were done with the burgers and first fries about 10 minutes before a server popped up close enough to us to take an order for more fries. We weren't allowed to order them up front, or we would have. So, Red Robin, we like your burgers. Fix the fry situation. Fix the server situation.

Stan G.,"Port Orchard, WA",12,53,46,1.0,10/18/2011,"I said before this place was mediocre. I apologize to all the mediocre places I insulted by comparing them to this Red Robin.  Ate there yesterday. Service, poor. The family at the table next to us gave up and left without ever seeing a server. Mind you, this was mid afternoon, not crowded.  We got nachos. Far and away the worst nachos I have ever seen. Not fit to be eaten by humans (although they did use fresh jalapenos, not jarred. That was cool). Daughter ordered 'queso' dip. It appeared to be velveeta with chunks of burger patty in it. Seriously. Something an eight year old would make you for father's day, and you would slyly dump in the trash.  And the server constantly bugged us about signing up for some rewards card. When we finally agreed, some computer glitch made it take over ten minutes. We left the reward card on the table, because we won't be back.  One star because zero is not an option.  PS - the beer list sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=140
Stephen J.,"Port Orchard, WA",4,156,,3.0,7/31/2012,"This is the first time I had been to a Red Robin in 8 years and this first time I had been to this particular one. It was just as I remembered it. Very crowded and noisy. The prices were a little high. The selection for burgers was very good and the bottomless fries were nice but the service was slow. Only when I was ready to leave did the second portion of french fries show up. The parking is the mall parking so no problem there. It is not a bad place to go, but I know of quieter place to have a meal. I don't have any plans to return anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=140

Mandi S.,"Silverdale, WA",0,16,3,2.0,5/29/2015,"We were pretty disappointed in this Red Robin. After being overseas for three years, I was really looking forward to RR again. We were seated pretty quickly which wasn't surprising because we got there pretty late for dinner - maybe 8:30? We ordered onion rings as an appetizer and a couple of burgers for our meals. When our burgers came, we asked about the onion rings and the waitress admitted that she forgot to put them in ... so we didn't get them. Both mine and my husband's food came out cold (the burgers and fries) but my burger was still really good ... of course a hot burger would have been better. It was my birthday, so my husband of course found our waitress somewhere and asked for them to sing to me. She totally forgot about it ... so when she brought the check he just asked her in front of me if they were still planning on singing. The service was TERRIBLE. I love RR food, but unfortunately had an awful experience at this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=140
Sam S.,"Seabeck, WA",1,12,,3.0,12/6/2010,"The burgers are pretty good, and the turkey burger is great. The service is not so great. The ""greet staff"" appears to change with each visit and generally has the IQ of a grape. Several times they have forgotten I was sitting there, awaiting a take-away order. Once I was so mad I stormed the kitchen and gave them an earfull - they immediately made amends by apologising profusely and giving me a free meal. I have been told by others to go to the bar & place your order there because you'll be talking to a grown up who has a sense of responsibility and an attention span of more than 2 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=140

Waverly F.,"Poulsbo, WA",0,10,4,4.0,1/25/2009,"I could live on their steak fries...:-) service was friendly and efficient, but on a Saturday afternoon the noise level was worse than a Kiss concert on steroids.  (just wondering out loud: do parents of toddlers who scream non stop just tune them out, and if so, do they realize other people can't?) I mean, c'mon parents, this is a family atmosphere, but it's isn't freakin' Chuck E Cheese!!  We will take the advice written previously to sit in the bar next time. Apparently the day we were there it was everyone in the world's birthday, and the birthday clapping song was cute the first time....it gets old fast. My companion threatened to tell the server it was my birthday. (it wasn't) I threatened to decorate him with his malted.  End of discussion. My companion had the shrimp and cod, thumbs up on the shrimp, the cod not so much.  The breading was tasty but the fish itself was not. His malted was excellent, and seemingly neverending.  I had the Gourmet Cheeseburger, and the server asked if I wanted ""no pink"" or ""a little pink"" and it took me a moment to realize she was asking how I wanted it cooked.  I said a little pink.  Oops, I should have asked her to define ""little""....not her fault, it was just a bit too rare for my taste.  My mistake, not hers.  Tip: ask for extra napkins, you're going to need them. Over all the food was great, it's a fun place, but next visit (and we will return as soon as our arteries unclog) we will sit in the bar and pray it is an off day for birthdays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=160

Carly M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",19,102,11,1.0,7/14/2010,I have been to many Red Robins all over the country and had no problems. But I have been to this one 3 times and have gotten sick every time.

Kim D.,"San Jose, CA",489,603,6,3.0,4/9/2008,"I've worked at Red Robin and it's different to see how it translates from what you know. The service was okay, the server was a bit stand-offish. The Spinach Dip at Red Robin is the best I've ever had, because it has the element of cream to it which makes it perfect. We sat down for some drinks and appetizers and that's what we got. I'll have to say the fact they managed to charge me for extra bread for my spinach dip is kind of dumb. I'm not cheap, but they have never done it before and the server was weirdly rude about such a concept when it should have been the other way around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=160

Adrian R.,"Bremerton, WA",54,255,9,2.0,8/3/2009,"Yawn... It's Red Robin. The only reason to go there is if your with a group of friends and you want something that everyone can sorta agree on that serves alcohol in the area. Other than that what's the point? It's crowded. Loud. The waits can be really long unless you sit in the bar area. The food is only ok at best. Nothing I would rave about to anyone. Speciality drinks are so sweet they hurt. Burgers are alright to decent but don't even come close to other options in the area. The score is saved by bottomless fries and excellent service. The people working there are kind attentive and I've even gotten a few free beers there, but with that said the noise and crowd make for more of a headache than dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=160
