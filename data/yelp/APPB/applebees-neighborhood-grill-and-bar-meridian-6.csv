Tasha C.,"Moundville, AL",0,17,7,3.0,1/6/2018,Stopped to eat while driving through.  Service was not bad but our waitress felt the need to cancel our mozzarella cheese sticks because we also ordered the wings. Guess u can't order both here or get what u ordered & wanted! Ha!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Kaye L.,"Norfolk, VA",0,13,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Wrong order delivered; service is poor.  Server disappeared and according to her smell upon her return, she was smoking.  Sad food and atmosphere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Khondker I.,"Meridian, MS",493,99,448,3.0,3/15/2017,Love chicken tortilla soup! The best. Thai shrimp salad is awesome. Just ate one scoop of ice cream. Fantastic. Now I have to run 20 miles to burn all calories.  But the service is very slow. I could take a power nap before the food is served.  I ordered salmon today. The piece was very small,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
J G.,"Lumberton, TX",0,22,2,2.0,8/26/2017,If I'm honest my experience here did not meet my expectations. The staff was very nice but the food disappointed. My appetizer and meal arrived at the same time. The appetizer wasn't really warm. And my salad did not have a fresh feeling. The place was very busy so maybe I just got a dud.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Ramona M.,"Raymond, MS",94,5,3,4.0,1/13/2017,"The food was great and correctly heated, waitress was a little slow but I will stop here again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Alanna Y.,"Shubuta, MS",0,3,,1.0,10/25/2016,"The last two times we have been, the service has been absolute crap. This past time we were seated by the manager and then it took the waitress forever to come get our drink order.  We gave her our order at the same time as our drink order and it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks because she got off and they never sent us another waitress. I had to call someone to the table. She was nicer and checked on us a lot. Our food came out completely wrong though. It took another 30 minutes for them to fix it. Worst experience ever. This has happened the past 2 times and I refuse to go back. They did give us $5 off our ticket and a card for a free appetizer, but that doesn't make up for crappy service the last 2 times. Avoid this place at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
An W.,"Meridian, MS",0,14,,4.0,6/11/2017,Depending on your taste most of the food is really good.  You also have to get there early or after the rush at lunch in order to get your food in a timely manner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Shelley V.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,4.0,3/27/2017,Great food at lunch and prompt service. Special was hamburgers and they were big and delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Monica S.,"Metairie, LA",37,5,2,1.0,2/18/2017,"My family and I chose to eat here after a day of shopping and it was a bad choice. First our apps came out 45 mins after ordering them and the food was cold. Shortly afterwards our kids' meals came out and everything was good. We were told that our food wood be out shortly. One hour passed, still no food for adults. We asked for the manager. Not once, but twice. 30 mins later, we started packing up getting ready to walk out. At this time ALL of our food came out. We advised the waiters that we were no longer interested in staying and that they can take the food back. At that time the manager came out to apologize for the service we received and about the wait time for our food. This was by far the worst experience we've ever had and the manager avoiding us speaks volumes about their perception of customer service. We paid for the kids meals and cold appetizers but that will be the last dime we spend with this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Wes B.,"Daphne, AL",10,6,8,4.0,4/18/2016,Fast friendly service . Three cheese cavatappi is well seasoned. Large portion for the hungry. Would recommend this item.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Dale P.,"Seabrook, TX",0,36,,1.0,8/18/2016,"A memorable meal; not in a good way. Most of the meal was OK, but the broccoli was so salty it was uneatable. Asked for some without salt, more arrived too salty to eat; and they charged us for the extra broccoli. I like salt; but this was in a thick brine that was painfully salty. Add in a disinterested waitress and we were glad to get out of this place. I am not expecting 5 star food or service at Applebees, but I am expecting eatable. This place has management/people problems. Solution: Restaurant for Sale!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Secret C.,"Washington, DC",1,69,23,2.0,8/14/2015,"I know what you are thinking, it is a chain and I should not be expecting too much. The food was definitely average. I ordered from the happy hour menu and my food arrived cold. I returned the boneless wings because they were awful. The manager came by to apologize and removed it from our bill, I did appreciate that.  My husband ordered the steak and his portion looked like a kids' meal. He said it didn't taste that great either, we should have stuck with the burgers. Overall, the dining was just ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Cameron C.,"Philadelphia, MS",15,8,,5.0,12/20/2015,"This place is awesome! Every time we go out of town and come here we just have to have lunch here at least one time! I haven't really got much to say about this place but all I can say is this: If you eat here, make sure you can leave and tell yourself that you've made the right choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Dessalines H.,"New Orleans, LA",0,1,1,4.0,6/21/2016,"Wonderful place, nice atmosphere however there was a wait to get a table but there was wonderful food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Will C.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,3,,1.0,8/11/2016,I would give this place 0 stars if I could... Worst food and service.. Manager was busy flirting with a girl at the bar and the waiter took too long to bring us our food and our change. Avoid this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Sarah M.,"Chillicothe, OH",9,15,8,1.0,4/4/2016,"Agh! Worst Applebee's experience ever! I'm a foodie and don't expect too much from a chain. But dang! This was bad. After traveling all day and checking into a hotel within walking distance, we decided to get food to go. I kept it simple. A cheeseburger, baked potato and a shake. I requested extra lettuce & mayo on the side. The burger looked like it had been sitting for a while. I got a sinkage sliver of lettuce... Not even a dull leaf... Definitely not extra, a slice of tomato that was mostly stem and had a dried piece of lettuce stuck to it... (Found the ""extra"" lettuce!) Just gross. 1 single ring of onion. All of which piled on top of the bun... Like on top of the top bun. (?) resulting in a wet bun. Oh yeah, no mayo on the side. The baked potato looked like it had sat all day. Half of the skin was missing... Exposing a dried, cracked potato. Like a rock. I didn't even try the shake at that point. I called the manager. She offered to make it again. I didn't even want a cheeseburger at that point. I decided that she just had to see the food that I got. I got dressed and took it over. She looked at it, refunded part of my money. She really should have offered a gift card or something for my trouble in my opinion. Either way, I took my refund to Waffle House and had a super fresh and delicious meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Jason J.,"Morgantown, WV",226,384,224,3.0,6/1/2014,"The service was good, even got $3 off by taking a quick survey. We ordered the strawberry avocado salad and it was okay but it literally looked like we got one strawberry and a 1/4 of an avocado on each salad, so it wasn't a great value overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Patrick G.,"Trussville, AL",38,54,73,3.0,5/17/2014,"The menu changes have been a welcome delight. However, get there early, they lunch specials aren't prepared fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Casey R.,"Atlanta, GA",0,6,,1.0,5/30/2014,"I came in tonight with my family, and I'm leaving a bit disappointed.  The service wasn't very good, I'm hoping my server was new..otherwise there was no excuse for that. The food didn't come out in a timely manner and half of it was cold, either really over seasoned or bland. I hardly ever complain, but this pretty much sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Mike P.,"Clinton, MS",5,17,1,1.0,8/17/2011,No service after being seated for 20 minutes restaurant wasn't too busy lots of open tables they just didn't want my money so I left and went to logans next door.  Its sad to see that the staff were enjoying thier conversations with each other than to keep the customers happy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6
Jonathan L.,"Harvest, AL",1,5,6,4.0,8/5/2010,"I don't like chain reatraunts, but staying in Meridian, MS theres not many other options. Large bar area and occasional promo nights. If you are here during football season, def go here, tons of flatscreens. The night we were there they had live entertainment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-meridian-6?start=20
