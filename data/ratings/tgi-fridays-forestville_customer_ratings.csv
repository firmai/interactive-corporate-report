55,M W.,"District Heights, MD",0,16,1.0,1.0,2013-03-13,"Our first visit was shortly after they opened and on New Years Day.  We waited for a table for 30 minutes and were then eventually seated at a table in the bar area -- that had been open and clean the entire time we waited.  After sitting at the table for an additional 15 minutes, with employees passing by us not even stopping to say ""someone will be right with you"", I had to go back to the ""hostess"" and ask for either a server OR a manager.  We were told that there was no manager on the premises (I called BS on that one immediately), but a server would be there within a minute.  After another 10 minutes sitting at the table with no server paying any attention to us, I yelled to the hostess ""IS THIS BECAUSE WE ARE WHITE AND GAY?!?!?""  Surprisingly, a manager appeared out of nowhere and was from one corner of the restaurant to our corner faster than I could blink!  Finally got to order a meal, it showed...but not what we ordered. We went back and forth with the server and manager just trying to get a meal and to give them a shot.  We never did get what we ordered and left with only a drink tab (the drinks were weak to boot!).  Fast forward 15 months and we decided to give them another shot.  I wanted a burger, bad, and we had received a coupon in the mail from them.  We showed up and, while they were busy, we were seated almost immediately.  Ironic as it was, it was the same table we were seated at on our prior visit.   Luckily, we ordered an appetizer platter of wings, cheese stick things and their new soft pretzels.  I only had the pretzels, but the partner cleared the platter of the wings and cheese rather quickly.  He was either hungry, or they were good.  The pretzels were OK (Smokey Bones are much, much, much better -- but these were edible).  The partner and I both ordered burgers, cooked medium.  While we waited and waited, I told my partner that I did not have a good feeling about the experience.  One thing was that one person took our drink order, another person brought it to us.  The first person took our appetizer order, someone else brought it to us.  First person took our food order and, well, you get the picture.  Our burgers finally arrived and they were way past well done and burnt.  ""Charred"" is one thing, burnt is another.  Our server zoomed past us at the speed of light, twice, to ask how the food was...but couldn't be bothered enough to wait for a response.  When she finally came back, to give us the check, we were told ""Oh, they won't cook any lower than medium well"". That's fine and dandy if that is their policy....BUT, tell me that when I order and I will make my own decision on that dish OR have the opportunity to order something else. I understand that TGIF is about fun, music, sports, etc. but maybe, just maybe, had they not been blaring music so loud that you cannot hear the person sitting across from you, dancing around, hugging each other and making balloon animals (yes, balloon animals!) -- you may be able to effectively provide decent service to your customers. Also, side note to the girl with the clipboard at the door:  You may think that your blue laser ring is ""cute"", but when it is periodically blinding people while you dance around to the music...not so cute. Don't even get me started on the parking lot!!  Let's just say ""ill conceived, tiny, and a little paint with arrows or lines would make it so that you have less accidents there"". (There were several while we were there). So, bottom line, if you have a hankering for T. G. I. Friday's -- stay far away from this s-hole and go to the one in Bowie, Greenbelt or Cap Center.  This one is a waste of building materials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=80,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

Yes, TGIF is a chain of restaurants but the quality of the food and the service can be a little hit or miss depending on location. So i stroll into this spot at basically the last minute. They closed at midnight I got there a little after 11pm. I had just finished chilling with my friends and needed a little something, something on my stomach before hitting the road to go home. I was starving like Marvin so I ordered a little of everything lol so here's the list; Seared Tuni Appetizer - oddly enough it was topped with a little guacomole and jalepeno pepper. I dont know what it was about that combination but it was pretty darn yummy and worth getting again. Meatballs Appetizer - oh these are just simply delicious! I get them every time I go to Fridays. They drench it in this yummy goodness marinara sauce with Parmesan cheese *drooling as I type* Mac N Cheese Bites - Appetizer - Aaaahhh one word AWESOME!! Fried perfectly on the outside, bite into a perfectly seasoned and cheesy mac and cheese - couldn't get any better than this!  Steak and Ribs Main Meal - The ribs were fall off tender and very tasty. I am VERY PICKY about my steak. I ordered it Medium and it was almost cooked well done. When I order medium I expect to see a little pink. Off the note the steak was ok.  Ultimate Margarita with Sugar Rim - good drink  Customer service was good. Our waiter was ok. Overall I would go here again.

52,Tia G.,"Washington, DC",59,53,19.0,1.0,2013-12-31,"Worst Fridays location I've been to thus far.  I met up with some friends who were already seated and enjoying drinks and meals in a booth. I look for the waiter to order, he makes eye contact then walks over, I open my mouth he says ""hold on"" and walks off....hmmm, ok. He comes back 4 or 5 mins later I give him my order, ask for extra sauces off top as not to be a bother later on he nods walks off again before I can even ask for a drink or glass of water. Food comes 15 mins later, no extra sauces so I ask again, and ask for water as well, he nods, no apologies, comes back with sauces, no water *sigh*. I wait for him to come back. he doesn't until its check time...so this whole time I've been without a beverage. Checks come, I pay mine separately with my card, the others pay in cash, we wait for the receipts....manager comes over and asks whose card # ends with ****, I say me, he proceeds to tell me that the entire bill had been accidentally charged to my card by the waiter because he hasn't learned how to split checks, but its really like a hold so the money PROBABLY wont come out of the account, it just wont be available for 48 to 72 hours....Whatttt? So I tell him that's an inconvience for me and ask how he plans to remedy the situation, he tells me with a straight face ""there's nothing I can really do""...Sir, you tried it! There is plenty you can do. You can comp my food, offer me food, beverages, give a certificate etc....there are options, I shouldn't have even had to ask a manager with great customer service would have offered to options to show they were sorry and wanted to make the situation better for the customer. He then goes on to say ""free food wont put the money back on your card"" *gasp* I had to clutch my pearls to keep from laying into his ass. I demanded compensation for my inconvience and he reluctantly gave me two free appetizer cards....SMH...I was done battling.

These bartenders feel entitled to treat their guests like this because they think they're better than those they serve. They need a reality check.

53,Michael G.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,2014-08-05,"Worst TGIF location ever (5740 Silver Hill Rd. District Heights, MD), thank goodness we were only visiting the area DC.  We will never go back or recommend this location.  My wife, daughter and I arrived at about 10:15 pm. on Sunday the 3rd of August and waited about 50 minutes for a table.  Finally, after sitting at the table for 15 minutes with several servers walking by to include the waiter for our section. A waiter that we later found out was our waiter, stopped at the table right next to us and looked right at me but didn't bother stop by to say anything like ""someone will be right with you or would you like something to drink"".  I then witnessed what appeared to be an argument between the manager and the waiter about who was supposed to be serving us, after several more minutes passed with no one paying any attention to us I was done with this.  Had I known the area and it was not 11:30 at night we would have just left and ate elsewhere.  At this point I told my wife we would just place an order to go and eat on the bed in the hotel room. Which was something we were trying to avoid having to do. I walked up to the hostess and told her I was done waiting and was going to just place an order to go. She walked me back to where I needed to place the order and told two employees that I was upset with the lack of service I had received to this point.  After placing my order (Parmesan-Crusted Chicken, Triple Stack Reuben and Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich without bacon) one employee called the manager over and told him what had taken place and ask him to discount the bill. I continued to witness deplorable behavior of the employees, to include one waitress walking up to the food service window which was about 8 feet away and yelled at the cooks ""N**** I need my food now""  to which the manager simply turned his head and told her to stop.  I also got to witness firsthand waiters/waitress running around playing grab ass, throwing ice at each other and down the waitress shirts and dancing around like they are out on the town and not a place of business working for a pay check.  When the manager was done discounting my bill, he just walked away without even apologizing for what I overheard or my overall terrible experience.  This is something I place directly on the lack of management of this TGIF location. If all of this was not bad enough once we got back to the room my wife's Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich was wrong, they did leave the bacon off as I asked but forgot the Cajun-spiced fried onion strings and Jack Daniel's mayo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=80,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001

The drinks were horrible and I almost puked after witnessing one of the bartenders sneeze in her hand and wipe her nose with the same hand and continued to make drinks. I immediately sent my drink back and hightailed it out of there. So disgusting. I will never return again!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=60,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.7640000000000002,2.04

My husband and I ordered Corona-Rita's and the drinks tasted more like a bottle of Corona dumped in a glass of ice water. I've NEVER sent a drink back, but I refused to drink that.

47,R M.,"Laurel, MD",1,4,4.0,1.0,2015-02-21,The hostess was extremely rude in how she approach our party.  When stating we should order to go due to the wait she was not clear on where we were to go to place an order.  The best service was from another hostess or server who apologized and listened to the concerns of our group and another group ahead of us.  There is no electronic system in the back for to go orders.

88,Tisha S.,"Capitol Heights, MD",538,341,214.0,1.0,2015-02-24,"So we came here after my Bedroom Kandi party as we were starving! I arrived 1st at about 640 and was told after i told in front of the ""hostess"" for a few mins and watch him take others reservations before mine that the wait for 7 people was 40 to 60 mins. I said ok. He said he couldn't start the clock till 4 people get here...Normally they won't seat you till at least half are here. He said it with such a attitude i began to get annoyed. I sat down to wait and 4 of the party showed up. I went back to the ""hostess"" and told him that he could start the clock as we have 5 folks here. he gave me a kinda dismissive look and said ok. MInd you this is at 645. We didn't get seated till about 750pm after three of us went up there to ask what was going on. He stepped out once to call for a party and we got his attention and asked him how long the wait for Spencer is. He said ""I told you it was 45 to 60 mins"" We said, no we asked how long is the wait now. He looked at his ""clock"" and you have 39 mins"" with an attitude. At this point everyone was pissed with how he was talking to us. I watched as he told others how long the wait time was and when they walked out he had a look of disgust like ""we don't need your service anyway"". It took going up there, walking around seeing 4 booths open, talking to managers, and talking to him. he even tried to get into an argument with one of our party. This hostess needs to be fired. he had a Queen attitude and the head flipping and the way he spoke to people like he was better than folks is unwanted. He needs to understand he is the 1st thing that customers see when they come in. So after getting seated in the Bar (which the hostess didn't want to seat us there either, he kept acting like he didn't want to seat us at all. We had to tell him we didn't mind the two tables. He also said that you can't just sit in the bar area unless its the seats at the bar not surrounding the bar. MInd you after sat within about 15 mins another couple sat next to us without a hostess and later told the employee that told them the reason they weren't getting served was because they had to be seated, they told him, they were told they could sit there by someone up front.), we waited on the waitress. Her name was RaRa. it was very clear she was busy not only taking orders but also making all the drinks. She ordered my chips and salsa as i am a rewards member before taking a single drink or food order. It came out 30 mins later after another person's appetizer that was order 10 mins after the chips, and asking another manager for chips. This manager in a red shirt started bringing out our drinks about 10 mins after we ordered and all we asked for was water and two sodas. why was he bringing a glass here and there, maybe two glasses. the bar was two steps away. when we kept telling him we missing drinks, as he was acting like that was it each time, he responded ""they are coming, they coming"". Well after sitting for so long, we was getting upset and thirsty not to forget starving. so both appetizers came out, an we didn't have napkins, forks or anything. So i went tot he hostess stand to get some silverware and the the ""hostess"" was like ""uh huh, no ma'am you can't just come up here and take stuff"" I said, ""well we have been sitting over there for almost 45 mins and we haven't been giving anything"" He was like ""well you need to ask first"". I said I shouldn't have had to ask as they should have came with us when we were sat down. Mind you he did not even follow me or anything to bring us silverware. I went to the bar to our waitress and asked for some. When we got them they were all dirty and water stained. so we asked for plastic instead.  It was 8 o'clock before we received our main meals. At this point we had already begun to talk to a different manager, Rasheem (i think that how you spell it). he sat down and listened to everything we had to say and wasn't pleased. Especially since he is the hostess manager. As i was talking about the ""hostess"" he kept looking at me and making comments. I told the manager if i see him keep giving me side eyes glances we going to have a problem.  While we were talking Rara came up and told the manager to check our food as it didn't look right. So when it came out all the burgers were overcooked, one was missing onions, one had the sauce on the burger when requested on the side, fries were cold and one pasta wasn't even made with the cajun seasoning and wasn't a real alfredo sauce. oh yeah they were all reheated in the microwave. I didn't even eat my burger just the bacon. I had also order a drink to come with my food, never came, and we never got refills of waters or 2nd rounds of stuff.   In the end we had all our food comped, and asked to come back this friday on the hostess manager. I tend not to even come to this one as there tends to be a lot of kids/teenagers doing what",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=60,1.84,1.84,1.84,1.7320000000000002,1.8400000000000003
18,Jeanna M.,"Washington, DC",5,40,93.0,2.0,2015-03-22,"My two cousins & I decided to hang out at this specific TGI Fridays simply for it's convenient location.  There was a 15 wait for seating in the bar area & a 40 minute wait for dining area. Take a guess at which one we chose. Once seated it was 6 minutes before the waiter arrived. We decided on the Endless Apps Special & ordered some drinks. Within 4 minutes a bartender( I think) came to our table to explain to me that by ordering a frozen margarita the alcohol would be thinned out. This woman went back & fourth with me until I switched my drink, I chose a double berry mojito. What I don't get is why provide the customer with the option of a  frozen or regular margarita if you can't or won't accommodate the proper alcohol measurements for the drink smh. The drinks took 10 minutes & the food took 15 minutes. We were never given any napkins or straws until requested. Once the drinks finally arrived, mine & my cousin's were mixed up. One of the drinks had waaay too much use of alcohol & was not properly garnished. When the check finally arrived we had to remind them to take of the two drinks that they ruined off smh.

As we were getting our food someone broke a glass. The glass stayed on the floor with four plus servers passing out food for 20-30 minutes. My mother being a server pulled Tyreek to the side and spoke with him letting him know that alot of ppl are done with their food and he should pre bus and pick up the glass. He picked it up with one hand and passed food with the other. You all may want to consider a safety training. They then got the so called manager Tony involved. He brushed it off and said he would see about doing something about the check. (Nothing major)  Once it was time to get the check that was going to be split Tyreek split the bill for us and never gave us a total bill. Now at this point ppl are giving cash left and right and leaving out the door. My mother and myself were the last to pay the bill. Once I was about to leave Tyreek told me that two entrees weren't paid for. My cousin went in because now the cops are at our vechiles. He ended up paying 141. Thats a big jump from two entrees. Plus a 20 tip. The cop said well the servers do mess up a lot here can you have everyone come back. So now ppl are coming back to tell them they paid. Tyreek was unsure about who paid what. He was very unorginazed. Tony had an attitude the entire time and very short with us. He didn't want to speak to any of the ladies. Only wanted to speak to my male cousin. Thats not cool. While all this is going on a 5 inch spider falls from the celling at another party and they kill it with a menu. Tony doesnt have ppl skills and you may want to reconsider his position there. I work for the Clydes Restaurant Group and we would never treat guess like that ask them to come back show receipts and only give 37 back out of 141. Thats what bad debt is for. The fact that they gave 37 lets you know Tyreek doesn't know who paid what. We had children yet glass is still on the floor. I live in Hyattsville and its well after midnight and I am just now getting my one year old in the house. This isn't the first BAD experience  here but this one takes the cake.

There was another man pouring wine with another guy on the other side of the bar, I said ""excuse me sir"" like 4 times before he finally turned around to say ""I hear you ma'am I'll be with you in a minute"". I told him it was an emergency I needed water my husband had food go down the wrong way. He then grabbed a glass and ran water from the sink.  We never heard back from the the waiter we asked for water or our waitress,until she was ready to bring the check.  I will have to say through this bad experience the food I got was good, but that's too bad because no matter how good the food is I should be valued as a customer and given quality service.

No one wants to be there, clearly by their disgusting attitudes when speaking to customers. Next issue was that we happened to be sitting at a table underneath the leaky ceilings. When brought to the manager's attention, his suggestion was that we scoot our table more to the left and a wet floor sign. The hell? After having water dripping on our table and items for a period of time, and multiple complaints, we were moved to the corner of the back of the restaurant. We got here at 4:35, and the children's food came out at 5:30. The adults' food came out 20 mins later with the exception of one person (who had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the wrong order). The waiter named Javon, for whatever reason had an atrocious attitude from the beginning, decided since we inconvenienced him by moving from the best seats in the house, he would no longer serve us or check on us. Finally, we had to chase down the manager to give us the incorrect check. Everything about this place was awful and I feel like this was a glimpse of how dining in hell would be.

Mimi took her sweet fucking time getting the sauce for my wings. Even stopping to have a conversation with one of her coworkers after I asked for it. The side conversations she was having was obviously more important than bringing me what I asked for so I could enjoy my food. I also ordered the Long Island iced tea which they had a special on. However, that HARDLY had any liquor in it. All that would've been fine though had Mimi been coming back to our table to ask how the food and drinks were once she brought everything out.

Before you ask, I knew this was Friday's so my expectations were minimal. It STILL disappointed. Hugely. The server, while sweet, was so uninformed about the menu that we basically had to walk HER thru it, pointing at pictures so she'd understand what we wanted.  The wine I ordered (and NEEDED by the time our food arrived) was not what I got. It took 20 minutes for that to be rectified. TWENTY MINUTES. By the time I got my drink, my wife (who I insisted start without me) was halfway done with hers. In fact, she actually had to get up and seek out the server twice to find out where the food and wine were.  I asked if they had tartar sauce 3x and each time was told 'we have cocktail sauce'. I now assume that meant no but at the time I honestly questioned whether she'd heard or understood me. Not exaggerating.  My broccoli was cold. Not room temp. ICE COLD. It took another 20 minutes for them to bring out the sweet potato fries i requested instead (bc I now had zero faith in their respect for vegetables). How do FRIES take 20 mins? If you're doing the math, by the time they arrived, our entire meal was done. W IN THE ENTIRE EFF!? And the most annoying part was that although our server was apologetic, she displayed ZERO urgency.

1,Fidelia K.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,4,,1.0,2017-01-19,"I have been to other TGIFridays and never had a complaint but I'm warning anyone who's thinking about eating at this location, find another one because you may be extremely disappointed and truthfully if I had read these reviews I would've gone to another restaurant. My friend and I walked in almost 8pm on the dot!  We'll start w/the waitress who introduced herself as ""Diva"" ok yes! To me that name is synonymous with ""I'm in charge""!  I should've known that wouldn't be the case when I asked her about my favorite appetizer, spinach bruschetta which I couldn't recall the name at the time but when I described it to her as ""spinach on flatbread"" you would think she had a clue. Nope I had to look at the menu because all she kept coming up with was the spinach dip! She went to put in for my appetizer and gave us time to look at the menu.  I'm a vegetarian which I pointed out that I don't eat meat or fish and was actually hoping they'd have some options now because they need to cater to the vegetarian trend!  Of course the only suggestion she had was the veggie bean burger which has NO taste as far as I'm concerned.  I looked on the menu and was pleasantly surprised that it included  a new veggie addition or so I thought,  referred to as the ""Mediterranean Mahi Naan"" described on menu as ""grilled mahi mahi drizzled w/balsamic glaze on naan bread w/cucumber yogurt sauce, balsamic-glazed onions, garlic, basil & roma tomato bruschetta and mixed greens w/kale"".  Mind you I had no idea what ""mahi mahi"" was until later I found out that it's fish but asked miss ""diva"" specifically if there's any meat & her response was ""it's all vegetables"".  We got our drinks and waited for my appetizer.  30 mins later our meals were on the table and when I asked miss so-called diva where my appetizer was she responded ""they haven't brought that out yet...i'm sorry...you ordered what again...?"" I told her the only reason I'm even there was mainly to get the spinach bruschetta.  Another 15 minutes passed as she returned to find out if I had my appetizer. Needless to say it was almost an hour before it finally arrived w/the Manager who apologized profusely & at that time attempted to resolve that mishap by telling us the appetizer was on the house. Apart from my friend enjoying his turkey burger I had lost my appetite at that point and decided to take my course ""to go"".  This diva brought us our check and muttered something about our bill being ""half price""  and left to take care of another patron but I'm thinking the entire bill was half-price, come to find out she was really saying that the appetizer was half-price.  In other words she took it upon herself to give us that so-called discount as opposed to asking what the manager had decided.  My friend was so disgusted he left the restaurant and asked me to handle it. I directed ms diva to talk to the manager as he's the one who decided to exclude the appetizer from the bill due to their incompetency.  She again apologized for her mistake and told me she'll remove the $5.00 discrepancy.  I also was fed up at that point and knew that it wouldn't make or break my friend's pocket because it was frustrating and I wasn't going to spend another minute in that pathetic establishment.  Do not waste your time and money at this TGIFridays.  At least you were forewarned!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=40,1.88,1.88,1.88,1.3800000000000003,1.88

Not only was there a sour smell lingering in the air around the bar, but we were told our waitress was new and would not be ready to service us for 10-15 minutes. We waited because we were hungry and excited about trying the new promo: $10 endless appetizers. Cheap food, doesn't have to mean low service expectations. Our waitress was sweet, at first, using a tablet to take down our order. But quickly began dropping the ball by not bringing us silverware, which we still didn't have by the END of our meal. Really disappointing. We spent most of our 2+ hour meal waiting for food (you'd think we'd have been able to at least get our appetizers replenished ONCE within a 45 minutes, but no) and repeating our request for utensils, napkins, side sauces, and refills on water.  Aside from her scratching her braids at the table, which I managed (somehow) to overlook, our waitress had very little follow through. While waiting for our second set of appetizers (45 min), she must've stopped by our table at least 4-5 times to tell us our food should be ready. I watched as surrounding tables were serviced (though also just as slowly and sporadically), and we couldn't even get refills on water or napkins to wipe our hands after the first set of food we'd eaten.  Talking to the manager proved to be even more of a waste of time as we explained that we'd been waiting for the essentials: water, utensils, and napkins. And he just looked at us as if he couldn't care less. As if we were an inconvenience or wasting his time. Not to mention when he came, he'd only brought 2 out of 3 of ordered dishes. Another manager had to be roped in to get us our checks and 3rd dish (this was all only a second order of appetizers).

In the mist of us waiting for our bill our waitress quit/ got fired and he began to chase her out the door where they got into an altercation. It was the worse experience ever and I'm shocked that he didn't apologize for my horrible experience. My husband never received his food and we paid full price for the bill????",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=20,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
34,Stephanie J.,"Forestville, MD",86,24,28.0,2.0,2017-07-24,If you've been to one TGI Friday's you've been to them all.  Service wise one may be better than the other.  Some coworkers of mine and I met up at this particular Friday's we always sit on the bar side of course.  Our service was just okay our server was new and only been there for a week so we cut her some slack. At the end onnnf the day she did her best for just started out.  Food came out in good timing. Parking at this location is terrible but its surrounding parking I usually have to park in the grocery store parking lot next door.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
23,Sarah V.,"Arlington, VA",134,314,757.0,1.0,2017-07-25,"Horrendous service. Go to another TGIF. It took forever to get out endless apps and once it did come out it was with our food. To get to-go boxes, I had to go get up and get it myself. The check was wrong and then it took forever for the correction and to pay it. Worse service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

27,Angela J.,"Capitol Heights, MD",10,7,53.0,2.0,2017-08-03,My neighborhood Friday with key word being (Hood). The Music was extremely loud on lounge side. Only the Bar area is suppose to have loud music. I Couldn't have a conversation with my family because the music was so loud. I could not tell if it was a restaurant or Club. The Food was mediocre and drinks was okay.  I definitely will be sending a official email to corporate about professionalism and customer service at this establishment. In general if you want a okay service food and drink come to the Fridays in District Heights Maryland!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
35,AJ V.,"Washington, DC",0,7,4.0,1.0,2017-08-14,"So I ordered the Endless Appetizer: Boneless JD wings. It came out Luke warm and ended because I have been waiting for a refill.

22,Jasmine R.,"Washington, DC",9,13,,1.0,2017-08-22,"I just.... can't. Came on a Tuesday night, the turn up in the bar was real (so much for late happy hour). Matter fact, the music is dope and you can hear it from the dining area.  My SALAD took 45 minutes. We ordered 2 appetizers, only got ONE (she def forgot altogether, bc it wasn't on the check). My mai tai took 10 minutes. The silverware was dirty.  How dirty, you ask? I ate the first few bites with my fingers because it had what may have been old brownie residue, and I had to ask 2 diff servers to bring me a replacement.  The server was nice but that's all I can say about that. Maybe she was too busy? But honestly I just came to eat, not sympathize (let's be honest). She never came to refill water until we were basically done, and we got half a to-go box bc she kept walking past without bringing the top.  Salmon was well cooked but it took so long, I was chewing my fingers by the time it came.  Overall: Service sucks Atmosphere turnt (even on a Tuesday) Skip this altogether if you're hungry- just go to Wendy's (otherwise you will wish you had)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
21,Albani C.,"Oxon Hill, MD",0,27,4.0,1.0,2017-09-18,"Avoid if you can. The customer service is so subpar.  The only saving grace are the happy hour drink specials, but those same specials can be found at other locations, so go to the others. If, for some sad reason you must come to this location, be prepared for slow service, cold appetizers, and a nail clipping in your beverage.  In particular, the server to avoid is Kalitia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
31,Van R.,"Washington, DC",1,3,8.0,1.0,2017-09-22,If I could give this Friday's a zero star I would. Doesn't make sense that a well known establishment is this ghetto. We waiting like 25 mins for someone to come take our order. No one greets you at the door. Everyone is on there own accord when it comes to customer service. I will not be coming back. I don't recommend this Friday's to anyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
29,Alexis S.,"District Heights, MD",20,12,2.0,3.0,2017-10-20,"Staff and attitude has gotten way better here. Been here a few times after the review and they have grown. However, management has not. We reserved online for a party of 10 of course, something wasn't right. We arrived just for management to tell us they aren't affiliated with online reservations and that we would have to wait 1 hour.  Then he just walked away. Literally we were puzzled like nothing for our troubles? But that staff that night got us out the way. But some tables together for us and served us great. Our drinks took 45 minutes to come but we still got our food and had a great time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001

We sat at a table in the bar area without being greeted from any of the servers working. We spoke to two different servers asking who would be waiting on us, and after being reassured that they would get them no one showed up. We waited for 30mins at this location and then left and went to the Applebees around the corner and was greeted within minutes.
