24,Reena D.,"Euless, TX",516,808,939.0,4.0,2013-07-26,"This is a really nice Chili's!  The ambience is really nice and modern.  The El Nino margarita is really good.  We usually swap out the GranGala for Grand Marnier.  The skillet queso is still fantastic.  The chipotle chicken flatbread is pretty good.  I do enjoy the nachos here.  If you want something to eat on the healthier side, the Mango-Chile Tilapia and Margarita Grilled Chicken are really good.  Service here is always a hit or miss.  Our last time here, we never saw our waitress after getting our food.  We had to flag someone else down which was really annoying.  There are plenty of parking spots here.

NOPE. lol maybe they should reconsider. anywho it took about 15min to get a table for 12. but we had to sit in 2 different booths, which made no sense because we saw a long table ready for 12 it just wasnt clean. they need to get it together. but i digress i was just being nice i guess. our server did the best she could for us and thats all i can say lol. she was very nice and kept refills she deserved many tips and we accommodated. food took forever to come out and the restaurant was maybe half full. im not sure if ill come back here.  very nice bathrooms everythings clean. be careful though i got a splinter from the booths as they are partially wood. no bueno. anywho the food over all was good price is the same and portions are good and consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford?start=20,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007

The first time it had just opened, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt when lunch took an hour and a half, and then my 2 out of the 3 orders at my table were wrong. I just went again, and this time dinner took an hour and a half, my appetizer never showed up, and the service was even worse (if that's even possible) . We sat at the table for 10 minutes with it dirty(because they asked us too) while other tables that sat after us were cleaned. Then I ordered ordered my food, and tables that sat after us got the same appetizer before us(the one that never showed up).

TONS of dirty drink glasses and plates with napkins I asked the short brown hair bartender if these were done and she said ""yeah no ones there"" and went back to her customers and didn't even acknowledge me (as a single patron at the time) I never got offered a drink, nothing... I asked the man behind the bar for a drink; ""oh I'm not a bartender.. I can't serve drinks"" yet he asked the bartender ""hey she wants a blue moon is it cool if I serve her one?"" The bartender nodded. SOMEONE NOT ALLOWED to serve, served me. Once my friends arrived and drinks started being ordered the bartender was MUCH more attentive. Also? The glasses aren't clean bc the other bartender w/ blond hair made sure to tell the ""bar back"" ... ""Let's make sure these glasses are clean before serving (looking at the dirty glass)."" And she served it to the patron. AFTER THAT? why go back? Do not come here for good service. People were asking the ""bar back"" for help on their checks and to deliver their checks and he can't be he's LEGALLY not allowed-- yet did. This place is unorganized and when speaking to the manager He had nothing to do or say but DEFEND his unlawful employees. I've been in the business... Don't come to this place for good service (unless you want soggy cheese fries)!

35,Valerie W.,"Bedford, TX",69,16,,1.0,2015-07-16,"I mean, it's a chain restaurant, so you SHOULD know what you're getting when you're going, and not expect fine dining - but the only consistency here is crap service and worse food. I've been a few times now and after last night, never again. We thought with the change in management, the issues would improve but we were wrong. To highlight specifics from last night's visit, the chicken fajita meat wasn't cooked fully or was just taken from frozen to microwave because it was rubbery and gross. Also, we asked the waiter if we could have our spinach queso without pico de gallo and cilantro - it came out with pico and cilantro but no guac; he then argued with me and said it wasn't cilantro, it was spinach - took it back, scraped off the pico/cilantro and added a scoop of sad, grey-green guac, thereby losing our queso fresco and the bubbly cheese on top ... awesome! In the past, we've walked out due to poor service, returned months' later to similarly bad service (nothing like ordering chicken and getting fish!) and my husband has promised never, ever, ever again to talk me into going to this location just because it's closer.

But we waited a long time for our burgers. The waitress didn't update us on where our food was. Finally she told us the burgers were ready but the fries weren't and asked if we wanted burgers and fries to come out together or did we want to eat the burgers now. We chose to have all parts of our meal at once. Finally the food came out. The  bun as very hard and the meat was dried out. I requested new lettuce since my lettuce was black and wilted because  it had sat under the heat lamp. I tried to put ranch on the burger to soften the bun. It was the worst burger from Chili's I've ever had. I mentioned it to the waitress. She didn't seem very concerned and just said I could talk to  the manager. After a few  minutes, a woman walked to my table and just said "" did you want to talk to me?"" No introductions, nothing. I told  her about the burger and she offered to take some off my bill.

26,Lynda K.,"Hurst, TX",29,5,8.0,2.0,2016-05-28,"First time we visited this location, my husband and I ordered the 2 for $20. On the menu it states that you will received 2 FULL entrees, this was not the case. I ordered the ancho sirloin that, according to the menu, was a FULL entree and should have come with fries. I received the steak, a couple of hard asparagus stalks and tomatoes. When I inquired about the fries I was told the 2 for $20 doesn't come w/ fries. What? The menu stated it did. Well, I didn't argue about it, I just went home an emailed Chili's to inquire about it. They responded stating their website AND their menus were incorrect in stating that they were FULL entrees, so why not change the website and menus to reflect the correct information?? But they did send $20 in gift certificates, which I appreciate. So, tonight we went back to the Bedford location. My children ordered the enchilada plates and I ordered the Guac Burger. My kids plates came out filthy looking and my plate had a glob of something on it and something red smeared on the corner. When I asked the mngr if the plates normally look that filthy he told me that ""it's splatter from the enchiladas going through the oven, but my plate shouldn't look dirty."" He did nothing about my dirty plate, just said thank you and walked off. And I can understand that an enchilada plate would splatter going through an oven, but why serve it dirty?? I mean it looked like the plates hadn't been washed all day. Presentation is everything, especially when serving food. Anyway, the waitress (Zaira) was friendly and as attentive as she could be w/ the amount of people that were there. The mgr was also friendly, but disappointed that he didn't attempted to do anything about my dirty plate that ""Wasn't supposed to be dirty"".  I can say for certainty that will won't be back to this location.

Our drink orders coming out were slow, I didn't understand because there was literally no one there. When my steak came out it was well done instead of medium, like very well done and I didn't understand what everyone was doing. I felt like since no one was there they really just didn't care about who was. In the meantime I had finished my drink and waited and waited and waited for another one. And we were sitting at the bar!! Eventually she did come back to give me my medium steak, i ordered a second drink finally but my sides were cold. It was disappointing as far as a customer experience goes but then it just got awkward. The bartender came up and apologized for the steak and then started telling me all about how she won't get hours if I give her a bad review. She then told me how other people have gotten fired bc of customer reviews on their automatic machine and begged me to give her 5 stars anyway. She continued to tell me how crooked the establishment was to the staff while I'm trying to eat my cold meal and it was overall a very awkward experience. All I wanted was some steak but instead I got a cold, overdone meal and unnecessary drama.

12,Ally D.,"Bedford, TX",11,59,4.0,2.0,2016-11-18,"My son HAD to go to Chili's for his birthday because he loves their kids pizza. I am not a giant Chili's fan (unless it's for happy hour alcohol) because the food is pretty basic but hey, it wasn't my day -- it was his. So on to Chili's we went! He was so excited that it was his 6th birthday and we told him to tell the waiter that it was his birthday. When our somewhat grumpy waiter came over to get our drink order, my son told him (very excitedly) that it was his birthday. Our waiter didn't even flinch and left to get our drinks. We thought maybe he didn't hear him so we're like okay tell him again... The waiter came back to take our order and our son said it again and the waiter replied ""OKAY BUDDY!"" but not in a happy tone, in a ""I heard you the first time, stop talking"" tone. This completely rubbed me the wrong way since this was his special birthday dinner.  We got the cheese curds as an appetizer and they were almost too salty to eat (was somewhat excited to try something new on the menu). The rest of our food was meh, typical Chili's food to me, nothing special. The kid loved his pizza though (he always does). At the end of the meal, the waiter whispered to us about my son's birthday ice cream (which we had to ask about when he asked about desserts) and came back with his ice cream a few minutes later -- which he handed to me while I was eating and then promptly left. No ""happy birthday"" or anything from this guy. How hard is it to tell this obviously excited 6 year old happy birthday when he told you the first time it was his birthday or when you got his birthday dessert?

29,Christian B.,"Bedford, TX",7,2,,1.0,2017-01-29,"This is my first review but I was just that disappointed. I've been to other locations before but wanted to give this one a try since my wife and I just moved here. Absolutely terrible. We came in on a Friday night around 4 pm. We walked in and stood there for at least 10 minutes and nobody came to even say hi and seat us. We watched as all the other staff saw us and made no effort to help or say hi. So I had to walk over and ask if we could get seated, finally we did. We were sat down right beside a manager that was interviewing someone. 15 minutes pass as my wife and I sit  there and nobody had come over yet. So yet again I had to walk up and ask if we could get some service. She comes over and we ask for the queso. She tells us they are out and don't have anymore. At that point I felt my money was best spent elsewhere. As we get up to leave the manager turns and sees us, asks us what happened so I tell him. He apologizes and asks if we want a different server. I tell him no and leave. Why would I want a different one when they all ignored me",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
13,Peggy S.,"Arlington, TX",178,9,,4.0,2017-03-12,"Chili's makes an effort to make eating and getting out in a timely manner pretty streamlined. The computer screen on the table allows you to order appetizers, etc. at the table as well as conveniently pay without having to wait.  We love Chelsea and request her when we eat here! She has our orders memorized and we know 100% she will not get any of it wrong!  The ancho salmon is one of the heart-healthiest items on the menu, in my opinion so that is my standing order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
10,Mary N.,"Los Alamitos, CA",475,1627,1021.0,2.0,2017-03-30,They have a large menu so there is a lot of variety in their options.  We were seated quickly and our drink order were also quickly taken.  Overall the food wasn't all that memorable. I probably wouldn't eat here again aside from when trying to accommodate a large group with different preferences.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
22,John P.,"Garland, TX",3,7,,2.0,2017-04-01,"Went here with my girlfriend, her sister,  and brother-in-law. We first were going to sit in the bar, but all the tables that weren't occupied were dirty. There  were two bartenders, not many customers,  so we couldn't understand why they were dirty. So, we got a table in the main dining area, but things didn't get any better. After being seated, the manager came by and took our drink order, and then the drinks sat at the bar for over five minutes. When I had drank my beer, I sat the empty glass on the end of our table, as a signal. For over ten minutes employees walked by, including our waiter and a mananger. I finally had to stop an employee and ask for a fresh beer. Our food came, and the French fries tasted like they had been waiting for a while, and we're cold. People who were seated after us, got their food and left long before we even got our food. Needless to say we did not have a pleasant experience at this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
18,Matthew P.,"Keller, TX",0,65,15.0,5.0,2017-04-09,This is my go to place for drinks and consistent food. The Service can be so so. But i come for the drinks and the food. I always sit at the bar so there is no screaming kids and able to watch a game. It's nice that it's no smoking. I have never sent food back and keep myself wanting more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
3,Kendall S.,"Fort Worth, TX",3068,762,1332.0,3.0,2017-04-17,"There are 2 things about Chilis that I will always enjoy, no matter how many years pass: their chips and salsa. They're consistently perfect! The chips are thin and crispy and just greasy enough and super salty. They never taste like old oil! And even though the salsa is sort of plain and watery, it's delicious and cold and fresh. I could never go to Chili's and not order the chips and salsa -- that would be nuts! The steaks aren't bad and I think the burgers are really good! Fun, basic drink specials and really affordable prices overall. It's a comfortable and casual place to just lounge at the bar for happy hour, enjoying an inexpensive snack and cocktail. Of course they have an enormous menu with something for every general palate: appetizers galore, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, fajitas, wings, seafood, tacos, pasta, chicken nuggets...  It's clean and service is quick. I find the staff to be pretty upbeat and sunny for a chain. Pleasant overall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
17,David H.,"Fort Worth, TX",31,6,,1.0,2017-04-19,This Chilis has a unique policy on charging for doubles that no other Chilis does.  I dont recommend coming here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
19,Tyler B.,"Dallas, TX",174,6,1.0,2.0,2017-04-22,Honestly two is a stretch. I am only giving them two because they are relatively new. We came on at a time with not many other customers still had very slooooww service and the food was alright. Thirty minutes for drinks after it took ten minutes to get a chance to order them. Then finally get our food after an hour and a half of being there. They do deserve a one star but I'll stay with two do to being newer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

9,Nick N.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,10,8.0,2.0,2017-05-26,"Pros: the waiter was extremely nice and helpful  The menu choices varies so people have many options It's a great place for kids and family  Cons: the food was beyond average, plain and cold Extremely noisy for anyone company for two  Weirdly pricey 2 for 22; it's much 2 for 30 with tip and drinks.  Overall: probably won't comeback, can find way better food for 30 dollars, more like worth like 10 dollars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
23,Jana B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,,2.0,2017-06-11,"Went here last week (Friday, June 2nd) for a drink and appetizer. Probably the least exhilarating experience I've ever had at a Chili's. The entire staff seemed out of sorts all night. Cocktail was made very poorly (tasted like water and was a very light tan color when it was supposed to be whiskey), several different wait staff took an order vs serving food vs drink order vs serving a drink. I witnessed a lot of horse play back in the kitchen as well as the bartender stuffing food in her mouth (I was sat at a booth in the bar area that looked into the kitchen). The food quality was below average. The chicken tenders were like biting into rubber and the dipping sauce tasted like chemicals. Several tables were left dirty and not bussed. The was my first and last time to go to this Chili's location. Management definitely needs to tend to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford?start=20,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
7,Katie D.,"Killeen, TX",29,57,40.0,3.0,2017-06-28,"Extremely friendly service. The effort was probably the sweetest person I've encountered this month. My daughter loved her food, but it's tally easy to get s cheese pizza and fries right. I got the Chipotle crispy chicken and waffles out something of that version. The chicken was perfectly acceptable. A little sweety for my taste. The waffles tasted like they were made with cake batter. It even crumbled like cake in places. I ate most of the chicken strips bit could only finish one of the waffles. I have a huge sweet tooth but I was not expecting that level out of waffles. Anyway, the fries were okay and the floors are perpetually slippery. It was an okay visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

1,Amanda Y.,"Burleson, TX",51,16,8.0,2.0,2017-09-03,Yesterday I went with a group of 11 people. Our waitress was doing great. So here are the issues ny niece had hair in her salad. The manager came by and said the salad person had blonde hair and she would remake the salad.  Then we got our food. Again my niece and her bf had steaks not made the way they asked. They wanted over 10 mins for new ones. When it was time to pay we noticed that my niece was still charged for her food. We literally had to ask for a manager. She said she would take care pf the food for them. We again waited 20 min when we had to ask for her again she said she got distracted but we saw her up at the front not doing anything. After all that my niece bf still paid for his food because qe were sick of it. Lets just say this was not a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

The long-haired hostess said 15-20 minutes. 3-party group came in next, then other groups. I asked the hostess if she needs give us a number or at least take down our names. She said ""No"" with an attitude. I took that she has an awesome memory; she could remember the order of people coming enough. Then she sat the 3-party group. We still waited and waited. Some groups left. Then, one customer came up; saying they have been waiting for their order for a long time. At that point, we were done and left.

11,Shawna E.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-01,"This is the worst chili's I've ever been to. There were 7 of us...4 adults and 3 teenagers. By the time we were done eating and paying it had been almost 3 hours. We had to send both queso's back because they were cold, 3 of us had steamed broccoli with our meals but all those had to be sent back because they too were seasonless and cold. Not to mention both baskets of chips they brought us for our queso were nothing but salt and crumbs. Our server was never around...and when she did come she would always forget what we asked her for. Avoid this place...cheddars is right across the street. It's cheaper and has much better service...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bedford,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
