17,Paul R.,"Brown Township, OH",156,308,9.0,3.0,2015-12-10,"I don't venture to Tuttle Mall too often anymore, but I was there Christmas shopping. We were hungry walking in, and Red Robin struck our fancy. Like I said, I haven't been to the mall in awhile, so I don't know how long Red Robin has been there, but I got the impression it's fairly new. The restaurant was packed during this Thursday holiday season lunch crowd. We were promptly seated and then greeted by our waitress. She took our drink orders and had them out in a reasonable time. I ordered a chicken tender salad with French dressing. My wife ordered the bbq chicken bacon sandwich, and requested the mayo be held. Approximately 12 minutes later, the waitress returned and informed me they didn't have French dressing and asked if I'd like another option. If I'd have known they didn't have French dressing, I would've probably not ordered a salad! I didn't have time to order something else, so I said bleu cheese dressing which I'm not a huge fan of. ****Bonus star added. Red Robin acknowledged my review and is very concerned. They are going out of their way to make it right. Bravo! After a very long wait of over half an hour for our salad and burger, our food came. The wife's sandwich came with mayo, but was missing the bacon! When the manager made her rounds, we informed her of the mistake. She was nice enough to take the sandwich off the bill. Unfortunately, we again didn't have another half an hour to wait for another sandwich. I might try this restaurant out in the future if it is recently opened to see if they can iron out the kinks. But if I find out they have been there for awhile, I'll definitely explore the many other food options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
19,Daniel C.,"Hilliard, OH",52,26,2.0,1.0,2016-02-06,Me and my friends sat down and ordered our drinks and food and put the apatitizer in through the computer on the table the appitizer came in no less than 5 minutes but our drinks took 30mins and the food still wasn't out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
13,Cindy G.,"New Paris, OH",58,30,136.0,2.0,2016-03-16,"So we have been here 5 times. We are faithful customers of Polaris RR. We have tried this location 5 times too many. This location is closer to our home so we hoped it would work. EACH time they not only mess up our food but the tables around us. The kitchen does not have it together nor do many of the servers.  Tonight we got our meal 45 minutes after ordering. It was incorrect in 8 ways. Our server never came back during the wait for our food, I had to go to the bar for refills. They brought one fry for our family of four.  It took 2 different people and 4 trips to the kitchen to fix our order. No apologies given, just an attitude of annoyance. Time to head back to Polaris. So if you want top quality for service and food, head to the RR at Polaris. **RR customer service has reached out to me here and on Twitter. Hoping they can work to correct the constant mistakes at this restaurant.  Will keep you updated. **",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
9,Josh S.,"Columbus, OH",30,31,113.0,4.0,2016-03-31,"Red Robin has become one of my favorite burger spots. The flavor beats Five Guys and all the other burger chains. The meat taste fresh and juicy, the lettuce and tomatoes are crispy.  The sweet potato fries are great, the normal fires are great with the garlic butter on the side  The wait time for two people is not bad, around 10-15 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
18,Jenny M.,"Garfield Heights, OH",10,18,,1.0,2016-04-18,"Red Robin has a decent quality burger and chicken menu.  Kids like it, so on occasion we will stop in.   We will never go to the Tuttle location again.   We stopped in Saturday evening around 8- crowds were gone, no waiting.   The worst service I've ever experienced.  A waiter that couldn't bother to serve us. We couldn't even get silverware, and upon requesting multiple times, still only received 3 napkins - we are a party of 4.    My husbands sandwich was served with an onion peel rather than onions, and we alerted the manager, and his response?  Well the kitchen gets busy and they cut up those onions fast.   Not even an apology - just excuses.   Then the wait staff who couldn't be bothered to even check in complained loudly about previous guests.   This service was so poor it was laughable.     Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
3,Bethany K.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",90,323,249.0,4.0,2016-04-25,"I have been here three times over the past 6ish months, and it wasn't just out of convenience. I love that they offer bottomless French fries, however I rarely get the benefit of that due to my meal being SO filling! This last visit I ordered the Ramen Burger -- I have been told it's a hit or miss with customers... It was a BIG hit with me! The buns consist of fried ramen noodles with being dressed with an Asian style slaw.... It would definitely order again! I have had other meals which have all been solid, but the ramen burger was the most memorable. I highly recommend the speckled (freckeled) lemondade!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
20,Finbarr C.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,2.0,2016-06-25,"Service? Not terrible. Food? On point. Atmosphere?....appalling. I wasn't sure if I was at an eating establishment or a ChuckECheese. Lego ""sculptures"" in the middle of the room, an exposed buffalo framed on the CEILING. Unbelievable. Beer bottles hanging from wire attempting to be art. Sloppy chalk boards that drunk morons can scribble on. Speaking of drinks, I turned my head to watch in awe as the waitress set a cocktail glass down wondering if I was in an episode of Jimmy Neutron, swivel hair and all. I won't be back until they remodel again, I'll tell you that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin?start=20,,,,,
16,Megan P.,"Massillon, OH",53,18,1.0,1.0,2016-09-09,"Walking in on a Friday night about 9pm...no hostess in site. We waited about three minutes and she appeared, took us a to a booth but we asked to be sat somewhere else as the lighting was blindingly bright over the booths. She took us to a table, but, sorta walked past it, touched it and walked away. So since we were between tables, we sat at one. She came back through and told us no, to sit at the other. OKAYYY. Our server came right out, brought silverware (though enough for three people, it was just my husband and I), and took our drink order. She brought our water out, asked if we were ready to order. We ordered an appetizer (fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks). She brought it out with marinara and sweet chili Thai sauce. It was an odd combination, so we asked for ranch- MUCH better flavors.  We ordered our food- I ordered a classic fried chicken sandwich and a milkshake; my husband ordered the All American Patty Melt with a side of BBQ sauce. I asked for an side of mayo as sometimes they don't put enough sauce to my liking...the waitress said, ""for what?"" I let her know, my sandwich comes with mayo, I like extra on the side. Our food came out before we were finished with our appetizer. Problems arise...my chicken fell out of the breaking in one fellow bite. I've worked in fast food before, I recognize this as letting frozen, fried chicken breasts sit in a food warmer for entirely too long. UNACCEPTABLE. My husbands ""patty melt"" had more smothered onions and Thousand Island than anything and...was missing CHEESE!! He said it tasted like frozen meat. I also haven't received my milkshake yet. We alerted our server who just had excuse after excuse as to why the milkshake wasn't ordered and asked me if I was sure I didn't want it. We asked for the manager, he took one look at my chicken and said it was unacceptable to have been served that. When my husband brought up that his burger tasted like a frozen patty, he said that nothing is frozen in their restaurant. Ha, okay bud. He did take off our entrees and had us just pay for our mediocre appetizer.  We aren't from this area, but heard this was a new restaurant in the area (we have them where we are from and enjoy eating there MOST of the time). The floors were DISGUSTING...paper, food, crumbs were everywhere. And not just from a table or two- the whole dining area we were in was like that. The hostess was busy chatting it up with coworkers and the servers weren't on the floor and no one was cleaning. When we left, the hostess, a few servers and the manager were hanging out at the door. They apologized for our bad meal again and we said goodbye. I would not recommend this Red Robin and I will never return to this location, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
15,Amy W.,"Columbus, OH",100,13,1.0,5.0,2016-10-21,"I've always had a really lovely experience here with both the food and the staff! It's a laid back, non pushy environment with delicious options for everyone, no matter your eating lifestyle! Great location at the mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
5,Kevin L.,"Columbus, OH",47,27,7.0,1.0,2017-01-22,After about a week of speaking with both corporate Red Robin and the owner I was given a $15 gift card for my trouble. As if I would ever want to go back to that place again. I'm honestly afraid to even eat or drink outside of my house after this experience least of all ever going back there again. I don't even want to go to the mall Not only was their handling of this situation completely impersonal but $15 is not even close to the $60 I spent to be poisoned. Very disappointed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
14,Christopher E.,"Columbus, OH",0,5,2.0,4.0,2017-01-24,"I hadn't been to a Red Robin in years and was really expecting a sub-par casual dining experience but I was pleasantly surprised how nice this place was! Aside from a really unimpressive draft beer selection, the food was great with interesting and unique burger varieties, to die for fried pickles, and an attentive and friendly serving staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
12,Drue G.,"Pickerington, OH",44,93,111.0,4.0,2017-02-19,I love Red Robin every time I go. Always  the same good burgers cooked right and some of the best fries in the business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
10,Matthew M.,"Hilliard, OH",3,33,,5.0,2017-03-05,"Had lunch there on a Saturday. Suzanne was our waitress. She was down right slammed with tables. Though she was being run ragged, she still was polite and provided spot on service. It was nice to actually have a polite waitress for a change. This location is much nicer and has much better food than the Hilliard location. We will return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,

2,Ryan G.,"Hilliard, OH",41,49,73.0,4.0,2017-04-22,"This is a busy place, but for the right reasons. Apps are amazing waitresses are friendly and helpful. The burgers are always amazing. A1 Peppercorn is a more expensive one but the flavor is off the chart. End of the day, yes it's your standard chain restaurant. But it's got alot of great options even if a burger doesn't sound good to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
6,Rebecca M.,"Monaca, PA",0,10,4.0,2.0,2017-04-29,"The positive: large restaurant right in the Tuttle Crossing mall. Decor is very cool, and restaurant was clean. Food was delivered piping hot.  The negative: service was exceptionally slow. Our server left a lot to be desired. It took her over 5 minutes to greet us and take our drink and appetizer order. Drinks came, and we were all ready to order, and indicated that to her. She just smiled  and walked away. Appetizer was delivered and still no order was taken. We had to wait an additional 5 minutes to eat our appetizer because she never even brought us napkins or silverware. We had to flag down a different server and ask her to get our server so we could get utensils.  When she finally brought them she took our food order.  Then we waited...and waited.... and waited.... 45 minutes before our food arrived. The restaurant wasn't all that busy. Other tables that arrived after us actually finished eating before we even got our food! We ate very fast as we had to be somewhere at a certain time. Paid our bill via the ziosk. She came to clear our plates and we asked for a to go box. We waited another 10 minutes for her to bring a to go box. We wound up being late for our activity due to slow service. Advice: go there if you want got food and have a few hours to kill waiting for slow service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
8,Yasser A.,"Columbus, OH",9,34,20.0,4.0,2017-04-30,"Well known for it's burger. But try the fish sandwich or the crispy chicken , you won't regret it! Also you can substitute the fires with salad. Kids menu is very good. Average service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
7,Jessica M.,"Fort Irwin, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-07,I only gave one star because I couldn't give zero. Staff was very rude. I waited over 10 minutes at the front to be greeted. Only to learn I needed to go to the bar to get my to go order. Where I waited another 20 to pay and get my food. I had called ahead and theY told me the food would be ready between 12:55-1:00. I arrived at 1:02. The bartender was extremely rude. She was slamming things down on the counter and having an argument in front of customers. It was a very unpleasant experience. I had never tried Red Robin before and I won't go back. When we finally got the food the burger was dry and the fries were cold. And you would've thought that me asking for ketchup packets was literally the end of the world. They need to re-evaluate staff. And definitely be retrained on customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
0,Abbie T.,"Cincinnati, OH",27,14,3.0,5.0,2017-07-05,"You want a burger!? Yeah, baby! You want an amazing, ""make you glad you came"" Burger!? Yeah baby! You want bottomless garlic parmesan fries and freaking amazing Strawberry shakes right in the mall!? Yes folks, the MALL! The American staple. The best place to establish your independence as a middle-schooler! Tuttle Crossing!  Well, you want it!? YEAH BABY!? Well then, come by the Red Robin at Tuttle. I had the Bleu Ribbon burger and was so happy with it. Bleu cheese, tangy Heinz sauce and onion straws, on an Onion bun.... Mmmmmm. My man cub had the little doggie corn dogs, which are super cute. The garlic fries my dad had were awesome, and they have that really delicious ranch... You know the one, the kind you find at only some restaurants that results in you declaring to your table, ""This is that GOOD ranch!"". We shared a kid sized Strawberry milkshake which was so so good, I was really surprised. It was a pleasurable experience, and I could shop a little after with no effort but to waltz out the door into the mall. Hope you enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
1,Adrianne G.,"Columbus, OH",0,18,,1.0,2017-09-21,"The food here is like a typical Red Robin, burgers are good....but the fries have been stale the past couple of times we've gone. Service here is awful, we give a restaurant three tries before giving up and finding a better place. Servers are good at greeting you and getting drinks, but it's all downhill from here. They offer bottomless fries, but it's pointless. It takes them 5-10 minutes to actually bring out another helping after the rest of your food is cold. If there's another Red Robin nearby, go there. Or anywhere else. We ended up waiting 15 minutes for them to apply a coupon to our meal, absolutely ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dublin,,,,,
