57,Taylor M.,"Birmingham, AL",59,227,29.0,3.0,2013-03-01,"Overall I give CPK 4 stars because I absolutely LOVE their white pizza with bacon, their pesto penne, and their butter cake (oh my, that cake is the stuff dreams are made of). The three stars is due to our most recent experience, which is memorialized for all time (or until I edit after a return visit) below: My husband and I had a pretty frustrating experience the last time we visited this location, and we haven't been able to bring ourselves to return. My eye starts to twitch when we mention it. Just to tell the tale brings back unpleasant memories... Our server was a very sweet young twenty-something, but oh so forgetful - she forgot to put in part of our order, then once it was in, my pizza came out wrong and had to be re-done. While I waited for my pizza, I asked for her to bring out a quick appetizer, which never came.... because she forgot to put it in. My pizza finally came and was great, but my husband had finished his by then. Both our glasses were dry more often than they were full. To conclude, we tried the new salted caramel pudding, but it came out without whipped cream (they were out..?) We got a butter cake to go just because the pudding was so sad in comparison, and my taste buds were not satisfied. In the end, our dear little waitress said the manager was going to take care of one of our pizzas due to all of the issues, which was so nice and we were very  appreciative (we aren't the types to gripe about anything to get free food - we just don't come back - so it was great they recognized that they had provided pretty poor service and wanted to try to make it up to us). In our minds, all was set right. After a LONG while, she brought the check, but it was for the wrong table (a HUGE table, like $100 difference between our tab and theirs). We smiled, and just gave her our card to save another trip, and asked her to go ahead and swipe it for the correct tab. Unfortunately, our correct ticket did not have a comped pizza... Sad face. After being so pleasantly surprised by the idea of a free pizza, it was such a let down. And at that point we really just felt so bad for the girl (bless her heart, seriously) and didn't dare ask for it to be corrected and end up having to wait another 30 minutes. So we kept the check as it was. The hubs and I are both past servers ourselves, so we always tip well... but tipping on both pizzas, plus a to go butter cake, after some of the worst service we have ever had, left a bad taste in our mouths. It was a lesson in showing grace! So... big sigh...  Basically, the food at every CPK chain has been consistent for me over the years, and I love the butter cake - so we'll be back. I just need a little time to forget that, shudder, nails-on-chalkboard experience. Writing this review probably just set me back another two months.

Like too many large sweaty men and messy kids have sat in the same booth before you, but you can't really see the damage because of the poor lighting. Ok, that being said, I'm still addicted to their pizza. Sometimes the food is great and sometimes it's gawd-awful. The same goes for the servers.

I love you, but this past weekend I did not love your takeout service.   My dad and I waited to order at the restaurant itself so we could take our time looking over the menu and enjoy a drink. The servers were friendly and let us have plenty of time to decide what we wanted.  I ordered my go-to favorite California Club pizza on a wheat crust with a side of alfredo sauce and my pop got the Sicilian pizza.  It only took about 20 minutes for the order to come through and we were on our merry 3 minute drive back to the hotel to enjoy. My dad will eat anything and lets no food go to waste so of course he polished off his pie, but not to supreme enjoyment. My pizza was cold, somewhat dry,and the crust was tough. The side of alfredo sauce was also forgotten in the bag which potentially could have helped with the dry taste. I won't let this experience tarnish my love for CPK too much.

42,David B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",94,313,539.0,4.0,2014-07-26,"I held off on writing this review for a couple of weeks, as we had some significant issues with the dinner. With that said I cannot recollect an instance where a management team took a more proactive approach to correct the wrongs and ensure guest satisfaction.  The dinner: If you haven't been to this location there's a parking structure around the corner where you come in through the back stairwell and have to hunt to find the front of the restaurant.  After getting to the front we were relatively quickly seated. The server came by relatively quickly with water and then took quite some time to bring the bread and olive oil. After taking some time ourselves and thinking what we would like to have we ended up deciding to split two entrées. The reason it took so long was they had a loyalty program on the table but you couldn't just fill out the card you had to complete an online form in order to utilize the loyalty program. This caused us to change our order several times as we thought through what we'd like to eat.  David our waiter took our order to the kitchen.   The problem: We asks for both dishes to be split one being a salad the other being a pizza that we were going to have after we completed the salad. After about 15 minutes the salad and pizza came out at the same time without being split. We knew that David had taken the order correctly however it just was not communicated to the kitchen. As we were both kind of frustrated at that point we stated out loud that we were probably not coming back to this restaurant.  Next: This is where the manager Jennifer jumped in. She right away took the pizza back and said that they were going to cook us a fresh new one. A minute later our old pizza came right back to the table. My guest and I were both extremely disappointed. Jennifer seeing this came back toward table instantly took the pizza back and apologized.  Resolution: In the end Jennifer took the pizza off the tab gave us a fresh new one and boxed up the other one for us to take home.   So you might ask how can I possibly be giving this place four stars.... First: They worked harder to make up for their service issues than any other time I've had a dinner out, not an over comp, just making things right.  Second: Ultimately the food was fantastic!! The California Fields salad with strawberries and watermelon was refreshing delicious crisp sweet crunchy with the nuts just a fantastic dining experience. The wild mushroom pizza was buttery yummy cheesy  with crisp pizza dough exactly what you want when you order a gourmet style pizza. The drinks which were a little bit overpriced were delicious. The strawberry rhubarb martini had the heart yet sweet qualities that you want in a martini especially one that is fruit based. The mai tai was divine and I would strongly recommend that drink.  No this was not my best dining experience but at the end of the day people are human and will make mistakes. Seeing how this restaurant made up for those mistakes the quality of the food and the overall effort put forth deserves the recognition of four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-dallas?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.184,2.96

12,Dan L.,"Dallas, TX",79,240,24.0,4.0,2016-02-24,"CPK is a great place to take your kids and have a family meal.  I like this restaurant.  It's close to home, it's full of neighborhood kids hanging out in groups.  There are lots of booths and a great atmosphere.  I can see my kids going here on their own when they're older. Is this the place to get artisanal thin crust wood oven pizza?  No.  But it's a place that always brings a smile to my kids.  It's a casual and friendly place, bustling with young families, young adults and teenagers who are having a good time.  OK, it's not fine dining, or even an upscale restaurant but the decor is good, the service was friendly and the food and atmosphere fit the bill for a family dinner.  My kids love to come here so I'll give it 4 stars cause it works for my family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-dallas,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

Not too loud or bright inside. It was a nice dinner setting. I selected the garlic fettuccine which wasn't all that impressive. Okay, but nothing stood out to me. My son ordered his favorite kind of pizza, BBQ Chicken. It was a small pizza that was more than enough for a 10 year old. The other guests at the table split the two salad which was delicious.

0,Walt A.,"Dallas, TX",55,9,25.0,5.0,2017-07-20,"Over the years I've gone to CPK off and on, however, these past 2-3 years my partner and I are regulars and actually like their food. As a foodie I've seen several restaurants fold and shut down over the years. This is due to the customer service and many of these restaurant chains just don't know how to dig themselves out of the hole. CPK has gone through their ups and downs. The key is to maintain profitability through outstanding customer service. I've been very observant over the years and noticed that CPK has changed with the way the market continuously changes. For CPK, its all about marketing. For example, their menus are very colorful with tasteful professional photos that literally make your mouth water when looking at some menu items. Not every dish is photographed BUT they know how to sell it on a visual level. I really like how they suggest a wine pairing with any of their main plates. Classy but not over the top. CUSTOMER SERVICE Then you have the human factor involved- the wait service. We usually request for Tracy S. who's been with CPK for many years at this particular location. She always makes our visit enjoyable and is a prime example of what every CPK server should be like- very attentive AND she knows her dishes very well. When observing her with other customers, she often would upsell items without pressuring them. She often makes suggestions and whether the customer would go with her suggestion or not, her verbal delivery is always professional and with a smile.  BEVERAGES I'm not a big drinker but I usually order my favorite Strawberry Mango Cooler. A refreshing beverage that is non-alcoholic. It's made of fresh strawberries hand-shaken with Fresca and Monin South Seas, featuring natural flavors of mango, guava and ginger. This drink definitely would go with any dish on their menu. APPETIZERS/SALAD Before our main course, we shared a Petite Wedge Salad which is topped with bleu cheese dressing, Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, chopped egg and Roma tomatoes. Tracy, our server, suggested that we get it chopped up and it sure was easier to split for sharing between two people.  MAIN COURSE This evening I ordered the Hearth-Roasted Halibut which is a wild-caught halibut caught in the Pacific Northwest, roasted on a cedar plank. The presentation is done very well with the halibut placed on top of a bed of grilled asparagus and creamy farro with butternut squash and baby kale. Absolute heaven in your mouth.  I tried this halibut dish when it was first showcased on their menu. When I took a bite out of it, the fish was over cooked. I didn't say anything to Tracy about this until months later when I decided to give this dish a try. It was obvious that the cooks really did not know how to cook this type of fish. Remember, not every fish is alike. Halibut is usually cooked for 20 minutes if closed on grill whereas cooking this fish on an open top would take 10 minutes. Keep in mind, salmon has been on their menu for quite sometime so I'm guessing the cooks used the same time to cook the halibut just like how they cook the salmon. So, on my second attempt with this halibut dish, my meal turned out beyond perfect. Even the manager, Michelle, came by to see if it was to my liking. You really don't get this type of attention and service in a casual restaurant.  My other half ordered the Cedar Planked Salmon which is North Atlantic salmon roasted on a cedar plank in our hearth oven with smoked paprika and lime. Served with white corn & spinach succotash and topped with Feta. He particularly likes the succotash and how it compliments the fish. Both fish dishes, the salmon and halibut, are cooked on a cedar plank which gives the fish a nice smoky cedar taste and really compliments the fish overall.  DESSERT To finish it off, we shared the Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake topped off with a scoop of vanilla Hagen Das ice cream. Warm chocolate cake served with triple-thick hot fudge, housemade whipped cream and cacao nibs. Add a cup of coffee and you've got a perfect pairing. Excellent taste and nicely presented. OVERALL EXPERIENCE/SUGGESTIONS Overall, CPK has really cleaned up their act over the past 3-4 years. I like to see how these restaurants fight to stay afloat. I believe CPK corporate team is open minded to utilize at their front line employees (like their servers/wait staff) and allow them to grow by marketing catering services to local neighboring businesses. Very clever idea which you rarely see today.  As for my five star, well, they meet my expectations. There is definitely room for improvement. I like the fact that they are continuously and consistently updating their menu items introducing healthy dishes that many customers look experience. They also continue to market at all levels and like to hear feedback- this location in particular. Keep in mind, not all locations operate at a high level like this location in particular. Overall, great food and experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-dallas,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
