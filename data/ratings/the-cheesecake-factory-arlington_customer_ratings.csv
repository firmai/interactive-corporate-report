310,Mia N.,"Alexandria, VA",22,307,92.0,2.0,2012-01-09,"I don't know why I keep on coming to this chain.  We went in Naples, Florida last year and it was average and blah, so I should have known better when we went again 2 weeks ago to the Clarendon location.  I really wanted to buy stocking holders on sale at Pottery Barn, which weren't even there, and which I should have just gotten on line, but they had sold out online!  Anyway, I got excited thinking we could have good food here.  Never again.  I would rather go cheap and just find a Taco Bell for sustenance than spend another $50 here when I could spend that same $50 on at least 3 days worth of snacks and food from Trader Joe's or Shopper's. We made the mistake of ordering the nachos, which we or I gobbled up as I was famished. They weren't even that great.  Not that much salsa and no chili. Just fried chips with globs of greasy melted cheese.  The best nachos are at Numero Uno and Hard Rock Cafe.  Anyway, I was so full I couldn't eat my entree, a southwestern barbeque salad, which was tasteless.  Not enough dressing.  It was a wasted $9.95 and I didn't even eat it.  The corn wasn't even sweet.  The menu is just too much and full of  heavy sleep inducing fattening foods that I always choose a salad, which ends up not being that great.   Next time if I ever go here again, I will just order an appetizer and just eat the complimentary bread.  That's enough.  My hubby got a $14 burger.  I yelled at him.  He said he didn't realize his kobe burger was that much.  $14 for a freaking burger?  If he wanted a burger we could have gone to Burger King for a $3 burger.   Cheesecake Factory was and is a total waste of money.  Oh, and my kid's macaroni and cheese was absolutely miserable, greasy, and the pasta was undercooked and chewy.  We brought it home and miked it for my kid, and it had like 3 tablespoons of pure liquid oil/fat.  When I make home made/baked from scratch mac and cheese, I have never seen droplets let alone puddles of oil.   The only good thing is the cheesecake, which is light and airy and, which I bought on the way out.  No sense in adding it to the total bill so that I'd have to tip the guy more.  Anyways, our service was fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=220,2.76,2.76,2.76,3.0480000000000005,2.76

Only downfall was that we were pressed on time and it took a little while for the food to cook.

They're catering to the family set, the bar set, the ""trendy, hip & modern"" set and the dessert crowd without being definitively one or another. I can see why Cheesecake Factory does well in mega-malls, but Clarendon? There are plenty of places that aren't horrifying corporate frankensteins that are within walking distance of Cheesecake Factory. There's no parking lot here, so you're going to be paying for parking one way or another, so why compound matters by going to a chain? I've been here a handful of times, and every time it's been loud. Loud Loud Loud. You don't have to shout to be heard, but you're pretty damn close. The food is palatable, but only because it hinges off the hack cooking technique of adding butter to everything. Paula Deen would be proud, I guess, but if I'm looking for greasy spoon-level food, I'm not looking for it to cost as much as it does here, nor am I looking for it to be presented in a goofy manner that some executive board thinks is ""haute cuisine.""

Buzz me when my table is ready, not when the busboy hasn't gotten to it yet. All the food is mediocre. The tables always seem too close to each other so we're right on top of other annoying people. The entrees are obscenely huge and filled with thousands of calories. And anyone who still has room for cheesecake after an appetizer and entree is probably overweight and has or is soon to get diabetes.  But, it remains a good meeting spot for large groups of people with different tastes, and doesn't seem to care how long you linger around even late hours. And of course the best appetizer is there - the buffalo blasts. One time they said they ran out of them, so we left! I usually stick with something safe and simple like the spicy crispy sandwich.

133,Chris J.,"Arlington, VA",0,1,,1.0,2013-01-24,I went here for dinner with a friend last night and all I can say is wow that was some of the worst service I've had and the worst food I have tasted in a very long time. Starting with drinks when our server asked what kettle one was for a extra dirty martini we both stared at her shocked.. She then asks us how to spell kettle one!! Are u kidding me??!! Then when the extra dirty martini comes out it is very clear that its a regular dirty martini as both my date and I work at 2 different bars so we have to ask for extra olive juice that takes the server almost 10 minutes to bring out in a shot ass that has clearly been dropped and is chipped and has a crack going down half of the glass. As for ordering food this server comes up to our table not 2 minutes after we open our menus to see if we are ready... No shit were not ready sifting through 15 pages of adds mixed into their menu figuring out what we want... We get our apps some salad and Thai wrap both were the only good thing about the whole experience but then our entrees show up and they take our Thai wrap before we are done with it.. Wtf is wrong with u people ask if we are done before u take our plates.  Entrees .... How can I describe the worst food we have had in a long time.. She got the gumbo and nothing about it said gumbo the rice was completely over cooked  nothing on her plate was cooked properly and it was not thick like gumbo should be and she ate the chicken out of it and left the rest saying if she had a dog she wouldn't even feed the leftovers to him... As for me I had the shrimp scampi and how hard it is to cook pasta with some sort of flavor?? ..not hard at all I do it at home all the time but wow this was the most bland pasta and over cooked I have ever tasted ... And deep fried shrimp ..really if u want good scampi try sautéing them or grilling them instead  Dessert.. Cheesecake of course and at least they got that right .. Maybe this is all they should carry because clearly that's the only thing they can make correctly Service... Holy crap our server should go back to training and honestly probably never serve I finished my first drink around our apps and set my ass at the end of table clear that it was empty and she never once cleared it or asked if I would care for another I'm not going to beg u for alcohol so she missed out on me having at least 3 drinks And same goes for my friend she finished her drink and the glass was just left there through dinner.. So fuck it we drank water and planned to get drinks elsewhere with friends ... As for the water I don't think there is a water shortage but for some reason our water glasses stayed empty for half of the dinner before we had to ask for water and that took her 5 minutes at least to get and we were one of maybe 5 tables in the whole place. Overall I would never go back there are many other places in Clarendon that are so much better and honestly I would rather eat at Taco Bell Mc Donald's or any other fast food joint before I step foot back in Cheesecake Factory,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=260,3.56,3.2,3.2,2.5960000000000005,3.3440000000000007

230,Joshua W.,"Arlington, VA",33,76,30.0,4.0,2013-04-13,"Normally I steer clear of national franchise food, but in the case of Cheesecake Factory I am glad to have made an exception. The atmosphere is a bit overwhelming and the meal is VERY fast paced, but this is pretty standard for a national chain and the surprising food quality makes is a very good option for a family outing. It feels like the floor is full of more servers, managers, bussers, hosts, and hostesses then customers. For the amount of people running around the dining room you would think the service would be spectacular, but there are some small refinements that could help improve it. Clearing plates, checking in on empty drinks, and double checking in on the food would bring the service up to 5 star, but for now I'll leave it at three. The food both times was really amazing. Shepard's pie and skinny burger were particularly good. Of course the cheesecake is great too. We ordered a Reeces cheesecake to go and between the whipped cream and the slice a full sized to-go container was brimming with delicious sugary carbs!

I used to come for happy hour with a friend of mine, but it's been at least 6 months since the last time I came to this location. Food was always good, but the service never was. But I enjoyed girl time so we didn't really pay much attention. **First problem: took 7 to 10 minutes for our server to stop at the table. And I'm not even joking. Having been a server for 4 years, I KNOW you are supposed to stop at your table w/i the first 2 minutes. For all I know it could have exceeded 10 minutes b/c I was chatting up my friend and looking over the menu. The server stopped by with bread and no waters. Could have at least had the bread in 1 hand and the 2 mugs w/ handles in the other. Work smarter not harder right?  **Second problem: the service was crap. When he dropped off the waters he didn't ask if we wanted to order appetizers. Just jetted off to get our drinks from the bar which took like 8 minutes. That was a little annoying because we wanted to order appetizers and had to wait. Didn't even get to interject that we wanted to order appetizers before he ran off to put in the drink order. Then, we never saw our server between the time our food hit the table and the time we asked for our check.  **Third problem: the  entrees were HORRIBLE! I've ordered both of these dishes before a few times at other locations (Steak Diane and Skinnilicious Turkey Burger) and they were so disgusting. We hardly touched our food. The turkey burger tasted like the meat had gone bad and they cooked it and served it. It was so dry and just had the worst flavor. And like I said, I've ordered it several times before and it's delicious...but at other locations (McLean and Woodbridge). The Steak Diane, which is not my favorite to begin with, was horrible. I have never cared for it b/c the cut of meat is terrible and tough, but the sauce was just overly disgusting this time. My friend that ordered it hardly ate any of it, and for some reason took it home with him. *shakes head* So needless to say, $80 wasted and I should have gone with my gut feeling and driven the extra 10 miles to McLean to the Tyson's Galleria location.

It's best to be enjoyed when you haven't had it within the past 24 or so hours. What took off a star was the price of the cheesecakes.

I popped in the other night to meet a friend in the area for a drink and had a couple of glasses of champagne (because they can't mess that up). The bartenders were great considering how busy they were. Overall it was a pleasant experience but that had more to do with my companion then the restaurant.

The tortilla chips were authentic & good - not Tostitos out of the bag! The entree I had, Shepard Pie, was definitely calorie filled but it was delicious! The serving size was huge! Needless to say, I needed a box! And of course, the cheesecake! They seriously have like 30 different kinds of cheesecake. I got Oreo Fantasy Cheesecake. It was very good. I was just so full that i was ready to explode by the time I got to desert. TIP: Get the cheesecake to go for later. This place is a 3-4 star place.

(Only when I'm sure I'll still have room for cheesecake, of course.)  I still find the better part of valor is to split the plate in half and plan to take the second half home for leftovers. (Or I guess you could share with whoever you're eating with and not have any left to enjoy later . . . but I'm not that nice.)  That said, there are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better, but I thoroughly enjoy The Cheesecake Factory as a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount (in a severe understatement) of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good. Don't go to the Cheesecake Factory for a nice quiet meal unless you can sit outside -- in the comparative calm of a bustling street -- or hit the narrow window between lunch and dinner.  Otherwise it can be a study in controlled chaos, noisewise -- the most romantic meal will leave you hoarse from yelling to each other by the end of the night.  That said, as with all The Cheesecake Factories, the dark wood, black leather cushions, and deep red, orange, and brass (?) decoration -- as well as the myriad booths -- keeps the atmosphere warm and intimate despite the size of the restaurant. My only wish is that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best.  So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have become extinct, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=180,3.4,3.23,3.23,3.088,3.298

I waited almost 15 minutes before someone would come and take an order. The main course came earlier than the side dish. I thought the side dish comes before the main course? Maybe I am wrong and they do it completely opposite here. My disappointment came when I heard they had discontinued the white bean hummus.

He was also slow with the drink order delivery.    The menu is expansive and they offered 20+ cheesecakes PLUS other desserts as well.

When our food came out mine went to the table next me and the at the table lady ate the side and then our waiter realized he messed up so he took it from her and gave it to me and said she didn't touch it. I work at a restaurant and this is a health code violation. So it sat at the table in front off me until I could find him.

Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated.

I had a awful experience there about six weeks ago I sat outside, waited 15 minutes after another waitress sat me and got me a water while I looked at the drink menu. After what seemed to be forever, the waiter showed up 15 minutes later. I decided to have salmon and steak medium rare. Someone from the kitchen eventually brought us our food and I sampled a bit while waiting for our waiter or someone to order refills on our drinks and ask for A1 sauce. The steak was well done instead of medium rare so I just sat there thirsty and nibbling on the rest of my food that didn't taste like beef jerky. For so many reasons I rarely ever send my food back when it's wrongbut I would've made an exception this time. It would've been nice for the waiter to actually come by since I hadn't seen him since I ordered and I've been out of water since I started eating.  I noticed the other waitress also finally appeared after a 15 minute absence. she came back outside with a nearly empty pitcher of ice water, topped off the first two tables, then disappeared again. As All of this was going on for some crazy desperate reason the host sat several other tables outside instead of telling them that there was a wait and give them the option to sit inside. Sitting 3-4 other tables outside over a 20 min period was disrespectful and careless. This included a large group behind me that waited about 15 minutes before anyone even stopped at their table and that randomly ended up being some guy who said he was a manager. When he stopped by my table I ordered two waters and both of them the cars that it battery died and I got to give it a minute to fucking see if of them had and they had so little icewater 10 sure that I wouldn't run out and a few minutes later I have two waters with almost 0 ice which made no sense.  it still irks me so here I am creating a yelp account just to get it off my chest and hope I'll stop remembering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=180,3.08,3.3,3.3,2.724,3.2120000000000006

58,Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,898.0,3.0,2014-12-09,"How I heard of this place: Introduced by my sister, we never fail to return. Type of cuisine: A typical corporate-style chain establishment, with a variety of options including pizzas, salads, burgers, and pastas in flavors inspired by Mexico, Italy, North America,and beyond. Ambiance: A large establishment, with high ceilings, yellowed walls and decorative glass light fixtures, both hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. Dark brown, wooden backed booths and chair-table seating (in the bar as well) can be found throughout the small spaces created in the venue. Music plays in the background on this evening, sometimes loudly, as the hustle and bustle of restaurant spaces can be heard and felt. Patrons are not shy to speak to their dining companions aloud, but rarely do conversation topics make it to the neighboring tables. The staff, clad in white jeans and button-up shirts, white aprons and shoes are never far away, very friendly and eager to please. At the entrance, like other Factories, hostesses smile behind a large wood and granite slab-lined podium, awaiting the name and number in your party. As you wait for your name to be called, one can visit the cheesecakes and seven-layer cakes on display at the take-away counter, or make your selections for dessert! The tiled floor always sparkles with shine, as your party is guided to its seats. Tall, green plants create a sense of nature in an otherwise dimly-lit, modern-Romanesque setting. Windows along the front side of the establishment look out over the beach, and the beautiful summer sky as it changes from blue to orange to pink with the setting sun. What I ordered: Buffalo Blasts ($9.95) to start! Atlantic salmon next, one Herb Crusted Salmon ($12.95) with red-skinned mashed potatoes and asparagus in a creamy lemon-butter sauce,and one Simply Grilled Salmon ($12.95) with mashed potatoes and four large spears of asparagus. One Fresh Lemonade ($3.95), sweet and tart, with a ring of sugar on the cups rim to complete the meal. On a return visit, Monday, 21 January 2013: We returned to the Cheesecake Factory on our way back from the 57th Presidential Inauguration at the National Mall in Washington, DC, and after a 3-mile walk, to satisfy his craving for Buffalo Blasts ($10.95) and two orders of Fresh Grilled Salmon ($14.95 each), served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. What I loved: The spicy buffalo blasts, served samosa style were crispy, slightly hot with the buffalo sauce and tempered with the blue cheese in a thick ranch-flavored dip. The salmon, soft and tender, light, flaky and fresh, paired well with the creamy, buttered mashed potatoes. The asparagus drenched in a puddle of lemon-butter sauce were savored until the last bite. Why I loved it: The lunch portions were reasonable and filling and the food consistently good. You know what you are going to get at the Cheesecake Factory, and I have never been disappointed. Cost: Average to high ($9.95-$19.95 per lunch entree)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=120,3.08,3.29,3.29,3.0200000000000005,3.206

I hadn't been to C.F. in almost a year because Ive been trying non-chain, mom and pop type places since moving to this big city. When I got a gift card for Xmas I was actually excited to go back. What a disappointment.The food was not good at all. I get the same thing all the time. When I went in the past it has never been this bad. I had buffalo blasts for appetizer. The first one was OK but the second one I bit into tasted like uncooked chicken. I tossed that one and tried another and it was half OK and the other half had like grissley (really can't think of the right word to describe the taste) chicken. I gave up. I had already ordered my entree so just waited for something better to come. The crab cakes were just okay not good but the fries were stale. I didn't even take my leftovers and we all know at C.F. there are usually leftovers. Don't go to this C.F. until they get new chefs.

Overall, we had a great meal with good food and service. We were there for a very late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday afternoon, so while there was a 20 minute wait to sit in a booth, there was no wait to sit at a table. Considering we were starving, we opted for a table. During our time dining, it was the middle of a shift change, but unlike other restaurants where you don't end up seeing either of your servers, at Cheesecake Factory, that wasn't the case as both of our friendly waitresses were attentive and kept coming by to check on us. Also, I don't know if I've just never noticed the music playlist before (because usually the restaurant is packed and super noisy), but honestly, it sounded like I was listening to my own iTunes playlist, can't beat perfectly curated music to accompany dining.  Our waitress gladly fulfilled our request to have two loaves of the pumpernickel bread, rather than have one of each. It had been such a long time since I had been to The Cheesecake Factory that it was nice to be able to order some of my old staples and have them taste just the way I wanted them to. I ordered the Raspberry Lemonade - super sweet with a sugared rim, one of my favorites and the crusted chicken romano. I was surprised that this Cheesecake Factory didn't come by and ask if I wanted freshly grated parmesan cheese on my pasta like all the other locations used to do, but there was some cheese already on the pasta so it wasn't a big deal. The one disappointment was I ordered the Reese's Peanut Butter Cake Cheesecake. There were supposed to be chunks of peanut butter cups in the layer of original cheesecake, but my piece didn't have a single peanut butter cup, which kind of defeated the purpose of me ordering this cheesecake because it was supposed to have cheesecake. I reached out to Cheesecake Factory via the guest comment portion of their website just to let them know that the cheesecake they were serving didn't match the description online and suggested they change the name if it wasn't going to include peanut butter cups. While the cheesecake was good, it just wasn't what I had ordered. I was extremely surprised when I checked my mailbox and found they had responded with a letter and sent me a gift card to come back.

The service is attentive and welcoming, the food portions are rightfully ginormous, and the atmosphere is a mix of the after-dinner crowd, birthday party, and family of four. But consistency isn't always the best thing. Cheesecake Factory's food always tends to be a bit...much. Whether it's size, seasoning, or flavor, the food isn't up to par with smaller establishments. This time around, I ordered Godiva Cheesecake on our server's recommendation for something chocolate. The chocolate was overpoweringly rich, cloyingly sweet, and paired inexplicably with two mountains of whipped cream. Not to say it didn't meet expectations for ""chocolate"", but the cheesecake itself just felt a bit much. Perhaps what separates Cheesecake Factory from other restaurants is subtlety in the dishes it creates.

On my last visit I actually ended up sitting on a booth with a couple of friends and dinner was satisfying and was very enjoyable. I'm a big fan of pasta , so I've tried a few of their pasta here and it was never disappointing.  Last night's garlic pasta with shrimp was equally as yummy. I can't say my friends would have agreed with me especially with the garlic breath that came with it.  Just remember to bring a gum if you are going to have this and never order this if you are here on a date. They have a huge menu here and you can find everything from burgers , salad to pastas and steaks. The best thing of all , not only they have different kind of food but have different variety of it as well. They have like 10 over different kinds of burgers.  It's really hard to pick out what you want to eat at times. Since it can get a little over whelming with the large selection. They give a very generous portion here, which I tend to finish because I like pig out. Most of the friends that I've been here always end up bringing some home. You must have some sort of game plan when you come to  Cheesecake Factory. Take it easy on the appetizer and entree , so you can actually have room for CHEESECAKE !

I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory and pretty much everything they offer and my last visit was nothing different. We were there on a weekday evening, we didn't need to wait, but for weekends there will be a very long wait- and no you can't make reservations.  We were sat and our waiter quickly asked us for our drink order, and promptly brought them to us. We started off with the fried zucchini, yum, one of my fav appetizers they have, it's simple and delicious. We then ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and the chicken costoletta. Both were served hot and were delicious! Cheesecake Factory has very large portions, for a pretty decent price, so plan on taking a box home!.. you need to save room for desert!  For desert we had the red velvet cheesecake and Linda's fudge cake...drool, both were very good.  The food was great, but what really made this visit for us was our waiter, Eliezer. Seriously if you go to this location, ask for him. he was on top of everything and SO polite. He definitely gets my favorite server of the month lol. Like I said, try to plan ahead of you plan on going here on the weekends, there will be a wait.

We walked in and despite three people (who I assume were employees based on their clothes) standing at the reception desk, we were not greeted or welcomed. After waiting for 5 minutes, one of the said three people showed us to our table.  Our server showed up with menus and asked about drinks. We ordered a pizza and while it did arrive in around 15 minutes or so, it tasted no better than frozen pizza. I'm still struggling to figure out why I would pay so much for something so greasy and tasteless. Water would have helped during this ordeal but our server was no where to be found.  After waiting till what seemed like eternity, our server finally came around and asked about dessert- we ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  The cheesecake was pretty yummy and we were glad that at least there was something redeeming about our visit. The service was exceedingly poor. Yes, I realize that we went in pretty late but if they can't manage past a certain time, why remain open till 1 am?  The pizza was awful. It is not something that I will be going back for. Ever.

68,Nichole U.,"Manassas, VA",14,16,,1.0,2015-06-20,"As I looked up The Cheesecake Factory's website after this visit, I was informed that it was very kid friendly. So I was a little baffled as to how the 1 year old in our group was not accommodated at all. I live in Manassas. So my friend & I drove all the way out to Arlington to see our friend, her husband, & their baby. This was their first visit to a sit down restaurant after having a child, by the way. My friend & I arrived early & asked for a table for four plus a high chair for the baby. The three hosts looked extremely confused about life, so I repeated myself. When they finally sat us down they did not bring a high chair. I wasn't too worried about it at first bc I figured out server would do so after the rest of our group & the child arrived.  I was wrong. His name was Hansell & I made a point to remember it. He saw the parents holding the child & not once did he bring a high chair when asked or even offer a booster seat or kids menu or anything. This really irritated me bc he saw my friends taking turns holding the baby so that they could eat. That is just completely ridiculous! Then the friend that I rode up w never received any of the condiments he ordered. My food came out wrong & ten minutes before everyone else's food. Then once the food runners brought the rest of the food, Hansell disappeared. For a long time. I was never asked if I wanted another glass of wine. My friends drinks weren't refilled as well. Then when he reappeared, he put the check all together & just left it at the end of the table & walked away. Before this, I was going to order a dessert. It is the Cheesecake Factory after all. But he gave us a really dirty dessert menu, which I know he saw because he opened it to the page for us before handing it over & it had food all over it. Then he disappeared again for so long I was just over the entire thing. So after waiting twenty more minutes he came back to retrieve the check & I told him we were not on the same check (but thanks for asking bc that was a pretty odd assumption to make) & asked if he could split it. Disappears again & we all kicked ourselves for not having any cash bc we knew it would take him forever to process the cards.  The food was decent, but my friends felt like they were a nuisance for bringing their 1 year old son with them to lunch. It wasn't busy. I feel that they could've been way more accommodated for the hefty prices on the menu & the easy 80$ our checks were combined (which would've been more if he ever asked about a wine refill or checked to see if my friend had decided on a cocktail). I feel as if he was about to be off & just didn't care at all about us as guests. It was a really bad look, Cheesecake. I expected more from you specifically as a restaurant. I am appalled at the terrible service they received & am really upset on their behalf. Parents bring their kids so they don't have to cook or clean. It's a break for them which they needed desperately. Instead, they were forced to take turns holding the baby so that they could eat their meals. Completely ridiculous. Hansell should have been trained better. It is pretty obvious that a 1 year old needs a high chair or at least a booster seat. It is also sad that while it was so slow we never got what we asked for. Needless to say, I don't think that my friends will be coming out again with their son for quite some time. Most of our visit was us trying to convince them that there was something wrong with Hansell & that bringing their baby to lunch was not at all an inconvenience. Especially to a restaurant who welcomes children which is what their website claimed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=140,3.16,3.18,3.18,2.6600000000000006,3.1720000000000006

So Im out with an old friend I haven't seen in forever and we're in a great mood. I go to order a drink from the bar but I ask the bartender (Tania b. - who's awesome btw) if she can make the drink less sweet than the way it normally comes. (it's a common practice for cocktails to have a flavored corn syrup added.) Well this cocky obnoxious tall brown-head guy (I wish I would've heard his name once so I could mention it) standing next to her makes a huge scene and starts mocking me like oh u want it less sweet?! What do u think this is?!! KFC??!! Hahahhahha!! And goes on and on with HIMSELF... Well first, that just instantly dampened our mood having the bartender jeering me for such a simple request...like wow. Excuse meeeee. That must have been way too much to ask!  FYI, it could be the taste people don't like of too sweet, it could be insulin or glucose issues, or it could be u simply don't want to drink corn syrup if u don't have to. Anyway, u never know what's going on with the guest and mocking them is definitely not getting u ""cute, funny"" points. So I'm thinking this arrogant jerk, it's really not that difficult to hold extra syrup that you're about to pump into a drink, and second, I'm pretty sure he was referring to a slogan like ""have it your way"" from Burger King or something, but he said KFC. LOL So whatever he said didn't make sense. To makes matters worse, idk why he made our first round of drinks for Tania, but he did and they were horrible!! I think he overloaded both drinks with sweet to spite us.  I didn't say anything bc I don't like to complain and I was trying to enjoy time with my friend, but on our second round of drinks my friend actually commented the second round was MUCH better (same drink) than our first. I completely agreed, just didn't say anything in the beginning to further dampen our mood since it got off to a rough start with that guy bartender. If I wouldn't have been preoccupied with my friend trying to catch up after so long, I would've said something to management about the shit drink and the obnoxious bartender!!! Lucky him.

Not a very good experience to the point my partner said that we may need to order our food to go or just not dine there anymore which is disappointing because it's one of our favorite places and Cheesecake Factory advertises how they accommodate with braille menus and they offer high chairs, and welcome service animals....yet they don't seem to have the room for such, and we were not offered any of those things",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=200,3.12,3.15,3.15,2.7280000000000006,3.138

I don't even bother to look at the menu anymore, D or other companions can handle the novel-size menu.  This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant outside of Florida, and it was well worth the trek. Saturday evening, it was pretty packed, and we were told a wait time of 15 minutes, so grabbed a buzzer and sat on the bench.  We were seated right when they said we would, and stuck right in. The bread rolls were 2/5 for me, because although the sour dough bread looked homemade and would have been a lot nicer freshly baked, but the crust was way too stiff by the time it was brought to us, and it almost broke my jaw. I miss the honey oats rolls from the other location in Florida we used to go to.  FOOD  The main game, the tamale cakes, were on point, and it was then that I realised how much brighter it was inside this location than I was used to, because I could actually see the colours of each ingredient on the plate! The heartiness of tamale cakes, tang of salsa, fresh avocados, sour cream, and an unknown sauce all make for an awesome treat, everytime.  Service was reasonably quick and friendly, and I appreciated that the service staff didn't give us attitude when we ordered an appetiser only.  GRIEVANCE Before we decided to go in, we thought to check the menu posted outside the building to the right of the front door, but couldn't stand there for more than a couple second because of the cigarette smoke from the rubbish bin which was underneath the menu frame.

202,Laura W.,"Washington, DC",249,1152,1745.0,3.0,2016-08-08,"My boyfriend in college worked at The Cheesecake Factory and could have one meal per night to take home (up to $20-which is basically everything but steak), so I had already pretty much tried everything on the menu that I wanted to before the first time I had stepped foot in the physical location he worked since, you know, who wants to eat at their workplace on their day off. After that relationship ended, I still hardly ever made my way to The Cheesecake Factory because, frankly, after eating it so much for nearly 3 years, it was pretty boring to me, and my favorite item, the cheesecake, could be bought at the grocery store if I really wanted it that badly (which I never did). Anyways, we have a pair of friends who suggested meeting at The Cheesecake Factory to catch up over dinner, so, despite it being pretty far down my list of places I wanted to dine, I obliged since they are more of the ""chain-y type"" of diners, and this is a better chain than some other options they could have chosen. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Friday and it was not busy at all. On the one hand though, it seems like the place to go for birthdays as we witnessed the staff singing happy birthday to at least 6 different tables while we were there. After grabbing a booth, we realized our friends were already sitting at one-and they had bread and drinks-so we found them and sat down. Everyone knows that the brown bread is far superior to the other bread served, and I think most people have been to The Cheesecake Factory, so no need to be redundant on the yumminess of the honey wheat bread. For entrees, our dining companions ordered guacamole (which is served either mild, medium, or hot) with chips and chicken Marsala. Both of them seemed to enjoy their food and took leftovers home, since, as everyone knows again, portions are enough for at least two meals if not more. My boyfriend had the cashew chicken. He said it was his ""usual"" order, and he, too, ended up with leftovers. We split it the following day for lunch and wow-was it way, way, way overly salted! I kept wondering why he was drinking water like a horse during dinner and now I see why! I ordered the appetizer French county salad. It was, as expected, the size of an entrée salad, and contained beets, pickled onions, arugula, asparagus, and goat cheese in vinaigrette. I enjoyed the amount of beets in the salad, although I feel there should have been more than 3 little pieces of goat cheese in the mix. The amount of asparagus slightly made up for the lack of cheese. I appreciated the salad was lightly dressed as often salads are drenched in dressing at restaurants. Although I did not finish, I didn't take my leftovers home. Although I could have totally gone for a slice of cheesecake (preferably the Godiva chocolate cheesecake), no one else wanted dessert, and I didn't want to look like the heifer of the table, so I declined dessert as well.  While our service was slow, our server was friendly and kind of off the wall crazy but entertaining. Normally, I'd think it weird, but he kind of just made it work and was never intrusive. The Cheesecake Factory is never my first choice but it is a pretty reliable chain for those seeking out that option, and this location is quite convenient to the Clarendon metro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=60,3.16,3.09,3.18,2.668,3.118

I've been to other Cheesecake Factories before and have been very pleased when I ordered the chicken tostadas salad. This is why I usually just stick with what I know is good. They bring out white bread and pumpernickel bread which is addicting. I ate a little bit too much of that before my main dish. The chocolate cake for desert  was delicious, so no complaints there.  The waitress was on top of her game. She provided refills on my water regularly and refilled the bread frequently. I'm not too sure why they have so-called ""lunch specials"". There is nothing special about spending $17 on undercooked pasta and flavorless chicken. In addition, the presentation wasn't great. My chicken was hidden underneath the pasta.

I usually ask for extra sauce on the side and they are very good about providing more. In drinks the mint cucumber lemonade is refreshing and my favorite cheesecakes are the ultimate red velvet and  the sweet and salty caramel, although I have not tried all of them yet. These two are not super sweet and I like that about them not to mention the richness of the cheesecake itself.

The avocado egg rolls are good too as is the eggroll platter with an assorted mix of rolls and sauces.

The service is much better than any other chain of its size and there's enough options on the menu to satisfy everyone. As a matter of fact having been to dozens of their locations in the last 20 years I've never had a bad meal or a meal that doesn't come out perfect. The food here is far better than average and the portions are enough for a cow to be full. Sure the menu is so large it can be almost impossible to find something that you absolutely want because there's too many things that you want but why would one complain about that? What's amazing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they're able to do a good job on hundreds of different dishes. Most chains struggle to even do just a few things well yet at the Cheesecake Factory there's nothing that they don't do well. And for those of you that are complaining about the price let's be real. This food is priced more than fair and is actually price with a lot of value. With quality ingredients and massive portions you're getting a deal. Even just there tropical tea is worth coming for or the free bread they bring to your table. But this place is far more than that. I can think of dozens of dishes that are phenomenal. And while their gumbo may not taste like it doesn't Louisiana it's way better then your traditional chain food. Any of their sandwiches, pasta dishes, fish and massive salads are all very good. There's no point me listing exactly what I eat because you're going to spend 15 minutes just looking at the menu and coming up with 10 options that you want all on your own. Just remember not to be so hard on your reviews here the quality is much better than people give it credit for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=20,3.08,3.13,3.18,2.6719999999999997,3.11

292,Badrea G.,"Silver Spring, MD",19,2,,1.0,2017-03-10,"I have NEVER had such a negative experience at a restaurant!!Today at noon, i called the restaurant to inquire about eating in. My friend and I only have one hour to eat our lunch, and return to work. This doesnt include travel time, and seating/pick up time. I asked the hostess(-who did not introduce herself- on the phone if i would be able to place my order and have the kitchen make it ready at 1 PM for us to sit down and eat. The person on the phone said no. I then asked how long it usually takes for food to be prepared and brought out. She said about 20 minutes. With a travel time of about 5-10 minutes, this would not work for me. So I then asked if I could order for takeout, then sit down to enjoy our food. She said yes, then transferred me to someone who could take my order. Mina answered the phone. let me just establish the fact that she did not introduce herself at this time either. I did not know it was Mina that i was speaking to until a later time. At the beginning of the call I said 'Hi, how are you? I'd like to place an order for pickup, but i will be eating in the restaurant."" She said Ok, then proceded to take my order. Fast forward one hour, after a 5 minute wait to be directed to the-not labelled- pick up area, I grab my food and proced to look for seating. One of the hostess then tells me ""you guys can sit at the bar'. I tell her that we would like to sit at a booth, we choose the booth and ask for them to please wipe it down, and that we would be ordering more food and drinks, as well as tipping our server. After a 10 minute wait at the front of the restaurant, with both hostesses throwing us nasty looks and whispering to each other-they stopped as soon as they saw us looking at them-, they finally clean off the booth-after assisting about 3 other walk-ins, like we werent a priority-, and we then sit down, open our food, and begin to eat-with no drinks. No server appears, so I turn to a busboy-who was cleaning a table behind us- and ask him to please send a server over. He says OK and dissappears. Let me just establish that at this point, we were already very irritated at the service we were receiving, but were willing to give whoever our server was a chance to redeem.About 5 minutes later, Mina then comes over and says 'You guys can sit at the bar. I have customers that are waiting to sit down.' My friend asks her 'You want us to pack up our food, and move to the bar?""  We ordered a Pizza, a salad, 3 slices of cheesecake, a grilled salmon, and the avocado eggrolls. ALL of this food was spread out on the table open as we were eating. Mina responds with 'Yes, I dont want to argue with you, I have customers waiting to sit down"". As Mina would not let me speak, I then ask her(this is when I finally find out her name) ""What is your name?"", She responds with ""Mina"". I then say: ""Mina, I'm not going to argue with you either. we called and inquired about this situation and were given the clear 3 times, including by you. We only have 40 more minutes to enjoy our lunch, we are waiting for the server so we can order more, we will tip, and we are not about to pack up all this food and move clear across the restaruant."" She is adamant about us moving, tries to deny the fact that I told her over the phone that we would be eating in, and my friend is starting to get very annoyed. He cuts the ""argument"" short and says, ""forget it, I'm not even gonna talk to you rignt now, i'm leaving."" we then tell Mina: ""If we cant sit here, then were going to leave. I'd like a refund for the food."" My friend couldnt even bear to be in the restaurant and goes to stand outside in 30 degree weather with only a cardigan on, while I receive my refund. We then leave. As if everything that just happened wasnt a HUGE injustice to us, the fact that the workers couldnt even identify themselves, couldnt even crack a smile, were throwing us nasty looks like we had not just spent about $70 on our existing food and were going to spend even more AS WELL as tipping our server, and we were treated like trash by someone who as of yet hadnt even established whether she is a manager or not, we had to waste an additional $15 on the ubers we ordered to get there and back to work!I have NEVER been treated so poorly in an establishment in my entire life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=100,3.08,3.13,3.18,2.212,3.11

To be clear, this is probably not a restaurant I would ever actually go to. My experience with this location has been limited to non-sober Postmates experiences only. That being said, they're named The Cheesecake Factory for a reason - it's because their cheesecake is phenomenal and they goddamn know it.  Cheesecakes I have tried:  ~ Fresh banana cream: perfect ~ Lemon meringue: perfect ~ Chocolate hazelnut crunch (with hot fudge): perfect ~ Godiva chocolate cheesecake: perfect ~ Tiramisu: perfect ~ Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple: perfect, although if I remember correctly, this is one of the highest in calories ~ Key lime: good ~ Mango key lime: kind of weird. It had an unpleasant gelatinous texture that cheesecake just shouldn't have. I still ate it, but it was definitely my least favorite. ~ Dutch apple caramel streusel: they've been out of this every time I've tried to order it so probably just don't bother. In summation, for cheesecake-based review only, I'm gonna have to go with a 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington,2.8,3.07,3.176,2.804,2.9619999999999997
271,Peyton L.,"Beaufort, NC",2,19,1.0,4.0,2017-07-31,There's nothing cheesy about this Cheesecake Factory! Come and get it! These are catch phrases that my family thought would for some reason describe my experience but that just doesn't make any sense. My family and I went to this restaurant during national cheesecake day and we were extremely fortunate to find open seating. And even better we arrived during happy hour and were able to feast on some delicious appetizers that had a decent discount! My dad and I got the Cajun pasta with shrimp and chicken and even though my dad made the horrible mistake to have broccoli instead of pasta we both enjoyed the dish greatly! I can't help but recommend the Tex mex egg rolls which were also quite a delight. The service was great making this a great time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=40,2.88,3.08,3.176,2.6079999999999997,3.0000000000000004

276,Nawal A.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-05,"I am writing this regarding the appalling service me and my husband received yesterday evening at Cheesecake factory in Arlington.  First and foremost I would like to say that I went there on july 25th for my birthday meal and the food wasn't up to standard. The fries were cold and tasted like they had been sitting there for a while. The crispy catfish wasn't so crispy and was wet on some sides. I understand that some of your produce maybe frozen but on that particular day I could really taste it. I decided to give it a blind eye and reassure myself that every business has its bad days.  However, 30th July we went back to the same location as it was my husband's birthday on the 27th and I thought I'd treat him to a belated meal. We approached the hosting desk where we were reassured that there was a table outside that just needed to be cleared and we would be seated in the next 10 minutes. As I am heavily pregnant I left my husband inside and went outside to get some fresh air where I saw the table being cleared. A few minutes later I see a group of people being seated on thay exact table. Therefore I went back in straight to bring it to their attention, my husband had informed me that the hostess that had promised us the table had brought it to the other hostesses attention but she decided to disregard those instructions.  I do have the hostess's name and wish not to disclose it for the time being as I am not someone that wishes to see her face severe punishment. Nevertheless I want to bring it to your attention that the way in which she dealt with it was utterly unprofessional. She insisted to argue that the other table were first regardless of the fact that her colleague reassured her we arrived first.  I am heavily pregnant, and you would think out of good customer service and goodwill she would have solved the situation in better manner. The manager wanted to compensate the situation with a dessert but seeing that neither I or my husband like sweet things he stated that was the best he could do.  All in all my experience in cheesecake factory twice in the same week wasn't very pleasant. I would suggest that the hosting team to be more precise and deal with such situations in a better manner.  I hope to hear back from customer service team",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=40,2.8,3.05,3.164,,2.9499999999999997

I come to the Cheesecake Factory once a year, for National Cheesecake day.  For $3.89, I get a nice slice of cheesecake, and I get to hang out with a friend.  This year, I went with one of my favorites, the fresh banana cream.  It's less sweet than most cheesecakes, and it has fruit so it's healthy, right?  I also grabbed a small plate to munch on, and it was the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks ($6).  It was a very rich grilled cheese cut up into four sticks, and it was good too.  Due to the richness, I would recommend splitting it, which we found to be perfect. Our server was abrupt, but I made it clear that we were just there for cheesecake.  I didn't want him to waste his time, but a little service is always nice.

I'm thin, but big guy and I'm hungry all the time, so it's awesome finding a restaurant with big portions. Additionally, it offers a lighter/healthier menu items that my girlfriend likes so when we aren't sure what to eat this place is always on the list for its variety. Service overall it's okay, sometimes better than others like you can expect anywhere, but overall I'm happy with it. They tend to bring the water quickly and check on you a couple of times throughout the meals. However, the only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because of their desserts... With that name I expected them to have great cakes, especially cheesecakes! Unfortunately, all the cakes I've tried (chocolate, red velvet and cheesecake) had too much of an artificial flavor for me :(.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=40,2.84,3.04,3.18,,2.9600000000000004
3,Sarah M.,"Washington, DC",23,76,64.0,3.0,2017-08-25,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory's over the years.  But this is the only one that didn't have a wait on a Friday night at 7pm for a table.  And now I know why - the front side of the house/service is a sloppy mess.   The food though is typical of Cheesecake Factory with a few subpar notes: the bread basket came out room temperature instead of warm like it should be.  The salad was over dressed.  And the edamame we ordered looked wilted and like it had been nuked in the microwave shortly before being brought to our table (something tells me that's exactly what happened).  Not the best food I've had from a Cheesecake Factory in other words, but not terrible. This location earned its three stars for the slow service (20 minutes to get a check after we'd asked for one for example).  But the worst part was they sat us at a dirty table that hadn't been wiped down from the last customers.  I asked to be seated someplace else as it was clearly and visibly dirty.  They didn't accommodate us despite many open tables (????!!!). Instead, after standing around for a while, the hostess got a paper towel and did a half-hearted job smearing around crumbs and chocolate on the seats and then walking off without a word.  I spent the next five minutes cleaning the table myself with a napkin.  So after cleaning my own table I then got to pay $20 for a tuna salad.  Something about that felt deeply, deeply wrong.   Bottom line, there are so many places to eat in Clarendon, and I love Cheesecake Factory in general, but this location is not up to par.  I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington,2.8,3.03,3.18,,2.9379999999999997

2,Matthew S.,"Clearwater Beach, FL",0,30,3.0,2.0,2017-09-17,"Oh! How the mighty have fallen. When Cheesecake Factory first started,  it was a unique and mildly exotic dining experience,  with a diverse and eclectic menu.  Along the way,  they over expanded and have lost quality control.  The items are exotic if not slightly overpriced,  but they don't deliver like they previously did. In the last month, I have eaten (dine is too charitable ) at 2 CF locations. One had poor service and ridiculously undersized portions. But this location took the cheesecake!  We ordered a hamburger,  that in a previous life, had been the sole of a shoe.   The accompanying fries were cold.   Our salads were ok, ok being the highlight of the experience.  The waitress disappeared,  did not check on the progress of our meal, and when she did return ro begin clearing the table,  we were treated to an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke.  Disgusting!  We paid the tab, but before we left, I had one more entertaining experience.  The men's room was filthy,  floor and other surfaces, details omitted in the interest of good taste. I told the manager who shrugged,  so I  added that even gas stations laugh at this place.  It all bespeaks a lack if attention to the details that enhance a dining experience.  Since Cheesecake Factory is 0 for 2 at two separate locations,  I can only conclude that their expansion has outpaced their commitment to quality.  The experience is no longer new, and if it doesn't remain consistent,  maybe it is time to move on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington,2.84,2.99,3.16,,2.9299999999999997

My dining partners were 3/4 way done by the time my food came. This is with the manager on notice. Maybe it wasn't put in? Maybe the runners made a mistake? I'll never know.

My main course Evelyn's pasta had very very little sauce, the pasta wasn't fully cooked & tasted like it was under a heating lamp after waiting to be served.
