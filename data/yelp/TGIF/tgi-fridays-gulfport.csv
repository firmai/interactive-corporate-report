Wynter R.,"Moss Point, MS",40,7,5,1.0,3/19/2014,"The one and only nice thing I have to say about my lunch experience with my husband today was that we were seated promptly by the hostess. It was downhill from there. When drink orders were brought to the table the waitress Jessica sloshed tea all over both myself and the table.  Rather than apologise and clean it up she just stares at it like it just magically appeared all over the place. She then just looked away and walked off. I cleaned it up myself. Next when the food arrived I noticed that the au jus for my French dip looked funny. That would be because it was French onion soup so thick that it would't even pour out of the ramekin. When I asked I was told this is how it is served. Since I don't like French onion soup, and the sandwich was to dry to eat otherwise I gave it to my husband and decided to just eat my salad. Bad Idea. I mixed up my salad and took a bite. I was greeted with absolute nastiness. Rather than a normal salad some one had grabbed a Caesar salad complete with dressing and poured my blue cheese dressing on top. It was bad. When I called over the waitress and showed her she said and I quote  "" Well what do you want, a fresh salad?""  It was at this point that I had to remind myself that I am an adult and yelling on public is childish. I simply told her yes. When the  salad came out she just set it on the table and walked off. The hostess then spills her drink right next to the hostess station (right next to our table) and rather than mop it up unrolls an entire roll of paper towels on top of it. I was surprised at the level of apathy and sheer laziness of the front of house staff. It is time for one of two things Friday's,  retrain your staff or cull the heard. Either way we will not be back for quite a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=40
Philip M.,"Long Beach, MS",0,5,,2.0,1/25/2012,"I've been eating here for eight years, and have noticed a rapid decline in food quality. Friday's seems to be cutting a few corners , possibly to parallel the economy. I ordered a pasta dish last week. Service was excellent, but bread sticks with pasta is now completely unheard of at TGIF's. Won't be eating there again for a while. Chili's is right next door..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=40
tonya b.,"Altadena, CA",24,134,9,3.0,3/22/2007,"3 stars because i had great service and was seated quickly- i had a very good experience in spite of the fact i really despise these types of restaurants. And i was surprised at the menu. The new menu @ Friday's boasts healthy choices of not-so-man-sized portions. I ordered a chicken dish from the new ""right size, right price"" menu, and I was pleasantly surprised that brown rice was offered. AND you only get one chicken breast, not two. The plate was small, and not overflowing with garbage, such as FRIED GREEN BEANS! (Seriously, how stupid are we?).  All menu items on the healthy menu have approximately 10g fat and 500 calories. Wow is all i can say. How perfect! Plus I left having barely spent $10 for the entire meal. I almost gave 2 stars because there is still smoking inside this restaurant, but it's Mississippi, so what can you do. DRAGONFIRE CHICKEN  Marinated chicken breast topped with fiery Kung Pow sauce, mandarin oranges and pineapple pico de gallo.  Served with stir-fried brown rice and cilantro lime seasoned broccoli.  The quality of the food is, of course, mediocre at best, but when you are in Gulfport, Mississippi, your choices are very limited, since half the buildings are being destroyed, many signs are still blown out, and blown over, and Katrina's effect can well be seen even today. It was a depressing night's stay in Gulfport, and I have a new appreciation for the devastation and the continuos press we see on the area and its lack of progress after the storm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport?start=40

Jen T.,"Gulfport, MS",134,273,487,2.0,7/7/2016,I am not a TGIF regular. I think I have been once in California. Met a girlfriend for drinks/dinner. It was 6:15 when I arrived and it wasn't busy at all. That always worries me lol but I went in and from the beginning everyone was really nice. My friend was already there waiting and I was greeted almost immediately by our server. We started with the tostada app ($11) and we waited to order our entree for a little while. As we chatted we did enjoy the tostadas but I thought there was minimal chicken and too much sauce. It's basically three tostada shells halved and topped. I think is was good just needed to be beefed up a bit. Could be a great entree if it had more stuff on it. So I ended up ordering the Mahi Mahi sandwich and let's just get right to it. It was not good. It looked amazing on the menu- I will include my sandwich and a menu sandwich picture. My fish was very fishy (gross) and the flavor in the bread were just icky. It also came on pita bread?? I hate pita bread. It was called naan bread and I don't know what that is but I really just can't say one thing good about the whole entree. My fries came out in a paper bag and were not fresh so they went back. The manager was so friendly and I appreciate it. Once I sent the fries back and bit into the fish I decided I wasn't going to flag him down again. I was visiting an old friend from work and just wanted to have a nice visit.  I more then likely won't be back but I do appreciate the good service.  *****just look at my sandwich and compare it to the menu picture******* WOW!!!!!  My recommendation- skip the fish.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport

Roger E.,"Lake Charles, LA",4,213,1,2.0,4/24/2017,"I should have checked out Yelp before we went there. Sorry Yelp. We walked in and the hostess asked if we could sit in the bar section since they were beginning their rotation. Didn't have the slightest idea what she was talking about and we don't like sitting near the bar but went ahead and did it so they could rotate. I ordered the burger, medium. The waitress alerted me that sometimes it's too rare for most prople and should it be cooked well. I asked her if it was premium beef and she said yes. It also asked if it was pink inside and she said yes so I went with it. Well low and behold she brought the burger and at the first bite I thought I heard it moo. If I had a bandaid I could have saved it's life.  My wife ordered a strawberry salad with grilled chicken and ranch dressing. After I finished killing the burger the salad came out late. She told the server that she ordered her dressing, ranch, on the side. Her salad came with vinegarette already on the salad and no ranch. She took it back and told us that someone else had taken her salad and they would have to make another. After finishing my cow her salad came and she discovered that there were no pecans in it. Again the alert went out and the pecans delivered with the excuse that the salad maker was new. The mamager came by and I told him about the issues which he apologized for. All in all our experience sucked. We were on our way to Pensecola and stopped there for lunch. I will make a note to make sure we don't ever stop again. I gave them 2 stars because there were a number of military eating there and I think they gave them a discount.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-gulfport

Nick W.,"Lafayette, LA",0,6,7,2.0,9/1/2015,"Tried eating out here around 11 at night, food wasn't anything special. Ordered the hibachi chicken skewers with hibachi chicken and broccoli. The chicken was cooked poorly (was dry and smothered in barbecue sauce) the skewers had no vegetables on them at all though, broccoli was steamed, no seasoning or anything so was pretty bland IMO, the jasmine rice was probably my favorite part of the meal. Oh and my pita bread was actually burnt on the underside. Ordered a Kamikaze to drink (vodka, triple sec, lime juice) but had way too much lime to really enjoy it. The service was poor. I sat at the bar but the bartender only came around twice in my time (took my order and gave a drink refil) I had to keep tapping the shoulders of other waitress' passing to get help for salt or a refill of coke or anything else that being said, all the waitress' were extremely friendly, this bothered me the most I think as a Bartender myself.

The website was easy enough and I was able to pay online so that was one less thing to worry about. I made sure to order so that I would get to the restaurant as my food would have been ready. I get here and not only is my food not ready, they haven't even started cooking it yet. The bartender that was helping me got my name and walked back to the kitchen for ten minutes without sending anyone to notify me of a wait time or that the order was taking longer than usual.

Jason W.,"Omaha, NE",5,55,,1.0,12/22/2014,"Never again. The co-workers decided on Fridays.  I tried the turkey sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was tiny.  I mean, comparable to a simple McDonald's hamburger bun.  The turkey - well, I've had more food caught in my beard after drunken stops at Waffle House.  Seriously, it was smaller than a single piece of folded pre-packaged sliced turkey you'd find at your local grocery store.  The fries were cold and soggy.  I didn't get my side of potato soup that was ordered with the meal. Nobody here (~12 people) was happy with the food.  One co-worker took a spoonful of her broccoli soup and immediately threw the entire container in the trash, saying it tasted rotten and like plastic. On top of all of that nonsense, the price was quite high, even for normal portions, but considering how tiny the portions were, we were quite surprised.

We didn't order any well done steaks or anything that would take a while to fix. Which I would have understood if it was at a prime time that we went in, like Friday night dinner rush, or we ordered 4 well done steaks, but it wasn't, and we didn't. All we ordered was soup/salad, kids pasta, and two endless apps. Easy peasy. But for some reason it all took an insane amount of time. We went in late, probably close to 9:30. Maybe the kitchen had cut a lot of their cooks. Who knows. I had asked for my soup out before the rest of the food, which it didn't come out first, and when it was brought out it was cold. I didn't say anything because we had waited a good 25-30 min for everything and was just ready to eat and leave at that point. Don't know if we'll be back.

They were ok, all tasted about the same. Not sure if it's just at this location or something new tgi's is doing, but we got a free app of chips and salsa for being stripes members! Ordered spicy chicken sliders and basket of fries to split between the two of us. Sliders were soooooo spicy we were unable to eat them so ordered the jack sampler app instead. By the time it arrived we were pretty full from the fries, so boxed it up to take home. Overall the hostess was definitely the shining star! Service was good. Food and drinks were good. Btw....

I got the Strawberry Fields salad. To begin with, it was pitifully small for an almost $9 salad. Then there's the dressing. The salad was literally swimming in it. There had to have been 1/2-3/4 of a cup of dressing on this salad. Even though I considered the salad small, I just couldn't finish it dressed like it was.

The updated menu is a little overwhelming--so I am glad they had a lunch menu. Although smaller, it still provided plenty of options. My husband ordered a burger and parmesan fries and I did the pick 2 with bruschetta and soup. The soup and fries were great. The bruschetta was soft--which was weird since I expect crunchy/toasted bread with that and they piled the tomatoes on a bit too much. My husband liked his burger, but it didn't seem like anything special. It was decent food, but nothing great or special. The lunch prices are good though--I don't think we would eat here for dinner.

She returned with our change and walk off. We looked at each other and said in unison ""where is the bill?"" We had to flag her down again -we said we want a copy of the bill for our records.

The food was in such small portions a child could have finished it within minutes. My husband's steak, we ordered medium, came out burned, overcooked and dry as could be. The ""lobster sauce"" I ordered on the side contained 6 little tails which resembled crawfish ,green peppers and gunk held it together.
