If you eat in and get a burger you can get some fries to start off instead of blowing $$$ on an app, get some interesting dipping sauce while you're at it.  The restaurant area is SUPER noisy, there's nothing to block the sound from other people and if it's crowded you're basically shouting at the other people you sit with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=60,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

My fiancee and I stopped by for dinner, we found a small spider in his appetizer (hot wings) to start off with, I don't have an issue with spiders, except when they end up on my plate. Told our waiter and let it go, the food took longer then anticipated, but we were enjoying the Nats game so not a big deal. My fiancees burger came out lukewarm, but he was hungry at this point and just started eating. Then the manager came over, apologized by saying they've never had a bug problem before and they do a weekly cleanliness inspection ( I think maybe an outside inspector is in order?) and offered dessert, we declined. He told us the app would be taken off the bill. My meal was the veggies and hummus appetizer, it looked good until I picked up a zucchini slice and found a hair stuck on it. As the manager was right there I pointed this little extra he was surprised and apologized again.  That was it for me, I had lost my appetite.

116,Vicky C.,"Leesburg, VA",186,278,10.0,3.0,2013-02-14,"So it's Valentines Day which means we were at Red Robin tonight.  Might sound odd, but my son - who turned 7 today - was talked out of going to Chuck E Cheese or Pizza Go Round for his birthday dinner and opted for someplace ""fancy"" this year - Red Robin.  And there you have it.   I had the salad, it was good. The honey mustard is the bomb. The adults all seemed to be satisfied with the food.  My son, however, complained about the Grilled Cheese being ""sour"" (I tasted it - it's sort of bland, definitely made me look like a gourmet comparatively).  So we had to re-order.  He was satisfied with the chicken strips meal but they did not offer to remove the grilled cheese from our bill - and considering there were 4 adults and 2 kids, I thought they should have.  My daughter ordered an appetizer of ribs but she found them spicy, so my adult son and husband split them and we ordered her a burger which made her content. The service was good.  Everyone was friendly.  It's clean.  It's priced reasonably.   I miss the ""Mixology"" drinks they used to have (non-alcoholic and very fun mixed drinks).  Kids loved them but I am guessing they're off the menu because they were pricey and if every family is like mine, we simply didn't let the kids order the ""expensive"" drinks very often. Listen, compared to Chuck E Cheese or Pizza Go Round this was a big score.  In the end everyone was happy and no one had a headache. Oh - and my son was too full to eat much of his ""FREE"" Birthday Sunday although he definitely enjoyed receiving it. PS - if you are thinking that Valentines Day is a cool birthday, think again... well, if you're the mom.  The day after he was born it hit me:  I will never have another Valentines Day again.  Seven years later I can attest that it's true.  But it's worth it... when you tell my Devon that he is sweet he always says ""I was born on Valentines Day, what did you expect?""  My little Cupid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.508,3.1600000000000006

The issue? It's overly loud due to kids screaming, crying and vying for attention (Parents: NO! STOP! BAD!). I don't want to drop stars on a restaurant because of this, but I find it makes it REALLY hard to enjoy coming here. It's been pretty consistent every single time I've been here, and this makes me a sad panda. The food is great, reliable and pretty tasty. Red Robin's grub is above average for burgers, and I'm a definite fan of the Royal Red (with a fried egg!) and the Chili ""I will wear this on my shirt with shame"" Chili burger. Burger-wise, I don't necessarily think they Red Robin holds a candle to their competition (a certain restaurant involving a quintet of gentlemen). It's pretty good though, so no real complaints on that end. All in all, it's a decent place for a burger (if you can stand the potential screaming/yelling kids).

But this one and the whole experience was just horrible. Before you ask why I went, well, it wasn't my choice. Was there with family who has kids. Of course, the kids always order cheese pizza so why the $%!@ we don't go to a pizza place instead of a subpar burger joint is beyond me. So what was especially horrendous about this RR? For starters, it's a special kind of deafening. Forget the wide open echo chamber of brats who sound like they're in the deepest levels of the underworld's torture chambers. The booth setup had us right with our backs to the bar, and the damn phone at the bar was ringing VERY loud the entire time, and no one would answer it. The server, he was very bad at his job and the most annoying person I've probably ever met to boot. He whined about not getting enough sleep. He tried out his standup comedy routine that wasn't funny at all. He asked awkward questions. And he screwed up orders, forgot things that people asked for, you name it. Guy really needs to try something else... like maybe the mental hospital. And then there's the food. RR is usually not great anyway. It touts itself as a burger joint but I can rarely bring myself to order them because they're so bad. Like little frozen patty pucks. (Seriously, there are several Five Guys' within a few miles, GO GET A REAL BURGER IF YOU WANT A BURGER, YO.) So then I'm led to try one of the non-burger items on the menu, which is probably asking too much of a burger joint but hey, THEY PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Blech. The food was bad, though. I didn't find one thing on the menu that I wanted. I used to order the nachos here as an entree, but they took those off the menu (much like they replaced the unlimited mediocre fry baskets with tiny little fry cones not too long ago). I settled on ""Clucks and Riblets."" The 'clucks' were OK -- your standard deep-fried breaded chicken strips you can get anywhere. The riblets, however, were disgusting. You know how baby back ribs look after you finish eating the meat off them? Break one bone in half with its tiny pieces of meat remnant left on it, and you have yourself one of RR's riblets. They were dry, hell, they didn't even bother putting the barbecue sauce drizzle on all of them, but the meat was tough, dry and required a microscope to locate. Everyone who got a burger had a cold burger. The patties were cooked through, but they must've been sitting out for a LONG time. Which makes sense, because it took a long time to get our food. Start to finish, dinner took almost two hours. Oh yeah, and that fruit salad. I'll post a pic of it. I just had to take one because it was so disgusting that no one at the table who got that as a side would even touch it. It looks like the apple slices might have been done in the same day, but the other fruits *definitely* came from a can filled with high fructose corn syrup. Just a big soupy, mushy, overly sweet mess. PUKE. RR is loud. It's annoying. The service sucks. The food sucks. It has an identity crisis somewhere between a kiddie cartoon episode and a boozy R-rated film. Where else can you watch Boomerang, play with a man in a giant bird mascot suit, eat a kids meal and get wasted? STAY AWAY.

My mistake! The Chicken Cesar wrap had too much dressing inside. The fries were fresh when we got them but turned stale really quick. They were not seasoned, not even salted, which is fine by me. I liked the fried Cod. I received 4 pieces that were fried well except for one piece that was a bit raw. The tarter sauce was delicious even though it was served at room temperature. That wasn't the worst though.   The worse aspect of all the food was the French onion soup! Not only did they forget packing the focaccia bread it comes with, but this bowl of Red Robbins French onion soup was the worst tasting French onion soup I ever had in my life! All it was was a nasty bowl of bland beef broth with added water. It had no flavor! It was disgusting! I thought they forgot the onions until I noticed they were sunken at the bottom. I had to stir the soup to see the onions. The 'cheese' was a small mass of bubble gum lost in the murky water of the broth. It was awful. The whole thing was extremely watery that it was splishing and splashing in the container the whole way home. After a couple spoons, I just poured it down the sink. I could've easily flushed it down the toilet, too, because it was basically just water.  I don't know how this place stays in business. In the least, it should be a fast food restaurant and not a sit-down establishment. I can't believe they actually have waiters serving this crap.

Our appetizer came out within 10 minutes of ordering. We finished our appetizer and proceeded to wait about 35 minutes before we had a manager come over and tell us that their ticket system in the kitchen didn't get our order in and that our burgers were just now being cooked. About 15 minutes later our food came out about 12:50. Meanwhile, every single table around us received their food on time (even those who came in 15-20 minutes behind us and ended up finishing before we even received our food). Clearly there was no problem with their ticket system for all of the other customers seated around us. And clearly there was no issue with our appetizer (which was on the same ticket as our order) coming out on time. It was obvious our order just wasn't put in. Otherwise the kitchen would have been backed up on everyone's order, not just ours. Once we received our food, we had to ask for sides that we had requested when we placed the order and waited for those to come out. The food itself was extremely average. Not great. When we got our bill we got the ""manager special"" which was $2.00 off of our total bill of $35.

Why is there a wait when the restaurant is half empty? I'll tell ya why, because the place is just going down hill.   There must be management change or policy change that was put into effect and its chased any Server with a brain or half a mind to run far away.

The atmosphere was live and active and with tons of unique pictures and posters to make you look around to see what's on them. I especially did this too. The service was great too.  Until I went here just recently. When I saw the outside, I saw that there had been a remodeling of the outside. The logo had been changed and the whole building's color was a dark red. Just dark red. (I thought ""how can people see this place at night when the sign lights are out"") then when I went inside, I was shocked in HORROR of what the remodels were: 1. The front lobby: the arcade was taken out, the seating was the same, and there is this 20' tall chalkboard that takes up 1/4 of the tiny corner wall. I waited about 15-20 minutes, not a waiting time to complain about too much (yet?) 2. The seating area: about 97% of the pictures were GONE. The seats were the same though. I felt like the place was ginormous instead of small because of all of the stuff that was taken out of there. The atmosphere was bland and empty. So when I got seated I ordered my drink, and it took FOREVER. If it takes 10-15 minutes to get a drink, then there is a (small) problem. While I were waiting, still about the drink, there were other waited asking me if I had been served yet. Then my drink came finally. Our waiter apologize for the long wait. Then I ordered our food and we waited for triple the time I waited for my drink. I only got checked on about once in the 9 years I waited for food. Also, I hadn't got silverware yet, and guess what? There was no silverware! So I had to wait about 5 minutes for silverware to be washed and be given to me.  Eventually I got my food. Again the waiter apologized and left. The food (as always) was delicious. Why couldn't I get food faster if it was this food? After I ate my food I waited another 5 years for my waiter to come. I got my bill and put the money in there. Then the waiter took the money without a smile nor thank you nor ""do you need change?"" Our waiter didn't return after that. And so I left, with me being disappointed with my experience. The verdict: I was sorely disappointed with my experience. The food and drinks were delicious. The service was iffy and the waiting times were ridiculous.

60,Julie S.,"Northern, VA",1,73,,3.0,2015-06-11,"3 stars overall ONLY because the food was and is really good and managed to salvage an otherwise crappy dinner experience...  My review is from a visit about 3 weeks ago which I neglected to fully finish/post. 1) 2 adults for dinner on a thurs night and they automatically seat us in the bar at a high table in an already crowded bar area that is so loud I can't hear my husband across the table.  We are seated right next to a lower table of 3 people that one guy is talking so loudly to his tablemates it is as if we are in their conversations because I didn't miss a word about his entire company and the testing going on as well as prepartions for exams and such and expected results.  His tablemates had smaller voices so I only heard half their responses. 2) Waitress took a crazy long time to come by and greet us, so long that we were ready to order our food when she also took our drink order. 3) Some other person came by while going to another table and dropped off a plate with napkins, forks, knives on it on our table.  No talking to us/no greeting, just placed it on the table as he walked by.  (Kind of weird.) 4) Our food shows up and it's good.  Price point of a $10.00 burger with unlimited fries is ok with me. ( I guess I am cheap and don't think a $14-$15 burger is going to be worth the extra dough though and stear clear of those.)  Unfortunately, waitress didn't come back to check on us for a long time (we were both almost done) and drinks had been drained for a good long time and hubs wanted refills on the unlimited broccoli - he's so healthy.  It took forever for the server to return and ask about those as I said before we were both practically done with our meal and our sides were long finished.  We still ordered them and it took a long time for the refills to arrive.  All in all, the food salvaged the rating, the setting was horrible (too loud in bar area), the food was good, the service needs some serious work.  Greet your customers in a reasonable amount of time and don't forget to check in on them about refills and to ensure everything is ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=80,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.0920000000000005,2.72

45,Sam M.,"Bristow, VA",6,13,4.0,1.0,2015-12-20,"Was here yesterday before Christmas shopping at the mall. We arrived early around 11:30am to a virtually empty dining area that had the AC blasting-it was about 40 degrees outside. Things started off promising as our tower of onion rings arrived piping hot and delicious. BUT from there, it went downhill quickly. The waiter kept referring to my grandson as ""the kid"" which I know doesn't seem offensive, but somehow it just came across that way. ""Let me repeat your order, blah, blah...and for the kid..."" Maybe it's just me.  After the drinks arrived, the onion rings were shortly after. My 3yr old grandson had inhaled his chocolate milk, so we ordered another for him. Our ice teas were nearing empty when it was delivered, but we were never asked for refills. After about 10 minutes we hailed someone down to ask for a refill and then our waiter brought over unsweetened tea. When they brought the food...an hour later... It was cold and my grandson got french fries instead of apples. We hailed the same guy over and it turns out he's the manager. He brought the apples and a replacement burger for me.  Finally, they have placed a little kiosk machine on the table to play a trivia game and my wife was exploring it but stopped when it wanted money to play. When reviewing the bill, I mentioned the ""entertainment"" charge and he said, ""oh yeah, these things have been doing that when it shouldn't, did you want me to take it off your bill?"" I said, so you knew about this and didn't say anything? I suggest you let your customers know in advance and you should check the bill beforehand! He said, ""Oh, good idea."" Wow!

101,Nora H.,"Leesburg, VA",0,5,4.0,1.0,2015-12-23,"My husband and I was shopping yesterday and decided we didn't want to eat in the food court but rather somewhere outside of the mall. I should have read the reviews more carefully beforehand because this was a HUGE MISTAKE. We came in around 5:30 PM and they were not busy. There were also a lot of waiters and waitresses on duty during that time as well.  After being seated we waited for a while. I told my husband that if we don't get serve in the next 5 minutes I want to leave. He said it will be okay. We even try to call out one of the hostess but she didn't hear us I guess. Then after about maybe 15 mins of waiting a white couple was seated in the same section as us. Thus, I wanted to do a little experiment to see if they get served before us. Then I went to the bathroom and came back out and behold the other couple who sat down for just 5 minutes had a server asking them what they wanted to drink. While we have already waited for a little bit over 20 minutes now. That was the last straw and we left. I would have given them a zero star if yelp had that option.  Also, I have eaten at other at Red Robin before but never have the service been this appalling. Guess the service is consistently horrible considering the other reviews as well.  Maybe if the waiters, waitresses, and hostess wasn't flirting with each other they would have been able to do their jobs.

This experience was one disappointment after another. Not greeted at the bar for 5 minutes, our beers were flat. Got one from one keg and another from the new keg, but am convinced the second was just the pitcher of the dregs after a foam out. Onion rings took 20 minutes, and it was not busy at all. I ordered a cod fish sandwich (yes I should have ordered a burger but my husband wanted red Robin and it's Lent!) and they brought out fish and chips that were fried to a crisp. Seriously all breading burnt and inedible. Hubby ordered a burger and garlic fries, but got regular fries only.  Look in the end I am not an avid yelper and sometimes things happen. But the employees were congregating at the bar and in a booth nearby, there were dirty glasses all over the bar next to us, and while waiting for the check we couldn't find anyone to flag down.  This restaurant needs a manager that takes pride in customer service and understands that at red Robin, the food is not the draw. It's about making sure the mediocre food is presented with a smile and attentive service. In many cases we have found this to be the case. Tonight the service at the bar was a joke.

My first impression was the bartender, Jon I believe was his name, whom I could tell really didn't want to be there that night. He was very impersonable, and acted overwhelmed although there was really very little going on. The bar area seemed to be the place for the wait staff to come hang out while they weren't working the floor and talk about their customers which I found very unprofessional. I ordered a salad as an appetizer and a burger. It seemed like at least ten minutes before my salad arrived, followed 3 minutes later by my burger so as I'm trying to finish my salad the burger and fries are getting chilled by the vent above me.

37,Citizen P.,"Reston, VA",0,18,22.0,4.0,2016-10-19,"We have been fans of Red Robin for more than 20 years. When we lived in CA it was a favorite spot in the mall for my daughter and her friends. We went as a family and when we lived in MI, we went often. We now live in VA and still go to Red Robin. We've also been to locations in other states. I will confess and say that the bottomless fries is one of the main reasons we are dedicated to Red Robin. Of course we love the burgers and food, plus the free lemonade refills!   Our most recent visit was pleasant because our waiter, Andrew, was very attentive. He was friendly and helpful, but not intrusive and annoying. It was near closing time, but he was still enthusiastic and attentive. He made our dining experience pleasurable. I had my laptop and needed to submit something online before midnight. I must say that I am disappointed that Red Robin still does not have wi-fi. Maybe Red Robin's CEO is thinking that if they provided free wi-fi, bottomless fries, and free refills on lemonade, they would probably have to evict patrons. I'm sure I could sit there for hours. :-) I love the bill-paying machine they have on the table. This eliminates the need for a waiter to take your credit card out of your sight. I really prefer patronizing restaurants that allow you to pay at the table or pay at the register. Again, this decreases the chance of dishonest servers  stealing your credit card information. I wish other restaurants would adopt Red Robin's pay at the table system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles,2.28,2.71,2.71,,2.5380000000000003

But seriously, the food was bland and terribly prepared. The burger was completely flavorless and topped with a hard, white tomato and shredded lettuce from a bag, the first order of steamed broccoli was brown and limp, the second order was rubbery (wtf?), the sweet potato fries came out cold, and the follow-up steak fries were undercooked, and some were nearly raw. Literally every food item was bottom of the barrel slop. Honestly I'm embarrassed to have even eaten here (and I gave a taco bell five stars!). I had some memory from 5+ years ago of liking this place, but this is disgusting, low quality mush for children or people with the palate of children. I don't know if the quality has decreased or if we caught them on an off night, but there is no way I'm coming back to find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles,2.24,2.69,2.69,,2.5100000000000002
54,Sarah L.,"Ashburn, VA",2,14,,2.0,2016-12-18,"My family and I used to love Red Robin.  Their burgers were always big and juicy and delicious, the unlimited fries were great, and the food was always piping hot.  However, the last several times (at least 5) that I've been here I've been beyond disappointed.  The burger sizes and quality have very noticeably gone down while the price has miraculously gone way up.  WTF?...  The food has been less than hot when we've ordered lately.  And the ""bottomless"" fries are hardly bottomless anymore.  You get about 10 fries (seriously) to start and whenever I have asked for more lately they always take forever, to where I'm almost done with my meal when they arrive, OR I've had them not come at all.  The service has been extremely lacking as well.  The servers I've had seem to not care, hardly ever come by for drink or fry refills, and aren't very engaging in general.  $15 for a burger, ""bottomless"" fries now (they used to be $9/$10) and crappy service??  Are you kidding me?  I definitely will not be back - way better legit burger joints in the area that pride themselves on their quality and service and don't try to ream you out of $15 for pathetic food and service.  Bye bye, Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=40,2.24,2.66,2.66,,2.492
34,Matthew F.,"Sterling, VA",6,3,,1.0,2016-12-20,"This Red Robin location is just terrible, there is simply no other way to rate my experience there on 12/19.  I would give it zero stars if possible.   I have been to other Red Robin locations around the country and have always enjoyed the food and service.  Big juicy burgers, and prompt friendly waitstaff.  This location was anything but that.   We walked in around 830 in the evening and took a seat in the bar area, which had 2-3 other tables occupied, other than that the restaurant was pretty empty.  I ordered a beer and my girlfriend ordered a Citron and water.  At the same time we ordered chips and guacamole.  The first thing that struck me as odd, was the bartender/server telling us that ordering a vodka/water was wierd.  I tended bar and waited tables to put myself through college and this is a pretty common order,  but okay, maybe he was new, whatever.  I told him him it was a pretty common cocktail, and he looked like he took offense, even though I said it really casually just to make conversation.  Anyways, he gets our drinks and comes back a few minutes later to take our entree order.  We both ordered the exact same burger (Blue Ribbon) except one had a salad substituted for fries.  The server of course didn't write anything down, which is fine it was an easy order.  Also, he kept trying to get my girlfriend to order one of the ""specialty"" cocktails even though she clearly stated what she wanted.  She had to tell him no 3 times before he relented.  Seriously? We had been sitting there for awhile and we needed another round of drinks, we tried to get the attention of the server numerous times as he went to other tables in the bar, but no luck.  He never came back and asked us how drinks were, checked if appetizer had arrived,  or if we wanted another round.  He was basically hanging out in a booth on the other side of the restaurant the entire time.  There were no employees in the bar area, not one.   By this time we had been seated  for close to an hour, have only been served one drink, not asked if we would like another round, and our chips and guacamole appetizer never came out to the table. I finally went to the booth where all the employees were hanging out and asked for our server.  A minute later the server came over to our table with two crusty dried out burgers, and said ""Sorry, our broiler was turned off"".  The burgers were not made the way we ordered them, and one had no toppings on it at all. WTF?  On top of this he didn't ask if we wanted more drinks, and our glasses were clearly empty.  And he never questioned the absence of our appetizer.  I might add that in this amount of time, a table that came in after us, ordered and had eaten their ENTIRE meal.   At this point I just told him we didn't want the food or another round, we would just pay for our drinks.  A manager came over and tried to make it right, but it was pretty unprofessional, he just said sorry repeatedly and insisted we take the food home in take out containers even though we didn't want it.  I told him we didnt want the food and why, but he still brought boxes to the table.  The food just looked really unappealing (wilted lettuce in my GF salad, dried out crusty buns, cold fries), and wasn't prepared the way we wanted it.  Not only that, the manager looked and acted like he was high as a kite. This server/bartender was just 100% not interested in doing his job.  That's all there is to it.  He had 3 other tables to take care of, and could not manage to get a really simple order to the kitchen.  We would have had atleast 2-3 drinks apiece had we been asked.  Isn't that the point of a restaurant, to sell drinks and food?    Clearly, the server forgot to put our order in TWICE.  Clearly this restaurant is mismanaged.    So, long story short, we waited an hour for two drinks, two jacked up disgusting burgers, and a pretty unprofessional response to the situation from the manager on duty I don't know the server/bartender's name because he never told us, but he had glasses, had his a hair in a hipster ponytail, and had an attitude problem. If any managing partner reads these reviews, I would appreciate a response because my opinion of Red Robin was drastically changed in a one hour experience.  I have dined at Red Robin for years in different parts of the country, and always enjoyed it, but probably won't ever go back after this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles,2.24,2.66,2.66,,2.492

Try and catch a special when you go and join the rewards club.  Much better than BGR. About the same as Five Guys, but that place is always raising prices. Lots of burger competition in the area now.  I agree with another review of this location - needs Wi-Fi. Update: As of 6/29/17 - still no wifi.

0,TJ S.,"Manassas, VA",0,1,,2.0,2016-12-23,Today I placed a to-go order for a plain smoke & pepper cheese burger to be cooked rare and asked to have A1 Peppercorn sauce added to the burger. The burger was overcooked and didn't have the A1 Peppercorn sauce. It did came with about 20 french fries that were soggy and cold. I think for a place that offers bottomless fries they could put a few more in with the to-go orders. I asked for a side of macaroni and cheese which was also ice cold. The piece of cheese that's put on top wasn't even melted. The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because the overcooked burger still had decent flavor for a burger well done. Needless to say this experience literally and figuratively left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't plan on visiting another Red Robin anytime soon if ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dulles?start=20,2.4,2.66,2.66,,2.556

The service was excellent and burgers are cooked to to your specifications. This establishment is also very clean with friendly service. I like how they have a $6.99 menu, which is economically friendly for families. I chose the BBQ burger and it was outstanding . Also the bottomless fries ensure that you never leave hungry. Our waitress made sure to keep them coming, as my boys and I kept filling the hole.  Both my boys ordered a milkshake for dessert and I can tell you by how fast it went down they were delicious. They also have plenty of other desserts to choose from. Overall a nice place for a family meal or group gathering.

23,Vito M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,4.0,3.0,2017-07-02,"So I'm dating this new Women GLENDA (Puerto Rican and gorgeous) we met on myspace. I think we are the only people who still who use that site. She's about half my age and has 4 kids and grandchildren and I got stuck taking them to Red Robin on our 2nd date. Christ on the cross help me  I can't remember all their names, as a matter of fact I called them all Charlie. So here I am trying to get the vibe going with GLENDA and these damn  kids keep screaming they're Hungary. I says to GLENDA where these kids from Somalia? So I figure I won't have to spend too much money making them order from the kid's menu. Well her Son in high school refuses to order from the kids menu and the damn Waiter doesn't seem keen on letting CHARLIE order from the Kid's menu. I tells the kid you're not 18 so you gotta order from the kid menu! I admit the kid has a beard but he aint 18 so he aint an adult.  Glenda whispers in my ear let him order from the regular menu and I give you dessert when we get back to my crib. So I say "" Okay Kid order from the Adult menu"", the damn plate was like 13 or 14 bucks and it came with those horrible steak fries. And they aint too generous with their lousy steak fries.  I asked the Waiter if they can get me real fries not steak fries since I aint eating a steak? He suggests ""Onion Rings"". So I think well ok that'll do but I don't want GLENDA to order any because I'm not going to kiss a dame with Onion breath.  So I goes to the John and do what a man has to do when the Taco Bell lunch didn't agree with him earlier.  So I comes out and Glenda and the kids, the grand kids are eating my pyramid of Onion Rings!!!!!!! Damn Greedy Bastards!  I get so mad, I says I'm gonna go in the car and get my phone. My order has arrived and I take my plate  to the car with me too. I get in the damn car and drive off. I left them at the Restaurant with the bill and no car.
