D S.,"Waller, TX",20,18,8,3.0,9/10/2017,"This place is always a fun atmosphere but last night it was disappointing when we opened up our silverware both mine and my friends and they had food stuck on it ,our waiter Daniel which was awesome, immediately looked embarrassed and replaced it for us and apologized.  the small things like this can ruin a place I suggest that the person that puts the silverware in the napkins please make sure and check  I don't think you want your family to use dirty utensils because if a child would have gotten those silverware they would have just used it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20
Erin P.,"Houston, TX",26,71,47,4.0,12/11/2016,"I have never had a bad meal at BJ's. They have many options to choose from on the menu and everyone should be able to find something to eat here. They used to have amazing pork chops, but they took them off the menu :(  The deep dish pizza is amazing and so is the clam chowder! I'm not a drinker but they do have a full bar with everything from beer to cocktails.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable and I generally enjoy my visit here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20
Anh L.,"Houston, TX",548,728,1541,1.0,5/3/2016,"Service here is always a hit-or-miss and so is the food. One day my dish would come out amazing and I would crave for it only to get something inedible, which is why I don't dine here anymore. I'd rather spend my money where the food and service is consistent. The last few times I went have all been really bad. The food is just not worth the price. Save your time and money and dine elsewhere. SHRIMP SCAMPI- shrimp tossed with delicate angel hair pasta in a light blend of olive oil, butter, garlic, lemon juice and roma tomatoes, topped with parmesan cheese, seasoned bread crumbs, and parsley The pasta is so soggy and clumped together that it was so hard to pick up pieces of it without the whole dish lifting into the air. It wasn't a light blend of olive oil.. more like drenched in oil, but ironically the pasta was bland and tasteless. I remember when it used to be so flavorful, but the past few times, it's been consistently bad and oily. The bread crumbs aren't even crispy. They soaked up the oil and so you'll be getting oil residue everywhere! What happened to the old BJ's? Food used to taste good around here. This is not cutting it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20

Joshua A.,"Cypress, TX",132,1,9,1.0,8/13/2017,I honestly went in here after a long day of work and I was looking to have a cold brew. But apparently due to the fact that I'm an illegal alien and the only reason I say this is because this was the only reason I gave them a Mexican passport and I was denied a drink.

Cecilia B.,"Houston, TX",1,17,3,3.0,6/18/2017,"We tried BJ's for the first time Friday evening. I ordered the potato skins for an appetizer, the broccoli/cheese soup in the bread bowl, and the prime rib and French fries for the main course. He had the spaghetti with meatballs. My potato skins were good, but they brought the soup out so soon after I really hardly had any; the same thing with the soup - although what I did have of the soup was delicious! My prime rib was very good and the fries were a perfect side. His spaghetti? Not so much....WHO PUTS JALAPEÑOS IN SPAGHETTI?? He was sick the remainder of the night...I also had the pazookie free dessert - monkey bread with ice cream. The monkey bread was to die for, but the ice cream tasted old. I would love to go back and try to eat there again, but I don't think he will be willing; with a few corrections (and no spaghetti), I think it could work out much better than the first time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20
Leah G.,"San Diego, CA",61,54,4,1.0,2/12/2017,"Since my 82 year old mom is not an active Yelper, I will act as her proxy.  This is a long review, so be forewarned.   My 82 year old mom and 7 of her 80+ year old friends from Sunday School decided to have their regular Sunday lunch at BJ's on 1960 today.  She was happy to tell me how kind the young gentleman was that waited on them, but how upset she was at the end of the meal.   The young waiter had allowed 4 of the elderly women to order off the children's menu.  Either they asked, or he offered, but none the less, he allowed them to order from that list.  Meal came, meal was enjoyed, and the bill came.  The bill was delivered by Sarah, the manager.  As she gave the bill to the women, she announced that from now on they could not come in there and order from the children's menu.  She first announced it from one end of the table, and just in case they missed it, she proceeded to the other end and REannounced it again.  Not only did the ladies hear it the first time, so did the other patrons in the crowded restaurant. (Some of which they knew from church) This not only embarrassed the ladies, but insulted them greatly.  In front of a crowded restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, the ladies were horrified at the encounter. My mother,  a STRONG Texas lady, was tempted to set Sarah straight, but trying to not add anymore anxiety to the event, held her tongue and left.  She did, however, do what consumers of her generation do and fired off snail mail letters to the local restaurant and one to the CEO and CMO at the Huntington Beach, CA headquarters.  (She may not use social media, but she does know how to Google!) So BJ's may not care about losing the business of 8 elderly women, but those women have kids and grandkids, with more discretionary income, that live all over the US.  And for this San Diego Yelper, who lives down the street from BJ's and eats out about 20 times a month, I will not be going back unless my mom or I get a response on how this situation and future situations like this have been addressed.  (May I suggest a customer service for Seniors training course!) In this age of the ""Graying of America"", consumer focused, hospitality businesses need to realize that our senior community cannot be treated like second class citizens.  They have the money and the time to enjoy these amenities and will frequent those that are gracious to them.  They are a loyal demographic and should be welcomed, not chastised.  There are plenty of competitors of yours that offer seniors special deals or menus, the least you can do is be kind. And lastly BJ's I am borrowing this quote: ""Good Lord willing, you too will be a senior one day; whatever age that may be. And you too will want to be treated with patience, understanding and, most of all, respect.""   I am sure that Greg Trojan, Kevin Mayer and Lon Ledwith will agree. UPDATED 2/13/17 After the kind and thoughtful reply from BJ's Management (which came Sunday evening, I was impressed) I am hopeful that BJ's is taking this situation seriously and will do all they can to resolve the customer service situation quickly and professionally. Thank you BJ's, I hope after some follow up, I will be able to be back and positively reviewing your food and nothing negative!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20
Caron L.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2017,"We tried eating here on a Tuesday night and was told by the greeter that it would be an hour wait. We had no problems waiting but after a two hour wait we still had no table. There were tables on the side but the Dinning Room Manager Richard Blosser insisted that since they had no waiter in that area he could not sit us there. We were waiting for a party that had eaten and were just sitting there talking for over an hour. This makes absolutely no sense, we decided to eat somewhere due to terrible service!!!! If you have a big party I would recommend choosing another establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20
Rena G.,"Houston, TX",206,166,266,3.0,8/29/2016,"This past Saturday we made the drive over to 1960 to celebrate a birthday and tried BJ's Brewhouse for the first time...long story short, we were not blown away. Like all restaurants on Saturday, the place was packed and we had a party of 7 meeting. Three of our family members were already there when we walked in and were waiting. The hostess told us that they could not sit us until the whole party showed up, no big deal since I'm familiar with other places that have this policy. Then another snooty waiter guy told me that they could sit us if half of our party was there. Um, there were 5 people there out of 7! and they still did not seat us. (And yet larger parties than us were seated before we were, even though their entire party wasn't there-we noticed more people arriving after they were seated)  I did not want to get upset since it was a special occasion, so when that snarky waiter guy told us that and yet still did not seat us even though more than half of the party was there, I was just like ""Jesus, take the wheel!!"" We were just waiting on 2 others which were a few minutes away. Finally, our remaining party guests showed up and then a good 10 minutes later, they finally sat us down. Not a good first impression already.  When we were finally seated, the evening seemed to be turning up. Our waitress was really nice and on top of her game, and brought out our drinks super fast. I noticed that they have a large menu with typical items that you'd find in other chain restaurants, ribs, burgers, salads, pizzas, etc. During this visit, I wasn't feeling a beer, so I opted for a strawberry mojito, which for almost $10, was not strong at all. For our entrees, I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos $9.95 (comes with mixed grains bowl) the bf ordered the mushroom burger with french fries. The rest of the family ordered, a southern fried chicken plate, vegetable penne, New Orleans Jambalaya and the Parmesan crusted chicken.  To be fair, my food was good, no complaints and the other dishes at the table looked very tasty but to me, the food wasn't  OHMYGODTHISISSOGOOD!! It was just ok. Nothing that will make me drive all the way back. Some of our family members ordered a few of their brewed beers and they all said they were really good but I did not try them during my visit. At the end of our meal, they were accommodating and brought out a special dessert that were ordered discreetly for the birthday boy. As I mentioned, our waitress was a doll. For the life of me, I can't remember her name but she was awesome, stayed on top of our drinks and checked up on us regularly. For me and the bf, our total was $59 (excluding tip for our awesome waitress) but to me, that's overpriced for 2 entrees a few drinks and one birthday dessert. Not worth it to me. Overall, I can say that I've tried BJ's Brewhouse but it's not somewhere that I can see myself making the drive to try again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20

Kathleen R.,"Tomball, TX",15,113,302,4.0,3/16/2017,"I have been here at least five times. Sometimes it's crazy busy and sometimes we get a nice quiet dining experience. All of our servers have been fantastic, but there is one hostess that bears this attitude that she either doesn't want to be bothered or seating folks is inconvenient. Here lies the minus one star rating for FOH service or lack thereof. If really busy the hostesses will text you when your table is ready. You can also join a rewards program, ask your server for details! Despite that unfortunate hostess greeting, I think the food is pretty fantastic. The Wednesday Burger Special ($10, any burger) is completely worth it. I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect and pink! Fries are double fried and crispy, not greasy. The chicken lettuce wraps are a great appetizer or nice for a light meal. If you like beer, there's a plethora on tap and you can get a flight (4-sampler) for under $10.  I really liked the Tatonka (dark beer). There's a large menu with something for everyone and it feels more upscale than some of the surrounding eateries. My only other frustration is the narrow parking. We ARE in Texas folks! I would definitely recommend a visit. Be aware this is a brewery so evenings may be louder and busier, especially during game nights, as there are TVs surrounding the dining room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=20

Emma M.,"San Diego, CA",6,13,5,1.0,8/1/2017,"Was extremely disappointed with the terrible customer service that I received when trying to make a reservation at this BJs for my birthday dinner. When I called, a gentleman told me that they could not make a reservation because they have to be made 24 hrs in advance (I called at 2/3pm).  Knowing you have a possible 8-9 people coming for dinner, you would think they would be more accommodating and make an exception since a party this size means a solid bill. When I asked the gentleman for more help, he put me on hold to ""talk to his manager"", came back and said that they could only do a call ahead for us. He stated the call ahead wouldn't guarantee us a table. I declined the offer and took my business elsewhere to another restaurant that was much more accommodating.

Jahlik B.,"Hockley, TX",0,6,,1.0,7/20/2017,My co-workers went ordered from BJ's last week. The food smelled so good I knew I had to try it. We decided to have them deliver to the office today for lunch. I ordered chicken Alfredo with broccoli. My first issue with the website is that it kept requesting we change out delivery time. We waited an hour and a half for a delivery from a place that is 3 miles aways. I received my food and my chicken Alfredo was missing the most important ingredient. There is no sauce on my pasta. None at all. It did come on side. It was not in another bag. How am I supposed to eat The pasta without any sauce. This was very disappointing.

Denise C.,"Almeada Heights, TX",248,5,,1.0,1/28/2017,"I've never left an establishment more upset than I did tonight. Our waiter accidentally spilled a container of soy sauce all over myself, my purse, my phone, and my leather jacket. He apologized and brought us towels to mop up the sauce ourselves all over the booth. If it wasn't bad enough I had to soak up the sauce myself from our table and my belongings, it took the manager over 10 minutes to come by. He was very unsympathetic and offered to buy the plate the soy sauce was spilled from then walked away. I was left with my pants soaking wet and feeling irrelevant.

Today I decided to make another visit to the restaurant and had my usual medium rare ribeye which was very good. It wasn't until I started eating the mashed potatoes that I all of a sudden projectile vomited the potatoes and only the potatoes onto my plate, I was lucky to be able to conceal it under my napkin for the sake of the customers, however. This may be TMI but the potatoes had a very distinct rotten milk smell when it came out and I did not have any dairy product today either. I brought this to the attention of the waiter (he was still tipped very well for his service, for he was very friendly) who notified the manager who seemed to put the blame on food poisoning from something I had eaten earlier today and didn't have the decency to check on me personally. I did not feel well after and did not have energy to argue for any sort of compensation, rather I choose to never bring my business there again. I always order huge meals and tip VERY generously.

Since I am still new to Houston I've been trying to try places I haven't been before and this was one of them. The menu was very typical so I just kept it simple when ordering. We ordered boneless wings, Brussel sprouts, and has traditional wings as well. Everything was good, but as I stated it wasn't anything too spectacular The server we had was very attentive and she didn't continue harassing us like some of the restaurants do. She met our needs and even provided us with a complimentary dessert. We had a child with us, and sometimes children take a long time to decide what it is that they want, but she was very patient. The restaurant was very clean and the atmosphere was welcoming. There were more families here than I would have expected.

An hour came and went but we still had not been seated. My friend asked the hostess what was going on and he informed her that they were waiting on a table to leave who had already been there 4 hours. Clearly making more money was not important because we had watched that table close out their bills a while ago. It took for my best friend to go back up to the hostess counter and complain for us to finally be seated. It took a while to order and the food to come. Once it did the food was not hot, just warm. I was willing to overlook all of this until my boyfriend got hit it he back with a tray by one of the waitresses. It wasn't even the one who was serving us. She asked if he was okay and apologized and left. He had a huge wet spot on his shirt from the tray. I don't understand how she hit him especially when he was leaned forward. No one ever came back by to check on him it make sure he was fine. We were still waiting on our desert at this point. The service we had on a night where we should have been celebrating was horrible.

We stop in at this location a lot for business lunches and rarely have a negative experience.  On my last visit, I had Parmesan crusted chicken, steamed broccoli and cheese infused mashed potatoes, all of which hit the spot. The server was great, and very attentive... the only issues we ran into had to do with food prep... my sister is a vegetarian, which she stated at the onset, yet her wedge salad contained bacon bits and had to be sent back, and the sauce she asked to be placed on the side for her sandwich, was not.

Sunnysuraj P.,"Houston, TX",22,7,9,4.0,11/18/2015,"Been here a few more times now and my mind's changed a little bit. I don't wanna be too harsh, but a few points stand out to me: The food isn't always warm. Side dishes such as roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes, and even main dishes such as the chicken or mahi-mahi tend to be room temperature when they arrive. Dishes which are not are usually things like pizza or soups. My asparagus was also not crunchy but really soggy. I'd be okay if it was a rare occurrence but I've come here a few times during dinner and this seems to be rather common. The appetizers are great, and usually more reliably ""fresh"" -- but the main courses tend to be lukewarm at best. Refills on drinks are alright; they're not the speediest but I'm not crunching ice until the end of my meal. I get that this place is busy, though, so I'm not too bothered by that. They do pretty well considering that, but it could definitely be a lot better.  Service is otherwise incredibly friendly. They definitely seem attentive and do well checking up.

Ashley Y.,"Houston, TX",103,428,480,3.0,5/21/2014,BJ is always one of my favorite restaurant and I have never been to this location before. I came here on a Saturday for lunch. I found the mahi mahi from the menu and it looked so good. Well. It came with scallop too. The scallop were pretty good still. The mahi mahi is a lit too dry.( Even tho it suppose taste dry but it is too dry)  I did not bother to finish it. I also ordered ahi tuna for appetizer which was not bad.  Overall I still like this restaurant in all the locations I have been so far.

The pizza selection and their own root beer is what attracts me here. Oh, and their avocado egg rolls! These are must have items when dining in.  You can't compare their pizza to any other kitchen. They have buffalo chicken, sweet pig, and many more types that make me eat to where I smile with happiness. The food always tastes great. One time, the avocado egg rolls didn't look too presentable and it was probably missing something, but it still tasted delicious.  Sometimes I eat so much I forget about desert. If you have room for desert, definitely add a pazookie into your tab. You will probably regret it later after you leave, but it's so damn delicious!  The service here is okay. I think the night crew is slacking a bit, but at the same time I can see how the size of the crowd here can take up their attention.

I would recommend the Nutty Brewnette and the Hopstorm IPA ~ Most visits my table starts off with the spring rolls, though I have had (and enjoyed) their calamari, before I move on to my all-time favorite pizza: the BBQ chicken pizza. Flavorful sauce, tomatoes, red onions, and large chucks of pizza on a thick dough with crispy edges. Delicious! You may have to sit through very mediocre service when you come to BJ's, though. In my experience, the server is either overbearing or doesn't know what to do and messes up the order. Not to mention the wait to be seated! Being on 249 and 1960 this location gets a lot of foot traffic, and I think being next to Whiskey River helps BJ's get customers for their menu of pizza, pasta, and potatoes to soak up all of the.. well, whiskey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=80

I didn't realize how much food I'd be getting though. It was two fried steaks on top of mashed potatoes and gravy along with steamed vegetables on the side. To finish my meal, I had the cookies & creme ""pizookie"" which is essentially a fresh out of the oven cookie with ice cream on top.

We were thankful to snag a 4-seat high-top in the bar on both visits. With TV's positioned throughout the establishment, there was no shortage of good viewing angles. On both visits, the service was very good with everybody in the Astros frenzied spirit. During our first visit we enjoyed a variety of appetizers including buffalo wings and calamari. Our second visit was Halloween night - stay home and dole out treats or go out and cheer on the Astros? No dilemma here! On this night my wife enjoyed wings again (they were quite good first visit and she's been on a bit of a wings kick lately). I noticed that BJ's offers prime rib (a favorite of mine) but only on weekends. Bummer. So I opted for the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was quite flavorful. We topped off our meal by sharing a chocolate chunk pizcookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Kristin A.,"Spring, TX",3,71,6,2.0,11/10/2017,"My wife and I went to BJ's today for the first time. She is a veteran and was going for the free entree offer for vets (up to $12.95 value). We opened the menu and were surprised to discover that despite the fact that my wife was supposed to get a free entree, we would still have to pay something for hers, because practically none of the entrees cost less than $13. The food was overpriced for glorified bar food at what is basically a gastropub. I think we saw two salads under that amount, and since she isn't a rabbit, she ordered a $13.75 burger. I ordered the supposedly deep dish ziti for $14.95.  The food arrived after a long time, and we received another rude surprise: the small food quantities, particularly that of my pasta. I have never gotten so little pasta and paid so much for it. My ""deep dish"" ziti was only half full in a dish the width of a salad plate. I'm a small woman with only a modest appetite, and the portion was so small I ate the whole thing! I have never ordered pasta at a restaurant and not brought home at least half of it. My wife ordered a buffalo brisket burger and the patty was small compared to the bun and the cheese was pretty skimpy as well.

Macy B.,"Houston, TX",49,64,8,1.0,6/16/2017,"BJ's is one of those classic places where dining should be easy and relaxed and great service is expected, considering it's a chain with a good reputation. Tonight, however, defied all good impressions I once had on this restaurant.  When we put our name down for a table we were told it'd be a 15-20 minute wait. 25 minutes passed so I went to the counter to check on the status of the table. 3 people were behind the computer talking amongst themselves, obviously not caring if I heard because one of them said ""she's only been waiting 25 minutes"" (only??). Then I said we were told 15-20 minutes and the server argued back and said ""actually we told you 30-45 minutes and it's only been 25 minutes"".  Good management is to never talk back to a customer and to make everyone feel welcome (neither happened).  Finally, we get seated. The waiter made the whole experience so much worse for us. We were a party of 9 and he was constantly forgetting things, like to take someone's order at the other end of the table or to bring our drinks. We'd ask for a fork or an extra plate and never get them, so we'd have to share forks or seek another waiter to get plates. He brought out my fiance's meal before our appetizers, and before everyone else's meals/appetizer so it was awkward for him to eat alone. Then, he spilled water all over my fiancé and cleaned it up so poorly that I had to take the towel from him and clean it myself. We heard a loud thump a few minutes later and it was our waiter who dropped all our pizookies on the ground! It's time for the check and we realize ours was very cheap, and we were thinking ""wow, he comped our meal for us!"" But no, he just accidentally placed them on someone else's tab.  All in all it was a pretty disappointing night. I hope management reads this because I don't want anyone else to experience this kind of service again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston

The fish was cooked just right, moist and flaky.  I'm no stranger to quinoa but I had never actually tried it before.  Delicious compliment with the tomatoes, mushrooms and asparagus.  Ate the whole thing..scrapped the bowl...no shame in my game!  I did get the dinner portion since I love salmon and its half the amount on the lunch.   I've visited BJ's chain, easy 10 times between Katy, Pearland Willowbrook and tried different dishes each time considering how their menu is almost as extensive as Cheesecake Factory.  Finally found my BJ's dish that I don't have to take a chance on...yeah!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston

Upon entering, the place had a slightly stinky smell to it.. maybe dirty mop water? Anyway, it didn't deter us from leaving yet lol. We ordered a chicken bacon ranch mini pizza, creamy mac n cheese couscous, Peruvian shrimp quinoa bowl, and honey crisp chicken salad. I was disappointed in the Mac and cheese. It was completely different than how I had it in Fort Collins and that was because it was crisply baked in the oven. It tasted just a bit under cooked. The quinoa bowl was mushy due to the tomatoes in the quinoa. The shrimp had good flavor though. The pizza was really good and the salad was good also.  I also ordered the gluten free mini pizookie, so good. Hopefully I don't get salmonella because it was slightly under baked.. just slightly but was still good.

Because I'm such a regular my points add up very quickly and I'm always looking to try new things on their menu.  If you aren't a big alcohol drinker but don't want water, I recommend the raspberry tea. It come in a cup with a sugar rim. Love the sweetness of it, you can also ask for them to make it more sweet or less sweet since it's regular tea with raspberry syrup.  Appetizers i recommend is the southwest rolls or if you are looking for simple you can't go wrong with the calamari or cheese sticks. My usuals are Atlantic salmon with extra butter sauce, clam chowder, or pasta. The salmon is amazing with the rice and butter sauce. It's a great compliment to the meal and is super filling. The clam chowder can be a bit salty, but it's still very yummy for a sick day. You can never go wrong with pasta.  Some sides I like are the thin cut fries if you are looking to eat a burger. Mash potatoes are great as well, amazingly seasoned to compliment my taste buds.  They're known for great dessert as well, so just give them a try if you are still hungry after the meal.

But the refill came out flat.  Told that I would need to wait on the mix to get changed out.  Switched to sweet tea.  Never got a refill and was never offered one.   3. Fries that came with my meal were overcooked.  Must have had a fryer issue.  Was not given or offered ketchup for them.  Did not see my waiter again, so could not ask. 4. Tried the chicken bacon ranch piadinas was ok, but seemed a bit overcooked. 5. Did not see our waiter much.  Other people brought our food out.  I did not get refills or condiments.

Leslie T.,"Houston, TX",170,588,264,3.0,5/14/2014,"It's your basic Applebee's, Chili's, Ruby Tuesday clone with some specialty brews. My review should just end there. Anyone who knows those places knows there will be burgers and some fancy overpriced salads and some fried apps. And that's what the menu consists of once you get past the hundred pages of specialty drinks in the front of the menu. I had the basic margarita and it was very sour. I think they need to adjust their mix a bit. Margaritas should be limey tart goodness...but not too puckery. I have tried their brews at another location. If you like craft beers these are pretty decent. You know what you like so sit at the bar and ask for a taste. They'll give you a small glass before you order a pint. The little sliders were your basic tiny buns and tiny meat with some really good pickles. The French Dip was a basic Sammy, nothing to write here about. The thing that really made this place feel pedestrian was my salad. They had what looked like a tasty new salad on the menu: Kale and Brussels sprouts.  Here's the outline: Baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette.  The waitress brought it to me. I love Brussels sprouts and couldn't wait. I dug around in the thing and there were no Brussels sprouts anywhere. I don't remember seeing blueberries or cranberries either. I told her there were missing parts and she took it away. She came back and said she was sorry they were ""out of Brussels sprouts. But they would be happy to make me something else"". Most of my party was halfway done with their meals and I just told her to take it off our bill. She did.  But really? You brought me a specialty salad with Brussels sprouts in the main description on the menu and the kitchen said nothing about not adding them? It wasn't her fault. It was the kitchen managers fault. Kinda like ordering a bacon cheeseburger and having it come out without the bacon and yet they still charge you for the bacon cheeseburger. Not cool. The place is really loud. If you come in with a large party of 5 or 6 and they steer you toward a horseshoe booth ask if they have a table.

Lauren S.,"Houston, TX",5,20,1,5.0,1/28/2015,"I usually would not amply promote any sort of salt-laden chain restaurant, but this is my go-to place to get gluten pizza, if I'm not making it myself.  Huge place, always busy for dinner, but you'll never find yourself screaming at others for them to hear you.  Seating is comfortable, waiters are friendly, but sort of absent when it gets busier.  Full bar, they offer beer flights, decent lunch specials, and have a HUGE dinner menu. I don't think anyone could NOT find something to eat here. When I don't feel like anything greasy, I get a salad. Their salads are delicious here people. Delicious and huge, but definitely not calorie friendly if that's what you're going for. However I do believe they have a list of low-cal items on the menu, which is some sort of grilled (frozen) protein and a heaping serving of (frozen) steamed veggies.  Come on, it's BJ's, it's not going to knock your socks off, but you're certainly not going to be disappointed that you came. I've never had a bad experience personally.  Gluten Freers: Rejoice! This is the best, readily available, casual restaurant gluten free pizza out there (the upper scale pizza award goes to Coal Vines). Did I also mention it is a giant pie, and reheats (baked) well?

I dropped in around 11ish, so there were no children there, but this seems to be a place that you can bring the kiddos w/ no problems.  Their special thing is their own craft beers. I tried the blonde ale which was pretty good. Food wise, I went for the fried wontons Thai style & the Corn & Bacon fritters...YUMMY!!! And for $3 each it was a steal. The dipping sauses for both were really good.  Bartender was really sweet. They let you have a taste of the specialty drafts before you order which is a plus. Chatted it up w/ a couple of folks that seem to be regulars. Very nice vibe to the place. Noticed they hustled to keep the place clean & in order even w/ the busy Saturday crowd.  The menu here is HUGE!! In fact, I think this is the only negative thing I can think of from my 1st run. There's sooo much stuff on the menu, it's almost overwhelming. Perhaps if it was designed better it would be a little more eye catching. You open it & there's just words/food everywhere.  I will be going back to try some other things I saw on the menu.

Since I no longer struggle with a gluten or dairy sensitivity, I deviated from my usual gluten-free pizza order (great selection here for gluten free folks!!) and settled on the Original Roast Beef Dip sandwich with their wedge-cut seasoned fries. After witnessing my mom's bad experience with the French Dip at La Madeleine, I was nervous to try the French Dip sandwich at BJ's, which isn't a ""French cafe"", but it turns out that I had nothing to be nervous about. BJ's does a way better French Dip than La Madeleine! The roast beef inside the sandwich is juicy and tender, and the French roll is doughy and soft-- a great contrast to the savory beef and caramelized onions that are fun to rip apart with your teeth. The au jus has just the right amount of flavor too. I was really impressed. I had a bite of my grandma's avocado egg rolls, which have always been and STILL are delicious.

I would've just ordered that add a meal.  I'm a veggie lover so don't judge me.  Lol everybody else with me lived their food as well.  The sting fries were surprisingly flavorful and my nephew who doesn't like broccoli enjoyed the broccoli in his pasta.  Besides the lack of broccoli on my plate and the waitress Taylor providing just ok services.  Everything was great.  Would definitely come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=140

Mark B.,"South Burlington, VT",117,112,1,3.0,8/3/2014,"Take a standard chain of mediocrity, and add mediocre beer brewed in house. Not to say that it's a terrible place; it isn't. But it's not like super stand out either. I had a chicken dish that was very flavorful...it was a crusted parmesan with a nice sauce. Service was very good. Staff were friendly. Where it kinda goes wrong is with the beer. I'm a beer snob, I'll admit. I've had everything from Heady Topper to MGD, and I know how to make every style, and have tasted some of the best of each. Their beers are just OK. What makes it worse is the knowledge of the staff. First, you're not supposed to touch the tap to the glass, nor overfill above the tap. But that's a minor infraction. Where it gets worse is when you have no clue how to serve the varieties you offer. My IPA was served in a pilsner glass. That's the very tall, narrow, V shaped glass. Which totally KILLS the hoppy aromas of an IPA. You can't properly immerse your nose in them, like with a proper tulip or IPA glass.  Then I decided to get a Paulaner Hefeweizen instead, as they had it on draft, and I figured that would be better. It was not served in the tall, curvy ""Weißbier"" glass, but in a standard American pint glass instead. Again, the glass design enhances the beer - most places that serve Hefeweizen, that claim to be brewpubs, and make the motions would know these things. A Hefeweizen glass has the curves to catch sediments and the yeast, and also enhances the aromas of that style beer. I asked the bartender about it and he sheepishly admitted they only had the two types of glasses; he genuinely seemed ashamed that someone had called them out on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=140

We got there after 11:00 on a Sunday night. Our food took at least 25 minutes to come out. The food was tasty enough.  My daughter asked for a drink refill and ranch for her french fries when her food was delivered. She was finished with her steak by the time the waitress came back by our table. We had to remind her about the refill and ranch. By the time it was delivered the fries were ice cold and she didn't need the ranch after all. Our feeling about our experience tonight would have been so much better if we had had service.  There was no apparent manager checking on things.  The bar tender stayed behind the bar taking constant care of the 4 people that were there.  The hostess just stood there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=140

Better than usual fare for a chain, very decent brews of their own along with guest beers. I like the nutty brunette and the stout. They had one of my favorite beers as a guest beer. Rogue dead guy ale. We shared appetizers, avacado egg rolls were delicious and filling. The roasted Brussel sprouts with sriracha sauce are outstanding and healthy.

Let's be honest, we didn't come for the food, we came for the on tap root beer.  There's something about that on tap root beer that makes life feel ok.  We ordered and waited for our food to arrive. I got the boneless wings with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese and I also ordered the italian market salad.  Our entrees came out and I let the server know that we never received our salads.  She came back with them in a few seconds and I was a bit disappointed because I was then overwhelmed by food.  I dug into the salad and it was limp, soggy and really lackluster at best.  What happened I think is they were made and sat back there with the dressing on them until she brought them out at least 15 minutes after they were made; judging by the sogginess level.  The bonesless wings were just ok but, the bleu cheese dressing was phenomenal.  The wings were only half coated in sauce and really looked like tiny chicken nuggets.  Also, the portion size was at least a pound which I find unnecessary.

When the waitress greeted me, I told her it was my first time there. I told her I was interested in the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. She said it was great. So I paired it with a Chardonnay and a house salad. I asked for no cheese on the salad and it came immediately with no cheese (the little victories). Perfect size before meal-not too much and not too little. I should've asked for dressing on the side, because it was a bit much. It didn't matter so much because I was hungry. In the midst of my salad, my entree arrived by a new server who was just as nice as the waitress. She asked if I had everything I needed. I mentioned I was waiting on my glass of Chardonnay to be delivered. She went to to check on it. Within the minute, my beautiful glass of wine arrived. Served was two pita tacos and a relish type looking side with beans, corn, seeds, quinoa, oil and spices, cucumber, green peppers, cilantro and barley. There was also a yogurt based sauce for the tacos. The tacos included grilled chicken, feta cheese, cilantro and maybe some veggies. The pairing of Chardonnay was perfect! With a packed restaurant, that has been the best service and food I have had since moving here four weeks ago. Outstanding service was provided to a complete single stranger in town for business. I didn't feel judged or ignored.  I will definitely be returning because the service was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=200

My wife loves their pastas and lately has been eating the chicken tortilla soup.  The kids really love the boneless wings and all the sauces. They have an amazing selection of beer on tap (including one from Stone Brewery which I love to death, St. Arnold's Endeavor and Karbach's Hoppadilla).  They also have a huge selection of Belgian bottled beer.  The BJ beers are all excellent as well as the brewed root beer, cream soda, etc. As for service, they tend to be top notch.

Also really love their california grilled chicken sandwich.  Green chilies, avocado, melted pepper jack, what's not to love?  I won't review every food I've eaten there, but I can honestly say that everything I've eaten there has been delicious.  And you should try a pizookie (picture a big warm, fresh cookie in a tin with a generous scoop of ice cream) and a beer or the berry cider (for the ladies who don't like beer) if you go.  I have never met a pizookie I didn't greatly enjoy...even the ones I initially turned up my nose at ended up being good.  Ok, enough said. :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=200

Alicia J.,"Austin, TX",135,303,14,4.0,8/9/2011,"I feel like I've had an abnormal amount of gluten free pizza lately, but I'm just making up for lost time. I'm just thankful people are offering it now. BJ's isn't the best GF pizza I've had, but it certainly isn't the worst. (Looking at you, Austin's Pizza.) Bonus points to them for brushing an herb butter of some sort on the crust before baking, and for what looks like herbs mixed into the actual crust as well. Now there's something you don't find often in a gluten free crust. All of my love and all of my kisses for that gluten free pizookie, though. It's not often you find a GF item on the dessert menu that isn't flan/creme brulee/ice cream/sorbet and it was DELICIOUS. My co-diners said they couldn't even taste a difference in the cookie, and it was soft, gooey, and fresh-out-of-the-oven delicious when served. The best part of this dining experience (for me) was that I didn't have to ask if they had a gluten free menu. All GF items were clearly labeled and even advertised in the standard menu. I don't like people fussing over me or paying special attention, so being able to flip through and order from the same menu as everyone else was a really nice touch.

I've tried their deep-dish pizzas, Spinach stuffed mushrooms, Gourtmet Mac & Cheese, Louisiana style Pasta, Jumbalaya, Pizookies, and cocktails. -Spinach stuffed mushrooms- I would say it's a 5/5. The sauce is pretty good and they don't drench the mushrooms with the sauce which was a plus. -Gourmet Mac & Cheese- 3/5, I would say it's a little different from the mac and cheese most people imagine. The cheese is on the light side and it's not saucey like most mac and cheese dishes. The presentation of the mac and cheese was really nice but I've had better. -Deep dish pizza- 3/5, the Gourmet five meat pizza is really good but when I think of deep-dish I think of Chicago style deep-dish. The pizza isn't as cheesy but the pizza is good. Meat lovers should try the Gourmet five meat. I've tried their pepperoni pizza and it was average. -Pizookie- 5/5 AMAZING. All of their pizookies are good. However, the triple chocolate is definitely for chocolate lovers. SO sweet and very chocolate-y/. I usually stick with Cookies and cream and White Macadamia nut pizookie. Red velvet is pretty good, too. You can sample 3 pizookies for  $10.  -Jack lemonade is pretty good.

Hillary B.,"Houston, TX",0,11,1,1.0,4/29/2013,"I ate here with family yesterday at 2 pm. I am absolutely disgusted with how a simple mistake was handled with the food. Besides being slow (nearly 40 minutes to be seated...well over the 10-15 minute quoted wait time) and having to ask five people for silverware, I had the pleasure of our waitress trying to cover up a burger having cheese instead of getting the kitchen to remake me one without cheese. I had ordered a burger without mayo or dressing (the menu lists a hamburger completely separate from cheeseburgers) and when it came, I checked o make sure it had no dressing. To my surprise, I saw globs of yellow in a corner - it looked like morons had stuck cheese on the burger and then pulled it off when they realized it wasn't supposed to have it on there. Absolutely disgusting. I brought it to her attention and she took it back to the kitchen - I figured that I'd get a new burger...yeah, no. Two minutes later, she's back with the burger, claiming it's ""new"" (I know it takes longer than two minutes to cook that...and taking food from other diner's orders to correct a mistake is rather uncool). Nope. She lied. It was the EXACT burger with a corner cut off. How gross. So customers can't get what they order and when mistakes are made, get the mistake poorly covered up instead of new food? To make matters worse, on the other side of the patty, there's tons of cheese bits. I get the actress again and tell her that its the same burger and there's still cheese all over it. I told her I am allergic to cheese and she's arguing with me that it's ""meat juice"" not cheese. Yeah, no...I know what cheese looks like. Finally she takes it back and I eventually get a burger made correctly. Nothing's comped, I'm disgusted by the way the food was handled (touching MY food that I'm supposed to eat to cut a chunk out instead of getting a new meal made????), and I'm annoyed over how rude/lazy/incompetent our server is. I wish I had spoken to a manager, but I didn't want to make a scene and I just wanted to get out of that place.  I don't understand how someone can mess up like that and then argue with me over it.

Back home, I'd usually stick to just the deep dish pizza, but since moving here, I like exploring the rest of their menu.  Their salads are good; can't go wrong with fish and chips and their teriyaki chicken dish is awesome.  I try to stay away from their chicken sandwiches as they usually disappoint me.  No matter what you do, always leave room for a pizookie! Overall, I enjoy the food and the service staff rock.   I usually drive to the restaurant but leave the driving home to my wife.  The beer is good and their seasonal selections are worth trying.  The Grand Cru is a strong Belgian-style ale that is served in a small glass (10% alc for those thinking about throwing down a few).  The Irish Root Beer and Sangria(s) are also excellent. The only downside is the wait, but that happens everywhere in in Houston starting at 5pm, Friday-Sunday.  So chill out at the bar with a brew.

But that's long gone. Now its just $1 off beers (so they're like $4.50 on special), happy hour only in the bar, and varied staff with high turn over. Not quite the place it used to be.

Richard M.,"Houston, TX",1,32,,3.0,1/2/2010,"If you're looking for a traditional brewpub type experience you're sure to be disappointed with BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  This is a chain where the food is just mediocre and the beer ...well the beer obviously is not their first priority.  Houston is the home of Bud, Miller, etc., if you want GOOD home craft brewed beer at a restaurant/pub you'll have to go to Austin or some other city for that. The interior of this place is set up very nice and open with a clean modern look.  They have bar and restaurant seating offering table or booth seats.  I'm not really sure how they get away with calling this place a brewhouse since they don't actually make any beer at this location nor have I ever seen any working brewery equipment.  As far as I know the beer served in their Houston restaurants is still contract brewed at St. Arnolds Brewery.  They really need to change their name to ""BJ's Restaurant"" and just drop the ""Brewhouse"" altogether. I've been here a few times and have had an opportunity to try a few of their beers (or should I say St. Arnold's beers).  They have a list of beers they regularly stock and a few seasonal/specialties on tap.  The beer is not bad but the prices are a bit outrageous, you'll spend the same for one beer as you would for a six pack at home.  I've had the BJ's PM Porter which is pretty good if you  like really dark beer.  Overall BJ's would be better off if they just offered a wide variety of craft beers that people are familiar with... Their menu is all over the place, from salads to fish to pizza to sandwiches/soups to tacos.  The portions are pretty large but the food is only mediocre.  As mentioned by others the avocado egg rolls are good.  Stay away from the fish and chips as I found it to be very tasteless.  I had the fish tacos on their lunch menu recently which was actually pretty decent (the fish is breaded and fried which I don't normally like). They serve a warm 5 inch diameter chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of ice cream (it's not an original but it is tasty). This place would be better if they focused on doing a few things really well instead of trying to serve EVERYTHING with only mediocre success.

The chicken parmesan sandwich for $6.95 with fries is a nice filling portion however, wayyyy too much mayonnaise for them to claim any sort of healthy choice option there.  i like BJs because it has a fun lively atmosphere and the restaurant always looks spic and span clean, but i think the quality of food is mediocre at best. i suppose my expectations are too high; it is just another chain after all.  but maybe my real disappointment came from my table who didn't want to order a pizookie. i'll be back for that---just won't order from the lunch menu or i'll make sure to eat first before eating here...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=260

Olivia K.,"Houston, TX",406,363,319,3.0,11/6/2012,"For a chain brewhouse restaurant, it's pretty good. It's a typical chain with the menu and food preparation, which explains why you can only find them in the suburbs of Houston. Personally, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants because they lack originality and uniqueness. I met a blind date here, so it wasn't my choice to drive to the suburbs to eat here, but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think there was anything outstanding about the food, but it was prepared well with no problems. I'm just not a fan of oversized portions of typical American bar/restaurant food. I'm not a beer drinker and it was too early in the day for me to start drinking, so I opted for one of their in-house crafted sodas and it was amazing! For beer lovers, they do keep St. Arnolds on tap in order to keep the locals coming back, but still offer a full bar as well as bottled beers. The decor is dark and warm with a very swag cigar-smoking type feel, minus the actual smoke. I sat at the bar instead of sitting in the main dining area. I always enjoy sitting at the bar as a means of feeling like there is a different ambiance than being seated amongst the overwhelming number of families that use the main dining area. Being childless means that I'm not tolerant of your screaming baby behind me while I'm trying to eat and carry on a conversation. The hand crafted root beer alone was worth returning, but I may pass on having an actual meal and stick with an appetizer or one of the indulgent cookie desserts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=240

It was suggested by the waiter as I was in two minds to get that, or the fish n chips. I was somewhat disappointed at the taste. It wasn't bad by any means, but just lacked real flavor. It tasted as thou it had been cooked in old oil and wasn't seasoned enough. The potatoes were good thou. I would say this is a great place if you want a nice dining experience without paying the $$.

Kari M.,"Houston, TX",221,517,724,4.0,9/8/2010,"Went on a Labor Day evening with my entire family. There were 10 of us and they let us make a reservation about 3 hours before hand, which I thought was cool because they usually don't let people make reservations with that short of an advance. The drink menu was ridiculously huge. I didn't drink anything but water, but the first 4 or 5 pages are nothing but drink specials! I ordered the Honey-Chicken Salad and it was yummy! It had fresh egg slices and tomatoes. One of the best salads I've had in a while.  We also had a deep dish pizza with everything on it. I had a bite of a slice. It was pretty delicious.  I had a bite of my husbands bacon burger too....wow. That was not was I was expecting. I was really tasty and served on bread instead of buns. Our server was good on keeping my water full and bantered with us a lot. They even let us bring in homemade pies for my Dad's birthday.

Mai S.,"Houston, TX",53,236,98,3.0,10/5/2010,"I really like the Pizzookies from here. Get the classic chocolate chunk with vanilla icecream. Tasty. Food-wise. There's a pretty good cut of everything. The portions are big too. I never finish my meal. I like the Roasted Turkey Sandwich and the Gourmet Mac and Cheese is delicious. I love the steak cut fries too. I had the Pot Roast Sandwich before too and it was a little too salty for my taste.  The pastas are ok but the garlic bread is great. The Garlic Parmesan Kettle Style Chips I would pass on. Kinda pricey for some chips in my opinion. The Mini-bruschetta is good though. I've had the potatoes too and they are good but nothing special.  I think most people order the pizza from here. I think it's pretty good. I'm pretty boring so I order the Margherita pizza which is good. I tried the brewed root beer which again is okay.

When the rest of the party showed up we had already ordered drinks & appetizers she saw that we needed a high chair and said they are not allowed to have a high chair at the booth, that's fine but instead of reseating us at a open table they said it was spoken for & they were going to make us get up and wait on another table so we went and got the car seat and stayed in booth with car seat stuffed in between us. Now the food...we ordered beers everyone except one were brought their drinks, after 5 minutes we told waiter we were short 1 beer he said he would check after 5 more minutes we reminded him again he then said they were out of the brand ordered. At what point was he going to tell us!!!! Remember the appetizers I mentioned? We ordered a spinach artichoke dip and when it came out we grabbed some chips and were HORRIFIED!! To find an old dried up lemon wedge in the chips!!! Are they putting used chips back in the chip bin???!!! Do not know why at this point we just didn't get up and leave??

They didn't have much flavor by themselves but the sauce that comes with it makes the eggrolls pretty amazing.  Other than that, not much else to report. The beer was pretty good but not great. I tried the Blonde and the Hefewiezen. We were corrected by the waitress that it is pronounced with a 'w' not a 'v'. I hate when people correct you with an incorrect correction.  Anyways, I ordered the BJ's Favorite small pizza. It was loaded with toppings, which I loved! I went in for my second mouthful and was met with under cooked dough. I guess with all the toppings it is difficult to tell that the pizza was finished. I ended up just not eating the middle parts of my slices.  The service was so-so at best. We sat a lot waiting for refills and silverware and other things that we needed.  The price was ok. For 2 meals, 2 beers and half of the appetizer it was a $40 bill before tip. There was pizza left over which was taken for lunch today.

I am not normally a fan of chains and BJ's is a pretty big chain. This is the first time I have been to one in a long time. First, I was impressed by the beer menu. Not only did they have a good selection of their own beers, but they had a really good selection of other beers, both draft and bottled. To be just a bit persnicketty, I would have liked it if they had an IPA in their beers. We started with a flatbread to share amongst the 6 of us. It was really good and there was plenty to go around. The menu variety was also very good, there were plenty of interesting choices. The pictures in the menu also looked very good. I selected a cuban burger. I ordered it cooked medium and the waiter didn't argue about that. It came cooked very nicely medium. It was very good. The fries were mediocre. Everyone else commented favourably on their food. Our waiter was good. The place was quite busy, but he managed to be on hand just about every time we needed him. He was cheerful but did seem like he was just barely hanging on.

But this place has staying power just because the menu is so good. American fare that has been cared for - they truly make it worth coming here for. The deep dish pizza is great and the kiddie menu, although simple, is excellent. The pasta dish I had recently here (with chicken alfredo) was bland, but almost everything else I've had here was very good indeed. Even their blonde beer is good (I am SO tired of how every microbrew has to be full of hops and this one is not). Service here has also always been attentive and fast every time I've visited.

It's nice to see this brewpub successful when so many in Houston have gone under. It seems we like beer here, it just has to be Bud or Coors in tonnage, rather than 'taste'. Their menu stretches across a variety of ethnic items but often with an American twist. Service tends to be good but sometimes struggles when busy. Ordered food comes fairly prompt, and the waiters seem to know when you're babbling instead of ordering, and will take/place a salad or appetizer while you continue to yack and sporadically read the menu.

Not very friendly nor is she helpful towards the other bartender. The other bartender has been helpful and made the experience worth the while.

Janet W.,"Spring, TX",13,12,2,5.0,11/5/2010,"Who said there's no such thing as a free lunch? Along with approximately 90,000 other people in the community, I was invited to sample the menu at new BJ's Restaurant & Brew house, renowned for its microbrewed beers and delectable manly portions. Facebook is abuzz with diners who have already been there. I was invited to accompany a good friend, Annette, and one of her other friends, ""Barb."" After exchanging greetings in the chilly parking lot, we entered BJ's to a warm reception where we were greeted by a very friendly hostess named ""Courtney"" who informed us that our server would be ""Allison."" A charming ""Austin"" appeared instead, which was certainly alright with us, and who good-naturedly went along with the joke, as we called him ""Allison"" for the duration of our meal.  First, Allison (Austin) took the drink orders. Annette ordered an extra dry martini Stoli with extra olives. Talk about a 'call' drink. I didn't know martinis could get that fancy. And blonde Barb ordered a Brewhouse Blonde. (Say that four times fast after drinking an extra dry martini Stoli with extra olives.) There were so many drink choices that I was confused, so Austin (alias Allison) appropriately suggested a Confusion... Hpnotiq, which is a blend of vodka, cognac, and natural exotic fruit juices including a strawberry puree, raspberry Stoli, and a splash of pineapple juice. Now that's a drink! After downing it halfway, I was even more confused, but convinced that I was drinking healthy. It was suggested that we each try something different from the menu, which is always more fun so you can graze from each other's plates. Barb ordered the Sweet Pig Pizza...a deep-dish pizza with ham, pineapple, and roasted tomatoes (ordering the smallest size.) For a pizza crust so thick, it was light as a feather. Incidentally, you can order your pizza gluten-free. Annette ordered the fish and chips. Being kitchen-impaired, I'm assuming the fish was fried in a beer batter as BJ's certainly has enough beer on hand. It wasn't that cornmeal batter like everyone uses in this area of the country. It was a thin, crunchy crust over flaky fish filets. (I'm not a food blogger, but I'm actually beginning to sound like one.) I was glad Annette couldn't eat all the fries, so I could finish them off. Typically I never order fries because they don't have any flavor, but these were thick and delicious. I usually order something I would never be able to prepare, so I ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.  You can order this grilled or blackened, and since I can't do either, I asked our server, Austin, to make a recommendation. The people who work in restaurants have usually sampled everything on the menu, so I value their opinion. He recommended the grilled chicken and assured me I would be pleased with it. I know, a lot of restaurants serve this dish, but not like the one I was served. The chicken wasn't in little chunks like you get out of can of chicken. It was slices of breast meat that were so tender, you didn't have to use a knife. I'm not savvy enough to tell you what seasonings were used, but the chicken was seasoned to perfection. And there was so much fettuccine pasta left over, that I had enough for a 'to go' box.    While waiting for our meals we oohed and aahed over other menu selections that were being served up around us. The salads were beautiful, and the burgers were huge! This will definitely be the place salad lovers will frequent for lunch, and the brews and burgers will make this a 'guy's night out' hangout. We opted for a desert instead of an appetizer, and unanimously agreed on the Pizookie. With my limited Italian, loosely translated means...a large cookie prepared like a pizza, thus Pizookie.  It was half cookie with chocolate chunks, and half with white Macadamian chunks, topped with vanilla ice cream.  Rarely eating desserts for lack of a sweet tooth, this dessert was a melt-in-your-mouth reward that really finished the meal off in fine fashion.   In addition to a quality meal, one thing I especially appreciated was the quality control. Andrew, not to be confused with Austin (alias Allison) or is it the other way around. I'm still confused, and I've only had one Confusion.  Andrew, the Quality Control trainer was following up on Austin's service, to ensure the 7 C's were being addressed: Community, Connection, Caring, Consistency, Control, Compassion, and Courage (an integral part of BJ's culture.)

Slow, slow, slow, and did not check on us at all. Very disappointed. We have always had a fairly good experience here, but not tonight. And, we had bragged on this place to our group we were with.

Our waiter was new or not very smart or both. I am gluten free so like bj's for the gf pazookie. I tried their mint chocolate martini after explaining to the server he could substitute the goose for kettle. It has been done. Kettle is a potato vodka not wheat. I sucked that drink down it was fabulous! My husband ordered a delicious chicken rice and zuchinni meal. I ordered a soup and salad. No go on the tortlilla soup it was gross. Being a bartender I dont like dirty glasses and dishes on my table. There was no prebussing. Martini glass and dishes remained on table entire meal. Took a long time for food to come out. My whole family finished their meal before I even had a spoon for my soup. Waiter kept trying to joke about his crummy service. He never refilled our tea glasses, dirty dishes, food not right and kept forgetting to check back!  I joked back and said the gluten free pazokie should make up for all the bad things. It did indeed.

Robyn H.,"Houston, TX",4,80,35,2.0,1/8/2012,"Unfortunately I've had better experiences at other BJ's than the experience at this location. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress was attentive (it wasn't the service or restaurant that was the issue), but it was the food that was sub-par for what I am used to from BJ's. First, our salads arrived before the appetizer (minor inconvenience and easily overlooked). For an appetizer we ordered the potato skins. There was barely any cheese on them. I'm used to the nice cheesy cast-iron skillet of potato skins and apparently they've changed them to be more 'fancy'. This means they arrive nicely organized on a white plate with barely cooked bacon and no cheese. The ones with cheese tasted okay, but really the rest I took home so that I can add more cheese and eat them later. My Parmesan chicken was all right (the chicken was cooked nice and tender), but the pork chop my husband ordered was like one of the those fake plastic food items you find in kids play kitchens. It was really thin and came with only 4 small red potato halves. Next time we'll avoid the pork chop.

I came here to have drinks and dinner w/ a friend and while eating at the table I looked down to see a roach crawling on the top of the table near the attached wall. I was absolutely revolted, I couldn't eat any more, I called the hostess who was closest to me for her to see this and she said she would get the manager. Another 3 mins later the waitress came and said the manager was coming, and she was going to see if he was taking something off the bill. After another 4 mins of waiting the manager came over to apologize and said they spray often but sometimes the roaches still come out of the wood. He didn't offer to take care of anything on the bill even though we were clearly revolted. I paid my tab and went somewhere else for dessert.

Isabel C.,"Houston, TX",178,96,17,3.0,1/9/2014,"We decided to go to BJ's for a co-worker's going-away luncheon. The invitation ballooned and what was originally a 12 person lunch turned into a 20 person lunch.  The staff at BJ's was very accomodating and they moved us over to a small area off to the side and one of the managers stepped up to help take orders and move the dining experience along. It only took 1.5 hours from seating to paying the bill, which for such a large party is a great feat.  Although the service was really good, I can't say that the food was any sort of spectaular, which is what holds my rating back. I ordered the Half sandwich, half soup + fries.  The California Chicken sandwich, which seemed to have an abundance of mayo on it, was decent. I enjoy a dollop of mayo to add some fatty goodness; however, I don't enjoy having globs of it spilling out onto my plate and my fries.  The chicken noodle soup was akin to what I could find in a can, but it still hit the spot and expectations. The chose the shoestring potato fries because I like the crispiness to starch ratio. They were well-cooked, but underseasoned. All-in-all it was an enjoyable dining experience and I appreciate the staff at BJ's for being able to handle our seemingly ever expanding party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=180

Rachel B.,"Houston, TX",445,193,103,3.0,12/16/2012,"I'm really torn on my feelings about this place. I tend to frequent here with friends who live in the area because it's  well known landmark in the Willowbrook area. The menu is really hit or miss. Must try: Any type of pizza and the southwestern spring rolls.  Not to try: California chicken sandwich and pretty much any pasta dish.  The real reason I allow myself to meander through their heavy double doors is for the beer.  It is nice to go to a chain and find an exciting beer menu. The Hopstorm IPA is a personal fav.  If you happen land one of their few and far between ""good"" waiters then I would advise you to pick their brain about what you should choose. Had a lovely girl give me a run down on the list. Much appreciated ma'am. Waitstaff here makes me a touch mad. On 2 separate occasions I have had just bazaar incidents happen with different waiters. One man took 20 minutes to run my credit card on a very slow night. Second was someone who wasn't even waiting our table who delivered the food by slamming it down without a word and walked away. Rude. I've been told there is a waiter here that looks exactly like Obama.

Samir N.,"Royal Oak, MI",219,472,1,2.0,10/11/2013,"For a chain, the beer actually has flavor and is not different colored versions of the same watered down stuff.  They had lots of TVs everywhere to catch Sunday football, but they were all along the outside walls so you had to contort yourself or strain to see them.  Is this a Willowbrook thing?   I also tried the pizzookie - vanilla on chocolate.  It did not meet my [overly high] expectations.  By the time I finished my beers, the check came out.  I guess the waiter did not want me ordering other beers (they had non-BJs beer that I would have liked to try).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-houston?start=180

Ashley W.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,2.0,5/20/2015,"We loved going to BJ's where we used to live and decided to give this one a try since it was close to our house. We won't make that mistake again.  First, we asked for a booth and were told very matter of fact by the hostess that there were no booths available. Umm.. we spotted 2 open and we were being seated immediately upon walking in so we know they were not already designated for another table. I'm assuming they needed us to sit in someones section to balance out the servers tables. Not my problem.  Second, we end up sitting at a regular table and not making a fuss even though we can still see the two open booths. But the real problem began when our waitress introduced herself. She was as the lady behind me said, ""sour.. that's girl is just sour! No smile, no manners, just here's your food now can you pay?"" Lady, I couldn't have said it better myself.  I worked in retail in college.. I know what it's like to work with the public. You catch more bees with honey than vinegar. The final straw was the mix up on our food. My husband ordered a salad to come out before his meal. 25 minutes after ordering... here comes our meal. No salad. So he stops another server because of course we can't find ours and the guy disappears. Here comes the hostess asking what type of salad it was.. 10 minutes later, meals are finished.. here comes the waitress asking what kind of salad it was? No I'm sorry.. No discount on our meal.. Nope. Just some lousy excuse that it was put in a to go box and misplaced. Okay. Sure. Not buying this excuse. Just own up to forgetting to put it in for the order.

Hilary A.,"New Orleans, LA",129,150,76,3.0,12/22/2010,"I went here for lunch with two friends today, a Wednesday around 11:30. The parking lot was packed! I had no idea it would be so crowded.  When we went in, the hostess and the other people at the host stand ignored us; finally, a waiter addressed us (after looking around, wondering why no one else was). We were seated right away, and the hostess turned the menu to the lunch menu for us. When our waiter came, he told us he was sleepy. Awkward. I asked a question, and he answered it equally awkwardly, then walked away to serve another table. Yikes.  I ordered a caesar salad and half a ""giant stuffed baked potato"" (which cost me $9 including 20% tip). The salad portion was very good and tasted and looked fresh. I asked for the baked potato to be loaded but without sour cream. They brought me butter with chives in it? That seemed strange to me. The baked potato also had way too much cheese on it (it was covered!), and just looked generally unappetizing. One friend ordered the chicken fingers and had plenty left over. The other friend had a salad and the broccoli cheddar soup, which she complained was almost too stringy (melted cheese) to eat.  I've been to this restaurant at this location before, but not in awhile. I recall having a better experience in the past, and would also recommend the pizzookie.
