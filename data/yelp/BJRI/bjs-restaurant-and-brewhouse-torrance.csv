Pat L.,"Torrance, CA",69,46,172,3.0,1/20/2017,"If you're super hungry and want super fast service..... then this is not the place for you. If you're willing to wait like 40 minutes to an hour for your food to be served... then go for it! I came here with my friend and we were super hungry. We waited like 45 minutes for our food to be served. There weren't much people when we came but it took really long for our food to come.  FOOD: -We got the Chicken Alfredo, which was the bestselling pasta according to our server, and the deep dish Ziti. They were pretty good but the Chicken Alfredo was a bit dry.  -We also got a Spicy Pig pizza and I really liked it. It had bacon so........ of course it's good lol. SERVICE: -Our server was really nice although she was quite busy and hard to find so you really have to be patient when you eat at Bj's.  Overall, I give it three stars because of the slow service. I would've given more stars if it wasn't for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=40
Leslie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",345,195,145,5.0,11/30/2016,"This BJ's is nice. Its located in the heart of the Del Amo Mall! You could kill a date in one place!! BJ's is really clean, roomy, and a great environment to have any kind of parties. The bathrooms are really nice and clean. Today my waitress was Angela. She is a fellow Sagittarius like me so I knew she was going to be great. I had the spinach dip, fries, two shots, and one drink and everything was wonderful. Angela was very nice, kind, and took our order and made anything wonderful. Ofcourse i received the famous Bazooki and ice cream and the cookie was soft and ice cream perfect.

Chris I.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",4,45,2,2.0,8/15/2017,"I was torn whether to give this place a 2 or 3 star rating- Service- Pleasant and attentive Sante Fe Salad- I have had a version of this salad several times at other places and have always really liked it.  However, this salad sucked.  It had very little flavor.  Ate about half of it and left the rest to be thrown away. Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger with Sweet Potato Fries- This was pretty good and I would recommend it.  Had a good BBQ flavor to it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=40
Lidia A.,"Gardena, CA",103,2,,1.0,12/26/2017,"The worst customer service I have ever encountered. I was immediately met with a rude hostess who apparently had a bad day and decided to take it out on me and my companions. I had two children with me who were looking forward to eating pizza here and wanted to eat pizza from BJs. The manager was called and handled it in a mediocre manner. Then to undermine the situation, the manager decided to have a ""talk"" with the hostess, but instead they laughed in an overt manner.

I am writing this review from a different restraunt nearby, because my wife and I just watched two innings of baseball from our table without even being greeted by a server.

The Asian chopped salad was delicious. It was on the light menu but didn't lack any flavor.  I ordered an order of the wings and they were yummy! The waiter was pretty good .

Claudia V.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,5,1,1.0,6/2/2017,"Not one of my greatest experience there. Server (Richard) was kind of friendly ""I guess"" the food came right after the appetizer. Didn't get my salad before. Prime rib was sold out so I got another steak. When I asked for the dessert the server said if didn't came with it. I order a new dessert and it took almost 15 min to get it. I went to the front and and asked for my check and Cancelled the dessert the manager said oh! Ok! And she did. I had seen her before but not once the manager on duty approached our table to ask if everything was ok.

Razi S.,"Torrance, CA",55,82,36,5.0,5/10/2017,I love this restaurant every time I stop by it is always a great experience. The menu is like a book and anything you order will taste amazing. My wife and I come here when we need a break from the kids and it is always nice night. The last two times we came here we had the same server he was awesome and super nice. For dessert we got the 3 mini Pazookie combo they were all out of mini plates and they brought up regular size Pazookie. My wife and I could not believe our eyes. That was a great night I don't think i will forget that anytime soon.

We were told we had to wait 20minutes for a table but only took five. Both servers we had were really attentive, kind and a delight to be around.

Jasmine S.,"Gardena, CA",4,86,63,1.0,10/9/2016,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here because Buffalo Wild Wings had a long wait. We sat in the bar section in a booth and our waiter was great. We order the buffalo and root beer barbecue wings (boneless & bone-in) which was okay, nothing spectacular. We order the five meat pizza, which was AWFUL!!! My boyfriend and I literally ate bread w/melted cheese and burnt ham! There was a pinch of marinara sauce on the pizza. This was the WORST pizza I have ever had in my life! For desert we ordered the trio poozike. We ordered the oreo, chocolate chunk and monkey bread. The chocolate chunk and oreo poozkie was amazing. The monkey bread had NO taste! We didn't taste any cinnamon or brown sugar. We practically ate baked bread with vanilla ice cream. We should have never left Buffalo Wild Wings.

After twenty minutes, it is asked why the delay and why others are being seated. They stated they were preparing a table up front since a few people have walkers in the group. Fine, it is what it is. But then they sit another group at that table! After concern was raised again, everyone is escorted to the table in the far back corner!

When we complained about it he just microwaved it and bought back??? We denied for that microwaved pizza and asked for new one. New pizza was again cold and stale.  Their cloth napkins were black, I don't prefer black napkins, can't even check if it's clean or not... Burger was mediocre, just warm, we asked for ketchup they took forever to get that.

Stefan helped us during a busy day during one of the Dodger games!  He was super friendly, welcoming, and attentive. His personality is amazing!

Never let the drinks run low and made sure we were comfortable.  The food is not bad. I like the Ahi Tuna Salad. Happy hour is great for beers and munchies!

Our wait was about 40 to get a table for 2 people ok I understand that it's Sat night, but after that went down hill. Waited for 20 min just for someone to take our drink order which was a regular water nothing special and a drink from the bar after 10 min I got my drink, my husband's water nope took another 35 min to get his water.       Now mind you when we places our drink order we also placed our appetizer order, and our main course order which was a med well steak and hubby ordered the prime rib special which came with one of there cookies (I will get to that later). Then we got my main course first no appetizer nothing, my steak was cold like it was sitting around for awhile plus it was cooked rare. Then we got the appetizers which were also cold but somewhat editable, then we got our soup and salad, which was once again cold and cheese was on hubby salad he's alligeric to loactace so no cheese so he couldn't  eat the salad we told them that when we ordered the salad. Still no main course for hubby when we finally got it it was cold and oversalted, so we called our waiter over who then called who we thought was the manager Mario nope not the manager said ok Your whole meal is on us because we couldn't eat it then changes it to ok you have to pay for the appetizer and my drink ok fine just give us the check and cookie to go,      Nope cookie came to the table not in a to go box but at least  the right cookie, when we told Mario of the mistake we ordered the cookie to go he brought it out in a bag should of looked at the cookie before we left, we got in the car and they gave us the wrong cookie.

Thankfully the manager answers, we tell hey the problem, she checks with our server Kayla, and Voila! The debit card is safe, the manager will even let us come get it right then and there. I commend the honesty, integrity and helpfulness of both of these women! BTW, the HAPPY HOUR $3 Sriracha Queso is FIRE!!! SO good!

Shelby J.,"Lakewood, CA",45,149,485,2.0,8/3/2017,"Well I will start this review off by saying I'm totally biased against BJ's. After shopping around through Del Amo Fashion Center, my sister was craving a pizookie and was ordering takeout. For some odd reason I can't imagine WHY the restaurant was so overly crowded that night so the restaurant handed out free deep dish pizza to the parties waiting, including myself. I dunno if I was just really hungry or they were having an exceptionally good night, but that night the pizza was so good! It was so good that I decided to give BJ's another chance despite the bad experiences I've had in the past, but sadly to say I was disappointed yet again.  This location is always crowded. Like always! I strongly suggest you have a snack or walk around the mall while you're waiting to be seated.. Our waitress wasn't really the best. She wasn't necessarily good or bad. Just kind of like whatever. The food matched her performance. I ordered their boneless chicken wings and deep dish pizza. Both were highly disappointing. The chicken was dry and just nasty. It tasted like frozen chicken they just warmed up in a toaster oven. The pizza was okay. It wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the money they charge for it in my opinion. I will never go back to BJ's again. The food is just nasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance

Mark M.,"Torrance, CA",36,335,1093,4.0,7/24/2017,"Torrance Food Crawl #245 BJs is located at the far east end of the Del Amo mall so its a convenient place to visit before or after a movie at the nearby theatre. I was here for a late lunch and there were plenty of seats available in the restaurant. Rather than go for one of the lunch items I went for the New Orleans Jambalaya. It wasn't quite as good as jambalayas I've had in New Orleans, one of my favorite cities to visit, but reaching that level of cajun food quality is hard to achieve. There was shrimp (good), chicken (didn't leave any impression), and andouille sausage (very good with a nice mild spice taste). It also contained red and green peppers (crunchy and good), tomatoes, and onions (perhaps too much in the way of onions). These were found on a bed of rice pilaf which came out very nice. Perhaps not the best jambalaya I've had but it was pretty good.  Service was prompt and attentive.

Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,9/22/2017,"Well, unfortunately, BJ's lack of QA has reared its ugly head again.  After experiencing the best experience ever at a BJ's in Montebello, we just experienced one of the worst. The hostesses were pre-occupied with gossip vs. patrons.  We actually stood there and observed two hostesses converse about their private lives while we are literally three feet away wanting to get seated.  Finally, they took notice of a line building up and we finally got seated.  Rule one, keep your personal life at home and do not bring it to work.  Seriously. Once seated we ordered our appetizer.  Needless to say, it was not cooked all the way through.  How can you not cook mushrooms thoroughly.  One of the simplest things to do.  Needless to say, our waitress was clueless when we asked her to take them back for fresh ones and could not understand wy we would want a fresh batch.  I told her, feel it, it is stone cold. Needless to say, we got the good old fashioned roll of the eyes thrown our way.  She did not say a word and took the dish.  Someone else brought out a new dish and no words were spoken.  It was like the show' Westworld'  all robots but these robots are not thinking about the client and the client experience. We got our salads at the same time we got our food when we distinctly asked for the salads before the meal.  Very disappointed as our food was getting stone cold as we had our salads. So, our waitress never came back to give more water or ask if we wanted a refill on our beverages.  AWOL.  All I can say is that the food was not edible as it was stone cold.   We asked them for the Prime Rib sandwich a certain way.  It was not even listened to, as it came the way it would normally.  We waited for the waitress to make the orders right, however, she was staying away at a bigger table and we were just forgotten about in the corner booth. Needless to say, this location failed at all levels.  First impressions were a zero, the waitress was a zero and the food was a zero.  All of this could have easily been avoided if people just did their job.  Nothing fancy, just do your job and who knows how it would have turned out. We wanted to take advantage of Pizookie special, however, our waitress was AWOL and we did not want to waste any more time in a place that did not care about us this day.  Get Montebello to train your staff, Kristian in Montebello knows how to be an AWESOME server!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance

Food choices during happy hour is pretty good too. All appetizer plates, shareable flatbreads and buffalo wings are $2 off. We got the calamari and margherita flatbread. Both were very delicious and enough for the two of us to share for happy hour! Both plates are approximately $11.50 regularly with $2 off for happy hour.

Before I left the house, I used the bj's app to put my name on wait list. Once we got there, I went to desk to mention my name on wait list. Then we waited 10-15min for table and sat in a dimly lighted booth. Everyone had to use their flashlight on their cellphone to read the menu. The funny thing is the specials for that night was pork chops and 3 family members wanted pork chops and the waitress said no pork chops that night so they were highly disappointed. This is why I gave 2 stars if they don't have pork chops then don't promote it on the menu. The waitress was good on refills but busy with other tables. I wish the booth wasn't so dimly lit.

We haven't been to BJ's in years, and since AMC was practically next door (a few steps away, upstairs), it couldn't get any more convenient!  Got my usual Hef. Hubbers got his brewski as well (forgot what he got.)  Whoa, their food menu is extensive! It took us a few minutes to read through everything!  We agreed to start our meals with their honey sriracha Brussel sprouts and spinach stuffed mushrooms.  The only teenee issue I have with the Brussel sprouts, really, is that a couple of them weren't cooked through - still edible, though. The honey sriracha wasn't overpowering and the seasoning was nearly perfect. I didn't really get a good taste of the spinach with the mushrooms. The pesto sauce came off a bit strong but didn't really do any overpowering. We really liked this also.  I had the lunch portion spaghetti and meatballs while Hubbers got the fish and chips with the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad.  The spaghetti and meatballs were nothing to scream about. It was average, the typical spaghetti you get from mediocre Italian restaurants. I should have asked for fresh grated mozzarella and black pepper because that might have made a difference. It was okay, though.  Hubbers enjoyed his fish and chips. The salad is pretty much a caprese. We shared it and the key to that entire thing was the balsamic vinegar dressing. I could have had that as a meal!  Service was above mediocre level. Nothing to complain about on that department.  We noticed their ""MOVIE AND A MEAL"" ad. I asked about it and movie tickets were only $9/each (given that you dine there, of course.) So, Hubbers and I scored on that!

Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3210,1017,9804,5.0,6/13/2017,"I think the service speed has definitely improved a lot lately, sometimes we choose to sit at one of the booth seatings in bar area, it's easier to watch sports and the servers always come by faster than regular seatings.  This restaurant is a brewery too that's one of the reasons we love to frequent this place, I love their handcrafted brews like berry cider, piranha, Jeremiah red and stout. Also the Chicago style deep dish pizzas are just too delicious and they even have gluten free choices. Extensive menus with yummy small plates and light items are perfect for light meals, pizzas, burgers and wings are great for watching sports. Other favorites are Sriracha brussel sprouts, tuna poke, clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, jumbo spaghetti with meatballs, jambalaya and super salad with blackened salmon. They have Happy hour Monday - Friday from 3-7pm, Sunday- Thursday from 10- close at bar dining area, Tuesdays half off wines on glasses and bottles. Don't forget about the pizookies that's one of the best desserts out there. And they make very strong and refreshing Grey Goose martinis that I love to have as my non sweet ""desserts""!  Absolutely our favorite go to chain restaurant in the neighborhood, can't beat the food and drinks at both prices and portions! They sell their own canned brews at the restaurant ""to go"" area that we like to grab a few to take home after our meals here or whenever we do take outs, it's quite convenient for a beer lover like me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance

We all waited about 15-20 minutes and we all got our food except my boyfriend. Didn't think anything of it because it was ribs- thought it just took longer to make. I asked our server where his food was and she apologized and said it was coming. She came back to tell us ""the food wasn't made properly"" and suggested we ""reorder the food"". Then came back out and asked him what sides he ordered. Obviously she forgot to place his order. 35 minutes pass and STILL no food. I asked her again and even asked our food runner- ""it's coming"".  It got to a point where it was getting intolerable and I asked to speak to a manager. He apologized and said he would take care of his food. The server didn't even offer to comp his food after multiple times of asking her where the food was.

It's a pretty good sports bar as well with a very cool bar area with lots of screens everywhere, even the large dining room. The place feels like a secret lair, or a private cave, both in a good way. It's an upscale place for a fair price. My favorite dish is the Lemon Thyme Chicken $12, lunch menu. It comes with brown rice and Brussels sprouts and grilled chicken. Absolutely deelish. It may be a little salty for some but low in calories. Always served promptly and hot. I've always enjoyed the food, and it's a GREAT place to watch NFL on Sundays. Here comes the negative ***MGMNT ARE YOU LISTENING?*** ... At least four times I left because no one approached me. Four times! Once I am greeted everything is fine from then on.

I visited family in LA and we thought we would go out for a quick bite to eat.  I didn't know what I really wanted, so my family recommended BJ's and I agreed.  I'd visited Torrance a few years back for a family reunion, so I was familiar with the area.   Ambience: This spot appears to be a place well liked by many.  The hostess station is up front and you have to put your name on the wait list to be seated. The wait was about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, very clean and there are tables for large and small parties.  The restaurant is not well lit so I had problems reading the menu.  Increasing the lighting would be beneficial for many.   Food: I decided to order the gluten free pizza. It was difficult because there was so much on the menu to choose from.  One family member ordered the bbq wings and the other ordered the deep dish pizza.  The pizza was excellent, the crust was thin and the cheese tasted great.   Service: Our server was extremely nice and very attentive.  He made sure our drinks were filled and made recommendations since it was my first time visiting.   Overall the food was good.  I will visit again during my next trip to LA.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=20

When I first started telling her what was going on, she hesitated to apologize and I could tell from the lull in her response that she was going to be an ASSHOLE. The pizza had already been paid for, the previous day and was at my house, at least 10 miles from there, no way was I going  to take it back. She asked why I didn't call yesterday when I realized the paper was there, how long did it take to realize that the paper was in it, who ate the pizza, why I didn't bring it back, she eanted pictures of the wax paper, she asked so many more questions until she caused me to hang up on her. All I wanted to do was make her aware of what was going on in the kitchen that she ""manages"".

I dont care for the mediocre customer service either.  Thought I'd order my nephew a quick pizookie on the way to picking up dinner at Outback's since I was a bit early. Negative! Sat at curbside calling the number on the sign repeatedly. After about ten minutes, I remembered I had the app and ordered online. Figured I'd pick up food and15 minutes would be enough time for a cookie to be done.  Not surprised when no one picked up the line again. After swveral tries, I googled the general restaurant number. Explained to Kiana that I had been sitting outside for the second time and no one was picking up the curbside line. This b**ch pauses for a minute then tells me it's probably because the other girl was making food in the back. Really smart ass?! If so, it's sad to say that there's ONE person making food, bringing it to cars, and answering the phone!! Luckily, the baby was in the car asleep because I would've been inside ready to snatch her up!  Anyhow, I got my cookie. The young lady was nice when she came out. I couldn't figure out how to pay for the cookie via the app because I had no table number. She showed me how to navigate through it and find my points as well.

The staff is friendly enough, but completely inept. No one knew what was in the Vegan soup (not vegan mind you, just like options) and the few servers I asked NEVER came back with an answer. They don't coordinate with each other, which did lead to a second free meal (that lack of coordination issue) but after about an hour of waiting for a simple bread bowl. They blame their co-workers or silently smile daggers trying to blame you for their inability to divide a cheque after we'd physically labeled who-got-what with a numeric key to make things easy on her. Don't go thinking it'll be fast to order or even get your check, even near closing time when you'd think everyone wants to leave. Alone or with a group, we are always seemingly forgotten. I've had servers spill on people SEVERAL times, at the start of the meal. If management is the reason I keep getting free desserts/meals, fine, but something bigger is going on. Maybe people aren't being paid well enough, or you're just hiring friends, or your staff isn't getting training. I don't know. The food is decent at best, but over priced, though I enjoy the pizookies well enough.

Not a big fan of deep dish pizzas, their pastas are whatever, and somehow their service always seems to be really slow. Today I tried something different: SEARED AHI SALAD: Baby field greens, napa cabbage, romaine, red bell peppers, tomatoes, avacado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, crisp wonton strips and green onions tossed with rice wine vinaigrette - I was quite impressed with their salad. The dressing was good and the seared ahi was okay too. But the salad's around $15 and I don't usually spend that much on salad. (The only reason why I tried it this time was because I had a BOGO entree coupon.) DEEP DISH ZITI: Penne layered with housemade meatballs, Italian sausage, pepperoni, Marinara and Italian herbs, finished with BJ's signature five cheese blend. Parmesan cheese and fresh basil. - Very cheesy, the way I like it. But not something I would want to pay $15 for again. The waitress today was very friendly. I was ready to leave great reviews about their service, but everything was TOO SLOW! It was lunch time, meaning, there are a good number of customers but the seats are not filled.

Unfortunately the lady who actually seated us looked and sounded less than happy to do so. But it was okay, fortunately our server for that night, Jeremiah, was great. He was super friendly and I felt very comfortable around him. (4 stars) I ordered the siracha and queso dip and chips as an appetizer for me and my friends. The chips were good, nothing amazing. However the dip was disappointing because it merely seemed like melted cheese with a bit of green onions mixed in. There was no siracha!  (2 stars) As for the food, I ordered a seared ahi salad. The ahi was clearly not seasoned well enough and it lacked flavor. Also, only a third of my plate was lined with ahi and I really wish I got more (2 stars). The avocado in the salad was a good balance to the very acidic, and probably too acidic, greens and dressing (3 stars). In conclusion the food was average, nothing too special.

Darian L.,"Torrance, CA",10,6,4,3.0,12/4/2016,"So stopping by around 9 pm on a Tuesday with a group of 4, the wait was around 30 minutes. (Reservations are for larger parties, but they will ""put your name down"" if you call ahead of time). On the plus side you can order drinks at the bar while you wait and they have some booths to sit at around the entrance. You should expect a dimly lit bustling atmosphere with the occasional slow service, but at least you have lots of time to find what you want through their delicious menu items. [   ]  BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza: $26.50 5/5 Safety Rating I'm pretty open minded when it comes to deep dish and pan crust pizza and I thought this was a pretty safe pick. BJ's Favorite in particular is one of their more popular ones so it must be doing something right. Eat it with people. Maybe 2-5 others to be safe (if you're alone it's okay, you can always take it to go friend). [   ] Brisket Burger: $12.95  4/5 Safety Rating Could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce, but maybe you like it that way.

Sandy M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",45,87,285,3.0,7/25/2017,"This was a very odd experience. While my phone showed the Wi-Fi was strong, I could not sign on to the internet & I could not use the app, that was my first annoyance. The waiter Steven was particularly efficient and polite. He brought my steak, which seemed really small compared the menu picture. I don't think the menu states how many ounces this cut is supposed to be. (I am missing my sirloin with the Outback being closed!)  Everything was prepared well and tasted good. Towards the end of the meal Steven came over to tell me that he was ""being sent home""(early) and introduce me to the next waiter that would take care of me, Josh. I could see the manager of the restaurant holding court across the aisle from me on a table with about 4 servers crowding around her. She seemed to hold up Josh for quite a while and then reminded him to come check all the customers he'd just acquired.  I'm glad that I could see that three-quarters of the meal had already happened when Steven left and I had grabbed a few bucks out of my purse to hand him some cash. All the cash I had was only $3 but I wanted him to not miss out on a tip. After that it took kind of a long time to get my iced tea refilled, get a to go container. and cash out my check. So one star deduction for manager drama and one star for the tiny steak.

My daughter got the Golden Beet and Arugula salad.  She loved the freshness and quality of the salad.  My wife usually orders that salad and loves it too. My wife and I shared the Garlic Chicken and Pesto Tavern Cut pizza.  I was disappointed in the pizza because only two slices (the ones in the middle) had any sort of toppings and freshness to them.  The rest of the slices were dry and minimal toppings.  The crust was dry and crunchy which was not tasty.  I prefer thin crust to thick crust when it comes to pizza but when you order these tavern cut pizzas it seems like you will only get two slices of pizza that have the toppings on them and can actually enjoy. The service was a bit slow too.  When we sat down in the bar area it took over 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and ask if we wanted anything.   Love the bar area.  Plenty of tv's with different college football games on.  That was enjoyable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=60
Scott S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",706,555,1887,3.0,1/3/2016,"The review I would give this restaurant is pretty much the same review that I would give to any BJ's location around the L.A., OC area. It is a large, well-designed space made up of a lot of booths and some tables. The food is as expected -- just like all the other BJ's. It is pizza based restaurant and is pretty good. In fact, I'm am a big fan of the various pizzas at BJ's. They do have other offerings but pizza is their primary focus and it has been my experience that is always the best choice when you eat here. They also have a nice selection of beers which, of course, go well with pizza.  As is the case with all BJ's the staff here is nice and friendly. How good your service will be is highly dependent upon who your server is.  Just like all the other BJ's this place can get very-very crowded.  When it is, expect a very loud and chaotic atmosphere. So, the best time to go is on the off hours.  In terms of food, this location offers a breakfast menu. The breakfast dishes are mostly pizza styled entrees. Which is the best way to go. They do have traditional Americana style breakfast; i.e.: eggs, bacon, and pancakes, but the one time I ordered this, my eggs arrived supremely cold. Not good! So, my suggestion is to stay with what BJ's does best, pizza style food.  This BJ's is right off of two large outdoor parking lots in the outdoor section of the Del Amo Fashions Center, so though these too can get full and crowded, parking is generally not too much of an issue.  Overall, BJ's is BJ's, eat here if you want some good pizza and beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=60

Steve N.,"Torrance, CA",955,942,1365,4.0,12/31/2015,"BJ's is always a nice place to stop in while walking through the Del Amo Mall in Torrance. There are definitely many options to choose from as you're walking through the outside area, but BJ's won't disappoint! You have your choice of sitting outside on the patio or inside where there are several booths and small seats in their bar area. This location is along the Del Amo mall on the Carson side right across from the Vegas seafood buffet. The wife and I come here at night after work to order some food and a flight of beers. If you like deep dish style pizzas, they serve a variety of different pizzas with sizes and toppings of your choice. The one thing I do suggest is to save some room for dessert, as they serve a warm cookie pizza (what they deem a ""pizookie"") with a scoop of vanilla/chocolate ice cream. It's honestly the only reason we try not to order too much food when we come here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=60

Jayson M.,"Hawthorne, CA",392,90,82,1.0,5/23/2016,"Came here for a late night snack since I just landed back from a long flight. Called at 11 regarding last calls which was 5 minutes before closing time. The employee on the phone was nice and she seemed well informed of their policy. Got there around 1115ish and asked for a table of two after waiting about 5 mins for someone to approach us. A man and woman walked up and told us the bar area was open, but we didn't want to sit at the bar so we asked if we can sit at a table. He then ignored our request and said the bar area is open? My friend and I was confused. We told them we called earlier. The guy proceeded to tell us the dining area is closed at 11, and the bar area is only open up until last call. Then he looked at the girl and they started to whisper something to each other and the girl looked confused. It was pretty awkward for us standing there while they whispered to eachother. I feel like the girl wanted to seat us in the dining area, but the guy didn't. I didn't want to make it a bigger issue than it was so I just decided to sit at the bar area to find an open table and to our convenience, all the tables were dirty, but he called someone over to clean it pretty quickly. seated and ordered right away with Raymond. He didn't seem too enthusiastic while taking us. We got the two for $25 deal which consisted of a pizza, pizookie, and soup or salad for us both. We asked to just make everything at the same time and just to bring out whatever came out first because we knew it was late. Raymond didn't really understand and kind of gave an attitude saying ""can I bring out the soup and salad first?"" And I kept repeating myself and he kept repeating himself lol. After the whole ordeal he understood. I just didn't want him to wait on us finishing our pizza to start making the pizookie since it was already 1130 and they close at 12.  Everything was fine except my Caesar salad. It was funny because there was literally only ONE crouton on my salad. (Refer to my picture) I was literally so baffled at how there can only be ONE crouton. And this was literally the cherry on top of everything that has unfolded so far. I was discouraged to eat it, but I just landed from a long flight and just ignored it. I was going to ask for some more croutons, but no one came around until the pizza and pizookie came out which came out at the same time which was perfect. At this point I just wanted to get out of there which I asked for the check when the pizza came. I paid right away, and tipped 40% of the bill just for my memorable bad experience.  Raymond peeped the tip amount after returning with a Togo box for the pizza. We could tell his mood changed and seemed a little more happy to serve us which he then offered another refill of lemonade lol. Don't wanna get into that. But yea left the establishment and looked around to see that we were not the last customer there. Yay. ANYWAYS! I wanted to inquire to management about what their policy was regarding their dining area hours for future reference, but I came to a conclusion that I just shouldn't come anymore. I was a server part time and understood everything that was going on. I would never treat customers any different even if they came in one minute before last calls.

What I liked most of BJ'S other than the pazookies was their beer selection... Not so much anymore. The first thing I noticed about the menu was that their beer list was significantly reduced. I found out from the bar tender that they cut down on their Belgium selection and are trying to promote their house beers.  The food is still the same...the pizza and pazookies are delicious no doubt about it. This time I ordered the Buffalo chicken pizza on a Flatbread style....the toppings are all centered leaving a big space on the outsides. Stick to the deep dish style.

The manager felt that because 50 alcohol drinks (2 rounds of drinks for the entire party) was excessive and did not allow us to order anymore drinks. We paid our tab and left.  We walked to another establishment to continue our party and the manager called that establishment to tell them not to serve us (which the employees informed us of this).  We went to a third establishment and the manager from bjs called them to say the same thing. The manager from third establishment spoke with us and flat out told us he got a call from the manager at bjs saying we were ""too intoxicated"". After speaking with us, the manager clearly could tell we were not ""too intoxicated"" and accommodated our party.

They past my quote time and I even reserved a table online. I finally get seated I didn't get serviced until 15 mins later. I finally got my food ordered and my entrees came out first before my appetizers. I asked the waitress how come my entrees came out first. She checks in the kitchen and comes out 7 mins later our appetizers. She apologized but then when we ate the food it was broader line warm to cold. It's just disappointing when they have this much staff and they are delivering cold food to paying customers when it expected to be hot. Later one of the food runner drops over calm Chowder at our table and we didn't even order it. The management really needs to train their employees getting wrong tables. They probably gave my food to another table. This is by far the worse I've experienced at the establishment. I came here for the pizookie but I feared by the time it came to me the ice cream would have melted or I would get it when the store closed. My advice don't come here during rushes. The waitress tried to fix it by comping out appetizers which I appreciated but then when our bill came there was added stuff. I told the waitress this was not what we ordered and again she apologized and gave us the correct bill. When we paid she came and apologized again and rang up the wrong table.

Brian S.,"North Tustin, CA",250,366,881,2.0,10/11/2015,"Been here 4 or 5 times, most of those were in the bar, a couple were in the dining room. Usually service is not bad, especially in the bar.  Food and beer are decent, as anyone who's been to BJ's before is probably familiar with.  The dining room is another matter.  Today (10/10) went for a family birthday gathering with 4 adults and 2 kids which was not very good.... Called ahead to get on the ""priority seating"" list which really means nothing.  All that it means is that if you get there and check in at the same time as another party of 4 that didn't call ahead, you'll be one ahead of them on the list.  They told us it would be 20 minutes when they handed me the pager, which then took 50 minutes.  I don't mind a few extra minutes while a table is cleared, but that was pretty rough. We were then seated and it took a little while for someone to bring our drinks.   Appetizers came out a reasonable time after, but both were below average in quality and appearance, which was surprising, because I dine at BJ's at a regular basis and I know what to expect.  Also didn't look anything like the menu. Ordered our entrees while waiting for appetizers.  Food took a while, but then came out and tasted pretty good and was reasonably hot.  Was definitely a notch above the mediocre appetizers.   However, wait staff refilled drinks once and acted like we were troubling them to get anything (water, sugar for tea).  Also took about 15 minutes to clear dirty plates. Near the end of the meal, brought wrong dessert 15 minutes after ordering.  After informing them, it took another 10 minutes to bring the right dessert. The worst part came as we were getting ready to leave.  It turns out halfway through our dinner, the table was cleared of 4 (unused) appetizer plates.  There was a birthday card (unopened) with a gift card inside which was a white envelope leaning against these plates.  Somehow, the plates and the envelope were swooped away at the same time.  Nobody noticed because we were busy trying to eat our food, have a conversation, and control two small kids.  But when we all got up to leave, we were surprised we didn't see it anymore, and nobody had grabbed it.  I was the last one to get up, reached back to pick up my wallet off the table and that was the only thing there.  5 minutes later, I realized nobody had the card, went back and there was no sign of the it anywhere - spoke to hostess, and all but the waiter said they didn't see it.  He said he'd noticed it earlier, but not later in the meal.  I talked to my family and we were all in disbelief and frantically trying to remember who saw it last, which was fruitless.  After attempting to get further clarification there was nobody else left to speak to in the restaurant, so I then left.  Essentially, all evidence suggests a worker picked it up with the plates and threw it away, or (worse) actually decided to keep it for themselves. Won't be back unfortunately, not just because of this incident but the food and service also.  Worst part is there wasn't even anybody to complain to or find out what was going on.  I was tempted to call the police, but out of sheer luck was able to resolve the issue on my own outside of the restaurant.  Will not recommend this location to anyone, as the wait here was horrendous (and got even worse after we arrived) and service / food just as questionable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=200
hao n.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/27/2016,"I decided to come here because I did not want Denny's again for a late mean after work at 930PM. So I called to make sure they were open, which they were and happy hour was about to start so why not.... I walked in and was not greeted by anyone, I had to approach someone to be seated. but because I asked about happy hour they pointed me to the bar area, so I walked over there. Seated myself for a few minutes. No one brought me a menu so I got up and grabbed one myself. After taking some time to look at the menu, I moved from a table near the bar to the bar itself because no one was coming to take my order.  I got to the bar, and was asked by the bartender about my order about 10 minutes after sitting down. I asked about happy hour again because I was unsure of it and she said no because it starts at 10, and its been 10 LOL. She told me its half off appetizers and pizza. So I order 2 appetizers to go. I got my bill and put my card in the cup. When I got the receipt back to sign and tip it was more than what I was expected. I asked the bartender for another pen because it was not working and I asked about my bill being higher than what I thought. She then said, ""oh sorry its actually half off pizza and $2 off appetizers.  I was going to change my order but I did not want to wait any longer. So I paid the price and took the $2 off, being ok with that because I am expecting and assuming great customer service form now on because of the miscommunication.  45 minutes pass by and I finally get my appetizers, but wait... She forgot my spinach dip, so that took another 10 minutes. About an hr later I was walking out the door hungry as a MUGAFUGA. They did not organize my carry out bag right so the containers began to fall over inside the bag. The frustration in building up. I got home, and relieved to eat. I opened my bag of food. And notice the special poke sauce for the ahi poke appetizer was not in the bag or poured on the ahi fish. That is the main part that makes it taste good........

Andrew H.,"San Francisco, CA",148,593,546,2.0,6/18/2015,"Overview: This BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is an upscale American restaurant that serves a variety of popular entrees such as steak, fish, pork chops, and both deep dish and flatbread pizza. Everything here feels generic, likely due to the breadth of the menu, and I feel like there's not really a ""signature"" dish even though on their menu many items say ""signature"" in the title. Yes, this is the home of the pizookie (large cookie with ice cream) but really... it's not that special. Expect to pay about $20 a person here with an entree, beer, and a shared dessert. The Establishment: Located in a beautiful outdoor mall in west Torrance with lots of parking lots surrounding the shops. Next to a P.F. Chang's along with assorted upscale department stores. Dimly lit, and decorated with upscale materials. No problems here. The Service: The chefs are quite quick, my server was ridiculously efficient in processing the bill, but I did notice a bit of ""attitude"" and impersonal behavior (looking away from you as they take your order) here. The Food: Here's why BJ's gets 2 stars. Let's use the pizza an example because it's the last item I ordered here and it's fresh in my mind. As of June, 2015, you'll pay $25 for a 14"" deep dish ""BJ's Favorite"" which is equivalent to any other pizza joint's ""the works"" or ""supreme."" What I received was lower quality than any Pizza Hut pizza I've had in the past 5 years. Spongy, stingy on the ingredients, uneven spread, hardly any cheese... why didn't I just pay half the price for a better pizza at my local take-out pizza chain?? I took a photo below of the nicest section of the pizza, but trust me, 1-2 slices were sparsely topped and the layer of cheese is quite thin (in my opinion). I must admit I've only been to BJ's about 3 times in the past and have tried their burger, their pizookie, one of their beers, and a pasta dish, and every time they've been more bland than the equivalent dish at a ""specialty"" place that concentrated on one genre of food. With such a wide menu, I understand why BJ's jack of all trades is a master of none. Conclusions: This BJ's is in a wonderful location and is decorated well, but it serves very middle-of-the-road food at inflated prices. I hope that in the future, the franchise owners chose to slim down their menu and concentrate on perfecting a few choice dishes rather than try to appease every potential customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=180
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,3.0,4/2/2014,"Let me make one thing clear: the food at this BJ's is great. It's comparable to any other BJ's location (if not better -- this location definitely does not skimp on ice cream served with the Pizookies). The lower star rating for this location is for service. On the majority of the times that I've visited this BJ's, the service was usually poor. For example, on my most recent visit, the server didn't even give our party (five people) enough table settings until we asked (repeatedly for it). We constantly had to ask for water refills and extra napkins. Upon (finally) taking our orders, the server only took the order of half of our party (it was only appetizers) and disappeared for a long time before coming back to our table to take the remaining orders. Perhaps it was to already put in some of the appetizer orders? I'm not exactly sure. That being said, we were clearly not done ordering (we ALL ordered appetizers) and he just disappeared midway through the process! All that aside, the food from BJ's is great and I always take out of town guests to the eatery. Of course, BJ's is known for its deep dish pizzas, but the menu contains other hidden gems. Some of my favorites are listed below.  ""Gourmet Mac & Cheese"": This is one of my favorite mac & cheeses. It can serve as an appetizer or as a meal for one. This creamy blend of rotelle pasta is combined with chipotle, garlic and three cheeses. It's topped generously with bacon bits and seasoned breadcrumbs to create a toasted, golden-brown crust.  ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"": One of the pre-set flavors on the deep-dish pizza menu, the ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"" is phenomenal. It includes applewood smoked bacon, Jack and Cheddar cheeses, grilled garlic chicken, red onions, diced tomatoes and ranch dressing drizzled on top. I love deep dish pizzas and this one is completely covered with chicken pieces, cheese and ranch dressing. It's definitely a great savory blend. ""Tuscan Chicken Limone"": If you're not in the mood for pizza, this is a good pasta option. ""Tuscan Chicken Limone"" comprises angel hair pasta (one of my favorite types of pasta) and pieces of chicken sautéed with garlic and topped with artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, freshly steamed baby spinach and soaked a lemon butter sauce. Two pieces of cheesy garlic bread also accompany this entrée.  ""Chocolate Chunk/Peanut Butter Pizookie"": Did you know that you can get half of one cookie flavor and half of another in ONE Pizookie? Just ask your server! My default dessert choice is a Pizookie with half ""Chocolate Chunk"" (a cookie generously loaded with milk chocolate chunks) and half ""Peanut Butter."" The Pizookie comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's best when the server brings the Pizookie warm (like fresh-out-of-the-oven warm). It'll be a race against time to keep up with the melting ice cream! ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"": To my knowledge, this is the most recent addition to the Pizookie menu, and it's a great salty-sweet combo. While some of the Pizookies are on the sweeter side, this one's blend of flavors result in a moderately sweet dessert. This Pizookie features a caramel cookie with pretzel bites and dark and white chocolate chips. It's topped with caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and a Ghirardelli Squares dark chocolate. On my most recent visit, I gave up my default dessert (see above) to try this new ""Salted Caramel"" option and I was not disappointed. The caramel cookie was soft and chewy, and I loved the texture of the chocolate chips and pretzel bites within. The cookie itself was hot (so the ice cream was melting at an incredibly fast rate), but it wws definitely fresh and the chocolate and caramel were just oozing all over.  ""Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie"": I only ordered this Pizookie once, but it was a delicious one ... chocoholics will surely be pleased with this choice. This Pizookie includes a rich, chocolate cookie with the distinct taste of Oreos. It's topped with three (small) scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of creamy mousse. I especially loved the dark chocolate cookie served in this dessert ... it's moist, rich and simply to die for.  All in all, BJ's provides delicious American cuisine, and when there are specials (especially the lunch ones), the prices are reasonable. I like the eatery itself well enough, and the Pizookie desserts (every one that I've tried so far) are phenomenal. But if you're looking for stellar service, this location isn't the best one to visit. You'll have better luck at other locations like the Culver City or Brea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=180
Clark B.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",259,235,430,4.0,6/9/2016,"Spicy Brussel Sprouts from BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. This place is never going to ""Wow"" you but they have a huge menu and some tasty dishes. I'm impressed how busy this place was at 11pm at night. Almost full in the bar area. So they are doing something right. Love the bar setup with the huge TV. Good beers on tap. Love the Avocado Spring Rolls and the Sante Fe Spring Rolls. Both dishes are perfect Bar food. Lots of flavor. The Spicy Brussel Sprouts not as good. It's so hard to make Brussel Sprouts taste great. The Ratio of good dishes here are low but they take the Cheesecake approach and give every option possible. You did catch more fish with a huge net. They also dominate in the Del Amo area.

On my most recent visit, I saw they took away the bruschetta that was like $5. I used to always order that. Their happy hour prices for drinks are a steal. I came after a movie and saw their HH prices for a mojito was $4! I had two regular mojitos and the first one I finished under 10 min. However, the second one it was more of a struggle to drink. Not sure why. It might've been stronger. I wasn't particularly hungry so I shared the carnitas fries. It was good but after a little bit it was difficult to finish.  I got a chocolate chip cookie pizookie for dessert. I think my food combo was upsetting my stomach cause after the pizookie my stomach was so full but in a hurting way. I think the carnitas fries had too much going on for my tummy to handle, so to add dessert was a bad idea.The next morning wasn't pretty. I would still come back for HH drinks though.

Amber L.,"San Pedro, CA",573,330,7124,4.0,1/24/2015,"Each time I've come to BJ's, it has been a pretty good experience. I'd have to say that the worst was some months back when I called to make a reservation and the hostess took the reservation and confirmed the time of 7pm. Here's the problem...we get to the restaurant in time for our reservation and the hostess tells us that they don't take reservations. I told her that we called and made a reservation. Surprisingly she admitted to being the one that I talked to. She said it wasn't a reservation, but just being put on the wait list. Well even though I was pissed about that, I figured I could go ahead and wait a little bit, but when she told me that the current wait was at least 45 minutes, My irritation finally surfaced. I told her that she should have told me that they don't take reservations when I called. She should have explained this wait list crap. When someone calls requesting a reservation, their expecting exactly that. To my surprise, she apologized and put us as next to be seated. That was the last time that I came, but I figured I'd give it another shot. Fast forward to last night, some coworkers and I went for dinner and drinks. We were immediately seated and served by Chazz! He was absolutely awesome! He was patient with us, because we did take awhile before we ordered appetizers because we were so busy talking and he helped us with our drink orders. Most of us ordered beers, but me and another friend ordered ciders. She got a cider and beer mix and I couldn't decide, so Chazz told me that he could bring me samples of the ciders on tap. That was awesome, because I had no idea that you could sample it first. He brought me a sample of the berry and pear ciders. Both were really good, but I chose the berry. Here's the other thing...I'm not a big drinker, especially with beer, but Chazz told me that they have small glasses that are the size of the cider samples that he brought out to me, only their filled up. Perfect! And they were around $2.00 for that small glass.  We orderes various appetizers: The hot and spicy chicken wings that come with a side of wing sauce and ranch dressing. They were good, but the problem is that in the picture, they are completely coated with wing sauce. When we got them, they were bare, with light drizzles of wing sauce, so all of us were trying to coat our wings with that little side of sauce. #irritating! The small starter salad: The Golden Beet and Arugula Salad is made with diced golden beets, arugula, and red onions tossed in a strawberry goat cheese vinaigrette and topped with goat cheese, toasted almonds, and dried cranberries. I can tell you that I am one person who hates beets, but because I know that their really good for you, I make myself eat them or have it in a smoothie (a la Whole Foods). This salad however surprised us all! It was freakin delicious!!! It was a small one-person salad, but we all took some bites of it. After eating the golden beets, I now know that it's red beets that I don't like, because the golden ones were mild and delicious!  The crispy fried artichokes were lightly breaded and fried artichoke hearts sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with lemon garlic aioli. They were okay...kind of small, not the biggest amount of flavor, but I'd probably try them again. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were also an okay dish. They are mushrooms filled with spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, herb bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and topped with a lemon pesto sauce. They probably would have been better if the mushrooms were bigger. These were literally bite sized, so you didn't necessarily taste all of the ingredients that are supposed to be in it.  The corn fritters with bacon aioli were little balls made with jack and cheddar cheeses and jalapeños, breaded and lightly fried. They serve it with tangy bacon aioli, smoked bacon, corn and green onions. Another okay dish, but I think I need to try it again.  As Daniel W said, BJs is located at Del Amo Mall where there's plenty to do. It's on the outside of the mall with a movie theatre and bowling alley upstairs. If you get there early enough, you can all shop in some of the outside stores. And whatever you do, don't forget to get a pizookie for dessert at the end of your meal...hell, even first!

Christina Jane S.,"Hawthorne, CA",126,110,98,3.0,6/5/2015,"Appearance: This BJ's is bigger than the one in Culver City. I like it better because each time I come in, I can easily get a seat. This time I went in for dinner and sat at the bar and it was very clean.  Food/Drinks: I ordered a Jeremiah Red and a Caesar salad to start. There were a little too many croutons in my salad for me, but it was still pretty good. I also ordered a Buffalo Chicken pizza, Tavern-cut style. I feel like the ingredients were all centered and weren't as many on the edges of the pizza. When it came to pulling the side slices, it was a basically cheese flatbread. Service: We were instantly greeted by a bartender. She brought our drinks right away and was very diligent. She placed a napkin and utensil setups in front of us. The food runners were also very polite and thorough. They brought everything that we needed such as share plates and ranch when we asked for it. Because there was a birthday, the bartender ordered a birthday Pazookie for us. It came out in decent time, but as I was taking bites, I noticed it was under cooked. And it was definitely confirmed the next morning if you catch my drift. Overall Experience: I always go to BJ's for a Buffalo Chicken pizza and a beer. This was the first time I tried the pizza as Tavern-cut style. I would just prefer if they spread the ingredients out a little better. And I hope they get better about cookie their Pazookie more thoroughly.  I'll come back whenever I need my fix for this pizza again minus the Pazookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=180

Groovy G.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,28,60,1.0,6/25/2016,"BJs stands for BAD JOB! Ordered on-line, set up for curbside pickup at 6pm. I arrived at 6pm sharp to find NO curbside parking zone. WHAT? How can you advertise curbside? Decided to pull up in red zone, called the restaurant to discover they had no record of my order... Even though I had an email confirmation. I gave them the conf#, only to find out they can't use the number to pull up the order. That makes no sense! So, after listening to the Manager blame technology or operator error (me) I said clearly the error is not mine.. I have the conf#.  She offered to expedite my order so I placed the order for the deep dish my son wanted and one of their famous root beers. I live 20 minutes away and was only there bc my son really wanted BJs.  She then told me there are 3 designated parking spots in the lot (NOT curbside), when I kindly told her there are cars parked that haven't moved in the now 10 minutes, she told me to pull into the red zone. Hmmmm I waited and waited. Observed that the 3 spots never turned over AND a delivery man came out and hopped in his car, which was parked in a handicap space. SHAME ON HIM! I guess he felt his time was more important than someone's need for handicap parking.  Finally, 40 minutes After I first arrived, my pizza was brought out to me. I asked about the root beer and she told me they were out. WHAt? Why didn't they tell me that on the phone as I idled in the red zone? Their housemade root beer is delicious... How could they be out at 6:44 on a Saturday night? At last, I paid my bill before I lost my cool. NO concession was made for my lost order, the 40 EXTRA minutes I had to wait or for the lack of root beer. No discount, no coupon, no here's a free cookie.... NOTHING!  Why do you offer online ordering if it doesn't work? Why do you offer curbside when there is no such thing available? And why would you make a gesture that my time mattered and you want me to return some day. Btw, if someone orders something on the phone and you are out? TELL THEM... Don't wait til the very end.

Christine L.,"Torrance, CA",50,147,310,1.0,9/1/2014,"Have been here a hand full of times and each time I manage to get stuck with some waiter who doesn't seem to care. Normally I wouldn't leave a bad review for restaurant service because I get it, sometimes you just have a bad day and it is what it is; but at this particular location I've had 3 separate incidents where the waiter was for lack of better words...AWFUL. One can only assume that there is bad or lacking management in place?  My most recent incident was just last week. I got stuck with some waiter who must have judged me right off the bat. It was just me and my young 4 year old son. We were on a mommy and me lunch date. I don't know if he just saw us and thought automatically that I was going to leave a lousy tip or what....he blew me off multiple times, I called for him as he walked by and he just kept walking. I ordered some appetizers, my meal and my son's meal and then a meal to go for my husband. He only brought out my appetizers and put in my meal and my husbands as ""to go"" when I made it clear I only wanted ""one to go"".  He was just beyond a hot mess. I clearly was so frustrated that a young lady, she must have been a supervisor or asst. manager spotted me and came to my rescue. I handed her my card and paid for my tab. I just wanted out of there. He had the audacity to come back after I paid and brought me my check. HA! I paid already , just please get me my boxes.  I normally leave $20 tips no matter what the bill...but I made it clear by writing on the receipt ""Worst service EVER"" and left him a $10 tip only so he could see that if thats how much he got as a half assed server how much more would I have tipped if I had actually been happy.

Brian R.,"Torrance, CA",62,123,15,2.0,11/4/2014,"I was a bit disappointed here.  We brought a large group here and I was happy to since last time we went to Red Car Brewery, which isn't my favorite place to go with a small group and I heard good things about BJ's.  However, looking back, Red Car really made the experience much better for us and BJ's was not interested at all in doing the same. Came here with a large group (15) from work, which in retrospect was a mistake.  We had a reservation, which they told us we did not at first.  When we asked if we they could still accomodate us, they reluctantly said yes and then we got a little attitude.  Then they realized they did have a reservation and were actually just unprepared.  They offered us two options, one of which broke us up (which shouldn't have even been an option) and the other which was across a few smaller tables.  After being left to stare at the tables, we started moving then ourselves, which they eventually helped us set up, didn't give us enough seats (about 12).  We again had to take it into our own hands and make our room to seat the other 3. We were in a good mood from the prior event, so we were still optimistic it was the right choice.  The service from the waitress was prompt but with an attitude the whole time, especially to the person who eventually was taking the check.  He remained polite to her but was not happy.   We ordered a good amount of food, and when we ran out of room on the tables, we asked her to take empty plates that had been sitting there, which annoyed her. The food was pretty good and so was the beer.  The servings were a but small so we had to place a second round. Sliders - tender and pretty tasty Mozzarella sticks - pretty good Wings - pretty good Pizza - ok, but typical for Southern Cali.  More.chicago deep dish style Spinach Dip - pretty typical I forgot what else we got, but nothing to really write home about. For beer, their Red was really good, their stout tasted a bit flat, and a few people really liked their Blond Ale. Overall, probably ok place if you are at the mall and want to sit down with a couple buddies to watch the game.  Food is typical bar food that tastes like something you would buy in bulk at Sam's Club and warm up in oven.  Servings are pretty small and beer is pretty good because they have their own selection.  I doubt I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=220

I gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to give this restaurant a chance after the first and second time, but this is the final straw.  The first time I went here, my food took forever and when I finally received my pasta, it was so cold I didn't even eat it. The second time, service took forever as well (and no the restaurant was not busy). Finally, this 3rd and final time was he absolute worst.  At first we thought it would be a good time, and our appetizers rolled out quick but they tasted really shitty. The calamari was a little cold and the avocado egg rolls tasted sour. Then we put in an order for food at 10pm. Then 10:45 rolled around and we still haven't received our food. The two girls sitting next to us ordered two small pazookies the same time we placed our orders and they haven't received their food either. They began to get frustrated just as us. Once they noticed how pissed we were, they began to try to help us. So they brought out our two padinas but they didn't bring out fries with it because it wasn't ready for some reason. I mean, how long does it take to make fries??  Not to mention they didn't even bring out the pizza yet.  It was so bad that I will never come here again nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone. I will actually tell everyone I know to not go here.  I'm not sure what's the issue with this restaurant. I'm not sure if it's lack of personnel or just lack of quality workers, but they need to fix something here.  This was absolutely shitty.

We should all respect each other no matter what gender, race, or age. She really pissed me off! If the kids weren't with me, i would've said something to her. I shouldnt have given her tip at all!

Already feeling embarrassed bringing in her own food, when we went to order she asked for a plate and the waitress told us no. She said that she would get her manager to come over. Once the manager came over she explained that no outside food could be brought in because if she got food poisoning it could be blamed on BJ's... don't know how that would make sense. The manager finally came over and  handed her the plate and in a very rude response to my sisters kind ""thank you"" said ""mhm my pleasure"" but it was not sincere.

She finished her meal and told waitress she did not get her bread and asked my wife she would bring over bread.  What for? I told her she is done with her meal.  We used to be weekly customers but for a while now this BJ's service is terrible.  If you go here make sure you ask to be waited by Joe.  Just look next time you are there Joe is the one going back and forth servicing his customers and everybody else working at their own slow pace which is unacceptable....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=220

Of Course I was charged for the wrong order and the correct order which took forever to fix.

Kimberly C.,"Torrance, CA",310,399,2275,4.0,10/14/2013,"This BJ's always has good service whenever I'm here. Of course, on weekends and game nights there are big crowds, but I've never had an issue. My parents are big fans of the pizzas - BJ's Classic Combo and Sweet Pig are really tasty. The Grilled Burger Melt is my favorite when I'm craving a good burger; but my usual here is the Gourmet Mac and Cheese and Ahi Poke. They are both appetizers. but the two of them together makes for a great meal. I usually order the mac and cheese without the bread crumbs  because I find that its less dry and better tasting without it (and ask for some extra bacon pieces on the side! More bacon is always better!) The ahi poke is always really fresh with just the right amount of seasonings and has such great flavor. On my most recent visit, I ordered the ahi poke like normal, but instead of the mac and cheese, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and order something different: chicken wontons and spinach stuffed mushrooms. I wasn't happy. The chicken wontons (you only get three, which, even for an appetizer is rather small) were just not good. The chicken was really chewy and I didn't like how it tasted. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were okay, but the feta cheese was just too overwhelming. I won't order those again. But aside from my poor food choices, I've always had a nice dining experience here. The employees are all friendly and attentive. I will be here many more times in the future, I'm sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=220
Chisato A.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",147,37,22,1.0,12/22/2016,"Came here on a Wednesday night. The place was fairly busy due to holiday season. I went in to the restaurant around 9 PM with a group of friends to get a pizookie. They had a fair selection of pizookie and definitely recommend the trio pizookie if you are planning a visit there. You get to select 3 flavors from their selection (salt caramel, chocolate chunk, peanut butter smores, etc) and comes in a fairly decent size for the price. However, the cookie was too sweet and the texture wasn't consistent. Some parts of the cookie were hard and some were gooey. In addition, table service wasn't on par for what we paid at the restaurant. The waiter rarely comes by and never checked in on us to see how we were doing. When we asked for our check, the waiter just gave us a crumpled receipt from his pocket (no folder to put in cash/credit card what so ever). At the end of our stay we had to stand up and go to the cashier to pay for our dessert. I feel that this is a place that you can hang out with a group of friends after a long day of shopping and do not want to go elsewhere. Otherwise, I would say go to a place where the server will actually give you attention and proper service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=220
Harmonie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",262,873,2920,3.0,1/12/2013,"Betcha not many people know that BJ's serves brunch on weekends? Neither did I and even though BJ's was not our first choice, it was a sufficient backup plan. No wait for a table but for a place with not too many customers during brunch, it did take an unusually long time for our food to come out. I didn't order anything super spectacular because 95% of the menu items are meaty or cheesy or eggy. But the one item that could be veganized was certainly satisfying: Oatmeal with dried fruit sans milk. Since it came with toast, I asked to add slices of avocado to place on top. It costs $1.50 which may seem pricy but I've seen other places charge way more for a smaller portion than what I got. My brunch options might be minimal but the ""normal people"" items had many options.

Scott Z.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1682,590,347,3.0,7/3/2014,"I'm going to say the jury is out for me on BJ's...one visit isn't terribly representative of a place unless it is great or horrible, and BJ's was just...just...okay for me. We came here prior to seeing a movie at the Del Amo multiplex.  There is ample parking whether you chose the structures, or the adjacent lots.  No worries there.  There is also over a dozen other eateries within walking distance, so if one place is jumping, it seems the other places work overflow pretty well. BJ's does have a pretty big menu...I got a salmon salad, my lady got a pasta dish.  Meh, they were okay, but not something super memorable.  While there seemed to be other items on the menu (pizzas, sandwiches, and salads) most of the menu is really high in calories.  I only saw 1/2 a page of lighter choices, and that's disappointing.   Although if you really wanted to sin, BJ's is known for their signature dessert, the Pizookie.  Which happens to be a pan sized cookie, served hot with ice cream and toppings.  Sort of like a cookie sundae or a hip-slapping, ass-popping, gut-bumping, rush of sugar that makes you go mmmmmhhmmmmm.  Seemed like everyone around us ordered one...or two!  Oh, America...land of the free and home of the morbidly obese.  Now I'm not saying I wouldn't try one, just make sure to share it with 84 of my closest friends.  With that much sugar (after a pretty fatty meal mind you) you could easily choke a donkey. Now, because we were in a rush to make our movie, we were able to get bar seating even though there was a 35 min wait.  Winner! The hostesses, and all were very very nice...the bar staff moved quickly and also did everything they could to make the experience worthwhile. I tried one of their in-house brewed beers, an amber, and it was ok...it was not a big production high-end beer...but it was beer.  It will eventually get you drunk, and no matter what it will assist you in making poor decisions.  Beer...it's probably how a lot of us got here. So BJs, big menu, close to a lot of things, decent service, huge cookie sundaes, and all kinds of booze...there is potential here.

Rob A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2104,789,4044,4.0,11/14/2012,"Nice restaurant, located outside of the Del Amo Mall.  That means, it picks up extra foot traffic.  That translates into, it gets extra busy.  Come during the in-between hours and you'll be fine.  If you've never been to one before (It's a chain), they're pretty nice.  The menu covers a wide range from burgers and specialty salads to pizza, chicken, soups and  pasta.  If beer is your thing, they have a wide range to choose from.  So, go on it, and have them seat you at a table, or head to the long bar if that's you're thing. There's the web site to scratch your itch.  Giant TVs, with sports on, keeps things lively.  The place is large yet comfortable.  Darker interior sets a nice mood.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  And they stay busy.

The ambience was the same as everywhere, clean, calming music, and not very busy at all. Thats why I am bothered with the way this BJ's was scored.  So I sit down at a booth at the bar tell my host there would be two more people joining . As My waiter goes to bring the extra  menus my nose begins to bleed probably from my lack of food cuz I was really hungry!  So I asked for some napkins. The waiter comes back with only TWO NAPKINs. Really!?!? Ok Maybe they have to keep their inventory real tight. I can understand.  After a few minutes he returns with my beer and doesn't comeback to check if I was ready so I got up towards the bar pretending that I did not know how the ordering went about. Obviously I did if I wanted to order from the bar tender I would've sat at the bar. Fortunately for this establishment ""the manager"" (he never introduced himself as the manager, or wore a name tag but he was wearing a light green button up shirt) stopped me from speaking to the bartender and requested the waiter to take my order.  I ordered an Alfredo Fettucini (with no chicken) pasta and salad lunch special and an order of avocado egg rolls- My favorite!  Ten minutes later the avocado egg rolls arrive and they look funny?!?! They were super burnt and still served them on my plate! I was quite surprised with this because I was not even that busy at the bar section. Really BJ's?!? I call ""the manager"" and he stopped me from finishing my statement and reordered my because of how burnt the egg rolls were.  A little rude but I liked his ""call to action"".  So I pretty much got all of my food at the same time... Whatever I was hungry. My avocado egg rolls were now delicious! The mozzarella salad was great and when they brought my Fettucini Alfredo IT HAD CHICKEN!!! What is this like Strike 4!?!  Really BJ's in Carson I just remembered that the last time I came to this same location my order was just as bad with mistakes and mishaps. Last time I received my order as I walked out the door because of how many times they had to fix my order.  I originally wanted to rate this place a 2 because of the quality, presentation and the BJ feel of the place but after remembering of my last visit this place NEEDS A 1.

Then, our waiter comes with her hands in her pocket and takes out order. When she came back with our plates, we notice a huge dried spinach on one of our ""new"" plates. We give the plate back asking for new ones and yet we received no apologies and she just says ""ok"" and walks away. Our appetizer, fried calamari, first comes out. But it isn't hot. It's room temperature with a few calamari just in our dipping sauce. Then, Our pizza comes out. But once again it isn't hot, it's room temperature and the pizza wasn't cut so my friend and I struggled to cut through the cooled down pizza.

Shantoya H.,"Inglewood, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2017,"If I could give this restaurant no stars I would. I enjoy coming to Bj's and one person ruined my entire dining experience. Everything started off very positive. Once we were seated our waitress came to the table to take our orders and she was very dry and didn't appear to be very friendly. Still not a problem. Once we were done placing orders the waitress whose name is Toni snatched the menu out of my hand. I still didn't stay anything. Once our appetizers was served Toni brought a new waitress over by the name of Anissa and said she was going on break. She was wonderful and turned the experience around quickly. I watched Toni serve food to other table, but she was supposed to be on a break. I thought it was odd. At some point she did eventually go on a break. Once her break ended she never came back to our table. I watched how interacted with her other tables. She was very friendly with her customers and each time that she passed our table she gave us nasty looks. Once our check came we paid our bill and tipped Anissa. We thanked Anissa for her wonderful service. Before we left the restaurant we decided to speak with the manager to let her know about Toni's behavior. We spoke with Christina and she assured that she would talk to her. We were still finishing dessert when Toni walked past our table and called us B*****s. I had to make sure that I wasn't imagining things. I wasn't because 4 other people saw the same thing including my 11 year old. I said someone better go get the manager because we are about to have a serious issue. Toni walked passed our table again and flipped the bird to us. Again we have our children present who is witnessing this behavior. I completely lost my cool and was about to flip over the entire table because at this point I am livid. Christina the manager walks over to my table and I explain what has happened. I can tell that she was not pleased to hear what her waitress has done. Christina then went to talk to Toni and she stormed out of her job. Christina gave me a courtesy card to come in for another visit in addition to giving me information for the GM of that location. Christina was very professional and I appreciate her hospitality and trying to rectify the issue at hand. I am never the type to mess with anyone's livelihood, but that was just ridiculous. In all my years as a consumer have never felt so disrespected in a place where I am spending my hard earned money.

It had been a while since we had been, but then we had a great time and kept coming back. Usually we will get one of BJs many awesome house beers, the sriracha brussels sprouts, santa fe spring rolls, the ahi poke, and the queso dip. All of these items are delicious and affordable. We often aim for happy hour or Tuesdays since it is happy hour all day then. We also love the PB smores pizookie. Talk about a sugar rush. The service is always attentive and friendly, and the restaurant is usually hopping with people. As long as the experience continues to be excellent, we plan to keep visiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=120

Ed S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,15,2,1.0,9/26/2017,"Story goes, my lady, brother, and Mother went to this BJ's location spur of the moment for my Mother's b-day. I was at nightschool so I couldn't make it. So, my bison burger and salad were ordered to-go with the assumption, it would be ready at the end of the meal. Nope.  It was the first thing delivered to the table. It was asked to be taken back. The waitress took it back promising a hot, fresh plate to go at the end of everybody's meal. Nope. What I got was the same beat burger that either sat out or was put in the fridge--it was cold (thank God I ordered a salad--which BTW sucked)  As I heard, my families meal consisted of uncooked pizza doughier than Pillsbury doughboy. When I got my burger, besides being cold (if it was taken out at the appropriate time, it would be somewhat warm--we live five minutes away), it was burnt. Charcoal. How the Hell do you mess up on a cheeseburger? Really. How do you mess up on the most common American food out there? Doughy pizza--sure I guess. But a flipping burger. That's one of my pet peeves in this world, screwing up something that is as easy to make as a cheeseburger that you make 100 times a day.  Please don't go here--if you here for the beer--just go up the street to the many breweries in Torrance.

We ordered 2 Pepperoni, and 1 half Buffalo half BBQ. We received 2 Pepperoni and 1 Buffalo. Granted, the Buffalo pizza is pretty awesome and our waiter threw in the BBQ pizza for free for making the error, but it's always a pain not getting what you asked for right. -Service- Since the food situation happened, clearly our waiter was not paying FULL attention Overall, never go wrong with BJ's pizza and/or a pizookie.

Tiffany T.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",512,101,449,4.0,4/4/2014,"I'm sure everyone is familiar with BJ's since the first one actually opened  up here in Orange County, California in 1978. Bj's operates several microbreweries which produce and distribute BJ's handcrafted beers throughout the chain. (Which is why you can't find then anywhere else expect at BJ's.) BJ's is also credited with creating the ""Pizookie"", a fresh baked cookie (white chocolate and macadamia nut, chocolate chip and many other flavors), with vanilla ice cream, served in a pizza style pan. The first few times I have tried BJ's two years ago (in Newport Beach) I wasn't impressed at all. The food was so-so and it wasn't anything worth remembering. When I had the opportunity to try the BJ's in Torrance I automatically changed my mind. The food here is actually quite delicious. I can tell that they changed the menu quite drastically from just a simple Chicago style pizza joint to an all-round American bar and good eats restaurant. Which included more than just  pizza. They also have flatbreads, pastas, burgers, salads, and creative new appetizers. My personal favorites are: Calfornia Club Flatbread Really warm and crispy with grilled chicken, Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, mozzerella cheese, roasted garlic aioli and diced avocados. (Really my FAVORITE dish here!) $9.75 Crispy Fried Artichokes Served with a lemon garlic aioli sauce. (If you like artichokes this is a must!) $4.50   Mini-Bruschetta Grilled focaccia bread topped with melted provolone and a blend of fresh Roma and sun-dried tomatoes, onions, basil and fire-roasted red bell peppers. (The mini bruschetta has a nice crunch in the bite along with the fresh tomatoes and basil finish.) $3.50 Tips: BJ's also has a Premier Rewards program that  earns you 1 point for every $1 you spend at BJ's. 75 points - You get $5 off your meal. 100 points - You get a free Pizookie 150 points - You get $10 off your meal. 350 points - You get $25 off your meal.  Pros: -Closes around 12 midnight! (Great place to grab a late night snack!) -They brew their own beer and they have their own root beer! (Which I think is awesome it actually tastes like root beer and its made fresh.) -The BJ's flatbreads are out of this world! (One of the best I have tried.) -This place is reasonably priced for the quality of food that is given. (The wedge salad here tastes better than the one a Flemings and it about 1/3 of the price.)   Cons: -This place can get quite loud and busy on Friday nights and  weekends. -I ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and overall the dish was soggy and oily. (The only appetizer that I didn't enjoy at BJ's.) -The menu changes quite frequently so when you come back a week later your favorite dish might not be there anymore. (Piranha Pale Ale Nachos and the Red Velet Pizookie I miss you =( Overall, Love the food! Love the location! (Its right next to the AMC 18 Movie Theather) So come with a group of friends and have a blast!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=260
Ryan W.,"Torrance, CA",863,710,2912,4.0,7/13/2012,"The lunch specials really are a great deal! I've been coming to bjs for a while now and here's a rundown of the things that I've ordered previously.  Service: At times can be a little slow, but it depends what time you go. If there's a game on or a weekend night, you can be waiting for a 1-2 hours. **The take-out girl, Tiffany is a cutie patootie :)  Appetizers:      Avocado egg rolls: 4.5 stars. Holy crap these things are amazing! Consists of tons of avocado, cream cheese, onions, cilantro, pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes wrapped in a wanton wrapper and deep fried until golden brown. The thing that makes this appetizer so good is the sauce that they serve alongside. It's packed with flavor and goes so well with the crunch of the wanton wrapper and the soft, creamy texture of the avocado and cream cheese. Definitely try this out!       Calamari: 4 stars. Deep fried calamari that is lightly battered and served with a spicy marinara and a lemon garlic aioli. The calamari itself is very soft and the batter is very light. The sauces go perfectly with the flavor from the calamari. One of the better calamaris that I've had.       Spinach and artichoke dip: 3 stars. Definitely nothing special and I would Not order this again. The blend of cheese, artichokes, and spinach seemed very watery. Compared to other places it was less creamy and seemed to have more of a liquified texture.  Food:      Cajun pasta: 3.5 stars. Fettuccini noodles with blackened chicken, red peppers, red onions in a creamy tomato sauce. I thought the chicken was nicely cooked to keep it moist and flavorful. The creamy tomato sauce packed a punch when it came to flavor and it had a little hint of spiciness to it. I really likes this pasta.       New Orleans jambalaya: 4 stars. I've had jambalaya from many different places and this one is one of the better tasting jambalayas. It consists of shrimps, blackened chicken, chicken-andouille sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes in a spicy sauce. The flavors hit you from so many different angles! This dish is packed with different meats and shrimps. Everything is cooked perfectly and it's all served on a bed of rice pilaf which makes the dish just absolutely delicious!       Shrimp scampi pasta: 2.5 stars. Angel hair pasta tossed in olive oil, garlic, butter, Roma tomatoes and lemon juice. Personally I thought they put in way too much lemon juice that it tasted like they put in lemonade without the sugar. Also the Roma tomatoes kind of masked all of the flavors along with the lemon juice. The thing that I love about the dish is the toast that is served alongside the pasta. Some of the most flavorful, crunchy cheese toasts that I've had. A+ on that!       Grilled mahi mahi tacos: 2.5 stars. Two grilled mahi mahi tacos with chipotle mayo, cabbage, onions and cilantro served with a creamy avocado sauce and a fire-roasted tomato sauce. I was a little disappointed with these tacos. It lacked the flavor that I expected it to have. The mahi mahi had no flavor at all and the little cabbage cole slaw that they put on top needed a pinch more salt and black pepper. The two salsas on the side also didn't pack enough heat the way I expected it to. The other disappointing thing was that the dish was just the two tacos by itself. I understand that this dish was part of the lunch special, but it could at least come with something else. I mean, at Wahoos you can actually get two fish tacos, rice and beans for a cheaper price... Dessert:     Pazookie: 4 stars. Obviously this is the thing that they are most known for. They have a great selection of different cookie flavors to please every pallet. They have chocolate chip, red velvet, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin walnut, cookies n' cream, or triple chocolate. Personally I like the cookies n' cream, red velvet or the regular chocolate chip the best!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=260

My ex and I used to come here all the time and split a medium deep dish pizza - half BJ's Favorite and half with meatball, pepperoni, and bacon. Sounds delicious, right? IT IS! I think we were only able to get 2 slices down each (on a good night), and then we'd have to take the rest home. For drinks,  I'd always go with a strawberry lemonade (which, by the way, is like 1928392819 calories of goodness), and he would get a beer. His favorite was Jeremiah Red, but he was often adventurous if they had a seasonal beer. And people, I don't care how much you've ordered, how full you are, you HAVE to get a pizookie. Go in the bathroom and make yourself heave if you have to make room. *laughs*  Oh man...*mouth waters*...seriously so f'ing sick good. It doesn't matter if you go with choco chip, peanut butter, Ghiradhelli choco, Oreo, or Macadamia nut...ALL of it is good. Shoot, try a pizookie trio and get three flavors with various flavors of ice cream on top. It's free on your birthday!  Quick tip: Do a ""call ahead"" when you're on your way. If your name is on the ""call ahead"" list, you get priority seating when you arrive. It has saved me many a night of anxiety and frustration, because the line (especially on the weekends) are just ridiculous.

Melinda H.,"Manhattan, NY",183,25,2,1.0,12/14/2016,"First let me start by saying I like to dine at BJ's because they have good beer and good food. This specific BJ's needs a little help. This is the second time I have dined at this specific location; the first time being an OK experience with long wait times for our food in a low peak hour.  The second time being an awful experience. We had a server who was new, which we were completely understanding. However, we waited about 30 minutes for food at 10 p.m on a wed night. Prior to ordering our food we asked if there was happy hour and were told no. Found out aftermath that that was a lie. After the 30 minute wait, our server told us our food had been sitting on the counter for 20 minutes for a to-go order. Our food had to be remade again. Once we got our food, there was hair in it. Two hairs to be precise. Called the manager and the manager comped one of the meals but not the whole dinner. This could have been dealt with differently but we appreciated what we got.  I ordered the fish tacos and she offered to make me another fish taco to go. I accepted and not took an additional 20 minutes. The manager actually came back to our table to ask if that fish taco arrived and we smiled and Shook our heads. She didn't brought it out herself. Long story short, the way that BJ's has been to us the couple times we have been to the specific location we will not be back. The service is terrible. Food was good, just like the hair.

She took a very long time with our waters, she barely checked in with us to see if everything was fine or if we needed anything else, she was only eager when she gave us the bill. That's the only time she was smiling and being around our table but her Disneyland theme park voice was not fooling any of us. Then the server gave us our pizza with no plates.

Michael Q.,"Torrance, CA",206,102,456,3.0,3/6/2016,"I used to be a huge BJ's fan, but now it seems as if I like this place less and less each time I come. This past visit, on a Friday night, was below adequate. The wait was about 45 minutes for 8 people at 6. They had a malfunction with their buzzers, so we ended up waiting about 10 more minutes than we should have. Our service was below average as well. The waiter did not even introduce himself, and he didn't know the prices on some of the items. He was slow with water refills, which left us thirsty for portions of the meal. I ordered the Roast Beef Dip which was just adequate. It lacked any real flavor. My meal was $11.25, while others were on the higher side. It seems as if every time I come here the prices rise. I came here for a birthday, and they didn't even sing happy birthday to my friend on her 18th birthday. We did order a huge pizzookie platter which was delicious. On the other hand, it took us about 10-15 minutes to get our check which was annoying. BJ's better step it up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=260

Mike B.,"Torrance, CA",1,6,2,1.0,12/27/2015,"This one star review is very generous. We had a party of 6 adults and 1 toddler. The wait quoted was reasonable, but they went 35 minutes past the estimated time because there was a specific area / table they wanted to seat is at. That's ridiculous. There were other tables free and clear that would have accommodated our group.  Our waitress started us off nice but had to leave for an ""emergency"". We were fine with switching service staff, but the new staff did nothing to make us feel comfortable.  I was never offered another beer nor were any of the water glasses refilled (and that was all a couple of adults ordered to drink).  When it was time to pay, the waiter skipped by us and didn't pick up the bill.  It was 40 minutes before our bill was picked up and processed for signature, that included waiting on a pizookie to-go. I can't believe the manager didn't catch all that was not happening with our group. It was like we were invisible to the service staff.  We definitely didn't feel welcome here and we won't be coming back.   You might expect poor service towards a rowdy group (which doesn't make it acceptable), but we were calm, lo-key, adults and there were only 2 alcoholic drinks on our table. I know serving others can be difficult, but not serving is unacceptable.   A big ""thank you"" should be given to the family sitting in the booth across from us. They shared their ketchup bottle with us because we couldn't get a service member to bring 1 for our table (isn't ketchup standard with burger and fries?).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=280

Ordered our drinks, ordered our appetizers, got our drinks, ordered our entrees, got our mozzarella sticks.  Munched on our mozzarella sticks, got our entrees (Santa Fe salad for me, and the ham/bacon/turkey sandwich for the bf). Bf had also ordered me a strawberry pina colada mixture of some sort.  Not bad at all.  I had to mix it up, otherwise there were a few sips that were quite sweet. Food-wise, definitely enjoyed the mozzarella sticks.  Crunchy, good amount of cheese, and marinara sauce was good.  Fresh parmesan on top didn't cause an issue, either :)   Bf absolutely LOVED his ham/bacon/turkey sandwich.  He said it had the perfect balance of crisp/crunch of the grilled panini-style bread, and that the turkey/ham/bacon combination meshed well with the cheese and the overall flavor.  I think he said it was the best turkey sandwich he ever had... @_@;; For me, the Santa Fe salad was good.  Fresh ingredients and good size.  Was hoping for more spice, but the chicken with cayenne pepper wasn't bad at all. The service was very polite, but there were times when it felt like it was a little slow. Felt like a standard BJ's, but the doors are awesome! Only thing I don't like are the bathrooms.  For whatever reason, they decided to have some sort of bright spotlight overhead in each of the stalls.  So, this means that I can clearly see my shadow in whatever I'm doing in the bathroom and, because the divisions between the stalls aren't too low, my next door neighbor can get a general idea of what I'm doing, and I can guess what they're doing.  It's like something out of  the musical Chicago, where they're waiting for a song and dance.  Creepy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=280

I usually start with the caprese salad. Sometime I order the tomato soup for my entree, sometimes I'll splurge and get the rib eye. Seriously everything is good here!  I work at the mall so sometimes I like to come here on my lunch break. Sometimes I just get a baked potato, sometimes I get the caprese salad.

I've had some really funny people, chill people, plain/boring people, but no matter what they're like they all have the same thing in common: bad service.

The food didn't taste so good to me there. So I said to myself, maybe I'll go to my local one here at Del Amo mall and maybe the food will taste better when I'm well rested and relaxed and in a happy mood. So I went with my parents and other family members that Xmas and the food was the same--average and especially over-priced. I ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings and it was almost $34 dollars!!!! And it wasn't even good, it was like those horrible pan pizzas you get at Pizza Hut. It didn't even look like a large, it looked like a medium. I can get a better pizza and large too with 3 toppings at Domino's for $8 only and only 2 bucks for extra toppings. At this horrible restaurant, only cheese is free and anything above it is almost $5 for extra toppings. And the portions of the food here and at any BJ's are horribly small and you pay so much money for little portions.

Mary Jane C.,"Torrance, CA",416,445,268,3.0,6/24/2014,"So we returned this year for an early birthday party for my boyfriend.. this was a little messier than usual.  I had made the reservation a few days earlier, the earliest they could seat a table of 14 was at 8:00pm--so we took a late dinner reservation.  About 7:30pm we found out our group would be 20 people.. I called and asked if it would be possible to accommodate the add-ons.  I spoke with the manager, Eric, who said yes.  They were seating us in the open seating area and would put the table of 6 nearby (which was fine with me).   Upon arrival, my sister had checked us in already.. so we waited outside.  Wasn't much of a wait that by 8:15pm we were seated in a side room.. which was fine, I was told the table next to it had been there for 1:15 hour and it was up to us to wait.  They made it sound like they were leaving soon..  At this point maybe 15 of our party had arrived, but by 8:30pm everyone was there, standing room for the latecomers.  AND the table of 6 hadn't even gotten their dinner yet--in fact they didn't get it until 8:30pm, we saw them get served.. what the heck?!  I know they'd been there for over an hour, but that was a big failure to tell us that they hadn't even been served their food yet. Eventually the OTHER side room with a group cleared out and we were moved, this was probably 9:15pm.  This was a very very very very long dinner.  Cory, who ended up being our final waiter in that room that night, and he was a gem.  Very patient with us, checked up on us, kept our cups filled.   The pizza.. I don't know who cut it.  We would have slices anywhere from 1"" wide to 4"" wide, and some were stubby.. terrible job with the slicing.  Some of the pizzas had portions that had no filling towards the edge, and were just great puffs of bread.  And the deep dish, albeit deep--was either not cooked enough or just came out floppy.  We would lift a slice and it would literally fall apart just trying to get on the spatula.  I do not know what was going on the kitchen that night.  No one complained, everyone was starving, but still. We didn't end up out of the place til almost 11pm.  We ordered 11 mini pizookies at 10:15pm and it took 30 minutes to get to us.. it was so.. long.. our friends joked if they were making the cookie dough from scratch. I like you BJs, but this was messy.  If you couldn't accommodate the changes, we would have moved the group of 6 elsewhere, just be honest.  Your server was great, your food was mediocre at best that night, and the kitchen was slow.  Ay yi yi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=280

Drinks come fast and are amazing, sadly the cheese sticks were out almost the same time it took to make the drinks, and were cold. It took another 5 minutes of trying to get someone's attention to get the plate replaced with the same food just reheated.  We are halfway through our drinks and are trying to get someone's attention (again) for some water or a coke, the whole time our server flops our food on the table or seems disinterested in our visit it's off putting.

We arrived at 6:30 and he let them know we were there... we got called up at 7:15 and before we got seated someone who looked, but didn't act at all like a manager informed us that we had a 2 hour time limit from the time of our reservation....wait what? first of all....why were we not told about a time limit when we made the reservation? second of all.. from the time of our reservation? which was 7 and we were there but you didn't even call us up until 7:15...but you're timing us from 7? that's insane.

Mark J.,"Torrance, CA",463,12,3,1.0,9/22/2015,"Wish I could rate a -5 stars!  Embarrassed for our waiter! My wife has tomorrow off from teaching. Thought it would be great to hit up something casual, quick and a bit on the ""chain"" side of dining in the South Bay. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought this to happen. Now we're not one to loose patience too easily, thankfully. We are also very much at ease with mistakes and some levels of just bad business. But, when management just doesn't care and has that attitude of ""well, it is what it is. Can't help you"", especially when you're more than kind and patient! I gotta warn my friends!  So, I ordered one of the BJ Stouts, my wife ordered a nice glass of Le Creme wine. My Stout shows up in a nice tall beer glass. The wine? In a nice short wine carafe but with a wide mouthed flute styled beer glass! WHAT? So, we ask our more than helpful and clearly frustrated water, ""are you out of wine glasses?"" He responds, ""yeah, don't know why but we only have a few today"". Everyone is ordering wine and we don't have wine glasses. Ok, well clearly something was up and it suddenly turned into a ""principle"" matter. So, being my wife's husband, I chose not to drink my beer and wait till a wine glass showed up. Clearly our waiter was frustrated as we weren't the only ones in this position. I stepped up to the bar and asked the bar back if they had any to help out our waiter, she too said nope don't have any. REALLY? Are we acting spoiled or are we amazed that a chain establishment doesn't have enough wine glasses? Really? Pretty amazed to say the least! The manager must of walked by 10 times, Looked right at us and our drinks could clearly see we weren't happy and didn't even ask or say a word. Well, we made the effort and spoke MR. ERIC FLORES the manager about this wine glass issue. HIs demeanor? Couldn't care less and knew that if we left unhappy, someone else would sit where we were. He basically said, ""yeah, don't know what happened or why we don't have any wine glasses. Oh well, maybe they broke or something last night"". Couldn't give a damn about the customers! I sat there and just stared at him and didn't say a word. He then walked away. No, apology. Or, ""Oh, we'll take your beer and wine off the tab. No, let me see what I can do"". Nothing.  Maybe it's a bit  petty cause they did have a beer glass at least?  However, if there was even a thread of courtesy to us as the ""CUSTOMER""... we would have been ok. I think my wife would have had the wine in the tall flute style beer glass. However, the attitude that manager threw mixed with his I don't care about you demeanor was out of control! Food was par, our waiter was clearly overwhelmed. Hate to say this, ""we will not be returning to this BJ's"". Oh, after the brussels and pizza and moments before the check arrived... a wine glass showed up and they actually did take the $3.47 off the bill for the glass of wine.

I've been to this restaurant too many times to the count, and the food is always pretty good. But tonight we were lucky enough to come across a server who was so kind, so caring and attentive that I had to write a review just on him (which I've never done before). Joe approached us like we were the important people in the room, treating us with the utmost kindness and respect. It threw us off immediately, usually servers here are just okay. Joe was so sweet and different, he genuinely cared about us and even went out of his way to get us the best deals possible. Such a stand up employee and person. On top of his wonderful attitude, he was prompt, on top of things even though his section was full and he doted on us without missing a beat. BJ's, I hope you are treating your server right, because you are lucky to have someone who is such a needle in a haystack. In all my years of visiting restaurants, I've never come across anyone like Joe. I sincerely recommend you give him a token of appreciation because this guy goes way above and beyond what a server needs to or gets PAID to.

Randy D.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",26,2,1,1.0,10/11/2016,"This place has turned into a joke.  My wife and I have been coming here for years and have noticed a significant downgrade in service and food.  The servers are slow and forgetful, the food was cold and/or under cooked and the workers are just flat out rude. We asked for a manager 4 times before actually getting him and explained how our kids ate under cooked chicken and that a server flat out refused to give us a bag to take home the leftover trash we ordered.  The workers response was that he was ""joking"" but there's a time and place for everything and that doesn't excuse him.  Further more he kept insisting it was just a joke like we were old buddies having a spat.  The manager seemed completely oblivious to everything and offered up an apology but did not stick around long enough to hear him finish.  Couldn't have left fast enough and rest assured will not be returning to that venue or any other venue that bears the BJ's logo.  You've lost honest patrons of your mediocre establishment forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=320
Andrea C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,10,,3.0,7/7/2015,"This is one of my go to places to go with friends. I love the drink options and the food is pretty good. I especially love the mimosa deal with brunch on weekends! My only gripes are that some of the items are very overpriced and the service can be really hit or miss. Items forgotten, etc. For example, I went twice in one week last month. On Monday, I got amazing service from a lovely waitress (unfortunately, I've forgotten her name). On Wednesday, I got the strangest service and behavior I've ever seen from a waiter. I won't put his name because maybe it was his first week and he didn't realize what he was doing was wrong. Let's just say he spoke to my friend and I both like he was flirting and like we were three years old. You'd think the martinis would let him know this isn't acceptable? If you're reading this, sir, please never say ""Are we ready for din din?!"" to two obviously over 21 people. You were nice, you brought everything promptly, but we felt really uncomfortable.  Overall, I'm a fan of BJs. I definitely recommend the avocado egg rolls and calamari!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=320

Ruben S.,"Torrance, CA",55,63,13,4.0,11/16/2013,"I have been here several times for both lunch and dinners and I have always had good experiences here.     I would say 90 percent of the time I order the beef dip when I come here. The beef dip is amazing and the horseradish and aus jus compliment it so well. Give it a shot if you haven't tried it yet.  I hear they make good pizzas, sandwiches and other varieties of food but I can't comment on those from a personal stand point.     BJs crafts their own brew and they have several tasty ones.  I recommend trying the beer sampler which gives you the opportunity to try about 8 of their craft beers. Some of Their seasonal beers are tasty as well.  The most recent one I tried was the pumpkin spice ale and it was very good.  A pizzookie is a must when you come here. Those things are so damn good.  My favorite is the Oreo pizzookie...simply outstanding! In conclusion, BJs is makes some good food and crafts some good brews.  One draw back is that the place gets crowded so depending on the time and day, trying to get a spot at the bar area is near impossible and the wait times can be hefty. BJs is one of my favorites spots to grab a meal and a beer and you can count  on it that I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=320

Mom and Dad can have cocktails and nibble on the bar scene even with crying tots. The food met my expectations since I didn't see this place as a gourmet restaurant.

Anne B.,"Torrance, CA",6,38,16,3.0,3/4/2016,"In moments like these, I really wish I would leave half star reviews. (3.5 stars) Anyways, I've been here multiple times, usually for birthdays or dinner after a movie. I've noticed that every time I come here the prices keep getting higher. A large pizza is $26 now and the big pizookie platter is $22 now. I miss the days before price hikes... The wait time will be at least 30 minutes on a Friday night, but today the buzzer they gave us was really odd. It went off so my party went up to get our table, but then they said that it was an accident. So they gave us a new buzzer (which we later found out didn't work) and they ended up just calling us up since our buzzer wasn't buzzing. So when we went up to finally be seating they told us the table wasn't clean yet.. Then why did they even call us?! Besides the odd beginning, our server was very attentive and friendly.. even though he forgot to even tell us his name lol. As for the food, the pizza is usually good! We had the deep dish BBQ chicken today and it was pretty good but could have used more BBQ and could have been cooked a bit longer because it was a bit soggy. Their menu is very extensive with everything from burgers to pasta to salads to sandwiches to fish and tacos... you name it. But you can never go to BJ's without getting a pizookie (the only thing that makes me come back here)! The cookies and cream flavor is my personal favorite, it's a chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream and an Oreo mousse. There are also a few other desserts on the menu, the strawberry beignet looked really good as well!

They have a Thursday special for $18.95 for a full rack of ribs. It includes a salad, two sides and a mini pizookie for desert.  There was plenty of food for two of us.  We selected a baked potato and asparagus for the sides.  Even the baked potato was delicious.  It tasted fresh-baked and creamy, and it was large.  The asparagus was cooked to perfection.  For our salad, we chose the house salad with a very flavorful strawberry vinaigrette.  There are other salads to chose from.  For our mini pizookie, we selected the chocolate chunk pizookie with chocolate chip ice cream.  OMG!!  So good. I had a pizookie at BJ's for the first time a couple days ago, but this was my first full meal there.

After he took our drinks he came back and asked what I would like to order and I said I'd like to get the deep dish 'Great White' pizza and then he responds by saying ""You're so racist"" and my thought was like okay thats not really funny because clearly I'm a Hispanic female and you're African American and I know what racism feels like. But I just did a fake laugh and let it go. But then Mr. Duane comes out with my pizza and says to me in front of my friend ""Here's the pizza for the Trump supporter"" and walks away. Wow! I could not believe that came out of his mouth! how offensive is that to say to someone? Especially because I don't even know this guy, who made this guy a waiter?!

I called the host over and asked for a new waitress.  I did this because I'm not about to receive crappy service and not give a tip, when I can switch out my waitress for someone who is amazing and give them an awesome tip. With that being said the original waitress had an attitude and you can see it in her face. On the other hand, our new waitress was amazing and her vibe was what made everything turn positive.

Jasper L.,"Arcadia, CA",871,60,37,5.0,7/14/2014,"I don't like BJ's. I really don't. I actually went out of my way to avoid it after having one terrible experience after the next at other BJ's. But I went today because of nostalgic reasons. Because I wanted to eat a Pizookie on my birthday. I went during lunch hour and headed straight for the bar. Party of one unfortunately - no one else at work has my lunch schedule anymore. I went straight to the bar and was greeted by Andrew, or Andy as he preferred. He's the reason behind the 5 stars. He is knowledgable about the menu, charismatic and knows how to make small talk. It's the first time in the years I've given BJ's my business that I've met an employee capable of making you feel welcome. He was also on top of refilling my water and my root beer - no drinking during work hours :( After ordering a lunch special, the BBQ Chicken Pizza that came out was actually fantastic. The cilantro was fresh, tomatoes were good and the chicken wasn't dry. I was shocked. The salad before didn't disappoint either (But I'm a sucker for Honey Mustard). Noting my ID, Andy wished me a happy birthday and brought out the little mini birthday pizookie. How awesome is that. Thank you for making my experience a great one. The service was top notch and Andy did a great job restoring my faith in the chain. I don't think I'd go to any other location frankly.

Zachary M.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/9/2016,"My gf and I went on Saturday evening and it was very busy. We walk in and walk up to the hostess station, there were about 5 girls talking to each other, not one noticed us for a good minute. Finally one of the girls looked over and said ""for two?"" My gf said yes and she just rolled her eyes and started walking. I was about to call a manager but my gf said it's fine. When we go to our table my gf said thank you and again, the hostess rolled her eyes and walked away without explaining anything. I don't know if the hostess has been having a bad day but she shouldn't bring her attitude to work.       We just tried to brush off what just happened and enjoy our date night. But our server came up to us and he wasn't the greatest. He seems very stoned, with bloodshot eyes, very slow response, and kept saying ""I'm sorry, what was that?"" so we had to repeat our order many times. He wasn't rude so it didn't really bother us but our table next to us seemed very angry at him. I guess they brought out the food and they had no silverware for at least ten minutes until the father walked up to a server to ask for some, and their food was cold by then. The server also took one of their drinks for a refill and never came back with it for the whole meal. Now they were waiting for their dessert but it's been 30 minutes. It was hard to enjoy our meal when the people next to us were so angry.       But I have to say we love their food. Especially the best beginnings! It has a bit of everything and the portions are huge. They have a wide selection of beers too.       In all our meal was fine, but management really needs to work on training their staff and weeding out the rude ones.

I had to flag him down any time we needed something - and since I got only get his attention twice, we did not have the meal we wanted. for example I ordered fish and chips and was not given malt vinegar, no problem usually unless your waiter doesn't come by for another 30 minutes, so i went without. likewise, we would have ordered another round or 2 of drinks, but we're not given the opportunity.  We were beginning to think that Moses was just a bad waiter, but then another couple was sat across from us. Mind you, I am in a lesbian interracial relationship and the couple across from us was white and heterosexual. Moses paid them 100000000 times more attention - so much so it was hard to miss. He even squatted down at their table to tell them any specials and all of that. They were sat, fed, paid and gone and he whole time Moses ignored us completely.

And the service was indeed craptaculous - orders confused or forgotten until asked about, brought out slowly and at widely differing times, difficulty getting extra place settings, all the things you would expect of a place like this. That aside, though, I'll say this: the food was actually pretty good. I was not expecting that, but there you have it. I was expecting one step up in food quality from Denny's - it was several. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I wouldn't complain about it to the same extent I did this time, either. Their steak was an excellent cut of steak and cooked perfectly; their mango salad was pretty tasty (even if it could have used a lot more mango in it), and their tomato bisque soup was actually one of the best I've tasted.

He was the most pleasant, attentive, knowledgeable and amazing server I have had at a restaurant in a long time.  He made excellent beer selection suggestions and always kept us updated on how our orders were progressing.  This made the wait for the food seem like nothing. The beers were great (I had an Amber Oasis and the rest of the table ordered Jeremiah Reds).  A pint was about $5.75 for most beers, but they also offered pitchers.   The food itself was average, nothing too spectacular.  We started with calamari for an appetizer, and it was JUST enough for 2 people.  I definitely wouldn't recommend just one order for a larger party.  For the main course I ordered a 9"" ""sweet pig"" deep dish pizza.  The crust was excellent, not too saucy, and good amount of toppings.  HOWEVER, the price was ridiculous coming in at over $10.  Another person ordered the salmon, and it seemed pretty average.  The vegetables looked like the kind you buy frozen and then steam, the salmon was grilled (but nothing significant), and the price was your average Uncle Ben's rice. We finished with a pizookie which never disappoints, but again, not really shareable beyond 2 people. Overall, for a calamari appetizer, two small pizzas, three beers, a salmon dinner and a pizookie the bill came out to $90.  I'm deducting one star because for $100, I feel like the food quality and portions could've been a lot better.   The only reason I'd probably come back is for Happy Hour or something where the food is cheaper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=420

The person who took our order told us it would take about 15 minutes for our food to be ready and gave us the option to pick it up inside the restaurant or have it delivered to our car. We obviously chose to have the food delivered to our car. When we arrived we called the restaurant to let them know we were there and the host transferred us to the take out line where we were put on hold for at least 10 minutes. At this point, I had my boyfriend just go inside to get our order where he waited another 10 minutes for their staff to figure out where our order was. By the time we got our food, everything was completely cold and and soggy. Not to mention, they didn't even get our order right and gave us the wrong burgers! We settled and just ate the food because it probably would've taken another 20 minutes for them to get our food order right.

I had a mini pizza, watermelon salad, and okterberfest beer. All were really tasty. I never would have thought that watermelon and salad could be meshed together but I was pleasantly surprised. Our server was super friendly, but forgot our appetizer, and by the time dinner came out we didn't even bother asking for it. Lengthy space in between visits.

Geoff H.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",81,78,,4.0,6/18/2014,"I really like BJ's. It's usually quite crowded in here, which to me is the main downside to coming here. I never have a problem with the food- I think it's very good. I enjoy the pizza here, and while I realize that true Chicago natives will roll their eyes at their ""deep-dish,"" I still think it's quite good. The toppings are fresh and plentiful. I really like the touch of roasted tomato on top, and I actually don't even like tomatoes. I think the crust is nice and soft with good thickness and crunch along the edges. Come at happy hour and the mini-sized ones are at a really reasonable price. I also quite enjoy the beer selection here. Their house brews are all good, and I think their red is a nice one with a good but not too harsh bite to it.  For an American chain restaurant offering a variety of cuisines, I think BJ's does a very good job. If you haven't been here, it's worth a try!

The first time I went I wore flats, and fell trying to walk to the restroom to change my then 6 month old son, thankfully he was not hurt.  The other bad part was that the customers seemed to run to my rescue before any of the staff even looked my way.   Anyway, the place is ok, but Id never wear heels there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=420
Jonah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,10/20/2013,"I experienced what may possibly be the worst service I've EVER had at any restaurant I've ever been to at this location.  I had a party of four, in the evening.  We started with a waitress, who I unfortunately cannot remember her name (she was just fine, and in fact a pleasure).  We ordered five drinks, three beers, one liquor drink, and a sparkling lemonade.  I also asked if it would be possible to change one of the six televisions from a football game to a baseball game (Game 6 of the American League Championship series, Red Sox v. Tigers, an important game and one that honestly should have been on a tv already.)  About fifteen minutes after ordering our drinks, we placed our food order (two hamburgers, a steak, and a pizza).  At this time, our waitress informed us that she would be leaving for the evening, and we would be waited on by a young man named Obini.  Our waitress also told me that she had spoken to the manager, and they would be putting the baseball game on the tv presently.   This is where our visit suddenly took a sharp turn for the worst.  We waited another fifteen to twenty minutes before our first drinks arrived at our table.  Obini passed around the drinks, and when he came to me, he sat down my beer, and when I told him that the liquor drink was also mine, he seemed incredulous, and almost refused to give it to me (bearing in mind that it is not an uncommon practice for a grown man to order a beer and a liquor drink with dinner, especially in a bar type setting.)  The baseball game was still not on the television. About ten minutes later, our food was brought to our table, however one of our hamburgers had not even been put in to the kitchen.  Obini said ""That's not MY fault."" and left the table.  At least five minutes passed before he returned and said that he had placed the order in the kitchen.  The baseball game was still not on the television. At this point, my friend ordered a second beer.  At no point did Obini ask if anyone else at the table would like another drink, or a refill on the lemonade (at no point throughout the entire meal did he refill the lemonade.) About ten minutes later, the second hamburger came out, and no sort of apology was offered for it being later (I understand that it might not have been anyones fault, however this is a service industry and a simple apology can go a LONG way).  The baseball game was still not on the television. After finishing our meal, my friend ordered a third beer, at which time Obini said to him ""Are you driving? because you've already had four or five.""  In an incredibly condescending way.  I had also ordered a second beer (in addition to my liquor drink), and another in our group had ordered three drinks, as well.  The fourth member of our group had not ordered ANY alcohol at all, yet nobody else was subjected to his questioning.  Frankly, it was embarassing, especially considering Obini's protests were louder than anyone at our table.  The baseball game was still not on the television. I then asked to see a dessert menu, and Obini left for an inordinate amount of time before returning to take our dessert order.  One person in my group ordered her dessert, and then he walked away, and we had to shout after him to return and take the other THREE dessert orders. There was also a party of young men and women across from us, and I witnessed Obini not only TOUCH one of the UNDERAGE girls on her bare shoulder, but also stand so uncomfortably close to another that she physically moved away from him. He was RUDE, off putting, embarassing, and uppitty, and he alone made our experience so awful that it put a damper on my entire weekend.  I have never in my life seen any waitstaff so ill trained, and with so few manners working in an establishment that I otherwise frequent and enjoy.  And I missed the entire baseball game. UPDATE: I spoke with Scott montero, who is the general manager of this BJ's. He apologized and told me that he would send me a gift card, and to come back in and have another meal. One month passed and I had yet to receive any gift card from him. I sent an email and confirmed that he had my address correct.  Scott montero then told me that he would send the gift cards within the week (this is a month after he told me he had already sent them). Almost another full month later, I still have yet to receive them.  It goes without saying that I won't be returning to this restaurant, even if Scott montero were to actually send me a gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=420

Mitchell L.,"Millbrae, CA",61,26,102,2.0,7/9/2014,"Oh BJ's if you didn't have those always alluring and addicting pizookie's I swear I would never go back. This is just your typical American cuisine chain that really does not do anything that special, but rather just has a little bit of everything. Going to any American restaurant is a little hard considering that I tend to eat fairly healthy, except when it comes to pizookie's, so I do appreciate that they have a ""skinny"" menu. So I came with a huge group, 25, and luckily was able to get a reservation. We were seated immediately any had two main servers.  I skipped on the appetizers because there was nothing healthy that seemed appetizing really. For my entree I wen't for the mahi mahi which was listed at 420 calories. At 13 bucks I expected at the least a little pepper or salt, but this was literally the most bland piece of fish I have ever had. I had to ask for a the siracha and lots of it. The bed of rice and veggies that the fish sat atop of was bland as well except for the pineapple that it came with. This was literally 13 bucks of crap on a plate. Never again will I ever order this and neither should you! BJ's I would never come back if it not were for the pizookie's which are absolutely god sent. Then again it is pretty difficult to mess up a fresh baked cookie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely delicious, unlike the previous dish which was gross.  I know service can be difficult considering how busy BJ's normally is; I'm not exactly sure why to be honest. For twenty five people though we should be first priority considering you get the biggest freiking tip from us. We were only attended to when it came to getting our dishes, and any time after that we did not seem them once. What a shame, they deserved the most minimal tip, but of course with such a big party we didn't have a choice but to tip big.  Ambiance: 3/5 typical BJ's Food: 2/5 Should be a 1 if not for those delectable pizookie's Service: 1.5/5 Bus boys were around often enough.

Aileen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,57,28,1.0,2/22/2015,"After watching a movie my girlfriends and I decided that we were famished and decided to come eat at BJs. The reason for the 1 stars is for attitude and what I would say would be a health code violation of some sort regarding food. I am not a food professional so I could be wrong, but what I do possess is common sense. Our table received some of the avocado egg role which the server just plopped down and walked away without so much as a ""enjoy"", ""heres your food"" or even a ""kiss my ass"" would have sufficed. But no, we get just food put down and we tried to get his attention ""excuse me excuse me"" to no avail. So we waited while we looked around for our original server Katrina to come by so we could tell her that this was not our order. It took about 5 minutes to find someone, all the while the appetizer just sitting at our table. We finally saw our server and she realized it was not ours and basically took the appetizer and gave it to the right table which was next to ours. At this point I was completely appalled. I am not a food service professional nor have I ever worked in the food service industry BUT as a customer if I knew that my dish was sitting at someone else's table for longer than a minute and then transferred to my table you bet your sweet ass I would be completely livid. We did not touch the appetizer or do anything to it, but the fact that she was very nonchalant about it and didn't think twice to just move it over leads me to believe that this has happened more than once and the chances of all guests not touching what was put in front of them on accident are slim to none. She gave a dish that could have been tampered with to another table knowing full well it had been sitting at our table first. I am stilled appalled and when I told my other friends about it too, they were also appalled. I for one will not return to this particular BJs because who knows where my foods been since it was out from the kitchen. Not to mention the service sucks. I wouldn't go so far to say that our waitress was rude but you could tell she was having a bad day or maybe she just doesn't like her job but nonetheless service/friendliness NOT TO MENTION CLEANLINESS are issues that should be addressed.  The food itself is same o same o BJs food, good bang for your buck and thats about it.

There are a lot of TVs mounted on the front wall of the bar, and lots more around the entire restaurant, all of which are tuned to ESPN or some other sports channels. I guess BJ's is a sports bar. I drank their house stout, which was dark brown and clearly smelled of chocolate and caramel. I first tasted the chocolate and sweetness of the caramel, then I got a bit of the smoky malts, and it finishes off somewhat bitter. It's a medium-to-thick body beer. Stouts should be foamy, with no more than two fingers of head, and have good looking lace, but their brew didn't. So, it leads me to think that the glass I had wasn't that clean, or the hops they used weren't fresh, or both.

Sure, no problem. 20 minutes later I ask what's going on? Same answer... Okay, well since we had reservations shouldn't we just get the first available table?? 45 minutes later, same hostess said okay they were cleaning the table.

The manager was nice & explained the situation, but the hostess was cold & unaccommodating- didn't care we had waited an hour WITH reservations. There were other walk-in parties that day before we did! My whole point.. We had reservations to avoid waiting an hour for a table. 2nd my friends & I came in to grab a pizookie.

Yvonne B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,14,7,1.0,2/20/2016,"Ate here on 2/5/16, service was terrible. I am 36 years old and wasn't allowed to order a sangria at the bar. I had left my brand new drivers license at home by mistake, but had my old one on me. I showed it, it clearly verified my age. That's the only purpose of checking the ID and trusted at 36 there's no way I look under age in any way. When the waitress told me ""I can't take this"" with no further explanation my younger sister, who was with me insisted she check with the manager. This was even more upsetting. The manager, Scott Montero, refused to come over and speak with me. So I suppose that he looked at the 3 minorities at the table and assumed we'd be trouble, wussed-out and sent the waitress back to us without any reason just ""no."" From that time on I guess the waitress was scared or something, so she wouldn't come over to deliver any of our food, she sent someone else to bring our appetizers and to refill our water. Her service was terrible. But, but when it came time to pay they accepted my credit card. So a 2 month expired Driver's License is not acceptable to purchase a lousy sangria, the most light-weight drink on the menu, but it is ok for a credit card purchase. Because I'm obviously an under age criminal trying to score drinks at stupid BJ's in Torrance...(I hope you can detect the sarcasm) I don't curse but ""F"" you Scott Montero and both waitresses involved that day!

Steven H.,"Fairview, OR",13,76,62,2.0,5/6/2014,"Second time coming to this restaurant. I enjoy the food and that is why I am giving it one more star than I was going to. There is always a wait of about 30 minutes or longer to get a table, even for two. Both times I have been sat in a booth (not a big deal) but when the booths are extremely small and your fat, it is hard to try and squeeze in there. I felt like I looked like a I had a mushroom top on the tabletop. The waiter Cory had finally come up after several minutes and just looked at me with a weird look which was more like ""how the heck did he get in that booth, he looks hideous!""  He took my order and was pretty curt. Whenever he would come he would give his weird look and would slam my food or drinks on the table. He wouldn't ask how things were and didn't say anything but put the stuff down on the corner and walk away. On my way back to the car I saw one of the waiters that had just walked out for his break at his car smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer. He saw me approaching and turned around to try and hide it but it was too late I already saw it. This is what any customer wants to know is that the staff are outside smoking and drinking on their breaks so they can take extra good care of me when they return. I really want to give this place a higher score...if it was just on the food I would give them four stars as it is pretty darn good. I especially like the Parmesan Chicken and the Low Fat menu. I hope that if I decide to return that I get better service. I also would like to try paying for my bill with my phone which I saw was an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=400

The bartender apparently took 20 minutes to make our drinks, which the waitress came over and complained about. The manager came over and spoke to us. We told him we were expecting better service. When they couldn't find our reservation they didn't even try to do anything about it: it took three times of telling them that we had a reservation in order to bring the manager out.

Donald D.,"Torrance, CA",4,12,,2.0,11/21/2015,"The BJ's at del Amo has really gone down. We used to really love it and went there just about every Friday night. I loved the ribeye and my wife the New York steak. We hadn't been there in several months, and went back today. I was so disappointed that I'm not even home yet and writing this on my cell phone. The dinner salad, tomato amd mozzarella, was actually half of the salad plate, with an intricate design occupying the other half. It was delicious, but it was about three bites. The New York steak was, without exaggeration, smaller than a dollar bill and clearly had been cut down by the chef. It was also a cheap cut, very very dry with a gritty consistency. The ribeye was dry too, even though I asked for it medium. The naan bread was like those refrigerator biscuits you pop open with a knife handle. Service was slow, and we had to remind them about several things we'd asked for, bread included. The check was only $43 dollars, which is cheaper than I expected and remember (I was expecting around $60), but the meal was not worth even that.

I'd suggest that they garnish it with a slice of orange or lemon. I've tried the BJ ale last time and it wasn't all that great either comparing products from other local breweries. Both times we were greeted by the host with warmth and the servers were attentive. The last visit we had Josh and I happened to received a wet menu and he quickly apologized and got me another one.  He was also helpful helping us ordering and checking back often to make sure things are ok. We got the Ahi salad and the medium BJ deep dish pizza, which has a little bit of every toppings they offer. For about $15, the salad was refreshing with fresh pretty green herb/vegi leaves. The dressing was oil and light and I was able to taste the fish, pine nuts and the herb/vegi.  The medium size pizza was also good, but I just think that it is not $20 good.

Everything that I've had here though was just okay. The burgers are hit and miss with the flavors, the sandwiches are average, the pastas lack flavor, the salads are average, the appetizer platter is okay, the pizza is okay, the soups are mediocre, nothing spectacular but nothing disgusting either.

Justin L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",253,41,353,4.0,6/3/2015,"Over this past year, I've been coming to BJ's quite frequently. I'd have to say maybe around 10 times within the past few 3 months?  FOOD / DRINKS The food is pretty good. It isn't super oily compared to other American restaurants and I like how there is variety. Also, I think there is a healthier menu? For my entree, I usually get the Parmesan Crusted Chicken or the House Top Sirloin. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken comes with two big pieces of chicken and two chosen sides. Because I don't like the sides, I always ask if I can substitute them and they have no problem doing so. The chicken is really tender and not dry at all although sometimes it does come a little burnt. For the House Top Sirloin, it comes with the steak and two sides of your choice. Personally, it is way too fatty and oily for me, but I still love how it tastes. Both come is great portions and you will be extremely full.  I think the Cream Soda / Orange Cream Soda or Root Bear is a must try. It is actually really good and I almost never drink soda. It's not too sweet and it is definitely worth it. When I'm not feeling that, I get the Fresh-squeezed Strawberry Lemonade. This drink is really sweet but nonetheless, it tastes delicious. SERVICE The wait here can get pretty long because it is at Del Amo Fashion Center and it's usually busy all the time. Typically, you'll have to wait around 30-40 minutes dinner time. I would get there early if I were you. But the place really is a hit or miss. I've had times where my food was brought out so quick, I barely finished my appetizer. And other times where I waited for a good 15-20 minutes before it came. It really just depends on the waiter you get I guess. The Cream Sodas/Orange Cream Sodas/Root Beer comes from the bar so it takes awhile for it to come. If you want a refill, grab the waiter halfway through your glass. PARKING The horror. Parking here is almost impossible on the weekends and even dinner time weekdays. I hate coming to this location because I know I'm going to have to circle the parking lot a million years before finding a spot. I know I could park at the structure near Buffalo Wild Wings, but the walk will be so far and I wouldn't say I'm lazy but it's just too far. The spots here are also really small so if you drive a big car, you might have a hard time. Overall I'd have to say I'm a fan. I think their food is pretty good and it's of good value. Definitely a place I would keep coming back to because I enjoy enjoy the ambiance as well as the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=300

Pros: The cookie desserts are delicious.  The chocolate with chocolate ice cream is my favorite.  My least favorite is the red velvet.  Oreo cookie is solid.  PB is good.  Chocolate chip is classic. The salads are tasty.  The chicken entrees are good enough.  The french fries are good. Cons: We never got our drinks refilled even though I told the waiter.  I was thirsty for an hour before I practically yelled at our waiter to refill my drink.   I have NEVER had good service here.  Not one time!

I've ordered many of the deep dish pizzas here and all of them have not failed in taste!  This particular night, we ordered the chicken bacon ranch and it was fantastic!  And as any meal at BJ's, you CANNOT go home without getting their pizookies!  Can fit that thing in even after you stuffed yourself with food!

Brandon V.,"Torrance, CA",113,255,201,3.0,10/20/2010,"My dining experience at BJ's during my last visit wasn't all that great.  Same great food and beer, but the service that night was just horrible.  My usual order is the great white and some chicken lettuce wraps.  Easy order, right?  Nothing fancy, just pizza and lettuce wraps. Twenty minutes have gone by after placing our order and the pizza comes.  Great tasting pizza, deep dish, alfredo sauce, grilled chicken, and melted cheese.  Yum!  So I'm eating and I'm thinking this in my head, ""Strange how the pizza came before the chicken lettuce wraps."" Ten minutes after we got the pizza, the lettuce wraps finally came.  Except it wasn't the chicken lettuce wraps.  They served us the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps.  So, we had them take it back.  After we ate most of the pizza, we ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie.   About ten minutes after ordering the pizookie, it finally came.  Sweet sensation baby!  Fresh and warm and ready to be fully covered with ice cream.  It made me forget about the chicken lettuce wraps that never made it to the table without an explanation.  Perhaps I should put an ad about it on a milk carton:  ""HAVE YOU SEEN MY CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS?""   So we got the bill and they had the nerve to charge us for the chicken lettuce wraps.  So I asked the waitress, ""Do you remember taking the wrong lettuce wraps back?""  She said she did.  Then I told her that the chicken lettuce wraps never made it to this table.  She asked me if I was serious.  At that point, I wanted to start twitching.  I wanted to turn green.  I wanted my body to rip through my clothes and say, ""Now do I look serious?""  Bottom line, they fixed the check, I went on my merry way, and I ended up with a nice pen.   FOOD:  5 STARS SERVICE THAT NIGHT:  2 STARS OVERALL:  3.5 STARS",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=480

Jenn G.,"Torrance, CA",1679,1065,6642,3.0,7/26/2009,"Everytime I think of BJ's I think of good times with friends over pizza and pizookie. When BJ's opened up here in Torrance I was curious to see how it was. I had heard that it got pretty crowded here and that the waiting time could be long so I didn't come here right away. I finally came here recently to BJ's for a lunch with an old friend.  I honestly expected this place to be bigger but it was actually not that big. Luckily it wasn't too crowded either. It was Saturday lunch time and so I expected more people but only a couple of the tables were filled. We were seated pretty quickly and given our menus were given quickly. After scanning the menu, I chose the California grilled chicken sandwich along with their root beer. My friend also ordered a chicken sandwich and a Caesar salad.  My root beer came out first. BJ's freshly brews their own root beer and so I was curious to try it out. It was pretty good and a bit on the sweet side. I noticed however it wasn't that cold when served. It would have been a bit better if it was somewhat chilled.  Our entrees were quickly served but I did notice that my friend's Caesar salad came after her entree was served. This was a little weird considering salads are usually served before the main meal =P. They also gave her the wrong drink by giving her a coke instead of an iced tea.  My entree was the California grilled chicken sandwich. This is a chicken sandwich on a sourdough bread. Inside the sandwich there are big pieces of chicken, avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing. I got this with the wedge cut fries. (You actually have the choice of getting wedge cut fries or regular fries). Taste wise it was OK. It was good but nothing way out of the ordinary. It does leaving you feeling pretty full though. I actually only ended up eating half there and the other half I took to-go. I had no room for the pizookie (too bad because I think I would of rather enjoyed that lil treat...)  I kinda wish I ordered pizza because I noticed one of the deep dish pizzas at a nearby table and it looked pretty good.  Anyways I wouldn't mind coming here again. It is kinda pricey but the prices are pretty comparable to other competitor restaurants.  The vibe of the place is not bad. They have tv's everywhere and it kind of has a sporty kinda feel to it.  Oh yes Bonus points for having a tv that turned onto the NHL network...yay hockey :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=480

Katrina is in the latter. My girlfriend and I were there post rush but far before closing. She was rude,  ignores us,  and made us feel like we were imposing on her space.

I called back the next day, I spoke with another manager. She told me to add the points myself, while on the phone I explained that I can not. I tried a fourth time while still on the phone through the website, and the app. She took down my name and number to see if it went through or was still pending on her end. Normally I receive  an email hours after my purchase, stating my points went on my card. She did not return my call, I still have not received my points.

When the time came, we head to be seated until the lady seating us, told us to stop because our table wasn't ready because it was still dirty, she then just headed to the front as if nothing happened. The lady just left us mid aisle with no instructions except for ""stop"" so what were we suppose to do when our table was still dirty & we were just standing there? My feet were killing me from shopping all day so I sat down. We waited a good 10 minutes at the dirty table until the manager noticed all the dishes to the side and it was just my boyfriend & I talking. She then got a bit mad and asked us what happened. As we tried to explain our story, she said to point out the lady who seated us so she can tell her what she did wrong and how she could fix it. We looked after the manager left as she approached the lady who had seated us and she acted as if she did not know what we were taking about. As if we seated ourselves. Let me remind you I waited that 15 minutes to be seated! The manager then came back & asked if we seated ourselves but we tried explaining the lady just left us with a dirty table. The manager YET did not really believe us and told us it was ""okay if you seated yourself"" but we DID NOT. I was so disappointed at how the lady acted as if she did not even know who we were and how she ""did not"" seat us. I was left speechless. Later, our waiter brought us our drinks which were the wrong ones but we did not say anything.

This is a usual and popular spot for our rep-sponsored happy hours after work.  Aside from all the giggles and smirks that come about when all my nurse friends say ""I love BJ's"", I can honestly say that we always have a great time and a great meal when we go here.  Drinks and appetizers are what we get... The perfectly breaded fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip with the warm and thin-crispy chips, the Italian-twist Ahi poke, and the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps and the avocado egg rolls that *everybody* loves... It's great eats, all of it!!! Flatbread pizzas are a must, too!!! We have some fans of the goat cheese flatbread, and the Margherita flatbread disappears as soon as it hits the table!  The potato skin deals need to be eaten right away or the potato itself gets kinda tough to eat as it gets cold...   And the drinks!!! The Jeremiah Red is a favorite for the guys, as well as the Piranha. One of these times I'm gonna skip the cocktails and try one of the brews... There's the Brewhouse Blonde that I'd like to try. I tried the Coconut Mojito last night and it was delicious!!! Two of my girlfriends ordered this Spring-special cocktail and they enjoyed it, as well! Last night was definitely a Mojito night for the ladies.... Strawberry, white peach, pomegranate... One time we went we tried up all of the Martinis. Pomegranate was my favorite, and the lemon drop was an all around favorite.  Yes, this place gets mad crazy and packed, especially after 5pm. If you have a big party (10 or more) definitely make reservations ahead of time to secure a spot for your party! Last night was a last minute deal for all of us, but the staff did their best to accommodate us and we were able to get one of the patios and enjoy our time there before our 9:30pm cut off time (another party had reservations then...) Our other times there, arrangements were made ahead of time and our wait to clear tables and get everything situated wasn't very long. Oh, and there are plenty of heaters to keep you comfortably warm when out on the patios. We seem to always have great service when we're there, so I have no complaints with that... I can usually get a good parking spot in the lot in front of the restaurant, on the Carson side. Honestly, it's the only place I know to park where I won't get lost or confused when it comes time to leave, lol...

Nicole S.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,49,36,1.0,3/3/2016,"Came here last Saturday and had the absolute worst restaurant experience. I had a movie to catch later that night so we got here about 2.5 hours early. There were lots of restaurant to choose from but I decided to go to bjs because I had only been once before for a work party and wanted to give it a shot. We were quoted a 25 min wait time and I guess they just call out your name which is a very stupid system, anyways 25 mins goes by and we check in with the hostess who then tells us it's actually going to be an additional 25-30mins. It was annoying but I know that kind of thing can happen so we waited and finally got shown to our table where our server stops by to tell us she will be with us shortly. About 5 mins goes by and she comes back to first check in with her other tables and offer desserts before even taking our drink order. After she finished with everyone else she finally came by to take our order. The salad I ordered came out before our 2 waters did which is ridiculous. After I finish my salad the drinks then come out and then our food. My bf got the chicken club sandwich and I tried a bite. In that one bite I got something that may have been a chicken bone stuck in the roof on my mouth causing it to bleed and it was really painful and hard to get out. At this point I'm pissed but decide to not say anything to management because I was in a rush and just didn't want to deal with it. Jasmine then took over while our server was on break and I really appreciated her sincerity on how slow the service was that night, she was really sweet and at least explained to us that things were running a little bit behind that night without us even complaining or anything. By the time we needed our check our server seemed really busy so we asked another server who told us he couldn't help us and to ask our server to get it... I then saw the manager and called him over for our check. He was nice but didn't ask how everything was or anything which I feel like is a managers responsibility. All around a terrible experience. No teamwork in the restaurant, felt like we were the last priority, got hurt, and had a terrible time. Complete waste of money coming here. Very unprofessional on all parts.

Steve K.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,125,139,4.0,8/5/2013,"Been here over 20 times and have noticed that service at this particular BJ's is directly proportional to where you sit. Once you enter the door and facing the podium, the bar is situated on the left. The further right you sit (aisle-wise), the shittier service you get. It never-ever fails. If you're lucky to sit on the left-most aisle, consider yourself lucky! The central aisle, which we sat in most, is also serviced by well attentive servers.  The right-most aisle, we've probably sat in 5 times, and all of those times we had to wait over 10 minutes before our server would greet us, always had problems refilling our drinks and always had an issue with server checking up on us. Other than that, BJ's always hit the spot. If you dine here often like us, be sure to sign up for the Premiere Rewards program. We've redeemed two $25-off coupons already. Just remember, avoid the right-most aisle (because I think the right-most aisle is where all the n00b servers are training). Update 7/22/14 - ever since I wrote this review, we've sat at the bar (not within the tables in the bar area, but the actual bar, on the bar stool), never an issue with service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=460

I am a beer lover, and BJ's has their own brews (Jeremiah Red if I can handle all the alcohol or the Nutty Brewnette if I want to slow it down a bit) - - as well as a rather extensive selection of Belgians and other hard-to-finds.   The service is nice and friendly, and speedy about 89% of the time.  It is packed most of the time, so, yeah, you might have to wait for a minute every once in a while... The food is decent too.  I am a HUGE fan of their ""Small Bites"" menu.  You end up spending as much as a large meal, but you get to try a whole bunch of little things, all of which I really really like.  Fresh mozzarella and tomato salad, stuffed mushrooms, fried wontons....  Really good!   Their menu is very large, and very diverse... So if there is one meal you aren't in love with, you are bound to find another that you love. And finally, they have a really really good HH.  Apparently Tuesdays you can get ANY wine 1/2 off.  And they have a decent wine selection.  Their HH is terrific on their own brews which, last time I was there, was every day during the lunch-time hours.  If I remember correctly.  My point is:  Many ways you can experience a HH deal there.

I always get the entree items and they're pretty OK. Nothing to brag about, but they're pleasant. Texas-fried Chicken is good because the portion is huge! Pasta dishes are tasty too but their portion is not too big. Pizzokies are good, but the crumble was a revelation and very different from other crumbles that I've had before.

When we tried to help her she said she knew what she was doing and didn't need our help. The icing on the cake was when she circled the suggested gratuity...seriously for your bad service? Normally I'd feel bad and give a tip but she didn't even feel sorry for the way she was acting. She clearly hated her job. One of my friends went to complain to the manager.

Cerene C.,"Carson, CA",0,12,3,2.0,4/8/2015,"First off, me and my bf have been here a couple of times because of their pizookie. I love thie place. But one unfortunate thing happened. Me and my bf decided to eat here today for some good food and pizookie at around 3:45pm. It wasn't packed and we got a seat as soon as we got there. So all is good. We ordered our food. My boyfriend got the salmon and I got the southern chicken. Then we waited  and waited some more. We saw people who came after us got their food.  Then after an hour (more or less) of waiting, the manager came to our table to apologize for the wait. He said that the salmon accidentally got served to another table. He offered us free soup (we got the tomato soup) and it was good.  Food wise, there's really no complains. What annoys me the most was our server (she's a blond one, I forgot her name). Never did she update us about our food while we were waiting for so long. When we got our order, never did she apologize for the long wait. And when we were almost done eating, she went to us with the check already before asking us if we want some dessert. We told her we wanted the pizookie so she took back the check and left. We got our pizookie (triple chocolate) and it looked so good. A few minutes after we got the pizookie, she came back with the check again and said 'no rush, it's for your convenience'. So we just put our card while we continued eating. She rushed to get our card then came back for the receipt. We were not even halfway the pizookie yet (my bf and i were just sharing) so we didn't sign the check yet. Then she went back again to go get the receipt and we told her we haven't signed yet. A few minutes later she went back and we haven't signed it yet again. So I told my bf just to sign it to get it over with. It's just an unpleasant experience because it felt like she was rushing us. It wasn't our fault in the first place that we were there so long. It was the ""swapped salmon's"" fault. She even just came to us once to ask how we were doing and it looked like she didn't want to be there. To the manager who came to our table to apologize and offered us free soup, thank you so much. You are professional and you seems to care for your customers greatly. To that blonde woman who unfortunately was our server for the day, I hope that you don't rush every customers that you serve. Learn to smile genuinely. Learn to care about your customers. Learn ""customer service"". We weren't going to tip you but we still did. That doesn't mean you deserve it. You ruined what could've been a pleasant experience for me and my bf. It looked like you didn't even want to be there in the first place. I got news for you girl, there's plenty of people dying to be in your place right now. And I'm sure that they're going to do a better job than you.  I'm still gonna go to this place, but I'll leave once this server will be my server again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=380

At first I thought, their young and this may be their first job but... Jose G our server was just as rude. He checked on us in passing but so quick I had to ask another young lady for what I wanted. She was sweet but no badge so I don't know her name. My husband was giving Jose his order. I'm digging in my purse. I noticed it got quiet but I was trying to find my hand sanitizer. I then hear, is there anything else or does that complete your order? I look up, I'm like owe, you're done, I'm use to my server asking me directly what I'm ordering. I didn't know you were waiting on me. At the end he handed us our to go boxes. I had to flag another waitress for a bag. Like, Jose where did you go?

Don S.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",152,214,,2.0,8/19/2012,"This is from my visit about a month ago.  I mentioned this on other reviews-- I normally don't do a BAD review for a restaurant, I usually just don't post anything at all since I believe in the American Dream and don't like contributing to others' failure.  But when it comes to big national chains?  Fuck it, I gotta speak on it. Service at this BJ's was not horrible the 2 times I went.  Host and wait staff was fairly friendly.  The real problem was the food.  The pizza I got absolutely sucked major ass.  I mean it was nasty in my mouth.  In fact I fought through half of it because I was hungry and then I just felt like going all Super Model on myself and sticking a finger down my throat to puke it up-- that's how bad I wanted that crap out of me.   It was one of their ""signature"" deep dish pizzas.  But damn, it was bad.  I'm thinking they need to abandon the deep dish format and go with thin crust pies because that doughy half baked mess was not the business.  You have been warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=520
Victoria L.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",36,51,29,4.0,10/20/2015,"Always a treat! This bjs is located at del amo mall, that being said it is usually crowded on weekends. Coming closer to the holidays and following a very recent remodel it's constantly busy. It's about 30-45 minute wait on your average Friday night. That may be their only downfall, how busy they get. I've always had great service and great food. I usually sit at the bar, the service is always great. Jo is fabulous, always keeping the food and drinks coming. They have a great beer selection, including their own collection of beers, two of which I have tried (hefeweizen and pumpkin ale) and they are great! Reasonably priced running about $5 a pint. During happy hour you get a dollar off beer, great deals on appetizers and cocktails (during evening hours I think 9-close/ and during football games) I usually just dine on appetizers while at the bar. One of my favorites is The great beginnings (an appetizer platter) if you are looking to try a few of their different appetizers I would suggest this one. It can easily serve 4 people. Aside from beer, bjs is famous for their delicious pizookie (warm cookie deserts topped with a generous scoop of ice cream) in a variety of yummy flavors. I will definitely be back for a pumpkin ale and pizookie soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=520

Sean S.,"Stanton, CA",56,7,,3.0,11/9/2014,"It was a busy Saturday night, so a wait was expected. We called ahead and only waited 10 min once we arrived. After that, the night kinda fell apart. Our server, Chad, didn't greet us for 10 minutes. Even on a busy night, that's unacceptable. To save us time, we ordered our drinks (soda, tea, water) and dinner at the same time. My mother received her salad before her drink.       The food can and everything was fine. As we neared the end of our meal, I ordered a mini pepperoni pizza to go (no tomatoes, for what it's worth). Chad returned to collect our dishes and said he would come back with the check. I told him to just take my card and he didn't know how to carry it and the dishes (several pockets on his apron, shirt, pants) and not forget my card. Got the pizza and the check and left.     I come to check the pizza today and it was a plain cheese pizza. Not one pepperoni on it. Now, Chad seemed like a nice enough guy and I tipped more than 20%, but he is just not a good server (I was a server/bartender for 8 years).

Nicole B.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,94,,2.0,4/20/2012,"I was holding off on reviewing this place simply because my coworkers and I frequent this place (at least 1-2x's per week) since we work so close and their lunch specials are cheap with a good amount of food, and I didn't want to give them a bad review. But after our experience today, I decided it's time for a review. First, their service has been horrible (at least to us). The servers that we have been getting, particularly this tall white guy with dark hair, have been unpleasant. He comes, takes our order, and disappears. We don't even get refills. We don't see him at all after he takes our order. He only comes 10 minutes after we're done with our food to give us the check. Also, we have had other unpleasant servers, who we literally have to track down in order to have her/him bring us a side of ranch or a refill. Second, the quality of their food over the last 3-5 months have sucked. We have sent back so many dishes. The meat is either undercooked, there is too much dressing in the salad, the fries are too oily and cold, etc. It makes me wonder if they have all new chefs? Third, the past three times that we have ordered appetizers (including today), our appetizers would come out at the same time as our food. Are you kidding me? We always send them back and tell them to take it off the bill. What's the point of an appetizer if we're gonna eat it with our main course? Fourth, the utensils are dirrrty!! They have food crusts all over them, and deep water stains. I wonder if they got a new dish washer. Fifth, we always order a pazooki. This time the cookie was literally attached to the pan. We could not scoop it up no matter how hard we tried. It tasted like crap. I am so surprised, because all it is is  a cookie and ice cream, so how can they mess it up?  Sixth, their service has been soooooooo slow. We order our food right away because we only have a 1.5 hours for our lunch break, but then it takes them a good 30-35 minutes to bring out our food. I wonder why they used to be quick with brining out our food in the past but now it takes them forever. Overall, I am really disappointed. I used to love BJ's and considered them one of my favorite restaurants to go to in the South Bay. However, things have started declining. After our experience today, we decided that we would not be going back there for a long while. Lazy Dog has just as cheap of a lunch menu with quick and better service.

He was on top of refills even when the cups were only halfway empty, he took our orders for appetizers, entree and dessert at the right time, he always kept the table clean by taking finished dishes, and finally he grabbed the check as soon as we were done with it.

Tony D.,"Gardena, CA",1,11,2,2.0,6/23/2012,"SLOW service. It took 45 minutes to get our food. I saw a group that got seated a couple of minutes before us, order lunch, get their food, eat and pay and leave while we were waiting. I think the wait person forgot to put in the order. We didn't order anything that would take too long to prepare.   I ordered the beef dip sandwich. Bread was dry and hard. The sandwich tasted like cardboard. Small size for price. The wedge fries don't taste like they're even made of potatoes.  This is the second time here and it is very cold inside. Feels good at first but sitting there so long my friends had to put on their jackets.  It seems that they don't care about the customer. There was a short wait but no one bothered to write names down to keep track of who came in first so that we could be seated in order. I can see this leading to angering a customer who comes in and watches other groups of the same size who come in after get seated first. I agree with one reviewer. It was busy when we first got there but if BJ's keeps this up they are going to see their customers stop coming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=520

I haven't been to this location in months bc the service and food was terrible for a long time that I quit going here. However my experience last night totally redeemed all of my bad experiences I've had on my previous visits. Joe was our server and he was awesome.. He was very personable and attentive. The food came out timely, came out hot, and delicious. He checked on us a few times through the meal to make sure everything was good and if we needed anything. I let him know about my previous experiences at this location and thanked him for being so great.. And he told me he was a lead trainer. I've had bad experiences with management here, so the fact he went above and beyond was better than the management as well. He totally changed my opinion about the place.

Catherine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,310,38,4.0,7/21/2010,"BJ's in Del Amo has been a go-to place for my high school group when we have our summer reunions.   I always heard about BJ's pizookies (huge cookie with ice cream on top) so I was pretty excited when it first opened. I also frequent this location with my family because they frequently give surveys for free bruchetta or mozzarella sticks on your receipt for your next visit!  Mmm the bruchetta has really fresh tomatoes and has always been a favorite. The bread they give with the bruchetta is also very buttery and crispy. I personally enjoy the balsamic glazed chicken! They give generous portions: two balsamic glazed chicken breasts with buttery mashed potatoes yumm, salad, grilled onions, and fried onion strings on top The chicken is never dry and very flavorful! I've tried most of their pizzas and I'll crave one once in a while, but the chicken is my favorite!! Since everything in Torrance closes pretty early IMO, BJs is a good option since they open late (midnight on weekdays and 1am on weekends).

Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1071,875,388,4.0,1/7/2010,"I've hated BJ's ever since college, when they accidentally threw away my leftovers and rewrapped them when I asked what happened to them. And gave them back to me soggy. Totally disgusting. That was the Westwood location. I am a convert now though. I love this location for lunch because of their lunch specials and because 95% of the time, they are pretty quick. Usually, it's me saying, ""Can we go to BJ's? I really want a baked potato."" People are usually okay with it because of their expansive menu.  So they have lunch specials for around $6 - $9, but my favorite is the half baked potato with soup or salad ($7). You can take your pick of potato from the baked potato list two pages prior to the lunch specials page (I come here a lot, I know). Most of their potatoes come with alfredo sauce, which kind of freaks me out because it's just too much gooeyness for me, so I usually stick with the classic. But today, TODAY, I've found the baked potato of my dreams. The pale ale chili baked potato. O M G. I ordered the regular sized one ($9) because I was starving and didn't really want to fool myself into thinking I even cared about having a salad. The combination of the chili and sour cream and chives was awesome. They even gave you a little side of extra chili. After scraping off every bit of potato, I almost ate the skin. The response from my lunch buddy was, ""Wow. You finished it.""  Hellz, yeah. That is now my potato of choice. I've also been here for happy hour on the weekends, which is a pretty good deal for $2 off appetizers and like $5 mini pizzas or something to that effect, but mostly for lunch. And my alcoholic friends love their selection of beers.

Ordered 2 pazookies, a chocolate chip and a peanut butter birthday pazookie  && it came to us late, and was the wrong flavor.

I asked the person next to me and they weren't to happy either. i guess good things must come to an end.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=540
Eder P.,"Los Angeles, CA",357,609,122,4.0,9/27/2010,"This was my first ever visit to BJ's. I loved the atmosphere and their drink list wasn't extremely impressive, I'm not a huge fan of beer or wine but if you are, you'll love this place. The pizza was awesome and their pazuki (?) was a great way to feel fat. A right out the over cookie with a huge scoop of ice-cream on top. I was upset at the service but that's because our waiter mentioned that another waiter called in sick.

Lisa Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",814,400,1654,2.0,6/1/2014,"This location has really gone downhill. Considering BJ's used to be a restaurant I really enjoyed coming to, I was SOO disappointed with my recent visit. My party ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls as an appetizer to share. The avocados were creamy, but there was really not much else in the rolls.  I didn't taste any sun-dried tomatoes or red onions. Did they forget the pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices? I think the only thing that was listed in the description that was actually on the plate was some cilantro sprinkled on top and the tamarind sauce. I would not get these again. I added a Caesar salad to my entrée, so that came out first. A white, all iceberg lettuce salad. Some of the lettuce was brown and wilted, and there was barely any dressing. There was no taste, and I definitely felt like I wasted my $2.95 to add it to my entrée.  Since they did away with my absolute favorite, Angel Hair Toscana, I was forced to choose another menu item, hoping to get something else that was similar. When I read the description for the Angel Hair Classico, the item they supposedly replaced it with, it just wasn't cutting it for me. So, I decided on the Tuscan Chicken Limone. The chicken was dry. There were two measly clumps of spinach on the side.  Really? THAT is supposed to be my ""fresh steamed baby spinach""?! ( ) Not to mention the garlic bread was hard as a rock. The portions were decently large, but to me it's more about quantity than quality here. I considered giving only 1 star, but the Handcrafted Root Beer was really good. Came in a chilled class, so it made it nice and icy. This was the only good thing that came out of the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=160

Jordan C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/6/2016,"My fiancé and I recently visited BJ's, the Del Amo Fashion Center location and O'BOY where do I begin. Our server was ok; however, our food not so much. We ordered 1 large BBQ chicken pizza and specifically asked for it to be half BBQ / half pepperoni with added pepperoncini's and a salad. We received our food about 20mins later and as I'm eating, there's 2 FREAKING blonde strand of hair in my food (my hair is BLACK)!!!! Grossed out at this point I immediately called the waiter over and showed him what I had found, he took the pizza back and thinking about it I don't recall him ever apologizing for it. Before walking off our server did informed us he would be going on break and another person would be waiting on us. While waiting for our food, this time it took much longer than before, I would've thought since the mistake was on THEIR end they'd rush the order but apparently not.   Our food finally comes out and the order is not the same as our initial order PLUS the pizza looked DRY!! Dry meaning as if it had been sitting back there for a while, which could of happened because like I said, this time it did take much longer for us to get our food! Upon our food arrive we expected to receive our the same order we initially order the first time; however, we RECEIVED a full BBQ chicken pizza with NO pepperoncini's! At this point we were annoyed, irritated and a bit impatient with your staff. What was supposed to be 30min lunch had taken well over an hour; our plans were to catch a movie afterwards but due to the screw ups and waiting games WE MISSED OUR MOVIE!  I did mention to our waitress that our order was incorrect BUT I told her we weren't looking to be here any longer then we had too, so we ended up keeping the order! The mix up and screw ups was just horrible and unfortunately this wasn't the end.  Lastly, we ordered a Pizookie and I specially asked for half chocolate chip and half Oreo.. They still couldn't get it right!!! We received a half WHITE chocolate and Oreo instead of WHAT I ASKED FOR!!! I just couldn't take anymore and was so over it, the miscommunication was beyond me. I'm not sure about others but when I specifically ask for something and PAY MY MONEY for it I expect for it to be what I asked for.

Liz S.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,2,1,2.0,2/26/2017,"I give this place 2 stars not because the food wasn't good but just the experience was not good. We got seated fairly fast but where we sat was the deal breaker. First of all we sat at a table that was half booth and half chair, but the table next to us was so close together that it seemed we were having dinner with the people sitting next to us, there was no space for the person sitting at the booth to get out without bothering the people sitting next to them. Secondly the booth was filthy, looked to my right and there was a corner filled with dust and other trash, which while eating is very unappetizing. Thirdly as I sat down I hit a booster seat which was left underneath the table along with a napkin. Like I understand they're busy but I'm sure a guest would rather wait a few more minutes to receive a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=160

But I'll take your order anyway."" Same server brought food, drinks and utensils over, then pointed to another server (now a ""him"") and said he would be over to introduce himself shortly and take over service for our table.

Michelle G.,"San Pedro, CA",36,8,15,1.0,3/14/2016,"I booked my daughter's first birthday party here back in January for Sunday, March 13. I was told I was the only reservation for 30 for that date, so I would be given the larger outdoor patio. Sold! We were thrilled BJ'S at Del Amo could accommodate. The manager I set things up with, Scott, helped me tour the space and assisted in setting up the most expensive buffet menu for my party of 30. We would be paying close to $30 per person with the extras I requested.  On my way to my party on Sunday at 2:09pm, I was called by the manager on duty that day, Jennifer, who told me that ""instead of the patio your party will be seated inside."" This. Was. Just. The. Beginning.  The girls working at the front desk all need new jobs. My background is in organizational leadership and I train people, much like these employees, how to properly treat customers like they actually mean something to a business. **I have never seen or experienced such attitude from girls at the hostess position** every single one of them working at that location on 3/13/16 from 2-4pm needs to be addressed.  They all wore the ugliest, sour faces, and each one had an attitude to match. The receptionist at 2pm was rude to my sister when she asked about my reservation. They were rude to me when I asked for a glass of water for my thirsty baby. They were rude to my husband when he asked about what the heck happened to our private patio. They were rude to my mother in law when she arrived to the mess of my daughter's first birthday party and began speaking to her like she could not speak English. Fired. The manager straight out lied to my face when I asked what happened to my reserved patio. She told me that ""99% of the time, large parties are specifically assigned the large patio. Your party is just the 1%."" She went on saying that Scott had not told her my party would be on the patio. But over the phone, at 2:09pm, she told me my party would be moving from outside to the inside dining room. Sounds like she did have an idea after all and was trying to cover up their mistake... I spoke with Scott on Friday, 3/11/15 around 12:30pm to finalize my buffet menu. He assured me everything will be taken care of. Come Sunday, minutes before party guests arrive, a large party is seated where my party is supposed to be. They did not have a reservation.  The staff was making a long table for my party in the main dining room, an experience that is completely not what I signed up for. Luckily, there was a smaller patio that was clearing up that could kind of accommodate my needs. Even still, the staff that was helping clean and set up the area gave us attitude when he was WIPING DOWN THE TABLES. Unacceptable. YOUR COMPANY IS THE ONE THAT SCREWED UP. My other kids had to sit outside with my sister at a separate table because they could not all fit in the space, missing out on the party. The ONLY good thing about our experience at BJ's on the day of my event was our server. I forgot his name because he obviously didn't piss me off. He made sure my party had everything we needed.  When you don't put proper customer service training as a high standard, it shows in every element of your business. You need someone to go in and completely retrain your staff on how to treat paying customers with respect.  At the end of the day, the world kept turning, but I will not be returning to this BJ's. I don't want to relive the stress of my baby's 1st birthday. Sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=160
Jeff S.,"Royal Oak, MI",101,273,61,2.0,4/24/2015,"This place is whack.  The service is horrible --- it takes 6-7 people to get you seated and the majority of the servers are mediocre at best. Thankfully, we ended up with one of the better ones.  The first two beers I ordered took at least 10 minutes to show up and both were flat. I had to send them both back and ended up going with a Sam Adams --- so much for the micro brews.  The deep dish pizza tasted frozen and was super doughy. Even with 5-6 toppings, it was tasteless until we added a ton of cracked red pepper and/or hot sauce.  None of the toppings are fresh -- the sausage is basically the same as Pizza Hut or Dominos.  The only reason I'm giving 2-stars instead of one is because of the Pazookie. I suppose it's hard to mess up a giant cookie with ice-cream.  At the end of the day, I dropped $75 bucks for lackluster service and a stomach ache.  This place has been going down hill for years and I'm sorry that I gave it another chance tonight.

Alana M.,"Torrance, CA",1080,545,20018,4.0,4/4/2015,"I have been here only 2-3 times.  The last time was a long time ago because we weren't thoroughly impressed with this place.  My husband had a company lunch here and thought his burger was good, so we came here today, but the funny thing is that nobody ordered a burger!  LOL My experience on our visit on 4/4/15 Our server was very personable and interactive.  The only setback was that when he was gone, he was gone for a while.  I will say that whenever he was tending to us, he was efficient.  The food did take quite a while to arrive, but at least it was a level or two above warm! Items I took bites of: * Ahi Poke Appetizer had a lovely plating!  I wasn't all that impressed with the ahi poke, but it was okay.  The pieces of ahi were a little larger than I like, they were good sized chunks!  The little wonton triangles were cool in the presentation, however, I didn't really need to eat them with the poke. * Clam Chowder was super creamy and thick, New England style.  It had noticeable clam bits in it.  I really appreciate that the soup came out nice and hot. * Chicken Lettuce Wraps were tasty!  I do have a favorite place to get them from, but this was something I'd order again from here.  I think the Sesame Soy Sauce didn't complement the wrap, but I did like the Chinese Mustard! * 16 oz Bone-In New York Steak - steak with choice of 2 sides, we chose roasted asparagus & steamed green beans.  We ordered the steak medium rare, but for some reason, it was overly chewy!  The initial flavor of the steak was really great, but then the steak left a lot to be desired after having to really chew it.  The asparagus was super stringy and too much effort to eat, so we notified the server and he asked us what other side we wanted.  Nice job!!  The green beans were okay, nothing special, but some crispy bacon bits might have added an extra level of flavor to them. * White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes were brought out as a replacement for our asparagus.  Thank you!  And I must add that these are excellent in flavor and texture!   These items I either barely tasted or didn't taste: * Barbeque Pulled Pork Sandwich - pork tossed in their smoked BBQ Ranch Sauce and topped with crispy onion strings * BJ's Barbeque Lunch Platter - a pulled pork slider and a spiced chicken breast, crispy‑thin seasoned fries, & coleslaw * Soup & Salad Combo (Caesar Salad & Chicken Tortilla Soup) - they don't offer the UNLIMITED combo on the weekends.  I thought the soup was too acidic for my liking.  I did pick out some of the avocado pieces along with the tortilla strips.  The server poured the soup on top of the accompanying toppings as soon as he was in front of us.  That was pretty cool!  I like the lime wedge which is speared so you can grab it easily.  (   ) * Carnitas Fries sans Cilantro - shredded pork with roasted green chili sauce and a mixture of jack and cheddar cheese which is topped with freshly chopped onions.  The plating of this is unique, it comes in a metal pan.  Money & Time Saving Tips: 1) They have a Movie & A Meal Deal, where you buy a movie ticket for $8.00 with any purchase.   2) There is a BJ's App, and by using it, you can view wait times & move up in line from anywhere, it offers Mobile Pay, and you can place your order in advance to dine in. 3) Premier Rewards Program - it is free to join.  You earn 1 point per dollar spent on just food & non-alcoholic beverages.  With 100 points, you can get a FREE Pizookie!  Go to their website to learn more. I wasn't really a true fan of anything I ate here today.  In the past I have had a pizza and think I would go that route next time I come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=160

EnLIGHTened Veggie Omelette with side of fruits ($8.95): Prices are a tad bit cheaper than I would normally see for brunch options elsewhere. The taste of the food was very sub par. My omelette had some excess liquid running off - substituted the feta cheese for pepperjack. Overall the dish was only 300 calories so I can't complain!

The ahi poke was kind of tasteless this time, though it has been good in the past.  My daughter really liked the spaghetti with marinara and my husband said the small veggie deep dish pizza was good as well.  I like that they have calories on the menu, but there is almost nothing the least bit healthy or under 1,000 calories.  I will say again that the beer is very good, so if you want to just sit at the bar and drink beer, the service is probably better and the beer is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=500

S N.,"Long Beach, CA",45,131,,2.0,11/26/2012,"This is my second experience at a BJ's in 2 months as I had a gift card I wanted to use up. The first was in the Huntington Beach Bjs where I had the worse Mohitoes on the planet-yes I've had them in Cuba so know what I am talking about. Anyhoo this second visit in Torrance for my bf birthday-he actually requested the place as he likes the pizza- was only a little better. Since the first visit was one star for their tasteless ""signature drink"" and this second visit was 3 stars I  will balance it out to two stars. Ahem-We went to the Torrance Bj's last Sat night at 645 pm. Parking was tough but free and security everywhere. The place was packed and the wait was told to be 45 min. Rather than wait my bf suggested we lurk in the bar for someone to leave as they serve the same food in there anyway so we did just that and scored a table immediately. I asked our waitress to wipe our table and she ignored me.  But she was busy so ok. That's cool. What is the real travesty is the pizza. My bf was raging about this places pizza as being the best in the world.  He ordered my fav toppings hoping I would agree. We got their special which was pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and tomato. It  had no toppings what to speak of. I mean 5 peperoni if that and the cheese was non existent. I must say though I enjoyed the crust immensely and since it was all crust that was a blessing. I also enjoyed my Malbec very much and the beer selection is indeed very good.  However, we went there for pizza and even my guy who loves this place was disappointed and it was his bday which really upset me.   After we finished our ""crust"" we noticed our neighbors got the exact same pizza and they had 3 times the toppings. We were pretty pissed seeing that. Since I had never had their crust that they try to pass off as pizza I did not know I had grounds to gripe but after seeing our neighbors pizza I was experiencing some mad pizza envy as did my birthday sweetie.  We  used up my gift card in full and proceeded to go see a movie next door, fb bday cheesecake at home. It was a super nice evening but BJ's food and service had nothing to do with it.

Clifford P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,101,,3.0,1/20/2013,"Came here on a Saturday night around 9pm and the place was packed. Waited about 35 minutes for a table, but I guess that's to be expected on a Saturday night. Once seated, things moved fairly quickly. While waiting to be called, we took a look at the menu and already made our dining choices, so once we sat down, we were able to order our drinks and entrees at the same time. If you're pressed for time, I highly recommend this, as our food arrived quickly, and we were able to eat and leave in less than an hour. Having been to other BJ's, I was happy to see that the Torrance location offered a much wider selection than other locations. Some of the selections our table ordered were soup &  salad, a deep dish pizza, and the rib eye steak. All the dishes were well prepared and service was superb even though the place was packed. One note. We noticed a sign on our table that if you join the BJ's Premier Rewards program, you're allowed to make reservations at their restaurant, rather than waiting for a table after you arrive. We didn't sign up for this since we weren't sure how ofter we'd be back, but if you're a regular or thinking about becoming one, it sounds like it would be worth joining just for the ability to make reservations, not to mention any other perks that come with membership.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=500

Obichang O.,"Honolulu, HI",100,38,122,5.0,7/18/2013,"I hadn't heard about BJ's before but was glad to have been introduced to this chique, sportsbar-esque California chain. The service here is really friendly and helpful and patient with to talk story and explain menu items and options. The alcohol selection is incredibly expansive, including a wide variety of California and international beers, a nice selection of wives and a large collection of spirits. If the beer choices are too expansive, the staff is more than happy to give you reading samples, or if you'd rather make your own exploration, there is a beer-tasting item on the menu that offers one ounce samples of your choice of any four beers. They also offer a selection of cocktails and mocktails to suit even discriminating tastes. The food menu is huge and covers every facet of American cuisine. I like to judge based on the salads - a simple concept that can be mind-blowing if care and creativity are used. I selected the mango salad because it seemed exotic and strange to me - it ended up being amazing beyond comprehension. The mangoes  compliment tree fairly standard salad by offering a light sweetness that enriches the.flavor of the vinaigrette and the diced tomatoes. in fact, the salad really triples as an appetizer, entree and dessert.  BJ' s service motto is to never lose a customer and I think they take that challenge brilliantly in their service ideals and their approach to amazing food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=500

Ally F.,"Compton, CA",28,65,17,3.0,6/23/2013,"Our server, Jessica H. was really nice, drinks refilled before asking...but in other areas of customer service...needs improvement... I think. Here's our experience -- My nephew decided to order the teriyaki chicken plate, but instead of rice, he just wanted fries. I ask him, ""Are you sure? Teriyaki chicken NO rice?"" He told Jessica, ""Yeah I don't want rice, can I get fries instead?""  Jessica nodded, ""Sure, besides our rice isn't the bomb here, it's terrible, so better you get the fries."" A long while later, we finally get our food. My husband, son, and I all liked our dishes. But not the nephew. They put the teri chicken all over the fries lol. I told him, well, that's what you ordered.  Seriously tho, what cook would put a slathering of teri chicken on top of fries? After the nephew kept making all kinds of faces giving us hints he didn't like his plate, my husband took the neph's plate, and gave him half his hamburger and fries.  I tried the food on my neph's plate. It was awful, there was hardly any chicken. I saw mostly vegetables. If there was chicken I didn't see it was drowning in their terrible teriyaki sauce.  Jessica came by again and asked how the food was. We told her the teriyaki chicken was terrible, we weren't going to eat it, and we wished we had specified the fries to be put on the side. She shrugged and said, ""Yeahhh, it's not that good, but to be honest, that probably tastes even better than if you had it over rice."" Shrugged again and walked away. Soooo...she ended up taking away a full plate of untouched teriyaki chicken-covered fries. I didn't ask to return the plate because it's what the nephew ordered. and he's 18...if he wanted something else he should've said something. But at the same time, I really wanted our server to do something other than shrug and agree that the food sucks. Like really? Can you please take off that $14 charge perhaps?  Oh well.

I enjoy deep dish pizza, if you don't, this is not for you. The service gets no stars. Over half the times I've been here they get something wrong.  One time they got my pizza wrong 3 times. Simple order; Medium pizza with meatballs, no tomatoes. First the bring out a pizza with peppers. Then they bring out a pizza with only pepperoni. Next they bring out a pizza with meatballs and tomatoes. 3 wrong order out of 3. By that time i was starving and just picked the tomatoes off and ate it. The manager came over and gave us free soup and a free pizookie for dessert. It was a nice gesture and appreciated but the service is always bad and the orders are always wrong. It can also get to be a very long wait for a table. I suggest calling ahead. They do not take reservations but they will put your name in on a call in.

Upon asking for an extra side order of the garlic bread, a long, hair-like material was on the bread--which I discovered upon biting into it. The waiter took this issue to the manager who only came by to say that the hair-like material wasn't hair but a long thread of lint which was most likely from one of their towels. He only offered more bread or perhaps a dessert. Very poor customer service. I wasn't looking to get my meal comp'd but after ruining my meal, it would seem appropriate that the manager of this establishment take adequate measures to amend this situation--more than assuring that it wasn't hair, but a long piece of lint from their towels.

Well, this is one of the chain places that I can depend on for good food, service and well, countless other things. They have a great amount of televisions all over the place so I can always get a good glance at the score of games. They're pretty nice and accomendating about the games too.  So the food, each time we've gone - we always try to get something new but there's just so much on the menu. Really, it's a pretty diverse piece of work.  We just went last night which is pretty much why I had to check if I had reviewed this place. I had the clam chowder bowl which was okay. The bowl and soup wasn't that great but for some reason the top part of it was buttered and grilled? Delicious! I love their wedge salads here. I love them anywhere. They're pizzas are delicious and just such a great size to share between two.  My boyfriend usually gets something different every time and something extreme to something not, either way - he's always happy.

I've eaten at numerous Bj's locations from our hometown in Woodland Hills, to Cerritos, to Valencia, to here in Torrance so I'm just going to put all my experiences into one review. What I like to order here: -BBQ beef sandwich with wedged fries -Parmesan chicken w/ mashed potatoes & broccoli -Deep Dish Pizza (any is good..tried the hamburger one recently-tasted like a burger lol) -Caesar salad -Bruschetta (NomNom..) -Spinach artichoke dip..must have. -Avocado eggrolls -Santa Fe Spring Rolls -Fettuccine alfredo w/ chicken  -Pizoooookies! One time my family ordered a oreo/peanut butter/macadamia nut/chocolate chip pizookie platter. It was DEADLY. YUM YUM YUM. The pizookie is Bj's signature dessert. It's a MUST to order here every time you come. Please don't bother buying the garlic bread here as an appetizer. Unless spending $5 on 3 slices of bread is completely fine with you. Do they still even have them as appetizers on the menu? This was a couple years back. My best friend & I always come to this location before we burn off all our calories shopping at Del Amo mall. I can't even count the many times she's gotten hit on over here. One time when we were having lunch, this guy who I thought was our server kept stopping by our table to give us whatever we needed; then I realized he wasn't even our waiter & all of a sudden all these waiters were surrounding our table trying to have a conversation...then he ended up giving my best friend his number. Sorry dude, your breath smelled BUNK! She never called you :( Sorry. My boyfriend loves their beer here. My dad does his best to get him as drunk as possible. Dad orders pitchers full & the beer sampler too. Mark's not a huge drinker, but he likes their hefeweizen. And I remember him saying the Nutty Brewnette tasting like a mix of herbal tea & chocolate & other stuff...gross. I'm not a fan of beer nor do I drink alcohol as much. Oh yeah, there's a full bar. They have happy hour but I forgot what time it's always at. This location is smaller than most I've been to; it gets pretty packed during dinner time / weekends. Loud especially on game nights.

Just like I've also been to 5 star restaurants where I've had 5 start service too , so I'm sure I know how I'm supposed to be treated and how long my food is supposed to take on a tuesday night! i would have waited 2 hours if the waiter would of kept the drinks coming and checking up on us! the fact that he didnt have our food was not a reason to ignore us !!  All I can say stay away front this place !!!!!!!! This was my first and last time at a Bjs restaurant , never again will I enter this place . Save yourself the bad moment and go to a better place for basically the same price, I can't deny the food was tasty but the service was the worse I've had !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=600
Tiffany C.,"Gardena, CA",120,4,,1.0,9/16/2011,"Just came here last saturday night and it was a horrible dinner. First it was an hour wait just to get a cramped spot in a corner booth when it was 5 of us. Then it was and hour wait for them to serve our food! They served one plate, then two more. When the other two came, it was all screwed up! smfh. Not to mention my spagetti was cold and lacked much flavor.  Can you say Disaster? The manager had to come atleast 3 times, and solved nothing. 3 diff waiters and they were clueless. What really topped it off was when we get the bill, they charged double for the order they messed up and said they took off 1. Noooo they really didnt, they just wanted to get the money for it anyway thinking we wouldnt check. After all of that, all they give us is a $20 GIFTCARD (as if I'll ever be back), and we simply gave them exact change.   HORRIBLE A** PLACE!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=600
Lorri N.,"Lawndale, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/4/2013,"Tonight we discovered what it was like to just get up and leave a resturant because apparently we were invisible. After entering  BJ's Torrance at 5:00pm we were seated, and that is when we became invisible. Servers walked right by us to take orders for the newly seated tables next to us, but ignored us as we tried to get thier attention. On the third pass we stopped the waitress and mentioned our concern and her reply was that we were not her table. So out of three tables next to one another, we were in the wrong spot. She didn't offer to help us, just left us there. We waited for another 5 min and then decided to get up and leave. What the restaurant has transformed into over the past six months has been a gradual decline in service, food quality and helpful attitude by it's staff. The management had better wake up and focus on what it takes to make customers come back...they have lost the focus and sadly that leads to...customer invisibility.

The restaurant is large and I've never had to wait for a table at lunch time.  But, the service can be very slow.  The only way to get in and out in less than an hour is to put your food order in right away with the drinks.  And, the pizzookie can take some time to make, so if you're in a hurry, ask for it before you finish your entree!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=600
Sylvia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,95,1,3.0,5/25/2011,I'm generally a fan of a lot of the food that they have at BJ's. I've never had any problems with any of the food at this location - always good. This place is just always PACKED though. And the waiting area is pretty small considering how packed it always is. They also seem to run out of the pagers when I'm there and there's no room to wait inside so we have to wait outside and go back and check when they tell us to. The service here is slow. They aren't mean or bad but it's just slow. Takes a while for your server to come to your table and takes a while for your order. It always seems like they are a bit short staffed. It's also unbelievably slippery in there. I seriously am scared to go in there sometimes if I'm wearing the wrong shoes because maneuvering yourself to get to the table without falling on your face seems like way too much trouble.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=600

I of course chose to grab a beer at BJ's.  The place beats the heck out of the depressing lounge area of the auto center and they have a good selection of craft beers. They had a belgian that I wasn't familiar with ""Maredsous 8"" Really good stuff.  The food on the other hand was pretty blah. I had the angus sliders. Pretty f-ink bland. The fries we're nice but the little burgers could have used some help. Meh, thats why I normally don't do the chains for food.  So in summation my little wet nosed puppies.

Lisa M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1078,909,1293,2.0,12/20/2008,"So I love BJs. Their pizza, beer, potato wedges, love the food. I have to say though, I've been here maybe half a dozen times since it's opened, and this particular branch's service SUCKS. With a capital S. The last time I was here, I came on a Thursday night and the wait was over an hour long. I was already irritable from watching people eat when I was starving, so by the time we were seated it felt like my stomach was eating itself. Our waitress started out nice and competent enough, but taking our order was the only thing she did right. She forgot to bring the bf's beer, and didn't even remember it until she brought the check and realized her mistake. AND she didn't apologize!! ""Oh did I ever bring you your beer? hmmmm oops."" Oops? how nice.  Now, we know how the service for the pizza is supposed to work because another previous dining experience got us a free pizookie for POOR service again. When you order pizza, your waiter is supposed to bring you the pizza stand and plates right away. Our waitress neglected to do this. Also when they bring the pizza, they're supposed to cut it up and put it on the plates for you. If you try to do it yourself, the pizza gets all messed up, which is what happened to us. The manager saw us struggling and apologized, saying it's the server's job to do that for us. SOOO of course our waitress didnt do that, nor did she offer to help us when we were once again struggling. We had to ask her for her help, and she seemed pissed that we even bothered her. When she brought the check, we only got one copy of the receipt. No customer's copy. Coooooooooooooooooool. We were looking for the manager to super complain about how crappy of a dining experience this was, and HE was nowhere to be found either. I don't think I've ever had worse service than this. Ever.

Mike S.,"Lomita, CA",56,36,8,2.0,2/24/2014,"This rating is really a toss up of a 1 or a 2 star for me...I have been here a few other times with my wife and some friends, and the last time we were in a big group(over 10 people) it wasnt bad, not great, but wasnt bad.... The last time it was my wife and son, it was horrible...We called to make a reservation, told on the phone there will be no wait.  When we got there it was a ten minute wait, totally not a big deal.  We got seated and few our son his dinner, as he wont eat the stuff on their menu, and we sat there.  He ate his entire dinner and no one came up to us.  I went to the front and asked if they had a record of when were were seated, we were there for over 20 min and not one person stopped at our table.  I let them know we were leaving and went to get my wife and son.  On the way out the Manager was at the front and blocked us off asking if there was an issue, I was very cordial in telling him that no one stopped at our table and when he asked who the server is I told him I do not know as everyone walked by.  He said if we sat down right now he would get us a waiter. I told him no need as my wife and I were very hungry and tired and were just going home...I called a few days later, not to complain, but to give feedback and let them know what happened.  The manger I talked to had no idea, and really didnt seem to interested, but offered a girft card to us to come back, and I told him that we probably were not coming back in again, he insisted on sending them anyway.  Gave him my address, never got anything (I will not hold this part to him as I dont know if he sent them or not, and if they got lost in the mail)    That was close to a year ago...last week some friends wanted to get together for dinner and  BJs was brought up...had my doubts, but majority rules... We got there a little late and the other couple was already there and had ordered drinks/appetizers...The waitress came up and brought water for us, didnt ask about appetizers...took our orders, and walked away.  the other couple finished their drinks and she took the glases and didnt ask if they wanted more. Our food was brought out by other staff...Everything looked good, couldnt eat it though as the first couple were the only ones with silverware....at this point we havent seen out waitress in about 15 min.  She came out a few minutes later and asked if everything was ok, and that she was going on break.  so we are eating and talking about the service and we are all really let down as if brought the meal down for us.  Our temp wiater who had his own tables though really picked it up for us, checked in every few minutes, asked questions, everything...Our son didnt eat his meal, and the guy took it off the bill, even though i said it was totally fine and not his fault, he still did that.  Then after were were done with desert, the waitress was back on and gave us the bill...The big debate shot up, what do we give for a tip...and how does it get split...we werent sure what the deal was so i took the bill with the money for it to the front... I talked to a hostess about paying and was told it has to be with the server, when I explained that i wanted to plait the tip, I was directed to the manager.  I explained that i did not want to give her much as we felt she didnt deserve it...he didnt really seem to be interested in what i had to say, and let me know that the original server gets the tip, when he took the bill from me he asked what was in it, and I told him strictly the bill only and i wanted to pay the other waiter..he walked over to our table area, and just gave it to the waiter and walked away from me, never talking to me about how to split the tip.....a little discouraging from my view.... I went to the next step, and asked our waited about how to tip him and if we were allowed to, he said yes.  I told him why we were tipping him and the differences in the service.  I also told him that i would be giving his tip to the manager and he could get it from him.   Walked up to the manager on the way out and handed it to him and told him there were two tips.   He took it, said have a good night and walked the other way.... Not asking that something be done on the bill, but at least take the couple minutes to talk to me as a customer....I usually give a second chance to places, but not really in this case....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=620
Jake W.,"Redwood City, CA",108,472,21,3.0,4/2/2011,"I often come here for lunches with big groups that I work with.  I usually get the burger (if the company is paying for it) or one of the very affordable lunch specials. If you like pan pizzas, the ones here are pretty decent.  I'm not a big fan of that style, so my experience only lies in the tasting of my friend's pies. The sandwiches are good, but nothing too special.  If you do the 1/2 sandwich and side salad (the wedge, I believe has no redeeming health benefits, but is delicious), it's a pretty good deal ($6.99 if I recall correctly).  The thin fries (I haven't tried the other kind) are good (although not worthy of their own paragraph in my review). What takes this chain restaurant (I'm not usually a chain restaurant kind of guy) from two to three stars is a desert they have called a ""Pizookie"".  Know that it takes a few minutes to make, so if you're in a rush, try to order it early.  Basically, it's a big cookie, cooked in a pan with ice cream on top.  The cookies are always hot and soft (never overcooked in my experience).  I recommend the Oreo or Chocolate chip, but I don't think you can go wrong here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=620

Drinks took forever to come as she said she was waiting for the bartenders. Servers name I believe was Ginger. Well drink orders finally came but only wine and the glasses of water that my in laws asked for with their wine. Still no beer..few minutes later we got the beer then the appetizers..got the fried calamari which was just ok and the sliders appetizers..well we all were surprised when there was only two sliders and the menu said 4. So the server finally came back and we told her we thought the sliders came with four and her response was ""oh I'm not sure if it does..let me check for you"" already bad that the server doesn't even know the menu..but also I asked where my baby's dinner was. She said ""oh yes"" basically saying she forgot.. In between that my father in law ordered a soup for his dinner and it came out right after the appetizer with not even enough time to take a bite of the apps. She ""found out"" about the sliders and said "" oh I'm sorry the kitchen accidentally sent out a kids meal sliders and that they will get our other two out right away."" Well a few minutes later my babies food came out and then shortly after our dinners came out. Followed by the dinners the other two cheeseburger sliders came out but without cheese or lettuce or tomato or the pickles it was supposed to come with..server didn't come to check how everything was but to just introduce her co worker because she was going on break..new server asked if we were plans my in law asked for the cheese and tomatoes and lettuce that was supposed to come with the sliders..he quickly said ok and they proceeded to be next tables to introduce still almost done with most of our food the slice of cheese and piece of lettuce arrived nothing else and he just dropped it then left. No pickles, no tomatoes and not a word. Well the baby was already getting restless as her food was late and she was just getting tired so we were waiting forever for any plates to be cleared and asked for boxes..when we asked for 2 boxes still none of the plates were cleared and we waited almost 15 minutes for boxes..but it made sure to drop the check as soon as he brought them over and never asked if we wanted anything else dessert or anything mind you it was my boyfriends birthday dinner..well my father in law was already upset as were we and he just put the card in and my mother in law actually had to place it in the servers hand as he was walking by or who knows how long we would've had to wait to get it processed..when he brought it back I decided to look over the bill to see if I could find out what really happened as I am a PIC at a restaurant.. Basically a manager. Didn't see much on the check but the fact that we were charged for the cheese even though it was supposed to be included with our sliders..as we were leaving my in laws decided that they wanted to speak to manager because of all the terrible service and the extra charge and the fact that no one stopped by our table after the slider incident..well we were up front waiting to speak to a manager and about 10 minutes later both managers are at the hostess desk and the hostesses tell the woman manager that we would like to speak to them and the. She proceeded to get this nasty look on her face and rolled her eyes as she walked up to my in laws..unaware that I could see her face before she walked up to them as we were standing separately because of the stairs..sad that all around nothing was done but an insincere apology.. Terrible experience and sad that we came for a birthday celebration..you should really work on customer service and make sure there is teamwork and managers need to stop by every table no matter what but especially if there was an issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=620

The Jambalaya and a brewhouse blonde. They have several beers that taste great but the brewhouse blonde is just the perfect simple beer. Pair it with the Jambalaya and its the perfect marriage of spicy and refreshing. The restaurant is comfortable for a get together as well as sports with friends.

Ok, now that I've got that out of the way... onto the rest of my review... Aside from that, their entrees are phenomenal. All their pizza's are awesome! And I'm a big fan of their pot roast sandwich. Huge portions! I've yet to try one of their giant stuffed baked potatoes, but I've seen other people order them. My God!... I've never knew potatoes could be that big. It looks like you'd need a cart (or crane) to move that thing. ""Giant"" is an understatement. A more accurate description might be ""Godzilla of Spuds"". And for you drink lovers, they have several of their own handcrafted brews on tap. I highly recommend getting the sampler sets, which will let you sample all the different kinds. My personal favs are their ""Nutty Brewnette"" and ""P.M' Porter"". Aside from their awesome decor, they bar has a wall of flat screen TV's behind it, each one showing a different channel. Great viewing for any sports fan. The wait time can be pretty lengthy during peak hours. This is just one of those unfortunate consequences of going to a place that pulls in a lot of patronage.

""Let's just go to panda express or something,"" said the co-worker. ""Damnit, I want a beer!""  So the alcohol wins.  We wait. And boy do we wait.... An hour later, we get a waiter. An hour sitting on a booth watching waiters pass us by. No, they weren't short-staffed, because most of them were standing waiting to be assigned to a certain table. Well you would think the staff is smart enough to service those who need yet to order. But they just watch you sit and bitch. It doesn't matter when you order, since waiting for your meal takes an hour.  ""I hate to sound like a fat woman at a buffet, but how long is it going to take for a pizza and a chicken salad?""

But 15 mins... you would think they were just preparing it. We got a medium hawaiin pizza and a chicken ceasar salad. They're not amazing pizzas-just cheese, sauce and your toppings of choice, duh. But they're cooked to perfection. Crust isn't thick nor thin...it's just my kind of pizza. The ceasar salad is your regular salad, but I love the large portion that can feed 2-3 people.  Their service however, ruined the meal. Took them longer to give us the bill, all the while I was still waiting for the second beer.

It's baked in it's own dish as opposed to being scooped out of a larger dish in the traditional sense.  The top had a candied type crunch you would get for a creme bruelle top.  It was a good dessert, but to call it a cobbler was a bit of a reach.  I would say it was more of a small pie without the top crust.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=680

Their barbecue pizza puts CPK's to shame. The pizookie is delicious. I'd recommend you'd get one, only if you have someone to share it with. The salmon teriyaki is also delicious.

Something like 14 televisions in the place with several not being watched and they couldn't put my game on one of them so I left... Went next door to Lazy Dog Cafe and what a different experience. Bartender saw me looking at the screens and asked me what game I was looking for. He went out of his way to find a television that he could put it on for me.  And they introduced themselves to me by name and personally took responsibility for me having a good experience which I did.

No call to me and the several times that I called them, they just kept stating that it would be out.

A few times, wait times have been short, food came out exactly how we wanted it, and service was great. Sometimes though, our name never gets on the all ahead list (which seems to happen a lot) or our server sucks. One time, we had a large party and we asked the server to split the checks since half of us were paying with a card and half of us were paying with cash. She refused and then said if we just told her how much we wanted on each card, she could just do it that way. We said okay, that's fine. So, we wrote down each card and how much money was to be put on it, and we wrote down how much in cash we were giving her so that the total would come out correctly. When we got the check back, we saw that she hadn't paid attention to that at all, and instead had taken ALL the cash as her tip, and overcharged everyone on their cards. Yeah, that's why we wanted split checks! Also, I do takeout a lot and service is also hit or miss there too. Some of their takeout servers are very rude and others are very nice. It depends on who you get I guess. Also, don't do their curbside service. We did it once and it took them 20 minutes to come out to the car. Wtf is that. That's pretty typical too.

Margaret N.,"Gardena, CA",210,83,4,3.0,6/26/2008,"The restaurant's pretty cool.  This BJ's opened on Monday at the Del Amo outdoorsy section.  Noticed that Jerry's Deli was open across the walkway as well!  We came for happy hour in the bar area today and it was pretty crowded.  I noticed that there were quite a few parties waiting for tables in the dining room around 6:45.  Who knew Torrance was so poppin'?  The bar area had seats along the bar, some booths (nice!), and tables.  They even had chairs lined up against the wall so you could partake in the happy hour specials without having to cop a table.  The waitstaff and bartenders were buzzing around, quick and attentive. Happy hour is from 3-7 and 10-midnight.  Specials include $1 off drafts and wine (a large selection of drafts at that!), $2 off appetizers (ranged in regular price from $7-15), and 1/2 off mini pizzas--these thick, 5-6 inch diameter, Chicago-esqe pies with various topping combinations. My Blue Moon was $3.95, not terrible.  Checked out the beer menu and saw that they carried some specialty beers--Chimay, Lindemans, and the like.  They also did tastes of their beers on draft.  A cute, skinny 3-4 oz glass would be $1.50, and I think 4 or 5 tastes were $5.50.  A fun way to get your drink on without getting stuck with something you thought looked good but then grew tired halfway down the glass, leaving the beer to get warm and..yeck, I just grossed myself out a little.   I ordered the sliders and wedge fries ($7 regular price) and ate off the appetizer platter ($15 regular price), which offered a sampling of the spinach artichoke dip, santa fe spring rolls, mozzarella sticks, and avocado egg rolls.  The sliders were OK, I'd order them sans fries if I got them again.  Came in a stack of 4, kinda tasty with the diced onions incorporated into the patties.  The appetizer platter was nice.  Pretty much 4 of everything and their respective sauces plus a cup of the dip and tortilla chips in the middle.  Served with a sweet and tangy sauce, the avocado egg rolls were a definite standout.  Avocado, cream cheese, sun dried tomatoes, onions, cilantro, chipotle--creamy, rich, yet spicy!  Pretty freakin' good. As we left, even more parties were congregated around the hostess booth.  I noticed they were sitting around with small plastic plates--samples of the pizza while you're waiting?  Why thank you, don't mind if I do!  (Well, I didn't get a sample, that's a mental note for next time.)  I think I'd come here again for late night dining.  And with Jerry's across the way?  A lot faster than driving out to MDR.  Always looking for spots in the South Bay to get my late night grub on.  Terrible, I know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=780

Joseph H.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,103,23,1.0,11/14/2011,"Ate here on a Saturday night as a friend was visiting from the Bay Area. He was down in Orange County so I settled on a half-way meeting at a risk-free place. I should have found a Cheesecake Factory. I will never eat at anothe BJs again. This location at 9PM was heavily populated by 8th graders and teenagers. They behaved themselves, but I just thought you should know, if you were considering going here for something closely resembling romance (and if you were, you need to check yourself). Our server was overloaded. I don't blame her for taking 10 minutes to give me a water refill to the point where I had to walk to the host-island and ask someone to fill it themselves. But it did piss me off (but I didn't take it out of her tip). Who were worse, and ensured I won't step foot in here or another BJ's again (as an econ professor in college put so poetically: there is no reason to return to a bad restaurant when there is so much market competition) were the male servers. I only took one trip to the men's bathroom but had to literally dodge two of them invading my personal space by walking macho - one on the way there who was ready to run me over with a tray of food, and another on the way back as I was turning the corner, as if he was running a red light. Let me try to tell you the impression both of these gave me: if these two guys behaved this way to me on the streets, they would do it expecting to start a fight. Why on Earth would you give a patron the impression you not only don't give a damn about them, but that in another time and place, you are actually starting shit? Who on Earth employs such people?  I don't care that you are working at 9PM on a Sat. night. I don't care how overworked you are and that you don't get paid enough. Who hasn't felt that way before? Only losers don't rise above it and perform their job with class instead of passively-aggressively taking it out on someone (me) who doesn't think its worth it to knock your tray of food onto the floor to prove my point. Or maybe you were looking for that so you could get take out your anger at me instead of at the gym?  They were not doing their job of ""treating"" a guest, and BJ's isn't either by employing disrespectful thugs with aprons. As if the manager there gives a shit.

There was an inexplicable crowd for a Wednesday night, and even though we only had two people in our party, we still had to wait.  Apparently the par-tay in Torrance is at BJ's.  My friend was a bit late, though, so it worked out just fine.  I thought it would be really huge inside, but it's actually pretty small -- hence the wait, I guess?  It's really loud inside. Our waitress was good but very inexperienced and couldn't answer our questions (she just started last week).  At least she was attentive, though.  I ordered a grilled chicken potato with NO alfredo sauce, and she was aghast.  (""No alfredo sauce?  That's the best part!""  ""No, I don't like alfredo sauce."")  Haha.  The potato was decent, and was the size of a small child's head.  I could only eat half.  I like BJ's own brews, so I had the Nutty Brewnette, a good dark ale.

Chad H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",41,75,110,4.0,9/24/2010,"I'll preface this review by saying I'm a homebrewer and thus am partial to going to places that make their own beers. I'll further preface by saying I am aware this particular place doesn't brew their beers onsite... I come here for lunch every couple of weeks or so. It doesn't disappoint. They have a really good lunch deal going on--food items between 6-10 bucks and their beers for $3. Pure genius to do 'happy hour' during lunch. God bless the Brits for that little import (for believing it's ok to have a drink at lunch, not happy hours). So now that we've established that a beer at lunch is socially acceptable- and that if that beer is of the proprietors it's even better- back to the review: The bar staff are always friendly and know more about beer than I'd expect from a chain restaurant. They'll know the abv of the beers and be able to talk about hop and malt character of beers. And you should care about this even if you aren't a beer fan but just drink it casually. Why? Because then you'll learn what you like better over time! So why not 5 stars? The food is solid but nothing earth shattering and the beers don't push the boundaries. They are quaffable but that's it.

So we decided to order to go. I walked up to the counter after the previous customer walked away to order but the 2 cashiers started a convo. Stood there for a minute and the cashier in front of me finally asked ""what did you need?"" .... (Who asks that at a take out counter?) The other cashier kept talking to the one that was taking my order so she kept asking me ""what was it?"" and ""can you repeat it again?"" Horrible. Last time servers were very attentive... These ladies were just straight out rude. We ended up waiting 50 minutes for 2 pizookies; We saw 2 brought out but 1 was placed in someone else's order, so I thought, oh, not ours. We waited and waited...  I finally lost my patience and confronted another waiter. He apologized and rushed into the kitchen. He finally came out with the remaining pizookie and we were on our way. The ice cream for the first pizookie was melted, unfortunately, from sitting on the counter for 20 minutes....

Seating is adequate although some tables situated in a row are a bit compactly fitted especially when they are trying to shoe horn in a high chair between the tables. Most of the dishes I have sampled were pretty tasty especially the pulled pork sliders and flat bread pizza. Their beer selection is vast. Although the last time I went there they tried to pass off one of their brews as a Guinness. pretty evident it was not a Guinness: lack of the traditional foamy head and it had a very bitter taste. My guess would be their porter or stout. Very disappointed in that. Otherwise service was good. Contacted BJS for a reply on their questionable practice by the bartender. Could have been an honest error but......Still have not heard from them. It's now been over a week ago since I wrote to them. Their website states ""Our genuine commitment is to take pride in passionately connecting with every guest, on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail during every shift -- to create and keep fanatical fans of BJ's concept and brand.""

No, literally, it will probably kill you with chocolate goodness if you try to eat the entire thing. It is one of the most rich desserts I've ever had and wonderful. The place can be a little loud when packed (especially if a game is on) but I think that should be expected for a good brewhouse. You don't really want a bunch of silent people sitting around drinking beer do you? That'd be a little depressing... As someone in a wheelchair, the seating is pretty nice (no pun intended.).

We ended up at BJs, since none of us had been to the Del Amo location, and we were seeing ""Legion"" there (word about the movie: don't.)  I was pleasanly surprised how large and airy BJs was...my last experience with them being numerous years ago in Brea, and I remember hating it. But the server (can't remember his name, really nice guy, very good) was attentive, and the food was pretty gosh-darned decent. I have to say I am NOT A FAN of BJs pizza, but that is okay, because I didn't order it. I don't like deep-dish pizza, just not my thing.  I got the Tuscan tomato bisque and a wedge salad, and you know what? That amount and portion was just perfect. The soup was really good...it looked like it could have been super salty (and according to the nutrition guide on the back, should have been), but it wasn't. The wedge salad was great, and fairly nutrious (considering) as well. I really like that the nutrition guide is listed at the back of the menu...it saves you the trouble of thinking, ""God, will I need to workout like five days this week to work this off?"" I just knew what I was eating would take about two days to work off. See? Time saved! It's a fun place...loud, but in a busy-anticipatory kind of way. We had a corner booth, which was perfect...allowed us to people-watch, and tv watch as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=760
Andrei T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",50,4,,2.0,10/30/2010,"I have been to BJ's on a few different occasions. This particular location (Redondo Beach) had better customer service than the one in the San Fernando Valley (Victory and Canoga I believe).  My lady and I ordered a deep dish pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. She selected a Coke as her beverage and I decided to try the Jeremiah Red Beer.  The beer was not smooth at all; it had some kind of yeast taste to it and smelled like a wet dog. I had to rinse my mouth with some water and ordered some jack and coke. The server lagged forever, and then he finally showed up with the pizza only. I took a deep berth and explained I was expecting my drink still. He came back with the drink but forgot the dish for my honey.  I don't think I have ever been to any other pizza joint that one can't select a different crust. It's just bread, I'm the customer and I don't want a lot of it. The customer is always right and I am pretty sure I am not the first to suggest having some options when it comes to the amount of bread you have with your pizza. So here we go - with the only option - deep dish - as I moved a slice into my plate I noticed the oil and grease dripping all over...sick. I love cheesy, maybe even a little greasy but this thing was saturated in it. I felt my stomach cringe after the first slice so I boxed the rest and tried some of my honey's meatloaf open face sandwich. It was OK, just a little too salty for me and definitely overcooked (maybe from sitting too long under the heat lamps). Over all this place sucks and we will never waste out money here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=760
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2742,19397,3.0,7/1/2009,"We went here before a movie at the AMC Del Amo (Public Enemies, which wasn't that good).  I'm not a big fan of the food here (but if you are a fan of places like T.G.I. Friday's or Applebee's, this should be a welcomed change). The service at BJ's was very good.  We shared one of their deep dish pizzas (which was kind of like a Pizza Hut ""pan"" pizza with lots of toppings).  A medium easily serves three.  They had accidentially dropped the pizza, so the manager came by and said there would be an additional wait.  They comped the pizza, and they even offered soup to hold us over. One waiter had to leave, and another came on, and the transition was smooth.  Finally (though we didn't pay for the pizza), $20 for a pizza at a sit-down place that easily fills three isn't that bad.  So if you are a fan of chain sports bar places, BJ's may be worth a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=760

I had the exact same sourdough bacon cheeseburger with potato wedges, and they were like night and day.

The next visit she decided to go with a grilled chicken sandwich -- which had to be taken back because the chicken was charred.

Brittany R.,"San Pedro, CA",1,1,,2.0,12/14/2011,"I recently ate at this location this past week with my mother and 3 year-old daughter. It was only about 1 pm in the afternoon. Slightly busy. The food is very delicious and great but I'm afraid I cannot say the same for the service! The host sat us down in one of the rows of booths. It took our server about ten minutes to just come and take our drink orders! Once we got our beverages my mother ordered the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. I ordered a giant suffed baked potato with a small salad and chicken strips for my daughter.       The first order that came was my baked potato (that came with a small side of mixed butter, sour cream and barely any chives). Then the chicken strips and lastly my mother's soup and salad along with my salad! Even our waitress was shocked the potato came before the chicken strips or the salad and soup. Our waitress was really nice but seemed very busy waiting on what seemed the entire row of booths we were in. She didn't even ask my mother if she wanted more of the unlimited soup or salad.      I feel the restaurant needs more structure for the waiters/waitresses. The servers should know what tables they are in charge of. If they do know it really doesn't show.  It just seems that whatever order comes out on the kitchen counter, any server who notices it just takes it out to the table if they're waiting on it or not. I understand that the staff are probably just looking out for each other so no customers get cold food but it looked very chaotic and needs some more order! In my opinion.

I never thought I'd ever describe any form of beer delicious, but BJ's brewed beer was nice and sweet.   However, when I went here for my birthday dinner, the service was BIZARRE. I made reservations at least 2 weeks in advance to make sure I get it on the day of my birthday at the time that I wanted and... SUCCESS! The lady on the phone was even uber nice to offer me the balcony/patio because I had reserved for a party of 20, which she called a 'big party.' When the day finally arrived, I confidently walked infront of the people waiting in line and checked in with the hostess thinking I was going to get seated right away because I had a reservation.  BUT NO. I had to WAIT at least 45 minutes to get seated, and I didn't even get an outdoor table as promised.  After putting together a row of tables for us (clearly showing how unprepared they were), they finally seated 14 of my guests plus myself (15 people).  I thought the night was going to go smoothly from there. But when the rest of my guests arrived, (4 more people, 1 cancelled on me) I was told those 4 had to sit seperately because they couldn't make the customers they had JUST SEATED at the end of my row, whom they put there AFTER they seated us KNOWING I reserved for a party of TWENTY, move somewhere else. Not only that, but they even had teh audacity to tell my 4 guests that they had to wait BEHIND the customers who walked in before them. I complained, as anyone would, but everyone working there played victim with me. My last 4 guests just decided to eat at RA sushi instead and just met up with me after. Our server took too long to give us our food, our check, and everything else we had asked for. The worst part  was I was left worrying about whether my guests were enjoying themselves or were being just as frustrated and annoyed as I was. BJ's in Torrance, you have embarassed me to the max I want to cut them some slack as that night must have just been a very busy one, but you don't do that to someone's birthday or to someone who's made a reservation.

Came here with school friends to celebrate 2 birthdays. Initially, the head count was 14, but as the night progressed, more unannounced guests showed up. We eventually hit 23 people. The staff were kind and courteous and very accommodating. No attitudes were given like you usually would get at a restaurant when hosting a party of that size. Drinks and food came out in a timely manner (or as quick as they could get all of our orders out). The majority of the food ordered was pizza because many people in the group had never dined at BJ's.

Albert L.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,186,142,3.0,1/8/2011,"I've been to BJs six times or so throughout my life now, including twice over this break.  First time was in Cerritos, then Westwood, then four times here in Torrance.  It was only recently that my mother mentioned about a ""happy hour"" at BJs.  Because I've been at college in other cities on the opposite coast, I know very little about the ""happy hour"" scene of los angeles, let alone a particular suburb of LA. I have to say, they're extremely conservative in offering happy hour specials. I've never heard of a single place (of the few that i know about) that offer less than 2 dollars off anything.  given that a happy hour is usually centralized around drinks, and BJ's brews their own beer, i expected to see a bit more of a discount on drinks. half off mini pizzas was the only half decent deal, although the mini pizza is really quite mini.   my friend and i got the chicken pesto flatbread pizza, and it was nothing particularly special.  given the nature of this restaurant though, i didn't expect spectacular food anyways.  i opted to have one of their cider/beer mixes (some berry cider with their piranha pale ale), which actually tasted pretty sweet and nice. this is another ""cheesecake factory"" alternative, meaning that it's good for groups and offers a good variety of food options. they got good beer; i'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=640

We went there bc my sis insisted their pizzas are such and such... We ordered a medium size pizza half chicken, half veggie and we absolutely no onions on them, with whole wheat. The pizza arrived at our table loaded with i onions and the crest was such a disaster. It was soggy and out of shape and all over the place... I wish I took a pix to post here... We asked for a second pizza with regular crust and NO onions. It arrived practically without a topping on the veggie side!!!! And I mean it! There were 2 or 3 olives on it but they were CANNED olives... And I swear to my everything that pizza didn't cost them more than 30 cents.... I wish there was a no star choice here so I could use it.

Try to get a taste for good food and distinguish btw crap and food... Stay away from this place and live healthy. Go try pizza slices at whole foods store and see the difference.

People that sat down after we ordered got food before us. 30 min to get food and 15 min to get the check. Granted. this was New Years but I went at 3 or so and there were a bunch of tables empty so the ""It must be busy"" excuse can't be justified. I ordered the Angus Sliders and they felt like they came out of a box. The meat was well past well-done and the surface entirely charred. Not charred as in grill marks charred but both sides of the patty. The bun looked roughly handled as it was wrinkled. This may not seem like a big deal but the presentation is an important part of the meal. I'm not sure why but every single time I've been to a BJ's, the server always changes halfway through my meal. What, do they have one hour long shifts or something? And if customers are in the middle of a conversation, don't interrupt, even if you want to get off your shift. (The customer is always right!)

The buffalo wings appetizer is also amazing.  They give you a lot of wings, which are borderline too meaty.  They are crispy on the outside and have spicy sauce and ranch drizzled on them.  The buffalo hot sauce and ranch come on the side so you can dip them as much as you want. The pizza is good.  Not  a true deep dish, like an authentic Chicago Deep dish which is stuffed full of meat and vegetables.  It's more like a  thick pan pizza, but still pretty good.

There were 3 employees standing there and saw that we entered. We were the only ones there waiting to be seated. But no employee acknowledged us nor told us where to stand to wait to be seated.  We wait patiently to be acknowledged and seated but then another party walks in through the other side of the lobby entrance. They get acknowledged and then escorted ahead of us to their table. So we walk over to that side. After standing there for a while, other people came in after us and were greeted promptly.  Since we were still waiting, we just walked out. Our recommendation is BJ needs to retrain its employees to treat each customer with respect, not play games and ignore them. So speak with your wallet and take your hard earned dollars elsewhere.

After the second time of her asking us if we wanted dessert she came back and put the bill on the table and didnt say anything, not a thank you or have a great day, nothing. Being rushed by her, clearly she didnt want to be there and we were keeping her from leaving, its not like it was late and they were closing, it was like 6pm. as we were leaving I saw another server, clearly off his shift walking around the restaurant with his shirt sloppily hanging out, his earphones in and wearing his apron around his neck like a cape. very unprofessional and not a great experience at this place, then again, its just BJ's, i should lower my expectations when visiting a place like that again.... that is if i go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=860

Our original server was a bug! She kept coming to the table literally every minute before we even knew what we wanted. Then after we put our order in they switched servers on us. It took them over an hour just to bring my appetizer and it was the wrong one. Literally every customer that came after us received their food before us. They brought our entrees about 5 minutes afterwards. The toppings on my pizza were wrong and the bread on my friends sandwiches was had as a rock. When they finally got my appetizer of boneless wings right they were smaller than a McDonalds chicken nugget! I had completely lost my appetite & just wanted to leave. They knocked off my appetizer, half off our entrees, and gave us free desserts but I was far from pleased. They were still taking forever just to even bring the check.

Untensils that was given to us was only for four and not six so we had to ask for that not to mention plates too they only had four, c'mon simple common sense... And then there's the drinks, our server is so confident he'll remember our order that he doesn't even write anything down. We asked for ice teas some water with lemon wedges and all we got was sprite and plain water without lemons. My mom was also treated offensively, we were ordering our appetizers and my mom wanted the lettuce wrap and the server said that it was her main meal. I mean seriously? Don't you know the definition of appetizers? So the best part was when all of our order came in and they have no room to put it in because they put us in a pretty shitty table seating and space and that is why they had to move us when we complained the best part was when the server asked us if we want help to move our food, lol seriously these people are so idiotic and offensive.

Josh A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,48,,4.0,6/18/2013,"I love BJ's and its rowdy yet appropriate atmosphere for this particular chain. The food is good, the service friendly and attentive most of the time. Their pizookies are somewhat overrated, and not as large as I'd like them to be but come in a variety of flavors and are a fine way to polish off a meal. Not recommended for people who fancy a quiet, soothing atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=840
Jennifer Lynn A.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",60,12,23,1.0,12/18/2012,"Worst service ever!! Went there for lunch with a friend, my beer was beyond flat--so disgusting. The waitress took forever to come take our order and then the food took twice as long to arrive and when it did, it was awful. The pizza was just as bad as pizza hut, so greasy. My friend and I tried to split our bill and instead of charging my card for $16, the waitress charged my card for $6! Huh??? Anyhow, I let that slide....the worst of all of this is when I randomly checked my bank account the next day and found that they charged my card for the $6 I got a receipt for but apparently they also charged my card $60, our bill in total was only $29!! I called the restaurant to find out what was going on and the manager said the waitress charged my card for the wrong amount and immediately voided it. Either way my bank account was shorted $60 for three days! And the manager was so rude about the whole situation, and I was most upset about the fact that no one had has the decency to tell me that my card was overcharged! I worked in the food/customer service industry as well, I understand accidents happen--but at least have the nerve to tell me what occurred so that I understand and not freak out that I have a very large charge on my account that I did not make. The manager didn't even offer me a gift card or free dessert or anything to appease me and smooth things over. Very bad customer service and mediocre food.

Kristen C.,"Waipahu, HI",77,630,197,3.0,7/31/2009,"After a day of seeing LA and shopping, we decided to try BJ's because I really wanted to try some deep dish pizza.  During dinner hours the place was pretty full but we only had to wait 10 mins for a table so it wasnt too bad.  First off our waiter was very slow and didnt really pay any attention to us, even as she walked by she didnt even check on us so we had to stop other waiters for some help.   As for our food, we ordered the half white pizza and have bj's special or something like that.  The white pizza has a white alfredo like sauce with chicken and the bj's special is like a supreme at pizza hut.  We also ordered bruschetta and the avocado egg rolls for apps.  The bruschetta was good, the bread was nicely toasted and topped with the tomatoes...mmm.  Everyone else seemed to really like the egg rolls as it was just ok for me.  When the pizza came our waitress actually served us but she had a really hard time cutting it.  I tried the bj's special and it was ok, nothing special and It didnt even seem like a deep dish pizza that i've seen on tv because i didnt even have to use my knife and fork because the crust wasnt even that thick.  As for dessert a few of us shared the oreo pizookie with vanilla ice cream and it was so delicious and a perfect way to end an ok meal with crappy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=840

Kenneth D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",224,66,,4.0,9/27/2010,"What do you do after a mighty workout...Ruin it with food of course. My man Jon and I randomly worked out until the AM and wanted some grub so off we drive to go get sushi at RA (we figured we might convince them to give us some) but alas the sushi was put away. So we go to BJs and it is crowded. It being a friday night and all, we tried to find a seat at the bar but could not so we tried moving chairs until finally the gods opened up two seats. In comes our bartendress Coraline who basically had the cordial manner and laughed at our inane jokes and made us feel welcome. Kinda bartendress a boy could fall in love with by the end of the night. Well...I get mini crushes all the time and I'm usually buzzed or drunk by the end of the night. I digress...The service was excellent. We got the 20 dollar special, I mean I had a tomato basil soup which was not too spicy and a good consistency. Next came the pizza I had the artichoke one and my friend had the other half as a BJs special, the artichoke one was good but very creamy and heavy with a lot of cheese. The artichokes and veggies are flavorful and I loved the crust. Not the best gourmet pizza I've had and next time I would avoid the cream cheese and stick with the italian or veggie pizza. I had the snakebite, that is guiness with some pear cider and it was delicious. Layered goodness that blended perfectly and was sweet yet full bodied, next I had black velvet which was I think their porter with berry cider again sweet yet velvety taste that goes down smooth. I was buzzing it ok when the pizookie came. Pan baked gooey oatmeal raisin cookie and smooth vanilla ice cream melting together and as you taste them...an orgasm in your mouth. Hahaha ok not that epic but that night maybe the combination of workout, the bartendress, and the full moon made that pizookie a love affair of sweet creamy lust. So if you come here and only have a few bucks on you have a mixed beer and a pizookie. You won't regret it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=840

The ambiance and atmosphere really keeps the place with long wait lines because the pizookie is worth the wait!  Absolutely in love with the pizookies! Every single one has not failed to be surprisingly delightful. The coolness of the ice cream melts away as soon as it touches the large cookie, and the pieces one-by-one continue to pop that sweet sensation as they enter into your mouth. The edges of the cookie are usually baked just enough so that there forms a hard crust on the outside holding in the flavors from the soft cookie.

I understand it gets busy on the weekends, I expect that even because the food is good and the beer is fantastic (aside from the Pumpkin seasonal ale, which for some reason, tends to taste more like Jager than a good Pumpkin Ale) So after an hour, we checked in to see where we were on the list and were told it should only be another 10 minutes or so.  My friends and I are patient people, so we waited.  1 hr 45 minutes now, so we check in again as we were told the table would be ready in 10, they apologize and tell us just a few more minutes as they are cleaning the table. Well, for some reason, we kept waiting.  It's like a bad TV show, once you've invested your time into 3 seasons, you have to keep going until you see the trainwreck that is the end of the show in its entirety. After THREE hours and my complaint to the manager, we were seated.  Then, our waitress only came by once to take our order and completely forgot a few of our beers (mine included) until the end of our meal.  At that point, I said ""thank you, but we won't be paying for these"" and I asked to speak to the manager again.  Instead, they comped the beers, when they should have comped half the meal in my opinion.

The food itself is really nothing to write home about, everyone seems to go gaga over their pizzas, but I do not think that it's worth $14.25 for a small pizza, which is basically 4 slices.  It's the size of a personal pan pizza at Pizza Hut, which costs $10 less than BJs. The service, was to put into one word, horrendous.  Last time, we had a party of 6 and they jammed us into a booth, where my legs went numb from the position I had to sit in order for everyone to BARELY fit in.  Our server did not even come to our table until about 10 minutes later, where after taking our drink order vanished for another 20 minutes.  She finally came back with our drinks, took our orders and then proceeded to never be seen again.  Refills on drinks were something you could only dream of, and the food came out about an hour later after ordering, well almost all of it, because I NEVER got my food.  Yup, I ordered a small Buffalo Chicken Pizza and never received it.  Even after everybody had already finished eating.   At this point, the server decides to FINALLY ""check"" in with us and didn't even realize I never received my food until I gently ""reminded"" her about it.  I finally got my pizza to go, but I never wanted to order take-out pizza that would take 2 1/2 hours to get.  The saddest part of this review though, is that people are still going to go to this place and say it's WONDERFUL...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=740

Lewis E.,"Fresno, CA",162,4,9,1.0,5/7/2014,"After a long day of traveling my girlfriend and I were in search of some comfort food. We left the hotel and drove into Hermosa and Redondo. It was a Monday night and it was close to 10pm so everything was closed or closing. We headed towards the mall and noticed there were a few restaurants still open. I've never been to a Lazy Dog Cafe and after the way things ended up I wasn't in the mood to gamble the last decision of my day. Since I've been to Bj's many times in different cities I thought I'd win this bet. WRONG. Our server came to greet us, she seemed sweet and took our drink order. She asked if we wanted to start with an appetizer and I thought why not..Avocado Egg Rolls it is! When she brought the appetizer she didn't not bring any plates which made it hard to share so we used napkins. I asked for plates. Just as she dropped off the plates and walked away our entrees arrived. We had not more than a few bites of our appetizers and felt rushed. Oh well I was hoping to get back to the hotel sooner anyway. My girlfriend ordered the Lemon Chicken Pasta and I had another pasta dish that came with olive oil but requested to have cream sauce instead. BTW the person who dropped off the entrees was very short with us, she dropped the food and left. She didn't not ask if we needed anything or if everything looked ok. She must have been a runner/expo I hope not a manager. On to the food. My pasta was angel hair so its easy to overcook, its was mushy and dry. The blackened chicken was dry and tasted like it was made at the beginning of dinner service. My girlfriends entree was the same mushy, pastey and had an overwhelming lemon taste. Our drinks were not refilled throughout the meal and I finally had to ask after positioning my glass at the end of the table. Meanwhile there where 2 bussers at the table next to ours watching soccer while pretending to bus it for 10 minutes. Although our server was nice she didn't seem to be fully engaged in taking care of us. This is probably due to the time of night and Im sure she was juggling side work and trying to squeeze in her tables in between. We presented a credit card as our form of payment but I did hear her ask the table next to us if they needed change. To me that is another sign of rushing or inexperience to assume all of the cash in the guest check holder was hers for the taking. My rating was based on this experience NOT the chain of restaurants.

One of the reasons is because their kitchen closes around 12am, which is great for us because we work late and we got no time to cook at home. Plus their food is good. I love their minestrone soup. (too bad they dont have a bigger size.) After having a bad treatment from the same waitress 3 times in a row we stopped coming here. We stayed a really LONG time without passing by the door.  We decided to give it a second chance.  I missed the food so much that only this week we've been there for 5 times to have dinner and 1 time to have lunch... only in one week. The waiter even know us now. Im totally addictive to their Brownie... is the best thing EVER. Tonight we went there AGAIN around 11pm .... the hostess is the same almost every night we went. She saw when i was coming in, she looked at me and turned her back and started cleaning the balcony while i was standing there for almost 5 min. and her coworkers would just get there and talk to her, when finally someone asked how many? How can that be possible? Never had the old waitress again which is good, now the hostess??? Specially the hostess because she is the one that welcome the costumer...  maybe she was just having a bad day... who knows?!

Coral L.,"Torrance, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/27/2009,"I love BJs Brewhouse, the restaurant chain. The Del Amo location, not so much. My boyfriend and I used to drive to Cerritos regularly just to get our deep dish pizza fix at the BJs by Cerritos mall, so we were absolutely thrilled when we found out that a BJs was coming to Torrance. However, ever since it opened, we have never had a single great experience there. Why? The service SUCKS.  Eating dinner there usually turns into a 3 to 4 hour, extremely painful ordeal. Not only is the wait long (which is to be expected at any BJs), but unlike other locations, once you get to your table, the waiting isn't over. Oh no, not even close. Getting someone to even take your drink order is like pulling teeth. Once it took us at least 30-40 minutes just to get our check! When we asked to speak to a manager during one visit, it took half an hour for one to even show up at our table! I guess he must have been busy apologizing to every other table in the joint. The only reason I'm not giving this place one star is because of the food. BJs has some of the best pizza I've ever tasted... the BJs Favorite or Spinach and Artichoke pizzas are deeelicious. The Avocado Egg Rolls and Chocolate Chip Pizookie desserts are always a must have. I used to go to the BJs in Cerritos very frequently, but now after so many bad experiences at the Del Amo location, I rarely if ever find myself wanting to go anymore. The Del Amo location is way too small and understaffed to meet the demand.

The seating at the bar does fill up fast, but there are always people getting up so you shouldn't have to wait long.  The big t.v. is also a plus when sitting at the bar you can watch like 5 sporting events on it.  The micro brews are great and I recommend the Tataonka( its like a beer milkshake).  B.J'S doesn't kill your wallet and lets you have a good time whether your waiting for a movie or just getting out from one as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=880

Waited 1.5 hours to be seated, I expected it being a Sunday, big group, and a holiday.  2. Had to re-order my kids drinks 3 times, because they were always on there way after 15 min and everyone got there drink...(apple juice and chocolate milk....BTW). 3. They take my wife's menu without taking her order, waiter takes order, comes by 2 minutes later and ask her did she order something! 4. Waited 40 min to get 2 appetizer platters, and  another 30 minutes to get our food (by this time my kids our starving). 5. Food comes piece mail, 2 or 3 items at a time - med pizzas, when we order large (was told they ran out of pans - no problem - only to see the table next to us get a large pizza 1 min later - who sat down 20 min after us). 6. 10 minutes later my daughters food comes out COLD, and they forget my sons kid pizza ....  7. 10 minutes later pizza comes out by manager,and we ask for my wife's burger - tells me it wasn't on the order???? to top it off my son, says I'm not hungry anymore it took to long . 8. Burger comes out 5 min later 9. Needed to flag down other waiters to get refills after talk with manager? 10. We try to order desert, waiter brings menu, said take your time I'm here until 11:30 - its 9pm (this guys is complaining about turn over after all this)?    11. As we try to leave we have to ask for ""to-go"" boxes 4 times! 12. 4 items comp'd (thank you), but see a 17% service charge for group size? Look I worked in the food industry through out my young life... runner, waiter, bust-boy, & bartender....

Clint U.,"Washington, DC",67,278,142,2.0,7/21/2008,"The name says it all:  Brewhouse first.  Restaurant second. The menu says:  BJ's FAMOUS DEEP DISH PIZZAS.   Famous for what?   I guess it's not misadvertisement.  We ordered 3 large pizzas and one small.   Two BJ's favorite, one Vegetarian, and a small cheese.   Thats $85 of pizzas.    It's obvious that BJ's caters to people that never had real deep dish pizzas.   So what's wrong here? 1.  A $5 Dominoes pizza has the same amount of toppings as a large BJ's pizza.   The toppings were extremely skimpy and thin.   You can see many areas of bare crust through the toppings....what a ripoff for their ""works""  and vegetarian pizzas. 2.  There is nothing deep dish about this pizza.   The pizza is thick because it is all bread.   I've been to deep dish pizzas where the ingredients weighs down the pizza with hefty amounts of ingredients.   There wasn't much of a crunch or crispiness to the crust.   Yes it was take out, but the crust on the bottom wasn't browned and came out more like bread.  If i wanted a loaf of  bread I would have gone to a bakery.  3.  Taste of the sauce was  bland.   Not spicy, just plain.   There were also chucks of tomatoes but they were also not seasoned.    4.  The wait on a Sunday night was 1.5 hours at 7 pm.  Way too long for mediocre pizza.   We couldn't wait with 6 hungry kids so we ordered take out. OVERALL:   If you want to get drunk with beer and don't really care about the quality of food, this could be a place to go to.   The atmosphere is like the many breweries/restaurants that have been around for the last 20 years.   What makes this place different is that they have 20 foot ceilings.

Upon walking in, the gentleman at the hosting station greeted us by saying, ""hi, party of 2? Please step aside as they are clearing your table."" He seemed friendly enough, however three more groups of people proceeded to walk in behind us. He greeted all with the same generic greeting ""hi, party of 3? Step aside....party of 2, step aside..... Etc"" Never once got a name, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought he must have a good memory. Well, as the other hostess came up with an open table he proceeded to seat 2 other groups both party of 2s, that came in after us. Then looked at us and said, ""Oh , they are still cleaning your table"". Needless to say, it's a small thing to do, just greet and take a name so you don't lose track of who came in what order, but he failed to do this. Customers are loyal by the little gestures and respect, not the by the apologies afterward. Which never came.

He's not the type to send food back, but he did this time.  Of course by the time he got his meal back, we where all done eating.  And his pork chop was way over cooked (hey BJs, cold and undercooked are not the same thing).  I waitress was nice, but the service was about average.  Thank goodness we didn't have another waitress we enjoyed watching - she spent a large amount of her time flirting with a couple guys at a nearby table.

The second time I came here was the worst because the waitress literally had a look on her face like she hated us and we were annoying. She had an attitude right from the start. Maybe it was because we were a table full of women and she was upset she could not flirt with us for a bigger tip - who knows. The ham sandwich and ceasar salad I had during this trip however was very delicious. The last time I went my date wanted to buy us a brownie to share for a sweet treat. The waitress seemed irritated when we said we would like one brownie to share. This was after she asked us if we wanted appetizers, mojitos, or beer. Some other woman ended up bringing us our brownie - and surprise! she had an unhappy look on her face. Is anybody happy working there?! Well the brownie sucked and the waitress sucked too.

I felt awful and gave her a extra 20, at that point she looked confussed and I let her know what I had over heard.  I think I may have over stepped my bounds. She simply thanked me retured the 20 and went on her way.  I left the money and hope she took it.

Everyone else had beer and my cousin had a lemon drop. We shared some appetizers (mini pizzas, pot stickers, and stuffed mushrooms) which were all really good and hit the spot. I ordered the California burger and was blown away. I am a sucker for chipotle and it had a nice spicy chipotle mayo and an extra kick with green chilies. I would definitely order it again. My boyfriend ordered a calzone with jalapenos and anchovies (ew) but they accidentally made one with artichokes and jalapenos. They probably couldn't believe someone was actually ordering anchovies.

He lost our order on the way to the kitchen, brought too many soups, forgot our drinks, and put my baby in harms way. Who in the right mind plants a hot coffee right in front of a baby sitting in the high chair? Also, anything hot like the soups, he would hover it over her head.  We had to ask other servers not handling our tables to get our drinks. We repeatedly asked our server for the drinks, but would forget in a span of 3 minutes.  The Food - Honestly, not impressed. I ordered the Honey Crips Chicken Salad. The salad is DRENCHED in some kind of dressing (ranch), and the strips of chicken, well, there were 4 skinny ones, that was worse than Jack in the Box's chicken strips. Not worth the 11 dollars....

Noel A.,"Torrance, CA",137,90,13,2.0,6/13/2009,"This place is still terrible. We had a late lunch here a couple of weeks ago. Our last experience was during dinner last September - figured lunch would be better but it wasn't.   There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, so we thought the service would be better.  We knew something was wrong as soon as we sat down because the manager was talking to the couple across from us. They looked pretty upset. The waiter came by to take our order and he did not write down what we ordered. My wife who was 20 weeks pregnant at the time asked for a California Grilled Chicken Sandwich and a glass of water and I wanted a mini Sweet Pig Pizza with ice tea. He mumbled our order back to us and then proceeded to take the order of the table next to us. He came back several times confirming what we ordered and saying the food should be out shortly.  It took about 10-15 minutes before he realized we didn't have our drinks yet. When we brought us our drinks, he reassured us our food would arrive momentarily but it seemed like forever. Anyway, another person brought out my pizza - it was a ""small"" ham and cheese pizza and not a mini Sweet Pig. The waiter came and realized that wasn't what I ordered so he said it would be free. As soon as I started to eat it, my ""mini"" Sweet Pig came. Again the waiter came back and said there was a mix up so I got the first pizza for free and was charged for the one I ordered. Then my wife's order came - it was a Grilled Chicken Club and not a California Grilled Chicken Sandwich. My pregnant wife was so hungry she just ate it. The manager came by shortly thereafter to apologize for the pizza when we broke the news to him that my wife's sandwich was also not what she ordered. The manager gave us that for free as well. When the check came out, it still showed the charge for the sandwich so we complained to the waiter and told him to talk to his manager who didn't tell him we got the free sandwich.  He seemed confused but he approached him only to come back and apologize as he didn't know about her free meal as well. It seems like the staff don't talk to one another. I am sure someone else got my wife's sandwich and/or didn't get their pizza I ate.  Good thing we had a gift card to pay for our meal on top of the free food we received.  Not planning to eat at that location any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=900

Lisa I.,"Torrance, CA",91,100,23,3.0,8/27/2008,"i realize that this BJ's opened relatively recently and they are probably still working out the kinks, but the service i had here this weekend was pretty awful (although they did somewhat make up for it).   i came here on sunday for a late lunch with a friend, but service was so slow, it ended up being an early dinner as well.  i don't know who was at fault for the long wait (kitchen was slow, wait staff was spread pretty thin, etc.), but i've never had such poor service at any BJ's location before.  the place was sort of busy, but not as crowded as i've seen it (not to mention that i've had far faster/better service when it was more crowded).  after taking over 10 minutes to get water, we placed our food order only to wait another 35+ minutes just to receive the appetizer.  we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip with focaccia bread instead of chips (the ONLY way i will eat this!) which was good, as usual.   because i ordered a mini pizza, i expected a bit of a wait (my friend ordered the california grilled chicken sandwich).  but when the appetizer came so late, we joked that the rest of our food would probably arrive around the same time.  but well after we finished our appetizer, we STILL had not received our meals.  in fact, people at the table next to us noticed we were waiting a long time and remarked how slow service was.  after being seated for almost an hour and a half, our food FINALLY arrived.  the manager personally delivered our food, apologized for the long wait, and comped our entire meal (offering to add a pizookie).  this was an appreciated gesture, especially since we hadn't made any direct complaint.  so our waitress or the manager (or both) themselves noticed the poor service we received.  however, my pizza was cold -- not what i expected after waiting so long.  i was so hungry at that point, i didn't even consider sending it back.  when we finished eating, our waitress asked if we wanted to order a pizookie, but by then we'd been there nearly 2 hours.  not wanting to test out how long it would take for a pizookie to arrive (as much as we LOVE pizookies!), we decided against it. i don't blame our waitress for our poor service, but i would have liked it if she were more proactive in checking on our order after we were waiting without food for so long.  the manager did slightly make up for the wait by comping our meal, but with my food arriving cold, i still wanted to give 2 stars.  i only gave them 3 stars because the other two times i've been here, the service was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=900
Nancy I.,"Irvine, CA",5,140,7,4.0,1/26/2009,"I went to the one is Cerritos before and wasn't too impress with the food or service, but tried out the Happy Hour here and the drinks and appetizers were pretty good! I never sat down for the food service so I can't speak for that but the service at the bar was pretty good even on busy nights so I love going here for Happy Hour!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=900
Kei C.,"Carson, CA",0,7,,2.0,5/15/2011,"BJs in Torrance Ca. service sucked sooo bad tonight, that I came home, pulled out my laptop to make sure I wrote this review before I went to sleep tonight. We had a party of 8, the greeter said the wait would be 30 minutes, instead it was 2HOURS. When inquiring about the wait the ""greeter"" said ""oh, we are waiting for these people to finish eating."" Was she serious? They kept bringing the food and desserts...WITH NO PLATES. So again we had to wait.. Our waiter was really nice, only because I think he felt bad for our experience. The people that bring your food had the worst attitudes. Maybe it was a full moon tonight......By the way Ladies, be careful if you wear heels the floors are soooo slippery. My cousin fell by the bar coming out of the restroom and she said all the employees just looked at her and didn't even bother to see if she was ok, or even help her for that matter. My whole family was disgusted by this experience. It SUCKED!!!!!! Food is good, cant complain about that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=900
lia s.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,,2.0,1/11/2012,"so after numerous times going here I finaly had to write a review. last night i went in for a late nite, dinner, just me and the hubby as this is is fave place. now we have been here before and they have messed up our order and mischarged us before, but it ususaly got taken care of. but yesterday was too much, we sat down and the waitress was like so are you ready to order? hum no can you give us a min? but the whole time i felt we were rushed to put in our order. it was 2 hours to closing! so i didn't think we were holding her up. after we palced our order, i had to ask 3 diffrent people for a straw, where they all went to diffrent tables waited on them, and like ( not exagerating) 15 minutes later, we had a straw handed to us.  the food was ok, but not as great as it normaly is, when it arrived.  again they mischarged us, normaly the staff are nice, and very busy, but this time, like i said the wiatress rushed us, then forgot about us, then mischagred us. so i'm not sure about going here again.  after the 4th time of messing up our order i think im done with this place. darn now i will have to find a new fave brewery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=900
A P.,"Cypress, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/12/2008,I've been over to this BJ's a few times since it opened and I've really thought they've done a good job. The atmosphere is great and the food is just as good as Cerritos or HB. I've had really nice servers and I didn't feel that the time I waited for my food was too long. The place did just open and I doubt they had much cross-over of waitstaff from other BJ's because of distance. Every time I've gone a manager has checked on my table (something I rarely see at other locations!) and the one time the dressing was wrong my salad he quickly fixed it and comped it! I am really happy with my experiences there and I will keep going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=900
Jean J.,"Carson, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/14/2009,"Now, i am very understandable if small mishaps occur in the restaurant because it happens. I've also been a big fan of BJ's pizookies. However, my experience today was rather unbecoming. One of my utensils had a piece of lettuce stuck on it. And the utensil of someone from our party had residue on hers. We let that slide. We didnt call them out on it because we figured they were busy and accidents can happen. We had ordered a pizookie trio. It was delicious but our night was ruined when we found a bobby pin in one of our pizookies! YES! We alerted the waiter, and of course the manager comes to our table. He apologizes and says he has no idea how the bobby pin got in there. Then he has the nerve to imply that one of us might have purposely put the pin in there because he said that ""they were investigating how the bobby pin got there, but nobody who works there wears bobby pins. so...we dont know how it got there."" Oh really? in the 10 seconds you ""investigated""? and you know exactly what ur employees wear in their hair? Now, i know one thing and that is the customer is always right. Dont try to imply stuff like that when you did something wrong. I was ready to forgive the incident if they hadnt implied that we were trying to scam them. I called them out on it. We didnt pay for the pizookie. Nevertheless, considering all i have seen tonight i have reached the conclusion that if you value your health and want to avoid food poisoning at all costs. Refrain from coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=900
Ru G.,"Mountain View, CA",15,165,8,1.0,9/4/2008,oh yeah...and my speedy almost got drenched by another server! all i needed was a dessert tray to fall on my head to cap off this afternoon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-torrance?start=900
