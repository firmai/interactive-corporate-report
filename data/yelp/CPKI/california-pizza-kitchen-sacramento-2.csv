Tom S.,"Sacramento, CA",5,52,,1.0,9/12/2009,"Up front I'll tell you that one could get better food buying microwaveable items at the grocery store.  CPK is a mediocre chain restaurant in an area where there are many local eateries with outstanding food,  That said, here is my experience..... We went to CPK for dinner,  4 adults, a few weeks after it opened.   The table shared an appetizer of ""Tuscan Hummus"" which had mediocre flavor and was too spicy hot to be enjoyable.   Our food took a while to get to the table even though the restaurant was virtually empty.  My spaghetti was so undercooked I sent it back and declined a replacement as I did not want to be eating after the rest of the table finished.  The server said something about the cooks still learning how to cook the various menu items and the spaghetti was not something they knew how to cook.  YIKES!!   Interestingly the food server did not ask how any of the other food was.  To me this is a huge red flag that they server knows the food is not good.   The Original Chopped salad was acceptable, but very unimaginative overall.   The portion size was on the small side.   The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza was - a chicken pizza with BBQ flavoring.  The BBQ flavor was overpowering.  Way too much for my tastes.  The crust was flavorless soda cracker.   Wow!  Better pizza can be had at Pizza Hut or Roundtable.    The Pesto Cream Penne was good, we maybe more ""ok.""  Nothing great, but at least it was cooked.   Food = 1 star.  Service = 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20

O M G.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1724,8473,3.0,10/6/2009,"Wow. The transformation from a Goodyear dump to this CPK is lovely. Glass walls. They offer bike delivery, curbside pick-up.. I went in and the ladies working there were overly nice. They had new items on the menu and I tried one-- The Moroccan salad.. It was awful. But if you've been to any CPK, you can expect the same. This one's nice and new, clean and pretty. Great location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20
Catrina L.,"Medina, NY",71,22,16,4.0,12/6/2010,"This is definitely one of my favorite places.  I'm a vegetarian and there's a fairly suitable amount of vegetarian options but you can still convince your meat eater friends to eat there.  I love the roasted pepper and goat cheese pizza, it's mouth watering.  All of their soups are vegetarian so that's really nice.  Most places use beef or chicken broths in their soup.  They have good salads.  I prefer the downtown one to the arden location because the atmosphere is a little classier.. nicer decorations and less teenagers who are going there after seeing a move.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20
Adam G.,"West Sacramento, CA",3,81,,2.0,7/3/2011,"Went here for lunch today. Not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I usually like the pizza here just fine and know what to expect.  The place we originally intended on going to was closed and CPK was close-by. They were not very busy and we were seated right away. I see a lot of other reviews mention bad service. We were greeted with a welcome from the host and our waitress was nice and helpful. We ordered 2 pizzas and the food was just average. Not bad, but not as good as I've had at other CPK's in the past (and that's not saying a lot really). I ordered the $9.50 ""Ultimate Margarita"" and it was horrible. It was like they didn't bother to mix/shake it and somehow it was warm (even with ice cubes in it). I mentioned it to our waitress and she took it back to fix it, but it didn't help much. So, there's $10 down the drain. From now on the only time I will be having CPK is at the airport when theres no Wolfgang Puck's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20
Stuck N.,"Lodi, CA",0,14,,3.0,5/10/2010,"Every month my hubby and son go to 2nd Saturday in mid-town, and have dinner at CPK as part of their ritual.  This Saturday, Mother's Day Eve, I decided to join them.  I hadn't been to CPK in several years, never to this restaurant. I loved the ambiance immediately.  We were seated at the window--huge floor to ceiling plate glass spanning the entire outside perimeter of the restaurant.  AND on 2nd Saturday, there's a lot of activity on the street to observe! We ordered two of the ""small plates"":   1) deep-fried artichoke hearts ($3.99) was a little misleading.  It appears to have been ONE artichoke heart cut into sixths, and deep-fried.  At that price, would have been nice to have the rest of the artichoke and a little aioli!!   It tasted good, but a bit pricey for what we were served!   2) Mediterranean plate ($4.29) included a spoonful of hummus, about 8 crumbles of feta cheese laced with olive oil, and an ice-cream scoop of diced, fresh veggies - cucumber, onion, tomatoe, etc-marinated in a tasty vinaigrette.  My complaint:  There were only 4 small bread wedges to scoop up all that deliciousness!!  To my dismay, I was spooning up the last bits of the salad when our waiter brought over some french bread!  That would have been nice to have about 5 minutes earlier.  Now I know. These dishes were good, but VERY meager for the price. The Santa Fe pizza was good, but not piping hot when we were served.   Overall, the food was good, but not that satisfying.  We were all still hungry when we left.  The ambiance was enjoyable.  Service was a bit lacking.  Ordered a water that I never got, but it was a busy night.   Next time I go, I'm gonna try a pasta dish.  Those plates looked filling!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20
Stephanie M.,"West Sacramento, CA",2,21,1,1.0,3/11/2010,"This is another one of those overrated restaurants. We get food from here often from the drug reps for our office and the pizza slices are so tiny but you can't get more than like two because the boxes are also tiny and you will have eaten half the box. Seriously, I can probably eat a whole box myself. lol It is very dry with hardly any taste. Their pasta has absolutely no taste at all! We had to pour on the salt and pepper and it was still gross and left a dry feeling on the roof of my mouth. Yuck. I prefer Little Cesar's over this place. It is nothing to write home about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20
Tanisha B.,"Sacramento, CA",269,173,66,3.0,1/10/2010,"They have a decent variety of things aside from pizza. I had the CPK Cobb salad, without beets, with ranch. The service was good. It's not a bad place to grab a bite and take a break from all the shopping.

David H.,"Folsom, CA",44,53,,3.0,1/13/2010,"Same as any CPK I've been too.  The food is fine, though a little overpriced as at any CPK.  The beer selection is pretty small.  Good location though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20

Matty K.,"Sacramento, CA",150,383,10,4.0,6/24/2009,"I work next door and have come here twice for lunch now.  I typically hate CPK, but only because I got food poisoning from the arden location once a really long time ago.  I decided, yes I should give it another shot.  The first time I had the grilled vegetable salad.  Yes.  Yes.  YES!  This has got to be one of the best salads I have EVER had.  It came with grilled Japanese eggplant, asparagus, and a variety of other vegetables that was warm and worked perfectly together.  The second time I got a pizza with brocollini, tomatoes, and somehting else on top.  It had a honey wheat crust.  Eh.  Honestly, I think their pizza kinda sucks.  But then again I think pizza from all over sucks.  Maybe I just don't like pizza.  That is why they get 4 stars.  Great salad, I just hate pizza.  Prices were reasonable, service was good, but a little slow.  They ARE brand new and the server looked like she had too many tables to deal with, so I'll cut them slack on the service side of things.  I'll be found lounging on the patio with employees until they really mess up that grilled vegetable salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20
Michelle I.,"Sacramento, CA",3,103,,2.0,3/12/2010,"It is what it is, a chain of mediocre food with mediocre service. Met 2 friends their last night (5 ish)... not very crowded at that time. We were promptly seated, drinks served and orders taken. The food arrived via 2 servers we had never seen. Okay, by that time my water glass was empty.... where did our waitress go??? Anyway, food was fine, i had the 1/2 grilled veggie salad with grilled shrimp, tasty and adequate. friends each had the BLT pizza. Hello, waitress??? I realize the place started to fill with whatever group of teenagers are in town for some band gig at the Convention Center... but... finally, i saw Ms. Waitress zoom by and caught her and asked if i could PLEASE get more water... she delivered.... okay, so were are done eating... sitting.... now where did she go... finally, she walked by again, totally ignoring us... grabbed her again, asked for the bill and my friends wanted boxes for leftovers. So, she brings the bill... no boxes... that took a 2nd trip..... if I don't go back here anytime soon,.... WAY too many better dining options in mid and downtown to put up that!@!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2?start=20
Justin C.,"Boston, MA",37,174,1,4.0,11/24/2010,"Price: 3.5/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 CPK rarely misses for me. This particular location isn't the best. I prefer the one on Arden. If you're unfamiliar, then this place features truly fun and creative pizzas.  I came here with a friend last week and shared the artichoke dip. I love artichoke dip and this one is probably near the best I've had. A bit pricey for what you get, but no big.  Here are my top 3 pizzas: 1. Peking Duck -  It's a little bit different and not for everyone, but I love it! I think it's seasonal though :( 2. BBQ Chicken - You simply can't go wrong here. 3. Thai Chicken - Only if you love Thai peanut sauce. It can get strong.    So I came in and the Peking Duck wasn't there. I got recommendations from the waitress. I told her what I liked and she suggest the Tostada. I was a bit hesitant, but she said I would like it and if I didn't she'll let me get something else in exchange. Awesome! Feeling adventurist, which you kind of have to be at this place, I got it and it was good. Not as good as the Peking or the BBQ, but I can see myself crave this later.  I will commend them on the service. It was a bit quiet and slower than the Arden location, so maybe it's why they're so prompt. I was drinking my water and I was almost in need of a refill. I turned around just to see if the our server is coming by. Immediately, she saw me turning around and walked over and asked if I wanted more water. Just from a glance she knew. Good stuff!! JUSTIN SAYS: It's a fun, creative place. I had yet to be disappointed in any of the pizzas I had there (I tried a bunch except anything with beef). AND, again, if you ordered something and don't like it, they'll make you different pizza. So be adventurist! The salads aren't the best. They're good, but just not a ""wow"" like some of their pizzas. Although I do like their Thai salad. Okay I like peanut sauce. Also, go to their website, put your email in and get a $5 coupon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2
Tiffany K.,"Sacramento, CA",812,1020,303,3.0,5/13/2010,"Like the airy, spacious feel of this downtown corner spot. Low booths, lots of glass and a small area for dining al fresco. What is not so thrilling is the food.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza ($12.99). It was on the menu as being ""famous"" in some regard, so I was expecting a pizza worthy of famous-ness.  Alas, it did not deliver for me. For starters, there was not much chicken on there. And there was not much pizza either! For the price, I had expected something a tad larger and/or more substantial. The crust was okay, nothing to get excited about - unlike One Speed's for instance.  Unless you're treating me, I don't think I'll be back; there are other spots to eat & conquer!

Super nice servers, fast, efficient.  Martinis - awesome Pizza - awesome Chocolate souffle - awesome Atmosphere - kinda stark. Weird that there are tv's in the dining room showing CNN while you eat dinner? Not sure about that.  Parking is on the street, but you should be able to find a close spot after 5pm.

Charles W.,"San Francisco, CA",27,124,3,1.0,4/4/2011,"1 star because i would give this place 1.5 and i bumped them up for my initial review. I don't know how well CPK is doing a a chain but im thinking probably not great, gimmicky overpriced pizza in a modern atmosphere is a great idea when the economy is booming, but when the economy is down that business model is not a smart one.  GF and i went for a late dinner around 8 and the place was pretty much empty i think 4 other tables were full and for a place the size of this it looks deserted.  Food: Meh and bleh are the 2 best ways to describe it, save the artichoke dip which is good but 10 dollars for a small bowl of the stuff is pretty pricey to me, Bandera has an artichoke dip much better and i think it may even be cheaper.  California club pizza: was Meh tasted like a blander version of a club sandwich, 13 dollars and the damn thing was tiny, really not a bad price for ""real"" pizza but this is pretty much the worst ""real"" pizza you can get.  Shit Tacos: they have the audacity to call them Korean bbq tacos i dont think they have a clue what korean bbq tastes like it was beyond sweet and wasn't even reminiscent of any asian flavors not even like panda express asian. GF literally took a bite and gave it to me. Also it was 5 dollars now i may sound like a cheapo but i don't mind paying top dollar when something is worth it, but 5 dollars for 2 of the smallest shittiest tacos i have ever had is ridiculous, its cheaper for 2 authentic good tacos from anywhere.   Server:  Nice attentive and apparently it was his first day but he ruined it when he stacked the last 3 slices of our pizza into a tiny box. ( i know i said the pizza was small but when the food sucks my appetite disappears)  This experience was so bad my gf who normally loves these places (Bj's, cheesecake factory, islands, upper scale chain places in general) FINALLY said to me CPK Never again.  In closing i hate CPK for the overpriced pretentious lazy gimmicky food that also happens to suck ass. Maybe CPK HQ will take a hint and do some QC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2
Monica M.,"Sacramento, CA",180,213,38,3.0,7/19/2010,"I met a friend here on a Tuesday night and we practically had the whole place to ourselves. We ordered the crispy artichoke hearts as an appetizer and the tostada pizza that my dining partner swore by. The artichoke hearts where lightly fried and served with a remoulade sauce which tasted like mayo with some spices.  I was kind of surprised on how few hearts where on the plate.  The tostada pizza had black beans, cheese, lettuce, tortilla strips, salsa and ranch dressing and I have to say that it was surprisingly good!

Jo W.,"Chicago, IL",88,549,14,3.0,10/18/2010,"I hate that I ate at a chain while in town, but I passed it while walking around my hotel area and it sounded good. If you've eaten at CPK, you know what the food tastes like and it tastes the same here. The service was just... odd. I wanted to place a carryout order to take back to my hotel, and the guy seemed to have a hard time understanding that I was going to place my order and come back for it. (I wanted to run over to CVS really quick.) I'm like, DUDE IT WILL BE OKAY. The CVS is a block away! But whatever. I came back, got my pizza, took it back to my hotel, and it was super tasty.

Karen S.,"Elk Grove, CA",12,17,,2.0,4/21/2010,"First of all let me say Happy Admin Day to all the hardworking support staff. Businesses wouldn't run without you! Meeting would happen, no one would be on time anywhere and I am pretty sure that the earth might stop for a minute if you all went on break at the same time. With that said, we took our staff here today for lunch. 2 hours later we finally went back to work...... We arrived with a party of 8 around 1130am with reservations thinking that we might be in and out in about an hour or just over but that wasn't the case. While the restaurant was busy it wasn't packed, service was still slow and we had to return one incorrect order.  While the food is good, seems like they are cutting back on some ingredients, one chicken salad sandwich had enough inside it to only cover half of the half of sandwich..... oh well.... he took the inside of the other half and made it a full serving.  This is the 2nd time in the last couple of months that I have tried this and it has been the same experience both times.... Don't think I am going to chance a 3rd.  They did however take an additional 20% off as they saw that we had been waiting for some time, but no one acknowledged it other than when the check was presented.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2
Jon M.,"Sacramento, CA",287,231,137,4.0,4/6/2010,"Our son's school recently held a fundraiser at this location so it was the perfect excuse to try this place out. All in all, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of CPK.  We arrived pre-dinner rush on a Thursday and were seated immediately. Our server, who paid closer attention to other larger tables near us, eventually took our drink and food orders: Cheeseburger Pizza (for the boy), Vegetarian with Japanese Eggplant (for us), a bowl of Tortilla Soup (a side for the wife), and a couple of their refreshing Strawberry Limeades.  The Cheeseburger Pizza tasted nearly identical to a Big Mac, up to and including the 'secret sauce'. The Tortilla Soup was cream-based; different than what we're used to but pretty good nonetheless. Think chili with cheese and Frito's and you'll have a good idea of what it tastes like. The hands down winner was the Vegetarian with Eggplant -- what an amazing pizza. All of the veggies were cooked to perfection, with a little bite to them, remaining bright and colorful. The sweet yellow corn, tangy tomato sauce and sundried tomatoes paired so well with the slightly-sweet Honeywheat crust. Man, we were talking about that pizza well on into the next day.  For that pizza alone, we've vowed to come back and try some of the others. And for $50 with tip, it was a pretty good deal. To be fair though, I might not have felt the same about the costs associated had 20% not gone to my son's school... but either way, good stuff for a good price. ATTN:  If anyone has tried the Jambalaya Pasta, please report back. I'm itching to try it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2
Justin N.,"San Francisco, CA",537,161,3,4.0,8/24/2010,"hmm how to rate this place is such a conundrum. Overall i think its a 3, but i'm going to give it a 4 for just sheer creativity. What this place lacks in WOW factor in its pizzas it makes up in variety and creativity. With flavors from all over the world like thailand, Jamaica, etc...its a unique place to go. However this will never be the best pizza in town, more like a unique west coast twist to the everyday pepperoni. The place is nice, big open windows lovely booths and service was great. A highly enjoyable place and great for friends. I've had the Sicilian, thai chicken, bbq chicken, jamaican jerk and i'm sure a couple others but the sicilian stand s out to be with its thin crust. but all are pretty good in their own right...maybe not a food orgasm, but a great and fun place to go",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2
Katherine H.,"Sacramento, CA",32,87,43,1.0,5/8/2011,"Let's make this review faster and more painless than the experience. My two nieces, sister and I were seated right away. As should be expected with less than 20 patrons in the restaurant.  It took no less than 15 minutes just for four drinks Why? Because our waitress was to busy servicing the needs of the table across from us. Which was in fact, all men. Why? More tip money I guess? Well she certainly did get more tip money from her flirting. Because after waiting 15 minutes for drinks, my sisters raviolis feeling like they were made with sand and her forgetting my order of Korean tacos (which I've read are horrible anyways, so blessing in disguise?). I left no tip at all. I've never done that. In addition to every time I tried to get her attention she was chit chatting it up with coworkers. If I'm paying $10 a plate for lukewarm mass generated food. Please to serve it to me in a nice and timely fashion. That's not to much to ask for you know? P.S. when you haven't given me silverware and I have neither fork nor napkin and am eating with hands. DON'T act like I asked for your firstborn child when I ask you for a napkin. Thanks.

It's not too thick and has lots of goodies in it. The Asparagus Soup is very good as well. These are must-tries in my eyes.  Secondly, I love their Asparagus and Spinach Spaghettini. It's a very simple and tasty pasta dish. It's filled with bite sized asparagus, spinach, and grape tomatoes and plenty of garlic. At first I thought I'd take some home since it was a pretty big dish, but I devoured the whole thing because it was just that yummy!

Anna L.,"Vacaville, CA",72,14,9,2.0,5/8/2011,"So...I ordered from their small appetite menu or whatever it's called. The mediterranean plate is what I chose...hummus, flat bread, some kinda cheese, olive cucumber salad.  Before I ordered, I asked the waitress if it's a good sized portion. She said it wasn't a lot and it's meant to be an appetizer for one person.  Weh-hell, when the server brought it out I immediately said, ""What the...it looks like I'm hungrier than what is on this plate. Can you send the waitress, please. Cuz I'll have to order more. Thanks."" There was literally 2 tablespoons of hummus, 1/4 cup of salad, 4 quarter inch cubes of cheese, and maybe half of a flatbread. Seriously? You can't even give  me a whole flatbread? Geez. A waste of $5. I can get the same amount of food free from costco. Ya know...free samples at costco. I ordered the korean steak tacos from the small bites menu to supplement my poorly portioned mediterranean plate. There were 2 tacos. And they were sorry excuses for tacos. They were the tiniest tacos I have ever seen.  Not worth the $6 that I paid. On the bright side... the service folk were attentive and friendly.

This new midtown location pretty much has the same vibe as the Arden location, just a tad bit busier with being new and all.  If you get there before 11:30 you should be able to plop yourself down at a table or a bar stool without the wait. Get there straight up at noon - good luck, you'll be in the waiting area watching me snarf down.  I don't know why I continue to try the pastas at this place. I really need to stop, smack my forehead and just go back to the Pear and Gorgonzola, or BBQ chicken pizza. The chicken tequila fettuccine is decent, but I'll be going back to that wonderful pear, Gorgonzola, hazelnut, caramelized onion pie of Yum.  The service was excellent; there were a ton of servers just twiddling their thumbs at 11:15 . . . then they got slammed. Even with that mad rush, our server still came over to our table frequently to clear away the butter clutter and whatnot, before our meals arrived.

Let me just start by saying that I truly hate eating in big parties. It's always a fiasco and this dinner was no exception.  We were supposed to be a party of eight but some of the girls were running late. They seated us and took our order right away. Half an hour later we were all kind of wondering where the heck our food was. Thank god we brought a bottle of champagne to keep us entertained!  When the other girls showed up they wanted to order too. An hour had now passed from the time we originally ordered and everyone was starving! We heard this crash come from the kitchen and I just KNEW it was one of the dishes we ordered hitting the floor. I was right and it took them another half hour to remake the pasta. Fifteen more minutes went by before the girls who arrived late were served their dinners, (we waited an hour, one girl waited an hour and a half, and the girls who showed up late waited 45 minutes).  After spending three hours at the table we were all relieved when it was time to pay the bill. Somehow the waitress totally screwed up what was supposed to go on each card so we ended up waiting around another twenty minutes for the Manager to fix it. It was just a big mess and we were all glad to get the heck out of there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2
Heather O.,"Roseville, CA",150,209,150,4.0,6/2/2011,"Though the staff is completely sweet and I think they are spectacular. My pizza got dropped on the ground and had to wait for another pizza, and it was a take-out order so all the rest of my items were cold by the time I got back to the hotel. I think at this point, the pizza re-order should have been complimentary without asking. Particularly when you have an empty restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2
Ashley S.,"San Diego, CA",97,116,32,2.0,7/7/2009,"This isn't my first CPK experience but I would have to say it wasn't my favorite. It was one of those times when you feel like you are looking for your waitress the entire time.  The food was blah, not as good as usual. The waitress recommended the Thai Chicken Pizza and it was super salty. I usually stay more traditional with pizza so maybe it was my bad for going away from the norm.... All in all its a little less the okay",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-2
