Julie S.,"Cheyenne, WY",1,4,,5.0,8/31/2012,I was there late on a Sunday evening after a day of travel to Tucson.  I enjoyed a $6 appetizer and $3 glass of wine - part of their all day Sunday happy hour.  My waiter treated me like I was the only customer he had and the rest of the staff was happy and very friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson
Andy H.,"Seattle, WA",22,201,3,1.0,1/14/2006,"I wouldn't normally go out of my way to review a $5 food-and-beer happy hour stop at a chain restaurant unless it was a special location in some way.  This TGI Friday's location is definitely special.  Chain restaurant happy hours are nice and cheap and after 10, but this place was empty and took forever.  It's really too bad, since nobody goes here, and it's easy to take a large group of people when Applebee's is always too packed to seat lots of people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-tucson
