R G.,"Avondale, AZ",3,40,24,3.0,8/8/2017,"Stopped by because we wanted some familiar America food, after eating Puerto Rican food for almost 2 weeks. Happy to say this Chili's didn't let us down.  The service was actually the best we had during our 2 weeks in PR and the taste was that of home. Dessert was amazing, try it :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aguadilla
Caleb H P.,"Carolina, Puerto Rico",3,19,3,2.0,10/20/2016,Had to wait for service about 10 minutes. Finally I moved to the bar and they took care of me. When food arrived was less than warm. I hate to return food but this time I couldn't eat it so I ordered something else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aguadilla
Erica S.,"Carmel Valley, CA",169,20,,3.0,11/29/2016,"Went with a big group (about 20). Service was horrible, they gave us 1 waitress who mixed up EVERY order (food and drink). The only saving grace was that my chicken salad was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aguadilla
Joel L.,"Orlando, FL",22,11,8,1.0,10/8/2016,Slowest service ever seen. Lousy cold food. This place sucks adding to this review. After waiting 40 minutes for a seat my daughter never got her meal  she s finally got it after everyone else was done. The manager did not seem to concerned of the situation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aguadilla
CC R.,"Orlando, FL",71,103,117,2.0,10/14/2015,"Not to many Restaurants in the area have AC. This place does, but don't expect the food to be like other Chili's . The items you order are a smaller cheaper version of what's pictured and what's at other locations. Maybe it's because of the area. But the staff was super friendly and clean restrooms. We ordered the fajitas (beef and chicken), the quesadilla explosion salad and a kids chicken meal. All were smaller portions and tasted mediocre, very different from other locations in the U.S. (We've been to the Chili's in San Juan too). Just disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aguadilla
Vimarys C.,"San Antonio, TX",17,29,188,5.0,1/19/2015,"Excellent location, atmosphere and service. The waiters are the friendliest, knowledgeable of the menu. They seem very happy to help the customers. Will recommend and will go back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aguadilla
John B.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,7,1,1.0,11/30/2014,"Awful service even for a chilis. The service was poor and when I explained my daughter had a peanut allergy it was as if I had 3 heads, and I speak Spanish fluently. Stay away as corporate should really take a look and make great changes because it's just downright wrong how they handle people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-aguadilla
