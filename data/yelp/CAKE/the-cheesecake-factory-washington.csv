Helena F.,"Derwood, MD",68,218,91,4.0,12/19/2017,"This was my first cheesecake factory experience and I must say I was a little overwhelmed by the LENGTH of the menu. Salads, burgers, pasta, pizza... EVERYTHING you might think of. This makes it a great place for the crowd. They do have the amount of calories next to every single item. Well, I do not know if this is the information I need to know when getting my cheesecake fix ;) Since we came here for lunch we mostly got stuff from the lunch specials. Those were still some pretty huge portions. I got almond chicken sandwich (which was tasty) and it came with ceasar and a bowl of tomato soup (I think this varies according to the offer of the soup of the day).  Overall this was rather a positive experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Len P.,"Washington, DC",60,85,11,3.0,1/10/2018,"Food is always good here but service is SUPER spotty - far more so than the several other Cheesecake Factory locations in the area or elsewhere. For example, 2 weeks ago I came in on a quiet night and sat at the bar. Immediately and friendly service. Tonight I went in, got seated and sat for 25 minutes while waiter after waitress walked by and left me alone. I was 5 feet from the front desk so it's not like they couldn't see I hadn't been helped. Very frustrating and though I've eaten at this location several times before (with equally inconsistent service, though never ignored for quite so long) I doubt I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Jynnah R.,"Washington, DC",108,87,159,2.0,12/22/2017,"I have been here a couple of times and had a different server each time but they all seem so sad. There is a movie theatre across the street where a friend and I always come from afterwards to the factory.  Every time we come here our server just seems so sad. Like they all seem like they don't want to be there. I wonder if it is management? Someone should check?  While the food is pretty good, It takes forever even though every time we are there, it is never full or half full. The food is always pretty good, it's Cheesecake Factory, there menu doesn't change so it's pretty consistent. No complaints on our actual dishes, but you have to ask for bread and they bring you a chunk of butter.  It's just not the best atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Gellie E.,"Washington, DC",123,260,623,2.0,11/22/2017,"Recommend for a happy hour. They offer several of their appetizers for about $6-$8 (no more $5 apps), which is still a good deal. We ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes and chicken samosas. The tamale cakes were refreshing and filling. The chicken samosas were essentially ground chicken in triangles - no potatoes or veggies that a traditional samosa has. They were greasy and I would not get again. We also ordered an entree off of the regular menu and just a note - the complimentary bread was not good. The bread wasn't quite room temperature, but practically. Our refill batch (we like our carbs), was cold and stale - but maybe that's what we get for asking for a refill. No qualms about service; it was adequate. They have a to-go counter on their upper level, where we got some cheesecakes for the road (because you can't go to Cheesecake Factory without getting cheesecake!). But all in all, not my favorite Cheesecake Factory location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Eric H.,"Washington, DC",171,32,14,3.0,9/15/2017,"For whatever reason I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. So when a coworker was looking for a place in the barren Friendship Heights to have his last lunch before leaving the company, we decided on Cheesecake Factory. Nothing much to say about this place other than it's extremely cookie cutter and exactly what I expected. It's essentially a Chili's with a nicer interior and more expensive food. We got some appetizers which were tasty but really heavy. Then we all had a different salad and they were drenched in dressing. Pretty much par for the course. Either way, it was a good time. Service was a bit slow, but no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Rithi C.,"Baltimore, MD",453,117,138,4.0,6/14/2017,"Came here with my girlfriend for a quick lunch. The restaurant was busy, but we were able to get a table for two. The waitress was polite and very accommodating: I told her that we were in a hurry and she was happy to give us our bill when our food arrived. We both ordered a burger - mine medium (as it should be) and hers well-done (....). It took a while for our burgers to arrive because a well-done burger takes longer, but they were both tasty and more than filling. The Cheesecake Factory is known for their (You guessed it!) cheesecake, but we didn't have time to get dessert this time. If the quality of cheesecakes is consistent across these venues, then I'm sure theirs is fantastic. A nice sit-down venue for lunch or dinner; I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Marco M.,"McLean, VA",138,103,35,2.0,12/18/2017,I've been ordering a large catering orders ($600+) from Cheesecake Factory for the past two years and every year there is always a delay.  My pick up time is always 11:30am (that's the earliest available) and I never leave until 12 noon.  My special requests are never completed. This is the main reason why there's always a delay.  This year they couldn't locate my catering order which was very surprising to me because I called last Friday and Monday morning to confirm.  Their customer service isn't the greatest; I never got an apology after waiting over 30 minutes and for messing up my special requests I made for the order. I will definitely not return here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Rebecca W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1970,931,7784,4.0,12/22/2017,"This was super convenient, especially after a long day of DC activities. My family and I were happy to get back to our hotel and eat some real food. Before this, it was overpriced zoo food, so we needed some fare a couple steps above. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, but it's fairly consistent everywhere I have been. Dim lighting, ample seating and the cheesecake case right in the front, so you can drool while you wait for your food or wait to be seated. The staff here was nice, but after we got our order, one of the staff seemed a bit snippety after I asked for some to-go utensils. Whatever. Food was ready within 20 minutes and we were on our way up to our rooms to get our grub on. Ordered a burger, crab bites/balls and an Oreo cheesecake. The food was tasty and quite filling. These days, I just like to take bites of food and I feel like I've eaten a complete meal. So, from what I tasted, I was satisfied with. The fries were not all that crispy, but oh well, can't win 'em all right? This is located in the Chevy Chase Shopping Plaza. There is a possibility we'll be back before we check out of our hotel, since it is so close and their cheesecake is always something I have enjoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington

Julia G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",22,121,532,3.0,4/25/2017,"Went last night for a group dinner with work. Cheesecake Factory is never my choice of dinner in a big city that has lots of great, local, farm to table options, but tonight was not bad. Ordered the herb crusted salmon which usually comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus, but just swapped out the mashed potatoes for the snow peas side and I'm so glad I did! The snow peas were mixed with some zucchini and onions and tasted great. So did the salmon. Everything was done nicely on the plate.  Ordered a lemon raspberry cheesecake which I haven't had in years but was as light as I remember it compared to some of the very heavy cheesecakes that they serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Lisa G.,"Washington, DC",26,104,153,4.0,12/24/2017,"I didn't feel like cooking two days before Christmas so we treated ourselves to dinner while shopping in Friendship Heights. There were a good amount of people in the restaurant and we opted to dine on the second floor. The hostess was friendly and we were promptly seated. We already knew what we wanted so were ready to order as soon as we sat down so were a bit disappointed when it took our server 5 minutes to greet us and ask us what we wanted. After we ordered, our server Damani) brought out water (he forgot the lemon wedges) and bread (it was not warm like it usually is). Our loaded baked potato tots arrived pretty quickly and they were delicious. Our entrees, chicken chipotle pasta and bistro shrimp pasta, came out soon thereafter and were also yummy. We ate maybe half of our entrees (such big portions) and ordered snickers cheesecake (it was a pretty small slice) to go. Overall, the food was a 4.5 but the service was a 3. Still, Cheesecake Factory is always a fave so we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington
Shelly J.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",336,181,801,3.0,11/12/2016,"Average experience So after watching a nice movie, my friend and I wanted something light. Hostess wasnt really friendly, first she strutted across her booth to take us to the table by the cold glass door. I was going to sit but my friend, flat out told her no, thats not happening. Can we get a better table please?! Hostess seemed offended that she had asked. Moving on, waiter took his time in getting to us. It wasnt that busy. (9pm) I wanted crab  wontons and apple crisp and my friend got a salad. Food came out fast. My crab wontons barely tasted like crab. It was more like eating deep fried cream cheese balls. The dipping sauce was horrific. Menu stated: sweet chili sauce that was a lie. I got some rice vinegar dressing with red pepper flakes swimming in it. I couldnt eat it. So, my waiter pulled a disappearing act. Never checked on us. My friends salad, she liked it. The manager was the food runner and brought my apple crisp and my friend got cheesecake.  The apple crisp was good. It made my night better. Finally waiter shows up because its time to pay. Next time we will sit at the bar and I dont recommend the crab wontons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington

Chris D.,"Washington, DC",399,44,18,1.0,4/18/2017,"Tuesday night... my cousin & I went to this location. It's closest to both of us. We got there around 10:30....the bar was packed... We waited because we didn't wanna sit at a table.  Finally we sat down at the bar. Brooke C was the bartender. I asked for a taste of Rose... the restaurant was completely out of it. This big huge component of a big corporation was out of Rose! Cousin ordered Riesling & I Pinot Grigio . We each had 2 glasses of each. Appetizers: she: crab & artichoke dip, Greek salad (with NO ONIONS- she sent it back.....yet again it came back with opinions {but she was so hungry}) . I ordered my usual fried Mac & cheese balls (they were smaller....didn't have as much flavor or sauce) MAINS: Cousin: got the Miso salmon. The miso glaze was thick like BBQ sauce & wasn't as hot as it should've been . Me: my usual shrimp scampi ....with extra noodles & extra sauce! However my noodles were COLD!!! The shrimp were lukewarm. I was like how in the hell are you gonna try to gimme cold noodles tho? * So my cousin & I told Brooke C. She actually asked me did I want her to reheat just the pasta or the whole thing? My cousin & I were thrown off like did she just ask us did she want her to reheat this food ? Or did I want them to make a new dish. I work in food & beverage so I know the behind the scenes tricks kitchen's use in a situation like this. How dare she ask me if  I want her to reheat it? !""!""! I was DISGUSTED ! To me , a customer I had visions of them throwing it in the microwave . So I sent it back the WHOLE THING to have a new plate made. A manager comes down. We tell her what's happened. She says ""oh no we don't use a microwave! We can basically toss it in a pan & re plate it or make a totally fresh plate...takes like 5 minutes?"" Why would a fresh entree ever take 5 MINUTES? My cousin had already been suffering through her lukewarm food... Finally mine comes out... By this point I'm so over the experience but yet still hungry. I was so disappointed... This was just an AWFUL experience. Cold food, asking if I wanted it reheated?. Could've been prevented! I just cannot believe this even happened.

Linda L.,"Rockville, MD",79,185,308,3.0,7/4/2017,"The restaurant is located in downtown Chevy Chase. There is street parking nearby or garage parking for a fee. Outdoor and indoor seating are available, and this location occupies two floors. On this day, we arrived right when they opened at 11:30am and were able to snag seats indoors close to the window which provided a great view of the streets. The tables are arranged close to one another, so that is one thing to consider if you prefer more privacy. I ordered an egg white omelette with veggies and goat cheese. For the custom omelette, you can add up to four toppings and it comes with toast and tomatoes/house potatoes. The portions here are very generous, so make room for dessert! The menu is endless with breakfast served all day and a separate Sunday brunch and of course, cheesecake menu. My omelette came out perfectly constructed; however, the goat cheese was not spread throughout. The house potatoes were somewhat bland since there was not enough seasoning.  Our waitress, Jordan checked on us several times and the service was good. She was also attentive with refills which was a plus on this hot day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington

The service was pretty slow, but we didn't really mind because we had nowhere to be.  UNTIL we get to parking lot and find out the validation only takes off $2 so we had to pay for 3+ hours of parking anyway.

She did a great job of double checking on ingredients in a certain dish or cocktail and accommodating for substitutions.

Barbara P.,"Reston, VA",263,192,88,3.0,1/27/2016,"According to Montgomery County Code Chapter 15, Section 15-15a, restaurants are required to post calorie counts for standard menu items for at least 60 days each year. I carry a heavy burden for knowing the calorie count for a slice of red velvet cheesecake, which is DELICIOUS, FYI. Skip if you don't want to know. Have you removed your eyeballs down a few lines? It's a whopping melonfarming one thousand five hundred forty (1,540) calories. Skip skippity skip. Service was great-- we had a table of 12 but our waitress was super nice when it came to splitting checks. I shared the Spinach Dip and Louisiana Chicken Pasta  which is wise considering the very 'murican portions. Despite my attempts to be less spherical, I still ordered a slice of red velvet cheesecake-- half for here, and half to go! I then peer pressured others into sharing 770 calories with me. Now for #firstworldproblem. The ladies' restroom was oddly lacking-- the stalls are cramped, especially for anyone that's just eaten at this establishment (see portion comment above). Of 3 stalls, one didn't have a functioning lock, forcing me to run over with my pants around my ankles to the larger handicap stall (partially joking). One of two soap dispensers just has a hole in the counter. Step ya game up Chevy Chase Cheesecake Chfactory! Oh yeah... and parking still came out to a buttload despite the validation.

Mell H.,"Olney, MD",159,65,71,2.0,1/28/2016,"I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory-- in fact, it's one of my family's usual go-to places after we do some shopping at Westfield Montgomery mall in Rockville. My mom, sister and I decided to eat at the Friendship Heights location after doing some shopping around the area but we were sorely disappointed. The food and service was noticeably shabbier than the Rockville branch. We ordered the Thai veggie wraps, crispy fish tacos, a fried mac and cheese burger, and the lemon meringue cheesecake. Our server was quick to take our orders but she brought out our food very late which was my biggest complaint for today's dinner. A couple sitting across the room from us arrived later than my trio, ordered after us, and still got their food a good 15 minutes before us even though they had ordered very similar items (burger and tacos) The burger and Thai lettuce wraps were excellent! The lettuce wraps in particular are so fresh, delicious, and flavorful! My family always gets them when we come to Cheesecake, especially because everything else we order tends to be fried and heavy haha. You won't be dissapointed with the quality of the vegetables or size of the dish.  The biggest let down of the evening and the reason for my 2 star review was the fish tacos. The fish itself was crispy and tasteful, but the rice, which is great at the Rockville location, was dry, tasteless, and stale. The two lime wedges that came with the tacos were dry to the point that they were hard to the touch (i couldn't even squeeze the juice out of them). The marinated onions had soaked the bottom of the tortilla and caused it to mush up. It all became clear to me then: the tacos had been left underneath the heating lamp for way too long. I don't know what happened in the kitchen or with our waitress, but the tacos had been ruined due to neglect. I could have forgiven the bad rice if it was simply bad rice, but could I overlook an amalgamate of crusty rice, crusty limes, soggy tacos, caused by our overly long wait for food? No way. Anyways, I don't think my review is reflective of the branch as a while. The food overall is better at the Rockville branch, but tonight's major issue regarding the lackluster fish tacos could have been avoided entirely if the food had reached us in a timely manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=40

My waitress's extremely long hair weave literally TOUCHED the bread, because the hair was so long. After finally getting our food, mine was cold. Another's sandwich bread was so hard, it wouldn't break when slammed against the table. We finally ordered desserts after 30 more minutes. It took 40 minutes to get the cheesecake- no joke.

Lauren S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",39,110,164,3.0,8/25/2017,"I'd like to give 3 1/2 stars.  My rating is based on several factors - my dinner, my friend's dinner and the service.  We started with the Chicken Potstickers off the Skinnylicious menu.  The Potstickers were so wonderful  - soft with a tasty filling in a fabulous garlic ginger sauce.   Then I got the Skinnylicious Veggie Burger, with a side Caesar Salad.   The veggie burger was enormous and delicious on a soft bun.  I could only eat half because it was so large and filling.  I had the option of getting a house salad or a Ceasar Salad and I'm so glad I got the latter.  The Salad was fantastic with good dressing, crunchy croutons and a sprinkling of shredded Romano.  It was really a very good salad.  My friend was not so happy with his meal.   He got the Meatloaf with mashed potatoes and succotash.   I didn't taste his meal but he thought the seasoning in the meatloaf was unusual, it wasn't the standard meatloaf flavor he was craving and so he was disappointed.  He thought the mashed potatoes were good, but then thought the succotash was odd because the ingredients were unexpected - peppers, corn and zuccchini.  If I had to sum up, his expectations were different than the reality. Sometimes that turns out well, and sometimes not.   We both enjoyed the warm Apple Crisp with vanilla ice cream.   The staff was very friendly - we were greeted warmly at the door, and our server was friendly and knowledgeable and efficient.   The restaurant is loud - on each of the two levels.  At this location they have outdoors seating off the lower level, which is a nice option.   They don't take reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=20

It's been like 2 years since we went to a Cheesecake Factory but it was worth it for the strong drinks and great food deals for happy hour! Wesley served us and he was just awesome. He was really attentive, made sure we got our drinks before happy hour ended, and was overall really pleasant. After having a pretty crummy day, he was a joy to have! The food was good, too. The happy hour burger was actually the size of a real burger and it was no hassle to get fries on the side. I didn't care for the rice with my steak tacos, but the tacos themselves were pretty tasty.

Wanted a quick snack between shopping & football, hence the craving for the Avocados Egg Rolls called us.  Walked in, zero'd in on a table by the window on the 1st floor.  Hostess said hi & welcomed, I said hi back & asked if we could have that table, she said sure & allow her to clean off it 1st, works for me.  We got situated, she came back with menus & told us that Mike would be serving us. That he did, what outstanding serving & social skills he exuded.  He was very pleasant, engaging & knew the menu.  Mike also was proactive & stay on accord in checking on us through out. After we demolished the yummy Avocado Egg Rolls, we did decided to try one of their new salads, the Vegan Cobb Salad, say it an't so CF. Not only was the portion enormous as we were so happy we decided to share, yet those ingredients were bomblicious!  It came with & placed in a nice foodie precision layout of Grilled Asparagus, Green Beans, Roasted Beets, Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato, Garbanzo Beans, Quinoa, Almonds & Sunflower Seeds with their very tasting special House Vinaigrette.  I would just love when CF makes a Vegan Cheesecake, yet until then, here are some Vegan/Veggie options to share:  Veggie Burger (without cheese/mayo) on their sourdough or wheat bread. Pasta with the rigatoni, which is vegan, tossed in olive oil instead of butter & 86 the parmesan cheese, you are golden to enjoy some good options.  Salads galore...of course.

Rachel H.,"Rockville, MD",74,205,62,2.0,6/28/2017,"Where do I began with this review? We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory around 8 on a Tuesday night and found no wait time. We visit their other locations and are basically always happy but we won't be back to this one. Our sever just couldn't get it together and it became increasingly clear that he just didn't care. We were seated for about fifteen minutes before having to flag down two severs for the bread. One of the nice things about going to The Cheesecake Factory is eating bread while browsing the menu. While ordering I asked for certain items to be left off, I was informed that the sever isn't able to accommodate the request due to the system. We typically come once or twice a month and I always get the same time... with the accommodations. I'm pretty sure the sever just didn't want to put in the extra work. We finally got the bread and our food (without the accommodations) came right after. The table across from us sent their bill back three times and the sever still couldn't seem to figure it out. I'm not exactly sure where our sever went during the course of the meal. I asked for ranch and by the time the sever came back I didn't need it anymore. The sever even mentioned that it had taken him ten minutes. Eventually we got our bill and everything was surprising correct. However; the bill was rung up wrong and when we tried to use a gift card we got the balance slip but no giftcard. It took another ten minutes for him to come back with it. I honestly felt like we spent more time correcting issues and looking for our sever than we spent enjoying our meal. We won't be back to this exact location.

Linda O.,"Washington, DC",146,207,55,3.0,3/6/2015,"They have an infinite number of offerings--a regular menu, a skinny menu, a cheesecake menu and a booze menu. Talk about choices; it's almost mind-bending. I have had some good experiences here. And not so. Kids like it; the name lures them (and parents) in. I've caved to the pressure of teenagers plotting to go here. The salads are reasonable; quinoa & kale salad and ceasar salad are go-tos for me. A few appetizers aren't bad; crispy crab bites and hot artichoke dip are safe. It's the main entrees that I find myself objecting to. Last time I ordered the southern fried catfish platter; the catfish was decent, but canned corn as a side? Are you kidding me? For the price I was paying? The green beans were as tough as clothes pins, too. The cheesecake is agreeable, nothing phenomenal. The bread that accompanies the meal is so so, although freely offered. The restaurant itself feels cold to me no matter what season. All that tile and stone--on the floor, tabletops, bar, staircases--invites the chill factor. Service is usually satisfactory. When this Cheesecake Factory first opened in DC a few years back, it was all the rage.   The food is generally acceptable.

Rizma W.,"Washington, DC",106,591,510,4.0,2/12/2015,"This has recently become one of my favorite places for happy hour. Lucky for me, it is also very close to my office. A lot of bars and restaurants have 3-5 dishes on their happy hour menu and a similar number of drinks.  Cheesecake Factory offers at least two pages of delicious options for every palate. From crab rangoons and cheeseburger sliders, to Vietnamese shrimp egg rolls and tamale cakes smothered in salsa verde, this is the place to come if you want to do more than just drink the day away. And the prices are GREAT, especially for this part of town. Most of the happy hour dishes are $5-$7, and the drink specials offered are usually about the same (depending in what you order, of course). According to one of the bartenders, the restaurant has an arrangement with the Beringer vineyards, which makes a Merlot exclusively for the Cheesecake Factory. It's one of my favorite wines at any restaurant; juicy and just slighty sweet. I could easily drink that stuff by the bottle.  And it goes without saying that the cheesecake is amazing. That's a given. There are very few things in life that a slice of chocolate chip cookie dough or red velvet cheesecake cannot fix. Period. The only reason that this isn't a 5 star experience is because the staff is iffy. I've have attentive and fun bartenders and I've also had inattentive ones that would rather discuss personal issues with their coworkers with a bar full of customers. Parking is available of nearby side streets, but it can be a little tricky to find at the that time of day. Fortunately, the Metro is located just across the street, and there is a parking lot very close to the restaurant, as well. (There is no street parking from 4-6:30 pm on weekdays.

Thanks!    I was bummed that my fav, the calamari was no longer a part of the HH menu.  I'm not sure if that is for all locations or just the Friendship Heights location.  When we got there, there was plenty of seats in the bar area.  We chose to sit at one of the high top tables.  HH there is from 4-6pm.  We got there right after 4pm. We ordered the crab dip and the buffalo blasts.  The crab dip was ok, nothing special, but not bad.  It had a real heavy fatty flavor.  The buffalo blasts were also fatty, but I loved them.  They were super crispy w/ an intense flavor and I loved the buffalo dipping sauce.  The buffalo blasts came with so much!  All the HH apps were $5 bucks, you can't beat that.  They def are not cheap with the portions.

The wheat bread is delicious! It's topped with whole rolled oatmeal. They do offer the white bread; but get the wheat. And the bread is free! I was able to avoid a slice of cheesecake which I have thought about every day since I visited. The red velvet, pumpkin and the white chocolate and vanilla are all divine! Red velvet, red velvet! Mmm mmm!  So since I avoided cheesecake but was still hungry and clearly not cooking myself dinner; I opted for the Skinnylicious chicken samosas and the seared ahi tuna salad.  The Skinnylicious chicken samosas are good; but they were greasy. Kind of not so Skinnylicious in my opinion. Maybe they should bake them instead? The seared ahi tuna salad is good!

Erika M.,"Washington, DC",150,145,14,2.0,8/29/2016,"I came to Cheesecake Factory on Saturday evening to celebrate my birthday with one of my close friends. I've come to this location several times in the past and have always had a great time. Unfortunately, this past weekend, I cannot say the same. My friend and I decided amongst ourselves that our server had to have been brand new - that's the only way we could remain patient and polite with such disappointing service. I had to ask twice for sweetener for my iced tea. We had to ask for bread to be brought out. The bread finally came, but the server seemed to not think that silverware or plates were necessary. Had to ask for those. I ordered the brown-butter roasted carrots with pecans as one of my side dishes. It came out of the kitchen as just a plate of warm carrots. I asked the server where the butter and pecans were and she said ""I didn't know it was supposed to come with pecans."" I'm guessing she missed menu training?! I know from my own history as a server that it's a really nice touch to include a container of whatever sauce came on the plate with people's leftovers when they're packed to go. I can't say that I was surprised that she didn't pack me a container of the delicious remoulade that accompanied my fried catfish, but as I am eating these plain leftovers, I really wish she'd thought to do that.  In addition to my own poor service, there was another server working the patio alongside my server this particular night. I was sitting two tables away as I heard him complaining to a table about a table that had just left and how did they didn't tip. He gave a monologue about the frustrations of ""paying to be here"" because he had to tip out the bar and the bussers and whoever else and it really just upsets him when people ""don't tip for no reason."" If I wasn't already distracted by the fact that he was wearing shorts, which is generally unacceptable at any place above a bar, I was definitely distracted by him speaking that way.  All in all, the food was delicious, but the service really detracted from my overall experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=60

This was our first time at this specific location. We were seated immediately on this Monday evening, and the place was packed. Not what I expected for a Monday night. Our server was really attentive and very nice. I have probably tried almost everything here (sadly). I have been coming here for years and it's rare I have ordered something I don't like. This specific night, I ordered a few small plates to share. Mexican style chicken lettuce tacos, tuna tartare, fried calamari and grilled artichoke. My eating partners ordered burgers which looked fairly decent. I really love their small plates, salads and appetizers. They really do rock in these departments.  The chicken tacos were super fresh here, really flavorful. The artichoke was perfectly cooked and the calamari was tender. Not dry and over-fried.

After asking to speak with the manager to inform her of the not so great service and multiple health code violations.. she simply dismissed us stating that if we wanted to leave, we should.

Their cashew chicken is OK. Burgers are solid. Flatbread sandwich is decent, even if it pales in comparison to what you might have in Navajo country.  Lots of choices for appetizers too... most of them good. My favorite are the sliders - some of the best I've had. The lettuce wraps are good. The calamari is OK.

We ordered water, but they brought orange juice instead. We ordered mashed potatoes as side, but they brought coleslaw. We ordered salad and there was piece of hair in the salad.

Vania C.,"Washington, DC",96,110,84,4.0,7/29/2014,"I am really tempted to give this place 3 stars for their slow service and long wait but I Cheesecake Factory restaurants is generally always packed, and even more so during dinner rush hours. If only they took reservations...Regardless. the food was decent and the staff was friendly, so in the end, I gave it 4 stars. FOOD = 4.5 stars I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, which tasted well enough, but I should've gone with my first choice, Four Cheese pasta. If I was gonna order carbs anyway, might as well go out. But no, I tried to be healthy and avoid the cheese and totally regretted it. My friend sitting across from me ended up ordeirng the Four Cheese pasta and it was mocking me the entire night. Portion size is defintely huge. I couldn't finish my pasta in one sitting and had to bring it home. I'm personally not a huge fan of cheesecake, but all of my friends raved about the chocolate & peanut butter cheesecake so I'll just go out on a limb and assume it was good. SERVICE = 3.5 stars One word: SLOW. If it weren't for the fact that we were an hour and a half away from campus, I wouldn't wait 2 hours for my food. The wait was long, and after a day of shopping, we were all starving. For dinner, I recommend coming early around 5pm or later around 8pm. Definitely avoid the dinner rush between 6-7pm. Food was served around 20 minutes after we ordered, but our waiter was clearly preoccupied with other tables. We had to try really hard to get his attention when we wanted more water, order cheesecake for dessert, and pay the check. PRICE = 4 stars A little pricey bc we were in DC but still worth it, given the amount of food they give. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta was around $14-15.

We ordered a 10 inches ""The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"" over the phone to be picked up by April 13th which is today. When we came it was already almost 7pm, so we have decided to have dinner since we haven't eaten yet. We told the server we ordered a whole cheesecake over the phone and asked her if she's going to give it to us before we leave, she said yes! she is going to give it to us before we leave. An hour later, when we were about to leave she told us that it's better to pick the cheesecake up ourselves from the bakery so we can see the cheesecake and etc. then we said, ok no big deal. So we went to the bakery and asked for the cheesecake we ordered over the phone. As soon as we got home, I took the box out of the bag and saw the exterior side of the box has lots of chocolate stain probably the person who put the cake in the box has DIRTY HANDS and didn't even wipe the box at least!!!!! So I opened the box immediately to see if everything was good. Holy moly! you can't believe what I just saw! A 53 dollar 10 inches DESTROYED ULTIMATE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE!!!!!! The person who put the cake in the box was responsible for this. He/she didn't put the cake carefully and properly knowing that cakes are FRAGILE!!! 4 slices of cheesecake which are worth almost 32 dollars was damaged and the toppings/icing was all over the box. It was so terrible!!!! Obviously you can see it yourself in the attached photos. That cake I ordered is for the surprise 80th birthday partyof my dying Father-in-law!!!!

I favorite dishes include the bread at the beginning of your meal (I could eat loaves and loaves of the stuff) and the following: Thai Lettuce wraps: Three different sauces: chili, peanut, and something else.  Giant lettuce leaves, grilled chicken with peanuts, noodles, cucumbers, carrots, etc to make perfect lettuce tacos.  I'm a big fan of the grilled chicken slices over the ground up meat you typically see at other restaurants. Avocado egg rolls:  YUM.  I love avocado especially when its wrapped in a deep fried shell.  The dipping sauce gives it a pretty interesting flare.

AccioSoyMilk ..,"Richland, MS",20,64,,3.0,5/29/2015,"I had a job interview in the area and decided to visit. I've only been to the Cheesecake Factory once in my life, and as this one (which was not the same I one I had visited previously) close to the Metro (right across the street), I zeroed in on this place to eat. The restaurant seems a little small and cramped when you enter, but then again I didn't go upstairs, so maybe it was spacious. The hostess offered to seat me in a small seat that is right in view of anyone who walks in. At first I was going to be like, ""Fine,"" but I saw that they had more (better!) seating inside.  I was actually right next to the kitchen entrance, but I was okay with that because that meant there was no one to the right of me and it meant my food would come out all that much faster. :P My server was fantastic. I'm not 100% of her name, but she was super friendly, always with a smile while not being uber creepy that some servers are. If she was having a bad day or just wanted the Friday to end, I definitely couldn't tell. I could also see she provided the same service and courtesy to my neighboring diners, including noting any special requests if made. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, I was brought water and I made my order. I got a chicken almond salad sandwich and a green salad and a green iced tea. I was hungrrrrryyyyy. But the iced tea came out in good time and the main course was reasonable by most standards (maybe not by my tummy, but whatever). I'm actually confused. I got a bowl of soup even though I thought that was an entirely separate item. It was tasty, a cheese and vegetable chicken soup. The salad had too much dressing (should have requested it on the side) so that the leaves on the bottom were soggy. It was good, but it was too much. The sandwich itself was a little disappointing: it was like they had cut out the middle of bread and called it a serving. I swear the pieces were perhaps the width of two of my fingers, and I have small hands! It tasted good, but it was kind of a pathetic serving. But for the most part everything tasted good. I ate, but as I said, stuff like the salad had too much dressing. I finished and spent a few minutes reading when my server came back to take away my plate. I requested their Godiva brownie sundae, no whipped cream. She repeated my order and said it's coming right up. I did enjoy the brownie sundae, but it was a little too much. Too much brownie that was very rich, and not enough ice cream to balance out. I made it about 2/3 of the way through but couldn't finish. It'd be a great dessert to share, but I wasn't expecting the brownie to be so rich. Ugh, I could feel my clothes expanding from the fat, right then and there. :) As I ate, I got my check. It was expensive. Everything was about $25, not including tip. I'm still not sure what happened with my salad/sandwich thing and wonder if there was a miscommunication somewhere. But it was nice to visit. I probably wouldn't come here on my own again for awhile since it's just a little too much, but it was fun to see what this location was like and the service was really good (except for the seating in the beginning, perhaps).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=140

I also ordered a side of sliders which were tasty and filling, but definitely nothing out of the norm. As I was filling up I looked around and noticed just about everyone had ordered a slice of cheesecake to round out their meal. As I ate, all I could think of was ""Damn, does everyone need to get cheesecake when they come here?"" I had absolutely no plans, thoughts or desires to have any. At all. That is until the bartender told me they had a brand new type of cheesecake that consisted of some of my favorite things: red velvet cake layered between cheesecake and topped with white chocolate icing and shaved, solid white chocolate.  The slice was massive and I vowed only to have a few bites and take the rest home. It was smooth, creamy and the red velvet tasted like it was from scratch, but again it didn't rock my world.

I've posted photos of each dish. 1) Sweet corn fritters. Six good-sized, succulent fritters containing whole kernals and batter fried perfectly. These are very good, although not as sublime as the crispy nearly-all-kernals variety served at the E&O Trading Company in my home town (San Jose, Calif), which I hold as the standard by which I judge corn fritters. 2) Butter lettuce chicken wraps (Mexican).  Three leaves of lettuce stuffed with shredded slaw-like greens, a small piece of grilled chicken, avocado, onions & salsa. They come in a clever zig-zag rack lined with squares of waxed paper. With the chicken and avocado on top of the shredded slaw, these wraps are tough to hold.  I'd recommend putting the chicken and avocado in first, and top with the slaw. But they were tasty and satisfying. 3) Crab balls.  Six small balls are served on a hot tray. I would have liked to have seen a higher proportion of crab to breading, but these had a good crab aroma and taste. The texture is very soft ... they fall apart if you try to cut them into two bite-sized pieces. Each of these came with a small cup of tasty sauce.  None of them needed it, however ... they were plenty tasty by themselves.  I just dabbed each to the sauce at times.  The crab balls usually fell apart, unfortunately. The wrap's was a thin sweet-spicy sauce ... very nice. All in all, excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=160

Cheesecake Factory."" ""Cheesecake Factory took me to Macaroni Grill for a date and spent the entire time 'talking politics' with nonstop Jon Stewart quotes.""  1. Hilarious. 2. This perfectly encapsulates for me why Cheesecake Factory has almost become cool again in recent years. The original big box restaurant for surburban bores, the seminal font of ginormous portions and impossibly long menus, the promised land for fourth-graders all over the country: It's now almost self-parodying, and therefore it's a lot more fun to visit than any of the competitors it's spawned. My high school friends and I - who visited this location once or twice a month between 2000 and 2003 - recently reunited here for dinner. My eggplant sandwich was the size of my head. Pasta wasn't served on plates so much as wallowed into tureens. Our waiter - who seemed, like every Cheesecake waiter I can remember, to be an aspiring actor - could not take an order or pick up a plate without saying ""TEN-FOUR!"" or ""EIGHTY-SIXED!"" in a voice so full of zazzy enthusiasm that I had no trouble imagining he went home to an apartment full of mutilated hobo corpses. The entrees, while caloric, were tasty. Prices were reasonable, considering that the leftovers were going to feed us for days. Drinks were so generously poured that I was stumbling after two wines.  The real letdown was the cookie dough cheesecake, which came on a crust that tasted like crumbled cardboard and featured far less cookie dough than I remembered. I was sad to see that the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake had disappeared from the menu - that thing took excess to new levels. I miss high school.

As always, my service is attentive and very polite.  I occassionally have to stop the server to ask for a refill, but I also drink faster than the normal female, and it tends to be a bit crowded during happy hour.   About the food.  I will admit that I've fallen in love w/the Spicy Chipotle Chix Pasta(minus the chix, extra spicy), and refuse to get anything else.  Even when I tell myself to try something else, I just can't pull away.  Please look into it the next time you go.  Also, the J.W.'s Pink Lemonade IS the business!  I drink that shit like it's juice, and that's why the servers can't keep up...not their fault.

Pastas could feed an entire household per order, and the burgers are borderline inedible they're so big. Even their Skinnylicious menu portions are huge! I'd rather they slightly reduce their portion sizes and also reduce their prices accordingly - Servers, while very nice, aren't the most attentive.

I usually like to leave general reviews without getting into the specifics of the dish I had as everyone is different and I feel it is pointless to describe exact things I had.  But wow, the fire roasted artichokes were NASTY.  Negative stars.  Everyone at the table were like ""eww, good luck with that..""  I took a bite and chewed...and chewed...and chewed...and chewed...looked for a napkin (nah better not in front of my co workers)..and chewed..and could not swallow and eventually it felt like I had a huge wad of paper in my mouth, you know, like those spitballs you used to shoot (or be hit with) in grade school.  My teeth could not break the artichokes apart so it could travel on down the throat.  In other words, it tasted horrible and was impossible to eat.  Luckily, the waiter, who was kind and patient (one good thing here) switched it out for a spinach dip after I complained.  Moroccan chicken - look, been there, there was nothing Moroccan about it.  It was good, but not like anything I had there.  I think this place needs to scale back big time and have more of a focus as far as entrees and appetizers are concerned.  I think this is a very standard American eating experience with some attempts to go ethnic.  Stick to some kind of theme though is my advice and shorten the menu.  Too many items make it impossible to do any one dish really well and increase wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=180
Michael T.,"Honolulu, HI",32,25,,4.0,8/23/2011,"This restaurant rocks . . . literally. I had lunch at this beautifully appointed restaurant during the 5.8 earthquake that originated in Virginia but shook the Washington D.C. area, along with some 20 other states and eastern Canada. The light fixtures swayed, the floors rumbled, and a few laminated menus flopped to the floor. While workers in the adjacent office building evacuated, the employees at the Cheesecake Factory remained calm, flipped the television to a news channel, and reported the news to all those who cared and were within earshot. At first, I thought the underground Metro had rumbled to a rough stop several feet below, but I soon realized I was experiencing a rare, and hopefully once in a lifetime, event -- a jolting earthquake in our nation's capital. Wow! By the way, the food was excellent despite the geological sideshow. The server brought two kinds of bread -- three or four slices of a soft baguette, and an equal number of a dark, perhaps molasses bread.  I then had the lunch set -- a chicken and apple salad sandwich, the house tossed salad (expertly dressed with, not drowned in, vinaigrette), and the soup of the day, a rich mushroom cream soup. This was a perfect lunch for an eventful afternoon.  While the chicken salad was not the best I've had, the bread was toasted just right, and the sandwich was cut into neat geometric shapes that enhanced my dining experience. Visual appeal is so important to me. I had a cold bottle of Redbridge beer, a gluten-free, sorghum brew by Anheuser-Busch. Very different; smooth and clean-tasting. Uncharacteristically, I skipped dessert -- duh, no cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory? -- probably in my subconscious haste to leave the restaurant before an aftershock. This restaurant, like others in the chain, is dependably excellent.  This particular location, however, is the only one I've been to that literally rocks.  For that reason, it probably will remain my favorite Cheesecake Factory in the country!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=200

So I went with a chicken caesar salad; impossible to screw up, right? WRONG. The lettuce sometimes tasted like artichokes, the dressing was inexplicably spicy, the parmesan cheese tasted like it came out of a bag and the chicken was dry and cold. I've had better salads at McDonald's. But hey, the cheesecake couldn't be bad, right? I looked at an overwhelming list and settled on white chocolate raspberry. It was SO sweet. SO ... insanely ... sweet. I couldn't even finish it, despite the fact that I had only eaten a third of my salad. Also, the server was pretty standoffish.

They flew all the way from Europe to see me and I took them to Cheesecake Factory because I thought it'd be nice, but the evening was just more trouble than it was worth.  My dad ordered a beer and the glass was broken, so he accidentally cut his mouth on it.  We're not high maintenance patrons; we just asked that the waitress take it away and probably throw away the glass so nobody else has that experience.  The waitress was appropriately apologetic about it, but the manager came over.  I thought she was going to apologize or offer us a free beer or a coupon or something to compensate for the bad experience.  But instead she overbearingly asked us, ""Is there a problem??"" And we simply explained the situation- not that we should have had to.  We really just wanted to be left alone so we could eat our food.  They brought my dad another beer, but accidentally charged us for three beers.  Not only did it take us fifteen minutes to convince the waitress that my dad was only brought two, (although he did technically only drink one because the first one cut his lip) but it would have been more impressive if they had said ""You know what? The beer's on us.""  I was just all around very disappointed.   once I went there just to get avocado egg rolls to go, and there were more sun dried tomatoes than avocados, so the egg rolls were tart and overwhelming.  They're overpriced, but they're so good I normally don't mind.  Now I'm hesitant to splurge on them again. The food is great, but I mean, it's a chain so I can't really credit this place with that. Overall it's just a sloppy establishment. The music is too loud and the service is unprofessional. Part of Cheesecake Factory's charm is that the waiters are supposed to be elite.  These waiters all look dishevled, I mean they might as well be working at McDonald's.  I live in the neighborhood and I'd go here way more often if I were more impressed by it.   But it's just supremely disappointing.  The experience feels cheap.  It's a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=200

I was there with two moms with strollers and the place was empty and we were treated very poorly. After being sat by the hostess in an area that was empty so that we could have our strollers without bothering people, the manager came over to us and told us our strollers were blocking the walkway (which they weren't) and that it was fire hazard.  He wanted me to move the stroller, but my baby was sleeping in it and the hostess knew we had strollers when she seated us. I moved the stroller out of the way (even more) and for the rest of our time there we received dirty and unwelcoming looks from the manager and the waiter (who wasn't even our waiter). Another patron was there with her stroller and the manager did not bother her. In retrospect, I believe we were harassed because we only ordered coffee and drinks and did not order a meal at 4pm (the place was empty and isn't any service better than no service?). I guess we can test that now because I don't plan on returning and neither do my friends. We also will be sure to put the word out that this location is not mom and kid friendly!

From the HUGE sodas to the ""lunch size"" salad that is big enough for two and the ""small plates"" that are just large appetizers served on a small plate.   If you are trying to diet, this isn't the place for you.  I've eaten three separate meals in Paris that don't equal one dish from this place. All that being said, is this place a mecca for foodies around the world?  God no.  But its sort of a guilty pleasure and has big salads, one of the few places to get a good big salad (cue the Seinfeld reference).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=220

Their featured chocolate cake peanut butter sort of cheesecake was perfect.  The downside: the service. It was REALLY hard to get our server's attention. Even after coming to our table, she said that she would be right back, so we couldn't order yet. We eventually had to flag down other servers to get things for us. I would say it was an understaffing issue, but the other servers had enough free time to text for awhile. Not sure what the problem was here, it might've just been an off-night.

I'm so hungry I could eat a brick, I don't want to go tour some dumb factory and learn how cheesecakes are made!  Sigh. I'm not kidding, either. I really did think that.

What's the deal, really? What's so special that I should wait 45 minutes to sit down?  Why does it take 6 years to get served? Oh, probably because Leon Uris wrote the menu, and the cooks have to thumb through a 24 book index just to find the recipe.  The service is highly variable. I've had excellent, attentive waiters, and waiters who made me want to just go into the kitchen and do it myself. Sorry I'm ruining your life asking for water. I know that you're really put upon and all, in your little white uniform. If I am here, I order the thai lettuce wraps.  They're an appetizer, but a meal in themselves.  They are good...just not worth the hoo haa you have to go through to get them.  The roasted artichoke is definitely palatable.  And the cheesecake, of course, is fabulous.  But if I want cheesecake, I go to the bakery and order it.  I don't get a little buzzy thing, drink three over priced martinis, tap my fingers on the bar, tell the lechy old man next to me no twice, and finally get seated just for a piece of effing cake.  Ok so I did that once but I learned my lesson.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=220

The manager came back out and explained to me that the chicken is marinated over night and was cooked at 185 degrees and how it was in fact all the way done. I, however, still have to disagree. Maybe the piece that I tried didn't cook all the way. By this time i had been in the restaurant for over an hour so I just decided to get cheesecake to go.

For a place that makes whipped cream on the spot for their cheesecakes, I was surprised that this whipped cream on their hot chocolate was not up to par. [The Food] We had the calamari (decent), edamame(good), spicy ahi tempura rolls (really pretty good that I order time and time again), pork chops (rubbery and the potatoes were too salty), and the stuffed chicken tortillas (Ro's favorite).  The service was great and kindly brought out mashed potatoes that were much better than the salty ones we first received. We finished it off with a carrot cake cheesecake.  I'm not a fan of carrot cake so I did not enjoy this cake as much as Ro did.

Neither our drinks or our appetizers arrived together, what gives?  The server brings my son a refill of his soda and he sets it down very hard on the table.  My husband's appetizer finally arrives. We are finishing our appetizers, when the server comes back to ""confirm"" our entree order.  He basically takes our order again and informs us that the steaks will take about 25 minutes to cook.  Why was that neccesary to tell us how long it would take to cook our food?  I have never had a server tell me that before.  Our entrees arrive about 30 minutes later.  A table seated about 10 minutes after we arrived have already received their entrees.  Our entress are okay.  Nothing all that special.  This is not characteristic of my experience of The Cheesecake Factory. Specifically, my shrimp scampi was dry, there was very little sauce on the plate and the garlic cloves which are usualy plentiful are few and far between.  As our dinner draws to a close, our server begins to become very gregarious and helpful.  When we ask for boxes, he responds, ""my pleasure.""  He offers to validate my parking ticket and hands it back to me with a ""my pleasure.""  Obviously, this is his push for a great tip.  Our bill is $117.  I leave a $5 tip.  I ask to speak to the manager to explain the low tip.  He listens and apologizes for our experience.  it will be a very long time before I see the inside of this chain restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=240

I've been frequenting the Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember, and its been a staple for our family's birthday parties and other celebrations. The menu is VAST and accommodating, the servers are quirky and energetic (service is awesome- just be sure not to eat too much of the free bread they put out), and the portions are HUGE and reasonably priced. The only regret you'll have after you finish your meal is the fact that you might just have committed calorie seppuku.  As far as specific recommendations for food; Thai lettuce wraps are always a great appetizer, as are the Nachos and Popcorn Shrimp. For main entrees, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and Chicken Fettuccine are long time favorites. They also have great, well cooked pizzas and decent sandwiches. The Frozen Iced Mango and the Pina Coladas are amazing if you're looking for a refreshing drink, and the Red Velvet Cheesecake hits the spot when you're in the mood for dessert. I've been hearing a lot about their Strawberry shortcake, so I'll be sure to try that on my next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=260

I was mainly a fan of their chopped salad and the brunch menu.  Then I had a disturbing experience there last spring.   Their Santa Fe Salad arrived in the usual obscene portion size the restaurant's known for, and tasted pretty much as it had the last time I ate it.  This time, though, I actually got down to the bottom of the bowl because I was sharing it with a friend.   Horrifyingly, under all the lettuce and garnish I found what looked to be the remnants of a pasta dish, specifically, spaghetti.  Mind you, there is no pasta in the Santa Fe Salad.   My conclusion?   Either the kitchen isn't washing the dishes, or the kitchen is scraping the remnants of other patrons' dishes into new orders.   All possibilities are disgusting.   And no, I didn't report it to the server or management.

HA!   Not likely.)  That said, there are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better -- but I thoroughly enjoy the CF for a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good. Now, I will caveat this with a wish that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best.  So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have both gone by the wayside, and it's a complete travesty.  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed... Don't go to any CFs for a nice quiet meal unless you can get outside seating or go in the narrow window between lunch and dinner.  Otherwise any one I've been to is a study in controlled chaos, noisewise.  The most romantic meal will leave you hoarse from yelling to each other by the end of the night.  If you know what you're getting into though, it's all part of the enjoyable charm!  (Really!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=260

From My Experience: Eggplant Sandwich?  Yuck. Appetizer Potstickers?  Eh.  Go and get some real Chinese. Fish & Chips?  Made me sick. Burger?  Well, chains seem to have a way of hitting this one on the head.  But it's fricken huge. Pasta?  Far too decadent and laden with butter, sauce and cheese (like just about everything else here) but people seem to love it. Chicken Salad Sandwich?  OK, but too much goddamn mayo. Fish Tacos? No no no. Just bad. HERB-CRUSTED SALMON SALAD? Fantastic. I'd say you're safe with just about any of the salads, but get the cheese and dressing and all that heavy stuff on the side, because it's the CF way to pile it on.  Overwhelmingly so.  Regardless, my stars are for the page of superior combos they've created for the lover of the dinner salad, even if they need a little tweaking. Just a few final things-- The bread isn't great ( I had to say it- I like bread).  Of course, everything is overpriced.  Go there on a weeknight so you don't have to wait for hours for a table... and then for your food.  DESSERT, I dare say, is literally too good... at least for people like myself with a wicked sweet tooth.   So yeah.  CF in one word?  Dangerous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=260

Even the salad was small (A form of a Cobb salad) To say the least I left hungry. Then, since we do not have a CCF in SC. I wanted to take some home to share with family.I wanted about 13 slices that's equivalent to a whole Cheesecake. I was told if I bough a whole cake I would be charged 48.95 but If I got the same amount of slices but different kinds I would have to pay 119.00 and some change. I would not be able to digest that kind of cheesecake. It is  not that good that I would pay that much, that fattening and calorie loaded, but not so good I would pay 119.00 for the same cake, just different flavors, all the slices cost the same, weight the same, and same number of slices per box.

Personally, I don't know why you'd want to take out their entrees which while being ok, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area with better tasting quality (and WAY healthier) for the same price.  I don't the point of giving you a lot of something when less would mean better quality. Cheesecakes here are yummy of course but they don't give you extra whipped cream like I've gotten at other location when I've asked.  The girl just looked at me funny when I asked and said there's whipped cream already on it.  I haven't tried the 7 inch cake that I bought yet as it takes about 2 hours to defrost (which for some reason I hadn't realized was going to come frozen in the first place).  The cake also comes wrapped in plastic which is then placed into the box.  Will update review after I've tried it tonight. ***UPDATED*** The cheese cake is fabulous but the crust sticks to the bottom and the sides of the holder.  Other than that, the slices are smaller than the giant slices you guy but are still yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=260

I had luck with the herb-crusted salmon salad.  I asked for dressing on the side, and was presented with an enormous bowl of salad greens ringed with some tomato slices, endives, and steamed asparagus.  In the center was a generous, but not grotesque, piece of nicely cooked cold salmon.  Plenty of veggie fiber + a little protein and healthy fats = ahhhh. I didn't think ""digestive happiness"" and ""Cheesecake Factory"" could be in the same sentence, but apparently it's possible.  That being said, it was pretty damn overpriced and not really anything special.  The only reason I liked it so much is that it was exactly what I was craving.

Now to dessert:  mil ordered the tiramisu.  She loved it.  It seemed a bit loaded down with whipped cream but looked tasty.

I went on a Saturday evening and the service sucked.  We ordered an appetizer (fried mac and cheese balls - judge me), two salads, and a glass of wine.  The wine took about 15 minutes to get to our table, but no biggie since we weren't in a rush.  Not too much later, our food came out.  Our server plopped our salads in front of us and took off while another server put down a plate of fried cheese slices - not what we ordered.  We told him (not our server) this and he took them back.  Over ten minutes later, we still hadn't received them (yes, our appetizer) and our waiter had not stopped by once to check in with us.  At this point, I walked up to the manager.  Not so much to tattle-tale on the server, but really, the server may not have even known about our problem since we told another server our problem after he had ran off.  The manager seemed really accommodating and said she would get back to me.  She came to our table about 5 minutes later and said ""Sorry, there was a mix-up with your drink downstairs, but that should be coming up soon.  And as for your crab cake appetizers, that should be here soon too.""  I corrected her and told her we weren't waiting for a drink and we ordered mac and cheese balls, not crab cakes. Again she left and again she returned apologizing.  She explained that the balls had been delivered to the wrong table (next to us, those lucky bastards) so they are now making new ones for us which should be up soon and she also said she would comp us for the balls.   So we eventually get our balls (mini heart attacks with a side of cream sauce), get a few bites of cheesecake, and ask for the check.  The check comes with both the mac and cheese balls on the receipt and the fried cheese appetizer (that we never ordered but had been brought to our table which we did not accept) with the fried cheese appetizer comped.  Another five minutes go by before our server comes by, and we explain this to him.  He says ""yea, you didnt order those, so i comped you for it"".  Thanks, buddy, now go comp what we were supposed to be comped for.  Eventually, he got it right, but it was just another hurdle that resulted in delays in the evening.

I have a habit of ordering the same thing every time I go, however, I do tend to munch off the plates of friends and family and with the exception of one time, everything was good.  I recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, it is a bit spicy and they cut down on the chicken portion, but it is good to the very last drop and tastes good the next day when you heat it up in the microwave. The Chicken Madeira and Kobe burgers are good choices as well. As far as drinks, I recommend their Mai Tai's and any flavor Bellini. The desserts are all good, but my favs are the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake, Vanilla Bean and Banana Cream Cheesecake.  As for parking, I'm not a fan of that absurd garage below the restaurant. I usually get lucky with parking near the townhouses behind the building or parking by the Lord and Taylor or Mazza Gallerie lot, it just seems easier, not the mention the validation for the garage under Cheesecake hardly offers a discount.  Unfortunately Cheesecake Factory isn't open for reservations which is crazy because it's such a popular place to eat, so if your party is more than 4, you will have a rather long wait during prime time.

Laurie B.,"Washington, DC",0,18,,5.0,6/5/2012,"the cheesecake factory is one of my all time favorite retaurants, and the one on wisconsin in friendship heights make the experience even more pleasurable. the staff is very polite and always makes sure to come check that the meal is going well. every time its so hard for me to pick which cheesecake to get, as i love the dulce de leche so much--i usually end up getting two and taking home the leftovers, which by the way are still just as good the next day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=280
Alycia E.,"Washington, DC",13,93,,3.0,9/23/2008,"It seems somewhat pointless to review a restaurant with the word ""factory"" in its name. We all know that C.F. is about huge portions of ""meh"" food, but what it IS good for is finally getting consensus from a large group of people just looking to agree on a place to meet and eat. Large menu, decent drink menu, and the Friendship Heights Metro right underneath -- it really is a good place to suggest when you have one or two people in your group who aren't food explorers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=280

Alexandra S.,"Washington, DC",55,293,139,4.0,4/18/2011,"Just like all the other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, this one can get crazy busy.  We happened to eat here on a week night and somewhat on the late side so it wasn't too bad at all. In fact, we just went straight in and sat at the bar.  The waitress was very nice and we ended up not waiting long at all till we got our food. I not only love the diversity of the menu but consistently find the quality to get great as well. And yet I still managed to be pleasantly surprised when I ordered the mediterranean fish. It was sooo good. Cooked perfectly and the spices/tomatoes etc on top were excellent.  I had planned to only eat 1/2, given their portion sizes, but ended up cleaning my plate!  My friend ordered the cuban sandwich and holly cow was that good too! yumm yum. We even splurged and shared a slice of the plain low-cal cheesecake and it was delicious too. Not only a lovely evening but a great dinner. Excellent combo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=280
Glen L.,"Albuquerque, NM",41,91,1,5.0,8/16/2006,I can't believe the other reviews were so negative.  Ya gotta love The Cheesecake Factory.  The portions really make you feel like white trash.  It's damn good though.  I highly recommend the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake.  It is the BEST.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=280
Alat B.,"Washington, DC",0,5,,4.0,8/1/2011,I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory.  My first exposure to the Cheesecake Factory was in Boston where I used to go repeatedly.  I came to this one for the first time over the weekend and relived the same amazing experience.  The variety at Cheesecake Factory is unparelled and the food is always amazing.  I definately recommend this place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=280
Petra S.,"San Francisco, CA",552,1120,519,2.0,1/25/2006,"I've only been to the SF location but I've found that the wait just isn't worth it. If your going for say a special event and not being able to reserve is just a big downer and a waist of what would have been a great event. The cheesecakes there are tasty but again go for either dessert OR a meal cuz the cheescake is so big and filling in itself you wont have room to enjoy it or it's ""price"" if you don't have an empty stomach. And if your watching your weight it's a little too unforgiving to eat there too often, and with thier entries their just not that tasty unless your getting thier ""luau Salad"" which is a hawaiian/asian salad that is both sweet and savery and very filling even if you only get a half portion which i recommend. I once had thier pesto pizza and remember having a terrible stomach ache afterwards which left me in bed pretty much for the rest of the day. Dunno what was up with that. Other than that this is a highly over rated place to go for a birthday or with your friends since the wait can kill your patience when your STARVING.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=280
Veronique B.,"Bethesda, MD",0,39,1,5.0,5/31/2013,"I have to say I am the first one surprised at how great this place is especially considering the location where it's apparently competing with a ton of restaurants... HA! I tried almost all of them since I just moved to the neighborhood and am getting such a kick of being able to walk to diner... Chain restaurants are really not high on my list, so I went there really because it was there and so was I.... well I just about fell off my chair. Service is one of the best I've had in this country (and they don't sweep right next to you as you are eating!!!) from the hostesses to the servers they should all get accolades (I wish I could remember names but you can't go wrong with anyone! Special mention and kudos to TCF for hiring OLDER servers wow there's a change!) and the food is typical US chain but GOOD... they try original and they pull it off too! I was delighted with the quality and the quantity can be highlighted as pre-recession!!! Result is I keep going back again and again (secretly wishing they disappoint! lol) because of the whole experience at a great price.... all I can say is KEEP IT UP!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=300

Leigh S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",55,21,2,2.0,6/15/2009,"While I have been to Cheesecake at both White Flint and Friendship Heights  many many times, I just had to write about my most recent trip to the FH location... Our service was so preposterous, I don't think I can go back to the location - not for lack of service, but for the most intrusive service I have ever received! As a server of 8 years myself, I can be pretty forgiving, but he was so invasive we could not enjoy our meal.  While it is aggravating to sit and wait for service, or have your waiter disappear on you, it is equally annoying to have a server that clearly cannot read his customers and interrupts the table *every* time he passes by (which was frequent since our table was right next to the Micros where he put in orders). After checking back after every single time something was dropped at the table (is the bread ok?, drinks, apps, a napkin, more butter, a refill, another refill, an extra fork - are these all ok?), I was getting annoyed. At one point, I was cutting off a shrimp tail and he stopped to ask me if something was wrong with my shrimp.  Can a girl cut her food without an inquisition?  My breaking point was when he came to get us refills (my pet peeve is when people take my glass and reuse it, but I digress) and he took my glass with a sugar coated rim and PUT IT IN HIS ARMPIT to carry back to the station to refill it with lemonade.  Sorry, but that's unsanitary and completely disgusting. I may be done with Cheesecake (at least the location) for good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-washington?start=300
