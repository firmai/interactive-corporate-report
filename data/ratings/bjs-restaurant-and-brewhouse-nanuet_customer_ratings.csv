67,Orlando A.,"Hazleton, PA",0,10,6.0,4.0,2015-02-03,"I give 4 starts because the restaurant looks great ! The food was excellent, I went during the pre opening and I was impressed by the food.. I had the pork chops with mash potatoes and a tortilla soup. -- the pork was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The mash potatoes was one of the best I had as well as the soup. I like how they pour the soup in front of you from a stainless steel cup.  My second guest had a flat bread which was great. Perfectly crispy and had great taste.  My third guest had burger sliders which were well done -- had good taste and had the fixings on the side so you could build it the way you like --- the desert which we shared was some kind of pecan which ice cream on top served in a skillet. We finished that in no time, fighting over pieces.  Now for the bad -- service really needs help. I understand it's a new place but the service was horrible. Staff knew almost nothing that was going on, what was on the menu. The person helping the trainee was excellent he said he comes from a bj's in Columbus Ohio. Need more staff like him. A young lady in guessing was the manager was going table to table. Came to our table and didn't ask how our meal or food was but asked ""is all you good"" (the look on everyone face at my table was priceless) -- not what a manager should be asking. She should have ask very specifically about our experience and/or the food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-nanuet?start=60,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576

However she forgot our appetizer and immediately brought our main dishes. Those were taken back, the appetizer appeared and again, 10 minutes later they brought out the main dishes. Half our apps still in front of our faces. The manager came over soon thereafter and stated "" We opened only 2 days ago. Maybe on the third we'll get things right."" (I'm giggling right now thinking of how ridiculous a statement that was.) There was one redeeming factor though....Tuesday nights wine is half price.

159,Jennifer H.,"Nanuet, NY",0,7,,1.0,2015-02-15,"I think they rushed to open and the staff is far from ready.  We did the call ahead reservations only to show up and see a mob in the entry way.  The call ahead system crashed so everyone was ready to riot.  We waited about 30 minutes for our table.  Our waiter was friendly but not very knowledgeable.  It took 10 minutes for drinks.  Another 15 to get our beers and place our appetizer order.  Appetizers were ok.  Meals came but they forgot my husbands salad.  When we ordered a second round of beers it took another 15 minutes, only to find out they ran out of the beer I ordered, so I waited another 10 for that.  Dinners were ok.. sounded better on paper.  We ordered 2 desserts.  My daughters came in a reasonable time.  We waited 25 minutes for the waiter to tell my husband that there was a problem with his.. and then another 10-15 minutes for the manager to come out and basically say we were out of luck.  I will not be returning anytime soon.

It was probably a parking issue more than anything else. The girl at the back door was a little troubled that I had come in the ""pickup"" door but did walk me to the front desk where an enthusiastic young lady said sit anywhere you would like. Nice. This is where it starts to go wrong and I start looking for my phone to read how this place has been doing. You know when you have been sitting there waiting so long  that you start thinking about walking out. Thats how long. Its like a quest now. 10 employees of all kinds are walking by. Not a word. Now I have been here a full 20 minutes, no drink, no meeting of the ""server"".    Finally a young girl says hello, I am staring at the TV running some old football show so long that she startled me. She inquiries if this was my first trip to BJs. I indicated it was She goes into a memorized beer pitch, which just by my body language alone she realized that it was time to get down to brass tacks. I ordered food and drink, which came very quickly, was good and fresh. I have never heard of a BJs brewhouse before coming here but I am sure there is a GREAT one somewhere. So great in fact that some smart guy desided to copy it in Nanuet NY. The only problem is that there is no culture of employee here. I am sure at some point they will figure it out, or this place will be gone.

215,Molly M.,"New City, NY",37,21,1.0,2.0,2015-02-27,"BJ's Brewhouse in Nanuet opened February 3rd 2015. I went for the 1st time February 27th and by my observation they are still in a learning phase which is unacceptable for a restaurant that is a chain. Being in Food Srv Mgnt front and back of house for many years and have been 1st hand a at openings, I know the extensive training that is required for all staff to be universally skilled and knowledgeable w/ all of the menu items as well as drinks We arrived at 6 PM on a Friday and it had a moderate amount of guests already seated. However, the hostess could not take anyone's names because she could not access how long the wait time was without a manager's assistance. There was a line of people who were already there and people who had just arrived. This created a bit of havoc as to who was next to give their names.  When my fiance went to the bar to order a Sauvingon Blanc which is on their menu the bartender went to look at their beers and then was told its a wine not a beer and his reply was, ""We don't have that"" I went to tell the manager that the bartender has no idea what Sauvignon Blanc or that you even sell it and all I was told was ""Oh okay""  I feel a managers' job is to remedy a situation at least with an apology and that he would take care of this. This lack of apathy in management is not encouraging.  My fiance then asked if he could make a Chocolate Martini ( which is not on  menu) but not a difficult drink to make if you are a bartender in a bigger, trendier place. His response was, ""I could but we ran out of Godiva""  This is ineffective ordering of on a Friday at 6 PM when you run out of a liquor that might not have been able to make my drink but it also will not make any other drink on their menu either.  Our waiter was sincere, welcoming and friendly. I ordered a chocolate raspberry beer which i pointed to on the menu, and my fiance ordered the Sauvignon Blanc. The waiter came back moments later and asked me to show him where the beer was on the menu. I asked the server if he was with them from the beginning and he said yes. I asked if they trained him on the menu and his answer was, "" There are so many items my head is ready to blow up"" The drinks took about 10-15 mins to arrive. When the drinks did arrive my fiance was give a red wine. This mishap was corrected. But waiting that long and seeing only 3 bartenders for the size of the place is an accident waiting to happen in terms of wait time and errors.  I ordered the fish taco's with tomato salsa and an avocado cream sauces on the side accompanied by fresh and crispy tortilla chips. Very tasty and presented well on the plate. My fiance ordered the rack of baby back ribs, mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The meat was falling off the bone and the sweet BBQ sauce tasted delicious and house made. The potato's were dry and the Brussel sprouts were very small and overcooked. Over all I feel whatever regional manager they sent to prepare, train and motivate the staff should be retrained himself.  A restaurant which is a chain has a reputation to uphold in management, training, and that manager should not leave until he is assured that the staff is up to par.  BJ's Resturant and Brewhouse you clearly are not ready to serve anyone.  Please pass this place up when choosing to go out to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-nanuet?start=140,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

The bread it was served on was great, and added a nice crispy buttery aspect to the burger. They brew their own beer but I was not so impressed with.

Simple design to the restaurant.  TV's everywhere.  But if you're going to use kegs of beer as part of the decor, you'd think that you would at least clean them. Hostesses seemed like they didn't want to be there and had no personality at the front desk or while walking to the table.  Not sure if is something they were told to do, or do it on their own, but the hostesses walk to the table at an uncomfortably slow pace.  Watched them do this with many tables. Waitress seemed pleasant enough.  Way too much jewelry on to be waiting on tables.  Menu knowledge needs some work as she needed my wife to hold up the menu while she read the description to see if the kids meal came with a side item. Place was full, but not crazy.   25 minutes from ordering to food hitting the table. Ordered two basic burgers.  One medium, one medium well.  Food runner came out, and when I asked which one was medium, she smiled and said 'they're both medium well'  with a smile, dropped them, and left without questioning the mistake.  Burgers were much more suited for a drunken 1am binge...heavy and greasy...buns were grilled in butter... California club was tasty, but became unappealing upon a short curly hair on the plate...obviously not my wife's or mine. Kids pan pizza obviously a reheated boboli like pizza.  My daughter didn't touch it. Consolidated some food on a plate to bring it home.  Waitress said that she would bring us a box because they 'are not allowed to box things up"" for us.  What?  That made no sense. Their own brand of IPA was relatively flavorless.  Overall tap beer list was very generic.  With Growler and Gill right down the road, there is no reason to go there for a beer. Wine glass for wife's drink was never polished from the night before.

170,Mike A.,"Nanuet, NY",14,50,,2.0,2015-04-29,"I ate here last night in a party of 7 for a birthday celebration. In short, the service is poor, the food is typical mediocre quality chain restaurant food, the beer is good. I made a reservation the day before. This is the first time I've called a restaurant and got a prompt with several menu items. You can't just call the restaurant and get the hostess. You have to listen to a menu prompt. To reserve a party of 7 or more you have to wait for option #5 or 6. Then after selecting the correct option you get what sounds like the hostess anyway. But only the manager can make a reservation of 7 or more. Already I'm annoyed because there is a phone menu prompt that doesnt even bring you to the correct person. I wait on the phone for 10 minutes for the manager and spend another 10 minutes with him to make the reservation and confirm the details, full name and phone number. I'm told if I'm not there within 15 minutes of the reservation we lose our table. I would say thats common knowledge when making a reservation and thats fine but I've never been lectured before. I havent even gotten to the restaurant yet and I'm already annoyed from spending 20+ minutes on the phone to make a simple reservation. Last night, Tuesday at 7pm, the 7 of us arrive at the restaurant. The hostess and manager can't find my reservation. After spending all that time on the phone the day before they don't have my info in the system. Now I'm annoyed because we have to wait to be seated, maybe 10-15 minutes. Luckily it was a Tuesday and not overly crowded. The hostess who lead us to our table seemed to really not want to be there. She half assed reach for a menu and drops it in front of us. My girlfriend hands it to her and she grabs it and keeps walking. She may of said thanks but it wasnt heard by either of us. She leads us to our table and immediately walks away. She doesn't tell us who our waiter/waitress will be or tell us to enjoy our meal. Just walks away before the rest of the party even gets to the table.  Our waiter, Mike, was great. He asked us if we dined there before. When we said no he explained the beers and food. He gave us recommendations based on the typical beers we drink. BJ's makes 10 beers they have on their menu full time and had 1 seasonal beer there. I had a sampler of 4 which was plenty of beer for 1 person. All the beers were great and the highlight of the meal. The food was ok. Its in line with Chilis and Olive Garden. Just cheap food to fill you up. Nothing to write home about. I had the thin crust pizza. Others had burgers, salmon, pulled pork and other items. No one really liked their meal but no one hated it. One person's meal had an issue and didn't come out with everyone else. That person had to wait 10 minutes for them to cook him a new dish. Not sure what the issue was but our waiter was very apologetic and very helpful throughout the whole meal. After dinner was finished we walked out with the hostess and manager standing in the front. The manager said good night and that was it.  The manager knew we had an issue with the reservation and hopefully would know if a table was missing a dish. For a place that makes their own beer I would have expected a visit from the manager after we seated and offer to buy the birthday person a free beer. Of if they are too cheap to offer a free beer atleast come over and say sorry and check up on us.   Just a random side note. The line cooks wear baseball caps instead of hair nets. I didnt see any hair nets showing under the caps. It just seemed odd and worth pointing out. After reading one reviewer stating they had hair in their food and seeing the baseball caps I spent a minute to comb through my pizza before I ate it.  To compare similar restaurants, Yard House in the Palisades mall is an awesome restaurant. I ate there several months ago for a birthday celebration, and a few times before that. The whole experience was great (service and food were both really good) and the manager gave the birthday girl a free yard of beer.  Customer service really does go a long way. Even with the mediocre food at BJ's if the manager and staff were more professional this would have been a more positive review and they would have had a return customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-nanuet?start=200,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.6320000000000006,3.2000000000000006

Overall the food was good but not incredibly inspired.  I had one of their fun drinks: it was some sort of Jack Daniel's blueberry lemonade concoction. It was good. Right amount of alcohol. I had the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli as an appetizer. They were ok except for the fact that they were a little mushy/underdone in the very middle. There could have been a little more aioli.  The mister had the Fritos Nachos. Again, good, but not out of this world. The chili was average and I like how it was served in a deep dish casserole thing. Cute.  For my entree I had the French Dip sandwich. It was very good and the portion was generous enough without being obnoxiously huge. It came with skinny fries and they were really good. I'm a French fry aficionado so I judge. These passed muster.  My man had the watermelon feta salad. He liked it although he later regretted getting something so light because he was hungry. I was full from my meal so he had the second half of my sandwich. My munchkin had the cheese pizza from the kids' menu and she ate most of it so I'll say it was good.

I came in and asked the receptionist how long the wait was, after asking how many of us and do we need high chairs (yes), she responds 15 minutes. After 25 minutes, kids starting to get antsy, I go back in and she explains that we were specifically waiting for a table to accommodate the high chairs. I told her I didn't know that, I will take a booth if it expedites the process. She said we will sit next. Fine. After 5 minutes I see an outside sitting open up, I go back in and tell her we WANT that table, potentially screaming kids away from a crowd, sound like a sweet deal. She said she'll get it cleaned. Long story short, she forgets to mention its self seating, had I known this I would've guarded that table like a hawk...of course we lose it to another customer. I go in to complain, by this time it's already been 40 minutes of total waiting, spoke to a manager, who did really nothing but smirk and say I'm sorry. End of story, we sat smack in the middle of the dining room after 40 minutes of waiting, waited for our food another 20-30 minutes, even though we ordered right when we sat. You would think, they would at least get the kids food out asap. By the time the food comes out, kids are freaking out since they see food - but guess what, no utensils on the table.

What a HUGE MISTAKE. I called in early to let them know I'd pick it up  between 7:30 and 8:00pm. I wasn't able to pick it up till 8:45.. I called them to let them know I was coming. By the time I got there it was still in the oven and the waitress helping me said it would only take 10 mins. I waited for 30 mins... apparently, they threw out the cake they originally made bc it had been sitting out for a while. I'm not sure I fully believe that and I wouldn't have minded a not hot out of the oven cookie cake. I can understand why they would do that for regular food , but not a baked cookie cake. The wait was horrible! By the time we reached where we were supposed to eat dinner, most of the people had finished eating already. What was WORSE was how the large pizookie cake turned out. It wasn't cooked all the way through.  Some parts were really salty, but most of it was way too sweet. It was inedible. I'd probably need insulin just to be able to get through one piece and come out alive. It was a disaster!!!No one even wanted to eat it, including me.

The food WAS good enough to get them back to two stars, but this ""okay, I'll give them one more chance"" trip proved even the food is not consistant. Service was lazy, uneducated, wrong, haphazard, slow, surly, and ultimately ineffective. This is a BEER place, and you have to ask if something advertised at the front door on a giant poster is still on tap??   And when you ""go check"",  you forget my companions order?  And then when you finally get the beer that I wanted, you forget my companion's order AGAIN? ""Crispy Calamari"" wasn't even half right.  Terribly under cooked, soggy, greasy and disgusting, I can assume it actually squid... but the texture suggested oily dishrags. The Ahi Poke appetizer was tasty, but a miniscule quantity for such little tuna that was barely sushi grade. Her steak was okay, but the brussel sprouts were overcooked and dead. My New Orleans jambalaya was greasy with overdone andoulie sausage. But the CARDINAL sin (in my eyes) was the 35 minute wait for a beer.  I was about to pull a ""Gina""  [that's when you call the establishment, from your table, politely ask for the manager on duty, and then politely ask for somebody to service your table]  but miss attitude finally stopped by (I already asked for another beer from the kitchen carry out guy and a busboy) and my companion says ""Can he get another beer?"" Which should have been a hint.  But no.  It took another 20 minutes with a ""your beer is almost ready""... WTF?  Was it final lagering?  Were they dry-hopping to order??

81,Ashley S.,"Nanuet, NY",217,15,74.0,3.0,2015-09-24,"I enjoy coming here to eat and drink at the bar or outside, but the rest of the restaurant is a mess in my opinion. They have great happy hour specials, occasional special beer dinners, and all of their ""house"" beers are really yummy. All of the food I've tried here has been really delicious. From the honey sriracha brussel sprouts to the brisket bacon burger. My favorite house beer has to be their Nutty Brewnette. The bar area is super nice although there are not many seats. The outdoor area is also really nice but with limited seating.  The wait to eat can be very long but if you download their app you can put your name on the wait list before you even get there. I highly encourage doing so. The bar service has been pretty good each time I went but the food can take a long time to come out.  My biggest complaints are for the lobby service and take out service. Sometimes there is only one person at the front desk and they have to take each group to a table then come back and help the next. This can take a while considering the size of this place and they should have 2 people up there during peak hours. TAKE OUT ANNOYANCE: Today I picked up lunch. I ordered and paid for one of their lunch specials online. It was the half flatbread pizza with a salad for $7.75. I got there on time. The woman at the take out desk hands me the pizza. I said ""Doesn't this come with a salad?"" She had no clue. I had to take out my phone and pull up the confirmation email to prove to her that it does come with a salad. So then I waited about 5 minutes to bring out the very simple salad. She asked me if I wanted dressing even though it's supposed to come with it. Finally I have everything I paid for. Then she begins to tell me what I owe. I tell her that I already paid online. Again, I have to pull up my receipt confirmation email and show her this. She didn't even say anything after I show her so I just ask ""Are we done here?"" and she replies ""Yes"". And I'm out the door. I get home and the pizza is cold so I have to microwave it. GREAT It's safe to say that I'm going to wait a very long time before I even consider ordering for take out here again. The managers here really need to do some more training because some of these employees don't even know their own menu. A simple 2 minute process took about 10 minutes. I'll just stick to eating at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-nanuet?start=80,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0520000000000005,3.0000000000000004

192,Rachel C.,"Schenectady, NY",0,2,,1.0,2016-04-27,"I was going on a date and decided that BJ's would be a great place to meet.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  The hosts were lovely.  Then our waitress (Kaylyn M) came over quickly and asked us if we would like a beverage.  We put our orders in for drinks and then put in order for appetizers and dinner.  When our appetizer arrived (wings), we still did not have napkins or silverware and or waitress quickly left and we did not have time to ask her.  The waitress in the section next to us realized and asked if we needed something and she got us some.  Then, as soon as we got napkins and silverware, our entrees arrived.  So by the time we ate our wings, our entrees were cold.  Our glasses sat empty for our meals.  The waitress never asked how our meals were.  She never cleared the plates, I had to ask twice.  Then after twenty minutes of waiting with the dessert menu from the table open in front of me, the dirty dishes pushed to the end of the table, and the empty glasses put where she could see, she asked if we would like dessert.  Not only did I have to ask for boxes, refills, and the plates cleared, but she managed to drop the check right after she brought the desserts out.  We weren't even near halfway done.  Meanwhile, in all our spare time sitting at our dirty table, we had a lovely view of the kitchen, which contained five staff in which we were able to count eating off the line.  We managed to get a video and pictures. Two staff were eating ribs, one eating french fries and I'm not sure what the other were munching on, looked delicious though.

I dont care for the hugeness but because was a sunday lunch and not crowded at all. Our waitress was very good and attentive and we appreciated how she would bring second round of drinks without asking and that was just fine. She checked on us and was very good with any explanations. The menu weighed about 5 pounds! As for the food - the bacon cheeseburgers were excellent and cooked as requested -was pretty large with plenty of delicious bacon and cheese. The taste was one of the best around. The plate though was overloaded with skinny fries that were all over the place- they were not very tasty but sure were crunch and I stated skinny and long. There was an order of short ribs that 2 split and they it was huge and tasted good and were devoured. The last order was for the shrimp tacos also noted as tasting good but to me looked disappointing as the shrimp were small (makes sense small shrimp- but NOT really) and could have been larger and there were 2. The warm pizookie- a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream deserts were enjoyed by those that got them. But overall the food was very good but the ambiance of the place is like a huge warehouse- its reputation though is for mobbed weekend nights so somethings going well here.

71,Ashley A.,"Westwood, NJ",117,192,440.0,2.0,2016-07-31,"Well, after a few trips to BJ's Brewhouse I've come to the conclusion that although the food is good, service just doesn't match up. My last visit was a disaster. We chose BJ's to kickstart our vacation thinking we'd have a great meal and a fun time. It was anything but that. Our waitress was very condescending to my Fiancée basically telling him to ""shut up"". Here's how it started. We were originally seated by a different waitress. We told her we wanted to pay with the bjs online app and that we were members. She took down the info and put our drink orders in. A little bit later a different waitress returned and said she would be taking over. Since the message wasn't relayed to her that we were going to be paying with the bjs app, we reminded her and she took down the info. We, all three of us places our orders. Nothing complicated. I got the veggie deep dish pizza, fiancé jambalaya and brother baked ziti. About 20 mins later the ziti and jambalaya comes out and she says ""it'll just be a couple of mins sweetie"" to me, and btw I'm like twice her age so sweetie seemed weird to me lol. Anyways, long story short another 20 mins go by and finally she brings out the pizza, but it's got ham all over it so clearly it's not correct. I said that and she's like ""are you sure?"" And checked her pad, I was like ""yes I'm sure, I k ow what I ordered and I don't eat ham"" so, no apologies, just takes the pizza away and says I'll have him make you a new one it'll just take a couple mins. So she comes out like 10 mins later and the pizza is correct but it's ice cold, as if it's been sitting for a while. I just asked her to wrap it up and I'll take it home and microwave it and eat it there. She insists that I should order a new one free of charge cause she wants me to be satisfied. At that point we were all tired and just wanted to go home. It wasn't a good experience so my fiancé said ""no, well just take it home"" and she said to him "" I'm talking to her, can she speak? You enjoyed your food so let her make up her own mind"" I was shocked. At that point I just said ok, make a new one. More to keep the peace and just so she would stop insisting and let us be. My fiancé was so upset. He didn't say a word after that. I felt so bad. He's been in the waitering buisness himself and was appalled at how she acted. So we waited about another 10 min, my fiancé didn't finish his food and when the pizza came out, again it was cold. But I didn't say anything because I just wanted to go. I forced myself to eat one slice ""lost my appetite at that point"" and then asked for it to be wrapped. When we tried to pay online we could see that out order was never applied to the app, and she handed us a check. So , for the third time we explained that we wanted to pay online through the bjs app and she acted as if it was the first time she heard this. In the end she gave us the pizza free and 20% off the bill, but after this experience we have decided we will not be going back. Every time we go there's a blunder, and although we get compensated for it in the end it would be nice to be able to go and just have a drama free experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-nanuet?start=60,3.36,3.43,3.43,3.2720000000000002,3.402

I was pleasantly surprised that the NY location was just as good - if not better!  The restaurant is HUGE and the menu is pages and pages of yummy goodness. Loads of beers on tap, and the homemade cherry soda was amazing!!!  We started with the Sriracha Dry Rub Wings and Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. OMG both were SOOOOO good.

We got the appetizer combo with chicken wings, spinach dip, mozzarella sticks, and avocado spring rolls. Everything was greasy. Spinach dip was obviously microwaved. Chicken wings were more breading than chicken. The menu is super disorganized and has way too much variety yet not enough depth.

The climate is California-trendy, there are multiple screens showing different games, music playing, and its loud and hard to talk. We went on a Saturday night and there was a 45 minute wait. As for the food, it doesn't seem to be as good as the original California BJ's. We had the exact same dishes 6 months ago in Huntington Beach - flatbread margherita pizza, and salmon with quinoa, and both of them were a notch less good in this location. The quinoa was salty and slightly bitter and too wet. The flatbread pizza was kind of bland.

Instead she decided to talk to her co workers and use her cell phone on the floor. Finally we put our order in..  I got the brussel spouts; she brought them out and i noticed a hair in my food. I knew it wasnt mine because it was long and hair and my hair is short and blonde. Then i notice our server had her hair down and not tied back.. i told her about the hair and she insisted it was mine and not hers. When i asked to speak to the manager she told me that the manager had stepped out and wouldnt be back for a while.

We called in advance to place our name on the waitlist (this was the best part of our visit - service wise). We were seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter came over right away to take our drink order, the kids order and I placed an app order (fried calamari). For my kids I ordered spaghetti and rice (yes rice, my daughter has strange eating habits.. don't ask..) and Mac n Cheese with fries for my son. When or drinks arrived we placed our order - pulled pork sandwich for me and some chicken entree for my hubby... here's where the disaster began. Our calamari came out after a good 15 minutes along with my daughter's spaghetti... then the server went back to get her rice and my son's fries... but no mac n cheese.... so my son tried the calamari Bc he was starving and lucky for us liked it. Mean while I kept trying to find my waiter to see what was going on with the Mac n cheese but he was busy and acting frantic but never turned his head to look our way... after a good 8-10 minutes of my kid eating French fries and calamari (which btw was not good... tasted like rubber bands..) finally our waiter was standing at the register when I had to basically scream EXCUSE ME to get his attention. I asked him where's he mac n cheese and his response was ""oh there're probably still working on it..."" wrong answer guy... so he went to the back and came right back out with it... it was sitting there. Not hot, but warm - warm was fine with me Bc he doesn't like it hot. Now our food comes out. I was expecting typical shredded pulled pork... it was chunks of pork with fatty pieces. It was supposed to come topped with frizzled onions but had none but Bc I couldn't find my server I didn't say anything. I didn't enjoy it though I ate it. Now I drank my whole cup of soda and needed a refill. Once again our waiter was no where to be found. Then when he appeared he was on the opposite side of the restaurant staring off into space. I literally waved him down to get a refill. He apologized and told us he had a table of kids that pulled a diner dash... sucks, but get yourself together and serve the rest of your customers who would probably be willing to give you a good tip had you been a good waiter!!! Maybe they didn't pay Bc you suck!! We ordered the kids ice cream sundaes Bc they wanted one and hubs n i split their cookie/brownie trio  dessert. That was very good.

I'm no fan of their pizzas, which is supposively one of their signature highlights.  I focus more on the other aspect, the craft beers.  Both their house brews and craft beers they carry give you draft offerings for every occasion.  Want to take a growler of a house brew home?  They can do that.  They cannot accommodate for the other beers they carry, so be sure to drink your fill. Their award winning ribs are juicy and flavorful for a bar grille, please do not compare to a specialty BBQ place, but they are good.  The ribeye is not to disappoint and the sides can be filling.  Skip the spaghettini and meatball.  The pasta alls well be soup noodles, with a Cheyenne Pepper Tomato Sauce.  The burgers are a decent bite, as well as the salmon offerings. Moving on to dessert, I can hardly resist the Pizookie, particularly the white chocolate macadamian nut version.  Oh, so good, but don't calorie count or you may find it doubled your meal placing inches around your gut. The kids will be glad to know of good in-house wifi, as well as internet provider wifi are also in range.  Kid garlic knots and mixed fruit are offered at no charge.  Complimentary crayons and coloring activity page are part of the service.  A family bathroom is also on site.  The kitchen theater window is a hit with the kids should you request a booth at the rear of the restaurant. Wait times can vary, being 25 min to 40 on the weekend peak dinner times to immediate seating on weekdays.  Oh yes, they are open on many holidays including New Year's Day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-nanuet?start=20,3.92,3.68,3.68,3.152,3.7760000000000002

First time I sat at the bar and had dinner and drinks with my boyfriend. The food was amazing. The beer was good. If you like craft beer check this place out ASAP. The bartender, Jim, was so personable and friendly, but still gave us our privacy to have dinner. Allowed us to experience trying some of the beer before going with something new. I always appreciate a bar-tender that is looking to bring a better experience to guests. The ambiance of this place is upscale rustic. There is outdoor seating too! Heaters, and is open concept indoor outdoor bar in a little part of the patio which is a real cool touch. There are TV's indoor and outdoor, it is a mini brewery after all! Price is moderate with a wide variety of choices on the menu from $5 items to $25 items. Drinks are fairly priced too. I am not a huge fan of chain establishments but BJ's Brew House is not quite a chain and definitely still obtains an authentic feel. The only reason BJ's Brew House earns 4 stars is clear! Great place. It falls short of the 5th start for only two small reasons; so good that you're always busy and there's always a wait, and because the vegan offerings are limited on the menu. I had the Cauliflower tacos and they were DELICIOUS. However, it was one of only about 5 options on the entire menu of 40 plus items. My suggestion to management is to definitely expand on that, or in the menu clearly state for it to be easy option separate meat from vegetarian. The price difference is why offering an actual vegan option is probably easier for everyone. Download the App if you want to get on the line before actually arriving. You shouldn't last minute decide to go here at dinner time if you do not want to wait on a line! However, good things are worth the wait!

I ordered the jalapeño burger which was delicious. I also downloaded the app as instructed by the hostess to receive the free Poozookie dessert it was delicious as well. My friends ordered Salmon and Jambalaya which they enjoyed.

55,Aaron C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",118,13,2.0,4.0,2017-07-04,"Bjs Brewhouse has always been a place that has good food and good vibe.  It is located at the Nanuet shopping complex and has easy access to parking.  The menu consists of various of items.  I love their deep dish pizza.  A small is actually filling for me (6 slices).  The slices are humongous and you can choose a lot of options.  Their ribs are pretty good as well.  The meat easily comes off the bone and it is served with 2 signature sides.  The half rack is $18 and a full rack is $22.  I would recommend always getting the full rack to get your moneys worth.  The sides I usually get are either their fries, rice pilaf, sprussel sprouts and I've recently tried their couscous mac n cheese and it was really good.  It was gooey and filled with tomato, cheese, and bacon. Of course, their desserts is a must have which is their pizookies.  My go to choice is white macadamia nut pizookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  It is always served hot so the ice cream is soft and melts in your mouth.  I'm not a beer drinker but they have tons of beer options, hence the name.  Price is very reasonable ($10-$18) and the portions are enough where you become full.  The only thing I would not recommend is eating their on a holiday.  I went there for father's day and the service was lousy.  We reserved a table beforehand and when we got there, they gave the table to someone else because we never responded to the text saying we were here even though they never told us to respond to a text message saying we were there.  So we had to wait an additional 45 minutes just to be seated.  While people kept walking in and getting seated, we were literally the last ones.  The host didn't know what she was doing and didn't communicate properly to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-nanuet?start=40,3.44,3.72,3.72,2.8640000000000003,3.6080000000000005
10,Jason P.,"Bronx, NY",182,400,3264.0,2.0,2017-07-08,"I rarely write reviews under 3 stars unless I feel a strong need to advise others of the sub-par experience. I went to this BJs and had a great experience a few years back. I returned again last night and it was far from great. We called ahead the day before for a party of 7. We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our reservation (call ahead) time and were told that the reservation had not been ________ and that we would have to wait. This was not bad, as we got a table in about 15 minutes or so, which is great in my opinion for a party of 7 on a Friday night. Though I think because they had _____ our reservation (call ahead) they gave us priority which was nice. Our server was great at first quickly getting us our drinks and taking our orders....then...it started. The server took our order of 1 child's pizza, 3 burgers, 1 chicken sandwich, a ziti bowl and jamabalaya dish at 8:45 PM. So we waited...and about 9:10ish we were told by our server that it was ""coming up in a minute"". At 9:35 we were told that it will be ""out in 30 seconds""....we got our food at 9:45!! An hour wait for mostly sandwiches and pasta dishes?!!?! while what seemed to be the entire restaurant who came in well after us had eaten and left. Now the wait is annoying in itself but as a business there are ways to go about addressing it. An honest server is one who can tell the customers of the delay and the ACTUAL estimated food arrival time. A manager is another as any good manager would have come over to us and explained the delay and offered some sort of appetizer ""on the house"". The food itself was good, when it finally arrived, but at the point everyone at the table was a bit moody at the situation. Everyone ate about half their food and was ready to go. It still took some time to get the bill, pay it and some bags for our food containers would have been nice we never had the change to ask as our server disappeared after leaving the bill. Just an overall bad experience at a place that I like and wanted to continue to like. Their food is good, it just doesn't compensate for that kind of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-nanuet,3.36,3.69,3.69,2.568,3.5580000000000003
