3,Josh N.,"Simpsonville, SC",13,23,7.0,1.0,2012-02-04,"Wait staff was friendly.  However, we were informed that ""management"" decided the ONLY entree side vegetable they wanted to serve is broccoli.  Customer beware...they have mixed veggies all over their menu and are unable to serve it due to someones ""management"" decision.  As a bonus, they quit carrying landshark beer, which, is one of Warren Buffets investments.  wife and I vote it worst TGIF we have been to in six states.  I hope you like broccoli and the usual crap beer.  I have yet to see another TGIF cut corners like this one.  Searching out the nearest and closest TGIF besides this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chattanooga-2,,,,,
1,Gary N.,"Chattanooga, TN",3338,655,2164.0,1.0,2012-04-30,"Love the food, Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp my fav.  But the service sucks, slow bar tenders and overall ""ADD"" of the serving staff puts me and many other options downtown. In fact, as I wait and wait for someone to come around I am lowering this another level to one star. Well after about 15 minutes of waiting to see a bartender I found and blasted the Manager and left for Sticky Fingers. This may be the worst of any Friday's I have been to in years. You also have to pay for parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chattanooga-2,,,,,
4,Amy D.,"Wildwood, GA",6,15,,1.0,2013-03-14,"Worse TGI Friday's we have ever ate at. We walked in and was immediately greeted by the hostess. He said there were only 2 high tables available in the bar. For my family of 4, that was fine since we didn't want to wait. Our waitress took our drink order, and disappeared. The tall table behind us and another table were dirty. The entire time we were at dinner the tables never got cleared. What amazed me more is people would come in and wait at least 10 minutes for a table and there were two table that could have easily been cleaned and used. I watched several servers walk by the table and complete ignore the mess. It was pretty disgusting view to stare at during our entire meal. The manager came out and talked to a couple that must be regulars. After his 15 min. conversation he turned around, and ignore end the dirty tables. Several families in the waiting area and nobody even tried to help. Our waitress spent most of her time on the computer. I think she was trying to look busy because there wasn't that many seated customers.  Our food was ok. Most of it was cold. I ordered sizzling chicken & shrimp. I have had this dish several times and the point of sizzling is pan it is served on is hot and the cheese and chicken is sizzling in it. But you could tell the dinner was plated early and sat in the oven. No sizzle, cold mashed potatoes w/ a crust overlay from sitting under heat. Boys had steak and said it as ok and they wished they had just gone w/ a cheeseburger. Drink refills were slow, and waitress needed a personality. A smile never hurts anyone. Unfortunately this is the only Friday's in the area we will not be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chattanooga-2,,,,,
0,Jeff S.,"Gadsden, AL",14,74,132.0,3.0,2013-06-16,"This was my first ever visit to a T.G.I. Friday's, and from the reviews I've read after visiting this particular one, I believe I chose the worst one to visit. Upon arriving we had around a 15 minute wait before we were seated, and as we were seated we passed quiet a few empty booths and tables, so honestly I don't understand why we had to wait so long to be seated.   We had a female waitress who took our order and only refilled our drinks one time while we were there, she was nice though, as was the manager who visited us once our food had been delivered.   As for the food, I had the Jack Daniel's Sirloin with shrimp, rice pilaf and Sweet potato fries.  The steak was ordered medium well and it came past well done, it was completely dried out on the inside with no pink at all and even charred on the outside.  This was pointed out to the manager when she visited but I am not one to have stuff sent back, especially since it took so long to receive the steak in the first place, so I just ate it how it was..  The manager was nice though and offered to have them cook me a new one.  The rice pilaf wasn't anything more than white rice with some herbs in it, this is not my usual rice pilaf when ordering it from other restaurants, but it was good.  The shrimp were juicy and very flavorful and the sweet potato fries were also very tasty.  My girlfriend ordered some kind of salmon with lobster over it, and it was decent as well.   Overall My experience was decent with this restaurant other than the wait with tables empty and my steak being overcooked.  I would like to try another T.G.I. Friday's but probably won't give this particular one anymore of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chattanooga-2,,,,,

2,Andi W.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,4,,1.0,2014-07-14,"Horrible....my husband and I go in and sit at the bar for a drink and appetizers (we are celebrating our 2 year anniversary). No server or staff said a word to us, the bartender was nowhere to be found, and the restaurant was just dirty and run down looking. The manager walked behind the bar at one point during the 10 minutes we sat there without being greeted at all, grabbed a beer glass, wiped it off with his hands (even around the drinking surface of the glass) poured a Draft beer in the glass and served it. We still have had no acknowledgment of even being there. This is when we left and walked across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings and we're taken care of famously and quickly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chattanooga-2,,,,,
