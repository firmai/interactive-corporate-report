16,R H.,"Fayetteville, AR",128,572,96.0,1.0,2012-01-14,The worst food I've ever eaten!  I would rather eat out of Taco Bell's Trash(I hate taco bell too) than ever eat anything out of an Applebee's again.  This review is not limited to the one location.  They all seem to be this bad. Only go there if it is your only option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
19,David S.,"Fayetteville, AR",9,87,8.0,1.0,2013-10-12,"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Applebee's. I lived close to this one and believe me, I wanted to like it. I gave this one several opportunities. The food was always mediocre and the wait staff and hostesses were consistently so oblivious, inattentive, and bothered when you spoke to them that I believe most anyone would feel that they were being treated rudely. This always confounded me because they practically share a parking lot with a Chili's, Colton's, Logan's Roadhouse, and are across the street from several other sit-down restaurant chains. The last time I was here, we sat at our table for 18 minutes after being seated without so much as having our drink order taken. Sure, I guess its my fault for actually sitting there that long before leaving, but the only purpose this place serves is to be extended parking for the other comparable restaurants next to it that actually wait on you, provide dishes cooked with more attention, and actually appreciate your business. If you must have Applebee's, the Fayetteville location is always excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
18,Steven G.,"Lowell, AR",18,17,4.0,3.0,2013-12-30,The server today was pretty well. The waiter kept a good eye on us for drinks and readiness to order/check. The food itself was really good. I had the new Napa Chicken with portobello mushrooms. I recomend if you do go. Order this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
17,Corey D.,"Anderson, MO",54,67,7.0,3.0,2014-02-18,"It was an Applebee's. We went in early, anout 430p. Only about 10 tables had customers in them. Asked the waitress, Summer (who took good care of us) which was better, the chicken tender platter or the fish and chips. She said chicken tenders. Wish I would've gotten the fish and chips. The tenders were tiny and slightly overcooked. Wasn't a fan of their honey mustard sauce. Their fries were yummy though. We had the luxury of being set next to the table of employees that were on break or didn't have any tables. They were loud. Very loud. So....as I mentioned, it was an Applebee's. Good thing Summer did a good job or this could've been a two star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
14,Jason W.,"Story City, IA",5,116,222.0,4.0,2014-08-13,I give this place 4 stars out of a perfect 5 Applebee's (not considering non-Applebee's restaurants).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
7,Laura C.,"Marion, MA",70,103,239.0,3.0,2015-04-10,"Went here for dinner with the family. Always a good option for decent food and to allow the kids to get a bit loud without bothering too many people. During this visit we had to wait 15 min for a table. Normally this wouldn't be a problem since it was a Friday night but I saw at least 4 free fully cleared tables just sitting there. Why the wait??? Once seated the experience was much better. Our server was fantastic , really efficient and made a great recommendation to try the hot bacon dressing with our salads. Um...yum! We also tried the potstickers whuch were much more delicious than I was expecting from a chain. My husband and I had steaks while the kids had burgers. Everything was acceptable and hot when served. Fries were crispy and drinks were refilled often. A solid choice for a relatively inexpensive meal with a diverse menu to suit most tastes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
9,Karl B.,"Bentonville, AR",0,27,18.0,1.0,2015-06-27,"Ordered the bourbon steak with a small Caesar salad. The waitress decided that I didn't need the potatoes and instead brought just the steak and the salad, then charged me for both the dinner AND a salad. The fish and chips was closer to sushi, feel free to use a timer on the fryer, we are not in a hurry.  The concept of a salad is to eat it BEFORE your dinner arrives, been that way for decades. It's not meant as a post dinner colon blow. The concept of deep fried fish is that we don't LIKE sushi.  Had to flag her down for steak sauce since she threw the plates down and ran away without even asking the typical question, ""can I get you anything else"" If she did, I might have asked for the missing parts of my dinner.  With so many restaurants in the area, customer service is what is going to win the battle. Better off crossing the road to one of the 5 other choices. I think Bentonville has too many restaurants and not enough workers to support customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
8,Don M.,"Rogers, AR",11,93,41.0,3.0,2015-11-12,"Went for dinner here one evening. My wife had the steak while I had one of their newer burgers. The burger was pretty darn good, still juicy while not being a sopping mess. However, the steak my wife had didn't even taste like steak, but more like steak-ish flavored tofu. We even tried covering it inA1 sauce, but that didn't help. If you want good steak, go to a steak place, as you'll probably be let down by that item at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
11,Steve B.,"Rogers, AR",10,82,42.0,5.0,2015-12-15,"Always great friendly service the drinks are goods pours. Food is always what is expected and great quality. We have never had to wait for anything and the wait staff seem to love working there not like a lot of other places where you have to hear how much they hate their jobs. Great job! Thanks for having such great employees, service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
13,Doug E.,"Rogers, AR",0,7,,1.0,2016-02-20,"Soo..  were do I start....  ordered 9 once sirloin wife ordered the 7 oz.. sirlon...  both came with 2 sides.  We both chose salid and backed potato.  Salida were small and iceberg lettuce.  Buy I wasn't expecting much..  back potatoes were not even average with a few sprinkles of cheeze at the bottom and some butter and sour creek on the side..  steaks were not cooked as requesed.  I ordered medium and recived well done.  Not even close...  on top of that these steaks both tasted like processed meat..  somethibg you would expect from a hungry man dinner at best... they did not look like a natural cut of meat at all and tasted very plain with texture of something processed.  Now I realize sirlon is not the high end cut, but come on...  hands down worst quality steak I have had in a very very long time.....  and what I am comparing to is not a very high bar at all.  But...  we did go ahead and eat the steaks because it was late in the evening and we were starving.....  time for the bill and found we were nickled and dimed  for each salad cause survey said it wasn't a tipically side.  Although she never mentioned that to us at all...  then charded extra for a loaded baked potato that were not loaded...  unless you consider a few sprinkles of cheeze and a little sour cream to be loaded...  so where are the sides that came with the meal?  Completely misrepresented!  And to top it off..  wife ordered a $8 mixed drink that was terabyte and neither of os could taste any alcohol in it at all..  and it was suppose to be made with moonshine!  Lol.   Not only was this the ripoff of the year for us.... When I tried to get an explanation from the server why we were getting charged for all the sides when she never said anything about them not being an accepting side item.....  she just walked off. With no further comment or appology or nothing....    sham on me for not asking for a manager to address all of this.....  but we're would I start actually....  lol.  What a dump...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,

10,Juliana P.,"Montrose, IL",3,2,3.0,1.0,2016-11-15,"Everything was fine when we got there, but it started downhill after we ordered. 6 of us went for my Aunt's birthday we got our drinks, those were delivered in a timely manner, we even got refills quickly. After we ordered our food we waited quite awhile for it to be delivered. Our salads were delivered fine but our entrees took a long time to get to the table. When they finally arrived my french onion soup was cool and the cheese a solid cold block, our waitress did bring me a new one but only filled it about 1/3 full considering that I had only taken a single bite and part of the 1/3 filled bowl half of that volume was a chunk of bread it was disappointing to say the least. My grandparents got the 2 for 25 deal; grandma got the shrimp and fries and grandpa got ribs. Grandma's french fries were cold and Grandpa's entire meal was cold. He asked for extra barbecue sauce 5 times and by the time it was delivered with my Aunt's dessert we were all finished. We asked for our check and that took awhile to get to our table and then the wait began. We tried multiple times to get the waitress to take it but she ignored our table and was instead talking to the other customers(which I understand is her job but to do so for 5 minutes or more unless taking an order is uncalled for when you have several customers trying to get some help )or talking at the bar with the other waiters, we finally had enough after 15 minutes of trying to get her to take the check we went to the front and gave it to another staff when the waitress ignored us once again. She gave it to our waitress who finally took it from her and then handed it back to the staff rather than to my grandparents. I understand waiters can get busy and things can get hectic but this went beyond that, Needless to say my grandparents  decided we won't ever be back which is sad since my aunt loves it so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
6,David G.,"Rogers, AR",0,21,,3.0,2017-01-29,Had a great waiter and good food.  Just wish the manager or bartender would take control of a situation at the bar.  A very loud EXTREMELY foul mouthed woman using the F word every other word.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
4,Stephanie S.,"Bella Vista, AR",12,9,5.0,1.0,2017-04-01,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. Arrived at 6:30pm on a Sat night & the place was half empty. Yet there were about 15 people waiting to be seated & we were told that the wait would be about 20 mins. After 20 mins, the host asked us if we wanted to sit in one of the 7 empty tables in the bar. (Same tables I pointed out were empty when we arrived.) The host said the empty tables behind him were open seating. We could've sat there when we arrived! Our drink order was taken by the guy assisting in the bar area. My coffee tasted like it had sat there on a burner ALL day. Eventually the assistant bar guy came back & took our order since no server ever came. After waiting for almost 30 MORE mins, we flagged the assistant bar guy & told him we had to leave. He said ""OK, let me grab your food,"" & then brought them out on plates! I told the guy I was serious when I said I had to leave to be somewhere & he offered to bag it up for us. It took almost 10 mins before he returned with the food and our FULL bill. My husband was pissed. People around us, who were seated 30 mins AFTER us were getting their meals at that point. No manager EVER came by to apologize or explain but I watched 2 people, who appeared to be managers, buzz around the servers who looked more confused than they did. So thank you, Applebees, for exceeding my expectations. I didn't think your service could be as bad as it was the last time I ate there (10 years ago!) but it was far worse. Thanks for charging me FULL price for horrible coffee & cold food that I had to wait over 95 minutes for then haul home to be eaten another hour later. I gave you 1 star because I HAD to if I wanted to write this review & warn people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
0,James M.,"Bella Vista, AR",48,44,28.0,3.0,2017-08-25,"My youngest daughter loves Applebee's ( largely for the tablet on the table to play games).  When we go it usually around lunch time and they are never overly busy. Main issue and their draw back I think is their waiters/waitresses, there are a couple good ones here the others are hit and miss.  Today I had the brunch burger which was good, burger was hot, so was the hash brown and egg on the burger. My daughter had the chicken tenders and sliders and both enjoyed their meals.  Main issue was never had refills, once after being told they would bring one and them I never got lemons for my water (which for me is a mush on water) Overall good food, just don't count on above average service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,

Kudos to him! This Applebees will have my service again! Thank you for keeping the drinks coming and the fresh food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-rogers-5,,,,,
