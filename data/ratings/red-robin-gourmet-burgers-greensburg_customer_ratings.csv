13,Big J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",49,388,268.0,4.0,2012-02-07,"Red Robin's burgers are so delicious.  In addition, how can you beat endless side dishes.  I ordered the Banzai Burger which has the exotic hamburger ingredient placed on top: the pineapple.  It was the first time I ever tried the Hawaiian spin off, and I have to admit it was fantastic. I also upgraded to the sweet potato fries, and I do not regret the 75 cent upgrade for one second.  It was well worth the few quarters.  The waitress was however below average and did not come over to ask if I wanted a refill until we were already completely done.  Moreover, when she did finally bring the fries, they were not even warm, and this was after she set them down saying, ""Sorry it took so long, but I wanted to make a fresh batch for you.""  Come on now... Other than the bad service and cold second order of fries, I would say this meal at the self-proclaimed gourmet burger place was a success.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

12,Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1447,650.0,5.0,2013-05-06,"YUM! This is more of an expression of how much I love that menus change and evolve.  Kudos to you Red Robin for including turkey burgers to your menu.  Sometimes you just need to change it up and enjoy yourself. There is something of a kick to your turkey patty, but it's a kick in the right direction.  It had so much flavor and the mixture of toppings were in sync to enhance that flavor.  And when did you get so wise to add endless root beer floats to the menu.  You devil you.   Staff was so very friendly and fast.  Especially hard of a feat when you have a toddler in your party.  But they served us with such grace that they were able to even entertain our little one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,,,,,

23,Chelsea K.,"Greensburg, PA",5,6,11.0,5.0,2013-10-24,"Red Robin of Greensburg was a surprisingly pleasant experience.  The staff, specifically Andrew and the current manager on duty, tried to make is feel better after my one year old niece got sick and vomited while we were having dinner. While they did not have to cater to us, they did everything they could, with empathy, compassion, and kindness, to make my sister and I feel less embarrassed about the little one being sick (we think she choked a little and threw up, honestly). We were not shunned because our little girl got sick. We were helped and consoled. It was refreshing that the staff put us at ease.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg?start=20,,,,,
22,Paul N.,"Avon Lake, OH",0,91,8.0,4.0,2013-12-17,Continues to be one of my favorite burger chains. Love the endless steak fries as well. Tues night so no waiting. Service was prompt and friendly.

26,John R.,"Greensburg, PA",5,12,3.0,2.0,2014-08-04,"This food is extremely greasy. We ordered the pretzel rods with cheese. Their was so much grease on the pretzels that the cheese would run right off. The burger that I ordered was also covered in grease and I could not finish it do to that. My friend ordered a wrap with crispy chicken, they gave her grilled chicken. However when they did fix the mistake the wrap was not bad. All in all, not a place to enjoy a good quality meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg?start=20,,,,,
17,Michele D.,"Woodbridge, VA",3,7,,2.0,2015-02-06,My husband and I walked in about 4:40 pm on a Thursday. It wasn't busy at all. Upon entering there was no greeter at the front but there were three female employees standing close by chit chatting having a great time looked at us yet left us standing there to the point I looked at my husband said let's go when one of the ladies finally approached us to seat us but not before making it seem like we were troubling her. The rest of the evening went ok but being that it wasn't busy it should have been a great experience. As you know there are other options in this area and we will look other places next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,,,,,
16,Marisa A.,"Turtle Creek, PA",4,4,,2.0,2015-05-20,"Went to Red Robin last week. Everyone ordered burgers. My oldest child ate half of her burger and found a hair in it. Ok, manager apologizes, takes it off the bill and replaces the entire meal for her. My other child can't finish her meal and takes it home. The next day she has the remaining burger for lunch only to find a hair in her burger. Needless to say we will not go back there. After spending close to $80 the food should not have hair in it. Just disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,,,,,
20,Paulie G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,16,1.0,2.0,2015-08-05,"Food was good; that's where everything positive ends about our experiences here. After 3 recent visits, each worse than the last, we said, ""enough"". The cleanliness was our biggest gripe. It can be remedied, but the fact that we saw the same bits of food material under the same table two days in a row, we had to draw a line. The women's bathroom was atrocious. The men's room was cleaner, but not perfect. Some may not consider this a major issue, but if a restaurant isn't very clean and management isn't attentive to issues, then what can you expect our of your food and service - not much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg?start=20,,,,,

They've seemed to be popping up around Pennsylvania over the past eight to nine years.... They've got some great burgers if that's what you've got a hankering for! Had the peppercorn burger and it was awesome! Also got their nachos as well and i really liked those too.... Both my wife and son enjoyed the food too, so we will be going back soon!

Nothing super special about their burgers, they are good, just not as good as a burger chain across the street. My little girl really likes it because of the atmosphere.

8,Sarah J.,"Greensburg, PA",33,10,15.0,3.0,2016-07-28,"Been here several times and figured I would finally post a review. Service is always average, sometimes you get someone really good but it's far and in between. Which is fine, it's a chain, what do you expect? Burgers are good, the sweet potato fries are good as well, but skip the sauce. It's gross. I wish I would quit forgetting to ask them to toast my gf buns! They are so gross without being toasted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,,,,,

5,Matt D.,"Irwin, PA",2,52,64.0,2.0,2016-08-30,"I have dined at multiple Red Robins throughout the US.  I think it is pretty much standard that all of their tables feel sticky and that they really have trouble remembering to place your napkins and silverware once you are seated.  As was my first experience at this location.   Our server was just odd.  She seemed very condescending.  And it pretty much took me until the end of our meal until I figured out, yep, she's a smart ass.  I guess I shouldn't have asked for silverware or ketchup, which really seemed to bother her.   And let's get something straight, I truly am a very delightful and pleasant person.  Until you disrespect me, my friends or family.   I just didn't have time or desire today.  My moms French Dip looked very good and well, it was better than I expected at a burger joint.  My burger, which I can't recall the name, was good as well.  It took at least 20 minutes which was a bit odd seeing that they just weren't that busy.   The bottomless fries are not a big perk or draw for anyone over the age of 6.  Although, since our server couldn't be bothered to check back on us, I didn't receive anymore.  And I actually was going to get a few more being that my burger came with about, 7 total.   I love technology, I really do.  And as we waited, and waited, and waited for our check I finally began to become a bit agitated.  When our server finally did show up and asked if we were ok???  We asked for the check.  She then pointed to the trivia device and said, "" it's right here,"" and walked away.   No explanation of the POS system or how to use it.  Simply, here's your check.  My mom, can't even use a cell phone or pump gas.  An explanation of how to pay our bill at the beginning of the meal would have been nice.   And, if we can pay our bill on the device,(which coincidentally adds a 20 percent tip) why can't we order on the device.  Heck, I'd even get my own silverware and run my own food if it meant I didn't have to deal with servers like the woman we had.   I would definitely go back, but the service is just a big letdown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,,,,,
4,Leslie S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",142,218,228.0,2.0,2016-08-30,"I've been to this location on three, maybe four occasions. The last two times were just recently. I feel that the food is okay, but not great. Some of the burgers are a little pricey. Yeah, I get the whole endless fries thing, but honestly, their french fries aren't really that good so who wants to eat a ton of them anyways? On my most recent visit, I met my parents for a late lunch. When our waitress brought over our napkins, she placed all of the silverware on top of the napkins and walked away. This included 3 forks, 1 knife. I passed them out and after a moment or so, my mom commented why there was only one knife. Of course, I didn't know. We asked the waitress, who stated that they were out of knives. ""I was hoping you could share,"" she said. ""So you are saying that they need washed?"" I semi-joked back to her. She said, yes, that was the case.  We placed our drink order and I almost always get iced tea when I'm out to eat. I can drink iced tea plain, but if it's really strong, like this one was, I like to add some sweet n low. Yeah I know it's horrible for you. Anyways, I ask the waitress for some and she says they're out, as in never received their shipment. I make a comment...something like ""hmmm....no knives, no sweet n low"". She thinks it's funny. I don't, really. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and cole slaw. My parents both had a regular cheeseburger and fries. My food was good. Nothing great. The cole slaw did have a nice flavor but was drenched in dressing. I like my cole slaw more on the vinegar-y side and if not, at least a little drier. Not soaking in mayo.  At any rate, not the best experience, but I've had worse. Would probably not return on my own free will. However, would of course go again simply to meet up with the folks and I'll bring my own sweet n low next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,,,,,
6,Samantha B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",19,66,118.0,4.0,2017-01-23,"After a long morning of bridesmaids dress shopping we all needed drinks and food!! We all agreed the diets starts on Monday :) None of us was familiar with the greensburg area so we really just pulled into the first place we seen. I've been to a Red Robin before and they are pretty consistent. We had to wait about 20 min for our table since we had a large party our host Angelo worked really hard on trying to find us a table rather quickly. While waiting on our table the bride to be bought all of us Bloody Mary's . My drink was pretty good. Now it's time to eat sooooo many decisions . I went with the nachos and my friend went with the onion rings to start. My nachos were ok nothing to write home about salsa, guacamole the basics. Now the onion rings were perfect not greasy or over battered. I ordered the turkey burger on the whole grain bun. It was really good. The thickness of the turkey patty was spot on and the option to add just about any topping makes this a sure thing. I had a good experience overall !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,,,,,
7,Bethany L.,"Lincoln, CA",14,38,2.0,3.0,2017-03-16,"3 stars for the food. ZERO stars for waitress. Worst service ever. I had to flag her down for drinks, fry refill, to order dessert...she was off the grid. Guacamole bacon burger was good, although I said NO pink & WELL done and it was pink upon arrival. I ate it anyway, mostly because she put it on the table, walked away and never came back. The cole slaw side dish was literally 1 tablespoon and not very good. Way too much celery seed. I'd return for a burger but if I saw this waitress coming I'd run!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,,,,,
1,Deborah N.,"Greensburg, PA",28,231,420.0,3.0,2017-06-25,"Updated - Sorry, Red Robin but I am dropping you from 4 stars to 3.  Mainly because the two hostesses working that evening, weren't very interested in making a good impression or friendly.  There were no other people in the foyer yet They didn't greet us.  As I was shown to my seat, the hostess handed me a menu that apparently had water spilled all over it.  I tried to ask for another one and she ignored me and walked away.  The pages were stuck together and it dripped all over my dress. When our server arrived, I told her about the wet menu.  She apologized.  She is the only reason I didn't lower my rating further.  She was quite busy with a lot of tables. One table had 12 people and she still managed to keep up with all her tables.   She thanked us for coming and wished us a good evening.  As we went out the door, the two hostesses ignored us again. There were no customers waiting.  They didn't thank us for coming and just continued talking with each other.

My daughter couldn't sit down, because, there was a mess all over her chair  Then, there was sauce on the table. There were fried chicken crumbs all over my son inlaws  chair.

9,Stacey M.,"Greensburg, PA",0,3,,1.0,2017-08-29,"I remembered Red Robin being better a few years ago. My husband and I went there for dinner this past Saturday and the food and service were horrendous. I would have to say the worst part of our meal was our server-she was atrocious. When I asked about the sauces she got a huge attitude and and said, ""Well you just had your menu open to that page I thought thats what you were looking at?"" Um first of all, I dont work here and you do, so its your job to educate me on your products. We ordered and appetizer, and she reached over between my husband and I and used the tablet to order it-not even telling us we could have done that. We were never asked for refills and she took his plate away without saying bye, asking about dessert, or even closing out our meal in any way. She just scowled at us from 2 tablets away as we left without saying a word. She was also chewing gum throughout our meal, which as a server I find disgusting, and I'm pretty sure isnt allowed. I did contact Red Robin corporate and asked for someone to call me, which they just responded and are refunding my money. I would have thought someone would want to hear about this, since their employee is an awful representation of their company-and shouldnt even be working with  the public. If I wanted attitude I'd go hang out at the DMV, you work in customer service get your shit together or get another job. We wont be returning, and judging by other reviews we weren't the only people to have this experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greensburg,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
2,Jac D.,"Irwin, PA",0,3,,1.0,2018-01-04,"I got one of their chicken sandwiches and when I took a bite, I first thought that I bit into a fatty piece.  I cut the sandwich in half and took a bite of the other side, and it was the same texture.  It felt as if the entire piece of chicken was a bad piece or mostly cartilage.  The server did not come by once to ask how everything was.  By the time she came around, my friend had finished her meal, so we just printed check out at table so we could leave asap.  I did not want to make a scene and it would have been too late at that point to wait for another meal to be prepared.  I will never return to Red Robbin again.  The thought of that chicken actually makes my stomach upset.
