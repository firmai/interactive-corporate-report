56,Lucas H.,"Gales Ferry, CT",28,7,15.0,1.0,2012-03-06,"By far the worst service I've ever had. Started out by sitting at the bar. The bar tender took forever to come over. Apparently side work is more important than making money. Any way tried to order the two for deal. But she said with my selection that I had to make it the three for deal. I reluctantly agreed. I picked the cheese cake for my last choice. Beside the fact she never took another drink order. She never brought out the cheesecake she made me order. So I asked for it she said it wasn't ready. Seriously, a frozen cheesecake isn't ready since when. So I waited. And after all my friends left after eating and paying, I asked again, still not ready. At this point I had to be back to work. I simply told her to keep it. Thanks and thank god it's not Friday today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chesapeake?start=40,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

7,Bianca M.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,59,60.0,1.0,2015-06-13,I'm never coming here again. Everything was fine until my sister got her food. We told the waitress we were here to celebrate her birthday so you'd think that would have made our experience better. But nope.  The food runner pretty much shoved my sister her dish. Even though it was hot. Fine. Whatever. We look at the plate and we can tell the burger has been sitting there for awhile. The plate is covered in oil and the bun is so soggy and sponge-like. No big deal. We let the waitress know. She takes the dish back and doesn't really say anything. She didn't ask if my sister wanted something different. Not cool.  2 min later a guy brought out a new meal. That was pretty fast so we were suspicious. He did the same as the last food runner. It's like us being there was an inconvenience. And my sister is pretty sure they used the same bacon for this new burger. Gross. She could only eat a few bites and we were done. The server didn't seem to care that her birthday dinner was killed. We get the bill and she shorted me on my change. Who does that? But it's all good cause that went towards her tip. Thanks for making that easy. You lost two customers.

We ordered our food and it was overall decent, and we had also made an order to go to bring home for the next day. We made the mistake of not checking it before we left, however. The next day, I went to go reheat the food only to find the steak we had ordered wasn't cooked. Not not cooked correctly. It wasn't cooked. I had a takeout box lined with butcher paper with a slab of raw meat in it. It wasn't even seasoned! Just a raw, uncooked, unseasoned piece of meat. I reported it to the company immediately and days later haven't heard back from anyone.  Apparently they think it's perfectly fine to serve raw food to customers. I ordered the steak rare. Not raw.

The restaurant was empty (Monday night) except for maybe 2 or 3 other tables and our main course took over 30 mins to arrive to our table.  Why does food seem to take longer when the place is empty? To the server's credit, he agreed the wait was too long and got our appetizer comp'ed, took 25% off the bill and it still came to $27 and change.  We left him a good tip for his honesty and effort, but I am done with these chain restaurants and wish they all would close.   The last time I ate there, we made the mistake of wandering in on a Saturday night and the place had been turned in to a dance club, complete with a DJ and security guards doing their best to look tough, guns and all. We misjudged the atmosphere based on the filled to capacity parking lot, but once inside, nothing but sneakers, baseball hats, gold chains and girls barely dressed.  Never again...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chesapeake?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.116,2.64
35,Terry T.,"Chesapeake, VA",138,162,1812.0,3.0,2016-02-16,"I hadn't been to Friday's in ages so when my buddy asked me to join him for dinner I happily accepted his invitation. We arrived about 6:45pm and I was surprised to find the dining room nearly full. There was still ample room in the bar area so we headed in there and sat ourselves. We were greeted promptly by our server who was quick to take our drink orders. She returned with our drinks (a couple of decent Stella draft beers) promptly and brought menus as well. The bar tender and the server kind of used a team approach and both served our table at different times. Between them they did a good job of checking on our drinks and taking care of us. It had been a few months since we'd gotten together so after we ordered we spent time catching up and just chatting away. Eventually we realized it had been about 45 minutes since we placed our order. The server was proactive in coming to the table and explaining that they had overcooked my rib eye (I ordered medium rare) so they had to fire another one. She said to compensate for the wait they were discounting our entrees by 50%. I thought that was decent and it turned out to be the difference between a three-star rating and a two for this review. Fast forward, our entrees finally arrive. A medium rare rib eye and half rack of baby back ribs with coleslaw and seasoned fries for me. A medium flat iron steak and half rack of ribs with seasoned fries and mac and cheese for my buddy. My steak was cooked medium instead of medium rare and was not very tender but it was seasoned nicely and flavorful. My buddy's steak was a thicker cut and it was cooked medium rare instead of medium. His steak was not as flavorful as mine and he complained it was a little tough to chew. We both agreed our baby back ribs were extremely dry though the barbecue sauce was very tasty. The seasoned fries were spot on, hot and crispy and delicious. My friend was disappointed with his macaroni and cheese, The taste was okay but there was an enormous amount of bread crumbs on top which detracted from the overall taste and kind of dried out the moist pasta and cheese underneath. My coleslaw was nice with a delicious flavor but was a tad sweeter than I would like. All in all the meal was just okay but it could have been so much better. The bartender and server were friendly and personable. The restaurant was clean (even the men's room) and attractive. We ordered a couple of shots of Patron Silver, our favorite tequila, and got a nice pour. We left fairly satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chesapeake,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.316,2.68
50,Otis D.,"Portsmouth, VA",0,1,4.0,1.0,2016-02-23,"Traveled across three cities to finish off our families ""Day of Celebration"" for my wifes birthday. Things progressively went downhill from the moment we arrived. After a 45 minute wait with a party of four (with ample seating seemingly available) we were seated and eventually approached by ""one of the managers"". Thinking that this would help things run smoothly...i could'nt have been more wrong. She was there to take our drink order and found away to totally botch the task. I was also asked to remove my license from my wallet to see if it was EXPIRED. I neglected to mention my wife left the table...perfect opportunity to request SURPRISE BIRTHDAY TREAT for her and ""The Manager"" said surrrrre. Finally the food order was taken...which we wish it hadn't. The food was basic at best...presentation was awful and 3 out of 4 was missing items. I asked ""another manager"" and he agreed my plate was missing items he'd get them right out. After 15 mins he returned with...yes saut'eed onion and peppers barely cooked and 15 minutes??? Needless to say...way into the plate and really passed the point of wanting the vegetables. We asked if an item had tomato and to have it removed at order time and our waitress replied they CAN be removed....followed up with ""The MANAGER"" who states tomato is not in that menu item. Menu seemed to show tomato but our plates didn't look remotely close to menu pics anway. After the meals were done...waiting patiently for the Birthday Treat....we hear singing and see a line of employees who go passed us to another patron. My wifes says i thought you set me up...well no..They set me up because the TREAT never came. I again approached 2nd manager and advised him that the 1st manager said they'd sing and bring a brownie dessert....he replies ""oh...i see your family is still seated....i can box it up for you"" really??? He then looked at me like....I can really box that up for you...neglecting the fact that it was now POINTLESS!!!!! I had already paid the bill and even left a tip so  I expressed ALL issues from beginning to end and he offered no discount...no coupons..just an empty I am sorry. We were able to conclude that it wasn't the size of the crowd....it was the fact that the service is completely broken from managers to servers...I work in the area of this place and have been several times...always seemed disfunctional...however at next mention..my vote will be for some other establishment.

When I go to pick up (usually between 12-2) the place is empty and I pick up from the bar. Bartender always looks bored to death and is never personable or friendly.  I ordered an app last time and my potato skins were completely burnt and inedible. I should have checked them before I left. Today I ordered a salad with extra dressing on the side. Hot chicken was placed in the same container as my salad so my salad was wilted and warm by the time I got across the street to my office. The extra dressing was about 1/4 of a small ramekin. I don't even know why they wasted their time pouring it. The chicken was the driest I've ever had, I had to throw it out. Not worth $13.  I dined in once last year at the bar for lunch and my salad at that time was fine but the chicken also really dry. I didn't eat the chicken and asked for a side plate to place it on.

34,Josh V.,"Chesapeake, VA",51,58,221.0,1.0,2016-07-03,"Went on a Sunday evening where it was empty. Had a group of 17. When we walked in the place it was not busy at all but for some reason they insisted on us having to wait for our entire party to arrive (even though we were all trickling in) in order to be seated.  As we were being seated we realized that all the tables were separated by fours. We asked if we could move the tables together since we wanted to actually eat together but they said it was policy not to put tables together. This is odd because we come here pretty often and have never had issues.  We spoke to the manager who said it was policy and I asked her if it was worth sticking to that policy in exchange for losing the business of 17 hungry people. She then said if it was that big a deal to us to sit together she would let us move the tables together.  Like for some reason we are the weird ones for actually wanting to sit together as a group.  We ended up leaving and went to Cracker Barrel where they gladly accepted our large group as well as our huge bill we spent with them.  Needless to say not only did they lose our group's business for the evening but we will not be going there as group from now on. But hey, at least their policy is still in tact.

My mom raved about the Jack Daniels bbq ribs here, and how they were doing a 10$ full rack deal with 2 sides! (Holy smokes...) It was my dad's 54th bday party and we had over 20 people come down to feed, so my mom wanted to order 10 racks, to go (a monstrous request).   After 3 phone calls from various different relatives not from around here trying to ask for the same thing, 3 online orders placed, and a huge headache on my end, the manager was able to accommodate us for 5 full rack of ribs for 50$ rather than the 10 half racks at 100$ that we initially accidentally ordered. I sincerely apologize to them for my family, I know 10 full racks of ribs to go is highly unfair to reserve for to go orders and I'm grateful they gave us 5 racks at least (we ended up having 1 extra!). The kids LOVED the mashed potatoes and the cheddar mac n cheese sides. There was some more confusion of how to get refunded for the first 2 orders that was placed, but when I called back around 10PM the manager told me he had already taken care of the refund request to corporate for me and would call me when he got a confirmation that they were completed and the money is en route to me. A lot of people would be fed up with us by that time, but he handled it with the best customer service attitude possible. Very impressed and again, this time we were the ones giving the restaurant the headache so much appreciated to TGIF. They've had our business since we moved here back in 01' and will continue to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chesapeake,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

23,Jessica P.,"Chesapeake, VA",101,109,61.0,4.0,2017-04-21,"4 1/2 Went here for New Year's. Ok. Disclaimer. I seriously was expecting some crap ass bar food.  I was actually salty. This seemed to be our only option. Lots of places were closing early. We had kids who were ready for bed. We didn't have a fridge yet. Literally no other choice.  But. This story has a happy ending!!!!  I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. And husband was happy I wasn't a big grouch.  Apps:  Pot stickers were better than expected. I thought a chain restaurant wouldn't be able to dish out some Asian food, but they were really tasty!! Warm pretzel bites w cheese sauce - ummm cheese?! Yes please!!! Very good. Only complaint was they didn't bring enough cheese out!  Boneless BBQ wings - yum. Saucy.  Burger - jack Daniels burger. Cooked perfectly. Too many places ask how we would like it cooked and it never comes out the way we requested. TGIF's burger cooker is the real MVP.  Have been back for happy hour and drinks. Always happy with our visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chesapeake,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
15,Just K.,"Bel Air, MD",0,1,,1.0,2017-05-08,"We arrived at TGIFridays a little after 4 pm. So they were not busy for lunch or dinner.  2 out of the 3 of us ordered the endless apps promotion. We all ordered places our orders and waited patiently for our food. The 2 that ordered endless apps received their first plates. Then they received their second plate. Then a few minutes later I received my food which shouldn't have taken longer than 10 minutes to make. (Grilled shrimp and fries dish) while we waited the table next to us complained to the waiter about the dry meatballs and other items. They were told that he would check with his mgr. but couldn't promise anything. Both were met with no's about removing their items from their bill. After 3 plates of apps I finally was able to speak to the expeditor about receiving extra sauce. Which also took longer than necessary considering we were 2 tables away from the kitchen. The apps started taking longer and longer to come so I ordered dessert. By the time my dessert came the other two in my party gave up on getting more food and called it quits. With all that being said he refilled our water once and the other drinks that were not water never got refilled. I tried calling the survey line and got a ""sorry we are closed"" message. So thankfully YELP is never closed. Overall endless apps means you must have endless time to wait for food and when you do you get toddler portions. If you have a complaint you won't get he manager to come to your table just a cross your fingers and hope. If your still not happy ... well you can only complain until 5 pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chesapeake?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

I give the cheese sticks a pass but the chicken quesadilla were not very good at all. I love quesadillas and these were proble some of the worst I have ever had. The drinks were good price for happy hour however they are super weak.

30,Angela M.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,9,1.0,2.0,2017-11-18,"On Nov 18,2017 @1:00, my family and I went to TGIFRIDAYS to celebrate my niece birthday. You know it's going to be bad when the wait staff did not want our table.  It was only 8 if us! Out of a crowd of LAZY wait staff there was one who said she would take our table. Didn't know staff could choose who they want to wait on, to me that's a reflection on management (poor management). Thank God for Sabrina, the wonderful waitress we had who volunteered to wait on us. She was great! Even though she had numerous tables she did her best to check on us, bring drinks when needed, didn't have to ask. It's hard to see one person running while other staff just standing around. She called for the staff to sing ""Happy Birthday "" but they never came, UNBELIEVABLE!  The biggest thing they were not busy at all! They sang for another table but not for us. We decided to thank Sabrina for understanding true customer service we left tips and encouraging notes for her. Poor management results in lazy workers!  Hopefully management will wise up and hire people who really want to work. I understand why they have 2.5 rating. Food was good.

24,Isobel H.,"Chesapeake, VA",91,12,8.0,2.0,2017-12-06,I hadn't been to a TGI Friday's in years until this visit and I remember why. The service was awesome but the food was severely lacking. I got the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp and my chicken tasted like the rubber like chicken you get in TV dinners. Flavorless and chewy. They were also pretty pricy which I wouldn't mind for an amazing meal but this was far from amazing sadly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-chesapeake,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
21,Marc L.,"Dale City, VA",58,104,45.0,2.0,2017-12-27,So I gave this two stars simply because the Bartender was great and the Mules were strong. However the food was absolutely horrible man. We ordered the endless apps and my buddy did too. He also ordered an order of fries. The fries came out and were over cooked and crunchy as hell. Then the bonless wings came out and they are so crunchy and burnt that even being smothered in sauces that didnt matter. EVERY SINGLE order came out tlike that. So it's pretty obvious the fry station has a very inexperienced person on it or they just don't care.  To make matters worse the restaurant is like 30°because their heater is broken but they keep the damn fans on like that's gonna help. Uh no your just making it worse on the customers man.
