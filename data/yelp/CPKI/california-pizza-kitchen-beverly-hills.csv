Richard R.,"Culver City, CA",88,210,1778,4.0,7/18/2015,"It's way too long a story to explain how we ended up eating at CPK on South Beverly Drive today. We normally go to the one in Marina del Rey or Manhattan Beach. But once we made our dining decision I was a little curious about how the Beverly Hills location would measure up with our usual expectations. Honestly everything was just a little better. First of all this location is different from the others. It's a more intimate setting. Not so cavernous. We really liked that. The service at CPK is usually good but not great. Our server Anjuli was totally on point for our entire meal. Even when she was taking care of tables around us she was excellent.  Now for the food. We ordered the Avocado Club Roll appetizer, half Thai Crunch salad (does anyone really need a full one of those?), half Chicken Caesar and a bowl of the Smashed Pea Barley soup. Every one of them was just right. Same recipes I'm sure. But the soup wasn't so overly thick (or gloppy). The proportions of the Thai Crunch salad, perfect. The ratio of crunchy noodles to lettuce to edamame to dressing is really what makes that salad work. The same was true for my Chicken Caesar (proportion wise) with the added bonus that the grilled chicken had great grilled flavor and was still so moist. The Avocado Club Roll was cooked just right and perfectly rolled so it stayed together as we were eating it. To top things off we sat right next to the window and had a front row seat for watching how people were dealing with the days sudden rainfall. How can it get any better than that?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20

Kerri H.,"Torrance, CA",1488,642,2725,5.0,5/5/2015,Great lunch specials!!!! The food was fantastic and the place was packed....

Lawrence C.,"San Diego, CA",285,1104,5334,4.0,3/11/2015,"This is our first visit to this location. It was good, but not as good as most (maybe all) other locations.  We were seated at a table and chairs that still had crumbs on them. After we brought this to the attention of the server, she did apologize and immediately clean all.  You would have thought that when the manager came over later to check on us, he would have commented on his own. .... he didn't,  but he knew about the situation. Not a big deal, but it was noted.  The rest of the dining was fine. Good food, good value, good service.

Katrina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,1,,5.0,9/17/2016,"The host seemed genuinely cheerful and delighted as she seated us, which was a really pleasant surprise especially considering how rare that seems to be at a lot of restaurants.  Sweet start to our Saturday night visit already. Our server, Rafa, was so sweet and hardworking too.  He really got that upselling, prebussing, checking up, and speed with service down for the multiple tables he had at once.  I love how he concluded my night with a warm welcome back and said I was a pleasure to serve. Luis, the kitchen manager, was extremely friendly and inviting.  He was truly more than happy to listen to my feedback on their Wild Mushroom Strozzapretti, which is one rich and savory dish, I tell ya.  He was very attentive when accommodating for my needs.  He went above and beyond to ensure that the experience was satisfying. I can't wait to return and expect nothing less than the amazing service I received tonight.  Definitely going to this CPK as much as (if not more than) I go to Westwood; Beverly Hills CPK is way too good to pass up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20
Harper L.,"Central LA, West Hollywood, CA",1,6,1,3.0,5/28/2017,"Even though there are always a ton of waiters, the wait time when you're at your table is usually super long. The quality and freshness of the food has gone down in the past year which makes me sad because I like their menu. The reason I'm still okay with eating here is because they have simple food and it's affordable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20
Pamela W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,37,,5.0,9/10/2017,"BEST chopped Italian salad!!! Salami, garbanzos, mozzarella cheese, the works!! I think this is the best chopped in town! Beats LaScala's chopped salad, to my surprise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20
Bridgette L.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,212,403,4.0,1/19/2016,"Okay...let me start off by saying, I LOVE CPK and their new updated menu items. For those of us who are trying to get healthy this new year, I appreciate the healthier selections available. I came here with my family; I oprdered the kale salad with fish. It was good and light. My family ordered a thin veggie pizza with one side, one side that. The chef accidentally got the order wrong and they replaced our pizza at no charge.  This location is a bit on the smaller size as far as tables inside go. They do have additional tables on their outside patio however.  I really liked their California themed decor and pictures on their walls. It really set the California vibe even though it's still in Beverly Hills.  The staff and waiters are all very friendly and attentive. Love love love that they will bring you wine glasses if you order a bottle of pelligrino. It really sets the feeling of being classy in.  Last but not least, this location is more family oriented so if you're expecting a quiet outing, skip this location. Parents with big families and children tend to frequent here a lot. The noise level might become too loud for some.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20
Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,648,3116,5.0,1/28/2016,"We are new to LA, so we thought it would be fun to explore the ever famous Rodeo Drive and to do some window shopping. We had a leftover gift card from Christmas, so my husband and I stopped in here for an early dinner around 4pm last Saturday.  First of all, I would like to point out that this is THE original CPK restaurant.  It's a neat little space, but not that different from the other restaurants in this chain.  Still has fun decor!  Our server was great and very quick with refills.  I thought the food was delicious, just a *bit*  fresher than the other locations.  This restaurant is an easy walk to the high end Rodeo shops.  Unfortunately, we parked in a pricey garage, but I would like to point out that the city has cheaper lots around, so do a little research before you leave home.  If you plan your parking better than me, you can save a few more bucks.  We were also in and out quickly and we do appreciate that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20
Daisy C.,"Culver City, CA",265,217,119,3.0,10/12/2015,"Venue This CPK is my favorite; however, be prepared to fight for parking. There is a 2 hours free lot across the street (only during the day). There is also metered parking. You might be able to score a spot on the side streets, but BEWARE of ""Permit Only"" signs.  There appears to be a full bar, booths, and tables. The layout is not the cleanest, but it's very clean.  Food Admittedly, this is not my favorite restaurant. I know several people that love it. I just don't ever crave it. Plus, there aren't many vegan options without mushrooms. As always, I was craving carbs, so I opted for pasta. I ordered the Spinach and Asparagus Spaghettini (no cheese). This is perfect, because it comes in a marinara sauce. The portion is huge, so I only ate half of it. The pasta was nicely cooked, the veggies were tender, and it was the perfect amount of sauce. I don't want my pasta drowning in sauce. Service One thing that I have consistently experienced at CPK is great service. The floor managers always check up on the guests. The servers know the menu and are on point. This time was no different.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20
C T.,"Carson, CA",0,3,2,1.0,1/1/2017,"Happy New Year until you get to CPK Beverly Hills. Instead of honestly gauging the time for pick up, you are given an incorrect time that lands you at CPK almost 40 minutes before your order is ready. Shameful looks at management can be seen by other customers who were also surprised after waiting over 30 minutes only to find out thier order was still not ready. Either hire additional help or honestly quote the time for pick up. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this one out. Customers will leave happier with thier order if you don't mislead them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=20

Tiffany F.,"Inglewood, CA",126,29,44,4.0,3/10/2016,Ben was an excellent server. Ben greeted us with a smile upon being sitted. He took our drink order and offered us bread whie we waited for our drinks. He brought back bread then took our order. He checked on us periodically and asked if we needed anything extra. Our food didn't take long to come out at all. I felt like our food  was served to us ten minutes after we ordered. This location is not a very big location I would recommend this location for people who have children who decided that wanted to go out to eat. This place is not accommodating to large parties.

Jordan F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,3.0,4/2/2015,"For a CPK, the experience was okay, but not as great as other locations for a number of reasons.  We were surprisingly seated 5 minutes after we arrived considering the restaurant was not very crowded and there were several tables which could accommodate our party that were already set. We ordered our drinks (water) which came 10 minutes after we ordered and we ordered the macaroni and cheese for kids which came out very promptly (before the water). When we were ready to order, we told a server we were ready to order, under the impression that he was our server (if our server had taken the time to introduce himself, we would have know what he looked like). This server was not very pleased that we told him we thought he was our server and very coldly told us he was not OUR server and stomped away.  Eventually our server arrived and took our orders. The rest of the dining was fine and the food arrived promptly. The food was fine, nothing to marvel about, but remained consistent to other locations I have been at. The price of the entire meal was not worth the experience.  It is likely that I return (with lower expectations) as I have been to this location before and had better experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=60

Today I came in for lunch.  After the service I received today I felt I needed to write this review. Something is going on because I don't remember this sort of elevated service in the past. The host opened the door. Sat be right away.. and offers so sort of reward card. Waiter Zac was there in a second or two. Food is the same.. good. It's always good. The manager stopped by to say hi..

Mohan G.,"Campbell, CA",3,85,1,3.0,11/27/2014,"I am personally a fan of CPK. However, I am not convinced with this location. The waiters here are too good but too slow as well. we ordered some water, and it takes more than 5 minutes to serve it. The waiter took another 10 mins before he came and took the order. And guess what ?? the waiter explains the food very well but it doesn't taste like what he explains. we get our starter in 15 minutes !! We ordered some garlic added pizza, and the garlic was so raw in the pizza and our mouths started to stink. The waiter never said it would have so much garlic. It took about 30 mins to serve the pizza. I had to go and ask for some water at the counter to get it as there was no waiter to care for our corner table.  Avoid this place if you are too hungry.

We had the Asparagus and Arugula Salad which tasted good with the light cheese and peanuts.  Then we had the crispy mac & cheese.  I guess we weren't thinking of Mac & cheese flat ball but it was okay.  And for our main dish we had a fish with this grain that reminded me of mom's cooking, definitely a plus!  Unfortunately I don't remember the name nor do I see it on the online menu, must be a special.  The sangria was between poor to okay quality.

I had the Waldorf salad with chicken. The salad was excellent. My nephew ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza that was total disaster. As the pizza was way under cooked and stale. The chicken was try. As it took the server over 20 minutes to bring a refill on an ice tea and a juice. Finally the manager came over to refill are drink orders. No questions the customer service needs a major overall. I have no clue why a person would have to wait over 40 minutes for a pizza. Not one time did the server ask if you need anything else while we wait. It took over 20 minutes to bring over some bread.

Patrick W.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,110,72,2.0,10/27/2017,"I used to like coming here years ago. A friends choice for birthday dinner forced me back and I must say that I can confirm my disappointment. Two years prior I was given a gift card for my birthday and ate at CPK in Studio City. Overall, what annoyed me the most was the very minuscule portion of Chicken on the pizza/Salad.  Anyways, this again occurred at the CPK in Beverly Hills. I ordered the Bahn Mi bowl and was highly disappointed- lack of flavor, and again, a minuscule amount of Chicken- for an expensive price compared to any other chain restaurant. I also had the Two in a bowl Soups- my choices were the Farmers Market and Sedona Tortilla. They were both tasty. The service was good, no complaints there. Overall, the stingy portions of Chicken have left a sour taste in my mouth with this place. I would  not recommend any dish with meat, in particular Chicken. By the way, it was $4 for Chicken added to the Bowl (which was $15). Crazy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills

I felt very welcome in the restaurant's casual ambiance. It is great for families, lunches/dinners out with friends, or going out on dates!  The food, as always, was delicious and high quality! I am a vegetarian and they have tons of options for people who don't eat meat, such as the margarita pizza, California veggie pizza, and more!  Also, insider hack/tip: order the spinach dip appetizer but sub pita bread for the chips-- amazing!! CPK is a great bang for your buck and always leaves me wanting to come back for more.

However, when we walked in, no one was around to help us so we stood there waiting to be seated for a good 5 to 10 min. In fact, the lady that walked in behind us just helped herself to seat. Is that how it works at this CPK? After getting seated, we ordered our pizzas (Original BBQ chicken and Margarita). In my opinion, they are the best pizzas on the menu. You can't go wrong with the original bbq chicken and the margarita is on a nice thin crust with a nice light taste.

Not a lot of customers in store. Took about 13 minutes for the food to be ready.  Now, the food is good enough, but a chicken cesar salad is NOT worth $16. After I drove back home, I discovered that they forgot the chicken in the Cesar salad. I'm too tired to go back but I called to tell them what's up. Me: Hi. I just ordered takeout from you guys and you forgot the chicken in the Cesar salad. Now, I'm not going to come back for it, but I thought you should know.  CPK employee: Oh. *pause* *disingenuously* We're sorry. Me: *pause* Thanks. Bye.  CPK employee: Bye.  Now they apologized, which is good (+1 star). But they clearly didn't care based off of  the half assed apology (-1 star). No offers to make my experience better or promises for what they will do next time (-1 star).  The takeout FAPS: Food: 4/5. Good when they remember what I ordered.  Atmosphere: 3/5. Slow. Parking: 3/5. It's Beverly drive, it's gonna be rough.  Service: 1/5. Could have been more engaging. Could have sincerely apologized for forgetting the chicken I paid $4 extra for. Could have told me what they would do differently next time. TL;DR: Food is good enough when they remember the order.

Well, if you are a bit oblivious to the current state of popular culinary affairs in Los Angles, you won't know that CPK is basically like the fast food of pizza... started by two lawyers in the 1990s, this place actually used to be a nice place to take your kids to, now, it has become a huge chain restaurant that even has its own frozen pizza line... these days one can't really discern between the frozen stuff and the shit they actually serve in their restaurants; no, that is a bit harsh but hey... their pizza is shitty, so they deserve a bit of healthy scathing... Don't bother with the pasta, it is a joke... the pizza is the only saving grace and that is going further downhill every day is huge chain stays in business... the cutting of costs has been apparent over the years of CPK's operation in the US... 3 phrases that come to mind when I think of CPK: 1) boring, sorry excuse for pizza; 2) smell of babies and greasy penny pinchers; 3) ugly ass decor that gives me migraine whenever I try to visualize it Take-out?

A few weeks ago we ordered lunch for the entire office and as a few times before they forgot some stuff which is not a big deal but it says alot about the lack of attention to detail.  Anyways when the food was delivered one and the delivery person left,  we found out that one of the Pizza we had ordered was completely burnt and that they had forgotten the side of Avocado for another Pizza, so being that the pizza was burnt we called the store and they said that it would not be a problem and that they would send the delivery man back with the missing item and an new pizza. THEY COULD HAVE LEFT IT AT THAT..........and we would of gone about our day and been done with it.... BUT the chef decided to send the driver back with a message, who the driver would not relay to anyone but me. Proceeded to pull me out of a meeting, only to have a delivery man tell me that the chef sent a message to me, stating that Margarita Pizza are thin crust and that they are prepare that way and they burn??????!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? this was not my first time dining out here in Beverly Hills.....Who does the Chef think he is???? he never even saw the Pizza and he said that they are prepared like that all the time??? completely burnt?????  I mean that is possibly the rudest thing someone can do when they hadn't even seen it. Either way I was so upset of the fact that a chef would give himself the right to send a driver back with a message when it was their shortcoming in the first place, and many other times when we never even complained, (which now i wish i had) that i called the manager and had a conversation with her in regards to the lack of professionalism and lack of service from her store, she was very sorry and said she would speak to the chef about his conduct, and that she would send a gift card as an apology. SO guess what! never received the gift card.........Kind of tells you were the staff is picking up the bad habits....when a manager promises something and doesnt follow through what can you expect from the staff?????????? lets just say this CPK lost our business for good! we have officially moved our business to the La cienega store where they have delivered excellent service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=80

She seemed to be constantly pushing to us to order already, although this was around 9P.M., and the restaurant was getting empty, yet not closing quite yet. She asked us if we had decided what we wanted to order on her FIRST time to the table. This was certainly not particularly pleasing. Furthermore, she did not bring out the complimentary bread and butter until we asked her, after she had taken our order. She did refill our drinks consistently, but then again, there was only one other table in her zone that was occupied, so that is to be expected.   I ordered the California Club Foccaccia sandwich with a Caesar Salad for my main course. The staff forgot to add the avocado into my sandwich, which angered me because it is one of my favorite things in the sandwich, and because it is clearly the reason the sandwich is so expensive. Nevertheless, the sandwich was tasty. My girlfriend enjoyed her Pasta Bolognese. So, overall, the food was decent.

The great crusty sourdough they used to serve has been replaced with pasty squishy wonder-like bread.

Shannon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,596,186,3.0,2/28/2015,"I am making this location my first review for CPK since they have the whole 'Reimagined Menu', which means they offer things not available in most locations.  About ready to order one of my usual defaults (turkey/chicken club sandwich on ciabtta-they no longer have focaccia bread), I noticed they had a classic crispy chicken sandwich and a oven-roasted turkey with brie that I've never seen before. I decided on the turkey since it has pears and honey mustard, which intrigued me. Pears tend to do that.  But what got me most excited was the baked potato soup and a s'mores dessert. I chose the soup over the usual caesar salad, and got the dessert to go. In all honesty, the soup was good, not great, and the dessert I feel would taste much better eating it there in the establishment. The chocolate pudding was tasty, when I could get to it, as I battled through the marshmallow topping.  After a quick search, I think Westwood also offers this menu as well.

They gave me barely a sprinkle of chicken breast and at most 2 cups of salad. For $12?! The actual flatbread I did order looked like it might have been a full order at some point but that was certainly not what I got. It has been quite a while since I had eaten at one of these establishments since I moved out of the area. Such a disappointment.

Location is south of Wilshire on Beverly Blvd, so it's a little easier to manage parking wise.  At a minimum, there is a garage directly across the street, and the first 2 hours are free.  If you are into a sweet finish to a meal, go a few steps around the corner from here, and you're at 'Lette Macarons.  All you foodies out there already know the place, but for those of you who don't, go find out why I mention them.  Anyway, I digress.........

Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",692,1141,31,4.0,5/25/2006,"I've been told this is the original CPK!  Right smack dab in the middle of Beverly Hills!  The food is great, like any in this chain, but here you are likely to see a few celebs chomping away on shrimp scampi pizza or the chicken caesar salad.  There is also a high chance of sitting next to a bunch of rich bored Beverly Hills kids, or some really excited tourists...which is a little annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=160
Michael K.,"San Mateo, CA",38,136,11,5.0,8/30/2007,"My favorite CPK location, and the ORIGINAL!   I grew up around here so I have plenty of memories here.  I grew up with the growth of the company and I still love it. I have always liketd the pizza at CPK... even the pastas are tasty and their salads aren't bad either.    Now that I think about it, I even like their appetizers, although they are WAY overpriced whereas most items on the menu are an OK deal.  Don't be ordering a pepperoni or a plain cheese pizza, or God will kill a kitten for no reason. Let's be honest people... CPK invented the BBQ chicken pizza.  Every other pizza joint that has a BBQ chicken pizza is merely treading in the wake of the ORIGINAL.  --- Barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce, smoked gouda cheese to give it a nice flavor, red onions, BBQ chicken, and cilantro.   I pray that you aren't one of those people who claims to dislike cilantro.  If you are, maybe you should order off the kids' menu...  My favorites: Their eggroll type appetizer with the dipping sauces Chinese chicken salad Thai pasta Carne Asada Pizza (probably has the most flavors going on) Sweet and spicy italian sausage pizza BBQ chicken pizza Some others I can't think of..... The pizza must be on the HONEY WHEAT DOUGH please. Stay away from the tostada pizza.  Lettuce (or anything WATERY, like fresh tomatos) on a pizza makes me want to kill myself.  And you best believe that before I die, I will take at least 100 kittens with me for no reason. The staff is always on their toes because bitchy Beverly Hills moms are very demanding when it comes to sending back pizzas, getting orders perfected, etc.   Therefore, for a normal customer, they are usually quite competent of taking care of your order.   Never in memory have I had bad service here. I also believe the cooks at S. Beverly Drive have been there for a really long time, because they put out consistently (which is the #1 most important factor) the best pizza of any CPK location I've tried.  You can see the experience in their technique. Another plus about this location is there's plenty of parking in a city lot nearby.  As well as ample street parking for most days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=160
Marc H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,66,,3.0,11/20/2012,"I love California Pizza Kitchen.  I can't rate this location 5 stars because of the difficulty with the interior noise level.  There are so many families that visit this restaurant and because of the acoustics, the noise level is too high.  Along with that at times it feels as if I am eating a Chuck-E-Cheese with the children crying, running around and falling out of their chairs.  This is a very convenient place for the area and it is too bad it is not larger to accommodate the families in a family area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=160

Lina R.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,59,18,2.0,3/4/2009,"OH how I will never ever ever come back to this CPK ever again. I honestly love CPK but when I went to this one it absolutely changed my perspective. I ordered the lemon piccata salmon, spinach artichoke dip, and bbq chicken. Don't worry I shared with someone. LOL but anyway daaanng our food took about 20 minutes. I was about to eat the forks that were on the table. They didnt even consider giving us bread and butter. HOOOW RUDE! I even saw my serve just hanging out talking to her other HOMIES! OMG so when I get my lemon piccata salmon. EWWW on how raw the salmon was inside. I LOVE SALMON BUT NOT WHEN IT'S RAW. I couldn't eat it and she didn't even bother refilling my peach lemonade.

Rachel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,15,,1.0,9/8/2011,"terrible in every way. the service was bad. was in there for probably 15 minutes before the waiter even came to take the drink order. the food was subpar, to put it gently. i've been a few times, so i expected them to be busy and the food to be a little too greasy, as usual, but this time they took it to a new level. even the bread was stale and hard. i would not recommend this place at all. i ordered a pizza which was supposed to have chicken and avocado. it was mostly pizza with lettuce on top. there was some avocado but almost no chicken. the whole experience was simple awful and i wont be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=180

Helen S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",236,485,,4.0,3/12/2009,"Compared to my other CPK experience in Rancho Cucamonga, this location was MUCH better but still needs a little improvement.  9 of us stopped by for dinner and they quickly set up a table for us and get us started right away.  Food is typical of CPK (which is usually very yummy), and service here was pretty good.  The only thing is that each time that anyone in the group or I needed a refill, it took a while for us to catch the server's attention.  Other than that, it was a fairly good experience.  Love the BBQ Chicken Salad and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. YUMMY",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=180
Denise K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,6,,3.0,7/13/2012,"typical california pizza kitchen. the outdoor patio really is nice however you know that cars drive by and waiters aren't always around.

We were taking in the scenery and saw CPK. We had to eat there, it was a lovely day and not crowded at all. As always I got the Penne pasta with extra sausage... It adds that little kick in my opinion and a glass of Merlot. It was delicious. I have eaten at a lot of CPK's and I have yet to be disappointed. The spring rolls are also a great appetizer and the service is always excellent. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=180
A M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,74,,3.0,5/2/2009,"Come one come all!!!!  You know what this populist ""California"" pizza tastes like if you've ever pulled it out of your grocer's freezer, and the fact remains that this chain of all chains scratches an itch like none other.  They're constantly updating their menu with cheesy, starchy goodness.  I just had the Buffalo Chicken pizza and if I was drunk or high, this monstrosity would've reinvented food.  As it stands, it was pretty damn good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=180

Gray W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,1,1.0,7/20/2012,"We live down the street from this location so we frequent it for dinner. However on our last visit, we found a hair in our salad so I gave it to our waiter and told him what we found and that we didn't want another one to replace it. A couple minutes later, the manager Esther walks over to the table and says, ""Can you describe the hair that you found; was it long or short? Dark or light?"" I looked at her with my jaw hanging open. She didn't waver in the silence and eventually said, ""I want to know so that I can see who isn't wearing their hairnet."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? She didn't apologize for the incident ONCE. As if I wasn't disgusted enough by finding a hair in my salad, the manager is going to ask me to describe it in detail? And not try to make amends?! I was dumbfounded and cannot believe that someone in a management position would behave like that. Come on, CPK, they should know better.

Christine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,60,,4.0,12/29/2008,I don't care what other people say.  CPK is good.  They are always busy so that should tell you something.  It's a great spot for lunch or a casual dinner.  I've been there about 30 times and the food and service is always on point.  My favorite dish by far is the chicken waldorf salad followed by the Japanese veggie pizza on honey wheat crust.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=180

Stephen M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",117,196,4,3.0,2/16/2007,"The final tally at California Pizza Kitchen always takes me aback a bit and makes me want to paraphrase Dorothy: ""We're not at a Chili's in Orlando, FL, anymore, Toto."" Granted, CPK is more adventurous than your typical sit-down chain - a big plus - but I can't ever quite shake the feeling that I'm eating somewhere whose menu has been poured over and endlessly revised by corporate types and their overpaid ""expert"" gastronomic consultants (and why am I not one of those? Oh, right, because I have weak moments when I'm convinced that there doesn't exist a finer example of food than cheese puffs - an automatic disqualification, probably). Maybe that's why the food is always less exciting in your mouth than it was in the menu's description. This location is always bustling - I suspect CPK is a slumming Beverly Hillsian's version of grabbing a hot dog from 7-11 - but the service is always efficient, so whatever the wait, it never feels unnecessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=180
Ethan R.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,20,,4.0,8/9/2006,"CPK is a nice family restaurant. The food is really good, and it's one of my favorite pizza places in LA. However, there is often a 10-15 minute wait, and the service can be slow. Therefore, i would definitely recommend CPK to someone not in a hurry. However, if you are in a hurry, go to CPK ASAP which offers a rather speedy CPK meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-beverly-hills?start=180
