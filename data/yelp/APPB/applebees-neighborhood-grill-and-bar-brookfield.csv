Gina S.,"Oregon, WI",305,931,1953,4.0,7/31/2010,We got Applebee's curb-side-to-go. Takes roughly 20min so call before you leave to pick it up and it'll be there when you arrive. I had the Asian Crunch Salad...my mom had the Oriental Chicken Salad. Kids eat for .99cents on Wednesdays...drink included! I find this to be better than McDonald's personally.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brookfield
Torrie B.,"Milwaukee, WI",75,101,37,2.0,7/4/2014,"Stay away! My boyfriend and I needed a place to go for dinner during the Waukesha power outage. To begin, the table was extremely sticky- not a good sign. We started with nachos and drinks. My margarita was very sweet, which I wasn't expecting from a house blended drink. Nachos were ok. The reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because our waitress was nice and service was fairly fast, but my meal was not appealing. Pasty mashed potatoes and veggies had a weird, sour flavor. Steak was cooked ok; I wasn't expecting the highest quality. I have eaten at different Applebee's restaurants in the past and I know they can do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brookfield
Alina T.,"Milwaukee, WI",120,79,15,1.0,5/3/2014,I was part of a party of 7 grabbing lunch the other day for a co-workers' going away party. First they tried to seat us in a 4 person booth but we spoke up and asked for a table to be made for us. Once seated out order was taken and we got our drinks. It took about 57 mins to get our food. No they weren't busy. I am pretty sure if we didn't call a manager our food would have taken even longer. Overall we were it happy with our experience. I normally don't go to Applebee's so I can't comment on the food from Applebee's to Applebee's but it was cold and awful. I got the shrimp and chicken tequila tango. It did not look anything like the picture. I may have gotten food poisoning from it. Never going here again. I suggest you don't as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brookfield
Ben R.,"New Berlin, WI",19,9,17,1.0,10/7/2013,"The 1 star is appropriate given the lunch menu was expensive and the service was slow. I was amazed at how small the portions were, too. So for 9ish dollars, with an adequate tip, I'm more hungry than when I had come an hour before. The food was just... blah. Stay away. This was sad. Empty at 12:30 means something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brookfield
Paul C.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,3,7,1.0,2/10/2013,Everything from the mostly clean tableware to the apprehensive bartender screamed sub-par third-rate and outdated. I won't bore you with details. I never ate the meal I ordered.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brookfield
Ben K.,"Chicago, IL",45,59,10,3.0,3/22/2014,"Standard Applebee's food at standard Applebee's prices. I highly recommend the $1.99 long islands and half-price appetizers after 10 PM. This location is exceptionally outdated and literally FEELS tired. It appears run down. This is the only business that remains in the strip mall and I feel like I've heard for a long time that it's going to be rebuilt, but it never seems to actually happen. It's never very crowded in here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brookfield
