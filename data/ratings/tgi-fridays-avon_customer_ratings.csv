1,Andrea K.,"Grand Rapids, MI",53,54,194.0,4.0,2012-08-01,"This TGI Fridays is interesting to me. For some reason, the food at this one tastes better than at many of the other ones in the city. Dunno why, but I'll take it since it's near my house. They don't seem to have a very busy dinner rush, it's pretty predictable like all dinner rushes, but knowing that I can easily get a table at 8:30pm on a Friday, makes it an easy choice to go.  My only strange complaint would be that every time we are seated, we are always seated right next to another table with people. Now during a busy time, I get it, but when there's only like 3 tables with people in the whole dining room and I have to sit right next to all of them, it's just weird, and this is the only place that I have ever seen this happen regularly. So it's a strange complaint, but honeslty, it's really my only main complaint about something that happens regularly.  The rest, well, it's a chain, which knows how to actually prepare it's menu, and that can mean volumes! The service is pretty standard, sometimes a bit off-key, but mostly fairly decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-avon,,,,,
4,Shantel A.,"Camby, IN",61,37,21.0,1.0,2013-01-03,"My husband and I went for dinner last week to this location and were incredibly disappointed. We were seated in the bar area (which was fine) but our server/bartender seemed to be overloaded because he only checked in on us once after our food arrived and never refilled our waters. It wasn't even busy. I ordered the Jack Daniels Flat Iron (which I love!) medium-well and it came out burnt. I had to cut around the burnt spots. The entire time at dinner, I just kept thinking that we should have went to Texas Roadhouse across the street for dinner. There may have been a wait but the food would've been worth it. I won't be making that mistake again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-avon,,,,,
3,Jim C.,"Plainfield, IN",18,12,,4.0,2013-03-30,"So, I'm gonna start off with a negative.  We were seated and waited over 25 minutes for a server to come to our table.  Four or five parties were seated near us, served drinks and had orders taken while we waited.  My wife and I were ready to walk out.  Finally, I saw a manager and approached him to tell him our situation (I'm sure my frustration was OBVIOUS). A waitress who had another zone across the dining space came over and took great care of us.  She was fantastic and thanked us for being nice...she was expecting us to be jerks. The food was great and took a little longer than normal, but the flavors were fantastic.  The manager came by and told us that it was all on the house due to our excessive wait.  Glad he rectified it.  Fridays is one of our favorite date night places, and they restored our faith after a terrible start.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-avon,,,,,
5,Dana D.,"Jamestown, IN",16,9,1.0,1.0,2013-05-29,"What on earth has happened to TGI Friday's legendary training program?  Secondly, I have to ask if they have a food cost problem. Hubby and I dropped in at TGI Friday's in Avon about 7:15 p.m. on a Tuesday.  I guess the rather empty parking lot should have been a clue.  We were one of only 6 tables seated in the restaurant.  I counted five servers on duty and it took 4.5 minutes before our server came to our table to greet us.  I give her credit... she was perky. Beyond that, I've never had a server at TGIF who was so clueless.  Hubby asked her about what regional / micro-brews they currently carried (the drink menu had a list of regional breweries and said ""Ask your server for our current selection."")  Her reply was something along the lines of, ""Well, that list is kept pretty up to date; I'm not sure beyond that"" as she pointed down to the drink menu.  Remember... it had only BREWERY names.... not products.  He ordered water.  After she left the table, I urged him to ask a specifically about what they had from a particular local brewery. Suffice it to say, the interface with the server became more pathetic... but she remained perky. Now about the food.   I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich; hubby ordered the small portion of ribs.  The sandwich description noted that I had the choice of homestyle potato chips.  I asked Perky if they were made in-house... she said, ""I don't know. I've never seen them cooking potato chips."" I ordered the fries.   I will concede that the sandwich was tasty.  However, I was shocked at the fries.  The portion was skimpy at best and it almost looked like someone had grabbed a handful off of the plate... they were scattered, flat in the middle and didn't look like normal placement (I've worked in the industry as a mgr... ). They were also lukewarm and not fresh. Hubby's plate was even more shocking.  His fries, while a few more generous than mine, still looked like a kindergarten portion. But the ribs... oh, the ribs.  5 bones abt 3 inches long.... and I calculated there was probably a whopping MAYBE 2 ounces of meat total. In fact 2 oz may actually be a generous guesstimate.  Needless to say, the value of that plate did not equate to the greater than $10 price tag. It didn't take us long to consume the meager offerings. (I gave half my sandwich to Hubby as his portion was not near enough for even the average size man.) We then sat. And sat. And sat.  Perky finally whizzed by us twice without so much as a glance.  She had one other table and they were done as well.  After AT LEAST ten minutes of being completely finished she stopped by and wanted to know if we were interested in one of their ""DEE-LISH-US"" desserts.  We politely declined and asked for the check.  Fortunately, we got that quickly, but Hubby had to slide his empty plate out of the way to sign the receipt... Perky never bothered to clear the table.... or refill water... or check to see if our food was okay beyond the initial drop on the table and run. Oh... and a side note... never saw the manager walk through the restaurant.  We were seated near the kitchen and I happened to spot him... talking on his cell phone. As chains go, TGIF has been one that we were willing to stop into here and there over the years. In the past they had consistent great service, generous portions, and quality food.  However, this experience has not only soured us to the Avon location, but we will be driving  past TGIF as a choice elsewhere.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-avon,,,,,
0,Jen F.,"Indianapolis, IN",131,313,209.0,3.0,2013-08-20,"We dropped the truck off for a quick tint job and needed a quick place to grab dinner. TGI's wasn't busy and it was handy so we stopped in. Burgers were pretty good.  A little on the dry side, but places like this just won't give you a pink burger.  The sweet potato fries were freakin' awesome.  They were crisp and nicely seasoned. We were well taken care of without being annoyed. I'd stop in again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-avon,,,,,
2,James W.,"Avon, IN",20,12,4.0,4.0,2013-11-20,"I like Friday's. You just have to know where you are. They actually have a nice menu and the meals I get are quite tasty. The atmosphere in the bar area is great!  We really love it!  yeah, it's not high quality food, but it's an enjoyable place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-avon,,,,,
6,Carol C.,"Avon, IN",16,5,,2.0,2014-04-12,"I ordered the flat iron steak and shrimp on a screwer, with the tomato mozzarella salad. They totally forgot to give me the salad and the steak was very tough. I never saw shrimp served that way. It was like on a halfshell. It was hard to eat and hard to keep the shell out of your teeth! My brother-in-law ordered the same thing and felt the same way. My sister got somekind of sandwich, she was very disappointed with it. We won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-avon,,,,,
