The trio's are excellent as well. I actually don't remember a bad meal there. The service can be a little slow, but in their defense, it is busy most of the time.

I got the rib tips and fries.  Wife got chicken penne noodles. You get to choose a appetizer and a desert also. We went with bonless wings and cheese cake. The waitress was very nice. She made small talk with our kids in the truck. We waited around 30 mins and at first they brought out the wrong order to us. We paid the bill tipped 8bucks and drove off! When we got home found that the ribs were burnt and had very little sauce. My wife said hers was fine. Boneless wings were just soggy and flavorless. (Soggy maybe from togo box, understandable.) And dessert never made it into the bag. Been here several different times and been disapointed a lot. Fustrating. The waitress highlighted several things on our receipt to do a survey. I think before she takes the time to do that she should make sure that all the items have found there way into our bag. I will try my beat to stay clear of this chain.

I am always hot so the fact that I left my jacket on the whole time shows it must've been COLD.  Two, Our waitress, Deborah D, was horrible. She came to our table to bring us drinks and take our order, and that's pretty much it, someone else brought out our food and refilled our drinks because I told them our waitress vanished. Every, Single, Time, she walked by she made no eye contact whatsoever, had nothing in her hands, and pretty much just ran from one side of the restaurant to the other ignoring us completely. The two times she did actually come to our table she came dancing toward us ridiculously, and didn't even stay long enough to let us accomplish anything.  Three, My food was cold and I was never able to flag her down to tell her, I asked her for mustard and ranch which I never got. I didn't eat a single bite of my food which she didnt even ask about as she dropped the check and left before I could say anything again.  And lastly.... just to add even though its silly... we should've recieved 6cents change back, and she only brought 5cents. Like I said, silly... but the truth. She could've said ""I ran out of pennies or something"" but she didn't. She dropped the receipt and nickle and continued to run around doing NOTHING, but trying to look busy.

37,Linda C.,"Beaverton, OR",61,285,21.0,4.0,2014-03-14,"Looking for some food in Salem on a weekday and it is well after 9pm. Where do you go? Applebee's.  At least that is where you go if you're not from Salem and hungry.  We have been to this particular location twice. The first time was the normal Applebee's experience. Unmemorable.  This time around was probably the best Applebee's experience that I have had in all my Applebee's dining experience, which is something I can count on one hand.  To begin with, it was clear when we arrived that our hostess and waiter seemed to have had a long night. The restaurant wasn't very full when we arrived so we probably just missed a big rush.  I imagine it was just one of those days for them. I get it. I've had those too. Despite this, they were nice and friendly.  The waiter was attentive and we even had the manager stopping by to say hello. That's the first time in my Applebee's dining experience that the manager stopped to do this.  The menu has a variety of food items for whatever you're feeling. Sandwiches. Steak. Chicken. Salad. Whatever. It's Applebee's.  If you expect more than that...well... I don't even know what to say then.  It's Applebee's, that should say it all, right?   At least I know that if I'm in Salem after 10pm and I'm hungry, I know where to get some decent grub.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

Tonight I warned the hostess my order might be ""needy"", which I KNOW are words of death to servers and hosts and kitchen alike (I am on a restrictive diet). She let the server know and he promptly came over and took my order (7oz. steak but with extra veggies instead of potatoes, but instead of taking the potatoes out entirely I had them added to my boyfriends order to go). Kudos to Tyler, our server, he waited on us and was great, as well as clean cut. I was by myself and he sat down with me at my table to take my order. It made it feel very personable. My water has been filled three times promptly when it's been emptied, but he knows not to ask questions when our mouths are full. Drink prices are a little high. When we sit in the bar area, I can see the fridge containing the wine bottles and I pay 7.99 for a glass of wine I happen to know is 4.99 for a bottle on the bottom shelf of my grocery store. Price on food is fair. I think 11.99 for steak, potatoes and veggies is pretty good. I do feel the AC is a notch too high but I always feel like that in any Applebees.

The staff was friendly this time although I felt like the manager approached us too often.. Maybe that's just because I was trying to eat. I got the happy hour 1/2 special.. My boyfriend and I shared the boneless wings which were only like half covered in the sauce. One even only had some on the tip. I got the cheeseburger sliders, which came out very pink..... How hard is it to fully cook a hamburger that small? I asked for them to make me new ones but get them to go, they were nice and apologetic. When I got my to go bag we left and went home.

He was perfect; laid back yet attentive. What I ordered doesn't qualify as a cheeseburger but the photo in the menu was so good, I had to try it: Brew Pub Philly!! Thinly sliced steak with American and craft beer cheese, piled high with batter fried jalapenos, peppers, and onions, all on a ciabatta roll. I could only finish 3/4 of it and I have to say it tasted just as good when I ate the rest at home.  Mom got an All Day Brunch Burger which reminded us both of a back-home favorite in Hawaii, the Loco Moco. It was cheeseburger enough for National Cheeseburger day; a thick ground beef patty with American cheese but with the astonishingly good tastes of fried egg, bacon, onions, hashbrowns and just enough ketchup, it became our new favorite!

First, the hostess looked miserable. She walked like she was just really tired of the being an executioner; and with what they try to pass off as food here, I feel for her.  Second, even though the place was dead at prime lunch time, it took 10 minutes for the waitress to greet us and bring waters. I looked around and I'm pretty sure I counted more waitstaff than customers. Still, our waitress was MIA the entire lunch and I even had to ""call waitress"" on the table top computer thing just to get our check.  And finally, the menu and food. Look, it's lunch time. Why has Applebee's not created a real lunch menu? Instead of this you have two options: Their full dinner menu at full dinner prices, or their crappy ""mix-n-match"" lunch, which is extremely limited. I had their version of the clubhouse, which came with super sweet BBQ sauce and--no bacon??? It was slapped together with a level of care only possible at Applebee's. I had to dissect and reassemble it. I ""matched"" it with a Caesar salad that came un-tossed and was about 1/2 a handful of lettuce, at best. This with a 1/2 sandwich for $9.

29,Kyle R.,"Salem, OR",33,1020,240.0,4.0,2016-08-16,"We've come here now twice this year, and both times had the same great waiter.  Food is decent and prices are reasonable.  Sure their menu is a confusing mess, but once you sort it out it's not too bad.  On both visits it wasn't too busy during off-hours, which was nice.  They have a diverse selection of salads and mine have always been good.  Apps are plenty and all are tasty.  In the end, I won't ever give Applebees 5 stars, because you know, it's freaking Applebees.  BUT it could be way worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
3,Jill J.,"Salem, OR",0,2,,1.0,2016-08-28,"Started off being quickly seated however the first table suggested was dirty with leftover food still on the table despite the table being set up for a new group. We requested a different table.  Our water and lemonade were quickly delivered, order taken in time, appetizer in time and food also arrived in timely manner. Next came several problems.  We waited FIFTEEN MINUTES for a refill on my daughters lemonade (we had placed the empty glass in plain sight at edge of table) so she had nothing to drink with her food. We pushed the "" call server"" button then waited another 6 minutes before a woman who appeared to be a hostess who stated she had no idea where our server was but that she would let the manager know.  I informed her that we would like boxes to go as well as a lemonade to go since we had not gotten any refill after waiting. We gave the tip to this woman as she was the only one who took the time to check on us after 16 minutes of waiting.  A gentleman from the table seated close to us literally had to get up and walk over to the hostess station to request a glass of water for his wife because they also had been waiting a very long time. ( with their call server light as well on).  Our server just disappeared without even apparently the hostess knowing where he was. As far as the manager being told......we never spoke with a manager and they made no effort to come speak with us. We just got out boxes paid the bill and left.  Being served food then nothing to drink and ignoring customers for 16 minutes even after having the ""call server"" button pushed (on other tables as well) is absolute terrible service in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
26,Ann D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,21,15.0,2.0,2016-09-27,"Just ordered a regular hamburger and some fruit. Fruit came in a hot bowl and must have been heated to thaw out the frozen strawberries, pineapple and apples... Hamburger was nothing special from this hamburger restaurant. Hoping to get something to eat from traveling through Oregon and staying at a local hotel, but not even this popular place could suffice my hunger craving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-salem-17,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

The food was good but one thing I didn't understand. .. my steak wasn't cooked the way I wanted it and they took it back but brought my sides to me. Once my steak came back my sides were cold. They left my steak and took my sides to heat up. TIP!!! Take the whole plate and bring the meal all together. Don't get me wrong food was good just not a hot meal. :( my mom loved her burger! !!!
