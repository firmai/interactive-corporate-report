Broccoli was so over cooked it was moosh, my bfs steak was over cooked, we let them know but said he would still eat it. Manager never came to apologize and they didn't take any money off the bill. Also my mozzarella sticks came out semi warm and didn't taste all that great. And our loaded mashed potatos didn't have chives... The food was a huge disappointment and now I'll never return there...

67,Jojo L.,"Orange County, CA",104,403,241.0,3.0,2012-02-04,i barely come here but im glad they still have their 3 courses for 2 people! flatbread appetizer was delicious! its like a cross between a flatbread with spinach dip :) it was slightly crispy which i liked. i also loove the string beans here i forgot what my sis' dish was called but it was pasta w/ grilled chicken. i actually thought this was pretty good. the hint of balsamic really made it stand out petite sirloin: eh just average. kinda reminds me of something you could get at Dennys or Norms. for dessert i tried the brownie obsession  and this DEFINITELY satisfied my sweet tooth cravings.  the brownie was soo rich and was even better w/ that scoop of icecream on the top. mm! i sat in the bar area on a friday night and service was okay. the table wasnt wiped down and was a little bit greasy but not a huge problem,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=160,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.476,2.96
66,Deborah A.,"Irvine, CA",62,125,373.0,3.0,2012-02-10,"Ironically, coming here on a Friday night at around 9 in Yorba Linda is still pretty busy. Our server was super chill. We originally came here to use the buy 1, get one free entree coupon, and wanted to get away with 2 of them, but he said that they may or may not, since they're getting more strict about it, but their manager agreed, and let us do it. I'm not sure how the Jack Daniel ribs came out, as my parents got it, but I got the 3 for $20 deal.  Their mozzarella sticks were typical, nothing usual, but the marinara sauce was STONE COLD. It was very hard and not appetizing. Even the warmth of the mozzarella sticks couldn't do anything.... I got the petite sirloin, it was nothing special. The meat lacked flavor, but TGIF isn't known for their steaks. The only good thing on my plate was the stuffed mashed potatoes, which had flavor.  My sister got the fried shrimp and fries, which was pretty cold. I don't think she liked it. The shrimp could have been crisper, it was more moist and soft to the touch. The fries, where to begin. I don't think they should have been called fries.... The dessert was alright. We got the vanilla bean cheesecake with chocolate sauce drizzled all over.  I think the only good thing about TGIF is the low price during happy hour and the 3 course meal for 2, if you're on a budget. Otherwise, go elsewhere for better food.

Drinks arrived within minutes.  We are not talking about sodas, but our alcoholic drinks arrived within minutes which is usually very rare for any restaurant. Our order was taken when the drinks were dropped at our table. Our food arrived within about 10-15 minutes after that. I have never had faster service at TGIfridays than we did tonight.

Otherwise, I've never had a bad meal there. The drinks there were always weak. Also, they cut you off after 5 drinks, which to most people sounds like a lot, but when you're with a bunch of your friends, sitting outside and smoking and talking for like 65 hours straight, 5 drinks is nothing.  When I used to go here, I would sit either at the bar or outside. The inside table seating is awkward and weird, and definitely not well thought out.

93,Adrian Y.,"Anaheim, CA",68,35,23.0,4.0,2012-08-08,"A couple disclaimers about my review: First, this is strictly based on their HAPPY HOUR appetizers and drinks (because that's basically the only time my friends and I come, usually after work). Second, I think the restaurant as a whole is probably closer to a 3-3.5, but you simply can't beat the prices and amount of food you can get from HH. My coworkers and I usually sit in the bar area and the staff are familiar with us and treat us very well.  Jamie and Tim in particular are always extremely friendly, quick, and on point.  I really couldn't ask for more from them.  The appetizers are cheap and decently sized.  We almost always get the nachos, large and taste pretty good for what, $4?  $1.50 for a single slider or fries, $3.50 for a 20 oz beer, $4 well drinks. Overall, a good place to hang out after work with some friends and get cheap food and drinks.  It isn't a Michelin Star restaurant, but it's got a good atmosphere with great staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=120,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.416,3.0000000000000004

For appetizers the dragon fire shrimp (or something of the sort) was pretty delicious. We ordered the triple dipper appetizer. The cheese dip was nothing to write home about, the hummus was good, I didn't even try the salsa, didn't look appetizing.  I ordered the salad with strawberries, goat cheese, balsamic and walnuts. It was yummy. I also ordered the pasta with shrimp instead of chicken, tomatoes garlic sauce and capers. The pasta was delicious but they went overboard on the capers IMO.

177,Sharon S.,"Orange County, CA",73,15,8.0,5.0,2012-08-23,"I have been here several times over the last year. It is a nice local place to grab some lunch or dinner. Conveniently located in Savi Ranch near the freeway (might not want to risk trying to navigate around Savi Ranch during rush hour). There is plenty of parking.  The host/hostess are ALWAYS very friendly and enthusiastic. Upon being seated, the guest is told the name of their server and wished an enjoyable meal (every time in my experience). I have not yet had a bad server/service there. Last night it was Joseph (Joe) and he was GREAT! He was friendly, attentive, accurate and very genuine & personable. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, drinks were refilled in a timely manner as well. The resturant is clean and there is a patio which is nice, but it is somewhat bland and boring out there.  I won't comment on the taste of the food (since that is subjective and everyone's taste is different) but the quality of the ingredients is good and the food is appropriately hot or cold when it comes to the table.  I have eaten in the bar area one time and felt that the service was equally as good as in the dining room and the patio.

Then she still didn't seat us so a busser or server said I'm not good at this but I'll seat you. Where does he sit us? Right next to screaming kids even though the place is empty...loss of one star here Then after seated it takes another ten minutes for our server to come to us. I am assuming this is because we are in a back corner with the screaming kids....loss of one star here  The food came after another long wait. We even got our food at the same time that we got out free appetizer for checking in...would have been a loss of a star but the food tasted good! We got chicken piccata pasta and Fridays shrimp. Even as I draft this review we have been done eating for 10 minutes and have yet to have our table cleared and our check delivered! We got our check delivered after over 15 minutes and when I promptly gave the server my card he ran it and returned and put the check down...I grab it to to put a tip and sign yet he had not left me a pen.

The waitress was really nice and we got a free appetizer because we checked in on Yelp. Yay for freebies! So the waitress was really nice, but the service sucked. She kept forgetting things. First of all, we had our 2-year-old with us. My husband and I ordered salads with our meals and she brought them out to us, which was fine, but she didn't bring anything out I had ordered for my daughter. Okay, if you're a parent, and your kid is hungry (and even if they're not hungry), you know to never eat in front of them because they'll flip out. She won't eat salad, so I couldn't share with her. She was going crazy asking where her food was. The waitress walked away and I had to flag her down to ask her to bring something for my very upset kid to eat. She brought crackers. Phew! For our free appetizer, we ordered the hummus. It was good, but I hate it when restaurants don't bring enough chips or bread or whatever you need to eat the dip. We took huge scoops of hummus on our chips, but by the time the small plate of chips was done, the hummus bowl was still half full. There was no offer of more chips. She didn't bring out the drink I ordered until half way through the meal when I reminded her that I had ordered an iced tea. She also didn't bring out the garlic breadsticks that came with my meal until I had finished eating everything and reminded her that I was supposed to have garlic breadsticks. Those were the most half-assed breadsticks I've ever seen and they didn't taste like they had any garlic on them. Yet they were called ""garlic breadsticks."" Disappointment.

Her answer was ""she signed a paper and had to check everybody"".  Come on people, what ever happened to a little dose of common sense???  When the ""manager"" (must be self-annointed as she surely can't manage a damn thing) came over she plays stupid and says its the server's decision.  Not willing to do business with such stupid people we left and even though there's not alot of places to eat in YL we will never be back to this place!!!  Join me in protesting stupidity and eat elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=180,2.52,2.52,2.52,1.924,2.52

UNBELIEVABLE...the place has gotten even worse!!! The food was edible, but not really good (bland). The wait we endured to get it was ridiculous (seriously, almost 40 minutes for fried green beans and a 1/2 plate of skins). The service is ABSOLUTELY IMPLORABLE! I arrived to find 4 patrons at the bar, two small bar tables taken, and the restaurant side less than 1/4 full - this was NOT a busy place. I waited almost 10 minutes sitting at a bar high-top while the bartender and one other server walked by me 2 times each without acknowledging me before one took my drink order. My buddies showed up about 10 minutes later and WAITED JUST AS LONG FOR DRINK ORDERS TO BE TAKEN! All 3 beers EMPTY for over 5 minutes before the server came by to ask if we wanted another round. If you decide to go here anyway, fill out an application to work as a waiter - by the time you have drinks and eat you will be an expert at waiting. Never, ever again at this Fridays.

We have stopped at this TGI Friday's a few times for a drink and a snack. After a day of running errands, it seemed like a good place for some respite. After all, we were just in the area.  This time, we walked in. The staff is always reasonably friendly. There is always room for one more at the bar. I still enjoy the atmosphere. Then I reviewed the menu and remembered that this just isn't a place that I enjoy.  I have tried most of the items on the appetizer menu and they were just ok.

That being said, with low expectations Friday's fell WAY short on this visit.  Issue #1- ""the computers are down so you can't order anything"" Soooo how come the 3 people that just walked in are able to sit down and get drinks and we are not? Either everyone can't get served or they can? Can we see your manager? Manager never came computers were up about 30 min later. While sure problems happen, the behavior and how they dealt with it was extremely poor.  Issue #2- They were out of EVERYTHING! It was absolutely ridiculous. No drums (wings) and the flaps look liked all the chickens rode the short bus.. they were hardly what you would expect....., no Bud light the most popular beer in America? No spinach dip, no rye bread so you can order a sandwich... I'm sorry did you have a private party for 1000 people yesterday or do your managers just not know how to order anything? Issue #3- Service. Sure there are problems, things happen, but if I didn't have bud light and my computers went down for 30 minutes and there were only 6 tables in the whole building I would stop by every table and at least say I'm sorry. And If I'm the server I will be available every second that my table needs me, especially seeing how there are less than 20 people in the building. Friday's failed on both.

70,Tom A.,"Long Beach, CA",12,30,1.0,1.0,2013-12-25,"OK, I've come to understand that when you get bad service in a restaurant, only a portion of the blame can be directed at the server. After all, servers are generally only going to do as well as they've been trained to do. And when things go wrong, as some things apparently did on this visit, how they handle that will again be based on what they've been trained to do when things go wrong. That said, here's how my visit this evening went: I went in as a solo diner; the place was about half-full. I sat for at least 10 minutes, maybe closer to 15, before my server appeared to take my order. I expected my salad to come out soon after that, but 20 minutes later it hadn't arrived. My entree came out, but not my salad. I finished my entree completely, and still no salad. After waiting for probably another 10 minutes, I finally stopped my server as he went by and asked if I'd be getting my salad any time soon. He apologized, made a comment about problems in the kitchen (which I heard him mention to other customers), and went back to the kitchen. A few minutes later he re-appeared with my salad, which I'd ordered now nearly 45 minutes earlier.  I finished eating, paid my bill, and then found that I'd been shorted on my change. I was shorted only 34 cents so I wasn't going to make an issue of it. By that time I just wanted to leave and get home. Oh, yeah; the food was adequate.

I hate going places and happy hour is $1 off pizza, $3 domestic beers (that's how much they should be anyway), and $4 well cocktails. No, friends. TGI Friday's happy hour menu provides enough options to enjoy your post work shenanigans. Unless you're a crazy health nut person, but if that's the case you shouldn't be here anyway.

Place was pretty dead when we got here around 8:45pm.  Sat at the booth in the bar and ordered a couple of drinks.  We were full from our dinner but when you happen to ""Check-In"" to this place, it states that you can get a free appetizer.  When we showed our server, she said that this deal was only up to $8.  Well they should state that on the yelp thing of course but that was okay, because we were still a bit hungry after our dinner.  We were all craving sweets so each of us got a dessert as well.  We ordered Loaded Skillet Chip Nachos ($9.89)Home-style potato chips with melted cheese and bacon crumbles, stacked in a skillet and smothered in white cheddar queso. Garnished with more bacon crumbles and green onions.  Hmmmm sounded good but it was just way too salty!!  Made me want to have a heart attack!  This thing was super heavy and made me feel sick after a couple of bites.

Tennessee Whiskey Cake: A warm toffee cake topped with glazed pecans and vanilla ice cream. Served with butterscotch Jack Daniel's® Whiskey sauce.  Very moist and rich as well!  LOVE IT! Washington Apple martini ($7.99)-  Love it!  Super strong!

Every time the service has gotten worse and worse. I really don't like making bad reviews but I feel if this place wants to stay in business, it needs to straighten up a bit. Every single time we have come, there always seems to be some adjustment made to the endless appetizers which we always get. it's supposed to be like 10 bucks or something, but they always come back with the bill saying we shared or got the ""premium"" appetizers when we didn't. $10? No, no. More like a $24 dollar bill. For appetizers microwaved in the back and take 20 minutes to come out to you each time which they consider premium, keep in mind. Last time we went there was kind of the final straw. The waitress started off by giving us all the stink eye when we mentioned we wanted the bill split prior to ordering. Just so we could save the trouble, you know? She looked at us like we were dumb. That was pretty rude, first of all. Service was slow as hell throughout the whole time we were there. She comes back with our bills not split like we asked. We correct her, she finally splits it. Due to our previous experience in getting overcharged for apparently ordering premium appetizers, we were sure not to do that. The bill said we did and we argued that we didn't. Our waitress argued that she has it written down that that is what we ordered. Okay? She could have written anything on that piece of paper. Just because she misheard us doesn't mean we ordered premium appetizers.  We are fed up, we pay and leave. Friend goes back in because he forgot his debit card. Oh weird, she doesn't seem to know where it went. We follow them around, talk to the manager and wait around for 15 minutes. Lo and behold, there's the card that she ""found on the ground.""

Upon entering, two hostesses were there, to greet me. I find that crucial, as I dine out often and like to feel welcomed and valued, as a paying customer. I was sat in Lauren's section. She acknowledged me, within a reasonable time frame, and started drink orders immediately.  I love this menu. It's colorful, organized, expansive, has assorted photos, AND LISTS CALORIE COUNTS!  I loved that I had several choices, at creating a healthy dinner option, that could keep me under 500 calories! I could even sample an appetizer (up to $8 free, with a Yelp check-in) and add a beer (Michelob Ultra) and still feel great about my plan to control what I eat.

Once we came in around 9:30pm and sat in the bar area, after 15 minutes we actually called on the phone to ask for a server, 5 minutes later one arrived and we placed our drink order, 10 minutes later we left with out having a drink or food. On Thursday we went and had a great experience, very cold beer, nice hot food and a full rack of ribs for $10.99. We were happy... Today 7/30/16 we went there for dinner the $10.99 ribs and bourbon chicken were sounding good, much to our surprise, we were told that the ribs were only at the corporate stores, after speaking to the manager she also told us they wouldn't do the ribs for that price. We couldn't get a cold beer on tap because of a refrigeration problem, so once again we left frustrated and disappointed. TGI Fridays - this store is problematic, franchised or not, we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=80,1.84,1.91,1.91,2.02,1.8820000000000001

He was attentive and helpful and prompt,  we never had to look for him.  We sat at a bar table last night and my husband got to watch the sports.  The bar area is very nice, I prefer it to a booth in the dining area.  I believe it is the energy in there, it feels good.  Over the last 10 years I've been frequenting here, when there has been a minor issue, the management is quick to rectify the situation and make things right.  No business can be perfect all the time, humans work there!  I recommend this restaurant highly,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda,2.36,1.9,1.9,,2.084

But then again she is a waitress and should have focused on customer service rather than her own feelings.  The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was because after we finally got our food it was not bad.

He just kept on walking. No apology. Not even a smile on his face. So we all sat down and waited about 10 minutes just to get the menus. The table still wasn't cleaned at all. Another 20 minutes goes by and nothing...we don't see anyone come by to see if we needed anything at all.
