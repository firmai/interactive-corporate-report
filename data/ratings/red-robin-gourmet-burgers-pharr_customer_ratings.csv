32,Cayenne C.,"League City, TX",46,118,9.0,1.0,2013-07-02,"This place has really gone downhill. They used to have really good burgers and drinks. I hadn't been there in a while--went back--& had a tasteless burger and disgusting cocktail. The waiter said that there was no bartender, so he made the Margarita. 2/3 cheap tequila & 1/3 cheap mixer--no. And charged for a ""top-shelf"" drink. No again. So we gave it a rest, and went back last weekend. After about a year.  Got the new ""Wolverine"" movie inspired burger (don't remember the name), & one of their new ""beer cocktails"" & my husband dared to try another of their Margaritas.  OMG this was BAD. Inedible bad. The burger I had was completely flavorless, in spite of being touted as spicy with ""sriracha onions"".  I've never seen my husband, in almost 25 years, push a cocktail to the side & leave it. He had ordered the ""riblets"", & we did share a laugh as we tried to determine the origin of the said ""riblets"", finally deciding it must be a tie between either rat or possum ""riblets"". The waitress did inquire as to the flavor of my beer cocktail--& didn't seem too surprised when I compared it to drinking hairspray. Never again, Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pharr?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

35,Don T.,"Mission, TX",4,14,35.0,1.0,2014-03-09,"Worst burger restaurant I've ever been to! Worst restaurant I've been to, period. The service was deplorable! Normally I would give slack about service, seeing as I'm a waiter myself, but the service my party received was beyond forgiveness, every single thing that could have gone wrong did! And when we tried to bring it up with the manager she refused to at least apologize and when we made our feelings known she (Amanda) yelled at us, humiliating my party in the middle of the crowded restaurant! Unbelievable. She even called the police because we ""refused to pay"" despite the fact that some of us were already done paying or were in the process of paying out meals. When the police man came he was completely baffled because there was no crime committed, what a waste of pharr p.d's time! I mean honestly she was a real bitch! I hate to say it but there isn't another way of putting it. Never going back again and I will denounce the name of Red Robins as long as I live. The burgers were lackluster as well.

The bottomless brocolli is such a great option, but in spite of the fact that I tell them to make it the bigger bowl, they always give me a cup! So I end up asking and waiting for multiple cups!

24,Lou Lou O.,"McAllen, TX",5,80,437.0,2.0,2016-01-31,This place is what I consider wasted potential (or  untapped potential if you are an optimist). The food is good but not so superior that I want to return. Our waited was really lost so either he is new or not very good. He mixed up my order several times and that is one of my pet peeves from a restaurant (the other one is hot food that is served cold).

5,Charlie W.,"McAllen, TX",107,58,80.0,1.0,2016-12-01,"We came here for a late lunch and the place wasn't busy at all. I'll start with the positive aspects I experienced. First was the service, it was very good and the waitress was very attentive and quick on refills and to bring the check. She was also patient while we looked at the menu. Second they have gluten free buns which was a big plus for my wife. It's hard to find a place with good gluten free options.  Now for the downsides of this place. The quality is terrible. It's not really that good, just rather blah. Also it's definitely over priced for quality and size. Burgers aren't very big or thick and the meat is terrible. Prices are definitely too high for the mediocre taste. Also, we came in with a 50% off coupon and it was only honored on one burger, when the coupon clearly stated per table and not per order. This is rather misleading marketing on their part just to get people in the door. Integrity matters so I would NOT recommend this place or come back. If you want a good gourmet burger at a decent price, I recommend Tower Burger in Alamo. Don't waste your money on this place for sub par taste.

We had a birthday party planned so we couldn't use the tickets until Sunday. We go online to activate the card to get the ticket we get a notice that the ticket will be sent to us in 72 hours. Unacceptable!! Today we return to the same location only to be told they couldn't refund the charge and the general manger Alex was not kind at all.

Better yet, they are bottomless, meaning that you can have all you can eat fries. The burgers are sizable and you can have them cooked to order. My personal favorite is the Royal Red Robin which comes with an egg inside. The egg is sunny side up but can be made to your liking.  The burgers are customizable as well. I usually remove all veggies, add bacon, and ask for extra mustard. My wife takes advantage of the create-your-own burger if you don't fancy any of the already named burgers on the menu.  For a lighter on calories drink, try their peach tea, which is only 15 calories per drink. For a super great drinkable dessert, try their root beer floats. The root bear floats are one of the few uniq e bottomless drinks the menu offers, which means that you can drink all the root beer floats that you want.

She did ask if everything was ok, but didn't return. We were finally approached by who I'd guess was the floor manager. He asked how thing were and we asked for a refill on our salads. He left and our salads were brought fairly soon. Our serve showed up between time and we let her know we already spoken and asked for more salad.
