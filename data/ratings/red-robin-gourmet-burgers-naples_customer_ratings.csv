29,Arlene H.,"Naples, FL",324,130,336.0,4.0,2014-11-25,"Confessions of a foodie:  I couldn't say ""Red Robin"" without saying ""YUMMMM"".  Those psychological marketeers will definitely get you! So, today was the second day of their opening and business at lunch was in full throttle.  I initially didn't have high expectations, as I usually don't for chains, but I was pretty doggone impressed with how they handle the busy workflow and continue to throw in their spiel.  Our waitress, Maya, was exceptional.  She shared her passion for the place by telling us about the text rewards program (and even walked through the steps with some not-so-techy people in my company), special items that might be of interest and general direction in navigating through such an extensive menu and also shared from personal experience without being too wordy.  She seemed to be quite the natural and not just rehearsed.  A manager quickly also came on hand with our request to know what the ""freckled"" fruit salad had in it.  It was a nice added touch, as I'm sure that there was still time for wait staff to get acclimated to the minutia of their menu. All of these little details add up to make or break an overall customer experience, and when communication is natural, it gets noticed. The venue had a casual, but whimsical rock and roll feel with revamped types of memorabilia and a bar that had a light fixture using all beer bottles.  There were plenty of booths, and even tables that had these red leather chairs. In the hostess area, held a chalkboard wall and two burger-type ottomans.  Super cute. I think that this restaurant is a step up from the former Applebee's.  The place looks clean with hopes that it'll stay pristine, and from panning across the restaurant while rudely taking pictures for Yelp, the patrons seemed to be in good moods all across.  I truly applaud their efforts, and I have high hopes that this place will do well in and out of season.  I'm just thankful to be able to experience Red Robin in Naples as a standalone restaurant instead of having to deal with the craziness of the Fort Myers location. As for my food? I had a bleu ribbon burger with endless steak fries.  One round of fries was plenty.  My burger had fried onion strings, chipotle aioli, and blue cheese on an onion bun.  No need to explain how awesome it was cuz you know you want one.

24,Lissete D.,"Miami, FL",283,558,220.0,4.0,2014-12-31,"Driving around with a grumbly tummy and looking for a quick lunch. We are not local, but are in Naples frequently. I spotted this Red Robin and suddenly had  a craving for a mushroom burger. I know that this was not there when we last visited. It turns out that they had just opened 3 days earlier. I usually do not like to visit a restaurant during the first few weeks of opening. Work out the kinks and all. But they were all, for the most part, on point here.  The staff was friendly. Our server was knowledgeable. And the food was just like we're used to. We did order a refill on our fries that never showed up. But maybe that was a good thing. ;) All in all, a great visit. Happy to have another casual option in Naples.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-naples,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997

The game was on I was in the mood for a good hamburger and they had them both. The downside was the service. I went on a Sunday night and the place didn't look very busy however we had to wait for a table and it didn't get better. We asked our server several times for napkins before finally getting them. We had to ask for refills. My wife's wine glass came equipped with some one else's lipstick on it GROSS. The server was a polite nice women but we had to grab her and tell her what to do for anything to get done.

After an hour of drinking some beers and talking, it turns out the bartender never even put our orders in. We were waiting for food that was never coming. Horrible experience especially for my birthday. The real cherry on top was people sitting across from the bar that came in after us and had the same bartender and got their food before us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-naples?start=20,,,,,
2,Joe M.,"Bonita Springs, FL",4,2,,5.0,2015-05-18,Had a great time at Red Robin. Quick bar service. Got a small portion of sweet potato fries and bartender went and got another side of fries.

9,Renee l.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,2015-08-13,"Im not usually a bad reviewer, so excuse my tone: My experience was more than interesting. The wonderful little hostess welcomed us promtly upon arrival (party of 2), seated us in the ""less busy"" low table about-faced on the bar side. Our server, whom I believe was doubling as a bartender (with zero customers at the bar AND a bar-back to assist with alcoholic beverages to be made for the restaurant..) greeted us, took our order within a few minutes. All was well as we ordered our bottomless steak fries and two burgers. Ordering our second basket minutes later took some time as our server frantically ran from her stationed tables in her section. We accepted her as overwhelmed with her 3 [4.. tops] tables, so we overlooked the fact we had no silverware or napkins, resorting to the paper offered in the bathroom. I'd have to say we were fair with our patience, arriving at 7:07; seated near immediately; attended to at 7:10 (roughly); and then COMPLETELY IGNORED until 7:46PM. At which we decided it was best to just wander on out. It didn't appear that our foods' order had been placed, (I figured that may have jogged our servers' memory) but alas, the food; nor the server came our way. But instead the high top table RIGHT NEXT TO US was attended to frequently.. even asked repeatedly if they would like more fries; at which they declined. (While our basket sat empty at the edge of the table, which I believe is socially acceptable for proper etiquette when finishing something.) Perhaps being a party of four and not two younger adults weighed more important. So, as our waitress approached our neighbors with her back COMPLETELY turned to our table as if we insulted her mother.. for the last time at 7:46PM, is when we chose the Brooks gourmet burger joint 5 to 8 minutes (depending on traffic) South of this Red Robin location. As far as the identity of our server, all I can say on that is that she was a fair skinned woman with dark hair.. a long bob with a pinned back bang. I would loved to have given a name, but she wasn't around long enough for me to catch it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-naples?start=20,,,,,
27,Tim P.,"Bonita Springs, FL",0,13,,1.0,2015-08-23,Could not get waited on after we were seated. Servers kept walking by our table and completely ignored us. Left without eating went to another restaurant where they wanted customers.  The management do not care about how they treat their customers. Do yourself a favor and skip eating here. You can see a pattern with other reviewers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-naples,,,,,

4,cheri t.,"Haverhill, MA",6,225,,1.0,2015-10-06,"I ate here on Sunday night and words cannot explain how bad our experience was at this Red Robin location.  The food and service was horrendous.  We all ordered burgers and they were overcooked, lacking the requisite items and all appeared as if they sat under the heating lamp for a long time.  The cooks should be embarrassed sending such items out of the kitchen.  They skimp to the extreme on the burgers, nothing we ordered looked anywhere near the pictures on the menu.  We have been to many Red Robin and have never been disappointed until now.  DO NOT go here for a burger there are soo many other places that are better than this place. As for service, I don't even have the energy to go into how bad it was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-naples?start=20,,,,,
10,Cam S.,"Naples, FL",0,8,,1.0,2015-10-19,"Today 10/19/2015 - 1:15 pm The service was less than expected. When we walked in, a lady leaving said, "" I hope your service was better than ours."" I asked our waitress which was better between 2 burgers, & rather than say , ""this one sells more than the other or Vise-versa, she let me know SHE...DIDN'T EAT MEAT! Oh.... Okay. Well, I don't like vegetables, but could steer someone in the right direction (especially in front of children). THEN when the bill came (45 minutes later), I had an ENTERTAINMENT FEE of $1.99??? I asked the server and she explained it was the little Computer Gizmo on the table (which my 10 year old grabbed & I never looked at). I now understand it stated if you want to play apps/games there is a $1.99 charge. I then spoke to the Manager on duty, Chris. Although I showed him I had an iPad with us & had I understood the rules (maybe explained my the server), My children would have used what we brought for FREE. Chris, the Manager refused to remove the $1.99 charge and said, ""It could not be done nor could removing a milk shake or soft drink."" He also stated, ""some people just get mad and leave and we then take it to another level."" I said, ""are you making a threat to me?"" He of course said, ""no."" I have NEVER had an issue with the Fort Myers location by the airport and have now had 2 bad experiences in the Naples location. I believe we will get our burgers elsewhere. Thanks, Chris (Manager) for making this a positive visit! With the 2 1/2 star on Google & Yelp, I'm surprised anyone would ever go.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-naples?start=20,,,,,
0,Pepito H.,"Hialeah, FL",91,12,,5.0,2015-10-21,"I have to commend the staff and especially the managers for having to put up with certain individuals who come into their restaurant to eat. First the food is outstanding at this Red Robins. I have yet to have an ok or bad burger at this place. Second the staff as well as the management team is outstanding and a breath of fresh air when it comes to restaurants. They are very attentive, always around if you need anything and overall very helpful with the needs of the clients. I was there a few days ago when an individual was making the life of a server along with the manager a living hell. There is no need to disgrace yourself and make employee's feel like crap because you did not get what you wanted and or expected. If you treat others with kindness maybe you'll get that back in return. If you get up on the wrong side of the bed, take it out on your husband or family, not on those who have nothing to do with your personal life.  This restaurant is one of the best in Naples for burgers and beer. Anyone on their staff may have a day off and the experiences here could be different for you, yet overall, they deserve a four to five star for overall satisfaction all of the time for the overall experience you will receive. At least from my own personal experiences and opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-naples?start=20,,,,,

Fries were cold, came without the dressing. Waited for onion soup forever because they made it with bread when I asked for gluten free. Finally came but had hard, uncooked onions inside. Tasteless broth. Hamburger did not list cheese in menu, so it took forever to redo the order. Slow service, food not worth the wait. Over $30 later, for only two people, one didn't have an entree...

18,Chef N.,"Naples, FL",0,48,,4.0,2016-07-16,"Red Robin puts out a pretty good burger and all around menu. They and Brooks Gormet Burgers (the absolute best burger) are the two places we enjoy the most for a burger and fries. They have all you can eat fries (they excel here over Brooks IMO) - normally served hot. My wife enjoys the campfire sauce with her fries - it is tasty for sure.  Their milk shakes are pretty good too - but Brooks IMO excels here - especially on their glazed donut shake.  Their restaurant is clean and normally good for families. The staff is attentive. The manager also is attentive. They have some great coupons. Burger ratings for us: The Very Best: 1. Brooks Gourmet (if you desire an excellent shake too) 2.
