Rhonda E.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,53,14,5.0,7/26/2015,"We took our nephews there for dinner on a Saturday night. Town Center was hopping, so we expected a long wait. Actually, it only took about 25 minutes....not too bad.  The hostesses were super friendly, and even came outside to let us know that our table was ready. Our server was Chaz. FABULOUS!!! Extremely friendly & patient!  We started off with white corn guacamole & chips. It was wonderful.  One nephew got the jambalaya fettuccine. Little spicy, but very tasty. I got the four cheese ravioli with sautéed mushrooms. OMG. Melt in your mouth goodness! The rest of our group got pizzas- meat cravers ( huge pieces of meat) , Margherita, and Thai (lots of crunchy veggies on top).  The food, the service & the atmosphere made for a great night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40
Morgan H.,"Jacksonville, FL",51,337,830,4.0,4/21/2014,"I really enjoy eating at the bar at CPK b/c I love watching them work.  My husband and I commented that they really know what they are doing here as far as operations go and you can tell they run like a well oiled machine. Man were they cranking out the food in record time on Saturday during lunch.  We stopped in for a quick bite while out shopping and I let mister pick what we ordered. He went with the California Club on thin crust. (this particular pizza isn't normally offered on thin crust but you can have any of them made on thin crust for $1.50 more)  The pizza tasted great, but my only complaint would be that there were too many toppings piled on so it was rather difficult to eat.  All in all I think CPK is one of the better places to stop in for a quick yet delicious lunch if you're out walking around the Town Center Mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40
Matt M.,"Jacksonville, FL",131,542,1012,4.0,4/2/2013,"I like California Kitchen, but I cannot say that I love it or look forward to eating there for months in advance.  I know everyone talks about how great it is, but in the Towncenter it is not my first choice for great food nor is it my second. However, after clarifying my personal opinions, CK is a good dining spot.  Service is always prompt and proffesional, food is consitently good and I often think consistency is one of the most important ingredients to a successful restaurant.  I guess I have just not found that ""wow"" item on the menu that I really love, but my family sure has and they love going there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40
Danielle K.,"Jacksonville, FL",26,61,20,4.0,1/15/2016,If your looking for a great choice for gluten free pizza this is the place to go.

Valerian L.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,18,15,4.0,12/5/2014,"The last time I went to CPK, I had a less-than-satisfactory experience. The food was either salty or just didn't taste like it was described as. This time, however I had an experience that signified a significant improvement at this location. Don't get me wrong, I actually loved CPK. There was this brilliant location about 15 minutes from my old home in Southern California, where you had a view that would rival those experienced by Marco Polo in Asia. The food there was certainly on par for the price bracket and it's a shame that I haven't been there in seven years. I visited CPK's Jacksonville location about four times since its opening and found it underwhelming. Obviously, since it was CALIFORNIA Pizza Kitchen, and not FLORIDA Pizza Kitchen, you would expect the highest quality establishments to be concentrated around the chain's area of origin. (This is something that most chain businesses should avoid doing yet it seems to be a recurring pattern with some.) Tonight I went to California Pizza Kitchen again, having received a call from my father who invited me to join him and my mother. He just got 100 dollars worth of gift cards for CPK and I thought that my brother, sister and I could join them.        The location itself was chosen when the Saint John's Town Centre was in no shortage of open real estate in prime locations. (CPK is located near the ever-so-popular Turtle Pond, sharing a circle with Starbucks, Teavana and Maggiano's Little Italy. It's hard to get such openings in the main area of the TC unless you're a multi-billion dollar company that can commission an entire new complex for you're store. I'm looking at you,Nordstrom.) As a result of this, CPK usually gets plenty of customers. (At least more than its neighbour: ""The Art of Shaving"" would ever get.) On an occasion, CPK can have 90+ minute waiting lists. We caught the place on a nice, quiet, meaningless Friday, which allowed us to enjoy our meal in the quiet, serene setting. We had Avacado Chicken Rolls as an appetiser. The crunchy wonton-like shell blended with the warm, flavourful filling. Which contained tomatoes, bacon and chicken. It was served with a spicy, creamy sauce and a non-spicy sauce of the same texture. For our entrée, we had three varieties of pizza: Habanero Carnitas, a soft- crusted pizza with a ""habanero element"" that wasn't actually as spicy as a real habanero pepper, but still enjoyable due to its well seasoned pork. Chipotle Chicken, a pizza with a semi-thick crust, which like the Habanero Carnitas, shares Mexican influence. The Chipotle Chicken featured tender grilled chicken, a seasoning that actually made it spicier than the Habanero Carnitas, and a Pico de Gallo topping. The pizza is served with a spicy chipotle sauce on the side that is sure to add a nice kick. Lastly we had the ""Pear+Gorgonzola"" a thin-crusted, crunchy masterpiece. The Pear+Gorgonzola, (which I will call the PG) was not only delicious due to the overall execution of the recipe, but the idea itself. CPK dared to experiment with unlikely ideas, and created one of the best slices of Pizza I have eaten. (It sits right up there some of the stuff that comes out of Libretto's, my all-time-favourite pizzeria.)    The PG is a sweet, yet slightly sour pizza, which is served as a regular pizza with Gorgonzola Cheese, which gives it the strong, Blue Cheese type flavour. The PG also includes some sliced pears, which taste like very delicious pears, and add to the sweetness of the pizza. There are some herbs and stuff, and the whole thing's served below a bed of salad with more Gorgonzola. I suppose what made the PG so spectacular is the flavour contrast, which was a risky move for CPK, yet one most rewarding. The meal overall was the highlight of my day. I think it is safe to say that California Pizza Kitchen, to me has redeemed itself. 4.8/5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40
Mandie M.,"Jacksonville, FL",483,376,925,4.0,11/16/2014,"My first taste of CPK was during a short port call in Hawaii. A friend of mine said it was a must stop for dinner, especially if we had never eaten there. It's been a long time since then, just over seven years, but CPK finally made their debut in Jacksonville a few years ago. I, typically, visit CPK on Veteran's Day. This is because of all the chain restaurants around town, I can get in and get out fairly quickly by choosing to sit at the bar rather than a table. Given that our CPK is located in the St. John's Town Center, this is quite the miracle.   Although, I haven't come to CPK and actually sat down on at a table, I know my opinion is fairly limited. It is, however, disappointment-free. I'm very happy that CPK has the option of sitting at the bar. If they didn't, they would probably turn away a ton of customers. The folks, like myself, who want to get in for a quick bite are just as important as the family of five. The other great part about the bar is being able to watch the employees construct meals and to see that huge brick oven.  I had a slight annoyance during my last visit to CPK, but it was nothing to do with the employees. I had to work on Veteran's Day and went to CPK for my lunch. The bar had a few empty seats, but not enough for this party of five (a mother and four teenage girls) that walked straight to the back. The entire group continually hovered over everyone at the bar, tried to get folks to move down from where they were seated (which wouldn't give enough seats for their whole party anyways) and were very rude. Finally, the waitress in charge of the bar area asked them to leave and profusely apologized to all of us that were sitting. She told us to take our time and eat and not let ourselves be rushed. I'm glad that the waitress had enough care to handle the situation before it got way out of hand.   As I only seem to make it over to the Town Center sparingly, and usually not to eat, I haven't tried anything else on CPK's menu other than pizza. Of the pizzas that I have had, I haven't been disappointed. The ingredients harken back to my time in Sicily and the crust is perfectly cooked. Given my New England roots, I have been spoiled by great Italian food, especially pizza, all my life. CPK is right up there with some of the best from back home for me. I see a few fellow Yelpers drawing a comparison between CPK and Mellow Mushroom. I don't feel that the comparison is fair. The styles of each chain are very different. For myself, I can tell the difference between a pizza from CPK and a pizza from Mellow and I like both. Each style of pizza has its own unique qualities.  I do need to actually go and enjoy a sit down meal. Now that I have my new job just a few minutes up the road on Beach Blvd, I'm sure that I can conquer that task in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40

Sarah B.,"Sahuarita, AZ",73,17,15,3.0,7/23/2015,"Being a chain restaurant, there is only so much I can say for different locations other than report on the hospitality. We ordered the white pizza which has ricotta cheese, spinach, mozzarella, and garlic. I usually have a decent experience but at this location I didn't feel that our waitress made any attempt to establish a connection or short lived friendship with us. She was not very nice and didn't seem to have any input/recommendations when we were still struggling with what to order and asking questions. It was not busy so it was not that she did not have the time. We also noted that she seemed to be rushing us out.

Foodie S.,"Wheeling, IL",10,66,63,3.0,9/11/2015,"Alright, let me confess this first. I love California Pizza Kitchen and I am obsessed with it. I was visiting Florida from Maryland and there is no way I'd miss trying any CPK in my way. Food is good as always. Service is great. But,3 star because, one of the reasons I go to CPK every week is for their food which includes the warm bread they serve with olive oil (yummm) And when I went to this place, I was really hungry as we were driving from MD to FL and tired from the shopping I couldn't resist doing in the mall this place is in. So, naturally I wanted to pounce on the bread before I got my food and they literally brought 3 pieces of bread for a table of 3 people !!!!

They were super busy since they recently opened and it was a little frustrating to have to wait when there were no stores open to meander through, but it was worth the wait.  We started with the white bean guacamole. It was different & refreshing and got our taste buds prepared for what was to come. My husband ordered a sandwich while I stuck to the must-have pizza.

Naomi B.,"Orange Park, FL",857,115,534,4.0,6/9/2013,"Yes, I know it's a chain, but it's one of the very FEW chains that I've fancied since back in the day. Andddd the busiest CPK location in the US? Yup...Hawaii (there's only 1 CPK). I was surprised our server (Jordan) this evening knew that. However, truth be told, I actually like the St. Johns Town Center location much better as far as size (larger) and atmosphere (fresh and fancy). We arrived later in the evening for dinner (around 7 p.m.), and though the place was hoppin', we were seated well within 5 minutes. I love the ""chill mode"" vibe here. Lights were dimmed, staff was polite and welcoming, swanky ultra modern decor that was easy on the eyes...all made for a very delightful visit. Food: I ordered a starter of mediterranean focaccia bread off their ""small plates"" menu to share with mom and family friend. The bread had cheese and herbs baked in, and was very delish when dipped in the olive oil and parmesan. Soon after, my all-time fave, the White Pizza (mozzarrela, ricotta, parmesan, pecorino romano,sauteed spinach, and roasted garlic) was set before me. I love, love, LOVE this pizza. Cheesy crusty goodness, and the touch of garlic fuses everything together. Never a disappointment.  Mom went with the California Veggie Pizza (baby broccoli, eggplant, corn, red onions, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella, and tomato sauce), and requested a whole wheat crust. She said it was very flavorful, but she had hoped that there would be more of an abundance of veggies on her pizza, that they were pretty scattered. Family friend...based on a recommendation from our server...had the mac n cheese. I had a couple bites and thought it was very good and not artificial-tasting. She liked it as well, but wanted a deeper and more prominent cheese flavor.  Service: Spot on from the get-go, thank you, Jordan. Great, positive demeanor, and knowledgeable of menu items and ingredients. Drinks never went empty, and food was fresh and delicious. I'll definitely be back in the near future to try the patio seating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=60

I discreetly told the server and she did apologize and replaced the pizza.  What I am most upset no one from management  came over to apologize or ask if everything was ok. I did call their guest services number and my information and received a call from a female employee who did not identify herself. Her response was uncaring and arrogant and stated we replaced your pizza. My point is that they should have apologized to keep me as a customer. Even when I called their corporate office their regional gave me lipservice after explaining the situation. I stated all I wanted was and apology and it would be a nice token to give something to win back my business after the biggest faux pas in the food business. I am a graduate from the Art Institute in Culinary Management  to be a chef.   Wish you guys would learn that its cheaper to keep a regular customer then gain a new one..  I""m also a MBA student so I'm not talking out the side of my neck.

Anne-Marie B.,"Houston, TX",171,234,121,2.0,7/15/2012,"I would like to preface this review by acknowledging that this was the first time I'd visited this location. I am open to trying it again, as I realize there is at least one crap server at every restaurant...my server was exceptionally incompetent at CPK. I tend to surround myself with a pretty attractive group of ladies. Never did I imagine that this would be to my detriment. On this visit, there were 4 of us dining. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was our server's first serving job, and he must have been new. If you don't know how to manage a lunch rush, the least you can do is acknowledge your inability to do your job. That way, at least your table knows you know the exist. Apparently this guy had a soft spot in his heart for Italians (much to my dismay, as one of the women dining with us was full-blooded Sicilian). Once he finally showed up to the table, he went out of his way to accommodate ONE person at the table...the saucy Italian. Great. All I wanted was a water. Just a water. Is it too much to ask to refill my water, along with the Italian's, when they're both empty? We're in FLORIDA in the middle of SUMMER. This is not a tall request.  We sat for an excessively long time after being greeted, so when he was walking by, I politely asked if we could place our order and he scoffed and explained to me that he had several tables and he was working as fast as he could. Sorry bro, doesn't work for me. I've been in your shoes an I know how this is supposed to go. Considering he'd visited all his other tables around us TWICE already, I wasn't sympathetic, and decided it was our turn.  Bad move. He literally ignored my drink for the entire meal. The Italian (and no one else) was accommodated prior to her even requesting things. The best part was, after chewing on ice to make the point that I was clearly being neglected, he turned to the saucy Italian and asked her if she'd like a water to go.  I honestly couldn't tell you what I ordered, how it tasted, what the restaurant even looked like. All I saw was red.  As I said before, I will give this place another chance if the opportunity ever presents itself, but rest assured my first order of business will be to point the server out to the hostess that will NOT be taking care of me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=60

Jenni T.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",5,37,,4.0,9/29/2011,"So I've been here three times and they haven't disappointed me yet.  Yes, I know it's another chain, but sometimes you just want to go somewhere where you know everyone in the family will find something to be happy with.   Plus if you just don't want to leave that part of the Town Center to go eat somewhere else, the wait is a lot less than at P.F. Chang's and Cheesecake Factory.   I am in LOVE with their fish tacos.   Yeah, I'm weird that way, going to a pizza place for the fish tacos.  But they're so tasty!  The cabbage is sometimes a little hard, but I love the sauce they put on it, and the fish itself has a nice flavor.  I did stray once and got the Italian sandwich.  Good sized portion, with lots of meat, but I didn't like the slaw.  My daughter got the white pizza and didn't like it because t had spinach on it, but that's a personal preference, there was nothing wrong with the pizza itself.  Plus she's spoiled from the white pizza at Moon River in Fernandina.  As am I.  The Mediterranean plate appetizer/small plate is also very good.  I could lick that hummus off the plate if people wouldn't stare.

The mushroom, sausage, pepperoni had great ingredients but lacked enough toppings and cheese. It was too dry without cheese and could have used a bit more sauce. Our bill was $68 before the tip.

The flyer indicated that on Nov. 28th, 20% of our bill went to the American Cancer Society's UNF Relay for Life fundraising effort. We had not dined in this California Pizza Kitchen before but had enjoyed two previous visits to the location in Waterford Lakes (Orlando), FL. We were not disappointed! Our server, Dean, was courteous, prompt, and anticipated our every request. This fella was a top-notch server. We ordered the Crispy Mac n' Cheese for an appetizer, which was delicious and the perfect size (four small samples for $3.75). Another in the party enjoyed the Dakota pea soup, which smelled heavenly. Two shared a Sicilian pizza which was loaded with Italian meats, and quite ample for $14. I enjoyed the Chicken Milanese for $15.50. It was three boneless chicken breasts dipped in panko bread crumbs and lightly fried, then topped with arugula and a tomato/olive oil concoction which was light and tasty. The cranberry cooler ($2.50) was a nice change from the usual drink of sweet tea (and included free refills), and hubs enjoyed a cappuccino ($4.25) after the meal. Since it was a fundraiser, we splurged on two scrumptious desserts to share. First was a warm butter cake ($6.25) that was out of this world delicious; the second was a chocolate souffle with Haagen Dazs ice cream -- yum, yum, yum (@ $7.75). We dined about 7 p.m. and expected a wait, but were seated immediately. There are many wonderful eatiers in the St. Johns Town Center, many are more pricey, but don't miss California Pizza Kitchen.

Kassie C.,"Jacksonville, FL",201,101,414,3.0,11/30/2015,"I have been to California pizza several times and this particular experience took place on Veteran's Day. It was very busy but no surprise there considering it was during the middle of the day for lunch. My bf & I sat at this little table right near the well at the bar. Not the greatest spot but for not having to wait I didn't have any complaints. The service was average, but not the greatest. I waited a while just to simply ask for napkins.  As far as the food, we ordered the pepperoni pizza and it was very good but extremely greasy. I definitely  dabbed probably 50 calories of grease off with my napkin. My main reason for giving 3 stars was because of the drink I ordered. I always get the Caribbean Sunset White Sangria which is always delicious but pricey almost $9. My frustration came as I was watching the bartender make it. I understand they are obligated to fill the entire glass up with ice..no big deal..but even with the ice the drink was barely over half filled. When I  questioned the bartender about it he said they are becoming more strict on how much they fill the drink up and the measuring. If you are going to give me half a drink maybe you should consider putting it in a lot smaller glass. I had it drank in literally 3 sips. Disappointing nonetheless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=20

Meghan H.,"Burlington, NJ",166,5,8,1.0,11/11/2017,Absolutely the worst service I've ever received. I used to work at a cpk and loved it there. This particular one was absolutely atrocious. The wait for me was supposed to be 30 min. Went to the bathroom and both toilets were broken and leaking toilet water all over the place. And they were absolutely disgusting. A truck stop gas station would of been better. Stood in the lobby waiting for my name to get called. Name was never called after 30 min so I asked the manager with the attitude where I was on the list. She told me they already called my name 15 minutes ago. And if they actually had they only said it once because every other persons name they yelled multiple times. So when I told the manager that I still wanted to eat. Instead of finding the next seat for us she put me at the end of her now 2 hour long list. I have never in all my years of working in food seen such absurdity. A man in a wheelchair got pushed out of the lobby because it was too busy and he took up too much room. This place and It's manager is horrendous and I hope no veteran ever goes to this place. Thy have no respect for their customers or their military. Most military members have hearing issues and to not try and accommodate them speaks volumes on the level of courtesy and respect they have.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=20

I expected a lot more than what I got for the price I paid.  *Everything was super bland, I'm not much of a cook but I could've made it better at home. We got the chicken & spinach pizza which had weird grainy things on the bottom of the crust. I got the garlic cream fettuccine and I couldn't taste anything but Parmesan cheese. The pasta was pretty dry and flavorless. There was very little chicken and it too was completely bland.  *The crust of the complimentary bread was very tough and chewy.

And I only say that because I've never been a big fan of them. But I decided to give them one last try. But everyone I've eaten this with love them.  I wasn't feeling my normal go to- the spinach artichoke pizza w chicken and avocado. It was just a lot of money to spend on a large pizza I'd only eat a slice of.  So I sided w a HALF chicken Thai salad w avocado, my fellow yelpers- a half is a full in my book. It was huge. I only was able to enjoy half. Hopefully the other half is good tomorrow.  I asked my husband how his jambalaya pasta was ""good"" lol. He's not very good at yelping.  Prices are a little steep. And by that I mean I paid $2.45 or .75 for avocado on my salad, and it's not even a full avocado just a handful of pieces.  I feel like I should also add that I HATE pizza, but I LOVE theirs...

I had the lunch BBQ chicken pizza with a Mediterranean salad. The pizza crust is a little chewy but tastes really good. The BBQ sauce is sweet with a hint of spice and the chicken was tender and flavorful. Together with a salad it makes a really nice lunch. Service was reasonable quick enough to be a workday lunch. The entrée salads look really good and there is a variety of pastas and even regular entrée meal such as steak and chicken as well.

I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and it was bland and not a very impressive portion given the price. Once I added enough salt to season the dish right, it tasted better and was pretty good. The noodles were cooked well but just not worth the $18 I paid after adding mushrooms.  My husbands pizza, or salad....honestly I don't know what exactly they were going for because it seemed like a dressed salad on top of a pizza crust which was just kinda confusing was okay. The salad itself was tasty but again for $15 the size wasn't impressive and I would be okay with a small size but it just wasn't amazing. Your better off going to mellow mushroom and getting an awesome pie there.  My daughters chicken breast off the kids meal was equally ""meh"".

Alex A.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",8,3,2,2.0,4/21/2017,"I have lived in Jacksonville, Florida for 10 years after moving here to escape the cold winters and overcrowded streets of New York City. I have had some of the best food NYC  had to offer. Now that I have been down here for sometime now, I think it time to give restaurants a honest review, because what passed down here for food at some of the trendious restaurants will not work up north.  My overall Rating for California Pizza is two stars. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice at the time of my visit.. If that is what I was here for I would have given then three stars the overall failing marks came with dinner style & quality utensils and dishes. I order the Garlic Chicken with vegetables. I also had the frozen lemonade to drink.  My lunch date ordered the Mahi mahi Tacos with a glass of Coca-Cola​. To sum up taste of the food, the vegetables were well cooked. The major flaw was the Garlic Chicken. The Chicken was flashed frozen and then cooked. The reason why I say the is because the chicken felt like I was eating a thin layer of chicken fat with rubber underneath it. The picture of the food is very deceiving. My drink was good. My lunch date said that her food was a better looking version of food from Taco bell. So it is sad to say the California Pizza Kitchen has the look and not the taste. They need a lot of important improvements to charge the $ for their food. My total bill was $45 and I would not be eating there anytime soon. They lacked in quality to justify their prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=20

Michael A.,"Jacksonville, FL",143,20,37,4.0,2/2/2016,"New year, new you??!!!  I enjoy this place for the two following reasons: 1) The pizza's calories are readily found on all major calorie trackers apps such as My Fitness Pal. This allows me to correctly track my macros each day.  Most pizza places do not have this options and tracking other pizza brands for calories isn't as accurate.   2) The pizza comes in a delicious single serving size. The OG Hawaiian Pizza is only a 1,200 calories compared to Little Caesars 2,500 calories for one pizza of similar size. With pizza that has this much flavor in a restaurant setting, it should be illegal!  I would recommend this place for people who are around the town center and do not want to over do it on the Carbs at ""that Italian restaurant"" there.  They have a wide arrange of food there that are not pizza as well. And, they have low/zero calorie drink options there as well.  While they are amazing, the avocado egg rolls will destroy your diet and weight loss. Avoid at all cost. Still with a single pizza as your cheat meal; you must avoid most of the appetizers at all cost!!!  The service is usually good there. The last time that I went there, I had a waitress named Michie. She was very polite and quick to help us with the menu. Overall, service there is great. It is only a few time in between shifts that things seem to not function as well. The older lady at the door who sits guest down somehow is always in the bathroom when people come in. IDK if she has a medical condition or what... but both times that I have seen her there... the same issues with customers walking in and no one being at the door was present.

It is a casual place with a cafe feel.  I am happy that I decided to try CPK for lunch instead of dinner because the restaurant seems large and fast-paced.   Service was very slow and there were menu items that were not available (ran out).  My husband's unsweet tea glass remained empty for several minutes.  We had to ask a different server to fill the glass because ours had disappeared.   Parties with strollers are asked to leave the stroller at the hostess stand, i.e., the stroller drop.  I found the 5-6 strollers around the hostess stand to be very tacky and irresponsible of the restaurant.  The hostess was not always at the front to monitor the strollers.  I've never seen a stroller drop at a restaurant before (I don't have children), so this was very strange to me. The food was tasty!  I ordered a flatbread as my second selection - My first selection was unavailable.  My husband ordered a pizza and we decided to try a mini-plate of fried mac & cheese.  We had not seen/tried fried mac & cheese before then, so we had to try it - 'Merica!.  We enjoyed ALL of our food!

Kassie C.,"Jacksonville, United States",201,101,414,3.0,30/11/2015,"I have been to California pizza several times and this particular experience took place on Veteran's Day. It was very busy but no surprise there considering it was during the middle of the day for lunch. My bf & I sat at this little table right near the well at the bar. Not the greatest spot but for not having to wait I didn't have any complaints. The service was average, but not the greatest. I waited a while just to simply ask for napkins.  As far as the food, we ordered the pepperoni pizza and it was very good but extremely greasy. I definitely  dabbed probably 50 calories of grease off with my napkin. My main reason for giving 3 stars was because of the drink I ordered. I always get the Caribbean Sunset White Sangria which is always delicious but pricey almost $9. My frustration came as I was watching the bartender make it. I understand they are obligated to fill the entire glass up with ice..no big deal..but even with the ice the drink was barely over half filled. When I  questioned the bartender about it he said they are becoming more strict on how much they fill the drink up and the measuring. If you are going to give me half a drink maybe you should consider putting it in a lot smaller glass. I had it drank in literally 3 sips. Disappointing nonetheless.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=20

Meghan H.,"Burlington, United States",166,5,8,1.0,11/11/2017,Absolutely the worst service I've ever received. I used to work at a cpk and loved it there. This particular one was absolutely atrocious. The wait for me was supposed to be 30 min. Went to the bathroom and both toilets were broken and leaking toilet water all over the place. And they were absolutely disgusting. A truck stop gas station would of been better. Stood in the lobby waiting for my name to get called. Name was never called after 30 min so I asked the manager with the attitude where I was on the list. She told me they already called my name 15 minutes ago. And if they actually had they only said it once because every other persons name they yelled multiple times. So when I told the manager that I still wanted to eat. Instead of finding the next seat for us she put me at the end of her now 2 hour long list. I have never in all my years of working in food seen such absurdity. A man in a wheelchair got pushed out of the lobby because it was too busy and he took up too much room. This place and It's manager is horrendous and I hope no veteran ever goes to this place.

I expected a lot more than what I got for the price I paid.  *Everything was super bland, I'm not much of a cook but I could've made it better at home. We got the chicken & spinach pizza which had weird grainy things on the bottom of the crust. I got the garlic cream fettuccine and I couldn't taste anything but Parmesan cheese. The pasta was pretty dry and flavorless. There was very little chicken and it too was completely bland.  *The crust of the complimentary bread was very tough and chewy.

And I only say that because I've never been a big fan of them. But I decided to give them one last try. But everyone I've eaten this with love them.

So I sided w a HALF chicken Thai salad w avocado, my fellow yelpers- a half is a full in my book. It was huge. I only was able to enjoy half. Hopefully the other half is good tomorrow.  I asked my husband how his jambalaya pasta was ""good"" lol. He's not very good at yelping.  Prices are a little steep.

I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and it was bland and not a very impressive portion given the price. Once I added enough salt to season the dish right, it tasted better and was pretty good. The noodles were cooked well but just not worth the $18 I paid after adding mushrooms.  My husbands pizza, or salad....honestly I don't know what exactly they were going for because it seemed like a dressed salad on top of a pizza crust which was just kinda confusing was okay. The salad itself was tasty but again for $15 the size wasn't impressive and I would be okay with a small size but it just wasn't amazing. Your better off going to mellow mushroom and getting an awesome pie there.  My daughters chicken breast off the kids meal was equally ""meh"".

Alex A.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, United States",8,3,2,2.0,21/4/2017,"I have lived in Jacksonville, Florida for 10 years after moving here to escape the cold winters and overcrowded streets of New York City. I have had some of the best food NYC  had to offer. Now that I have been down here for sometime now, I think it time to give restaurants a honest review, because what passed down here for food at some of the trendious restaurants will not work up north.  My overall Rating for California Pizza is two stars. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice at the time of my visit.. If that is what I was here for I would have given then three stars the overall failing marks came with dinner style & quality utensils and dishes. I order the Garlic Chicken with vegetables. I also had the frozen lemonade to drink.  My lunch date ordered the Mahi mahi Tacos with a glass of Coca-Cola​. To sum up taste of the food, the vegetables were well cooked. The major flaw was the Garlic Chicken. The Chicken was flashed frozen and then cooked. The reason why I say the is because the chicken felt like I was eating a thin layer of chicken fat with rubber underneath it. The picture of the food is very deceiving. My drink was good. My lunch date said that her food was a better looking version of food from Taco bell. So it is sad to say the California Pizza Kitchen has the look and not the taste. They need a lot of important improvements to charge the $ for their food. My total bill was $45 and I would not be eating there anytime soon.

Michael A.,"Jacksonville, United States",143,20,37,4.0,2/2/2016,"New year, new you??!!!  I enjoy this place for the two following reasons: 1) The pizza's calories are readily found on all major calorie trackers apps such as My Fitness Pal. This allows me to correctly track my macros each day.  Most pizza places do not have this options and tracking other pizza brands for calories isn't as accurate.   2) The pizza comes in a delicious single serving size. The OG Hawaiian Pizza is only a 1,200 calories compared to Little Caesars 2,500 calories for one pizza of similar size. With pizza that has this much flavor in a restaurant setting, it should be illegal!  I would recommend this place for people who are around the town center and do not want to over do it on the Carbs at ""that Italian restaurant"" there.  They have a wide arrange of food there that are not pizza as well. And, they have low/zero calorie drink options there as well.  While they are amazing, the avocado egg rolls will destroy your diet and weight loss. Avoid at all cost. Still with a single pizza as your cheat meal; you must avoid most of the appetizers at all cost!!!  The service is usually good there. The last time that I went there, I had a waitress named Michie. She was very polite and quick to help us with the menu. Overall, service there is great. It is only a few time in between shifts that things seem to not function as well. The older lady at the door who sits guest down somehow is always in the bathroom when people come in. IDK if she has a medical condition or what... but both times that I have seen her there... the same issues with customers walking in and no one being at the door was present.

It is a casual place with a cafe feel.  I am happy that I decided to try CPK for lunch instead of dinner because the restaurant seems large and fast-paced.   Service was very slow and there were menu items that were not available (ran out).  My husband's unsweet tea glass remained empty for several minutes.  We had to ask a different server to fill the glass because ours had disappeared.   Parties with strollers are asked to leave the stroller at the hostess stand, i.e., the stroller drop.  I found the 5-6 strollers around the hostess stand to be very tacky and irresponsible of the restaurant.  The hostess was not always at the front to monitor the strollers.  I've never seen a stroller drop at a restaurant before (I don't have children), so this was very strange to me. The food was tasty!  I ordered a flatbread as my second selection - My first selection was unavailable.  My husband ordered a pizza and we decided to try a mini-plate of fried mac & cheese.  We had not seen/tried fried mac & cheese before then, so we had to try it - 'Merica!.  We enjoyed ALL of our food!

He went with the California Club on thin crust.

Valerian L.,"Jacksonville, United States",3,18,15,4.0,5/12/2014,"The last time I went to CPK, I had a less-than-satisfactory experience. The food was either salty or just didn't taste like it was described as. This time, however I had an experience that signified a significant improvement at this location. Don't get me wrong, I actually loved CPK. There was this brilliant location about 15 minutes from my old home in Southern California, where you had a view that would rival those experienced by Marco Polo in Asia. The food there was certainly on par for the price bracket and it's a shame that I haven't been there in seven years. I visited CPK's Jacksonville location about four times since its opening and found it underwhelming. Obviously, since it was CALIFORNIA Pizza Kitchen, and not FLORIDA Pizza Kitchen, you would expect the highest quality establishments to be concentrated around the chain's area of origin. (This is something that most chain businesses should avoid doing yet it seems to be a recurring pattern with some.) Tonight I went to California Pizza Kitchen again, having received a call from my father who invited me to join him and my mother. He just got 100 dollars worth of gift cards for CPK and I thought that my brother, sister and I could join them.        The location itself was chosen when the Saint John's Town Centre was in no shortage of open real estate in prime locations. (CPK is located near the ever-so-popular Turtle Pond, sharing a circle with Starbucks, Teavana and Maggiano's Little Italy. It's hard to get such openings in the main area of the TC unless you're a multi-billion dollar company that can commission an entire new complex for you're store. I'm looking at you,Nordstrom.) As a result of this, CPK usually gets plenty of customers. (At least more than its neighbour: ""The Art of Shaving"" would ever get.) On an occasion, CPK can have 90+ minute waiting lists. We caught the place on a nice, quiet, meaningless Friday, which allowed us to enjoy our meal in the quiet, serene setting. We had Avacado Chicken Rolls as an appetiser. The crunchy wonton-like shell blended with the warm, flavourful filling. Which contained tomatoes, bacon and chicken. It was served with a spicy, creamy sauce and a non-spicy sauce of the same texture. For our entrée, we had three varieties of pizza: Habanero Carnitas, a soft- crusted pizza with a ""habanero element"" that wasn't actually as spicy as a real habanero pepper, but still enjoyable due to its well seasoned pork. Chipotle Chicken, a pizza with a semi-thick crust, which like the Habanero Carnitas, shares Mexican influence. The Chipotle Chicken featured tender grilled chicken, a seasoning that actually made it spicier than the Habanero Carnitas, and a Pico de Gallo topping. The pizza is served with a spicy chipotle sauce on the side that is sure to add a nice kick. Lastly we had the ""Pear+Gorgonzola"" a thin-crusted, crunchy masterpiece. The Pear+Gorgonzola, (which I will call the PG) was not only delicious due to the overall execution of the recipe, but the idea itself. CPK dared to experiment with unlikely ideas, and created one of the best slices of Pizza I have eaten. (It sits right up there some of the stuff that comes out of Libretto's, my all-time-favourite pizzeria.)    The PG is a sweet, yet slightly sour pizza, which is served as a regular pizza with Gorgonzola Cheese, which gives it the strong, Blue Cheese type flavour. The PG also includes some sliced pears, which taste like very delicious pears, and add to the sweetness of the pizza. There are some herbs and stuff, and the whole thing's served below a bed of salad with more Gorgonzola. I suppose what made the PG so spectacular is the flavour contrast, which was a risky move for CPK, yet one most rewarding. The meal overall was the highlight of my day. I think it is safe to say that California Pizza Kitchen, to me has redeemed itself. 4.8/5 stars.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40
Mandie M.,"Jacksonville, United States",483,376,925,4.0,16/11/2014,"My first taste of CPK was during a short port call in Hawaii. A friend of mine said it was a must stop for dinner, especially if we had never eaten there. It's been a long time since then, just over seven years, but CPK finally made their debut in Jacksonville a few years ago. I, typically, visit CPK on Veteran's Day. This is because of all the chain restaurants around town, I can get in and get out fairly quickly by choosing to sit at the bar rather than a table. Given that our CPK is located in the St. John's Town Center, this is quite the miracle.   Although, I haven't come to CPK and actually sat down on at a table, I know my opinion is fairly limited. It is, however, disappointment-free. I'm very happy that CPK has the option of sitting at the bar. If they didn't, they would probably turn away a ton of customers. The folks, like myself, who want to get in for a quick bite are just as important as the family of five. The other great part about the bar is being able to watch the employees construct meals and to see that huge brick oven.  I had a slight annoyance during my last visit to CPK, but it was nothing to do with the employees. I had to work on Veteran's Day and went to CPK for my lunch. The bar had a few empty seats, but not enough for this party of five (a mother and four teenage girls) that walked straight to the back. The entire group continually hovered over everyone at the bar, tried to get folks to move down from where they were seated (which wouldn't give enough seats for their whole party anyways) and were very rude. Finally, the waitress in charge of the bar area asked them to leave and profusely apologized to all of us that were sitting. She told us to take our time and eat and not let ourselves be rushed. I'm glad that the waitress had enough care to handle the situation before it got way out of hand.   As I only seem to make it over to the Town Center sparingly, and usually not to eat, I haven't tried anything else on CPK's menu other than pizza. Of the pizzas that I have had, I haven't been disappointed. The ingredients harken back to my time in Sicily and the crust is perfectly cooked. Given my New England roots, I have been spoiled by great Italian food, especially pizza, all my life. CPK is right up there with some of the best from back home for me. I see a few fellow Yelpers drawing a comparison between CPK and Mellow Mushroom. I don't feel that the comparison is fair. The styles of each chain are very different. For myself, I can tell the difference between a pizza from CPK and a pizza from Mellow and I like both. Each style of pizza has its own unique qualities.  I do need to actually go and enjoy a sit down meal. Now that I have my new job just a few minutes up the road on Beach Blvd, I'm sure that I can conquer that task in the near future.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40

But,3 star because, one of the reasons I go to CPK every week is for their food which includes the warm bread they serve with olive oil (yummm) And when I went to this place, I was really hungry as we were driving from MD to FL and tired from the shopping I couldn't resist doing in the mall this place is in. So, naturally I wanted to pounce on the bread before I got my food and they literally brought 3 pieces of bread for a table of 3 people !!!! Yes,I have a problem with that :/ This never happens in our local CPK. Give out some more bread,dammit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40

We started with the white bean guacamole. It was different & refreshing and got our taste buds prepared for what was to come. My husband ordered a sandwich while I stuck to the must-have pizza.

Naomi B.,"Orange Park, United States",857,115,534,4.0,9/6/2013,"Yes, I know it's a chain, but it's one of the very FEW chains that I've fancied since back in the day. Andddd the busiest CPK location in the US? Yup...Hawaii (there's only 1 CPK). I was surprised our server (Jordan) this evening knew that. However, truth be told, I actually like the St. Johns Town Center location much better as far as size (larger) and atmosphere (fresh and fancy). We arrived later in the evening for dinner (around 7 p.m.), and though the place was hoppin', we were seated well within 5 minutes. I love the ""chill mode"" vibe here. Lights were dimmed, staff was polite and welcoming, swanky ultra modern decor that was easy on the eyes...all made for a very delightful visit. Food: I ordered a starter of mediterranean focaccia bread off their ""small plates"" menu to share with mom and family friend. The bread had cheese and herbs baked in, and was very delish when dipped in the olive oil and parmesan. Soon after, my all-time fave, the White Pizza (mozzarrela, ricotta, parmesan, pecorino romano,sauteed spinach, and roasted garlic) was set before me. I love, love, LOVE this pizza. Cheesy crusty goodness, and the touch of garlic fuses everything together. Never a disappointment.  Mom went with the California Veggie Pizza (baby broccoli, eggplant, corn, red onions, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella, and tomato sauce), and requested a whole wheat crust. She said it was very flavorful, but she had hoped that there would be more of an abundance of veggies on her pizza, that they were pretty scattered. Family friend...based on a recommendation from our server...had the mac n cheese. I had a couple bites and thought it was very good and not artificial-tasting. She liked it as well, but wanted a deeper and more prominent cheese flavor.  Service: Spot on from the get-go, thank you, Jordan. Great, positive demeanor, and knowledgeable of menu items and ingredients. Drinks never went empty, and food was fresh and delicious.

I did call their guest services number and my information and received a call from a female employee who did not identify herself. Her response was uncaring and arrogant and stated we replaced your pizza. My point is that they should have apologized to keep me as a customer. Even when I called their corporate office their regional gave me lipservice after explaining the situation. I stated all I wanted was and apology and it would be a nice token to give something to win back my business after the biggest faux pas in the food business. I am a graduate from the Art Institute in Culinary Management  to be a chef.   Wish you guys would learn that its cheaper to keep a regular customer then gain a new one..  I""m also a MBA student so I'm not talking out the side of my neck.

Anne-Marie B.,"Houston, United States",171,234,121,2.0,15/7/2012,"I would like to preface this review by acknowledging that this was the first time I'd visited this location. I am open to trying it again, as I realize there is at least one crap server at every restaurant...my server was exceptionally incompetent at CPK. I tend to surround myself with a pretty attractive group of ladies. Never did I imagine that this would be to my detriment. On this visit, there were 4 of us dining. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was our server's first serving job, and he must have been new. If you don't know how to manage a lunch rush, the least you can do is acknowledge your inability to do your job. That way, at least your table knows you know the exist. Apparently this guy had a soft spot in his heart for Italians (much to my dismay, as one of the women dining with us was full-blooded Sicilian). Once he finally showed up to the table, he went out of his way to accommodate ONE person at the table...the saucy Italian. Great. All I wanted was a water. Just a water. Is it too much to ask to refill my water, along with the Italian's, when they're both empty? We're in FLORIDA in the middle of SUMMER. This is not a tall request.  We sat for an excessively long time after being greeted, so when he was walking by, I politely asked if we could place our order and he scoffed and explained to me that he had several tables and he was working as fast as he could. Sorry bro, doesn't work for me. I've been in your shoes an I know how this is supposed to go. Considering he'd visited all his other tables around us TWICE already, I wasn't sympathetic, and decided it was our turn.  Bad move. He literally ignored my drink for the entire meal. The Italian (and no one else) was accommodated prior to her even requesting things. The best part was, after chewing on ice to make the point that I was clearly being neglected, he turned to the saucy Italian and asked her if she'd like a water to go.  I honestly couldn't tell you what I ordered, how it tasted, what the restaurant even looked like. All I saw was red.  As I said before, I will give this place another chance if the opportunity ever presents itself, but rest assured my first order of business will be to point the server out to the hostess that will NOT be taking care of me.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=60

Chang's.   Negatives?  1: The wait time was long, but that's to be expected at any new restaurant in the Town Center.  2: There were, like, 5 managers hovering around nervously and getting in the waiters' way.  All 5 asked how how our meals were which was pleasant the first time, humorous the next two times, and freaking annoying the remaining times. 3: The shrimp scampi pizza was no longer on the menu.  But, the pear gorgonzola pizza was back on, so I considered that to be an even trade.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=80

Despite the restaurants name, this place does not offer nearly as fantastic a pizza as, say, Mellow Mushroom.

Wish I could give zero stars for failed customer service. I will try to email corporate on this one.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=80
Claire D.,"Jacksonville, United States",1,4,,5.0,1/12/2012,"We stopped in at California Pizza Kitchen in the St. Johns Town Center prompted by a flyer from the University of North Florida's Relay for Life organization. The flyer indicated that on Nov. 28th, 20% of our bill went to the American Cancer Society's UNF Relay for Life fundraising effort. We had not dined in this California Pizza Kitchen before but had enjoyed two previous visits to the location in Waterford Lakes (Orlando), FL. We were not disappointed! Our server, Dean, was courteous, prompt, and anticipated our every request. This fella was a top-notch server. We ordered the Crispy Mac n' Cheese for an appetizer, which was delicious and the perfect size (four small samples for $3.75). Another in the party enjoyed the Dakota pea soup, which smelled heavenly. Two shared a Sicilian pizza which was loaded with Italian meats, and quite ample for $14. I enjoyed the Chicken Milanese for $15.50. It was three boneless chicken breasts dipped in panko bread crumbs and lightly fried, then topped with arugula and a tomato/olive oil concoction which was light and tasty. The cranberry cooler ($2.50) was a nice change from the usual drink of sweet tea (and included free refills), and hubs enjoyed a cappuccino ($4.25) after the meal. Since it was a fundraiser, we splurged on two scrumptious desserts to share. First was a warm butter cake ($6.25) that was out of this world delicious; the second was a chocolate souffle with Haagen Dazs ice cream -- yum, yum, yum (@ $7.75). We dined about 7 p.m. and expected a wait, but were seated immediately. There are many wonderful eatiers in the St. Johns Town Center, many are more pricey, but don't miss California Pizza Kitchen. We applaud their spirit of community service as well as their delicious entrees and professional service. Thanks for a great evening!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=80
