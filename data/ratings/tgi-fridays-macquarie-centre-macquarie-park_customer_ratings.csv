15,Tim D.,"Halifax, Canada",74,516,123.0,2.0,2014-04-09,"I should have known better. If TGI Friday's is a pretty inoffensive and average restaurant back in its native USA, how was it ever going to be good here? Answer: it wasn't. The menu has a broad range of food. If you're a native North American looking for comfort food you could easily be duped into thinking this was the way to get your fix. Don't bother, it will not be as good. I had a club sandwich here that was quite disappointing: processed turkey slices, a slice of processed cheese, insufficient mayo, and just not very tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
23,Jane D.,"Sydney, Australia",0,5,,3.0,2014-06-22,"Been here twice.  Service is about. 6 out of ten. Both times I have gone I have pre booked, and still have had to wait to be seated. Upon looking around there are always many tables waiting to be cleared. The entire staff team needs an all round kick up the back side, they just aren't efficient. They seem to sit behind their name.  Food:  I find the menu quite confusing. It's  complex, things are over described so you aren't really sure what you are getting. You get lost in all their adjectives!  Don't recommend the burgers, simple boring bread, just piled together, chips on the side. I do recommend the potato twisters, think Thins chips, but hot, and with sour cream and cheese, and spices. Omg I could eat those forever.  The fajita tower ( build your own) was very boring. Just a few wraps, some sloppy capsicum and sliced up chicken, then grated cheese and lettuce, you've got to put it all together which seems fun, but tasted like some crap I would cook up at home. Chocolate thick shakes, best thick shake I have ever had! Love it to bits.  Overall- it's the service and management that let this place down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park?start=20,,,,,
12,Peter A.,"Sydney, Australia",73,118,149.0,2.0,2015-01-31,"I don't know whether this place deserves two stars or three stars because overallit was pretty decent I guess. I went with a bunch of friends on a Monday night so it was very quiet, and it is the first time that I have been to TGI Friday.  I looked at the menu before I got there and was very excited with the amount of greasy American-style food there was. After ordering the Texas burger I was salivating at the idea of onion rings on my burger, When it came out it was surprisingly small and pretty tasteless. We also ordered nachos to share, which again was tasteless and very boring to look at. I got the impression that the people working there really did not want to be there especially the lady serving us, she was very pleasant but you could just see that she was over being there.after a few awkward jokes she just hung around in the shadows and it was difficult to get service after we ordered. The Desserts looked great if you want an instant heart attack or diabetes, and if I'm going to get desert I would be a much happier going to Max Brenner right next door. Overall very plain.. I most probably would not go back and would not recommend it to friends, the whole experience from the food to the people to the restaurant all seems so fake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
4,Peter T.,"Sydney, Australia",14,210,332.0,3.0,2015-02-12,"We went with our daughter and her husband who is a fan of TGI Friday from his visits in the USA. We ordered to share appetizers of chicken wings and potato skins they were all quite tasty. Then i decided to share with my wife the chicken, rib & prawn meat platter as we each didn't want a large meal. The meal was a bit boring as the vegetables were very hard and undercooked. The staff were quite attentive, but they must hate the customer birthday celebration ritual as amount 6 staff have to visit the table of the lucky birthday person and clap & clap for ever whilst I think signing. I suppose it's good but if you didn't know it was going to happen it could be embarrassing. Overall the restaurant is a very American experience not sure if that's good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
22,Jessica J.,"Sydney, Australia",32,127,240.0,3.0,2015-04-24,"Been here twice now, I love American which is why I return to TGIs not many other places do it. This time around I was a little disappointed, the buffalo wings were over cooked, the potato skins were a little dry and lacked in cheese & bacon. I also have an issue with paying for ranch sauce when I've asked it as a substitute for sour cream! The burger pretty bland also, overall not the best experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park?start=20,,,,,
19,Mirzia B.,"Sydney, Australia",70,65,166.0,3.0,2015-05-03,"I never got the chance to eat at TGI Fridays when I was in the states so  thought I'd give it a go and it was just as i had expected, there was a great atmosphere in the restaurant as it was packed with people all watching a boxing match on the tv screens,  the service was fast but the food was a little slow to come out, but that was expected as it was a busy day. We ordered the mac n cheese bites, calamari and chicken fajita nachos for entree and a classic club sandwich and a bacon cheese burger, it was all nice but nothing to jump up and down about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
14,Melissa T.,"Sydney, Australia",120,32,83.0,2.0,2015-07-05,"Wait to get seated they tell you go to the bar, they have some serious lack of customer service next to none waiters to be seen, orders being incorrect or old menu still online & food being served cold.. is very disappointing.

20,Mark S.,"Sydney, Australia",12,104,144.0,2.0,2015-07-21,"It's a hard one to score as I like the food, the place & the whole Americaness feel to the place but they're missing the real stand out of when you eat out in the States which is the almost over the top level of service.  The staff here often feel like they're hiding from you rather than the somewhat in your face enthusiasm of the tip driven American way. The food orders do come out fast but it's hard to get the staff's attention to order food or drinks in the first place or when you're after another round.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park?start=20,,,,,
21,Daniel C.,"Northmead, Australia",15,20,26.0,1.0,2015-07-30,"Extremely disappointed. TGIF draw customers in by misleading them. Food is a lot smaller than what is shown in their marketing. When I received my meal I felt robbed, for the same amount of money that I spent on the TGIF burger (that Canadian burger), I could get 2 KFC meals (zinger stacker) which would be 4 times as much food. Service was slow, and staff were stupid (because they were surprised why I was not satisfied, and could not understand why either... I mean c'mon you've gotta at least acknowledge that this place is a rip off). I don't know why I went. Last time I went 3 years ago in Melbourne I sworn I'd never go back, this time its clear that they never changed. I hope this place shuts down real soon. The business before them was so much better. TGIF, I hate you... go back to America",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park?start=20,,,,,
18,Elyse Jay Z.,"Sydney, Australia",18,3,,2.0,2015-08-13,"The vibe of the place is cool and the staff were friendly but that's where the good points end. The wait to be seated was longer than advised. While we waited we saw multiple tables left empty and dirty, with one taking our whole seated time to be cleaned and reset. My husband and I both ordered (expensive) burgers and they were a disappointment.  Overall I wouldn't go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
10,Lisa S.,"Lexington, KY",9,119,95.0,1.0,2015-10-18,"This location at the Macquarie Centre has to be the worst TGIF's I have ever had food at/from.  Our first experience ( attempted experience) we walked into there on a 90 degree day and they had no air conditioning! Why would they even be open? It was so bloody hot in there it didn't matter that they had a full bar!  So obviously we left.   A day later we were in need of food, so we actually called in the order and my husband ran over and picked up the take away.  We ordered chicken wings and potatoes skins.  How is it possible to wreck two of the easiest appetizers to make on any menu anywhere!!??  Well all I can say is blech, ew, ish! The potatoes skins were pathetic and seemed like they dumped them out of a box of frozen food.  And the wings were sloppy and very very tiny.   Terrible. Do not go here.  I wouldn't feed this to a starving dog.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
17,Nikki R.,"Front Royal, VA",100,1,5.0,5.0,2015-11-21,"Stopped by on my way out of the DC Meteo area to take my kids horse back riding. I've been to ""Fridays"" before, but this one is exceptional!  The door was opened for us by a hostess and they have updated menus (not the food but the actual menu... like pretty to look at and substantial to feel) and new kids cups....  As minute as it might be it all led up to Justine. She greeted us with a smile, was knowledgeable about the drink specials (lol) and drew with my kids!..... the rest is history.  Being in the customer service industry myself, i know all too well that critisism comes easier than praise. Across the seas there are hundreds of families mourning loss but today I choose to be thankfull.  This is my first yelp and I decided to make it thankful for what there is and give thanks! THANK YOU JUSTINE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
3,Ed H.,"Sydney, Australia",13,128,549.0,5.0,2015-12-13,"My partner and I never got to eat at a TGI Fridays while in the U.S. but thought we'd give it a try on home soil. We had a tiny wait while they cleared a table for us upstairs, so we chilled at the bar with a couple of menus and was welcomed by the nicest/coolest bartender I'd ever met. Before long we were shown to our table. Our waiter was the nicest fellow, who even squatted down to our level to talk to us - not sure if that broke some secret waiter/client edict or not but I thought it was a very respectful gesture.  No starters or entrees as we assumed the meals would be big and we were right. He chose straight from the burger section. My partner went with a regular (1 patte) Ultimate Jack Daniels burger and I got a Texas burger. The Ultimate JD REGULAR doesn't come with the fried onion rings so my gf also got a side of onion rings to add on herself. For drinks she got an Ultimate Blue Lemonade cocktail which was about the same size as her face. I got a Coke and discovered they gave free refills, something I really missed about America.  The burgers where just breathtakingly good. The balance of great solid flavours just made life worth living. The sauces were delicious, especially the JD sauce which has just the right kick to it. The meat was cooked just perfectly, and the chips... My gosh those chips! Crunchy golden jackets covering hot fluffy potato seasoned with just the right amount of salt. It was such a filling meal. When paying the cheque we were asked if we wanted to leave a tip, and in my opinion quality service deserves to be rewarded. I don't know about Australia but in the U.S. I learnt that it's 10% on top of your overall bill if the service was okay, 15% if it was good and 20% for outstanding. However don't overlook that minimum wage in the States is far far lower then ours and their service staff can only survive due to the tips. The booths had a cozy feeling to them, the atmosphere was pleasant, and the lighting levels were just right for us. God Bless America.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
9,Ruby Y.,"Sydney, Australia",69,191,278.0,1.0,2016-03-07,"I don't know why I keep coming here expecting a different result. The wait for our food always takes a lifetime. Waiting 20 minutes for some stupid glasses of water and close to an hour for some entrees. When the food finally arrives they are missing two of our entree dishes. We wait another half hour for them...they finally arrive after badgering the waitstaff three times about them with the mains. So, it seems those last two entrees had been sitting on the bench waiting to be collected for the half hour because the chips were soggy and soaked through with sauce.  OMG it's just all so bad, I can't even think straight typing this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
11,Katherine S.,"Artarmon, Australia",5,24,22.0,3.0,2016-04-24,"Food is average and overpriced. Service is alright, but maybe not for everyone as they like to joke around with customers. We went on a Saturday night as a large group. Noticed there was variation in how burgers were cooked for the same order, with one person having their burger served dry and overcooked. I ordered the buffalo chicken tacos for $22. It included two tacos and a side of crispy seasoned fries. The buffalo chicken was very spicy and it would've been nice if it was served with some kind of creamy sauce to offset it. The fries were soggy which is disappointed for something specifically described as ""crispy"", and they seemed a touch undercooked. Very average food.  The best part of my meal was the drink. I ordered a smoothie - Gold Medallist. It was exactly as described and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
1,Lance A.,"Sydney, Australia",30,144,188.0,4.0,2016-05-09,"There was something that reeled me in to TGIF's Mac Centre. A familiar name perhaps? The prospect of a good meal? Booze?!  Well fellow Yelpers, whatever it was; I'm not sorry I walked in.  I was greeted very promptly by a very cheeky waitress, who was all smiles and very relaxed. I asked for a seat at the bar [where they serve their full menu], my drink order was taken, and so began the experience.  The décor smacked very much of a modern American Diner, with a very tiny hint of Pub thrown in (dunno where that came from but it was there!).  Steak is an absolute must here. Ditch the entrées/starters and head straight to the grill page... Being trepidatious and wary of your menu that could be falling apart in your very hands at any moment.  Only 10 minutes and 1 scotch later, my meal arrived (so did my second scotch, but that's our secret). Scotch fillet (medium-well), cheddar mash (watch out for the tons of pepper they thrown into this), and a side or veggies with parsley butter. Each bite as amazing as the last.  $54 was the grand total - $34 for the steak and mash, $4 for the veggies, $8 per scotch.  If my meal didn't sit on the pass for 5 minutes it may have been hotter, hence the 4/5 rating.  I'll be going back some day, and so should you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
2,Steve H.,"Sydney, Australia",14,31,64.0,1.0,2016-06-18,"Went there last night on account of their 20th birthday promo. Service was pleasant, everything else would aggravate most. Soggy, oil-drenched chips and onion rings that had to be sent back to the kitchen, ribs that were completely unseasoned and cooked so far ahead in time before being reheated that it was dry (and yet still cost $50), a coleslaw ""side"" that came in a thimble for sauce my fork couldn't actually fit into, baffling ""nachos"" that consisted of all but four pieces on a pretentious rectangular plate, with materials costing no more than $1, being sold for $11 (what do they do with the other non-perfectly shaped pieces?) and a random plate of packet-chips-on-a-plate with ranch sauce for more than $10. A couple sitting behind us took a few bites of their disgusting food, got the bill and left, presumably to have dinner. Have been to TGI's in three countries and have found ours to have by far, the worst food, but (not surprisingly) the best service. Why go to this place when hurricanes, or even outback, is significantly better for the same price?  TGI didn't pay full price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
13,Christine C.,"Sydney, Australia",35,56,44.0,4.0,2016-06-20,"This is your classic American restaurant in Australia - not really much different from any other restaurant, but fill it with ""American"" decor and seating and add plenty of greasy burgers and stamp it with the big US of A hahaha. Having said that, I do like this place, I really do. Especially their burgers. It might be blasphemous to say (please don't kick me out of the Fatties Burger Appreciation Society!), but the burger I ate from here is a solid 4/5 (Bar Luca and BBJ being the 5/5s of course).

16,Michael C.,"Sydney, Australia",3,43,21.0,1.0,2016-07-14,"Decided to eat at tgif on a Thursday night before a 9:15 movie. All seemed good, was shown to a table up stairs at a window. Pretty tempting drinks menu and thankfully a gf marked menu for my wife...  Drinks were slow to come and ran out of one and had to order something else (not sure if they ran out of the Hendricks gun or mixer) and when arrived was underwhelming.  I ordered the Jack Daniels burger and wife ordered the short rib (gluten free as marked in menu). Waitress came out to say there were nuts in marinade so rib will not be gf. I explained nuts are not gluten so it's fine.  Took a while and when food arrived looked good. Started tucking in and my burger was great! Sauce was delicious as stated! Partner started her meal, put the chips onto her plate (out of those silly baskets) and the waitress came over and said the chips were coated in wheat flour and therefore contains gluten. WTF why would you serve gluten chips with a gluten free meal (as marked on menu) and now the whole meal was contaminated.  With 20 minutes left could only opt for a tuna salad (again underwhelming).  My meal was good, although I felt a bit guilty eating my fully loaded burger while she had s couple of bites of a poor salad.  Anyway $75 later we are off to a movie via woollies to buy something my wife can eat in the cinema.  I expect TGIF would be good for beers and burgers but not if you want anything better. Might go back with mates but not with wife or coeliacs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-macquarie-centre-macquarie-park,,,,,
7,Kyle B.,"Sydney, Australia",0,3,1.0,1.0,2016-07-16,"Came here at 7:30 on a Friday. Door woman gave us a buzzer and said 20 minute wait.  60 mins later we were just about to order Japanese from somewhere else when the buzzer went off.  Seated. Waited 10 mins for a waitress to finally walk past and ignore us. Had to wave her down to order.  Got the $45 ribeye and the Cajun chicken pasta.  Food took 30 mins to arrive. Steak was well done (asked for medium rare). Sent it back. Lots of apologies.  Pasta was ok, chicken was a bit dry and the portion fairly small.  New steak arrived ten minutes later. Still over cooked but closer to medium/medium-well. It was ok. For $45? Definitely over priced.  Service slow. Long waits. Bad-average food and a hefty bill at the end. Arrived at 7:30.

8,Kate P.,"Sydney, Australia",25,43,62.0,1.0,2017-01-17,"Well.... firstly I had booked a table as a surprise birthday dinner. Some of the party arrived before me and had asked that we not say that I was arriving with the birthday girl... so he makes a big deal about what amount of people and if I had books it etc.  We got to our table and had to stop someone to order our drinks (at this stage it wasn't even busy).  The drinks came except the water (one of the party had ordered water) so we had to stop him again to ask for the water.  Two of our party ordered a range of starters to share & two of those came with everyone but one of our meals. The waiter came over & said her meal would be another 7 minutes.  Then after about 10 minutes he came and said it will be another 7 minutes. The people who had the starters got their remainders at this stage.  We then had a manager come and say the meal would be another 10 minutes! I mean really!!! She finally got her meal, a burger, and by then we had all finished our meals. He said 'sorry about the delay it got really busy'. They decided to bring out a free strawberry smoothie, like anyone wanted it. He then cleaned up the table of drinks and took away the birthday girls drinks even though she wasn't finished.  We had the manager come by and told her about it so she said she would bring another drink. It took about 15 minutes and it then took for us to stop the waiter for the hill, at least 30 minutes later.
