13,Jim H.,"Baltimore, MD",9,144,1.0,2.0,2012-02-21,"If your food of choice involves chicken, this place is for you, because 90% of the dishes here are chicken-based.  After all ""chicken is so versatile"".  I'm no huge fan of chicken, with all its dirty warehouse processing and their poor living conditions...but all PETA aside, this place is overrated.   I decided on nachos and was ready to order when the waitress came.  She asked me if I wanted the ""9 or the 12"".  So I just had to ask ""The nine or the twelve what? I want nachos!"" So she explained to me that the nachos there were counted out and each chip had toppings on it.  So I just had to mess with her.  I told her I wanted the 13. Stupid me, I didn't realize our country had such a corn chip shortage (smack HEAD!)....Well I certainly wanted to do my part to chip in (pun intended); wouldn't want the less fortunate not to have their chip rations for the week. Imagine the chaos of a chip rebellion in this country--poor, ragged indigent people with salsa jars in their hands with nothing to dip in it.  The horror!  Deciding that was too much stupidity for me, I changed my order. I got a cheeseburger. Not sure what it was called-something to do with an avocado, b'cus there was a slice of avocado on it-duh! Not bad, but nothing great for the price.   Also a pet peeve of mine is when restaurants pre-salt their fries.  WTF is with that?  Can't they trust me to season my own damn fries? My girlfriend had the chili and was repulsed.  I tasted it and it and found that it to be a thin gruel seasoned with chili.  You'd think a place called Chili's could do a decent chili!  The feck?!  Garbage!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=20,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002

45,Jackie K.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,1,,1.0,2013-01-25,"I'm sitting here right now watching my friends eat lunch... Why am I not eating you ask?  Because I am deathly allergic to onions and our lovely waitress could not be bothered to check and find out something I could eat. She checked on the one thing I asked about and then said ""sorry a lot of our stuff has onion in it.""  Really?  No, really?  In front of her I closed my menu and told my friends to order saying I just won't eat, if they have nothing I can eat..  She didn't even attempt to ask a manager or chef to find me something.  She didn't even suggest I order dessert.  It is absolutely not okay to let your customer sit here and watch others eat, Ms. Christina.  I will never come here again after this experience.  After being made to feel like it's ok for me to just not eat rather than her taking the time to ask anyone else what is onion free, I'll take my business elsewhere where they do care and I hope you do too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
47,S F.,"Perry Hall, MD",27,26,2.0,1.0,2013-03-02,Have visited several times before with mixed results. Took my grand daughter out for a girl's night. We were there early  on a Saturday about 4.  Waitresses were nice  and attentive until we got our food. Food was good but nothing spectaculsr.  When the food arrived I indicated I needed a refill of iced tea. We finished our meals and still no refill. We looked over the desserts and decided on one. Grand daughter and I waited another 10 minutes watching our waitresses go bye without a nod to us. After we started putting our coats one of the waitresses asked if we wanted dessert. Told her we did 10 minutes ago and I wanted a drink over 20 minutes ago but we don't want anything but the check now. She prompted brought it. As we walked out the hostess asked us to wait as the manager wanted to give us a gift certificate. I declined as I will never go back.  I am a local resident and will take my money elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
44,Nancy M.,"Bel Air, MD",9,59,16.0,1.0,2013-05-15,"I eat at Chili's when I am jonesing for Steak Fajitas.  We usually eat in the bar area, and except for a miss here and there, it usually lives up to my expectations.   One lunchtime nearly 6 months ago, I ate here with friends.  We had the 2 server tag-team thing.  Neither of them could be bothered with us (3 at our table on a tight lunch schedule).  We did order, but the food was very long in coming out.  We finally asked the manager and it was brought by her.  Never really saw our team, until of course the bill was presented with a smile and a ""hope you enjoyed everything.""  Unfortunately for her that day, one member of our party was not having it and insisted on the manager coupons. 1 star for lack of service. Another time, several months ago, I took my daughter and her boyfriend here for dinner and their steaks (ordered mid-rare) came out after a long wait very well-done.  They got sent back and after another very long wait (during which time the others in the party completed our meal) their steaks arrived.  The server blamed the kitchen saying yes, she did put it in mid-rare.  The manager came out and said, we are very sorry about that.  And that was it.  A 2 to 3 star experience due to service. Now we got on a streak and several months go by where everything is hot and yummy.....mmmm..... As with all streaks, this one had to be broken.  As we were sitting in the bar, I ordered a cordial afer dinner drink straight up (neat, though I said, and it was verified, straight up, no ice).  It was brought with ice.  And sent back since I did not want this beverage cold.  We watched and it sat on the bar counter for a few minutes, the bar tender poured off the cordial into another glass and gave it back to me.  Now it was cold and watered down.  I watch enough Restaurant Stakeouts and Mystery Diners and anything Gordan Ramsey to know that this is a no-no...  it was 4 stars up to that point, but took a nose dive to 2.... Now we come to today.  I didn't bring my lunch to work and pretty much didn't really want fast food.  Ahhh....let's give Chili's To Go a try.  I order the Chicken Fajitas Combo.   I picked it up in the bar of the restaurant and took it back to work.  (I work like a few minutes away).  I forgot to mention I got a side of onion strings, and who can resist partaking on the drive back.  They were stone cold as soon as I got them.  Still tasty, because after all, they are deep fried onions.  But cold...not warm or tepid.  Cold.  I opened up the Fajitas. Every thing was cold except for the flour tortillas, which were pretty hot.  3 of the pieces of chicken were raw in the very middle (see above love of all things Gorden Ramsy and I could hear him disgusted in my head) and the onions and peppers were not ""fajitacized.""  It was so sad.  I made up a fajita with the safe chicken and veg and stuff.  By this time the tortillas were solidifying (spare me the use of micro-waves in restaurants!).  Frankly, it was just...ICK.   Half star (I was going to type 1/2 but was afraid it might be equated to 1-2 stars) for food and I hope I don't get sick, but my office is very close to the ladies' room so I should be good... I just think my relationship with Chili's is at it's end.  So sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

It was the second time I'd been there since our offices moved up Cockeysville way, and I typically opt for a local place for a better lunch, or the local Subway for a more pedestrian lunch. The first visit doesn't even stick out in my mind, and I presume the food didn't impress me enough that I chose to make the time and effort to post a review (I'll often give a place a second chance, which is why I don't have all that many one and two star reviews). This time around the food took a long time to arrive, and one of our party was given the wrong beverage. And my fajitas were so very, very disappointing. Don't know what Chili's has done as far as recipe changes, but the new fajitas - and mine were overcooked - tasted very heavily of black pepper. YUCK!

When we sat down, we were given out menus and not even a minute later, our server came out and asked us if we were ready to order.

Even could leave a tip and use a coupon with the computer service.

Placed our order from the Two-for-Twenty menu; seems like a good value.  Onion ring appetizer was excellent.  My wife got the bacon cheeseburger - really good - and french fries - blah. I got the half rack of ribs with a side of their NEW skillet smoked potato wedges. First the potatoes; unpleasant smoky taste accompanied by a white dipping sauce that tasted like lemon yogurt.  Does anyone really like this combination?  The ribs; most other rib joints would consider this a child's portion.  Six ribs that probably contained no more than two ounces of meat in total.  Tasted okay, but not what could be considered a dinner portion.  Very disappointing visit.  Only the comp drinks, cheeseburger and onion rings elevated this from a one star to two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

C.,"Orlando, FL",136,1164,8699.0,3.0,2016-07-29,"(7/29/2016)  UPDATE.  They've tried to update the menu with more fresh options even wheatberries and quinoa, and that restaurant gold, avocados.  People will pay more for anything with avocado or ""fresh"" guacamole (us included).  It was probably too optimistic to expect really fresh guacamole from a Chili's.  The molcajete came to the table with the already mashed avocado in it, all the server did was mix-in some diced red onion, pickled jalapeno, and diced tomato, left us with 1 lime wedge.  Likely these were frozen avocado halves or pulp that they thawed in the microwave.  Yeah, I saw that life hack on the interwebs, too, ""How to instantly ripen an avocado in the microwave.""  It didn't work when I did it either.  That's what this guacamole tasted like with the dry texture, too.  The  2 for $20 still the best deal. Had the Honey Chipotle BBQ on both the Half Rack (fall off the bone) and Chicken Crispers (flaky crispy), both decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
23,Cynthia F.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",127,194,483.0,4.0,2016-10-03,"Ok, so I came to Chili's last night and ordered a steak. I don't really have super high standards for chain restaurant steaks but this steak was perfect! I was very pleasantly surprised. I got the 10oz medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and so tender, not chewy at all. The skillet mashed potatoes were also very good! I will say that service was very slow during my visit last night, that was the only disappointing part. My absolute FAVORITE type of dessert is a warm, gooey cake, cookie, or brownie with ice cream on top. Chili's has so many desserts right up my alley with their molten cakes and skillet cookie-- yum!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

25,Shanay B.,"Owings Mills, MD",97,148,25.0,4.0,2017-01-08,After dining at the Chilis in White Marsh about a month ago I honestly did not want to return.  I spoke to my amazing parents about the restaurant they mentioned going to the Timonium location where we did enjoy our time.  I had the 3 for 10.00 special and my parents had create your own fajitas.  The only problem we encountered which was small was the waitress gave me salad instead of chips and salsa. Our original waitress corrected the minor problem.  Refills and good conversation were flowing that evening.  Ill be back to this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
26,Molly B.,"Baltimore, MD",15,48,47.0,2.0,2017-03-24,"Visited this location three times. I didn't want to write a review until I gave it a fair shot.  This location is somewhat obscured. It's right off of i83, but not on the main road (York Rd).  It's a stand alone Restauarant next to a hotel.  The area is somewhat industrial. There are a lot of trucks, the light rail, etc.  Ordering to-go was easy and simple. Is your best option, but, check your order before you leave.  I visited one evening, around 9 pm, where we were promptly ignored for almost 20 mins. It wasn't crowded, but this location rarely is crowded, because it's location is somewhat in the cut. After alerting the management we left.  Decided come back another time, I know I am a glutton for punishment, but I'm a points member & love the chips with salsa.  On my last occasion, we came earlier in the day during lunch. It still wasn't a typical crowd, like I am used to seeing at a Chilis. The staff were attentive. However, there were FLIES everywhere. in between the booths, around our food, on some of the other tables. NOPE NOPE NOPE.  Will not visit this location ever again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
31,Jesse B.,"Pikesville, MD",0,2,,1.0,2017-05-06,This was the worst experience of my life. The manager was extremely rude and threatened to spit in my food!!!! I will never go to another Chilis in my life. I do not know her name but she accused me of stealing a bowl and gave me a nasty attitude. The manager also threw in some racist remarks! By the way the steaks there are extremely dry! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
21,Yvone R.,"Ravenna, OH",182,496,202.0,5.0,2017-05-25,"I was staying at the Holiday Inn that is connected to this Chili's, so I was able to frequent this establishment often.  Every time I arrived, I was always promptly greeted and seated.  Everyone was always so friendly and helpful.  I got to try a lot of great tasting food that always came out hot or cold, depending on the dish, and the drinks were plentiful.  I never had to ask for refills.  The place as a whole is clean and neat.  Bathrooms don't smell nor were they messy.  Yes, I'd come back!  I loved the Buffalo Cauliflower and watermelon margaritas the best!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
20,Helen H.,"San Jose, CA",10,232,194.0,3.0,2017-08-01,"This is a convenient restaurant connected to a hotel. The food is okay. There is a decent amount of options available, from burgers to ribs. The chicken and prime rib enchiladas came with a good amount of meat and was filling. The sour cream, salsa, pick de gallo, lime, cheese, and guacamole have some life to the meal. The buffalo wings were pretty crispy and tasted pretty good. The celery that came with it looked kind of old. The shrimp tacos were not too good and were kind of plain. The mango chicken plate was okay. The chicken was soft and the mangos gave it a nice tropical punch. The salad is overly drenched in dressing and was not fresh.  Customer service really depends on who the waiter is. I find that the male waiters were much better to deal with. I was ignored by the hostess when she accommodated a pair of men that arrived after me. Ordering to go at the bar area during lunch was the worse experience ever. I ended up being ignored by the waitress for over 10 minutes even though she passed by me at least five times. I ended ordering over the phone while sitting in the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-timonium,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
