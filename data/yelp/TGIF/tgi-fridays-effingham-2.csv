M Q.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,39,12,5.0,11/9/2017,"Thank you Jess, Amber and Charlie were just what we needed after too much time on the highway from Chicago! Thanks girls for good conversation and a fun atmosphere to unwind and relax!  We had the Jack Sliders and Long Islands.  The sliders were really good, generous portion for an appetizer actually.  We requested some sauce on the aide and all came out as ordered.  Jess was training and did a great job taking pur order as well as answering the phone and taking their order, giving them directions to the restaurant and jumping right back into the bar and taking care of a full bar.  There was a steady stream of people in and out and the girls did a great job chatting up the guests with local knowledge and funny stories.  Thanks again for a very good experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Scott L.,"Conroe, TX",130,497,1388,2.0,2/7/2017,"When you arrive at a sports bar 10 minutes before the kick off of Super Bowl LI, and find a spot at the bar in front of the TV, are you lucky? I thought so. Service was cordial and orders for awful gunky french onion soup and horrid bacon wrapped jalapeños arrived promptly. The server advised enjoying them because ""they"" are removing them from the menu. Good idea. Also had a Caesar salad and questionable garlic wings with fried green beans.  I use ""questionable"" because I'm not positive which dish was responsible for the intestinal distress that ensued.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Lyle S.,"Zachary, LA",82,73,123,3.0,8/9/2017,Standard Americana. Good service. Drinks were a bit weak. Service was friendly and efficient. It was a good place for our loud group to open up and have a good time. I wasn't very hungry so I just had a quesadilla. Cheese was cheap but it was a TGIF after all. Dont really have any real complaints. We had a good time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Michael P.,"Golden, CO",14,113,4,1.0,2/12/2017,"I'm in town for business, staying at the Hampton Inn across the street.     Busy Sunday and was seated in the bar.   Probably the worst service I have ever had in a Friday's!   Almost totally ignored by the female server.   I guess single male diners aren't worth her effort!  I had to go to the bar to get silverware... was checked on once, long after I had finished.  Suddenly she appeared and got friendly!  Time to try to earn  a tip! Zero service = zero tip.    Bartender  offered desert because he knew I was upset... too little too late.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Carl F.,"Effingham, IL",65,382,424,2.0,8/3/2016,"In my opinion this location needs a complete overhaul.   It's of the older layouts and they really do need to get this one remodeled to the new set up.  The inside is really showing it's age, especially the tables and chairs.  The bathrooms... well, lets just say go in there ""after"" you eat.     I find the menus are overly tattered, sticky, and missing pages.    The wait staff are okay. They take your order, no real attempt to connect with you and running from table to table.  Generally as sign of being understaffed.    The food quality is lacking, and presentation is just not there.    Clearly slapped, or glopped onto the plate with no care or pride in what goes out the kitchen door.     My suggestion is if you are going to come here, stick with the hamburgers and ""don't"" get the steaks.  Ribs are hit or miss.    The appetizers are okay, perhaps the best item on the menu here.  My impression with this location is the owner has made his money from this place a long time ago and has no intentions of sinking any funds for improvements, acquiring better cooks, or hiring on extra wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Heather M.,"Effingham, IL",6,31,12,5.0,6/22/2017,"This is our go to nice sitdown restaurant; their menus fresh and constantly changing. They always have drink specials and appetizers. Employees are super friendly and aim to please. Allowing substitutions here and there; usually for no additional charge. We can't go wrong with this restaurant, especially since our Ruby Tuesday's went out of business. They are open late and usually it doesn't take too long to get a table even on the busiest of nights. Highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Brad P.,"Springfield, MO",31,159,118,2.0,11/28/2016,"It's really not this location's fault. But if it's not a burger or they can't fry it, you shouldn't order it to eat at TGI Fridays. I ordered the bourbon barrel mahi mahi. I think I've had a better piece of grilled fish microwaved out of a banquet frozen dinner box.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Scott W.,"Kewanee, IL",0,11,4,1.0,3/4/2017,"This place sucks. I had the French Onion soup which is generally decent at TGIF, it had NO ONIONS, NO CHEESE and a very weak broth run far, far away......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Timothy B.,"Chesterfield, MO",54,43,3,4.0,5/14/2017,"Always great food, love the BBQ ribs, fries and green fry beans. We love the lemonade and non alcoholic drinks. This location is always well maintained. We always come on a Saturday evening when it is crowded. This particular time we had 7 people. We were served quickly although the service was not a dive the entire time. Everyone was very friendly though",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Denise H.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,58,17,5.0,10/15/2016,We were greeted upon entering.  We sat at the bar.  Bartender were courteous and efficient. Food came out quickly and as ordered.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Meg E.,"Festus, MO",0,9,,1.0,6/15/2017,"I wish I'd read the reviews before we stopped. We were looking for something easy, right off the highway, with decent variety. Friday's is always a fairly safe bet. This location was disgusting. It was humid, smelled bad, and everything was sticky. I wish franchises did more to monitor affiliated locations.  The one star is for our wait person, Savannah. She was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Trudy B.,"Olney, IL",36,4,,4.0,5/26/2017,"Good food, great service. We had the endless $10 apps and soup and salad. Or waitress was attentive and very sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Dan F.,"Watson, IL",1,3,,2.0,4/16/2017,"Definition of hit or miss. Came here about two months ago and ordered one of their famous drinks (not on menu), came back today and was told they can't make that drink,even better, no one had ever heard of that drink... Best thing about these chains is that one can usually expect a new face. Turn over rate seems high, and service seems low.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Holly D.,"Effingham, IL",0,3,1,4.0,2/28/2017,Mhm! So delicious! I had the jack Daniels bourbon chicken and a brownie obsession that lives up to its expectations lol great service and always a great atmosphere here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2

Dax B.,"Lake of the Ozarks, MO",19,10,,5.0,3/22/2015,Ok try the long island iced tea. Jeremy's an awesome bartender. As an appetizer I recommend the put stickers yes I know everywhere else they're not good but here they're awesome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
John S.,"Chesterfield, MO",1,15,5,3.0,12/16/2015,"I ended up eating here twice within two days. Not on purpose, but just by chance because I was traveling through town. Overall the food is average, but I will say stay away from the French dip. Today I had  the French dip and it was like chewing on cardboard when I opened up the sandwich half the sandwich was just fat. It was really bad. Also had broccoli cheddar soup, but that was really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2
Robert C.,"Tinley Park, IL",0,73,,4.0,11/8/2014,"Visited on 10/26/14.  Server:  Alyssa M.   Good Service.   Good Burgers.   Good place to visit off I-57 and recharge when you do not know ""where the Effingham are we"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2?start=20

Dominique W.,"Springfield, MO",0,1,,1.0,5/2/2015,I will not stop here again. The staff was rude and we waited for an hour before someone came to get our drink order. No one was friendly. Food was not great either. Way overpriced for food that sucks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2?start=20

Scott V.,"Du Quoin, IL",0,15,2,5.0,8/23/2014,Always one of my favorite places to stop when my son and i go to Chicago once a year. Great food and atmosphere! Wish there was one a little farther south in Southern Illinois!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2?start=20
Samantha G.,"Fairfield, IL",1,7,1,2.0,8/1/2014,"Good service, friendly staff, quickly served. Very disappointing food. Poorly plated. Appetizer was much smaller than expected, we did not receive all of the dips, bland flavors. I order a strawberry field salad, berries were old and tasteless, salad was flat looked disappointing on plate & did not receive my dressing. Not much food overall. Husband got the American cheeseburger & fries. Tastes bland. He said he would have rather got a $5 Burger King. We will not be going back. Not worth the extra money. Mediocre overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2?start=20
Katherine T.,"San Antonio, TX",91,508,37,3.0,9/16/2013,Typical and predictable. I had the brownie dessert as recommended by our waitress. I've had better. Pretty packed even on a weekday. No complaints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2?start=20
Mandi D.,"Pocahontas, IL",0,11,,3.0,2/13/2013,"Normally they're food is just fine. But nothing mouth watering. This last visit me and my bf both orders ribeyes the same doneness (medium) His came rare and mine came done. He ate his and I sent mine back. It came back rare. So I sent it back again, it came back too quickly to be refired. My bf had been done eating for 10 minutes and I was just done with the whole ordeal so we left without me eating. We hit Taco Bell after leaving. The worst part was that the employees didn't seem concerned at all, like I was just a nuisance for wanting my ribeye the way I ordered it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-effingham-2?start=20
