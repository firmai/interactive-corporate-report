Tyler S.,"Raynham, MA",4,1,,1.0,3/7/2015,"We ordered a 3 choice appatizer: boneless buffalo wings ( looked more like nuggets and they were cold), loaded potato skins w/extra bacon ( didn't come with bacon, was cold and no where near loaded) & fried green beans(were good) Mom ordered a steak and sweet potato fries, fries were cold.  Don't get me started on my meal and then the replacement meal.   Only the dessert was good.

Michael M.,"New Bedford, MA",1,9,,2.0,8/13/2013,"This place is everything thats dumb about chain restaurants. Where to begin? The portrait of the Munsters staring at me as we eat? The techno thumping in the men's pisser? The 18 year old server terrified of customers and who clearly was told to push the Stripes memberships (yeah thats what I need, more spam--BTW enjoy the emails and phone calls mom;) And oh yeah--the food. Gotta love 15-page menus. No bueno. The Jack Daniels chicken sandwich? Meh. Iceberg lettuce in a chain skeeves me out. The fries were straight outta da bag in da freeza. The JD dipping sauce? Well, honestly you'd be better served giving me a shot of the real stuff and letting me dunk my bread in that Vavo style instead of the sticky mess I got with my meal.

Kevin M.,"East Taunton, MA",106,160,72,3.0,7/27/2014,"Just a basic overpriced franchise restaurant. Fridays was the place to go years ago. Place was empty empty when I took my family. Service was a little slow. Ordered a burger which was good, though sent the fries back to the kitchen as those were cold. $11 for a burger should have hot crispy fries not fries sittings under a heat lamp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton?start=20
Jimmy J.,"Raynham, MA",1,19,,5.0,2/1/2015,"First time we've been to a TGI Fridays in years. Went because we had a gift card and took our 3 year old. Was pleasantly surprised with this place.. Was seated promptly, waitress was very friendly and attentive. And the food was a lot better than expected. We have stopped going to the 99 Restaurants because there food has gone down hill over the years.  Gave this a 5 star based on the fact that it's a chain restaurant and exceeded our expectations.

I've been to my fair share of these chain restaurants and I cannot say that I have one complaint about the food. I'm a regular customer and I usually find myself getting the sizzling chicken and cheese or the Jack Daniels baby back ribs. Fridays has the best Jack Daniels sauce I have ever tried!

I had a great experience my most recent time at the bar. Great pot stickers and my dinner came out on time, hot and awesome! I got the Japanese hibachi steak which was very flavorful, definitely a good plate to try!

Shannon F.,"Westport, MA",163,450,501,4.0,8/9/2013,"I came here with a general knowledge of what I could and could not eat.  I mean, even if I forget if the spinach dip has chicken stock, I know I can always have the flatbread and a black bean burger as a vegetarian.  Last night The bartender was SO nice and brought out their new allergen menu.  This menu is coded with little symbols for shellfish, milk, wheat, eggs and other things that people may not eat or be allergic to.  Funny enough, everything on the menu had the shellfish symbol next to it except for one thing:  The flatbread.  How is this possible a black bean burger has shellfish in it?  This unnerved me slightly, until the manager came out with the black bean burger ingredients and assured me that there was no shellfish in there at all.  In fact, they were Morningstar farms products.  The manager didn't have to come out and talk to me at all, so I feel that was excellent customer service.  They have wifi now at this location.  But My phone wasn't holding a connection the day I was there, and there were two other people around me that their phone wasn't holding it either.  So much for wifi!  Otherwise a typical Fridays, with crazy things on the walls, and a really strange path through the kitchen to get to the bathroom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton?start=20
Jim P.,"Taunton, MA",0,7,,4.0,8/31/2013,"I have come to consider this place as one of the best eating places in the Taunton area. It has a nice atmosphere and their menu is better than most in the area. I have had my problems in the past, like cold mashed potatoes, but this was during a time they were very busy and they did correct the problem when we complained. I do not go to restaurants that are crowded anymore, so all my visits here have been pleasant. I will go here again when I want a nice meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton?start=20
Kyle O.,"Miami, FL",66,87,10,1.0,12/23/2012,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet as I don't like to review chains but everyone should be warned. Came here with my mom after Christmas shopping at the mall last week. We went in around 930. The service was awful, I don't remember her name but she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her by being there.  Miserable looks throughout  the dinner.  Ask for blue cheese side, look of death in return. Not to mention the burger I had was the WORST burger I've ever had in my life. It looked like crap. The bun was soggy and I had to force myself to eat it. They can't cook the burgers to your liking because they are frozen. So my medium rare burger was well done. The quality of the patty resembled something  that you get served at a public high school. The patty just looked gross when I cut into it. I would have rather went to Wendy's.  The waitress was never around. I won't be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton?start=20
Andrew K.,"Raynham, MA",0,1,,5.0,8/22/2015,"If every experience I had at a restaurant was as good as this, I don't think I would ever eat at home. Our waiter Dave was one of the best waiters I have had at a restaurant, not only did he have some fantastic locks of love, but his personality and sense of humor were also fantastic. I got the unlimited appetizers and ordered 6 dishes in total. The first thing I ordered were the sriracha potato skins, these were one of the two VERY good dishes that I had. My second order was the mozzarella sticks, this was the second VERY good dish. The next thing I ordered was the spicy chicken tostada, these were meh at best. My fourth and fifth plate were both boneless wings, the first being buffalo and the second being ghost pepper. Both of the wings were tasty. My last order was the garlic and basil flatbread, this was also pretty good. In conclusion, four of the six appetizers were great, one was ok and the other was meh. All of the dishes were aesthetically pleasing though, so that was a plus. TGI Fridays in Taunton gets a 5/5 from me. I will certainly go there again :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton?start=20

John R.,"Attleboro, MA",0,19,,1.0,2/13/2013,"My daughter picked this place to try, I ordered the Hibachi steak, what a huge mistake, dry little burnt shards of meat on a stick, they were so small and so hard it was nearly impossible to chew them down, the waitress took the order and brought the drinks, disappeared for a long time after that. Could not even send the food back because there was no server to do so.. No refill to help get down the burn chards of beef. Took forever to get a check and get out.

Burn W.,"Taunton, MA",6,67,3,2.0,3/6/2009,"I've eaten at this TGI Fridays before, and had a much better experience than I did this evening.  The food was ok, though not as good as previous visits.  The music wasn't the normal fare either.  It sounded like they swapped out the corporate-approved music with someone's personal Michael Jackson collection, as most of the songs played were his.  Some of the waitstaff danced and sang to Jackson songs to the point of attracting attention from quite a number of patrons.  Definitely not my idea of professional behavior.  I wouldn't exactly write the place off, but if I have a similar experience in the future, I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton?start=20

Pete C.,"Newark, NJ",0,2,,1.0,8/28/2012,"I usually enjoy TGI Fridays (especially the north Dartmouth location). This was my first time to Taunton and expected the same great service/food. WRONG!!! Sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon  Bartender was awful. She (Sam was her name) must have have been very displeased to be at work or hungover. She did the bare minimum to satisfy my needs, had to ask twice for water. Food came out and was cold never was asked how anything was so didn't have a chance to tell her. Never offered a second drink when mine was empty. She was not even behind the bar for a total of 5 minutes during my 1/2 hot stay. It was not busy in the restaurant at all....I could tell because two servers were eating at a bar table in their Fridays uniform in-between visiting their tables. I will continue to visit the ND location but never Taunton. Maybe some re-training or perhaps some management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton?start=20
Tyler P.,"New Bedford, MA",9,116,,5.0,8/17/2008,"I love going to big steakhouse chain restaurants because they can give you the most funniest time ever (because of disgust!!), or, just feel good.  I personally enjoyed this TGI Fridays...It actually did'nt suck!  The atmosphere was fun. On the walls, there were old pictures, vintage toys(literally, there were old toboggan's in the wall!).  I got the California club. It was amazing. I was surprized it was from a chain restaurant. It had bacon,chicken,lettuce, and mayonaise(i don't like mayonaise, but it blended in with the sandwhich.)  The prices were really good too. My sandwhich (and all other sandwhich's) were about 8 dollars.  The waitress was really,really nice.Almost to the point where I thought she had Tourette's (even I think that last one was cold!)

Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565,4.0,2/25/2017,"As a whole company, TGI Fridays is one of my favorite chain restaurants tied with Chili's and a few others. In this section of Taunton (near the mall), there aren't all that many restaurant options that appealed to me. Sure UNO's and Papa Gino's are good, but I wasn't in the mood for pizza, and up until recently I didn't even know what Smokey Bones was, so I ended up coming here for lunch, on both occasions when I have been in Taunton. And telling from the other reviews (especially in comparison to other Friday's), they are accurate that this one is just slightly better than some of the others.  There are definitely some other locations that are newer and nicer, but in total, my experiences here have been wonderful and definitely worthy of four stars. Especially in comparison to my experience in the Mansfield location where it was just problem after problem after problem (check out that Yelp page!). Anyway, waiters and waitresses here are friendly and the restaurant is widespread in that it looks small from the outside but inside is huge. They have more tables than most other chain restaurants of the type and more booths too. I find the decor to be entertaining and enriching the experience of TGI overall. In general, this location was extremely clean and seems well kept. Bathrooms were also sparkling. Parking lot is large and never that loaded with cars.  Food is good. Best things on the menu are the burgers, sandwiches, and those brownie desserts (the best).  I have no complaints about this TGI Fridays and highly suggest it as a very good restaurant for families or for anyone else. The bar is also fine.  Location of this restaurant is sort of weird, being off the main road, but it works since there is a shopping center across the street.  4 stars for TGI in Taunton. Good enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-taunton
Bre M.,"Boston, MA",6,6,,1.0,12/1/2017,Ordered a rack of ribs online and was sent an email that said they'd be ready in 20 minutes. Once my husband arrived to pick up the food he was told that they ran out of ribs. Really?!? Mmmmk so I was given the option to select something diff. Went with the jack daniels burger bc that's usually a safe option at this location that usually finds a nice way to frig up your order.

We could have sworn that our server was under some sort of influence.

Katy K.,"Lewisberry, PA",18,12,,1.0,9/2/2017,"8 of us arrived at 7:30pm for our reservation and we left at 9:45pm with only half of the entrees we ordered. Our waiter took forever to come take our order. We flagged him down and he said he was backed up and would be with us. The manager came 5 minutes later and took everyone's order, which we assumed she had put in. Our waiter came by later and said ""I am gonna put these in for you."" After 35 minutes with no food yet, we asked for a status update. Food was then brought out for only 6 of us, AND portions of the plates were not warm, or under/overcooked. Two of us had steamed spinach as a side-one was cooked properly and the other literally had raw leaf spinach on the plate. The rice pilaf was actually chilled, not room temperature. One of our party has been in the foodservice industry for 10 years and brought some plates to the manager, who comped everyone's meals, but seemed unapologetic at best. By this time we STILL were missing 2 whole meals and the two plates that we sent back to be warmed or spinach cooked. We paid for our drinks and the waiter never once apologized for the poor service.

We waited for 10 minutes before she approached us and took our drink order and appetizer order (3 waters and a Dr Pepper and the potato skins with the jack Daniels wings) our drinks were brought 10-15 minutes later and our appetizers were brought with plates and NO SILVERWARE OR NAPKINS. Also, by the time we got our appetizers we had ordered our food and our drinks needed refills....which we waited 30 more minutes for. When our food did arrive, my steak had been cooked on one side only and my friend's smokehouse stacker burger was missing the peppers, onions, sausage and bacon.

We also understand working as waitstaff can get incredibly hectic. We get it. It is not entirely the wait staff's fault that we had an awful experience we had recently. We got out after closing OG at 11pm and walked over to order apps. I ordered nachos, he ordered a burger and sweet potato fries. Ordered no later than 11:25pm as listed on receipt. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Bartenders both asking if we need anything and a few times we asked how much longer for food. Told ""a few more minutes"" every time. These two ladies next to us are asked by a bartender, ""you ordered food, right?"" they look increasingly angry and reply ""yes...awhile ago?!?!"" the bartender logs into the system and sees the order was never sent... These were people who were sitting bar top AGES before we got there. 12:00 midnight rolls around and we finally get our food. I look to see my boyfriend has a whopping 9 sweet potato fries. He bites into one and it's hard and undercooked! My nachos are soggy and unbelievably cold. We walk back in and talk to a manager. He basically asked us what we wanted him to do and never really offered an apology. However, he offered to remake my nachos and make more fries for my boyfriend. He claims he could have them done in 4 minutes. Now, I get how busy the linecooks can be but there were 3 tables and a couple ladies at the bar... Why did they take an hour before????? Anyways, we got the properly cooked food and left. I might not come back for awhile.
