John H.,"Lubbock, TX",8,98,2,1.0,12/15/2013,"Some of the absolute worst food to ever be served in a restaurant.  The service was decent which is the only reason it gets a star.  Save your money, eat elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2?start=20
Elle E.,"Lubbock, TX",0,109,2,2.0,12/28/2014,"Our trip to Chili's was OK.  Servers and host were all friendly.  Food was good.  The problem was the lack of attention to the task at hand.  The servers kept watching the football game, and the kitchen staff were as well...as was proven time and again by cheers and groans loud enough that we could hear them.  Also, the kitchen staff's music was loud enough to compete with the front of house music.  Between the competing music, the cheering (or moans and groans) the servers watching the game and the typical chatter, it was not a very pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2?start=20
Robyn S.,"Lubbock, TX",36,7,,4.0,2/10/2016,We always order carry out and each time our food is amazing and the people to check us out very friendly! Keep up the good work!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2?start=20
Lindsey L.,"Langwood, Houston, TX",82,21,2,1.0,3/7/2015,Worst chilis I've ever been to. Really dirty and the waiters are awful. Went for dessert one night on a date and we sat there 10 min and no one came to our table. We ended up walking out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2?start=20
Chelby P.,"Amarillo, TX",2,1,,1.0,4/8/2014,I have an open mind with food only tried chilis 4 times and the one time I go to this one it is the worst experience ever! My boyfriend and I have just often off work and want to eat so being that we do by want to cook chilis is what we treat ourselves and this particularly go to this one we like the on on university and so to try this one out since we are closer we go there. The service was horrible I ordered a lemonade and they gave me a coke then a water and the waiter poured my boyfriends drink on the table and didn't clean it up now that's bad but when the general manager doesn't want to take action and has an attitude? Oh yeah right! We left so quick! It was awful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2?start=20
W S.,"Austin, TX",12,150,9,3.0,8/16/2011,"Sometimes, traveling requires dispensing with your elitist sensibilities and making do with what is available.  We bought camping supplies at Walmart because that was the only place in Grants, New Mexico that had what we needed.  And tonight we had dinner at a Chili's in Lubbock because it was open until 11pm and was a better place to take kids than a pricy restaurant or a bar.   I had a plate with four mini-burgers, the kids had pizza, chicken, and a corn dog, and my wife had ribs.  Her margarita was too sweet but otherwise everything was ok. The waiters were friendly and our food arrived promptly despite a surprisingly big crowd.  I'm as guilty as the next food snob wannabe about turning up my nose at Chili's, but under the circumstances it was A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2?start=20
Nathan H.,"Lubbock, TX",127,374,383,1.0,8/23/2010,"People keep talking highly about Chili's and I cannot figure out why.  I ordered the Southern Smokehouse Burger and was reasonably surprised by how much I liked it. I thought to myself, I finally get to change my opinion of Chilis... then it happened. I had polished off my glass of tea for the four or five time and had it setting by my plate waiting for a refill. As the waiter picked it up something caught my eye on the bottom of the glass resting comfortably below the ice. About 8 looooong black hairs were curled up in a ball in the bottom on the cup; being a guy with very short brown hair I felt comfortable saying that they were not mine. As the waiter began to fill the tea I noticed something else, there was red lipstick on the edge. Again, being a GUY with very short brown hair I felt comfortable saying that it wasn't mine.  Basically, some bus boy cleaned this glass off of somebodies table and handed it directly to our server to give to me. Regardless of how good the food is, and I was reasonable impressed on this visit, you cannot finish a meal after realizing you drank some chicks hair and lipstick. 2/3 of a burger and corn on the cob went to waste on that meal, even if paying with a gift card it's not worth stopping by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2?start=20
Cheryl M.,"Grapevine, TX",14,26,1,1.0,7/8/2012,"We ate a late lunch around 4:15. Ordered one soup, one soup and salad , and shrimp tacos. The soups came out 15 minutes later. We waited another 15-20 minutes for my sons shrimp tacos . I almost complained to Manager but my kids said no. The salad came out same time as tacos and was terrible . The lettuce was wilted and had brown pieces in and the cucumbers were not fresh. Terrible service and food .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2?start=20
Mike L.,"Strafford, MO",1938,154,845,4.0,12/14/2017,"Although I checked Yelp before we came to Chili's for fajitas, I overlooked the two star rating  and was extremely happy I did ! ! The chicken fajitas with beans and rice were delicious. Huge amount of chicken which was perfectly prepared!  Absolutely as good as any Mexican restaurant in Lubbock!! We also tried guacamole with chips and salsa. I give It a B+ with all ingredients fresh and tasty.  The waiter was also attentive, friendly and helpful. Simply outstanding service and food!!  I will be back soon and must rate this a 4 star experience ! ! Bravo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Cynthia W.,"Las Cruces, NM",131,4,,3.0,10/15/2017,"Service was very accommodating, but a little slow. Food was good and the price was right. Location helps this restaurant a great deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
William P.,"Lubbock, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/10/2017,"Our waiter was Matthew & he was great! The food was so-so, I had the fajitas, they were smothered in cilantro, I was not crazy about that. The onions were not caramelized or soft. My son had the steak quesadilla & there was a hair on his plate! Very disgusting! The place felt out-of-date & dirty! There was kid smears on the inside of the window & the table tablets (aka: table top entertainment center) were disgustingly filthy with grime on the back side & smears on the screens.And to cap it off, as we were leaving the restaurant, we saw a cockroach running across the floor!! My son & I will NOT be going back there to eat!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Greg B.,"Lubbock, TX",6,7,2,2.0,11/26/2016,"Went by Saturday after Thanksgiving at 7:50 pm. Two adults, two kids.  The table top entertainment center was filthy. Asked server to help us by cleaning so kid could play. She was helpful.  We ordered a specialty drink, never delivered. Three of our four orders were delivered incorrect.  From their kid's menu, we ordered a grilled cheese and kernel corn. We received corn on cob and a cold grilled cheese. Little hard for a two year old to eat corn on cob. Took ten minutes to get the kernel corn.   Both adults orders were served wrong.   Never saw a manager. Server and server's ""helper"" never asked if the order was correct. Had to run  them down for correcting mistakes in order and for refills.  Not the level of service I expect from Brinkner properties. Pretty disappointing all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Matthew E.,"Wichita Falls, TX",0,5,,1.0,7/20/2016,"Most disappointing Chili's experience EVER.  Quite possibly the worst Chili's in the U.S. Monday night visit for some simple soup and salad.  Who'd have thought that someone could possibly mess that up... Honestly, how long does it take to dump a bag of shitty salad greens on a plate, sprinkle with tomatoes and serve? Waitress was SUPER inattentive.  Drinks ran out several times.  The bottomless soup and salad wasn't worth ordering refills because it would take an hour. Stay away from this Chili's.  Go to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Davis M.,"Lubbock, TX",13,14,1,2.0,8/15/2017,"This is usually a consistent restaurant, today not good. I had a party of 6 - waited 15 min for a table. It then took an hr to get food. Service was friendly but very slow!! Especially with children! The food was meh -& lukewarm. The French fries were warm & especially good according to the kids .Waiter thought to refill drinks after 40 minutes. Had to flag someone else down to get a ticket. Not happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
J P.,"Lubbock, TX",0,6,,5.0,4/26/2017,"I don't know about the night-time experiences, but they do a great job at lunch during the weekdays. I eat there every week with a couple of good friends. The wait staff has always been great, no matter whom we had serve us. They all know us by name and fight over serving us. Food is always good as well and we do not have to wait on it.  Thanks Debbie, Missy, Evan, Eric, Matthew, Marisa, Spencer, etc. for making our lunches a pleasant experience each week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Anna H.,"Levelland, TX",208,46,98,5.0,9/8/2016,"Typically, I try not to do chain restaurants simply because I try to support local businesses wherever I go. However, we had a work related gathering today at Chili's, and I could not have been more pleased with our service. Our waiter was attentive and also very personable. I know it can be difficult to tend to a large group, but he did a great job and had a good attitude. We also were all pleased with our food and drink choices, and the atmosphere wasn't bad either. They've really done a great job of regularly updating their building and menu over the years, so it's never a bad experience. They also provided a free dessert to the girl whose birthday we were celebrating! Thanks, Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Janet S.,"Lubbock, TX",1,12,,1.0,11/23/2016,"Used take-out...food tasted so old trashed it.  I ordered chicken and also quesadillas, both tasted old....Good-by Chilis from me.  Called manager to report, he offered coupons, but I declined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Christopher L.,"Wolfforth, TX",5,15,2,4.0,7/22/2016,"The food is standard chilis fare but our server was awesome. Matthew is by far one of the best servers I have had. We had chips and salsa and he refilled them and our drinks several times right on point. Must be a mind reader, or just really good at his job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Kristen W.,"Lubbock, TX",43,28,19,3.0,6/24/2015,"The only reason I gave this a 3, instead of a 2, was because our waiter was friendly/not pushy/helpful at refilling glasses. However the food was sub-par. My quesadilla had the thinnest layer of shredded chicken for something not cheap or an appetizer. Someone else in my party mentioned their steak having a strange flavor. Lastly, sometimes the place has an issue with cleanliness (in the main area, not in the bathrooms) such as when I received some dirty wrapped silverware or sticky tables. Just some small things that make all the difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Shelbie B.,"Alvarado, TX",0,6,,1.0,4/19/2016,"I called Chili's to get a to-go order. I was on hold so long that I decided to just drive to Chili's and when I got there I was still on hold. As I'm about to walk someone answers and couldn't answer basic questions and didn't seem like he cared that he had put me on hold forever. I order the California flat bread. I stressed to them at least 3 or 4 times not to put pico. I waited a good while for my food and when I finally got it I asked them are you sure they did not put pico and the guy flat out lied and said I watched them to make sure they didn't put pico. I, in a hurry left and when I went to eat the flatbread there was pico all over the flatbread. I'm annoyed that the guy put me on hold, that there was pico on my flatbread but mostly I'm just really annoyed that the guy straight up lied to me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Matt S.,"Levelland, TX",49,119,71,3.0,10/22/2014,"Despite all the negative reviews about poor service, my server was actually pretty good. My cup stayed full, it didn't have lipstick or strange wads of hair, my order was correct, and actually tasted pretty good. Could it have been better? yes. But it was a decent visit, and I'm sure I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Kevin B.,"Lubbock, TX",0,1,,2.0,12/3/2015,Now I see why this location only has 2 stars.  Very slow from taking the order to delivering the food. And the food delivered wasn't even correct. I'm not sure we'll be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Alyse S.,"Austin, TX",1,5,,1.0,4/19/2015,May add new post. Service is on point for being SLAMMED. Obviously an administrative/management issue.  Been here since 6pm. An hour and a half later we have had initial appetizers but no salads and server is struggling to keep up with refills. Because her section is insanely HUGE. Food came out decent. Contacted manager as even my salad was horrific. We've been here for 2 hours. Just barely finishing. Manager didn't stop by to see hour our food came out.  This is *not* a server issue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Oscar D.,"Hawley, TX",3,38,17,4.0,7/18/2015,Good service and the Tables side Guac is the bomb. Got to try the Bacon Avocado chicken sandwich. Food is good and reasonably priced.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Angela S.,"Ames, IA",0,10,5,3.0,3/12/2016,We went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasnt very busy. The service was average and the food was okay. We had 4 mini burger meal with fries and shrimp alferado...both were okay. Nothing to come back about.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Patrick C.,"Lubbock, TX",19,18,,1.0,4/24/2013,"I joined   specifically to review this restaurant.  My 7yo daughter is particularly fond of Chili's for some reason. She loves the queso, which is a favorite of mine as well. Really, all the food is okay. It's Chili's. Everyone has been to a Chili's. Everyone knows the menu - the baby back ribs, the burgers and Awesome Blossum. The food is decent. It's the food you would expect on a high school date after a Friday night football game. Just decent. Nothing to rave. In fact, if out of town looking for a restaurant, it would more than likely be the last on your list of choices.  The reason I felt the urgency to write a review: This particular Chili's is the worst. It is horribly understaffed; the service is consistently slow; and, whether a weekday or Thanksgiving weekend, the service is always bad. Never great. Rarely good. Frequently bad.   Tonight, in particular, after dance practice, my daughter requested dinner out at Chili's. Upon arrival, half the parking lot was full on this Wednesday night yet the entry way was filled with about fifteen people waiting. No one was available to greet or assist for five minutes. Finally, a young man returned to his post and asked our party number. He told us the wait time would be around five additional minutes. We sat on a bench facing into the dining area. I counted four empty tables, covered in dirty plates, half-filled glasses and discarded napkins. I then counted the wait staff. Amazingly, the number of aforementioned tables was greater than wait staff. After five minutes grew to fifteen, even my daughter was no longer enchanted with Chili's. We left, and, if my choice going forward, will not return, ever.  I would understand the staffing issues if this restaurant was in a small town with one or two places to dine. Quite the opposite here. We live in a major college town with several high schools; the restaurant is in the center of a large shopping and entertainment district; and it is surrounded by many, many, many restaurants. All those considered, this Chili's is ALWAYS understaffed. Horribly understaffed. Other restaurants in the area never seem this unorganized.  I doubt anyone reads this review, because, again, Chili's is Chili's; everyone knows what to expect from Chili's. However, should you come to this particular restaurant, be prepared to wait, for a table, to order, for refills, for food, for the check, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
Bill S.,"Dallas, TX",81,348,33,2.0,2/17/2012,"Yes, it's a major chain restaurant which I usually try to avoid, but I'm in Lubbock on business and not sure where to go for a decent meal.  When in doubt I usually stick with Chili's because the food is always predictably average, and when I'm traveling sometimes that's just fine. This Chili's though needs some help.  I ate there twice in a 24 hour period this past week and was very disappointed each time.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken pasta and it was delivered cold and with very little sauce or seasoning. I went there for lunch the next day in hope that my dinner experience was a fluke.  Nope, still bad.  Got the Margarita chicken and it was dry and swimming in a plate surrounded by black beans.  Strange. I don't know where to suggest to go in Lubbock for a decent meal, but steer clear of this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
A M.,"Lubbock, TX",0,13,,1.0,6/16/2015,"At one point I really enjoyed coming here, but it has gone completely downhill. Service is terrible regardless of what time you come. Take out is even worse, multiple times i've had food missing, including an entire meal not put in, which I had to drive all the way back to pick up. Don't go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lubbock-2
