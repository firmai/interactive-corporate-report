First time I came here, My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer along with entrees. So, basically they came out together! Worse part was, the waitress wanted to take our entrees back so we could have time to eat our appetizer. I refused! I was worried what would happen to our food while it was waiting...... That same visit, she messed up our bill and didn't even apologize.  The second time, I went to see if this place could redeem themselves; but yet again a disappointment.  We were seated in the far back next to a broken soda machine. It was dingy and dark and smelled really bad. We stayed there though because it was packed and we didn't want to be THOSE customers. (if you know what I mean) The food is sub par. It is basically like an Applebee's with a different twist. I like the pot stickers the most.  This particular location needs new management.

The service is pretty good, as the manager can often be found walking around the restaurant checking on people's meals. They try to accomodate whatever needs your group may have even if it means moving around certain parts of the restaurants so everyone in your party can be seated together.  The food is decent.

We expected that he, or someone would be back immediately to clean up the puddle of water I was surrounded by, but none did until my husband flagged someone down. Unfortunately they left one part of the floor soaking wet, and when my 5 year old daughter decided to get up from her chair to come over to me, she slipped and fell hard on her back and hit her head.  Of course, she began crying loudly. None came to see what was wrong!  My husband again had to flag someone down to finish drying the floor. After all that had happened you would think they would have taken a substantial amount off the bill as an apology for the HORRENDOUS service, but the waiter handed us the bill with the full amount on it!!!!!!!!   Oh, and of course, the service was slow and the waiter mixed up our orders!!!!!!!!  How do they stay in business!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=100,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
92,Ricky W.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",0,2,,2.0,2013-03-17,"So I got a 20% off coupon yesterday in my e-mail, so we figured it would be a cool idea to use it at one of our more liked restaurants.  I realize people mainly review to post negative comments, but this was pretty bad. We came in and were seated right away, at an empty restaurant.  Our waitress took ten minutes to get to us and ask for our desired orders, saying she wasn't our waitress, before walking away for another 5 minutes before getting our drinks, at which point we decided on an appetizer. We got the three for all, potato skins, wings, and potstickers, after she told us fried mozzarella was one of only two things other than potato skins, until saying ""there's more than three choices"" jogged her memory a little. We get our appetizer, and two of the potato skins are small rounded things a third the size of normal.  Shrugging it off, our meals finally arrive.  I get a 6 inch by 3 inch 8 oz. Medium yet somehow completely burnt Flat Iron, two small ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes, and four Parmesan fries.  I ask to see the manager, and instead of going to fetch him she proceeds to spend 5 minutes to converse with some other, freshly seated and very rowdy people. The manager proceeds to tell me the sizes are normal and that she was actually our waitress, blaming it on ""no two are alike"" akin to Subway, completely refusing to take it off. This was a disappointing meal consisting of a waitress that felt she was right, a refusal to accept something that could have been easily remedied, and a waste of time because of incompetence.  I've eaten here many times and it was a lot better than it was today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=80,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504

94,Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,861,26.0,2.0,2014-03-23,"2 stars is actually being pretty generous here.  After a traffic filled trip to Long Island, my wife and I were in the area and had about an hour to kill.  Needing a drink, I was pleasantly surprised to see a TGI Friday's right on Northern Blvd.  As an FYI, there's a pretty massive parking lot behind the building.  That was pretty nice. We walked in and were able to snag a table right by the bar.  Unfortunately, one of the bartenders also doubled up as our waitress.  She was pretty busy but also pretty inattentive.  That's not exactly a winning combination.  It took us a while to get our check when we finally wanted to go.  I started out with a Sam Adams on tap - the taps did not taste clean.  I hate that - never a good sign.  For my 2nd beer, I switched over to a different brew hoping these taps didn't taste as bad.  No such luck.  I was pretty disappointed as I love draft beer but I just couldn't do it.   I had to switch over to a bottle - can't deal with the ""unfresh"" tasting taps.  My wife and I did put in for an order of the pretzel sticks that come with a beer cheese dipping sauce.  I have to give them credit - these pretzel sticks are pretty good.  I've had them a few times now and they are definitely a good appetizer.  If it wasn't for the food tasting pretty on point, I'd probably go with a 1-star rating.  Drinks were a miss but the food was solid.  And, to top it off, this particular Friday's is actually priced noticeably higher than the ones we go to in NJ.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=80,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.568,2.76

It seems like it was sitting around for a while. Appetizers: Fried Green Beans - They were good. Not the best I've had, but I would recommend if you've never had this dish. Tuscan spinach dip - Very solid and safe appetizer. Recommended. BBQ Chicken Flatbread - It was okay, not that great. Flat bread was okay, but it's not good when it's warm. Jack Daniel's Flat Iron Steak - This 8 oz steak was ordered as Medium Rare and it came out as Medium Rare. The outside was not burnt, but cooked to perfection. I highly recommend the steak.

Anyway, I will say that generally speaking, they make good burgers and their Jack Daniels sauce is fabulous.  As a rule, service is very slow.  These are the norms.  However, every once in a while, they make the big mistake as you can read in some of the one and two star reviews below.   My story of today is that I ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler.  The fried shrimp came out uncooked.  Not undercooked.  Uncooked!  It was ice cold and the shrimps were brown on the inside - not white.  The reason I couldn't tell from the first bite is that the Jack Daniels sauce was very cold as well.  It took two bites for me to figure it out.  So they brought me a new set of shrimp and they happened to bring out another little dip cup of the Jack Daniels sauce and again it was really cold.  So I spoke to the manager and said that I didn't understand the purpose of bringing a dipping sauce that felt about 40 degrees as a dip for a hot dish featuring ribs, chicken tenders and fried shrimp.  What was the point???  The sauce should be room temperature at worst.  The manager advised that yes the sauce was in fact 44 degrees and comes straight from the refrigerator!!  Crazy!  When I commented that I thought this didn't sound like a smart process, he took it to the microwave and had it heated for me which made me feel like I was being a difficult customer but really..........why would they bring 44 degree sauce as standard procedure for a hot dish?

They pretty much used one potato skin and cut it into four pieces. Say what?!  The buffalo wings were not spicy at all and looked greasy. The best two were the pretzel bread and mozzarella sticks. The bread was soft and warm. The portion was large enough to share with four adults (two sticks).

57,Frank M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",158,118,970.0,5.0,2016-08-25,"Have been to this TGI Fridays many times and it has been very good most of the time. I am a stripes member and my wife and i had come on a Saturday night with our coupon and Friday's stripe card. I had initially ordered a Lava Flow specialty drink which didn't care for and asked to change it to a $5 Long Island Iced Tea special which was very good, much better than my first drink.  Then our complimentary taco chips with salsa came out. This is part of the Stripes rewards. At this point we placed our food order, my wife ordered a cheese burger and I used my coupon for the Bourbon Grill Mahi Mahi which came with garlic spinach with mushrooms and cheddar mashed potatoes. Our meals came out in an acceptable amount of time, the food was hot and very good. You would think ordering Mahi Mahi at Friday's would be just ok but this dish was very good and tasty. Pretty good Friday's!  With all this, sending my drink back and have a coupon which gave us half off our bill, our waiter Ryan was on point, polite and efficient. I found this Friday's in Manhasset to usually be very good better than some others I have been to.

I thought that was awesome: get an app for $4, entree for $7 & dessert for $4. The portions are smaller but perfect for a quick bite on the go. The server was rude and walked away before I completed my order. He didn't ask or wait to hear what I wanted to drink.... So I had food with no drink. The food came out pretty quickly (15 mins). Too bad I couldn't eat it b/c my bag of food had no utensils or napkins. When I called the waiter back, he did the same as before and walked away before I got to finish asking him for utensils and hand wipes. When a manager came over and asked me if I was ready to pay, I was finally given good service. The loaded potato skins were delicious. The chicken tenders and fries were cooked perfectly.

We then responded, that we were a party of three, and she just then told us that we could not be seated for another 5 minutes even though there were empty tables galore. Again, I understand being understaffed and busy, but not seating customers is not the answer. A waiter then came over, ignored the hostess and sat us immediately. Our booth was DISGUSTING.

They wanted me to download the app, to redeem it through the app for them to even consider it.  Despite all of this mess the food was not even good. The appetizers were sent half cold because the bartender could not be attentive enough. I ordered the cajun chicken and shrimp and it had no taste. I literally ate a few bites.

I'm never thrilled about eating at a corporate chain like this but sometimes I get talked into things like this.  I was with a group and this was their choice, so here it goes.  Came with a party of 7 on a Sunday night. Waited 15 minutes to be seated while the host kept telling us our table was being cleaned. We were sat in the very back corner with 3 or 4 other large, empty tables. Hmmm. As soon as we sat down our server came to take our order. Huh? She decided to get our drinks but left off the lemons we ordered. When I order food I always try to ask for everything I'm going to need when I place my order, like extra ranch, so this way the server isn't running back and forth. Two of us asked several times for extra ranch before and during our meal (because we never received it the first request and someone different brought our food out also without the extra ranch).  I was feeling this was a bad choice but when the food came I was like, wow, this looks really good.  And it was. We started off with the Friday's Combo Appetizer which is boneless wings (but our server allowed us to get the bone in wings, add a point for her),  loaded potato skins and mozzarella sticks. I don't usually like mozzarella sticks but these were the best I've ever had. They were crispy and the cheese was perfectly melted and really good.  For our entrees I had the southern fried chicken sandwich with fries. This chicken was perfectly crisp and loaded with lettuce, tomato, pickles, avocado and cheese. YUM!! It was delicious. My son got the endless apps that were really good and fresh. I really liked that the server put in more than one app order at a time so he had something to eat instead of having to wait to order the next app. (Another point for the server). She also asked the rest of our group if they wanted to order any apps. (Two more points for the server). Two people in our group got the steak and ribs with mashed and vegi and they also enjoyed their food.  For my son and I my bill was $24. Excellent! Good food at good prices.  Plus.... There is a sign when we walked in that says they offer free apps at the bar every Friday 4-7pm. SCORE!
