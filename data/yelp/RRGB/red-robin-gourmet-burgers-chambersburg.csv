Paul N.,"Avon Lake, OH",0,91,8,5.0,9/24/2014,"My favorite burger chain restaurant. Changed it up with the Fish 'n Chips this time and was very satisfied. Lightly breaded, very little residual grease and four flavorful pieces. They even have malt vinegar for the fries. Cup of chili to start was meaty and not too spicy.

Telp R.,"Mercersburg, PA",0,3,,1.0,9/2/2015,"I can honestly say that EVERY time I have been here they have messed up our order. Today was no exception. I had called ahead to ""preorder"" our food as this was literally over a lunch ""hour"" and this would save time. I had the preprinted menu that is on their website in my hand. I called the phone number provided via Google. I was prompted with an automated woman telling me to ""Press 1 for carry out, press 2 to speak with the restaurant staff."" I pressed 2 and was told, ""I'm sorry, that option does not exist."" Um....okaaaay. So I pressed 1. I spoke with staff and made it very clear that we were dining in, just preordering to save time. I called at 11:30 for a 12:10 arrival time. We ordered an Apple Harvest chicken salad, a 1/2 soup and salad with French onion soup and spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. We arrived at 12:10. The dining room might have had 6 tables full. The host wound us around the entire restaurant to seat us at a table in the back. A DIRTY table. As I'm looking around at the 20 CLEAN tables around us, I'm like, seriously?? He says, ""Is this okay?"" As I look at him, again like, seriously? He says, ""Well, I'll come back and wipe it off."" Yeah, clever boy. Then our waiter arrives. I tell him that we preordered our food. he says, ""You did?"" No, I'm lying.. He comes back with the spinach dip. No plates, no silverware, no napkins. Didn't take our drink order. There were 10 pieces of celery, about 50 chips and about 1/2 cup of dip. It was tasty, but for $8? Tad pricey. And had 2 huge chunks of artichoke in it. I can say that I have never had to cut my dip before.. Then our food arrives. The soup was stone cold and one salad was completely incorrect. I looked at the salad and said, ""This doesn't look like the Apple Harvest chicken salad."" To which the waiter brightly states, ""What doesn't?"" Um...the Mars rover... or, perhaps, THE SALAD IN FRONT OF ME. He trots off and a female manager appears. She tells us that they don't even make that salad anymore and ""It was his mistake"", referring to the person who took my order. She asked me if she ""could make me something else real quick"", which I appreciated, but the entire reason for preordering was that we were on a time frame. I didn't have 15 minutes for her to make me a new meal. We were about 3 minutes into eating the food we were presented when the waiter appears again, now he has our bill in I his hand. He says they took off 10%. 10%?? How about COMPING my WRONG FOOD ORDER??? And since he brought us the bill, I guess we weren't invited to have coffee or dessert. We will NOT be back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg?start=20
Marsh W.,"Shippensburg, PA",71,34,14,3.0,11/20/2011,"What can I say? Red Robin makes good food. It's a national chain, so it is probably gonna be good. Where it will have variables is in staffing. In the last few times I've been there and especially this last time, I went to do the take out and had to stand there w/ my thumb up my butt until someone noticed me. I mean like ""kids walkin' by a pile of crap in the living room without seeing it"" wait. BTW, some of the ""walker's by"" were manager geeks. Still, when I was helped, the nice young lady ""Ashley"" I think it was, took my order and was very nice. She kept them from getting a bad review.  Anyway, good food. Can't really tell you about the service, it was spotty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg?start=20

Marion O.,"Kennesaw, GA",2,22,18,4.0,1/6/2010,"A family establishment with a specialty of burgers, veggie patties, and bison burgers. We were on a family trip and coming back home when we needed some gas. It was fairly close to the highway, but looked like it was in the middle of nowhere with other shopping places and food places. By far, Red Robin had to be the best place to go. I had the blue cheese Bison burger and it was delicious. The burger was well made and not over done or underdone. The toppings did not overpower the taste of the actual burger, which was a major plus for me. Service was quick and our waiter checked on us frequently. Red Robin is a great place to take a large group, family, or just a place to get a good burger. I don't think you can go wrong when you order from the menu. My mom had a California burger (burger with avocado) and dad had the BBQ burger. Both looked and tasted great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg?start=20

Diana P.,"Reisterstown, MD",21,154,14,4.0,12/6/2007,"New establishment in a new shopping complex off of Route 81 in Chambersburg, PA. Red Robins are known for their burgers.  I've sworn off beef, but I heard that you could get a veggie or bocca burger in any of the Red Robin flavors. Plus they have chicken and fish sandwiches too.  And bottomless fries. I'm happy to say that it was crowded, always a good sign, and that the wait staff and hostesses were efficient.  I got a Mexican style burger (can't recall the name), with a bocca burger replacement.  My husband got the same burger with beef.  Both were excellent.  The bocca is so realistic that at first I thought I had the beef--this is a little unnerving when you don't want to eat beef!  The fries were good. We actually got seconds.  Excellent sweet tea too.

Ryan S.,"Cashtown-McKnightstown, PA",0,14,,1.0,12/24/2017,"Well, I returned back for my second (and LAST) time at the Chambersburg Red Robin. My first time was about a year ago.... my party had a bad experience and reported it to corporate, who in turn had the store manager, Betsy, call me to apologize and offer complimentary gift cards in order for us to give them a second chance (she forgot to send the cards BTW for about a month!)  At any rate, we decided to give The Red Robin managed by Betsey another chance..... and I regret it thoroughly. Please bear in mind, I'm not the hardest person to please, and writing negative reviews is not something I do unless something extraordinary bad. Considering how empty the restaurant was, there should have been no excuse for our poor service and sub-par food. We were rushed to order by our waitress (can't remember her name.... dark hair, had a tattoo on the inside of her upper right arm, had a worn ""X"" sharpied on her hand indicating she must have been out the night before partying).... we went ahead and ordered their appetizer of chips, guacamole, and salsa... what arrived what shockingly sparse.... I have seen airlines offer larger portions. One small (as in carry out dipping sauce container sized.... about two three tablespoons) container of guacamole, another tiny container of salsa with a tiny bowl that maybe had about twelve tortillas in it. All that for $5. That was just laughable. Onto the second course: we ordered burgers with fries, and were offered a number of their dipping sauces which we were told were free of charge. Many of the flavors seemed interesting and we each asked for three different varieties. Our burgers came and they were rather small for what you would have expected for a $15 hamburger (smaller than I remembered in the past).... they were rather flavorless, the buns seemed not very fresh, and overall it was just ""messy"". Nothing we received looked as advertised. We also received only one of the different sauces we asked for (and those were wrong) I asked for steak sauce and napkins (we only had one on the table since we were seated) the waitress returned after a lengthy delay with three napkins and an empty bottle of steak sauce. WTF. I waited patiently for her to return (which she did not for over twenty minutes) allowing my wife to enjoy her meal while I waited..... as my burger was nearly fully cold, I decided to just eat it. Finally after about 25 minutes since she dropped off the food she returned... asking for more fries (we each received about TEN each initially), she kept asking if we just wanted to split one order.... finally she got it straight and returned with our fries.... my order had a whopping NINE fries on the plate. It was like pulling teeth to get her to come back... Our bill was almost $49.... for a iced tea, two hamburgers, and a $5 miniature airline portion of chips and guacamole/salsa. We were charged for about 6 of the ""FREE"" dipping sauces (at 75 cents each) even though we only received 4 of them after having had asked about four times! How can they charge $50 for dinner for two at a hamburger joint with crappy food and service? Thoroughly disgusting. What a fall from grace! Incredibly overpriced for (mostly) frozen ingredients that cost pennies on the dollar they charge! Even with the complimentary $30 gift card we had from our previous bad visit.... this wasn't nearly worth the remaining $18 we had to pay (plus tip.... she wasn't the most attentive waitress, but she meant well).  Strike Two. I don't need to give it a third shot.  Sayonara, Red Robin! Don't be so stingy! Update: after all this time, no upper management from Red Robin has attempted to right this wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg
Bruce K.,"Charlotte, NC",1416,8492,16632,4.0,11/1/2016,"It's very easy to go overboard at Red Robin and as I'm thinking Thanksgiving, I'm trying to make healthy choices. Sure, they have salads here and you can get fruit instead of fries. But... burgers. So I compromised and went with the simple chicken burger, which was a grilled chicken breast with LTO and pickles. Yes, I had the steak fries and while they're refillable upon request, I opted not to. The chicken was great. Not dry and rather tasty with the toppings. The fries were excellent and I added some of the Red Robin special salt to them. Yum. I don't feel guilty at all. Service was good. No waiting for the check - they have one of the table kiosk things where you can pay when you're ready. Easy! Lots of sports channels. I was a little bummed that one was showing a hunting television show. I don't need that while I'm eating, but I managed to get the lamp in my line of sight and it was done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg

Paul L.,"Lancaster, PA",2,41,15,2.0,8/12/2016,"The food was good and the service was good. However I felt the menu was misleading in its pictures of the food. I felt like it over promised and under delivered. Why the 2 stars.....it is a poor value. We had 4 burgers and a kids chicken strips meal. We had 2 lemonades and 2 soda's. The bill with tip.....$101.00. To be fair that included a $5 donation that they came to our table to solicit for a cancer fund drive.  Oh and a $1.99 charge for the kids to use on table thing.

Riky R.,"Mont Alto, PA",58,6,2,3.0,8/26/2016,It's your typical Red Robin so not much to say. The menu is the standard that you'll find in any city or town. Now I will compliment their staff.

J S.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",0,8,,1.0,6/10/2016,"Food and service was good... However the attitude of the manager on duty was disheartening. Generally speaking, I'm not the pickiest eater on the planet, however Iam conscious about what, and where, the food I eat comes from. I asked our waitress about the origin of the cod they had on the menu (bear in mind on the menu it is listed as ""Arctic Cod""), to which point the manager came out with the box to show us. Listed on the side was ""imported from China"". This is an immediate red flag for me due to the lack of food safety and contaminants known in the Chinese farm raised fish industry.... I'm sorry but chowing down on fish that is fed human excrement and has high levels of other contaminants is not my idea of a good meal. Not to mention, the false advertising aspects.

Trish M.,"Chambersburg, PA",33,3,,1.0,4/16/2016,We went for my son's birthday. I brought 12 people and it's the first bad experience I've ever had at Red Robin. We had 2 broken soda glasses on 2 separate occasions. The soda carbonation was way off and not drinkable. The top shelf margaritas tasted like they hardly any alcohol in them. My sons order wasn't put in and so he got his food about 10 minutes after everyone else's and no compensation for any of this. The nachos were good. I called the manager and she returned my call and offered a $10 gift card. That's not really comparable to what I spent and what we experienced but at least she tried.

Willow L.,"Fayetteville, PA",0,146,129,5.0,2/7/2015,"The Red Robin in Chambersburg always delivers a wonderful burger.  Service is sometimes a bit slow, but I don't mind as long as I have a cold beer. Speaking of beer, their beer prices are outrageous, but what can you do? I've tried several burgers and they're all good.  The meat is always tender, no full of gristle, and cooked to perfection.  Well done but never dry.  If you get a burger with bacon, the bacon is pretty darn good.  Not too fatty, not too thick and not paper-thin.  Burgers with the onion straws are a bit greasy, but taste amazing.   You'll likely have to wait if you go on a Saturday evening.  We try to go around 4:30-5:00 to avoid a long wait. The Ziosk allows you to pay at the table without the need of the server.  You can use your credit card or a gift card right there.  Some people may not find this to be very secure, but I think you can request the server swipe your card, or just bring cash.
