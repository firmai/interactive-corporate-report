36,Peggah G.,"Chicago, IL",261,439,84.0,2.0,2012-05-11,"I'm apart of the TGI Fridays rewards card thing, and I always think okay, let's go here, but every time it seems like a mistake. A horrible mistake. Once, my boyfriend and I went and we had an eccentric waiter. I know that in the past, their waitstaff was expected to be quirky, but recently I feel they've been going for a more toned down approach.  When the waiter came to our table, he said ""Hey guys"", and then went on to apologize about saying 'guys' when I, a lady, was at the table. I assured him that I didn't care, nor did I find it offensive.  When we placed our orders and they came up, the waiter handed my boyfriend his meal and said ""Here you go boss"".  !! That offended me, more than the 'guys'. How did this waiter think it was offensive to say guys, but then calling the man of the table 'boss' isn't offensive? Because of that experience it took a while to go back there. Then we went recently. Last week sometime. The line at McDonald's was too long, so we ended up going to TGI Fridays. They had a deal going on, where you eat an entree, an appetizer and dessert for $13 or $16, something like that. So we decided we wanted two entrees, two appetizers and one dessert. That should have been around $23, then with drinks, $30. Somehow it was not this, but we were so annoyed regardless that we just ended up paying it. We were sat at our table, and we waited almost 10 minutes before anyone came to us. We asked the maitre' d to get our waiter, and the manager ended up coming to our table to get our drink orders before our waitress. My boyfriend had wanted to leave after 5 minutes, but I really hate sitting down and then getting up to leave. It's so obnoxious. The boyfriend ordered pulled pork sandwich, which we told the waitress 3 times, and she confirmed it to us, yet somehow he got the wrong sandwich, but by that time we were both so hungry that we just ate it anyway.  Mind you, I like their food. I like the crispy green beans, the fried mozzarella, I love the parmesan crusted chicken with the tortellini. Their desserts are also really really good. It's just the poor wait staff, the loud obnoxious music that lately has made me rather eat at McDonald's or go to Meijer to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=20,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

I haven't been to Friday's in years but we decided to give it a whirl. We got there about 7:30 and were seated immediately. I t wasn't really busy as the restaurant was about half full. We got seated in the bar area and it was nice and not overly loud at all. I ordered the Bleu & Bacon Sirloin steak medium-rare with parmesan potatoes and mozz-tomato salad. Also, the table ordered the pot stickers as an app. The pot stickers were very good. Service was excellent as our waiter was very attentive, refilling soda quickly and without us having to ask (a BIG plus in my book). My steak came out cooked perfectly and was very good. No complaints from anyone else at the table as J. Daniel shrimp & chicken and chicken alfredo were the other dishes selected. All-in-all a very good experience!!

The entrees here are great, my go to is the bruschetta chicken pasta, but the ribs and steaks are good, Cajun chicken pasta is good, jack Daniels burger is good, and the fries here are great.

I go here more then a few times a week due to my friends that work at the best buy right down the road from it. You have to love a food place you can go into a couple times and by like the 2nd or 3rd time people remember your name and give you a big smile when you go in. My only small complaint is that if you order things medium they are going to be more to the well done side =-) but no reason at all to take a star away from the great service and the food that still taste great.

40,Alice L.,"Ypsilanti, MI",3,12,15.0,1.0,2013-10-25,"First of all, this place is NOT on Waters Road. It is on Lohrs Road. Also, there should be an update on the street view photo since it's just a picture of the woods on Waters Road.  I don't usually feel the need to write reviews at all, so, this will be my first review. I came here for my birthday dinner tonight in a party of three. I'm actually a big fan of TGI Friday's, but this place is nothing like the ones I've experienced before.   We ordered the Jack Daniel's Sampler which I've had many times before in previous TGI Friday's. We waited about 20 minutes and when it came, it looked nothing like the picture. The plate was dirty, the short ribs seemed microwaved and it was stone cold in the center. The crispy cajun shrimp was undercooked and barely crispy. The chicken was cooked, but it seemed like someone had taken a bite out of one and tried to cover it up with the sauce. I don't understand why our appetizer even took that long since it wasn't even properly cooked.  For the meals two of us (including me) ordered The Jack Daniel's Black Angus Stirlon Steak & Shrimp dish while the other one had something else that I cannot seem to remember at the moment. When our meals finally came, my meal was missing the crispy cajun shrimp and my husband was given their seasoned fries instead of sweet potato fries. When I finally received the crispy cajun shrimp, it was cold and not crispy. I'm pretty sure they microwaved it like they did with the short ribs. My seasoned fries tasted old and stale. My black Angus steak was unevenly cooked. I asked for medium and it came medium rare, medium and medium well done. How hard is it to cook a damn steak evenly? Apparently, it must have been that difficult for them cooks in the back to cook almost everything properly. My mashed potatoes was pretty much the highlight of my meal;but, shouldn't EVERYTHING have been a highlight though?? In the end, I was charged extra for drinks that were suppose to be at a discount this night. If you try and complain, they will blame you. Once they get your money, the servers disappear as well. Ridiculous? YES. It seemed odd since the place wasn't busy at all and I saw the servers literally playing and messing around the entire time we were there.  So, don't waste your money and time coming here! The servers do not care about you! Next time, I'm definitely going to take the extra drive on back to the metro Detroit area to go to TGI's with no bitter disappointments!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=20,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000004
34,Hillary A.,"Laingsburg, MI",0,11,1.0,1.0,2014-07-21,"This is for the Lohr Rd location. We came here when we moved to town because we hadn't had time to get groceries and hadn't even unpacked the kitchen yet. Just needed something quick and easy and this place is just a mile away from us. My boyfriend went to pick up our order and they had said he could have a seat at the bar to wait for it. He sat there for about 10 minutes and then realized there was some food sitting on the counter asked if it was his order and they said yes. It wasn't even warm by the time he had gotten home because they had left it sitting on the counter without telling him the order was ready.  We decided to give it a second try when our power went out. Got seated back by the kitchen which is no big deal. But had to wait at least 10 minutes before we even got a water to drink. It was a steady flow of servers walking by and I even saw the manager walk by a few times. Finally our servers came, yes plural because she was training someone. They were of course out of the one thing we both wanted...nachos. How do you run out of nachos? If you run out of something so easy to make go across the street to Meijer and get back up. We picked different items and ordered. Spinach dip came out warm. Not hot. And the rest of our food was less than mediocre. We both ended up just getting appetizers because none of the meals even sounded good. I know now that it wasn't just a bad time the first visit...it will always be like that. No one seemed happy to be working there either and you couldn't get connected to their wifi.

28,C T.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",1,28,,1.0,2014-11-07,"Never going back... We went on a Friday night for dinner.  The wait for a table was about 20 minutes, despite plenty of visible open tables.  We then waited another 35 minutes for water.  I ordered one of their new specialty mixed drinks, and it was filled with ice and no flavor, and was presented in a sticky glass. We ordered appetizers that took 45 minutes.  My meal came after an hour and a half, but they didn't have my husband's cooked yet.  Our waiter kept apologizing that his burger wasn't ready yet, but he didn't order a burger.  This happened at least 3 times.  I ate in front of him for 20 minutes before his food came out.  We agreed the food was average at best.  During dinner I ordered another mixed drink and it was flat and likely missing any alcohol. Our waiter said he would get the manager for us 2 times, but never did.  The waiter comp'ed half our meal.  The only reason we were ok with that was because we had a gift card, and we could use up all the money on it.  We didn't want to come back again to use the rest of the money.

24,Beth L.,"Ann Arbor, MI",77,15,,2.0,2015-07-22,"Okay, so I try to avoid chain restaurants, but since I was with my teenage son who prefers to *not* put much thought into dining, I will occasionally go to places like a TGI Fridays when I'm with him.  So, the service was strangely off. Our server seemed nice, when we saw her that is. There were times she'd walk toward our table, and then turn around and waddle elsewhere. She almost seemed to avoid us? Very strange to me.  No silverware on the table, and it took 15 minutes to get that. Generally a place like TGI Fridays refills drinks before one asks, but this never happened. Fine, I'd rather not have my son drink much soda, but not a single refill was offered.  Our food took way too long to arrive at the table. Seemed like over 20 minutes? My chicken breast was like rubber in spots -- definitely over-cooked.  Flavor was pretty good though, considering. Oh, the mac & cheese is actually really good. Fattening, but good for a little comfort food treat.  Not a spot for a day when you're trying to keep your calories at or below 1200 for the day, so keep that in mind if you wish.  This experience was the worst I've had at this restaurant (at this location). I don't know if I'll go back. Not the worst experience I've ever had in my life, but it was below average for sure.

I my food came out with hers so while waiting for her food to be recooked mine got cold. It was just soup so you'd think they'd ask if I would like to have mine put back until hers was ready.  The manager then came over and apologized for the raw chicken and walked away. Didn't seem very concerned. More just obligated to come over. Chicken then came out. It was delicious.  Bill came out- they changed us for everything! They couldn't even be bothered to comp us on a drink or a dessert or heaven forbid the chicken dinner that almost killed my friend!

14,Michael T.,"Saline, MI",8,90,40.0,2.0,2016-04-21,"This business is on its way out for good reasons: 1) Management, including the General Manager, has lost customer focus.    He rejected a corporate coupon specifying this particular location without looking at it.   I had to call him over and showed him the coupon, which he studied for a good couple of minutes and then said; ""yep, it's good."" I asked him why he rejected in the first place and he said he thought it was a different coupon (That's is why you read the coupon before rejecting or accepting).  No apology for delaying my order 15 minutes.  The place was dead at 7 pm on a Saturday and I knew why right at that moment. 2) Food is expensive and poorly prepared.  In spite of asking for tender ribs, we received ribs that were dry and lacking tenderness.  We had dry ribs here in the past, which is why we asked.  The ribs had little Jack Daniels sauce and a small 1/4 filled couple of Jd sauce on the side for some shrimp. When I asked for more sauce because the cup was almost empty right when brought out, the waiter said there is an up charge.   I told just told him to fill the little cup you gave me, which he did.   The ribs were a $26 item and they are going to up charge for an ounce of sauce for these dry ribs!  Geez! I should have sent these back but we were on track for a movie. 3) This place doesn't feel fun.  The lack of smiles, greetings, goodbyes and the general body language in this place just feels wrong for a food service business that is supposed to be a fun place.  Probably not the workers fault, but maybe management creating a ""bummer"" work environment.   Maybe everybody was feeling low because the place was dead?

18,Steve K.,"Ypsilanti, MI",5,23,1.0,2.0,2016-10-08,"We haven't been here in a while and have had okay dining experiences before, but the food was just horrible--bland and tasteless. Our kids hardly touched their pasta. Apparently their marinara for kids pasta is the same marinara as mozzarella sticks. It was gross. Bruschetta chicken pasta no longer is made with angel hair, now uses fetuccine which is used in a different pasta too--I'm noticing a cost-cutting theme. We all left hungry. Oh and it was empty for a Saturday lunch, not a good sign--and the food still took a loooong time. The only redeeming quality is that the staff was friendly and the manager discounted our bill significantly which is why this isn't a one-star review. Such a shame, used to like this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
20,Kyla P.,"Detroit, MI",0,14,,1.0,2016-11-09,"My family and I came here on a SATURDAY night (around 9pm) and had to wait 30 minutes for a table, which would have been fine if there were anyone in the restaurant. The place was practically empty so I'm not sure what the wait was about. After sitting down we waited about 20 minutes to order and waited another 10-15 for drinks. We had a big party (about 10 people) but drinks shouldn't take that long. Once we all had ordered our food the waiter came back and told us they did not have jack daniel's chicken anymore (they are known for their jack daniels items, how did you run out)? The kids' food came out last and cold and many items were forgotten. After asking for boxes and the bill we waited literally another 15 minutes for our server to bring anything. This time they were out of boxes and only had the really tiny ones. I probably will never be back to this TGI Fridays, EVER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

We had a really nice meal there last night and the server and this special bring us back.  Oh, I get the ribs ""naked"" and the rub they use is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

When we arrived a little less than half the tables were filled and it took 10-15 minutes before our presence was acknowledged and we were offered beverages - we were actually about to leave. Then, I was told about 20 minutes after we ordered our food that the kitchen was out of the item I had ordered - shouldn't they have known that right away? And then they brought my husband the wrong order. The food was good, but they are clearly very understaffed and it took way to long to eat there.

If you want something to wash it down with good luck can't get refills. Would stay away from this location. Young manager doesn't know how to run this location according to bar and off employees in the corner. Which is really sad because he was the only one who was doing anything. Company needs to help this manager turn this place around soon or it will be just like the restaurant across the street ÇLOSED.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
