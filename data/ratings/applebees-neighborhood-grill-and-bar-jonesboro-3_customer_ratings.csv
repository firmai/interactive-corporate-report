I am a frequent at the Applebees establishments in Tampa Bay, FL, and this particular restaurant does not live up to standards. This place is in much need of some staff improvements. They walk around talking amongst themselves, playing around and grouping up in corners when there were customers waiting to be, well, waited on. The only reason I am giving any stars on the rating is because of how fast our food came out.

25,Kenya D.,"Fulton, GA",0,4,,1.0,2012-05-27,"I purchased a to-go order from Applebee's at 6608 Tara Blvd., Jonesboro, GA 30236 on 3/25/12 @ 4:49pm.  When I opened the box to eat, I saw something that was totally inedible. This slop should have never left the Applebee's kitchen.   I took the food back to the restaurant manager and asked for a refund ($21.40).  I was told repeatedly that it was their company's policy not to issue a refund.  The manager told me that I could select something else from the menu or receive a gift card for the amount of the purchase.  I told her that those options were not acceptable.    I called Applebee's corporate office and they were no help.  I finally got in touch with Channel 5 (Fox 5 News)-Call for Action Team. They got in touch with Applebee's VP of Operations.  He contacted me and mailed me my refund of $21.40 the next day. I commend the local news' consumer advocates who REALLY fight for consumer's rights.   Don't fall victim to a business who doesn't value you as a customer.  You can choose to spend your money ANYWHERE!  But a business should be grateful when you select them.   If after turning over your hard earned money, you're not satisfied with the product or service, try to resolve the matter directly with the merchant.  If a resolution can't be reached, then I definitely recommend contacting your local news' consumer advocate team for help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-3?start=20,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004

24,Desmond M.,"Atlanta, GA",6,63,7.0,2.0,2013-06-07,"I previously reviewed this restaurant 4 months ago and gave it high praises. Apparently on my return there must be new staff and management because this experience I recently had was nothing to jump about. Ordered spinach dip and the dip was cold when it got to our table and the chips that go with it were stale. I requested fresh chips and warmer dip and the next batch of chips he brought tasted like they were dumped in a basket of salt. I decided I'll work with that because the dip did take off the salty edge. So I ordered a seasonal blue moon beer, which I'm glad I did cause you would have to be a little tipsy to enjoy this evenings service. To keep it simple and to save time I ordered a caeser salad half. I didn't receive my order for another 40 minutes after the ten minutes after the initial arrival of the spinach dip. My waiter was no where to be found and the restaurant was not packed at all! One person at the bar and a few couples and a handful of families. Not enough to daily a salad almost an hour. When it did arrive it tasted good. I couldn't see how you mess up a caeser salad. Once I received my check while I was waiting to cash out I noticed how filthy everything was around me. My seat was dirty. My table had crumbs from whoever was there before. There was used utensils under the table, that I did noticed until my foot kept stepping on them and I didn't want to look anymore into cause there was no telling what else was down there. Paid and left in a hurry.  It will be awhile before I return.

I could be much more understanding if the place was packed, but it was not busy at all. After waiting for about 45 mins my food finally came. I'm starving and tired, as I look down on my plate I come across a piece of hair in my food! That's not even the worst part.... I totally understand that it was not my waiters fault that my food had hair in it, so I didn't get mad at him. BUT he made the situation worst by avoiding my table... We waited about 20 mins before he even came back to ask him for a Togo box then another 15 mins for him to actually bring the box and additional 15 for him to come back for the check and another 7 mins to bring us back our card.... Like seriously it was NOT busy. I used to be a waiter so I know what the deal is.  Oh AND when I told another waiter about the hair, she said she would get the manager! But the manager never came! I watched run to her tell her manager and they just completely blew me off like it wasn't a big deal! How do you expect to get business with management like that.

Which is fine if that is the truth but I honestly feel like that should have been said earlier in the convo and also in a nicer way ..so I decided not to order because that was very rude of the female whoever was on the clock to answer the phone between 11:40pm - 12:00am (dec 27,2014) .

15,Dr. D.,"Jonesboro, GA",2,11,2.0,3.0,2015-12-12,"This review almost was a one star!!! Stopped by on my way home to grab dessert; blonde with vanilla icecream. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by no one. When I approached the bar to sit down, a bartender says I wouldn't sit there because our wait staff frequents there. So I move to the other side of the bar stating I just want to order dessert. She states, okay just go to the other side in a dismissive tone... never a hi or welcome or how may I help you. Once on the other side of the bar, I take a seat. The bartender carries on as if I'm not even there. The manager eventually comes out and ask if I was being assisted, I said no, that I just needed to place a to go order. He instructs the bartender to take my order, again she was dismissive and never acknowledged me. After a few minutes I get up and leave. Get to the parking lot, get in my car and then I see the manager approaching.  He asked me to come back in, I replied no that's okay,  I'll go to another Applebees. He kindly insists and states that's not how we do things. I go back in...to apologize  for the unprofessional and dismissive service I initially received he provides a drink and dessert on the house. Now, I've been to many Applebees,  but can honestly say this was the first time where I encountered a manager that cared about the consumer experience.  I went from being extremely offended to a valued customer all in 30 minutes. The manager, who stated he's been with the company for 27 years made the difference. .. THANK YOU! Now as a customer service consultant and business professor I strongly recommend the two female bartenders be replaced.  In the service business, ""customer service"" is paramount. Unfortunately,  the two female bartenders working tonight lack the professionalism and customer engagement for long term sustainability.  Again, huge thanks to the manager for his professionalism and customer empathy.  Kind regards,  Dr. Sykes",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-3,,,,,

We came in after a busy work week on Friday 1.8.16! I was struggling looking through the menu because I'm not a frequent applebees customer. I would have loved if the waitress would have gave some type of recommendation! She didn't, not even when I asked what did she suggest for a good cocktail...She was very sweet though! She's from Texas, and has the most adorable accent I've heard! It took forever for our drinks to come out, My friend's got their food before mine which was strange because usually they bring all the food out together...apparently my food was sent to the wrong table!

Walked in the front door as a party of 4 and the disaster started. I see at least 6 empty booths and 2-4 empty tables. The hostess immediately says there's going to b a wait? Why? We're short staffed. Short staffed? On a race weekend? Seriously. Ok, we'll wait. How long is the wait? Answer: until we get a table ready. Uhhh, can you tell me in minutes? Answer: No. Ok, we'll wait. During our ""wait"" I watch the hostess bus a table and that's when I notice a little closer exactly how filthy this place was. Trash all over the floor, multiple tables in need of cleaning. Then I see the ""hostess"" wipe down a table and seats with a rag from the hostess station and place that same rag right back under the hostess station. No water, no cleaner, just a filthy rag at room temp used over and over. Next issue, during our wait, three more parties of four enter, the hostess then takes the last party to arrive to the table she ""cleaned"" just leaving us standing there with no explanation. Next walks in an additional party of three. They just give up on waiting for the hostess to return so they sit in one of the booths that has been empty since we arrived. A waitress brings them menus, takes their orders, brings their drinks and the rest of us are still waiting on the hostess. I watch as 8 people simultaneously walk out the front door.

Even after we were seated, it took about 15-20 minutes for our waitress to come and take our orders.   We came in during their October $1 margarita special, dollarita. It was really watered down, and I felt like I was drinking lemonade and not a margarita. You do get what you pay for.  After 10pm they have 1/2 off appetizers. We ordered the spinach dip. We were given a side of salsa with it as well. The spinach dip was good for the price. I wanted to order the chicken wonton tacos but I was told that they were out of wontons. I've had it before and it's probably one of my favorite appetizers from them. The flavors blend well together and it's a pretty light appetizer. Despite the service I love Applebee's and their food. The price is good and the drinks are good. I enjoy coming here to watch games or just chill with friends. I will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-jonesboro-3,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
