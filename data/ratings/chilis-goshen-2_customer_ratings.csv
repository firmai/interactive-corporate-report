16,Ally B.,"Elkhart, IN",0,11,,2.0,2012-02-23,"We were going to go to Steak and Shake today, and we should have. This was my boyfriend's and my first time at this chili's. And might I add, we are fans of this chain. We sat down rather quickly, since it was a Thursday. We waited about 5 minutes before someone came to our table. The waitress only asked if someone had gotten our drink order. We said they hadn't, so she did. The waitress never introduced herself, or asked us how we were. We decided to do the 2 for $20 deal. As we waited for our half order of cheese fries, our drinks were left empty. Once we received our appetizer, we were disappointed. This dish is normally flavorful and...not so dry. This appetizer has fries on a skillet, topped with ranch dressing, melted shredded cheese, bacon bits, and jalapenos. In our case, it had all of that, except the ranch dressing. It wasn't very hot and didn't have flavor. The fries tasted like they had been sitting in the back for hours. Our waitress, whose name is Danica, came and cleared our plates, and about 20 minutes later  our entrees came, then we were finally asked if we wanted refills. We ordered the bacon burger and margarita chicken. Both entrees were delicious. Juicy and we;; prepared. The waitress however left a sour taste in our mouths. As I finished my plate, my boyfriend is still finishing his, Danica brings us the bill and walks away. She didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert. We wait for 10 minutes for her to come back and  she asks if we wanted a refill. Well why would we want a refill if you gave us our bill to shove us out? She had as much personality as a lint trap, never asked how things were, came by only to drop things off. When I asked for the receipt, she gave me the short copy, which means I can't take the chili's online survey.  Like I said, we should have gone to Steak and Shake, had better service and spent less money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
15,Reuben H.,"Bremen, IN",42,20,26.0,1.0,2013-06-13,This review is only based on service and not food because instill haven't had any. Ordered drinks and appetizers and after 20 minutes finally was asked to order the main food. Really slow service on a really slow night. Only eat here if you have all the time in the world.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
14,Skyler W.,"Elkhart, IN",10,9,,1.0,2014-03-02,"The booth space is insanely small. Seriously small... You really can't fit 4 people in them. I know they're trying to fit as many people in the restaurant but it's ridiculous. But it's okay, I won't be back because of it. Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
11,Marjorie M.,"Goshen, IN",1,2,,1.0,2014-10-29,"It was my step-daughter's birthday and we wanted to take her family out for a celebratory dinner. Her family includes her husband and her two young sons ages 12 and 9. We were seated very shortly after 6 pm. We were greeted by a very nice waitress who took our beverage orders promptly. I do not remember her name, but she was the bright spot in this otherwise dismal dining experience. The boys, with the help of their mother, ordered the '2 for $20 deal....chicken fajitas and barbecue ribs with the cheese fries as their appetizer. After ordering, they waited a good 15 minutes for their appetizer to appear. The clock was ticking closer and closer to their bedtime on this school night. After another 25 minutes our entrees appeared. Cold French fries with the ribs and grizzley sirloin steak...gross. The whole meal took TWO HOURS! A meal at Chilis is not one that should take that long. The restaurant seems dirty...sticky tables, slippery floors, broken down bathroom. It's a shame that our town has so few choices for dining that this is where we ended up. It will be a long time til I go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
13,Margaret B.,"Nappanee, IN",0,16,,5.0,2014-12-15,"My favorite restaurant in Goshen! We always get good waitresses and if they make mistakes, they make up for it. We never have to ask for refills or have to wait for our food too long. Great place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
10,Cameron H.,"Elkhart, IN",9,113,96.0,5.0,2015-04-30,"This place is a great place for everyone! Love their bacon burgers and the strawberry lemonade! When we first stepped in the door. The smell of the grill (almost) instantly hits you! The waiter put us at a table. I forgot they had the Zoisks (The Pay And Go Deal) which was cool and good. You could play games on this (Pay $1.99 Extra for unlimited game play). Ordered bacon burger and let me tell you. It was good! ""Could I have more. I'm starving!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
17,Tom S.,"Elkhart, IN",8,2,,1.0,2015-09-25,"The service here is really a serious deterent and after quite a few visits, in an attempt to determine if the bad service is just a fluke,  I have finally decided enough is enough and do not plan to return. The food, when prepared properly, is good and the environment is pleasing, but the service really stinks and ruins what is positive about the restuarant. I have gone on both busy weekend nights and slow mid-week evenings and find the only difference is that the service is a little worse on the slower nights. The wait staff is generally slow to take your order and the kitchen is even slower. Their computer system must have some limitations because I have frequently gotten food that wasn't prepared in accordance with what I ordered. My son recently ordered a ribeye steak medium that was way over cooked.  I order my burgers well done and have had them come out pink and swimming in red liquid that I literally have had to mop up with my napkin. The corn on the cob is also overcooked most of the time and comes out all shrivelled up. Make sure you tell your wait person every possible detail at the time you order.  If you change your mind or forgot to mention something you are just out of luck because you typically will not see them again until your food is brought to the table. I don't know where they all go to hide, but they disappear, only to show up for the most basic elements: take your order and bring you your food. Drink refills rarely happen. If somehting is wrong with your order you better speak up fast,, and I mean very fast, because they run off as soon as the last delivered plate hits the table.  You can't flag them down because they usually look down after helping other customers and do not make eye contact with anyone en route to their hideout. When our meal is finished I more often than not leave either disappointed or angry, and who wants to pay for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
5,Mckenzie Y.,"Dundee, MI",33,21,5.0,1.0,2015-12-09,"I've worked in many restaurants, I know what it takes to keep a dining room clean. And this framed mirror is not even close to clean. I ran my finger through the middle of it so you can see how thick this dust is. Just plain gross! No one wants to eat beside this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
12,Chelsea F.,"Elkhart, IN",47,1,,1.0,2016-01-25,Worst service ever! Gave up on dining in due to lack of service so decided to try Chilis to go. Made an online order and received a pick up time... Got there 5 minutes after the stated pick up time and the employee was completely rude. I don't know if my order was lost or there was some sort of miscommunication but not only was it not ready it hadn't been started... They told me it would be ready in ten more minutes but didn't offer any type of explanation or apology. This was the last time I will try Chilis. Such. Bad. Service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
6,Danielle G.,"Granger, IN",24,165,134.0,1.0,2016-03-12,Service is S L O W ... Crazy slow with the only explanation being their kitchen is short staffed.  No comp for anything.  This reason was given after waiting 40 minutes after placing our unlimited soup/salad order.  Ugh... I used to LOVE meeting friends here and enjoyed great service when it was first opened 10 yrs ago. Management needs to step up..   This is a great location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
7,David S.,"Goshen, IN",22,8,,5.0,2016-04-07,Great food! Looks nice with the new renovations and we will be back many times! The waitresses are usually friendly and accurate,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
8,Dee B.,"Elkhart, IN",13,7,,1.0,2016-07-18,"This was my favorite place to eat. The wait staff is absolutely horrible. We always say let's give them another try, because we love the food that much. The waitresses are rude and spend most of the time in the kitchen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
9,Sarah P.,"New Paris, IN",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-06,"If I could give this location negative stars I would. I have never had more consistently negative experiences at a restaurant than I have here. We have almost never waited less than 10 minutes before being acknowledged by a server. On our latest visit, it took a full 10 minutes between being seated and when our server first approached our table, despite her attending a table directly across the aisle from ours three times during that ten minutes. When I made my dissatisfaction known she offered a very annoyed apology and chips and salsa on her. She took our order and brought drinks and the chips, 11 minutes later. Our food took an additional 33 minutes, but was prepared well, a rarity for this location. When we had finished eating and retrieved our check from the self service ziosk, I had been charged for the chips and salsa that were offered as a consolation for the less than stellar service at the beginning of the meal. The manager was less than gracious about removing them from my check. While I have said in the past that I would not return to this Chili's, this visit put the final nail in their coffin and I will absolutely never return. I would recommend that if you are looking for a casual meal in the Goshen area to go to Applebee's or Wings, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
4,Aaron G.,"Elkhart, IN",4,12,1.0,2.0,2017-03-04,"Saturday night, at least a dozen empty tables, still a 25 minute wait. No manager in sight. Incompetence, plain and simple.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
2,Kenny R.,"Elkhart, IN",20,16,29.0,1.0,2017-03-18,"Just left after not ordering food.  Not because we weren't hungry, but because after sitting there for 15 minutes and no server coming to our table we decided they did not like us.  Oh well their loss!! We were a group of awesome people!!!! They missed out not us.  Previous experiences here indicated to us that we were not going to have a great time anyways. So our expectations were not very high.  Most likely will never be back!!!! There are way too many other restaurants near this location. The only good thing that ever came out of this Chili's is I met my wife here years ago on our first date.  I would recommend to anyone reading this review to stay far far away from this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
3,Big B.,"Shipshewana, IN",1,32,2.0,2.0,2017-03-28,"Food is a little better than ""fast"" food most of the time. Silverware is filthy. Looks like somebody wiped boogers all over it. My fiance likes chili's for whatever reason, so I suffer through it occasionally. This particular location has gone downhill. It seems to get worse every time we visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
0,Kelly P.,"Indianapolis, IN",91,278,355.0,3.0,2017-11-30,"Atmosphere / decor - 3 Service - 3 Food - 3.5 Location - 3 Value - 3 Overall 3 Overall very average. I had a decent experience unlike a lot of the reviews below. I went with my parents on a Sunday morning for lunch. We were seated quickly. Service was slow, it did take a really long time to get our water but she did check on us a few times. I don't have the highest of expectations for chains like this.  The food was decent, my mom said she thought it was much improved from previous visits. I got a lighter fare option with chili chicken (can't remember the name). It came with broccoli which I thought was cooked perfectly and Mexican rice which was decent. The chicken itself was flavorful and satisfying. I didn't leave hungry or stuffed but perfectly content.  Overall I would come back here over Applebee's based on this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
1,Kelli M.,"Goshen, IN",119,6,11.0,5.0,2017-12-11,"okay, so we all know chili's isn't this insanely amazing restaurant, but I am giving it 5 starts because of this: every time my husband and I have gone we have had nothing but great service! everything we have ordered has been well prepared as well and has always tasted great. Another reason for this rating is because today I was craving their chips and salsa and fried pickles, so I ordered them online for pickup. I got in my car and received a call from them saying they didn't have enough pickles and they were so sorry and offered me ANYTHING I wanted with no extra charge; I just said the cheese curds would be great. I got there and went inside and it was all ready and the guy apologized again and said they fried all the pickles they had left and out those in along with everything else, he also gave me a $10 certificate for my next visit!! That's pretty amazing customer service if you ask me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-goshen-2,,,,,
