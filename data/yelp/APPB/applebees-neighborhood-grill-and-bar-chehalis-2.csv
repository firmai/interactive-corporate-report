Nate M.,"Puyallup, WA",0,3,1,5.0,11/21/2017,"After reading many of the negative reviews I was hesitant to stop here. Not sure what happened to make so many people dislike it so much, because my experience was great.  Stopped in about 9pm on a Tuesday. Place has several guests and several more while we were there. I had the Caesar salad to start and it was quite good. Foe an entree I had the bourbon street chicken and shrimp. Great flavor, juicy chicken, and served hot so I know it didn't sit around in back for a while. Also came with some red potatoes that were seasoned nicely.  Service was great as well. Erika served us and was right on time with an iced tea refill and when it was low again another server noticed and brought one without even asking.  All around a great experience and I will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2

She ignores the unfilled ice tea glass. No water is brought. No question of refills or water, on a scorching midafternoon. Falesha T. server us , we were billed at 3:37 pm. Also, waited over 7 minutes for our Mimosa to arrive. Unknown when the order was placed but the bartenders was seen gabbing across the bar with another server? in purple shirt.

Service was so-so, if not marginal.  In a half-full restaurant, my glass (and those of my friends) sat empty more than half an hour until I took them up to the bar for refills.  We were very well-behaved guests, not rude, demanding, or pushy.  But twice, we had to go up to the bar because our glasses had gone dry and remainder that way -- far too long.

Probably the best place to eat in Chehalis, although I do love Carl's Jr.'s crispy chicken sandwiches and Papa Pete's Pizza in Centrailia's Pepperoni Pizza. Desserts are great, love the churro smores. The burgers are amazing, I highly reccomend the Triple Bacon Burger. This establishment feels really nice to eat in and I love the atmosphere.

Jamieleigh W.,"Sandpoint, ID",166,469,742,3.0,4/22/2014,"The service is five stars for me, but the food... Not so much. I looked up the menu ahead of time and was really excited about this entree the creamy Parmesan chicken.  The cheese melted on top was tasty with the chicken but the sauce and rice mixture was awful! I couldn't stand the flavor. And the sauce is in between the chicken and the cheese. The spinach had no seasoning whatsoever - salt, pepper, anyone?  I was still hungry so I ordered dessert of the cheesecake apple chiri thing - that was delicious! Vanilla ice cream with caramel topping and a sugar and cinnamon coated tortilla lightly fried with cheesecake in the center.  Also their salads were good and generous portions. I'd try something else here - but prefer other places in town over this one - however, they were closed on Mondays so this was really the only option for us. And it was packed so some people must love it despite the reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2

John went above and beyond for our family. service was prompt, the food was incredible, and I got to try one of their Halloween specialty drinks, which was fruity and amazing. John continued to impress by singing to my daughter, drawing her a picture with her crayons, and even wrote her a note telling her she's lovely and to come back soon. he explained he is also a parent, and you can just tell by how he interacts with kids. he blew my mind and I just had to let everyone know about the best server in town!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2

Dennis S.,"Seattle, WA",8,154,1,3.0,9/1/2015,The biggest strength of Applebee's is that you can always get what you expect. My wife and I stop here most times on our way south from Seattle.

We both couldn't taste anything but syrup and flavoring in our drinks and one of them was a Long island iced tea, so we payed $7 for a lemonade and simple syrup.

By the time I got my fish & chips I ordered my husband was almost done with his meal. The manager tried offering salad or soup to make up for it but if I had wanted that to begin with I would have order it. They were nice enough to give a $8.00 discount but seriously they screwed up our order and then to top it off the fish & chips were not very good :/ we should have been given the meal for free- it's called good business - you screw up - you eat it.

Brianna L.,"Tacoma, WA",1,13,60,1.0,4/9/2013,"I was driving down from Tacoma, WA to Portland, OR and wanted to grab a burger, but not a gross McDonald's one. So I stopped at this Applebee's and got the Curbside (since I had my daughter asleep in her carseat). They didn't include napkins and when I actually looked at my cowboy burger, I was pretty disappointed. (pictured)  The crispy onion straws were more like unbreaded, microwaved onions, and the burger was waaaay overcooked. Even the fries were bad, limp and not crispy. It's like someone cancelled their already-made-order so they put it in the window for an hour or two and then gave to the next idiot who did curbside.  $10 down the drain for a gross burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2

We couldn't be seated at a booth even though several were empty... they were covered with more dirty dishes. Everyone in our party of four had complaints about their food. Oddly shaped ribs, soggy salad with rubbery chicken, and soggy fish with bland veggies. Not worth the 30 bucks I personally spent.

Joshua Y.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,1.0,9/8/2014,"I should start this review by stating I haven't always been a fan of Applebee's, but when a friend suggested we grab a quick bite to eat I couldn't say no. But how I wish I had said no.  The service here was not terrible and probably the best part of the whole experience. Our waitress was nice and helpful with anything we had questions about. Unfortunately, she was not around often and in place was the manager who was not very personable.  Now on to the worst part...the food. The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was cold and the chips were doused in grease which wasn't a good start. My main entree was the blackened tilapia which I thought would be easy enough to prepare and cook properly, but how I was wrong. The tilapia was flavorless and mushy, the vegetables were still raw in the middle, and the ""crispy"" red potatoes were not at all crispy. Overall, I was disappointed and it left a terrible taste in my mouth. As a side note, how can a Bud Light cost $4.75 at a happy hour anywhere? That to me was the cherry on the awful sundae.  This experience has finally made me say, ""I will never eat at an Applebee's again"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-chehalis-2?start=20
DeAnna C.,"Tacoma, WA",7,38,8,2.0,1/24/2015,So I am convinced it is an Applebee's thing they can not cook a steak to save their life's.  The lady working the door was older than the hills I stood by her a good five minutes not wanting to say anything  so that I would not give her a heart attack.  I was also not sure she would hear me.  We were seated quickly. I have to say that restaurants are not spaced properly for plus sized people. We ordered and I got the Parmesan shorn and sirloin cooked medium. My kids dad ordered the Thai Seafood Salad which looked decent sized in the menu.  When we got the salad it was microscopic four ounces the manager said. $12 for a tiny side salad seems a bit much.  My steak was well done. I ordered medium. I told the manager he replaced it. This one was cooked right but just like warm the potatoes were powdery and cold. The veggies were cold not impressed. The bacon burgers kids dad got looked sad but he said it was good.  We had to ask the people to bring his onion rings cause they were not on the plate.  I ordered a chocolate mousse shorter dessert and the Oreos in it were stale and mushy.  I am not impressed the manager was apologetic but he only comped our 2.49 dessert and never rechecked back.  The server was super nice and efficient he apologized and told us he was new. I hope this guy moves on from here before he comes hardened into the Applebee's rudeness found at other location.

This is my second time in here., and maybe my last. Food was ok, but I think they skimped on the amount of boneless wings.

Also this is the only restaurant in my life that I have have ever been charged for xtra pickles. The manager made a special visit to notify us that it would be an extra 50 cents.

The food came cold, the soup was semi-warm and the penne was watery and lacked any sort of consistency. Our server was generally pleasant but kept trying to push us to order more food, dessert, etc. repeatedly (one of my biggest turn-offs when going out to eat). I've heard bad things about the Chehalis Applebees before, but this was the first time I had food that looked AND tasted nasty. I know Applebees is on the lower tier of sit-in restaurants, but if I shell out around $11 for a lunch special and Mountain Dew, the MD shouldn't be the best part of the meal.
