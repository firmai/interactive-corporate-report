12,Christine H.,"Calgary, Canada",1,2,1.0,4.0,2014-06-10,"The restaurant was full so we sat at the bar. Comfortable stools, lots of table space and 3 great big screens to watch (it's currently NBA playoff time).  The bartenders were friendly and made sure we menus and drinks.!  The food arrived in a timely manner and did not disappoint. So, good food, great drinks and fantastic staff - 2 thumbs up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
14,Ginger D.,"Calgary, Canada",0,9,,2.0,2014-07-06,"Very disappointing. The wait time was very slow - even though the restaurant was only half full. We have 3 kids - their meals were sadly lacking.  The hamburgers came with just a bun - no asking if they wanted any toppings, condiments. Just dry bun with meat.  The Kraft Mac and cheese looked like the cheese had clumped on the macaroni - maybe added after macaroni was cold?  The enchilada was extremely dry and the half rack of ribs that were promised to be juicy were also very dry with little flavour. I asked for ketchup for the kids but actually used it to help moisten the ribs to make them easier to eat.  The Chili's chain used to be one of our favorite places to eat.  I am so disappointed in this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
11,Karen K.,"Calgary, Canada",3,5,4.0,4.0,2014-08-10,"We were able to make a reservation for a Saturday night by phone, even though the web site said there was no availability. We were seated promptly and were quickly served drinks while waiting for the other guests in our party.  The appetizer platter seemed a bit lacklustre, but the guacamole made fresh to your specs at table side was amazing. Would recommend Chilis serve this with more substantial taco chips as these  were too flimsy for the chunky guacamole and kept breaking up. Four different entrees - all were good. My husband really liked the seasoning on his steak sandwich.  Good, filling fare at a reasonable cost. Attentive and friendly servers. Will definitely be back. Recommended - Bellinis, guacamole and steak sandwich. Skip - south west egg rolls, buffalo chicken",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
10,Sara L.,"Calgary, Canada",1,3,,1.0,2014-09-04,"Have been to many Chilis restaurants, and this by far, exhibited the worst service I have ever experienced. First off...we were the only table in the restaurant, aside from the employees hanging out around the bar...and our server still couldn't seem to keep up. I had to get up to go to where his ""party"" was at the bar to get a refill, and then when he finally brought our appy, he didn't bring cutlery, plates, or napkins. So then we had to wait again, and hunt him down again. So all in all, food was decent, service horrendous. Will not be coming back to this location, which is sad because I live in this area and eat out often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
7,Caitlin S.,"Calgary, Canada",0,2,2.0,1.0,2014-12-30,"I came in for dinner on a Tuesday night around 6:30 and was extremely disappointed with this new location. While the food was good, & our waitress was friendly, the restaurant was disgusting and seemed very understaffed.  The floor was covered in squished french fries among other foods and that was not just under one table, nor was anything done about it in the hour and a half we were dining. The table beside us was also full of dirty dishes that were not touched from the time we arrived to the time we left. The fact that the parts of the restaurant in which customers are in are not kept clean is not only unsightly for those trying to enjoy a meal, but also makes you wonder how clean/sanitary the kitchen is.. Will be bringing our business back to the Southcentre location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
15,Danielle-Kyle J.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,9,,1.0,2015-01-31,We have been to this chilis 3 times. First time was good. Service was fast and food was good. Second time was horrible. We ended up leaving before or dinner came out and they probably didn't notice because it was an 1 hr wait. We decided to try it out again tonight. What a horrible mistake. Service was slow and food was not what you would expect. I ordered a steak sandwich and it was so small I could finish it in two bites and it only cost $17. Then my friends wife ordered a room temperature water that took almost 30 mins to arrive. She went to drink it and it was boiling hot. She didn't notice how hot it was because it was in a pop mug. It ended up burning her tongue and the inside of her mouth to a blister point. They gave us a small discount on our meal but that was it. I'm really disappointed because we really love chilis and was excited to hear it was in our area. Don't go unless you want to have a bad experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
6,Bret R.,"Calgary, Canada",0,7,,1.0,2015-07-17,"Wow, service was none existent. After saying we would be seated in ""just a minute"", we sat and watched as they sat anyone and everyone that walked in! When we tried to ask about this, she walked away. Not a place I would go back to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
13,Rob M.,"Calgary, Canada",34,5,2.0,1.0,2015-09-06,"Food was all microwave cooked nothing their is fresh, drinks were horrible they need a real bartender at that location. Just has bad as macdonalds",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
9,Jenni Jane K.,"Calgary, Canada",127,18,3.0,1.0,2015-12-04,"First time at this chain. Looking at the menu thought it might be promising or even hold up to maybe the Cactus Club...NOT. The service here was TERRIBLE. We had a trainee and server, the two of them seemed to have no idea how to do their jobs, big fail. I order fajitas and the tortillas came warm 20 minutes before anything else and were totally cold by the time the actual tops came. We had to wait 15 mins in between drinks for another and they kept forgetting everything. Certainly didn't feel like a night out for dinner, complete waste of money. The food was Meh:( Honestly, go eat anywhere else. Worst place I've been to in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
8,Paul B.,"Calgary, Canada",38,33,,4.0,2016-02-24,"This review is based on one visit from last year for a group event. We had 20 to 30 people and all were served reasonably fast and almost at the same time. This is not an easy thing to do and I applaud Chili's for that. I don't remember any surprises either, but I am not some kind of picky gourmet who complains about the crust being 36% excessive. As a chain, Chili's felt very average but reliable. What I liked about the chain is that the menu seemed a bit lighter than that of competitors. This is not the kind of place where everyone would need a take home box.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
3,Negin N.,"Calgary, Canada",62,82,51.0,2.0,2016-03-24,"We've been here a few times (never my choice) and I have been disappointed every time. The service is so slow even when the restaurant isn't busy. Then when you finally get your food don't expect the server to come back and check in with you until you're ready to pay...which by the way, you need to wait forever to do. The portions aren't great. I have been to the Chili's in the NE and the service is much better there. Wouldn't recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
5,Trey N.,"Beltline, Canada",0,6,,4.0,2016-06-24,I love Chili's but they have gone a bit south since I used to eat there a couple times a week. This Chili's is pretty good. Lunch is really cheap and the food is good but not great. Overall I liked it and for lunch time I'd hit it up again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
4,Jen A.,"Southeast Calgary, Calgary, Canada",0,1,,1.0,2017-01-08,We came here Friday night. Two of us ordered steak med rare. They both were very well done.  I ordered pasta and it was barely cooked. The server didn't seem to interested in us. We barely saw her. We defiantly won't be coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
1,G R.,"Southeast Calgary, Calgary, Canada",0,2,4.0,1.0,2017-01-31,"DO NOT EAT HERE! GOT SICK FROM THIS PLACE! My boyfriend and I came in on a Monday night. There were about 15 people eating there. No one was at the front and it took them 5 minute to notice us and another 10 for someone to come over and take our order. Our server introduced herself as NOT our server. Bizarre. It didn't seem that busy. I wanted to ask where our actual server was. Didn't matter, none of my business We just put in an order for egg rolls as an appy and 2 steals.  1 med and 1 med rare.  The egg rolls came on top of shredded lettuce that were  old and brown. But since the lettuce wasn't why we ordered it, we just ate the rolls. Our steaks came 37 minutes later (I timed it with my phone) and not only were they Medium well, they were also BURNT.  It doesn't make any sense to me that it took them that long to grill steaks on a none-busy night and have them come out less than acceptable. If it weren't for my side order of gravy, I wouldn't have even been able to eat it. Pretty much had to pay $80 for nonexistent service, mediocre appy and potentially cancerous meat.  We usually don't complain about service or food but on the same night, I started to have an upset stomach which kept me up all night and my boyfriend had the same thing happen the next morning and throughout the day. Needless to say, we are not coming back at this location. I am not only disappointed, I am annoyed about how much money it cost me just to get sick. We should have just stayed home and cooked the meal ourselves. Same out come, just less expensive ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
2,Keneicha F.,"Calgary, Canada",31,9,,4.0,2017-07-26,We have yet to have a bad meal at chillis having dined for lunches and dinners. That being said the last time that we dined we were bombarded with the most horrible children in a restraunt i have ever experianced. It was to the point that people with other children were uncomfortable. Managment did drop the ball for us here... our service was not up to standard 6 dads at one table 6 mums at another and 8ish 10yrold boys running wild at extremly loud levels (all one party) seemed to get all of the attention service and consideration,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
0,Darren J.,"Calgary, Canada",15,208,1547.0,4.0,2017-10-06,One many sit down restaurants on 130th SE Calgary and definitely underrated.  Restaurant is very clean and staff is extremely friendly.  Price is on par with the competitors and these is a kids menu too.  Lots of booth seating and bar section and many TVs throughout entire restaurant.  Been here many times now and have had consistent hot food and great service.  New menu now and can't go wrong coming here for lunch or dinner. Overall this Chili's is fantastic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-5,,,,,
