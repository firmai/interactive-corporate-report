2,Tim S.,"Hollywood, FL",421,366,3316.0,4.0,2015-06-08,"I feel obliged to write a review as no one else has stepped up yet.  Ambiance, very American. This would be a strength for many people. Especially this who had too much local water and had Montazumas Revenge affect their opinion of of the local drinks, mole y tacos.  Many would be dying for some American food fare.  Me, I wish it was a over the top amazing tacuería to Hit before You Leave.  Service, seriously if you have bad service in Mexico they just don't like you. Always a smile, always glad to say a happy word.  Mexico as a whole may have some of the best customer service anywhere.   Food,    , ,  it'sTGIFridays.  What else you want.  Definitely a nice spot to stop in the airport.   The other options are cafeteria like so stop in here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
4,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",412,791,4718.0,3.0,2015-09-05,"Once we were done with our shopping we still had some time to kill before our flight , most of the food in this terminal seems to be cafeteria style not bad but if u want to have a sit down meal Fridays would be the place to go.  Big place , lots of seating & bar area up front we sat in the bar area.  Once seated we got our menu's drinks I tried the Raspberry iced tea , really good tasting ice tea.  Friends tried a regular & Strawberry Mojitos , regular not bad strawberry comes with its own shaker all part of the presentation they said not bad.  Food we had The Chicken Finger BLT sandwich comes with fries , good sandwich good tasting chicken with bacon & lettuce very tasty fries were good as well although by the time they brought it the fries were a little cold.  We also had a Caribbean Chicken sandwich this comes with sweet potato fries , good sandwich the avocado goes well with the sandwich, sweet potato fries were really good interesting combo.  We also tried the Broccoli & cheese soup this was pretty good.  Service was a bit slow but all the waiters that did serve us were nice & friendly , prices were decent food is what u come to expect from any Fridays nothing crazy but good enough. everything we had was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
9,James H.,"San Francisco, CA",4,126,27.0,2.0,2015-12-11,Friendly waiter.   Terrible food although sanitary.   No atmosphere.   And I can't figure out why they don't have wifi.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
7,Nicole N.,"Milwaukee, WI",35,50,5.0,3.0,2016-08-08,"Food was pretty good, ordered the buffalo nachos and sesame chicken strips. The service was terrible though. The waiter  was indifferent and we had to ask several times for him to take our bill. The people behind us waited so long they canceled their order and left. Never came to refill our sodas. Do yourself a favor & eat at the terminals. Also, don't ask for water, they bring you bottles that cost $3 each.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
6,Andrea R.,"Lawndale, CA",10,37,32.0,1.0,2016-11-26,"I ordered their baby back ribs before boarding my 6 hour flight and they gave me food poisoning.  My husband had their chicken fajitas, and he feels a bit unwell too, but it was mostly me. I traveled with high fever...it was awful. Please stay away from here they are not sanitary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
3,Ed O.,"Toronto, Canada",26,4,,1.0,2017-01-07,"FOOD POISONING. Ate here on 1 January 2017 had the Texan chilli cheeseburger, five hours later was sweating and had the shakes. Later that night had diarrhoea, vomiting and fever. Was unwell for three full days and still not 100% a week later. Avoid this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
8,Santiago A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,5.0,1.0,2017-02-25,This place is outright awful. Do not order any cocktails from this dump. We ordered a mojito and it was full of these black bruised leaves they called mint. We requested a new one and he fished out the leaves with his hands and brought it back still full of pieces of leaves. When our order finally arrived it was barely warm. I'm sure it sat in the kitchen for a long time before they brought it out. Worst experience I've had at a TGI Friday's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
5,Socorro A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-03-17,"Service was terrible, but our meal was good. Soda was flat and we asked to replace it. Server brought back watered down soda that was carbonated. Our guess is that he added carbonated water. Our appetizer came after our meal was brought to table, after we reminded him. Also, silverware was brought after meal was brought to table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
0,Cynthia J.,"Houston, TX",134,189,970.0,3.0,2017-05-07,"Decided to have breakfast here before an early flight out of Mexico City. I don't think Fridays in the States serves breakfast ( because I would never go to TGIFs, duh), but I was in the mood for pancakes so away. we. went ( my mum and I).  We both ordered decaf coffee and I got the pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon and my mum got french toast with sausage. The food was decent, warm, and hit the spot. We both enjoyed every bit of our breakfast. Our waiter was cool if a bit hyper but we enjoyed his sense of humor.  Place was pretty clean. They even had a bar tender there bright and early. Darlin' don't tempt me ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
1,Sergey S.,"San Mateo, CA",11,15,1.0,2.0,2017-10-21,"The food was OK. My issue was with a waiter who asked if I'm going to pay with cash or credit card. I decided to pay in american dollar cash. The waiter converted it from $950 pesos into $70 US dollars. The amount seemed high for pasta, salad, burger and 2 kids pastas, but I paid including extra  tips. Later I checked the amount was suppose to be $50. Beware if you paying in cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-canc%C3%BAn-2,,,,,
