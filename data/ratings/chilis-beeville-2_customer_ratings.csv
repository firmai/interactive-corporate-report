20,Michelle S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,,1.0,2012-08-10,Not worth the time or money! Ordered for kids and waiter brought out 2 kids chicken crispers with chipotle barbaque sauce and said nothing. They were almost tears it was soo hot! Took 30 more minutes to get remade. They were out of drinks forever!!!! Very poor service and jack of attention on his part. They were not busy either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2?start=20,,,,,
18,Laura Z.,"Beeville, TX",9,6,1.0,1.0,2014-05-10,"If ever I could give a minus, tonight would be such occasion. I don't understand why the kitchen would find it necessary to totally disregard a person's order. I ordered the crispy chicken tacos. They're suppose to be prepared (as per the menu) with applewood bacon, 3 cheese combo, diced tomatoes and a drizzle of chipotle sauce. I asked for them to hold the tomatoes. What I received was chicken strips laying on tortillas. That's it. I questioned the waitress. She said that all of the ""fixings"" came together as a ""slaw"" and if I didn't want some of it then none of it could be put on there....  Excuse me, but what? So she offered to bring me the ""slaw"" that they omitted from my tacos on a plate. The plate she brought me was shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes. That's it. Hmmmm..... I told her that I wanted to know where the 3 cheese trio and the bacon went to? She took the plate and said she would have them ""remake"" it. Why did I think they could get it right the second time? This time it came out...tortillas with one chicken strip on it covered in lettuce and tomatoes with a couple of shreds of cheese that you still had to look for and still no bacon. Then they threw the pico de gallo on top of the black beans instead of the tacos.  I refused to eat it and they made it out that they were doing me a FAVOR by removing it off my ticket. Wow. Now I remember why it's been such a long time since I've been here. It will be even longer after this experience. And I never got a refill of my tea which it took her halfway through my little girl's meal to ever bring me.   Want food the way it's described on the menu or the way you want it? Don't just skip this place, RUN!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
16,Mark G.,"Kilgore, TX",24,243,13.0,4.0,2014-06-21,"Suppa one night- lunch the next day- Reading the previous reviews from a couple years ago are just that. A couple of years old. Def improvement. New management. Experienced management.  Service was decent enough. We weren't neglected at any time regardless of the group size. The staff is well trained. The program works.  Food was good. Nothing but empty plates. During either meal, the delivery was timely.  I just don't like the machines at the table. The tablets. I guess I need to get used to them. It's coming to a town near you! If in town and want to play it safe, this is not a gamble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
19,Charlotte J.,"Spring, TX",3,23,8.0,1.0,2014-06-22,I always get sick here. I keep giving this place chances but I shouldn't. I won't anymore. I'm pretty sure they mess with the food. Yuck! Service is bad and the wait time is terrible. No one goes for the food. Everyone packs around the bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
10,Elissa L.,"Beeville, TX",0,1,1.0,2.0,2015-01-20,"My oldtimer burger with cheese was dry and the cheese looks gross like it was sitting for a while. It was supposed be medium rare, it was completely cooked, almost burnt. My salads were good but were warm. And my tea was already watered-down.  I ordered from the to go menu but got there early to avoid my food getting cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
9,Bryan M.,"Indianapolis, IN",11,107,263.0,1.0,2015-03-30,"Why did I doubt you yelp? I saw the bad reviews and blamed it on yelp brats. I should have listened.     We entered and were seated immediately. The booth was dirty. I had to sweep crushed chips out of the booth before I could sit down.  They were really busy, but there is no excuse to seat someone in a dirty booth.      Our server was actually pretty nice. Not well trained, but nice. We ordered fried pickles, which my wife liked a lot. I did not. They were really thick and the breading fell off. I dropped at least three in the ranch. I had chicken tortilla soup which was good. Definitely worth paying a little more for a bowl versus a cup. Our entrees were also good. My wife had the ribeye, which she liked a lot. I had a bacon chicken quesadilla which was also good. Overall our meal wasn't bad. The experience ruined it.         The staff here was ridiculous. While we ate, another waiter came out and loudly greeted a friend at the table behind us. Which would have actually been fine if he hadn't leaned on the booth we shared and rocked it the whole time. Shortly after that, a loud young woman came and sat at the table on the other side of us with her boyfriend after busing it herself. They sat with their drinks and talked very loudly. It became apparent that she was an employee when she made several trips in and out of the kitchen. All of this began to make sense when the manage materialized and began talking into his earpiece like he worked for the secret service. I haven't had an experience this disappointing in a very long time.         Heed my warning! Unless this is the very last place on earth don't eat here. I will never doubt you again yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
14,Shannon R.,"Beeville, TX",0,5,,1.0,2015-05-02,"Cold food that was served in a hot skillet, how does that even....? Saw our waitress twice, when we ordered drinks but someone else brought them to us, and when she took our order. We got no refills and no check. It wasn't busy. We paid through the little kiosk thing, left no tip. Will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
17,Diana R.,"Midland, TX",0,4,2.0,3.0,2015-05-19,Awesome BLT and chicken sandwich.   Ordered take out.  My Molly just loved everything about it.  Just awesome.   Recommend highly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
15,Suzie B.,"Beaumont, TX",0,4,,1.0,2015-10-17,"I just paid $35.00 for lunch at Chilis that was so horrible we could not eat it!!!  My son had the triple appetizer with cheese bites and mini hamburgers and onion rings.  He had originally wanted the boneless buffalo wings but they were out so he wanted the bone in wings but they were out of those also!  Then ordered onion rings but told server he changed his mind and ordered the chicken crispers.  Order came out with onion rings!  He only ate his mini burgers but said they were not good, other items were not good and didn't eat them.  I had the Caribbean salad, it was soggy lettuce with tasteless ""grilled"" chicken!  It was just horrible!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
13,Jay P.,"Aransas Pass, TX",2,2,4.0,1.0,2015-12-05,Everything else was okey but we got dirty spoons and forks. It's should have cleaned at least. I would never recommend chilies restaurant  in beeville. I would recommend Taqueria Jalisco is the best one for Mexican food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
12,Mimi Z.,"Austin, TX",0,104,,3.0,2016-01-24,It's your regular run-of-the-mill Chili's. Nothing special. This bar is a lot quicker than some of the other ones I've been to though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
7,Therese S.,,2,44,30.0,5.0,2016-04-07,"Came on a Thursday. Sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive.  Checked on me frequently.  Recommended the Presidente Margarita.  I was resistant at first because it contains Brandy and I'm really fussy about my margaritas.  Turned out to be awesome.  I ordered the triple dipper for my meal.  I chose the big mouth bites (burgers), southwestern eggrolls, and boneless wings with creamy jalapeño.  Food was served hot and fresh.  The chicken crispers were not too spicy.  Had a wonderful experience.  Would definitely come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
8,Tibby L.,"George West, TX",0,19,28.0,2.0,2016-05-02,I would give this place no stars if possible but the waitress tried so hard to over come the awful food and the disgusting drinks. I actually felt terrible for her. It had to be trying to serve bad food in a dirty restaurant and trying your hardest to make up for it with great service. I applaud her because I would have slapped the cook with that petrified asparagus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
5,Laura J.,"Freeport, TX",44,14,10.0,1.0,2016-05-29,"Came into town a couple of days early to scope things out before an interview. After a three hour drive, a drink, chips and salsa sounded like a good way to wrap up the night. Apparently smoking is not verboten here, because the bar had several smokers polluting the air. We moved to a table, and even though all we planned to order were some chips and salsa, no one stopped to ask us if we wanted anything. The restaurant doesn't close for another 20 minutes and they are still bringing food out to other tables. When my husband pointed out the dirty fork lying on the back of my seat, I lost my appetite. Going to pay for my drink and definitely look for another place to eat tomorrow. This place is gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
11,Allen W.,"Canton, MI",22,3,1.0,1.0,2016-06-22,"I ordered a premium Long Island ice tea which was pretty tasty. After a couple of sips, I discovered that the glass was chipped.  I let the server know and she was happy to bring me another drink. The drink that arrived was mostly sour mix and and soda. The server was kind enough to bring me a beer instead. I ordered a rare ribeye which ended up being medium rare.  At that point I decided that if I sent it back I would get special seasoning on my steak.  I travel for work and have had many great experiences at Chili's. This experience was disappointing as I have come to expect more from their restaurants. Maybe I caught them I a bad night. I will never know because I will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
6,Rory M.,"Cibolo, TX",13,70,64.0,3.0,2016-07-24,"This place is so hit or miss I don't know WHAT to review. The food in not the best, making it over priced. It could be a LOT cleaner. But, the service has been relatively consistent and good (depending on how packed it is) which is why I gave 3 stars and not 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
4,Helena N.,"Victoria, TX",1,1,1.0,4.0,2017-04-26,My waitress was super nice. Food did take a little long but thatd always haooen st any location of chilllis. Overall a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
2,Grayson H.,"Austin, TX",196,14,1.0,2.0,2017-12-16,"Not the best Chili's out there. Service extremely slow and not the best. But it's a small town in south Texas, so what can you really expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
1,Penny H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,11,6.0,1.0,2017-12-22,First impression.  You walk in front door & see the trash in the bar was overflowing  & all over floor. Saw a roach crawling on wall. Yuck. Walked past kitchen to go to restroom. OMG!!!NASTY Looked grimy & dirty. Don't know how they past health inspection.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
3,Sandra B.,"La Vernia, TX",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-29,"It took 10 minutes to get our drinks ordered, but we had to ask hostess for a waitress. The salad was horrible soggy and brown lettuce. I hope this is not their typical service. It was crowded due to holidays. We will probably not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
0,Shelby W.,"Stephenville, TX",51,41,,3.0,2018-01-02,"Hit or miss... came two nights after hunting. Frozen margaritas were great. Spinach  h queso was good, boneless wings were terrible ! Mexican food was decent",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beeville-2,,,,,
