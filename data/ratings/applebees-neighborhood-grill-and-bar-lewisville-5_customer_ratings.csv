41,David D.,"Hot Springs Village, AR",65,380,26.0,2.0,2012-01-29,"Had a gift certificate and decided to pop in and use it on a weeknight.  First impression was that we walked into a smoking pit.  Normally, the smell doesn't bother me but at a family restaurant I was surprised at the strength.  We were seated and the booth felt like a hundred year old mattress.  Note to management:  Replace the cushions.   I will say this, the server was ontime and attentive, no problem with the service we received.  However, the food was less than good. Both my wife and I had a shrimp and steak dish and the shrimp were cold.  The vegetables were weak and overall very unappetizing.  We informed the server and she had the manager come over and address the situation.  The manager was very nice and offered remedies.  We don't normally accept discounts or offers to refire the dish because we don't want to appear that we are looking for something for nothing.  We just want the management to know of the problem, he was very gracious and talked to us for a couple of minutes and we believe that he will address the problem, too bad the qualifty control isn't up to par in the kitchen. Sorry, but unless someone gives us another gift certificate I believe we will choose to dine elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5?start=40,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002
50,Rick K.,"Dallas, TX",28,65,,1.0,2012-02-17,"Pros:  I didn't get food poisoning. I don't think anyone spit in my food. Oh, and it's cheap Cons: Slow, virtually nonexistent service, bland, inadequately prepared food.  It's not often that I drop the comparison, ""worse than Hitler"". But for Applebee's?  Nah, I'll save that for something else... Actually I equate Applebee's to those cartoons where the befuddled yet weary protagonist encounters a desert mirage.  Bugs, or whoever, discovers a palm tree oasis, only to ultimately dive face first into just another pile of sand.  Here in the 3D world, we sought sustenance after a drunken evening at the broom closet that is Hattricks (fodder for a future Yelp).  After 11pm most of the casual dining joints shut down in the Lewisville area.  The apple shaped beacon visible from the highway promised more beers and some quality grub.  Wrong. Wrong. Service was extremely slow, exacerbated by the fact our server had friends at a nearby table. We ordered several appetizers, as they were half priced after 11. It was readily apparent our order had been sitting under a heat lamp, significantly reducing the crunch and flavor of our selections. The onion rings were bearable.  I'm not sure if I've ever seen a manager at an Applebee's. Do they exist? Look, we've all been to Applebee's. We go for the same reasons. It sucks, but is a necessary evil on occasion.  Then why the hell am I penning this review to tell you what you already know?  It's just a reminder for me to seek grub elsewhere.  Bon appetite, and stuff...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5?start=40,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003
37,Kate R.,"Dallas, TX",80,421,62.0,1.0,2012-06-27,"I don't think I'll ever be coming back to Applebee's ever again. Not just this location, but any of them... I stopped by this Applebee's about a week ago with my crazy friend M when we were starving STARVING. We were so hungry, we were about to start gnawing on our own arms.  So you'd think that with that level of hunger, anything would taste like the nectar of the gods/the most amazing thing ever/YUM FOOD GIMMIE NOM NOM.  Sadly, that was not the case.  First of all, when we walked in, we stood alone at the door for quite a while. When someone finally came up, we made our way to the smoking section (less crowded and slightly less noisy, until the hyena-woman in the bar area started cackling) and sat.  Our waitress was friendly enough, I guess, but she really didn't care. Our Dr Peppers were disgusting. The soda/syrup ratio was so so incredibly off that even in our states of absolute hunger and thirst, we couldn't force it down. When we brought it to our waitresses attention she was just like, ""ummm.. I can mention it..."" and offered water or another beverage instead. She just didn't care.  The menu is standard Applebee's underwhelming fare. I used to like one thing at Applebee's (it was so many years ago, I completely forgot what it was called), and of course they took it off the menu. Nothing on their menu strikes me as terribly unique. They DO have their ""Under 550 calories"" section, and I eventually picked an item from there since it seemed to be the least offensive item.  ...and it was gross. It was the Chicken w/mushrooms thing. Grilled chicken topped with mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, Dijon sauce (which I had them leave off), and an 'aged Cheddar'. The chicken itself wasn't bad. It was cooked well. the mushrooms were alright, but the onions were overwhelming. The cheese was weird. Cheddar is typically an excellent melting cheese. This cheese didn't melt. It kind of congealed and browned without melting. It had a weird flavor and a bad aftertaste. I removed the clump o cheese, the onions/tomatoes, and just ate the chicken with some mushrooms. That was alright. Not worth the $10+ I paid, but palatable. The small portion of potatoes was good. The veggies were decent, but more wilted than fresh-looking. Our waitress was mostly absent and when she was there, she just didn't care. She asked how everything was because she had to, but we probably could've said ""It tastes like death!"" and she would've responded 'great, great. let me know if you need anything!'.  Overall, it was a standard Applebee's experience. I am continually underwhelmed by their boring, mediocre, reheated from frozen food.  For what it's worth, the people behind us were smoking clove cigarettes which made me want to vomit the whole time they were there. Most places (that still allow smoking) don't allow anything other than plain cigarettes. Apparently, Applebee's doesn't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5?start=20,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004

52,Michelle W.,"Irving, TX",139,56,34.0,2.0,2012-09-24,"This location leaves much to be desired. While other Applebee's locations I have visited as of late have really impressed me with their all around great food, service and atmosphere; this one may as well be an entirely different chain all together.  Upon entering the restaurant; the air is stale, and it smells like everything with a fabric surface needs to be throughly scrubbed. This location looks like it's long overdue for a remodel.  The service was slower than it's other Applebee's counterparts, but the food is actually the most disappointing of the entire visit. My soft drink was lacking enough syrup, so I ordered another variety of soda and it too had the same issue. For an entree I ordered a salad and pasta combo. The salad portion was fine, but it was the pasta portion that was most disappointing. I had ordered this same dish from another Applebee's the week before and it was fresh and delicious, however this one tasted like it had an over abundance of onions that were grilled for another dish. In the original incarnation of this dish, the onions were just an accent, whereas this time at this location, it's like they were added as filler and were not even intended for that dish. It was a big disappointment to be expecting something entirely different.  The service was incredibly slow, I felt like my waitress only checked on my as an after thought. Overall, it's as if this location is on a whole other page altogether. I do enjoy the Applebee's chain very much, but I highly recommend avoiding this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5?start=40,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704,1.704

44,Shay S.,"Dallas, TX",54,156,27.0,3.0,2013-08-04,"Eh. Nothing special. We dropped in for some appetizers and everything was mediocre. I think what I disliked the most was the fact that our waitress was so hard to track down. It seemed like they didn't really think strategically when placing customers at tables. She was having to go across the room and back and forth. But I give a 3/5 because the waitress got our drink orders wrong but then went a head and did not charge us for it, which I thought was nice. I was VERY unsatisfied by the side of shrimp. We just felt like munching so we ordered the 7 grilled shrimps. I was shocked when they brought out 7 tiny pieces of shrimp (the ones smaller than the ones in Chinese food or frozen meals). I have never seen restaurants serve food like that before. It was just very interesting.  I remember the lime salsa being so good but something was just off and the salsa was pretty watery.  This place was just ok.

Allie, our waitress, served with a smile. She was prompt with our drinks, and had a great attitude.  I ordered the 9 oz steak (medium well, slight pink), topped with grilled onions, with corn & red potatoes. Dude, 1st of all I am a corn lover. I can eat corn everyday in every way...tell me how that was the nastiest corn ever! My 8 yr old said it tasted like the cafeteria corn at her school! It was mushy and old...gross! I had 12 red potatoes that were disgusting too..So I asked for french fries instead, which came out 20 mins later. My streak was cooked great as far as it being medium well and juicy, but hell, it tasted so 2nd hand, and T.V.dinnerish...not to mention they forgot my onions, so when they did bring them, they brought me a bowl of the while damn onion grilled. Of course by that time, my steak was cold... My beverage was a sweet tea with kiwi flavor in addition to a Long Island.  My guy had the chicken tenders/fries...um mediocre. We had onion rings for an appetizer, way too breaded, not a good way to start off at all. He ordered a Pepsi that tasted like Root beer, and exchanged it for a Sierra Mist, which we all know is just a bootleg Sprite. Now....the 1st time we came to this location, was around last year....The grease they used to cook our food was burnt! So yes, the onion rings, chicken tenders was hella gross...The manager came out like he didnt care, went in the back in the kitchen and never came back out, so of course we left without paying for that garbage.  I am so disappointed with Applebee's. This used to be my spot about 10 years ago, hands down. Drinks, spinach dip, the sampler, etc. And now it's literally like a dump. If, and that's only if, I come back, it woukd have to be by invite, I'd only come for drinks.  When I told Allie about how my check was not worth friggin $52.00, she went and told her manager and knocked off $15bucks, still the sh*t wasn't worth $36, but I had to satisfy my curiosity that was misled by the commercials so it was partially my fault. Now normally management comes out when there is an issue and of course he/she did not, and I wrote on the receipt this same frustration.

Where as my buddies got the chips & salsa and boneless buffalo wings. I guess their food was OK. Mine on the other hand... Gross! 10 wings $9.99, they were pretty small compared to the likes of pluckers or Hooters. The texture, dry and over sauced which wasn't at all spicy.

I called ahead to make sure they had them. We got there a little before 11 and I immediately sat down and ordered the dessert with an extra scoop of ice cream. After 20 minutes the blondie came out... without the extra scoop of ice cream. I told her about the ice cream and she immediately apologized and went back to get it. We poured the sauce on top that was so thick it was more the consistency of butter than the traditional syrup consistency and went to dig the spoon in and couldn't even cut a piece off. Immediately we could smell it was so burnt. She came back with the ice cream and I told her the brownie was black on the bottom. She immediately took it. The manager never came over and addressed it. He walked around looking like he was the maddest/saddest person alive. After another 10 minutes she brings out the next blondie. This time we got the same terrible consistency topping and it was literally a tablespoon worth (it usually comes with 1/3 cup ish). We spread out the topping and went to take a bite. Although we could cut into the top the entire bottom was gone. At this point it was getting late, we were tired and didn't see the waitress or manager. We cut off the bottom and ate it, paid for it and left. The attentiveness of the manager was terrible. He should always check on the table when an item has been returned.

No way are we spending money here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
11,Toni O.,"Mineral Wells, TX",0,9,,1.0,2017-10-27,"Absolutely horrible establishment!  I went today for my son's birthday for dessert. We ordered his dessert and a Margarita for myself. The waitress brings out drinks and served mine with a nice little disgusting bug in it! She takes it back per my request and returned with another Margarita. Now, I am pretty grossed out, but I kept my cool. I left the new Margarita at the corner of the table. The manager comes over, laughs and asked if I was served with a fly in my drink. I said,indeed and I don't want another as I know they make this pre-mixed and it could have more bugs. The manager took my drink and says, ""sometimes we get bugs in here""then, proceeds to take the drink back to the bar. The manner less bartender yells out what's wrong with this drink? I yelled if I didn't want the first drink with the bug,a second was not going to cut it! We walked out! Hungry, disappointed at our treatment, and disgusted by your environment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
0,Marina R.,"Dallas, TX",91,119,273.0,5.0,2017-11-09,"This is the first Applebees I've been too that I have YET to have a bad experience with. Each time I visit I'm seated promptly, I have a nice waiter/waitress, and my food is always great. It really helps that they have daily drink specials as well - usually I end up here after a bad day haha. If you want to live through me, here is my typical order:  Appetizer: Spinach Artichoke Dip Entree: 8oz. Sirloin cooked MEDIUM with double steamed broccoli  Drinks:  2 Washington apple shots (at least)  The food here is honestly not bad, and I think you'd be surprised at the flavor of their steak.  Parking here is amazing & plentiful. They offer curbside to go if that's your thing.  Visit this location - it's better than the rest.

9,Rick M.,"Lewisville, TX",19,13,38.0,5.0,2017-11-14,"Absolutely no issues with food or service.  I had no wait at all to be seated or to meet my server. Appetizer hit the table in 6 minutes. And the food 5 minutes later. Aaron, our server was engaging and positive the entire meal. The place was not loud or obnoxious and the mix in the music was not enough to drive anyone running for the car. Overall a great experience that lead into an epic night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

6,Jocelin F.,"Weslaco, TX",1,15,3.0,1.0,2017-12-18,"I would not be returning back here. I don't even know where to begin. First our waiter never brought our drinks or utensils. Then after everyone else in my table got their food i was left waiting about 45 minutes to get mine. The waiter never came to ask how we were doing or if we wanted refills. We also ended up paying more than we should have even after my meal was ""free"". Very disappointed that we did not get to enjoy our experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lewisville-5,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
