1,Emma B.,"Orlando, FL",54,283,429.0,3.0,2017-07-15,"It has been years since I'd been here. I always stay away from the mixed drinks and they're over priced and not much alcohol. Soft drinks are free refills which is always a plus. The Jack Daniels sesame seed chicken is still a stand out item on their menu. You can now load your fries with Sam Adams Beer Cheese, however it's very overpriced at a £2 up charge for literally a tablespoon of cheese sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-northampton,,,,,
