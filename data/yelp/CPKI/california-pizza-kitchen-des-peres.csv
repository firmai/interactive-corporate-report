Steven Y.,"Maryland Heights, Saint Louis, MO",14,155,52,5.0,2/19/2016,"When my fiance and I were shopping at West County mall and she suggested California Pizza Kitchen I said I didn't really feel like pizza. However, I obviously had no idea that they had so much more! We got their tortilla spring rolls as an appetizer and they were so good. My fiance got the Thai Chicken Pizza and I got the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with shrimp and chicken. Everything was fantastic, the atmosphere was great, and the service was amazing! We will most DEFINITELY be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Fran M.,"Saint Louis, MO",193,148,718,4.0,5/1/2013,"I love this CPK! It's located next to Macy's and Barnes and Noble at West County Center...perfect because that's my favorite place to park at the mall! I've tried several items off the menu, and it's all good...really...but I found my new favorite...Carnitas Tacos! OMG. I'm craving as we speak...or type...or whatever. The food bliss craving going on in my head is responsible for the quality of this ramble.  These tacos were sooo good. The pork was crispy, the avocado and pico was super fresh, and the whole dish had just the right amount of spiciness. I'll keep going back just for this meal. The service was fantastic and fast, and of course the price is just right.  This spot is great place to eat, mall people watch, and rest your weary bones after a day of shopping...and then you can roll yourself out the door to the parking lot just a few steps right outside.  But that's just me. Come experience this food wonder spot for yourself!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Robert J.,"Fenton, MO",46,129,26,4.0,12/27/2013,"Always been a fan of CPK and I have to stay they rarely dissapoint me.  I do admit that I usually don't stray from my usual menu items though. Just about everything I have tasted here is good.  There is something to say about a chain restaurant and that is you can always expect consistency, good or bad. I often get the BBQ chicken salad.  The flavors in this salad really come together.  The BBQ and ranch work well together.  There is just enough BBQ sauce that it adds the flavor you want.  The tortilla strips add the texture and crunch.  It is hard to not get this because it tastes so good.  The Thai Chicken Pizza is my second favorite.  I love the peanut sauce.  All their pizzas have a really good crust, it is cooked well on the bottom but not too crispy.  Basically you can't go wrong with any of the salads, they are always fresh and look very appetizing when served.  Same with the pizzas,  consistenlty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Jason B.,"Ballwin, Saint Louis, MO",19,101,269,5.0,2/16/2014,My first time ever going to a California pizza kitchen.  I got the spinach artichoke dip of an app very good.  Got the famous BBQ chicken pizza.  Very good the crust was awesome.

Jonina S.,"Saint Louis, MO",86,118,2,4.0,1/2/2013,"I have gone to this location several times simply because I can shop afterward plus I really like the small plates menu. They are all good but I like these the most....arugala salad, chicken quesadilla (not too spicy),  white corn guacamole, and the Mediterranean Focaccia. This place is obviously packed around any meal time. The wait time is reasonable if it is. The hostesses are nice and always courteous. The waiters and waitresses are always attentive and definitely nice.  Some times waiting for our food can take a bit longer than it should, in my opinion.  Their food is always pretty great. If I had to offer what NOT to get is the Irish coffee and hot chocolate. That is NOT Irish coffee the way it's been made for me...sweet and not bitter. Their hot chocolate is more like water. You are just better off with water!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Margo C.,"Saint Louis, MO",65,137,,5.0,11/15/2012,"The gift that keeps on giving! This last weekend CPK thanked our veterans with a free pizza of choice and a non-alcoholic beverage. My husband stopped in while I was shopping and got a Pepperoni Pizza and a Latte. He took the pizza home for our son who is a college graduate. He still lives at home and we still feed him ( I blame Obama ) I keed, I keed. ; )` well, sorta... Anyway, as he was thanking the server she gave him a card which thanked the veteran's for their service.  It included another free pizza and non-alcoholic beverage if used by November 25th. Today, I stopped in and presented the card to my server. She was very cordial. I ordered the Jamacian Jerk Chicken Thin Crust Pizza. It was sweet and spicy at the same time.  CPK not being a Saint Louis Company, I knew I did not have to sweat the Provel thing. The crust was nice and crisp!  Double thanks CPK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20

Holly H.,"Imperial, MO",99,139,154,4.0,3/11/2014,"I've always been a big fan of CPK. It's a great spot to stop for lunch or dinner during a shopping trip at the mall. It's a casual and welcoming place where you can expect to find families, couples, and groups of friends. The food here has always been consistent. CPK is one of the few places where I actually crave a salad. Their salads are SO good! There are several options ranging from your typical cobb, to Asian inspired, to barbeque chicken, to warm roasted veggies... just to name a few! My personal favorite is the chicken waldorf, which consists of grilled chicken, apples, grapes, celery, candied walnuts, and blue cheese set on top a bed of mixed greens and topped with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I'm craving one now just thinking about it! Of course, CPK is known for their pizzas, and for good reason... they are also very tasty! Just as the salads, they offer so many pizza varieties including several unique specialties and a few different crust options to choose from. When I do order pizza, I go with a simple pepperoni on honey wheat crust. Sometimes simple is best. They also offer a number of pasta dishes, and my husband absolutely loves the spicy kung pao spaghetti. All in all, this is a great place to stop and recharge while at West County Mall. They offer a little something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Chris Z.,"Avondale Estates, GA",70,1335,858,3.0,6/26/2013,"This place always hits the spot for me.  Consistently good food, service, at a decent price.  I mowed down a Cobb salad and cheese pizza.  Yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Tami G.,"Milwaukee, WI",146,244,24,4.0,12/10/2010,"Since I work at West County, you can go to the food court so many times before becoming ill just walking by.  Enter CPK.   I stopped here one day for my lunch break and I was able to get right in.  The place wasn't too busy for a weekday, mid afternoon, so this made me happy.  I ordered a Raspberry Tea (thought I would give it a try) and a salad.  I ended up choosing Grilled Vegetable Salad, which has Grilled asparagus, Japanese eggplant, zucchini, green onions and roasted corn, served warm over a bed of chilled Romaine lettuce, fresh avocado and sun-dried tomatoes in a Dijon balsamic vinaigrette.  You have your choice of a half or full portion and if you would like Salmon, shrimp or chicken.  I ended up choosing a half with chicken.  I wasn't a fan of the tea (I am more of regular w/lemon girl) but the salad was so good.  I enjoyed it.  I will frequent for sure (I usually hit up the joint on Olive near Lindbergh in CC).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Jennifer M.,"Richmond Heights, Saint Louis, MO",636,19,1,4.0,6/29/2011,Had a business lunch there today.  We got there around 11:15 so we beat the lunch rush and were seated right away.  Our server Chris was great and even gave us iced tea to go!  I'm a big fan of the BBQ chopped chicken salad and it was delicious.  The person I met with had the CPK Cobb salad and said it was delicious as well.  The service was great and the food was great!  Keep up the good work!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Mark R.,"Saint Louis, MO",6,4,,1.0,12/15/2009,"I'm a little bit late in writing this review but I wanted to give CPK a chance to contact me back...which they didn't.   About a month a go my daughter and I met my wife there for lunch, its one of her favorite places to go.  She orders pasta with a side of broccolini and I order a pizza, and some other pasta for the baby. We're about half way through our meal and my wife gets this terrified look on her face.  I ask her what's wrong?  She hands her fork over and asks if this is what she thinks it is. Yep, it was dead bug...like a small millipede or something.  What's worse is we gave our baby some to eat too...ugh. We call the manager over and show her.  And to her credit she was probably about as grossed out as we were.  She took my wife's plate and asks if she can bring her a new one.  My wife said in a to-go box please because her appetite was gone.  Can't blame her. The waitress comes over and apologizes and said they're taking her meal off the bill.  Okay...that's the least they could do.  Everyone we've told says they couldn't believe they didn't comp our whole meal.  I didn't really mind because I'm not the complainer type looking for free meals.  Well as luck would have it our receipt had one of those survey options on it so when I got home I filled it out.  It was rather lengthy and detailed and had a spot to type in our own comments that would be sent to corporate office.  I thought well I guess I'll use this and see where it goes.  I waited a couple of days and never got a response even though they had me put in my phone and address.  I forgot about it until we passed by there over the weekend.  My wife and I looked at each other and both said, nah we're not ready yet to give it a try yet.   Anyways we normally always love their food but was disappointed that something like this would happen, but its inexcusable to not hear back from them regarding it.    Make sure you check their food before you eat it! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Matt D.,"St Louis, MO",1,13,50,3.0,9/5/2010,Pretty good specialty pizzas.  Only one size makes it difficult to get filled up if you are used to eating a lot so plan on ordering an appetizer.  Food tastes good they just need bigger portions.  This coming from a Guy who can easily eat your average 16 inch pizza by himself though.  Good place for lunch but look elsewhere for supper.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Emily M.,"Saint Louis, MO",77,20,,3.0,4/1/2008,"This past Friday night I had dinner at the California Pizza Kitchen in the West County Mall.  I typically do not like to eat at mall restaurants, but this place is definitely an exception to the rule.  I have yet to have a terrible experience at the Pizza Kitchen.  My past experience has told me the service is good, the food great and the price is just right. My friend and I didn't want to eat too much since it was later in the evening (around 8pm), so we opted to split a Grilled Vegetable salad and the Pesto Cream Penne with Shrimp pasta which is a new dish.   The salad (the smaller size) is plenty for 2 people and was absolutely fresh and delicious.  The vegetables were still warm and included zucchini, sun dried tomatoes, roasted corn, avocado, eggplant and green onions.  It was perfect.  The pasta was decent, it could have been warmer and the sauce was a bit like glue, but it still had pretty good flavor.  It wasn't awful, but I will definitely not order it again.  I'm glad I tried it though.  Our waiter was very friendly and really attentive, but not too attentive.  The food came out in a short amount of time and they brought bread before the meal (which you have to ask for).  The bread is always a bit dry and not that good, but I was starving so I ate it anyway. We had to order the apple crumb dessert with ice cream.  I have to say, I was disappointed in it.  The apples weren't cooked well enough and the crumb tasted a bit like chemicals.  All in all, I would still  recommend either location for the California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20
Bryan P.,"Washington, DC",0,238,,3.0,2/3/2011,"meh.  the food i ordered was certainly adequate, but the portions were inexcusably small.  still, the panzanella salad alone is worth a return trip, just don't expect to leave satisfied unless you're ready spend upwards of twenty bucks per person.  that's simply too much for a quick lunch in a mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres?start=20

Lyndsey N.,"Saint Louis, MO",52,263,268,2.0,11/20/2017,"I understand coming on a weekend that you may have to wait for a table, but when seated, waited at least 15 minutes just for a server to come over to us and get drink orders, also the kung pao spaghetti that I ordered was extremely overcooked with the noodles and not exactly the best tasting, the waldorf salad was delicious but that's it. Finally it took a very long time for our server to come back with our check and just the whole experience was dissatisfying like the service was just as if they didn't care at all. Just because you have a busy night does not mean the service should suffer this badly. I don't want to come back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres
Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1007,1635,3.0,2/27/2017,"I've got to bump California Pizza Kitchen up one star to a 3. It's mostly due to one dish I had off their new menu.  The dish I liked so much is the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower (Fresh cauliflower florets fried to a golden brown with buttermilk batter, then tossed in housemade Sriracha buffalo sauce and topped with a salad of celery, Gorgonzola and cilantro.) The portion was a little light but what a great dish! So flavorful! The service here is still odd but like anything else your experience depends completely on who is there when you are there. Order the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower! This is one of those that I will attempt to replicate at home it was so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres
Eric H.,"Ballwin, MO",0,4,,1.0,12/9/2017,What has happened to CPK at West County Mall? We were seated and waited over 5 min and no one came to our table. We moved to the bar and that was a mistake. The place had a number of dirty tables and the bar was completely dirty. Looking behind the bar the floor was covered in food and gloves. The staff was standing around next to me trying to figure out how to put apps on the iPad. 15 min later we finally received our salad. This place used to a great place to go and get a quick meal; not anymore. At least the bread was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres

Does No one noticed this ???  Also I had asked our server to look up my reward account twice but she kept forgetting until the very end.  Our food was very good as always. But I think cleanliness is very important, a dirty place to sit that I had to brush off myself was not how I imagined to start off my lunch date.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres
Amy M.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,64,3,5.0,12/22/2016,I hadn't been to a CPK for a long time. Went for lunch on a busy day at the mall and was delighted by their lunch specials. Grabbed a spinach mushroom pizza and a spinach/quinoa salad. With a soda my bill was around $15. Waitress was very friendly and brought refills quickly. My companion is gluten free and she had a gf pepperoni pizza that she enjoyed. Fresh bread and olive oil were complimentary. Our orders came out fast. Restrooms were clean.

Kitty W.,"Saint Louis, MO",175,269,2214,3.0,1/12/2016,"Believe it or not, I made my first visit to California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) just a few days ago. I'm 33. We didn't have them in my part of Texas, and although I've lived in St. Louis for six years, my husband always has refused to eat here. He claimed the pizza was too ""exotic"" for him, and he was partially right. He's strictly a pepperoni guy, and CPK has some interesting flavor combinations on the menu. I completely understand how the Thai Chicken or California Club pizzas might intimidate him. I mean, both of those pizzas practically have salads on top of them. That's, like, as far away from pepperoni as you can get.  So, my first visit to CPK ended up being with someone else.  And I learned something. Actually, I've learned a few things. 1. Complimentary bread is served while you wait for your meal. Warning! It's sourdough. 2. They offer only one size of pizza, but their thin-crust pizzas are slightly larger in diameter than their hand-tossed pies. I do not know the diameter size in inches, but the pizzas are larger than a typical personal pizza. Each pizza is cut into six slices. In my opinion, two people could easily share one pizza especially if ordering salads and/or appetizers.  [Note: I actually was surprised they only offered one pizza size. I had been expecting lunch specials with personal pizzas, but I have since discovered some locations have a ""reimagined menu"" with ""lunch duos"": a 7"" pizza or half a sandwich with your choice of soup or salad. Or, simply soup and salad. Selections, however, are greatly limited.]  3. They can make half-and-half pizzas in some cases, but there might be a surcharge. For example, there was a $2 surcharge on my half-Tostada and half-Margherita pizza because the two pizzas had different base sauces.  4. They offer a completely normal pepperoni pizza. Well, it's normal as long as you don't pay extra to add white truffle oil to it. I kind of assumed they must have a classic pepperoni pizza, and my initial visit confirmed it. Guess what that meant! If my first visit was successful (and it pretty much was), the husband could make return visits to CPK with me! No excuses!  5. The crust is foldable. I've now had a ""crispy"" thin-crust and a hand-tossed pizza here, and honestly, the two crusts seemed similar to me. The main difference was around the perimeter of the pizza. The thin-crust pizza had a crispy circumference, while the hand-tossed pizza had a nice, bread-y edge. However, the interior crust of both pizzas was thin and limp. The pizzas were NOT undercooked and had good flavors, but I had to fold the pieces along the radii in order to eat them. 6. You can spend a pretty penny here. Including the tip, my first visit cost $40 for two sodas, a pizza, and a half salad. My second visit ended up being a little cheaper because the husband doesn't drink soda, and I received a free small plate by signing up for their Pizza Dough Rewards. (I selected the asparagus and arugula salad from the small plate menu. Yum! I would definitely order that again!)  --- CPK loses a couple of stars for their limp crust and high prices. I prefer Dewey's, which is somewhat comparable, but I'll be a return customer here for sure. So will my husband. He has conquered his fear of this ""exotic"" pizza place, but because this location is at a mall, his concern now is that I'll make him go to Sephora with me after our meal. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres

Just a basic herb dip.  We all ordered salads. You have a choice between a full or half a salad.  We all ordered half salads and they are a great size.  Mike had the Moraccan (I don't know how to spell that) salad that he said was good, but the inflection in his voice said he probably would not order that again.  He said it had an odd flavor to it. I had the Ceasar Salad with shrimp.  The salad was good, the shrimp were tasty, but what really irritates me is when a restaurant doesn't use real ceasar dressing.  I want to taste the smashed up anchovies in my dressing.  If you don't have that, then you just have creamy Italian dressing.  I would order a different type of salad next time.  My brother's Cobb Salad looked wonderful.   For a chain restaurant, this has good food and a good menu.  This one was located in the West County Mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-des-peres
