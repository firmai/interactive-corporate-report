Marissa C.,"Burke, VA",375,8,,3.0,9/25/2016,Overall a great place. I came here on a date with my boyfriend and we had a great time. The potato skins were hard as a rock and our food didn't come out at the same time so I had to wait a little bit. I'll come back when they bring the food out at the same time so people don't have to feel rude or uncomfortable by starting to eat when not everyone has their food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Rodney M.,"Vienna, VA",149,4,,1.0,10/28/2016,"The worst Friday's I been to in my life, the store wasn't even that busy came here for somebody birthday and the service was slow the waiter ""Los"" barely check up on the table he left the menus on the table the whole entire time, I had to get another server to get are waiter my food was cold the brought everybody food out in differnet times.

Asyiah G.,"Los Angeles, CA",289,3,3,1.0,12/8/2016,this TGIF was absolutely terrible. the service is nowhere near close to being okay. they are rude and don't explain the happy hour deals and try to double charge you to get a bigger too. the staff doesn't know about anything they're talking about. they give out false information each time. I would highly recommend not coming here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60

Andres H.,"Miami Beach, FL",28,2,,2.0,9/1/2016,I usually don't right reviews unless something is extremely great or extremely bad. This is the second time I come here. First time was a bad experience with service. I let it slide but this time the place was fairly empty. We had a party of 7 and it took about 11 minutes to set up two tables and put them together. After we were seated I timed the amount of time it took for someone to come and take our drink order. It took exactly 10 minutes. By this time I was already frustrated with the service and decided to just leave. The waitress was really obnoxious as well. I learned my lesson. Never going there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Daniel R.,"Alexandria, VA",1,11,,5.0,8/10/2016,"I'm not sure what restaurant staff was on duty when these other people went but I went this past Sunday at around 3PM and had an amazing experience. This may be a result of them not being super busy, but who knows. We were seated immediately, and after not too long a gentlemen came up (I'm terrible with names), let us know our regular server would be with us shortly so he would just take our drink order. As our waitress came up (again, terrible with names) she looked like she was going to be an angry person but she was actually very pleasant. My wife and I both did the endless apps and she took our orders with no issues. Our food was out only a few minutes later and it was nice and hot and amazing. When she brought them out she even went ahead and took our order for our next set of appetizers so they'd be out by the time we finished our current set. All in all we had an amazing experience; the food was nice and hot, looked/tasted amazing, and our service was great all around. Maybe people just shouldn't go out and eat during the busiest time of day and expect to be treated like royalty when there's 100 other people also ordering food and demanding help from only a handful of staff. But that's none of my business...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Michelle A.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",3,12,,1.0,8/16/2015,"This was one of the most horrible experiences I've had at a restaurant in awhile. Walked in, was promptly greeted (only positive experience of the night) and a ""host in training"" took us to our table. He mumbled a lot of information that was not necessary such as I'm taking you to table 54 and that he was our server, then corrected himself to say he's our host and if we needed anything we could grab them up front. He did not provide us with any silverware. May have been his first day, so didn't think too much of it.  Server came out and took our orders, when the food came out, it was missing our sides.  Then we had to ask for refills and when refills came out, the old glasses were left on the table. There were 4 of us, so by the end of our meal we had about 8-10 glasses on the table.  Overall, horrible experience long wait time to receive food and refills, and the food was below average in taste. I will never return to this location and probably won't be eating at Fridays ever again period..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
B Y.,"Springfield, VA",4,168,4,2.0,11/11/2015,"Been here about 5 times now.  Overall the food seems to vary between barely okay to quite tasty.  The tasty tend to be the burgers and ribs, and anything that starts with ""Jack Daniels"". Steaks were overdone even when ordered rare. I think they go through waiters pretty quickly, because it seems like every one I've had was on his / her first day.   $3 martinis on Tuesdays are a good deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Gabriel G.,"Washington, DC",2,7,,2.0,7/23/2016,"Arrived for an early lunch today with a group of 7. Very unhappy with the food. One of the people at our table ordered a chicken caesar salad. The chicken was burnt, the lettuce was limp, and had a very bland taste. Another salad at our table was just smothered in dressing. Not very appetizing! Also, someone else ordered a burger and fries and a side of broccoli. The fries and broccoli had absolutely no taste. We left quite unsatisfied. In the words of my buddy, ""Never coming back; that's a fact. This might even be my last TGI Friday's experience.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Gladys D.,"Fairfax, VA",86,78,26,1.0,4/21/2016,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Ended up ordering carryout since this is the closest location. Once AGAIN, poor customer service. Ordered the food around 5:35PM, arrived to pick it up around 6:15PM but had to wait until 6:45PM. UNACCEPTABLE. Carryout should not be taking more than an hour, there seems to be no point in ordering ahead. There was almost no one eating there so I do not understand why it takes them so long to prepare. They only checked up on my food order once. After waiting for 30 minutes, we asked about our food and was told to go to the bar because it had been ready for a bit. Why weren't we informed that the food was ready? I have never had to go to the bar to get my food since this specific location brings out the food to the lobby which is where you pay. The food ended up being cold and it was missing two extra sides. The waitresses did not apologize which just shows their lack of training.   Ended up calling the manager to make a complaint. I was offered to comeback and get another order done. That would probably take another hour plus rush hour traffic so we decided to pick another food order up another day. The manager was great and apologized. At least management seems to try to make things right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Jayden D.,"Tazewell County, VA",2,62,51,3.0,7/10/2015,"Service was great thank you Ahzia.  Very attentive and pleasant.   Appetizer - we got the pretzels and cheese dip.  They we ok we ate them very dark on outside a few had a little burnt flavor. Husband had chicken and shrimp pasta was very good and would order it again. 6oz steak with mashed potatoes and wedge salad- Steak was good cooked correctly but could have been cut a little better for even cooking.  Mash was odd salty, instantish and didn't like the green onions on top--so 80s  I don't like the blue cheese dressing too thick and was that a lemon flavor?

Julia N.,"Charlottesville, VA",195,210,466,3.0,11/17/2013,"First off, kudos to our server because handling a party of at least 25 people is a task not easily done. Especially a rowdy one such as ourselves. We did make a reservation, but it still took 45 minutes to get seated. I didn't get my appetizer and entree until a good hour passed after we were seated. But you know, that's probably because our party was so huge.  Food is good, but nothing different or out of this world. People tend to come here for birthdays (which is what the event was for us) since the staff will come and perform a five second happy birthday tribute, give a free dessert, and be on their way. They should clean their tables and menus better though because everything I touched was sticky and disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Huggy Bear M.,"Burke, VA",109,9,1,1.0,2/25/2016,"This used to be a favorite dinner spot for my fiancée and I but with the recent staff turnover it has totally gone to shambles. The food is subpar, the staff is rude and the service is just awful. Our waitress, Cierra, not only got our order wrong TWICE, but never came back to check on us. It was an exercise in futility to order the endless appetizers since we had no service to refill them for us. I tried to give some feedback to the manager (after paying our bill AND still tipping) and she was more concerned with trying to appear ""cool"" to the staff and blew me off. I'm letting all my friends know how disappointing the experience was and it will be quite some time before I patronize a Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60

Joe D.,"Arlington, VA",5,15,,1.0,6/1/2017,"Well, I went back to this TGIF and had a drink and a bite to eat at the bar.  The place is still way too loud.  But now I have come to the conclusion that the customer service is horrendous.  The first time I went in, I asked the bartender to put the Nationals game (you know, the local baseball team?) on one of the half dozen tvs, which instead were showing either out of town games or non-sports.  She looked at me like I had two heads and completely ignored my request.  Another time I went in and the male bartender literally ignored me for a good ten minutes while he talked to his buddies.  There was another bartender but she mostly hung out in the back.  Finally, the guy comes over and when I ordered a beer, he tells me he needs my ID because he is a trainee bartender.  I was already p.o.ed and, given that I am many decades past 21 (and unfortunately, look it), that made me angrier.  I just walked out and won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Sara W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,2,,2.0,10/25/2016,2 stars for food only.  Never again at this location.  Service is awful.  Blamed it on having a larger table.  That should not mean waiting 30 min for an appetizer and 10 minutes for water.  We didn't get our first drinks till we asked the people bringing the food.  Terrible service ruined T.G.I.

Ashlee S.,"Brooklyn, NY",653,332,22,3.0,7/15/2013,"I used to think ""You've been to one Fridays, you've been to them all."" But that is wrong. Some are great for drinks, while others might have decent food and drinks.  For me, I never go to TGI Fridays for a fantastic meal. I go for some cheap drinks with friends (typically their idea) and to hangout. I walked into TGi Fridays in Springfield at 8pm. I had a drink and appetizer (the spinach dip). Both were on the HH menu. By 9pm as I was receiving my meal, it turned into a club atmosphere. There was a DJ and all. Mind you this was a Thursday night. It through me off. I remember appreciating ""Club Fridays"" in college but I wasn't expecting this tonight. Anywho, it ruined my night. Not too mention my turkey burger was disgusting. I've had great ones from Fridays, but this one was awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Michelle B.,"Annandale, VA",1,43,39,1.0,2/3/2015,"I wish there was a way I could put less than 1 star. The waitress I had was beyond rude. When she gave us our menus she came back almost immediately to take our order. I think I told her 3 times that I needed more time before I was ready to order. My boyfriend ordered a steak and an alcoholic drink. I had the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta, it was good just typical tgi Fridays food. The reason I'm rating so low is because when my boyfriend got his drink I took a sip of it and as soon and the waitress saw she rushes over and demands to see an ID. I didn't have one and I do understand her asking for one but throughout the rest of the meal she was literally watching our table. It was extremely uncomfortable, every time I looked at her we made eye contact. She came to our table to ask if everything was okay way more than normal and way more than she was asking any of the other tables. Extremely uncomfortable.  Another reason I don't like this Friday's, one time I came here and when I came in there were like 4 waiters and waitresses just joking around and talking. They didn't even acknowledge that we came in. I asked them for a booth and they told me there were none available even though I could see some from where I was and when I asked for an estimated wait time they were unable to tell me one.  I will not be returning to this Friday's even though it is much closer to my house than all the other ones. The one in Alexandria is much better. The staff is much nicer as well. It's a shame, will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=60
Rh C.,"Alexandria, VA",0,19,,1.0,3/24/2016,"I used to go here about once every two months.  There are many, many restuarants in the area.  Our last visit solidified that I will never return. We walked in, noticed 8-10 tables by the windows were vacant except for two that were occupied.  We requested a table by the window to enjoy the sunlight and nice day rather than sit at the other tables in the dark.  The hostess informed us that a table of five was waiting ahead of us.  OK, no problem.  She said it would be at least a 15 minute wait.  What? A 15 minute wait for open tables?  The hostess explained that the waitress could only take care of two tables at a time!  I looked at the waitress and recognized her from previous visits.  I asked again about seating.  She said we could sit in the bar or in the back of the restaurant (it is always dark in there) right away but we'd have to wait for the 5 people ahead of us to be seated before we could and it would be at least 15 minutes. Really?  You turn customers away because your waitress only wants two tables at a time?  Other wait staff can't cover the area?  Thank you! Good bye.  We went to Bertucci's down the street.

So, I have come here a few times while visiting the Springfield mall & each time was, hmmm how do you say, ""okay"". This TGIF is decent sized but it seems that every time I come, they are low on staff, which makes the patrons dining here suffer because there are long waits at a time for drinks, food, or additional items you may need during your meal.  Now, I don't blame the wait staff, they try very hard to attend to everyone's needs, but I blame management. Why are you guys consistently having one waiter on staff for 10 tables? Wth!!! Ugh! Do something about it!  The food is great! Never had any issues. It's fresh, hot, & tastes amazing! The drinks here are kinda watered down which sucks because if I taste a strong, premium, speciality cocktail at five other TGIFs, I should not come here to order the same drink but in water form. No dice!  All in all, great location! Great environment during the games. The employees are also very friendly & nice!  Favs: The food & bar environment!

When we arrived, the hostess was on the house phone and asked us to wait by putting up her finger...we did for about a minute and decided to move to the bar area where we sat in a booth.  I retrieved menus from the bartender and sat down, but realized that although the table was bussed, it was not wiped down thoroughly because it was sticky.  We got up and moved to a table in the dining area after being seated by another host.  We waited for approximately ten minutes before our waiter arrived and we placed our order...about fifteen more minutes before my draft beer was served; and another fifteen to twenty minutes after my beer arrived, our food arrived.  Great...unfortunately, we did not have our eating utensils so I got up and grabbed a few sets from close to the front door.  Our server came by to ask how our meal was doing, even before we took a bite from our delicious burgers.  As we were taking our last bites of our tasty and juicy burgers, the bill arrived.  It was about the early thing that was quick.

Are drinks came out slow and they passed the blame on a missing bartender that day. Just our luck. Despite these drawbacks, the company I was with warrants the extra star so really, it was a 2 star experience. One more really good thing our friendly waitress did do for us is honor our Groupon.

Kris M.,"DeFuniak Springs, FL",4,51,195,3.0,8/21/2016,We are usually lucky enough to get the same server who is awesome! She deserves 5 stars on her own. The reason TGIF is only getting 3 stars from me is greed and greed alone. I always used to get the house Mojito with tequila instead of rum and it was $9. It was like this for over a year that we frequented here. Now for some reason they decided to still charge the $9 for the Mojito but tack on another $8 for bottom shelf tequila to substitute the rum. Who in their right mind would willingly pay $17 for a mediocre Mojito? I did not know they changed the policy until I got the bill and almost crapped my pants when I saw $34 for two Mojitos. Needless to say I will never get a Mojito from this TGIF again. The food however was still pretty good and our server was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=20

Anne O.,"Burke, VA",392,112,186,2.0,4/18/2016,"I went here with my friend to partake in the Endless Apps promotion. The first problem here was that it was 5:00 on a SUNDAY (kind of early for dinner but we were in the neighborhood) and the place was packed. It took our server a good 15-20 minutes to come and take our drink orders. She apologetically told us that they were understaffed and experiencing a huge rush in parties over 5. I even noticed the hostess bringing drink orders and helping much to the annoyance of people waiting to be seated. I saw our waitress maybe 10 tens tops during the night, each time she apologized profusely for overlooking us. Between each order of appetizers it took about 35 minutes making this a LOOOOONG experience. We ordered the appetizers and got the first batch: buffalo boneless wings and BBQ flatbread. The wings were okay but nothing to write home about because they tasted more like breading than chicken. The BBQ flatbread was good, if not a little messy from over-saucing. The second round: crispy green beans and potstickers. The green beans were served at molten temperature but delicious and the potstickers tasted like any non-Chinese person made potsticker I have ever had. Third round, mozzarella sticks and loaded potato skins: these are arguably the more famous appetizers on their menu and both underwhelmed. The mozzarella had bubbled out of half of the sticks while frying leaving a hollow skin of breading shaped like a cheese stick. The potato skins were almost all potato and no topping leaving a gummy-bland taste. Overall, I haven't been to a TGIF's before this for two years and I don't have a want to go back after this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=80
Diana J.,"Fort Washington, MD",153,80,65,2.0,7/21/2015,"OK, so let me start by saying that this was a family reunion dinner (for a small portion of the family)... a few of us wanted to enjoy our last night, before everyone left to go home, with a nice drink & dinner so we figured since it wasn't many of us we could do one of the local restaurants, especially since it wasn't busy around that area & at that time we arrived to put in the request.  The food was pretty good & the waitress' service, once we were seated, was awesome!  The waitress was very attentive to our group & always kept a smile & good attitude even though she had a huge party (us) to tend to; which unfortunately caused our drinks & food a long time to arrive. I'm only giving this 2 stars because when we first arrived we asked if we could get a table top for 20 guests... the host stated we could but it would be a wait (about 20-30min), so we said that's fine since all of the party wasn't there yet.  Once the entire party was there we went in to advise and also to see how much longer of a wait it would be (since we had already been there about 40min)... the host then told us that we would have to wait until the other group (where they planned to seat us) leaves before we can be seated, and since they had just been served their desserts the wait will probably be another 20min.  I was pretty upset at this point (because they had plenty tables open that they could of pieced together, why did we have to wait on a specific table to get up?!?!?!!), but I kept my cool.  As we sat there (in the front of the restaurant; inside & outside), watching all of these customers walk in and get seated (after we were told to wait an additional 20min) I was done!  So I went back in to express my disapproval/concern & also to see what the deal was because it had been over an hour & a half at this point, that they put us on ""pause""; that's when they realized they were wrong & told us that they have the table ready so we can come in now and be seated.  My whole thing was if they had told us UPFRONT that it would have taken that long for us to get that table top we would have had the option to either stay and wait, make a change to the request or leave and find a different restaurant all together!!!  That was a piss poor judgment/move & made it so I (and probably some of my other family members) will never frequent this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=80

All we got was the Cobb salad(is that supposed to have a hard boiled egg? Mine didn't), and the French dip. The kids ordered the kid sliders and mac and cheese.

Bingo!  This might not be bad.  We arrived on a Friday night going on 7 and were told a 15-20 minute wait, not awful, but less than ten minutes later we were shown to our booth. Nice! Booth was comfortable. Lately most booths I've been in have miles of space between bench and table and I end up perched uncomfortably on the edge of my seat to reach my food, this booth was nicely spaced. Waitress arrived promptly, took our drinks order and as we told her we were ready to order, our meal order as well. Husband ordered off the Right Portion Right Price menu so his meal was under 750 cal. Dragonfire Chicken with Jasmine Rice Pilaf and Broccoli. He said it was quite nice with a good balance of spicy (Kung Pao sauce) and sweet (fruit pieces). The broccoli was nicely cooked, bright green and still crisp like he prefers. I ordered flat iron steak (300 cal) with the langostino lobster topping (270 cal), mashed potatoes (my splurge at 210 cal) and mozzarella and tomato salad (90). The mozzarella and tomato salad is probably better in the summer but everything else was delicious and nicely portioned.  If you are watching what you eat a look at their nutrition info online first, or on your smartphone if you're already there, is a good idea as most of the menu is over the top high in calories, even items you may think of as good choices. But armed with some info it's not hard to eat well here. DJ came on while we were there, a bit loud for us, but we aren't the demographic they're aiming for (Get off my lawn!)

Rick G.,"Phoenix, AZ",999,396,11390,4.0,11/25/2013,"This is definitely one of the national chains I refer to often in my reviews that frequently causes me to cringe.  Although not the avid fan of the box-sets, I do give them opportunities to redeem themselves and often relegate error and quality to the 'human factors'.  Thus, my wife and I recently decided to give them a chance at culinary redemption.  Surprise, surprise, surprise... they redecorated this place (until not to recently, in bad need of an update) - apparently about six months prior to our visit... nice job, although some of the cheap work and corner cutting is pretty obvious with over-sprayed ceiling vents and booth divider panels with recent paint already peeling!  Otherwise, the place is much brighter, roomier and the acoustics and amenities vastly improved.  We also marveled at their new and improved menu with more variety, and apparently quality offerings!  Our server was also very good, Chyna is warm and charming in her presentation, attention to detail and service excelled - although we don't blame her for pushing the promotions management has driven her to push.  Since we'd already had our heart set on sandwiches, we decided to try their sandwich and burger selections.  I had the extremely flavorful, messy and juicy Philly Stacked Burger: with braised shredded beef, mozzarella, Asiago & parmesan cheeses, roasted cremini mushrooms, spicy giarinera & green onions, with Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, (w/o horseradish spread), onion bacon jam and peppered bacon (just slightly over-peppered), these ingredients worked really well together, the only other burger better locally (as far as I'm concerned) is Austin Grill's 'Hangover Burger';  plus started out with the Broccoli Cheese Soup: with American and Cheddar Cheeses, pretty good except if I hadn't added salt and pepper, it wouldn't have been; my wife had the tasty and well prepared California Club Sandwich: with turkey breast, apple wood-smoked bacon, ham and Monterey Jack cheeses on toasted freshly baked baguette and romaine lettuce, tomatoes, (although they were a little stingy on the) avocado and mayo along with sweet potato fries.  We washed our meal down with Ice Tea and a Hot Earl Gray Tea.  I must say kudos to corporate for the improvement which makes me say something I usually don't say about chains - we'll be back.  Thank God it's a new Fridays!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6?start=100

However, he continues to defend her and tells me I do not know the whole story. One thing I do not want to know the story NOR I want to witness someone belittling anyone.

What I don't enjoy is being fooled , tricked or lied to folks. Now,  we all have kitchens do we not ? Is cutting a steak into cubes for a skewar difficult ? No it is not, nor is putting veggies on said skewar. Sooooo, if you have steak and a skewar how do you run out of steak on a skewar ? Well, seems at 6pm .... this Fridays is fresh out. I offered to pay extra and to wait for the skewar, but no joy . This lack of imagination or can do attitude is why I do not like the service here. I can plainly see the bar drinks are where the money and attention is and not my to go order. Mortons and Ruth will make anything for u if they have the ingredients and you have time. Seems Fridays just does not give a darn and takes the easy way out while reaching for the low hanging booze fruit customer in their business model. So,  next time massive cut some steak and put it on a skewar if u would like my business please ?

The walls have built up grim and food splatter.   The customer service is horrible.  My father asked that his food be taken back because it was not cooked all the way.  He didnt say anything just took it back. When he brought it back, he still didnt say anything. Not a word!  When he brought the check, it was $160! We were a group of 7 people and the majority of us got the 2 for $10 and we only had soft drinks.  The receipt that he gave us was not itemized, which was unusual. The items read: food, tax, and tip (he added 18% eventhough we did not have 8 people).   We told him that we think something was wrong with our receipt. He explained to us that because we used a coupon for a free app, they could not give us the 2 for $10.  He was very rude and said that there was nothing that he could do about it.  When we asked to see the manager, he came back with a receipt that had the correct amount on it with no tip, this time.  We asked to see the manager again and he asked ""Why? its correct."" We said again we wanted to see a manager and he said ""Oh my god"" and walked away.   When the manager came, he was just as rude as the waitor. He told us to ""stop talking so that he could explain.""  Really?!? He then told us the exact same that thing the waitor said and was talking to us as if were idiots.  He just kept defending the waitor, instead of realizing what the problem was. He clearly did not know how to be a manager! If the waitor would have told us in the begining that we could not use a coupon with the 2 for $10 deal, there would have not been a problem.

Terry J.,"Reston, VA",25,126,191,3.0,5/22/2011,"$40 for two tall beers, half rack of baby back ribs, deep fried green bean appetizer, roasted chicken salad and Oreo dessert. It has been over 20 years since I last visited a T.G.I. Friday's: so sub-optimal was the last visit. My wife and I stopped for a late dinner after taking a night-time walk on the National Mall in DC visiting several monuments.  After the three hour walking we were hungry and thirsty.  Where to eat at 11:30 pm? We yelp'd up T.G.I. Friday's near the Franconia-Springfield metro stop and the ratings were okay and they were open, so gave them a try. The beers were delivered FAST.  I mean F A S T!  Which was a good thing. The appetizer was green beans dredged in a panko-like batter and deep fried and served with a horseradish infused dipping sauce.  It was much better than I expected.  I'd order it again. My baby back ribs were meaty and fall-off-the bone tender and served with extra sauce, a ginger slaw and french fries.  Very good. My wife's chicken salad included a generous helping of roasted chicken, big hunks of avocado all served over a very generous helping of greens.  She liked it a lot. The Oreo dessert was something that looked like it was prepared at some giant factory somewhere and shipped out pre-frozen.  Two oversized cookies filled with soft serve ice cream.  Boring... On the down side the place is very, very noisy.  If you sit in the bar you'll leave with a headache.  We took a table away from the bar where it was still noisy but we could at least talk to one another. Overall:  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and rapidity of service.  While I am not likely to add this place to my ""must visit"" list: I am now less likely to dismiss the brand when I am searching for someplace to eat late at night.

We had waited so long for our food at that point we just ate and by the time the server actually came by to check on us we just let him know what happened with his meal. He offered to comp his meal which was nice of him, we didn't ask for that or expect it but he did. When he came back he didn't say a word just handed us the bill and when my husband gave him his card for payment and he came back with the slip to sign again he said nothing. No have a good night, sorry for the delay or the mistake nothing. He acted so rudely toward us as though we had thrown a fit at him or something.

I complained to the manager about the hostess and he didn't really seem like he cared, he just pretty much said ""oh well if you're sitting at the bar, then you don't need to be seated"" That wasn't really the point, but ok?

Preti N.,"Houston, TX",0,4,4,1.0,1/28/2017,"Utterly the worst situation I have been in. The most incompetent pair of bartenders I've seen in any restaurant. They don't even acknowledge ANYONE who sits down at the bar. If you get to actually order your food it is auctioned off as if it's a free raffle. And then everyone gets to breath all over it because whoever runs the food out they leave it in front of anyone. Other people joking around saying it's theirs, then finally one bartender will remember who ordered it and by time they get it it's probably cool. Not like anyone cares if you like your food or not because no one checks to see.  If you do need anything sauce, napkin, your food hopefully another guest will see you trying to get the bartenders attention and maybe just maybe they can get them for you. And just maybe you can get everything you need to FINALLY eat your meal. Oh no maybe not because someone else's meal is all over you silverware. Come the F on!!# Really!!##&€*/? I ask for plasticware just to enjoy my Mac and cheese, but great there is no cheese just oil and noodles oh a little bit of cheese that is dried on. Dont make excuses for that either. I have had that same Mac n cheese at the kings street location and it was good. Could you have at lease tried to make it eatable.  Seriously you all should be ashamed at your service. Corporate should just let everyone of you go and start some fresh hiring. Its so sad that that is how you treat anyone.

Malik J.,"Clinton, MD",340,36,132,2.0,12/25/2015,"Please, grab your reading glasses and something strong to drink for I have a story to tell you.  Setting the mood: The sky was dark and filled with stars, and it was Christmas Eve. We were already out and about trying to finish up some last minute shopping.  We called ahead to TGIF to make sure that the place is still open. They didn't close until 8:00pm, so we decided to head there and eat dinner. Of course we are filled with holiday cheer and joy because its Christmas time. So, we walk in and one of the hosts begins to take us to our seats. We ask to be seated in a booth section and she says okay thats not a problem, BUT! I just so happened to have turned around to see the other folks that were also having dinner. The other host was giving us an evil look, the kind of look where someone cuts their eyes to the conner of their eye sockets wanting to say something. We brushed it off though. We get to our booth and long story short, throughout the whole meal I am seeing this woman give my girl looks all night long. My girl is the one who asked for our seats to be changed, so I figured it had something to do with that. Not 100% sure, but thats just what I gathered from what was going on. Never said anything to her though, because it was Christmas time and we were in a good mood just being with each other. My reason for sharing this with you, Ive read a few reviews where people have encountered problems as well at this very same location. Other than that, its time for the food review. The food wasn't bad, not a big TGIF fan, the food is okay at best. The wings I had last night were pretty good, I believe they were flavored with Memphis BBQ. I must say, I actually enjoyed that. Id order it again whenever we go back, it taste better than the Jack Daniels wings to me. Their Strawberry Lemonade was pretty good too. Im very big on lemonade, so I always order lemonade wherever I go.

Jessica E.,"Franconia, VA",126,69,411,3.0,1/13/2018,"We headed to TGI Fridays yesterday for a late dinner because well, thank God it was Friday! The parking lot was packed but we were still able to be seated right away. We sat down at about 8:30pm. I noticed that it was extremely loud. They were pretty busy, because it took our server about 10 minutes to come by, say hello, and get our drink orders.  I do want to say that she wasn't bad. She was extremely nice, just not the most attentive. We would go long stretches without seeing her, while we waited for a century for our drinks and food to arrive. A big pet peeve of mine is getting my drink order at the same time as my food. I was worried this was going to happen, but luckily (sort of?) the food took even longer than expected so I could enjoy my drink and even order a second one lol. No judgements! This was all before our food came out.   A half hour later, we got our drinks. And THEN our food came at 9:20pm, with my second drink. We were there for FOREVER! I had the Regal Apple Sangria and the Tito's Mule, while Jeff had the Seasonal Sam Adam's - Cold Snap. The Apple Sangria didn't wow me, but the Mule did! The lime and ginger beer cut the vodka perfectly! Besides the obnoxious wait time, the food was excellent. I ordered the Mac and Cheese Burger with a side of Chrispy Brussel Sprouts and Jeff just ordered from the appetizer menu, getting onion rings and sliders with a side of fries. My burger was cooked perfectly and the combination of the mac and cheese and bacon were heavenly. I liked how they prepared the mac and cheese to be in a sort of crust, to keep it all together while still being ooey and gooey.  The brussel sprouts were seasoned and dressed really well too. Balsamic goes so well with these!  So overall, I had a pretty good evening, but I think next time I'll just order out and avoid having to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6

That's a 50% increase, for those keeping score at home. They actually decreased the number of options on the app menu. The $15 price puts them on par with other buffets with WAY better options.

This restaurant has the most consistently bad customer service of any restaurant I have ever been to. Are you surprised I gave it two stars? Yes I'm surprised as well. But, the food was good and the Manager tried to save the day by being nice and offering a free desert coupon. But it's a little to late. What I should say is what food we got was good. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING WE ORDERED. Look at the picture of our receipt. You will see the appetizer $12.99 taken off our bill. That's because we never got it. But it didn't end with them losing just $12.99. When we go to TGI Friday's we always order an appetizer and have two drinks and then order our meal. Since our main course came out and we never got the appetizer, it cost them three drinks too. That's about $30. The waiter wasn't great either. I won't mention his name because I don't do that. But the last waiter we had at this restaurant was also lack luster. We didn't get pineapple or a cherry in our Lava Flow either. What's up with that? I will now only patronize the Tyson's Corner Center TGI Friday's. The difference is like night and day. You can't even really compare them that are so different.

I wanted to try the unlimited apps because I haven't eaten at Fridays in years and let's just say I'm going to totally keep it that way.  There unlimited app selections are terrible and they've changed. I feel like some items should be regional. I'm not going to lie and say that I've ever eaten fried pickles. But, I'm pretty sure that it's not for the DMV area.  Now, I sat at the bar...which was probably my first mistake. My bartender was decent....I ordered my first app. It was alright. I totally didn't finish it then I wanted to try another one. Obviously, I mean I did order unlimited apps. It took awhile for her to come back from the side are so it took awhile for this 2nd order.  I wanted to order a 3rd round of something different and it was during this time that she merely took my plates. And never asked if I wanted anything else. She proceeded to the back area and I saw her and another employee just talking and chatting it up.  Very odd and weird. It was during this time and I saw another bartender and I asked him to close me out.  Lesson of the story is be attentive especially when you have a fatty like me around.

Our server was very accommodating but the food could have come out faster. Been here many times and always left full and satisfied. The endless appetizers alone are worth the visit at just $10! You can choose from barbecue chicken flatbread , mozzarella sticks, boneless chicken wings  queso dip, and potstickers. I love the flatbread and mozzarella sticks the best but wings weren't bad either. The first order is a normal size and every order after that is half sized, I don't mind this because it prevents food waste and allows you to try different items. If you want a real treat get the mango lemonade it's one of the best drinks you'll ever have and free refills. I've had 3 in one sitting before!

Mariah S.,"Washington, DC",69,316,620,2.0,3/27/2017,"Came in today after 1pm for a late lunch. Not busy at all so why is the hostess taking her time to seat us? We were only 3. She also needs to smile and greet customers cheerfully which didn't happen. Her face was sullen and she moved with no energy to her.  In contrast, the food server was very pleasant. She offered us chips and salsa on the house while we were looking at the menu. Friday's has a not too extensive nor impressive lunch menu which is limited to sliders, chicken salad, and I think it was a quesadilla and maybe half a sandwich. It was a little odd to see how the main entrees did not come with sides. You have to purchase it separately. And the prices didn't seem to reflect a la cart since other similar chain restaurants like chilis, daves bbq, etc offer sides with their meals for the same price at Fridays.  Review of the following:  Combo appetizer-wings (6 pieces) fried mozzarella sticks (4 pieces) potato skins (4 pieces) and potstickers (4 pieces) - skins were a bit dry and chewy. Seemed like they and the sticks had been sitting under a heat lamp. The cheese was not gooey or hot just solid and temp was lukewarm. I ordered the garlic parm wings and was presented with wings that had buffalo sauce. I told the server and she apologized and made it right. Wings came back seasoned with a tasty buttery garlic sauce hot from the fryer. Kids meal - mac and cheese, mandarin oranges, chocolate milk. Good sized portion for a 12-yr-old. The server was attentive and helpful despite the kitchen goof.  They are running an appetizer promo $10 for select menu items. I would go back for the unlimited wings but not much else. Fridays was a big hit back in the day. It was fun to eat there and the food had more variety. This location low energy just like the hostess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6

Thankfully the servers aren't attired in the cheesy get-up anymore, but the food is just as I remembered.  Bland, uninspired, and taste like it was re-heated off a Sysco truck. My dining companion and I ordered a rack of ribs with TGI Friday's famous Jack Daniels sauce and a cheeseburger.  Pretty generic fare and I figured and hard to mess up....WRONG!  The ribs were so dry that pulling the meat from the bone caused it splinter into little pieces like peanut brittle.  But the cheeseburger was the worst part of the meal.   After a few bites, my friend immediately pulled out something dark from the hamburger patty.  It appeared to be a corner of the meat that was over cooked to the point that it was charred.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  Because the end of the patty was so hard and over cooked, it actually chipped her tooth! So lesson learned for me.  Even if Groupon is offering a $15 for $30 deal - just AVOID!   There is a reason TGI Friday's has to resort to gimmicks like unlimited appetizers or Groupons to drum up business - because their food is sub par and the decor is stuck in the 90's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6
Hailey A.,"Springfield, VA",4,58,6,1.0,10/28/2017,"If a restaurant can't cook a chicken dish correctly than it should really reconsider being a restaurant. They totally butchered my Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. The dish used to be so great, now it just tastes like pasta with cream and Texas Pete hot sauce poured on top of it, with the addition of rubbery chicken. I told my waitress and she said the chicken comes like that and it's all premade? Okay. Still not acceptable, we went around 6:30 not that busy YET! Seriously though, what happened to the quality of the food here? Will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6
Cal H.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",119,149,142,4.0,7/4/2017,"I was here on 6-18-2017.  My server was ""Tonja.""  She is amazing!!  If you ever go here, request her.  Food was good.  Service was great.  Although she was busy, she was attentive.  She knows what I like without me even having to ask/order.  I highly recommend her.  I will be back.  I'm also a member of your frequent eater program.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6
Deborah R.,"Falls Church, VA",34,4,,2.0,10/15/2017,Came to this TGIF because my family received a coupon in the mail. Service was mediocre and the food was terrible. The burger was completely dry and over cooked and my spouses meal did not come out correctly. We never received drink refills and the restaurant was nearly empty with a ton of servers. The servers attitude did improve when she brought the check though. Of course.... I won't be going back to any TGIF period. I haven't had a good experience at any location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6
Jenny T.,"Falls Church, VA",30,49,10,1.0,4/1/2017,I've lost hope with this chain. Service has gone downhill. I've had a waiter disappear in the middle of dinner prompting us to have to speak to the manager just so we could leave. We've waited at the front with no host/hostess and a waiter had to grab one from the back just so we could get seated. Some waiters are passable but most leave our drinks empty. The list goes on. No sure what happened but I can't keep trying to eat here. My SO and I have been going for 3 years and it has gotten worse with every visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-6
