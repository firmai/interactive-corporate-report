Mallory M.,"Manhattan, NY",5,77,10,4.0,11/24/2017,"CPK is one of my favorite chains. Although it is a chain restaurant, it is pretty consistent everywhere you go. I love the pizza, avocado club egg rolls, and lettuce wraps. Nothing super special about it; it's a nice place to eat with big groups. It's also pretty cheap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
Tom B.,"Round Rock, TX",74,233,10,2.0,8/14/2017,"First and last time at CPK. We walked in to a half empty restaurant and the hostess said there would be about a 10 minute wait for a table. Is there a bunch of tiny people I can't see sat at all the empty, clean tables? Anyway, we sat at the bar. We split the mac and cheese bites to start which were ok. They tasted like they had been defrosted though. We then split the garlic chicken pizza which they claim to be a favorite/specialty. Huge mistake on our part not realizing it was a white pizza which we don't like nearly as much as a ""normal"" pizza with tomato sauce. They had tried to be too fancy with their menu and didn't have that many traditional pizzas which we would have preferred anyway. I know that the pizza was at least cooked to order as we were sat right in front of the huge pizza oven, but it in no way tasted hot and fresh out of the oven. It was warm, not hot and felt like it was at least a day old and reheated. Perhaps the dough/base was, either way, it wasn't good and between us we couldn't finish 1 pizza and both felt a little sick for a couple of hours afterward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
Andrew C.,"Austin, TX",7,239,68,2.0,7/24/2017,"Service is good, but I've never liked the restaurant concept.  I'm a pizza purist - so weird pizzas aren't may thing.  As per usual chain type restaurants - the food is mostly just meh.

Joanna F.,"Anderson Arbor, TX",15,32,1,1.0,12/17/2017,Food was a bust. Pizza crust was burned. No menu or spices on tables. Domain location is much better.  Staff didn't seem to enjoy their job. I definitely won't be coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
Laura H.,"Austin, TX",96,106,173,4.0,4/22/2017,I do like CPK.  This one is near Nordstrom at Barton Creek. It looked pretty full to me the host was super sweet by putting me at a table. My waiter wasn't bad I just think he had a lot of tables & everyone was asking for a lot of stuff.  Anyhow I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. And the Sicilian pizza.  Both came out at a good time. I hate getting a appetizer and then the meal shows up.  It was spaced out enough.  I don't come here a lot because I feel the prices are a little higher for what we get. Will I be back ... yea I will ... overall great experience & good service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
Jennifer B.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,658,3821,4.0,6/17/2016,"This review is based on my experience from Taste of North Austin at The Domain: 6/11/2016.  ELEVENTH STOP: California Pizza Kitchen FOOD OFFERING: Arugula Salad I was super full at this point, but I didn't want to waste any of my food tabs, and this being the 11th stop, I had to choose something light. I felt conflicted about making a stop at this spot since I am from California and CPK is abundant where I'm from - not to mention I've been there way too many times...  ... but I needed something light, and this was as close as it's gonna get.  No regrets! The combination of the arugula leaves, quinoa, pine nuts and the dressing... WOW, I was impressed!!! I might have to go visit a CPK soon just to have this!  4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
Brad H.,"Garland, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/17/2017,"This was my first time at a California Pizza Kitchen and I was SEVERELY disappointed!!! Waitress didn't introduce herself. I still don't know her name. She didn't pay much attention to us, except to take our order and deliver it. My wife doesn't eat much, so after her first slice of pizza, she asked for a box.  Waitress brought another table their order, too another table's drink order, made it, took their food order, then took another table's order. As she was checking on us, I tried her we were still waiting for a box.   Meanwhile, I found someone else's pasta in my dish. Checked my daughter's pasta and she also had someone else's pasta in her dish.  By that time, I. Was. DONE!!!!!    But we still had to wait for a box and the check.  I may give another California Pizza Kitchen a try, but I won't go back here.  If this is their standard customer service, I'm amazed they are still in business.  Now for the food.  My wife's pizza had no sauce.  My pasta was bland and my daughter's pasta tasted badly.   IF, and it's a very big if, I do try another CPK, if the did is this bad, I will never go back to any of them.   Seriously, how is this place in business?!?!?  Do people really like bad customer service and blah food?!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
John F.,"Buda, TX",5,22,12,2.0,7/2/2017,This place is confused and does not know what it wants to be. Is it Asian Fusion or Italian? On top of the menu being extremely inconsistent my server was very inappropriate. She tried to hard almost. It took ten minutes for my drink to come out. After it came she told me how I needed to take a sip right then and there. She didn't bring me a copy of my itemized receipt. Once I asked it took about 8 minutes for her to get it. She was bossy and very pushy. Almost made us feel rushed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
Emily S.,"Austin, TX",9,38,1,5.0,1/2/2017,"Food is always good to me. Love their salads and pizza. But what really stood out to me today was the service. Michael, the manager was fantastic. The minute I sat down at the bar to order he checked in on me and took my order because I already knew what I wanted. He was friendly and efficient and I was able to see him hustling around in the kitchen, getting stuff done. It's clear he's a great manager and asset to CPK.  Food came out really fast, even though they were busy, so I was able to get back to my lunch hour shopping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin

Willy N.,"Houston, TX",206,125,105,4.0,2/14/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen is pretty consistent with their food and service. I have been to this location several times in the past, and their different pizza and pasta are always delicious and fresh.  On this visit, I actually had the California Club Chicken Sandwich, and it was great! The ciabatta bread was nice and crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The chicken was well seasoned and very flavorful. The bacon was perfectly crispy. The meal even comes with a side of bread and olive oil. Our waitress was also very friendly, and not at all overbearing.  You can never go wrong with CPK when you come to shop at Barton!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
Carmela S.,"New Orleans, LA",823,1039,3471,4.0,1/18/2016,"This place was hopping but, the bartop is first come first serve and luckily there was two seats open so, we snagged them.  The service here is a bit slow.  We had one server give us our drinks and tell us the gal would be right with us but, it took about ten minutes before we got the drinks and she said hi to us.  In her defense it was packed. I love the open air kitchen aspect and overall feel of being in a place that is quick service food but, the food doesn't taste pre-frozen. We ordered an appetizer and our salads and our salads came out first and we didn't think anything of it.  Then our entree came out that we ordered to share on the same plate when we asked to have it split and still no appetizer.  Our server noticed the problem of the non-split entree right away and took it away for the kitchen to correct it.  Then we told her we never got the appetizer and she asked the kitchen and came back and said it would be right out.  The expo guy (maybe manager) brought out our now split and separately plated entree and apologized.  No big deal and I appreciated him bringing it out and apologizing.  Our appetizer finally came out about 5 minutes later but, of course we were way too full to have more than one piece each.  They did comp it however, for the issue. Avocado Club Egg Rolls:  Very interesting in texture and flavor but, I did enjoy it overall.  The inside filling was hot but, not mooshy and I find that combo hard to achieve with avocado in the filing.  The sauce was five stars all the way. California Cobb (Half order with beets):  Their blue cheese dressing is out of this word delish.  The freshness of this salad can't be beat and it was so large that this could have probably been a meal in itself.  I will definitely come back for this. Kung Pao Spaghetti:  I actually didn't know what to expect since this is Asian/Italian fusion cuisine and who has ever really heard of that?  The peanuts and red chili are Asian so they worked well together but, the surprise came with them tasting oh my delicious on pasta with garlic.  Well done, well done. It took us waving down our server to be able to get some boxes and check out.  The overall service wasn't bad but slow and with the hiccups in steps of service to our food coming out; that's why I gave it a 4 and not a 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin
Jamie M.,"Austin, TX",116,10,2,4.0,5/26/2017,"We are frequent visitors of CPK Barton Creek and typically receive exceptional service BUT the last few weeks we've dined at CPK have been awful. I personally think it was due to the waitress and her inability to perform her job. The manager took care of us and here we are again for lunch.

Amanda H.,"Wilmette, IL",0,5,,2.0,7/1/2017,"We've been patrons for the last few years and the service has consistently declined. We dined last night in a half full restaurant. We were seated promptly, however, we waited 15 min before our server arrived to take our drink order. My drink was incorrect and took a while to find out server to let her know. We requested bread to munch on, which also took a while to be served. In fact, it came out a few minutes before our dinner order arrived. My order was also incorrect and it again took a longer than expected amount of time to find out server to let let know that I was given the wrong dish. She was apologetic and offered to have it replaced, however, my children had nearly finished their meals by the time she returned, so I declined. My children were happy with their meals, but overall was a disappointing experience, we poor service and incorrect orders.

Sheridan M.,"Austin, TX",0,10,1,1.0,9/1/2016,"I'm so disappointed in this place. I've been ordering take out from this location for awhile and I always get the same thing, a full Caesar salad with grilled shrimp. The past couple months I've noticed they changed the packaging of the salad and it's at least 2/3 smaller than the previous packaging. I never said anything but tonight I ordered the same salad and it seems even smaller, only slightly larger than a side salad...for $16. I posted a picture of the $16 salad too. I also ordered a cup of potato soup and the container was 2/3 full, so it was about 5 bites for $4.79.

Tim D.,"Halifax, Canada",74,516,123,2.0,5/4/2015,"Meh. Stopped in here because I was at a mall and couldn't take the food court. It was like any mall-busy sit-down family restaurant inside: bright and busy and loud. My pizza was pretty lacklustre. It reminded me of a supermarket pizza. The crust was neither crispy nor deep-dish, sort of in-between doughy. The toppings - I had their California Club special - had tasty ingredients (chicken, avocado, arugula, bacon) but they didn't integrate very well: maybe insufficient sauce or cheese?

Winthrop J. Q.,"San Marcos, TX",8,29,,4.0,1/6/2013,"I noticed a few of the reviews here were for the location in the Domain (north Austin) so let me establish at the outset this is for the location in Barton Creek Square Mall. I wanted to eat here from the first time I saw it, since I have eaten their line of frozen pizzas, because I was curious.  I always want to compare how the food in an actual restaurant compares to any grocery store marketed entrees I have sampled on occasion.  Some places have disappointed me, some have been real gems..  This place was one of the latter. I admit it wasn't a real auspicious beginning, because I had a wait time of about 15-20 minutes, but this was Saturday afternoon, and it was inside a popular mall, so i can afford to be a little overlooking on that point.  Got a table, and my wait after that was minimal on all accounts.  Immediately got an acknowlegement and drink from my server, Jamie, and he actually took a little time to recommend a few items and answer questions, despite the crowd.  I ordered a pizza margherita, since that is my favorite of their grocery line.  Fresh crust goes a long way to compare with frozen pizza crusts.  This stuff was T-H-I-N.  I like thin crust, but even I was impressed as to how thin it could actually be made.  It was good, maybe could have used a bit of garlic for my tastes, but otherwise it was good.  Topped it off with a dessert that caught my eye (because there was a picture of it on my table!) Salted Caramel Pudding.  It was great.  Overall a very good experience except for the wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=40

Roxy W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",155,444,1400,4.0,3/4/2012,"I always enjoy coming to CPK! CPK is very popular in Hawaii and I always come back because of their consistency, ambiance and reasonably priced entrees. This is the first time coming to this location and it looks like all the other CPK I've been to. My go to meal is the chicken salad sandwich on cheese focaccia bread with Caesar salad. I always get this entree because the price is great at $11 for a large sized sandwich and salad at a sit down restaurant. I usually eat half of my sandwich and safe the other half for later because it's a very filling sandwich. I use to get their Rosemary chicken sandwich but it has been discounted for a few years now. That was a better sandwich than the chicken salad sandwich.  There full sized salads and pizzas are delicious. I also enjoyed the fruity alcoholic drinks that were offered in Hawaii. I'm not sure if they offer a wide selection of fruity alcoholic drinks at this location. I have ordered pasta in the past and I would not recommend the pasta. The serving size is small, taste like crap and it cost extra if you want to add on meat in their pasta dishes averaging the cost of the pasta to around $15.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=40
Casey C.,"Austin, TX",7,5,,1.0,3/18/2014,Worst pizza I've ever had. It's not down home and greasy and it's not gourmet. Its some congealed cheese slapped onto a pizza crust with some old sauce in between. The ranch dressing for dipping tasted like it was out of date. The only redeeming quality was the drinks. And even then the strawberry margarita was more of a lightly alcoholic strawberry smoothie. I will not be returning here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=40
Diana W.,"Denver, CO",155,549,301,3.0,1/23/2011,"i know this is a chain but I expected so much more since I buy their frozen pizzas.  Our waiter was talking badly about the patron at his other tables with another waiter so that left a sour taste in my mouth.  I ordered the mushroom pizza and it wasn't that flavorful.  In their defense I did decide to put it on the new thin crust they offer there and most of the time the pizza is good cause of the chewy crust it's on.  My friend got the white pizza and it was just random globs of ricotta!! The whole pie wasn't covered with ricotta which is what it traditionally shoud be.  I ordered the delicious hummus and it was REALLY salty and savory...the pita bread pieces that came with it was so soft too!!

Kayte H.,"Austin, TX",45,37,,2.0,9/29/2010,"Maybe this is entirely my fault because I decided to order something other than pizza.  First off, when we walked in, there was no hostess. A pet peeve for me as I have worked in restaurants for around five years. When they did come up, they took us to the very back of the restaurant, which was empty except for a birthday party for a screaming six-year-old and ten of his equally excited friends. They said if it bothered us we could move one booth over. COOL. I'm sure that five feet would have made a huge difference. After waiting several minutes for a server to come up so I could ask to move tables, I gave up and walked back up to the front to ask to be moved. When we sat down at our new table, I saw a little flyer for some Korean BBQ Steak Tacos, which showed two tacos overflowing with steak and various vegetables next to a frosty beer. It seemed more reasonably priced than the other dishes, so I decided to order it. Thirty minutes later I am presented with my plate. I was literally speechless. I am not exaggerating here, the tortillas were the size of a drink coaster. I looked at the tacos, back to the flyer, to the tacos, the flyer....Apparently the beer next to these tacos must have been put in a thimble for it to be proportionally correct.  We also ordered a quesadilla to share, which was also about the same size. Perhaps had I been charged  99 cents as opposed to around six dollars per plate, I would have given this place a few extra stars.

Megan M.,"Austin, TX",190,216,14,4.0,11/18/2010,"If we're in the mall, and we're all hungry for a little something to eat, we'll typically head to California Pizza Kitchen because I'm just not much of a food court person. I like how it is a sit-down place inside the mall.  In recent times we've dined there (typically Sunday afternoons), we have never had to wait.  We are always promptly seated and have always had our drink orders taken right away. Sometimes the waiter/server person takes their time throughout the whole process- and there's been a few instances (with different servers, so it isn't limited to just one) where we've had to flag someone else down for a refill or the check. So what makes this a 4 star?  The food.  Super duper yum.  I also really love their whole ""Try something new"" policy where you can be adventurous and order something you've never had- and if you don't like it, you can still get your old favorite dish. My favorite I discovered is the Mushroom Ravioli.  Since I am pretty much a carnivore and expect some kind of meat at the meal, I decided to test it out- and boy was I not sorry.  You get to choose the sauce and I like the cream sauce.  Super yum! On the table for drinks usually sits the raspberry lemonade.  It doesn't sit there for very long and disappears quite suddenly. One thing that is disappointing is that they used to have fried calimari on their menu for an appetizer.  No longer- and it sucks because I miss it.  We're still looking for an appetizer to help replace it for us, but a large part of me wants it to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=40

Lenah K.,"New Braunfels, TX",75,220,33,3.0,4/13/2010,"Ate here last weekend with my husband and my mom.  I'm trying to decide between 3 and 4 stars ... I guess I'll say it was a-o-k.  My husband was meeting my mom and I at the mall after she and I shopped, so initially we had an incomplete party.  The restaurant looked pretty crowded, but the hostess still agreed to seat us without the third person in our party.  She also said it was fine for my mom to take her to-go cup of coffee in (shopping wears mom out!).  So that's cool.   A waiter showed up soon after mom and I were seated, and she and I ordered waters.  By the time the waters had arrived my husband joined us.  I ordered some sort of adult cherry limeade concoction to drink, which was good, though I wouldn't have wanted another since it was so sweet.  I was carded which I thought was a bit funny.  I'm 28 but I think that even teenagers are allowed to drink if their mothers are there and approving ....  Can't remember if my husband ordered soda or tea, and my mom stuck with water since she had brought in a coffee. We had a little trouble picking out an overpriced appetizer to share since we all had different desires, but finally decided to order 3 tortilla spring rolls (2 baja chicken and one thai chicken).  Mom and I both liked our baja chicken ones, and my husband thought his was just okay but loved the peanut sauce.   Ordering our pizzas was a bit bumpy.  We had decided on ordering ""The Works"" (a basic supreme-type pizza), and the california club.  We asked for the second pizza with no lettuce.  The waiter did not want us to get the california club pizza that way, saying that it would be too dry because the mayo the lettuce was tossed in was the only sauce on the pizza.  He seemed loathe to let us try it out (looking at their website I may understand ... it says that if you try something and don't like it they will replace it), or to have some other sauce added, and asked if we needed more time to make a decision.  We finally decided to order the bbq chicken with applewood smoked bacon pizza, sans onions, with avocado added.  The waiter told us that the avocado was an extra $2, which was fine. The wait on our pizzas wasn't that long, which was good.  Basically the plan was for my mother and husband to eat the ""works"" pizza, and my husband and I to eat the other one, but she wanted a piece of our bbq pizza so we ended up having less of it to take home than we did of the ""works"" pizza.  No problem really, I just didn't want any of the ""works"" because I don't want bell peppers or onions, and while bell peppers are easy to take off, onions are not since they blend in with pizza cheese.   Anyhow, I really liked the bbq chicken pizza ... the avocado (a large slice on every piece of pizza) went well with the sweet barbecue sauce, and the chicken was good quality.  The one piece of the bbq pizza that we took home was also still good the next day.  My husband and mom said they enjoyed the ""works"" pizza, and I'm assuming he liked the leftovers that he ate last night since he didn't say otherwise.   I'm sure we'll be back eventually, but maybe not for a couple of years since we don't go to the mall that often and usually don't plan on eating there. $60 is kind of a lot for mall food for 3 people, but then again, it did involve (small amounts of) alcohol and leftovers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=40

My first visit we ordered the one with the most cheese 5 Cheese w/ Garlic and Spinach I was in Cheese Heaven for about 20 minutes savoring every single bite I also had a glass of wine which made shopping much more enjoyable.

We would be having some serious problems if I was not getting my drink. I waited a little bit longer than normal for my food that night but maybe because I was starving and not to mention they kind of ""forgot we ordered appetizers."" It was nothing too extreme.  The environment on the inside of this place is dark like a fancy cafe shop. There are little lamps hanging from the celling to give it that dark bathroom glow. It is a pretty nice place, a little bit over casual for dinner time but nothing too dressy in terms of the dress code.  The dumplings appetizer that I got for $6.50 was extremely small.  (see picture in profile) The dumplings had the brown pho sauce laced over it and sesame seeds on top of that for I guess decoration purposes. Then, the entire dish was covered in green onions, which of course makes this dish totally Asian but not so much authentic from a Vietnamese girls' standards.  My dumplings were chewy which was awesome because it had the ""boiled dumplings effect"" but it was immediately ruined due to the fact that it was cold...""smooth operator...he is a smooth operator""... The menu was elaborate, containing pizzas, pasta, salads, and fried foods for appetizers. Everything on the menu ranges from about $7-16 from what I could remember.  I decided on ""the meat craver"" (sorry I think this is what it's called).  The toppings included ham, pepperoni, sausages, tomato sauce, and cheese. The pizza was $10 I think... My pizza..well there is picture of the pizza that I had that night with a friend in my profile. It is very small, personal size. The slices were cute little ones that had a lot of toppings. Then I realized I must have picked up the baby slice because the rest of the slices were average size.  A decent thin crust pizza, comparable to Austin's Pizza. However, this one has more toppings....for $10 bucks...uumm...I would hope so. My Dr. Pepper was $2.49...why was my Dr. Pepper $2.49....? Seriously...seriously...??  My total bill was $18. and that is without the tip. I tipped $4 bucks and my friend added $2 more so our total bill was really $24 for two. Their selections of drinks on the menu was awesome. I am a visual person when it comes to drinks and my eyes were in for a treat. I didn't drink that night, but I was tempted! I recommend this place to couples and groups.

We ordered the Jamaican jerk pizza and there was something off about it. It was bland and didn't taste as fresh. Our waitress was friendly and nice though. The reason why I'm also rating this establishment a one star is I had left an expensive scarf (cream colored with floral designs) and called and spoke to the host that night. She had told me she had found it after I had left and would hold onto it at the front. I wasn't able to get it the next day because I was out of town but came yesterday (Monday) and they didn't have it.  I spoke to the manager and she said she would contact me after talking with the host who was there Friday evening. I called today because I did not hear back and was told the host found my scarf and had it but had ""no idea what happened between Friday evening to Monday and it must have been misplaced or something."" She did apologize but I'm still a bit baffled as to what happened and how they could have lost an item they retrieved. From what I could tell, they had cabinets behind the host stand where they store items and it appears only employees can access and open it. Where else could it have gone?!  I hope that they can take better care of their customers belongings and return it to the respected owner.

The Sultan, a mysterious handsome man, asks you to sit, enjoy the music and partake of a strong, sweet wine and his antique hookah.  After some time, he beckons you to join him on a pile of silky pillows.   Later, as the sun sets below the sandy desert horizon, the Sultan claps his hands and beautiful servant girls bring trays of delicious food and place them before you.

I gotta say, maybe because it was close to closing time (not an excuse), the frozen is better. You'd think it was an hour old, considering the temperature, even though it ended up in front of me only 24 minutes after hitting the order button.  It just didn't seemed cooked all the way, as if it was rushed.  I'll throw it in the oven tomorrow and see if it's any better. I won't waste my time dealing with this place again, though.

Lily W.,"San Diego, CA",190,222,112,3.0,2/18/2014,"Once upon a time I was an angsty 14 year old who had never had CPK.... then one day, while wandering my former kingdom of Somerset Mall, my friends and I decided to try it and a lukewarm relationship began. CPK is one of those chain restaurants that I occasionally get cravings for and actually like. It's usually pretty decent food but I've never had my socks blown off. My favorite dish there actually isn't a pizza; it's the shrimp lettuce wraps. I'm a big fan of lettuce wraps in general but, as always, shrimp trumps chicken any day of the week.  When I was in college, CPK was one of the few restaurants in our nearby Briarwood mall. Consequently it began a popular place for students with cars to go eat. I've tried many an odd pizza at that CPK including their ill-advised creation: The Peking Duck Pizza. Yes, CPK once had a Peking Duck Pizza; there's a reason that hot mess isn't on the menu anymore.  I dropped by this location with a friend for our regular Friday lunch date and I was not blown away. Service has been slow the few times I've been here and this visit was no exception. It took forever for someone to take our drink orders and even longer to get our food orders. In addition the lettuce wraps came out literally 2 minutes before our pizzas did. That kind of defeats the purpose of an appetizer.  I ordered my usual pick: the Habanero Carnitas and he ordered the California Club. They both tasted normal along with the lettuce wraps. It definitely wasn't my best or worst experience at a CPK (there was an occasion when a server misplaced my order and brought out chicken lettuce wraps and INSISTED they were shrimp. I actually made one in front of her, took a bite, dropped the wrap back on my plate, and responded ""No, they're CHICKEN!""). I don't know of any other nearby CPKs so I guess I'm kind of left with this one.... slow service and all. Oh well, luckily I don't get shrimp lettuce wrap cravings too often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=20

Looking for some post-game carbs, I immediately steered the clan toward CPK and reserved a table for 10. It was a long wait; so long that murmurs of discontent could be heard drifting past my ears but I reassured them left and right that CPK would be worth the wait. How's that for foreshadowing?  After 45 minutes, our table was ready and we ordered hungrily. Right out of the gate our server seemed overwhelmed and I wanted to believe it was just us being hungry, but as drinks began to run dry and appetizers failed to appear it became clear that our server, and possibly their kitchen, were not up to the task. The manager visited our table twice and he gets credit for that but at one point I had to remove a non-food item from our food and take it quietly to the manager.

Anne Marie J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",208,216,69,1.0,12/27/2010,"I wish I could give negative stars. The hubs and I were hungry and wanted to avoid the overcrowded food court. We have been to CPK before. Nothing ever yelp-worthy but it's a place in the mall where you can sit and not go through a cattle line.  We sat down and ordered drinks. We started with hummus. Decent portion, we couldn't finish it. The hubs ordered the Pesto Cream Penne with chicken. He wasn't impressed but then again...its mall food. I got the Caper Piccata with Chicken...I meant Chicken Piccata. Not too bad. The lemon wasn't overpowering. There must have been a sale on capers though. The dish was covered.  Casual conversation and halfway though my fist cutlet, I cannot cut though with my fork like how I started out. Curious. I slice though with the knife and it's RAW! IT'S FREAKING RAW!  I thought I was going to meet my hummus again. Thoughts of e coli and salmonella and bird flu started flying though my head. I was eating slow so how much was already digested??? Is my insurance up to date??  The hubs brought it to the attention of the waitress who didn't seem shocked. She told the manager. He said he wasn't going to charge us for the dish and offered to make me something else. Uhhh, no. If it had been overcooked or too much salt then yes, please try again. However, when you give me RAW CHICKEN I don't exactly trust your kitchen.  I admit that I'm cheap and I search for deals but I'm not one of those people that seek out comps. I was completely ready to turn down the free meal the manager was about to offer as an apology for the RAW CHICKEN but again I was disappointed. Really?? I thought it was common practice to comp the meal when you try and kill your customers. We did eat the appetizer and the hubs did eat his dish so we wanted to pay for those. So thank you California Pizza Kitchen for not charging me for the RAW CHICKEN and the gastritis. Did you just seriously ask me if I saved room for dessert???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=60

Ambiance: It's a freaking chain, people. All sanitized and corporate... fake artsyness. Bleh. Food: The pizzas and salads I have had weren't that great ... I wouldn't get them again. Same with the spinach dip. Just don't get it and save yourself. The pasta is the best you'll get in the mall, and the avocado club egg rolls and tortilla spring rolls are quite tasty. Thai chicken tortilla spring rolls are the reason why I go to CPK. Price: So everything here is WAY WAY WAY overpriced for what you get. I could go to Louie's 106 for 1/2 price apps and get a better, and cheaper meal.  Bottom line? If you're at the mall and you need food/booze, CPK is the best of the mall joints (besides the Bistro at Nordstrom) for full on meals.

John B.,"Round Rock, TX",86,260,89,2.0,12/31/2008,"While out on a casual ""date night"" with my wife we were deciding if we wanted to go to PF Chang's or to CPK for dinner.  While sitting in the movie theater waiting for the picture to start I whipped out my iPhone and tried to check out the menus.  After reading the menu, and reading Yelp reviews, we decided to try CPK. Yes, it is a chain.  Get over it.  Not everywhere has to look like Magnolia Cafe or Kirby Lane Cafe. The interior was very nice, with warm brown, yellow, and dark orange colors.  It had a semi-open kitchen where you could see people working, but not really see what they were doing.  I'm a big guy and was a little uncomfortable in the booth we were seated in. The waitress was nice, competent, and attended to our needs.  She wasn't the best waitress I've ever had, but no where near the worst.  She was a little busy, and look flustered while walking around the restaurant, but when she was at the table she took a deep breath and appeared calm.  I've read other reviews about the good waitstaff at CPK, and they must have a good training program.  Lilli was nice and earned her 20%. The menu was almost too large, and it was hard to make a choice.  I settled on the fettuccine in garlic alfredo sauce, and I added grilled chicken and sauteed mushrooms.  The fettuccine was cooked properly, but the ""grilled"" chicken breast was rubbery, unseasoned, and didn't appear to have been grilled.  (it was totally white as if it had been boiled - no grill marks or taste)  The addition of sauteed mushrooms lacked any reasonable quantity of mushroom.  There were small mushroom slices that may have added up to one button mushroom.  The bowl of pasta was not hot when it arrived at the table.  (I don't know if this was because of the kitchen, or because my waitress who appeared flustered allowed the food to sit in the window too long.  Another member of the waitstaff delivered it.)  The sauce was too tight. All-in-all, it was disappointing.  I had a nice glass of wine, a pleasant environment, and my wife so it was a nice evening.  I didn't want to ruin that by complaining about the food.  I will write to CPK and let the Yelpers know if I receive any reply.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=60

Shane H.,"Orlando, FL",418,281,108,5.0,10/2/2007,"It is unfortunate that reviewers automatically close their minds when it comes to businesses in malls (or a number of other locations) and chains restaurants.  It is truly pathetic and shameful. California Pizza Kitchen is a chain restaurant located in Barton Creek Mall.  CPK uses some of the freshest ingredients and has some of the most unique and delicious recipes in the industry. From the interesting appetizers to the amazing salads, pizzas, sandwiches and pastas each is unique in it's own way and each is made from quality ingredients. Highlights on the menu include the Hummus, just about any of the salads, the BBQ pizza and the pastas.  Everything is made fresh as you order it.  Crisp lettuce, great dressings and sauces and everything is full of exciting flavors. The service here is top of the line, from management on down, they take great pride in their work and if you have any problems the manager will gladly address the situation and remedy it immediately.  It is nice to see a restaurant that takes so much pride in it's work and takes the time to pay attention to detail.  Being company owned and NOT franchise owned, these restaurants are consistent in their quality, their service and their food. So instead of making judgments based on the fact that a restaurant is in a mall or that it is a chain, I encourage people to judge the place on things that actually matter.  Like high quality food, great service and some of the best recipes in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-austin?start=80
