Rachel G.,"Uptown, Chicago, IL",6,3,,5.0,1/10/2018,I really love this place! The food is good and service too! I have tried some plates and my favorite is Nachos with chicken!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston
Cass K.,"Chicago, IL",6,67,136,3.0,10/23/2017,"don't get me wrong - i love chili's - i truly do, but i think most chili's are going to get a 3 star rating because the food isn't always that great. i'd honestly probably bump it up to a 3.5 if i was able to. i've been to this chili's multiple times, and i have to say this was the only time i was slightly disappointed in the quality of the food. i also came on a friday night, which i definitely have never done before! it was crowded. i did diverge from my typical path of a burger, and got the 10 oz sirloin steak that came with roasted corn on the cob and loaded mashed potatoes. i ordered my steak medium and it came very overdone. it was hard to eat and very chewy. i had trouble even cutting the steak; my bad for getting a steak from a chili's. the loaded mashed potatoes were plastic-y and very weird - it almost looked like they streched like those slime videos. my boyfriend got the ""honey-chipotle crispers and waffles."" the crispers were topped with applewood smoked bacon, jalapenos, and drizzled with ancho-chile ranch. my boyfriend said that the waffle was good, but everything else was pretty awful. the ancho-chile ranch sauce was tacky and tasted poor.  atmosphere is the usual; it was extremely crowded due to the day of the week [friday]. they seemed definitely understaffed, which isn't the servers faults. they were all very busy and running around. hopefully their management will help them by putting more people on the floor on a friday night! our server was very nice, but not very attentive because she was busy. i do like the ziosks because they allow you to order dessert and pay quickly without having to wait. overall, it's chili's. it doesn't have a bad reputation, but it is what it is. in the past i've gotten their tex-mex food which is always usually good, and also their burgers. if i go back, i'll avoid the steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston
Jonnathan J.,"Saint Louis, MO",80,106,219,5.0,3/19/2017,"This place is awesome! Tasty food, great portion and prices that won't break the bank. They have several promotions (usually for 2)... The last time I went there we had one of those that included appetizer (one), entrees (two), margaritas (two) which were amazing plus I refilled my glass like 2 times and dessert (one).  Honestly I can't remember the price exactly but I'm pretty sure it was less than $40. And we were soo full!. Really full!. Everything was fantastic (as every time we've been there).

The service was awful, they only had one poor guy waiting on 15 tables and we waited 30+ minutes to get the bill. The food is ok, I mean it's chilis for goodness sakes! The guacamole and chips were disappointing as were the fried cheese curds. The fried pickles were interesting but only to try, not really to eat.

Emily T.,"Skokie, IL",0,3,,1.0,11/19/2017,Usually love chilis and have no complaints but will definitely not be returning to the Evanston location. Just wanted to go for a simple appetizer but we waited for at least 15 minutes for a server. No one approached us we had to get the attention of another server who stated she would grab our server and then we continued to wait. Finally had enough and just left.

Raul T.,"Chicago, IL",40,58,,3.0,6/4/2017,"I frequent Chilis for an affordable, tasty meal with no pretention.  Sadly, I received nothing but pretention from a young group of high school girls when I was there.  The even had the nerve to pose for selfies in front of me when I was eating my Chili.  I just wanted to eat in peace!  The food was ok though.  The bottomless chips are a great deal.  Pro Tip:  Bring a empty tostitos bag and fill it with the chips to bring home.   Salsa can go in a Ziploc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston
Patty H.,"Evanston, IL",108,122,164,2.0,11/20/2016,"Scene: Friday evening, post movie. Not too crowded. My husband and I are seated in a booth. -- 5 minutes goes by -- A nearby server stops by our table and notifies us that our actual server is ""tied up"" and he'll get our drinks. (Thanks, friend!)    -- 15 minutes goes by (at a minimum, quite possibly more, we had to estimate based on the time stamp on a text I sent sometime after we got our drinks) -- We flag down the server who seems to be helping all the other tables in our section. Me: Excuse me, Hi, m'am. Are you our server? Server: No. (Blank stare.) Me: Um, okay. Do you know who is? Server: ... Me: Because, it has been a while and nobody has come by to take our order. Server: Oooh, yeah, I'm your server. No apologies. (As a former server, this is suuuper surprising to me.)  We try to be good sports and go ahead place our orders. We also ask for refills on the drinks that we emptied during our wait. Server completely disappears. When she returns with our food, we remind her about the drinks. Again, she disappears. Never checks on us, never brings the drinks. My husband thinks something is missing from his wimpy steak plate. He says it feels a little ""low carb"" to him, lol. We consult the menu and he is right -- the fries are missing. We'd love to let the server know, but again, she is nowhere to be found.  By this point, we're done with our food. It's not worth it to wait around for some fries to eat alone. We really just want to leave. We pay our bill (using the tablet at the tables, because -- surprise! -- waitress never actually came back!)  Sigh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston
Santiago P.,"Chicago, IL",9,12,10,3.0,2/20/2017,"Telling the client that it will cost $1.90 for the girl to play with the tablet is distasteful, they are ways u can charge it without being intrusive.

Ashli D.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",16,11,2,5.0,11/1/2016,"Sometimes you think a chain restaurant isn't as good as a bar-only place to have fun or watch a game, however this place is great! Great location, parking garage and street parking nearby, walkable from the train, great service, great food with there updated menu (only thing I'd appreciate that Chili's would do is add tofu to the menu - annoying vegetarian here) and fun atmosphere!

Sherwin C.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",535,924,13524,3.0,11/20/2015,"Average for a Chili's. Prices are alright, although a bit high if not ordering a special meal combo. Food tends to be a bit on the salty side and a bit oversauced but this typical of the dishes offered on the menu. Service is friendly, although the food does take a while to come out. Portion sizes are alright for the price, enough to be filling but not overly generous on higher priced items. An alright place to stop by if you want to watch some sports and have a drink but not really a good value for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston
Maria K.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Gross, overpriced food!! It used to be a reliable and fun chain and today I was served soggy lettuce drenched in disgusting dressing.

Tavi J.,"Chicago, IL",459,781,1664,5.0,10/6/2014,"As much as it saddens me to give 5 stars to a chain resturant....I must. I use to go to Chili's all the time until I moved downtown and started shunning chain resturants. This pass weekend I went out to the burbs to visit my mom and we ate at Chili's after seeing a movie and it definitely curb my hunger and was delicious.  I use to always order the Blackend Cajun Chicken sandwich, but notice it wasn't on the menu anymore (they were still willing to make it). I ended up going with the guacamole turkey burger and it was delicious. The guacomle tasted better than some Mexican resturants I go to and the turkey burger was cook perfectly. The season fries that come on the side is probably the number one reason I love Chilis. Finish up with a strawberry lemonaid and you have a perfect meal. I didn't save room for dessert, but the next time I go back that skillet cookie is calling my name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston

After I was seated, I waited & waited and no server came.  I had to request a server and someone came over, and was very apologetic about the absence of a server.

David G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/18/2016,"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Firstly, the service was unfriendly and bordered on rude. A friend of mine who mentioned a severe food allergy was given a dirty look by his server, delegitimizing his grave condition. Then, the food was vile and overpriced. Unless you are in a family or group where everybody likes very specific, very different foods, I could not understand why you would visit chilis. The tacos were gross, the hamburgers tasted like hockey pucks, and the flatbread was soggy. If you can't make any of these 3 very different foods right, why not focus on making one thing semi-edible? Our water was never refilled, and as the meal neared the 2 hour mark at this ""casual dining establishment,"" we finally received our checks.  This was where the meal hit its low point. In our party, half of the members received their checks, while the other half was told that the credit card machine had malfunctioned. Over the next 40 minutes, we were continually told that the machine was broken, without any consideration for the amount of time that it was taking to process the checks. We were not offered any water during this time, nor did we receive any type of discount or apology for their poor service.

On my most recent visit, my gluten free meal at Chili's was... chicken & green chile soup (still awesome!!!) oldtimer burger, no bun, no fries, extra lettuce/tomato/onion, sub mashed potatoes for fries.

If you see a movie at the theater just a few doors down and bring the ticket stub to Chili's, you get a free dessert!  I love a good deal, especially when it involves a Molten Lava Cake. They have great daily food specials and strong drinks.  And several TVs in the bar area for your sports-watching needs. Tyler was our server and did a really great job with us.  Half of us were hungover and we all just got out of Black Swan, so we were in a emotional tailspin because of that.  But he took care of our every wish quickly and completely.

Andy C.,"Cary, NC",84,413,913,5.0,6/3/2009,"If you are questioning why I'm giving this restaurant five stars when most of my food establishments have been rated a 4, the answer is somewhat simple.  I rate places based on what genres of food I think they should be in.  McDonald's and BK are in the same one.  Chinatown Chinese restaurants are in the same one.  Pizza joints are in another genre.  And Chili's - well, where does this fit in the grand scheme of things?  Americana?  Real food fast?  Not sure - but I group it together with places such as Applebees, TGIF, etc.  You get the picture. Part of my ""woohooo"" rating comes from the location of this place.  It's really convenient, and when I did my undergrad years in Evanston, a routine that I enjoyed was to eat at Chili's and go watch a movie.  Or...eat at Chili's, and watch 2 movies depending on what day it was.   Service is always speedy at this location.  I've done both the dine-in area and the bar area, and both offer fast service with dare I say - friendly waiters, waitresses, and bartenders. If you've seen the special on the Food Network that goes into detail about how restaurants like Chili's have such a consistent tasting menu nation-wide, you'll know how they do it.  All sauces, condiments, and foods come pre-portioned or come in containers by weight.  6 shrimp, two scoops of garlic butter emulsion, a package of veggies, some pasta, etc. gives you consistent seafood pasta.  It's not a surprise that they would do this, nor is this a particularly bad approach.   The drink specials at Chili's are also attractive.  When I lived in Evanston, I tended to go during the week, and they always had specials on their ""Presidente Margaritas.""  Yes, it has more filler than alcohol, but pricing isn't terrible.  Plus for a buck more, you can keep the shaker, which I did for my 21st birthday.  More often than not, I stick with their beer specials.  It's fairly easy to understand: 3 and 4 dollar regular sized drafts, and 4 and 5 dollar large sized drafts.  The regular sized drafts are more than sufficiently sized, but it's always nice to drink a couple of the larger ones when transportation home is pre-arranged. I recommend this place if you like a good amount of variety, decent specials, speedy service, and if you want to grab a bite before or after a movie at Century.  Skip it if you prefer your cognac warmed in a glass over a small flame and only want to eat at places that serve exotic fare.  (duh).  Now that I think about it though, I've never actually had a bowl of their chili.  Hrm.   The only other real complaint that I have is that they close at 10 or 11pm.  But bear in mind that they're restaurant first, then bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=60

In fact, you--little baby at the corner of Maple and Clark, you were my first time. I was 21, and honestly, I was scared. How could a $3 margarita be good? Hadn't I avoided you in suburban strip malls all my life? But you took my hand, Chili's, and told me, 'Hush, Child, and order the margarita. Get some chips and salsa while you're at it.' Perhaps it was the haze created by three straight classic margaritas (on the rocks, with salt) or the way my head swimmed after those spicy boneless buffalo wings, but that night, I fell in love. It wasn't all class, that's for sure, but you never pretended like that was what it was about. Instead, it was about American comfort food, inexpensive alcohol that tastes like spiked Kool-Aid in the best way possible, and--let's call it what it was--a good time between friends. When people didn't understand, or they laughed when I talked about you, I defended you. You can't change a man, and you can't change a chain restaurant either, I told them. You have to love them for exactly what they are.  And that's why over the last three years, I've come back to you over and over again. Whenever I need a cheap drink, a burger before a movie, or to recollect my college days, I need only visit Evanston and go back to our corner. Like an old friend, you're always there, doors open and big booths ready, tucking me in for another good night. And for that, Chili's in Evanston, I love you.

Here's why: It's become one of those place (not sure if this is good or bad) that I frequent quite often. Since I continue to go here on a semi-regular basis, I thought it deserved my 2 cents.  The reason I continue to go back? Skillet Queso...that's it! Chips, Salsa, and delicious queso. I will go there for lunch and simply eat basket after basket of chips. Their entrees are nothing to write home about and I've never in my life craved something off of their menu other than the Skillet Queso. Also, you might ask why a 3 star review for 1 dish? The answer to that is that it is an inexpensive option that serves up some decent margaritas (for only $3!) and they also have Dr. Pepper which happens to be my all-time favorite fountain drink. My advice to you is to save yourself some money on the tip and the entree you really didn't want in the first place and just get a skillet queso order to go and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=60

Tom R.,"Evanston, IL",66,75,4,1.0,2/11/2013,"I wouldn't say we go to Chili's a lot, but it's in the area and I could think of worse things to eat... That being said, I don't know that I'll be going back to Chili's for a while, in general after getting food poisoning after eating there this weekend.  Obviously I can't pinpoint if it was Chili's or not, but based on deductive reasoning, and the fact that I felt fine all day, ate at Chili's that night, ate nothing else afterwards, woke up at 3:30am and spent the rest of the early morning in the bathroom, I'm going to guess it was the Chili's. And honestly, I would have still given this Chili's a 2 or 3 rating, even with the food poisoning episode, but the service was absolutely terrible.  You know the service is bad when you make it a point to lower the tip down from 20% on the little touchscreen thingy at the table. I honestly don't remember the last time I've tipped less than 20% on even semi-decent service, but this was downright awful. I don't want to name any names, because that would be rude, but if you can avoid sitting in the bar, I would highly suggest it. First off, the bar was kind of crowded, so when a guy got up to leave his booth, we made sure we would be able to snag it. We had no problem with the fact that the table still had drinks and the check from the previous party on it, as we were the ones that snaked in and grabbed the booth out from under the previous party. Our waitress came by and said she'd be right over to clean up the table and take our drink orders, but after 5 full minutes of waiting, nobody had come by. The manager finally noticed that we were still sitting in filth and came over to wipe down the table. It wasn't until about 3 minutes later that our waitress came over to clean the table as well, even though it was already done.  She then took our drink orders, a diet coke and a captain and coke, and our order for chips and salsa. She came right back with the diet coke, but the captain and coke was nowhere to be found. Now I know that the alcohol orders all flow through the bar and the bartender was busy, so I'll give them that, but when I can see the bartender make my drink and set it out, I assume I'll be getting it soon.... I guess I shouldn't be so quick to make assumptions as it took probably another 10 minutes for someone to bring me that drink, AND IT WASN'T EVEN OUR WAITRESS! It was just another server who came up to get drinks for his own table, but decided to help the bartender clear out some of the drinks that were piling up there. It probably took another 20 minutes for our server to come back to take our food order.  Needless to say, as soon as she dropped the food order she got me another drink and dropped the check. We ate, paid at the touchscreen machine and left. I don't expect Chili's to have amazing service, but I also don't expect the service to be as shitty as it was. I'm surprised I even left as much of a tip as I did, but I hate being a dick when it comes to tipping so I was a bit on the generous side. It still wasn't 20% though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40
John D.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,12/26/2015,"Ate here many times before, but the last time was terrible. First, we were sat next to two tables when there were several tables open. So we moved ourselves over one table, which pissed the server and manager off. I caught them both eyeballing our table and talking out of the sides of their mouth--it was clear they were talking about us. We sensed animosity from our server ever since. Then, I was given a glass of water with red flakes floating in it. I didn't say anything to our aloof server about it and ordered a Coke instead. I ate three fourths of my entree only to discover a long black hair in my food. I told our server, Brenda, about this who insincerely apologized. We understood her poor service by the reaction of the apathetic manager, who came over to our table and flatly apologized. He couldn't even maintain eye contact with us when we were talking. It was clear he lacked the necessary training. He may have been new also. I don't know if the impending holiday threw their game off, or if they were simply having a bad day, but the service was horrible, and I won't be returning. I have always had to fight with my boyfriend to eat there because he hates Chili's, and now I'm totally turned off too. The manager took the entree off our bill, and gave us separate checks when we asked for one. They couldn't get one thing right! Good bye Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40
Daphne L.,"Evanston, IL",95,327,,3.0,2/12/2014,"Have I really not written a Chili's review? Really? Maybe there isn't much to say other than the food isn't bad, the service is decent, and, they have great drink specials. I meet a friend there for lunch about 1x a month, for their well-priced lunch specials that are even better w/our Wildcard discount. My only issue with this location is that the dinging room often looks like monkeys have run through, wreaking havoc and leaving behind dirty plates, cups, and napkins. Therefore, I only sit in the bar. They have a few outdoor spots in the summer, which is always nice for people watching. Not great, not horrible..fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40
Cassie S.,"Deerfield, IL",205,508,8,1.0,5/7/2012,"Yep, I'll admit it.  I sometimes go to Chilis, even in Evanston.  But I try not to (I prefer the one at Village Crossing).  I mean first off, there's obviously way better Mexican, Tex-Mex or any other kind of food in Evanston.  But also, they're just not a good location.  I don't mind Chili's once in a while, I just mind this location.  Service isn't great and the food wasn't even normal Chili's quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40
Melissa F.,"Chicago, IL",357,449,5,3.0,1/20/2010,"3 stars because 2 is too harsh, and 4 is too nice. Chili's is a chain that delivers the same thing every time. Their chips are weirdly thin - cost-cutting measures? I have no idea. Their fajitas are OK but sometimes too salty. A lot of my friends get their strawberry margaritas, which look like smoothies. Many Northwestern students come here for the margaritas and maybe graze on the standard-issue food. This shouldn't be too surprising...if it is, then I don't know what to tell you. Staff can be snippy. But when they're dealing with rowdy Northwestern students and their questionable IDs, I guess I can see what's going on - though better service never killed anyone.

Roxanne A.,"Evanston, IL",88,173,391,4.0,12/30/2013,"Before Buffalo Wild Wings, Bravo Cucina Italiana, and World of Beer, there was Chili's.  This place is our reliable restaurant if we want to have oh so bad for us but delicious meal without the pretension of some Evanston places.  It's located on the same block as the movie theatre so it's a great place to grab a bite to eat that will come relatively quick and still make it to the movie showing.  If you're driving in and seeing a movie, you can park in the parking garage across the street for free, since with validation at the movie theatre, you receive complimentary 4 hr parking, more than enough time for dinner and a movie, unless it's the Hobbit movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40

I just turned 21 earlier this year but was turned down anyways because I hadn't updated my ID. Although it wasn't set to expire until May, the manager chided me for not updating it ""so far past my birthday.""

Ryan H.,"Chicago, IL",5,24,,2.0,9/12/2011,"Chili's is usually good, but this one is not. Went there on a Sunday, around 6. It was really slow, something even the waitress commented on. I thought hey, that's cool, we'll get good service. Nope, it was almost impossible to be helped. First, they took mine and my dates IDs back to be verified by the manager. I am ok with making sure the IDs are real, but at least bring the manager to me as opposed to taking it from me. Second, the waitress was just plain bad. She checked on us once, and even after making eye contact with her she wouldn't come to our table. The food was also bad, which is odd for Chili's, as it usually is pretty good. I got the Hatch Chili burger, which was far too salty and tasted like it had tarter sauce on it. Very bad. Date had a veggie burger, and part of it was simply hard. Do they microwave them? Yech, come on. All in all, bad experience. 2 stars because I really still like the margaritas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40

Plenty F.,"Lombard, IL",16,98,10,4.0,1/23/2012,"4 stars. They lost a stars for the service being ""extra iffy"" sometimes. Other than that, this place is solid.  The location is great, and (if you sign up for emails) they often send out coupons that get you free stuff with your entree purchase. The salmon is wonderful.  The burgers are great and always cooked exactly how you order.  The hot wings are HOT!  The fries are well-seasoned.  The red velvet lava cake thing is pretty good, too.  Pass on the brownie sundae, unless you have a free coupon. Like I said, service is alright (at best) and the manager there is ""interesting"".  Super polite, but ugly at the same time and not very accomodating.  My twin sister calls it ""Nice-Nasty"". Anyway, good spot to catch a bite to eat before a movie  or an afternoon of shopping! If you are dining inside, use the kisok on the table to get your check.  It's pretty neat and super efficient - especially when you are trying to grab a good seat at the theatre. Funny thing, I've never tried the (singing) ""Chili's...baby back ribs....I want my baby back, baby back, baby back, baby back....""

Roseann M.,"Chicago, IL",122,454,94,3.0,10/30/2009,"So, Monday afternoon Mr. G. and I were planning to attend an event in the area, and we saw Chili's was close and open at 3:00pm. Not a lot of other choices in the area, and Mr. G. asked me, what was the last time I'd eaten at a Chili's? I told him, Bloomington, Indiana, in 2002. Somehow I did not have a great urge to return. We weren't looking for drinks in the afternoon, but we sat in the bar - it looked comfortable on a very wet afternoon. Way in the back of the menu I found ""healthy"" options, so I ordered a black bean burger. Mr. G. ordered a bacon cheeseburger with onion strips and french fries.  Now, I gotta say, we were pleased with the meal. Give Mr. G. a plate laden with cholesterol and beef, pretty much in any combination, and he's happy. He asked for it to be cooked well done, and it was.  My black bean burger was okay, not great, but hey, it was Chili's, right? And it came with a side of broccoli. Now, I am not a big fan of broccoli AT ALL, but I was game and tried it. And incredibly, it was good. We both ate heartily and were pleased with our selections. Now, the part that makes me give this only 3 stars . . . service. There was a waiter, and almost no customers. We did get our menus in a timely manner, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. But heck, i've worked in restaurants for more than 20 years, and this fella was lacking. Never got more water refills, had to hunt to ask for more napkins with our burgers (I learned a long time ago, always take extra napkins to customers who order burgers), never came by to see if we wanted anything else, couldn't find him to get a check - in short, he was just not interested. He probably wonders why he's not getting good tips, poor boy. The good part of this was, if I'm ever forced to go into a Chili's again, at least I know they have a black bean burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40

Ju L.,"Queens, NY",916,879,1194,4.0,7/7/2009,"I've only ever been to Chili's twice (both this location), and was not horribly impressed the first time, a year or two ago.  It was stupidly crowded, the service sucked, and the food was boring.   However, the last visit some weeks ago involved (aside from two people I very much prefer to the first group) a giant mango margarita for not very much cashmoneys ($3.50 on weekdays, for mango, raspberry, strawberry-mango, or strawberry-- The latter is not recommended).  If insanely sweet is not your thing, they have $3 regular (unflavored) margaritas on Mondays, either frozen or on the rocks.  Yay drink specials!  Our waitress was extremely friendly, despite the fact that we only ordered drinks + appetizer.  It's just a relaxing place to just sit and ingest stuff with friends while there's noise all around you.  And for its conduciveness to a good time if you're willing to have one: 4 stars.   Also of note, the salsa (of $3.50 bottomless chips and salsa) is basically water, but somehow extremely tasty.  I refrained from drinking it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40
