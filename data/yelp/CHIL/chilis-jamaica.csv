Nobbi L.,"Pismo Beach, CA",692,1062,371,3.0,8/16/2009,"This Chili's Too had a very server but she was totally understaffed. Playing hostess, server, cashier for eat-in and to-go. Poor thing.  Standerd Chili's too menu. Convenient location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,898,2.0,12/10/2014,"How I heard of this place: I had seen Chili's restaurants in the past years, even back in the Seattle area, but never made the effort to venture in. Our three-hour layover at JFK afforded us this opportunity, at my husband's suggestion. Type of cuisine: I always thought that Chili's was a Tex-Mex establishment, but the menu threw me off at first glance. The cover page complete with only the photograh of a large, juicy burger, boasting, ""Show Your Taste Buds Who's Boss"". Sandwiches, salads, burgersand  soups, chili, ribs, and tacos, quesadillas, fajitas, Chili's basically has it all. Ambiance: Terra cotta tiled floors, heafty, stone pillars, and a small gated area, creating a patio feel, look out onto JFKs Gate 11 in the terminal. The bar to our left, complete with big-screen televison and weary travelers, we found our seats at one of several tile-decorated high tables with stool seating. Other patrons found their seats at tables with chairs either inside the enclosed space, or just beyond the patio, where servers ran to and from the kitchen to settle orders and present food to diners. What I ordered: The Southern Smokehouse Burger ($13.99), a 2,290 calorie burger was topped with maple bacon, smoked cheddar, mayo, crispy onion strings and ancho-chile BBQ sauce, served with a side of fries, and a 220-calorie side house salad ($3.99 with any entree), with lettuce, tomato, red onions, carrots, cucumbers, shredded cheddar cheese and croutons with our choice of ranch dressing on the side. What I loved: The salad. Simple, light and refreshing after a long flight from Athens. Why I loved it: Quick. Simple. Easy. Cost: Average ($10-$20 per entree)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
Tom I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",148,1294,2012,2.0,1/4/2012,"Service was reasonable, waitress came to self seated table to take my order in 5min aft I sat. Food came 10min later.  Quality of food was simply awful - I had salad, what a disappointment. Iceberg looked very white / yellowish. 3 small ocs of Avocado  sitting  at corner looking sorry. Beacon prices were real but only little. No wonder they gave me a big dressing, because I had to wash down that crappy salad down my throat!  I'd not recommend salad here, maybe stick with something like burger?!  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
Adrian W.,"South Glastonbury, CT",218,284,93,3.0,5/4/2012,"Basic modified version of the regular menu, and it's really the only sit down option for food in this terminal. It was hot, filling and served pretty quickly. No complaints!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
Ron C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1384,1159,1998,2.0,4/23/2011,"We arrived at the airport and asked one of the TSA agents where to get some ""good"" food. She told us that there is a Chili's that way. We went in sat down and ordered. It took awhile for the food to arrive. Knowing that this is an airport and people need to be at gates on time. They should be a little bit faster. The selection was pretty good. I got the Chipotle Honey Chicken Strips and the Artichoke Spinach Dip. Both were good. The highlight of the meal was surprisingly the chips. The were lightly salted and went very well with the dip. After we left and went on to our terminal we saw A LOT of other sit down places. The food looked way more desirable than Chili's!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
Roxana B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,69,113,1.0,5/16/2013,"Service is horrible!!! Food is mediocre, don't bother with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
Marlon A.,"Manhattan, NY",113,239,337,2.0,4/22/2011,"Decent tequila selection. The service was incredibly sloooow....kind of a killer for an airport restaurant where people are in a hurry to catch their flights! The chips that come with the artichoke dip are really good though, so thin and lightly salted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
Marko T.,"Carmel, NY",214,35,12,1.0,6/14/2012,Stood there for 10 minutes and no one came to seat me.  I just walked away and had a better salad from Balducci.  Terminal 3 Delta,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
Cynthia M.,"Manhattan, NY",352,1225,25,3.0,1/17/2012,Decent meal if u wanna sit down and have a bite before your flight. We always eat here since we always take Delta from this terminal. Appetizer sampler gives you a bit of everything and the fajitas aren't bad either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
A.J. S.,"Houston, TX",4,5,1,1.0,6/27/2012,Worst service ever! Server was rude taking my order and she took 30 min just to give me the bill at the end. She had the nerve to tip herself when returning the change.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jamaica
