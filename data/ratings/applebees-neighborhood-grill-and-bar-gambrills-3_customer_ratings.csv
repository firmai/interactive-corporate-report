44,Stephanie M.,"Millersville, MD",10,138,28.0,3.0,2012-06-23,I agree with a previous post - I am disappointed that there are no Happy Hour Specials between 4-7.  Service last night was lacking - the waitress was too quick to bring the check without asking if we wanted more drinks or dessert. The place was pretty empty - especially for a Friday night so I'm not sure why she was rushing us.

Applebee's falls into the ""Americans will eat styrofoam peanuts if we deep-fry them and cover them with melted cheese"" school of cuisine.

What I got was McDonald's chicken nuggets covered in orange Kool-aid thickened with corn starch. On top of Uncle Ben's lemon-herb rice. It was absolutely putrid.

The sirloin may as well have been chewed up and spit back out. That's how appealing it was. I had two bites, one of which I DID chew up and spit back out. The veggies were old and mush. The mashed potatoes were edible. My boyfriend went for the 9oz. (Couldn't get through half of it.) He ended up munching on French fries.

They were over fried, so nice and dry and no flavor or that pow of peanut flavor you'd expect. Second I ordered a steak, which was a cheap cut that it was as light as pork even had the consistency of pork! Plus it tasted terrible and wasn't even cooked right. So I returned it and ordered a pecan crusted chicken salad which was good. Not the steak though my pregnancy cravings are screaming for...anyways. gave a gift card and cash to pay. The waitress actually rang in the cash FIRST then the gift card...wtf. I have waitressed and worked retail since I was 14 and know that you always ring up the gift card first!

I went last night and found the usual welcoming, fun, happy environment and elite staff but found a menu full of nothing I've grown to love over the years! When I questioned the waitress, she told me that certain locations had been used as test sites for new menus. Really?! I can can completely understand adding things, taking away things that aren't big money grabbers but a complete overhaul is ridiculous! Thanks to the great waitress, Brittany's help, patience and knowledge of the menu, I was finally able to find something but honestly if it hadn't been for her, I would have left and went somewhere else. Applebee's should pay more attention to the fact that they have great staff than whether or not the menu is being revamped otherwise long standing customers will walk right on out and hit the Olive Garden who changes things but still keeps the good old reliables that's brought them the customers who have returned for years.

The food is always good, nothing has ever been over cooked or left out (cold). It's disappointing that they've taken some things off the menu as they were my favorites (the original platter nachos and the blondie dessert have been greatly missed) but it's a chain so that tends to happen. This is a great location!  As a side note, shame on those of you who single people out BY NAME when giving negative reviews. I am absolutely against that. There are a few bad eggs from time to time but 9 times out of 10, misunderstandings/miscommunication are the cause of negative experiences and this can certainly happen very easily when it gets busy.

The place was empty but swarming full of employees with no customers to assist. With that being said my friend and I decided to sit at the bar and the bar area was dirty. The bartender cleaned up the glassware and wiped the bar with a napkin. Then with little to no excitement proceeded to assist us. As we waited on our food, I noticed employees were lodging around, eating food in different areas of the restaurant....in my opinion I know jobs are well needed but why have so many staff members there when obviously you are slow. The food was good no complaints there but if someone mentions Applebees I wont give this location another chance.

It took about fifteen minutes to seat us (not bad for a borderline large group) and everything went down hill from there. Service was very slow. When dinner finally arrived the two children were served last. How silly is that.  One medium rare steak came medium and one came rare. Ice tea ordered with no lemon came with lemon. The salad ordered with absolutely no mayonnaise came with a mayonnaise-based dressing and the included chicken was dry and tasteless. My baked potato was decidedly undercooked.

There were literally 10 servers standing around looking arounf aimlessly like it was thier first day. With all the extra waiters/servers around -- you would think service would be quick. The opposite occured. We waited well over 10 mins to get greeted at our table. Another 5-7 minutes for drinks (soda & water) to arrive. Spotty service -- even longer wait for our appetizer to arrive -- and 2 minutes after our app arrived -- here comes our meals ! I hate that!!!  Spotty service, average food, nothing special. I don't do chains -- especially something as low budget and basic as applebees -- but it sufficed. 2 stars off for spotty, slow service. Won't be back if I can help it !  Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gambrills-3,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

15,Jennifer S.,"Glen Burnie, MD",1,29,,5.0,2016-09-16,"I do not go to Applebee's often.  Usually the food is ok.  This Applebee's was fantastic.  I got the wood fired chicken breast with garlic green beans, and sweet potato fries.  It all was delicious.  So many restaurants can't grill a chicken breast correctly.  Not only was all of my food great, it looked pretty on the plate.  My husband was happy with his meal as well.  We had great service and hopefully we will go back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gambrills-3,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

1,Sharon C.,"Gambrills, MD",127,466,1661.0,3.0,2017-04-12,"My son picks this location for our talks and we'll go during happy hour to mix and match our options as we share plates. They have HH from 3-6p and again at 9p. Make sure you tell the wait staff that you'd like to be seated in the HH area for the appropriate pricing (half off apps and they have drink specials). There seems to be a rotation of wait staff and the managers on duty are very effective from my past experiences. On my last visit, I was informed that they are experiencing a Hennessy shortage. I'm like you're kidding right? She was not, there's actually a news story corroborating her statement. Who knew? Food is good, there can be some delays at times but they put forth an honest effort to maintain customer satisfaction. I'd visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gambrills-3,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

I went on a Friday night for happy hour and they have different food/drink specials along with a dj that comes on at 9pm spinning hip hop and r and b both old and new school.  The first drink I ordered I didn't like and the second one, which was the Sangria was watered down a bit.  Next time I will order a different drink and try some food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gambrills-3,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
9,Teara G.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,9,1.0,1.0,2017-05-04,This was the worst restaurant experience.  Burger was served raw when it was ordered well-done. Acknowledged it to the waitress (she took the plate without saying anything) had to track down the manager 15mins later just to find out what was going on. Staff was very friendly to each other but acted like the customers we're interrupting their party.

6,Janine M.,"Hanover, MD",124,18,36.0,4.0,2017-06-21,"Not the best Applebees, not the worst. Table kinda sticky. Daughter and I always stop on our day trips for what we call ""big salads."" The portions of salad we got are what used to be called ""half"" servings. The portion sizes for $11.99 were ridiculously small. Other places we've been aren't what they used to be, but haven't been THAT small. We were just very surprised. Served in a HUGE bowl, too. Hadn't been there in a few months but, wow, seems like an serious overnight shrinkage. Waiter was awesome. Forgot his name, dang. The BBQ sauce with the onion rings was just weird.  Nothing too interesting here. Sorry. #needmoresalad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gambrills-3,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
4,Valerie A.,"Alexandria, VA",0,10,2.0,3.0,2017-09-21,This a good happy hour place. The boneless wings were less of chicken and more breading. Not surprised so not disappointing. The bartender was great Markel (sp?) but it won't be my football watching spot on Thursdays. Not football atmosphere but you can't beat the happy hour prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gambrills-3,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
3,J P.,"Severna Park, MD",0,9,,2.0,2017-11-08,"I took my mother for dinner here tonight just about 3 hrs. ago and I hate to give negative reviews but we were both very disappointed! We both ordered the same item, Sirloin and Parmesan Shrimp which were a little steep imo for an 8oz sirloin and about 6 shrimp I'm guessing were sized at 30-36 per lbs. Shrimp were actually tasty but the steak was TERRIBLE! Hers and mine both were just completely laced with gristle making it pretty disgusting! I've actually been there quite often in the last year but there's no returning after the terrible cuts of sirloin we were served tonight! One plus was definitely the server, don't remember her name but she was great and her effort alone saved Applebees from a straight ZERO star review!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gambrills-3,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
0,Amber C.,"Washington, DC",214,105,163.0,5.0,2017-12-20,"Idk what it is but every time I come here I end up leaving really satisfied which is impressive for a chain restaurant. The service is USUALLY good and the food is always good. This is most likely the spot I come when everything else is closed, it's like I don't wanna cook and I'm hungry but I also don't want taco bell..... It also doesn't hurt that I can have a margarita or two with my food.  Half priced late night apps never get old and they even whip up special veggie quesadillas for my vegetarian self which is very much appreciated. My sister and I stopped in one night during october for the Dollar-rita special and contrary to what people said about them they were actually good! Plus you could even get flavored ones for a small upcharge.  Always a good option for late night eats in my book, until next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-gambrills-3,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
