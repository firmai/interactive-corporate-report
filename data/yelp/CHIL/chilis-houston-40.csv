Brittney J.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,2,2,5.0,9/17/2017,"Went Out For Dinner Tonight & I'd Must Say I Had A Really Awesome Time Here. I Was Immediately Greeted By A Host But Since I Was Alone I Decided To Sit At The Bar. the Bartender (Creesha) Greeted Me With Bright Smile & Full Of Energy! It Was An Awesome Happy Hour So I Ordered The Blueberry & Pineapple Margarita Which Was OUTSTANDING!!! I Ordered Chips & Guacamole As My Appetizer & The Guacamole Was So Fresh & Tasty!!! I Sat & Watched The Game In The Bar & Everyone Was Do Attentive!!! They Made Me feel Like I Was In There Home Apart Of There Family!! I Ordered A Sirloin 6oz Steak With A Fresco Salad!! The Steak Was Hot, Grilled To Perfection & And So Juicy!!! Two Managers (Tana & Jevan) Stopped By To Introduce Themselves & Made Sure Everything Was Going Great With My Visit!! I Ended Up Taking A Molten Cake Home Which Was Still Good After Warming It Up At Home! Today Was By Far The Best Experience I've Had In A Long Time!!! Thanks Chilis In Cypress Station!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40
John D.,"Harlingen, TX",27,1,,1.0,1/10/2018,Arrived and was greeted by the host. They said it would 30-40 minute wait. Looked around and they had areas sectioned off so I asked why it would be that long with all these tables open. Her response was that did have enough people to tend to those tables. We sat in the bar and the bar tender was all by herself tending the whole area. There was a female manager in purple shirt just walking around not even trying to assist with them being short handed. The female bar tender did a great job by herself with all she had to tend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40
Matt G.,"Houston, TX",23,50,61,2.0,5/23/2017,"When I arrived, my other party had already ordered the appetizer and their meals.  I immediately ordered an iced tea and requested a menu.  When I decided on my meal, a smothered burrito, we began chatting about the evening's event. It took over 45 minutes for the appetizer (Texas cheese fries) to come out.  Just prior to the fries being served, the manager approached the table to assure my party that the fries would be there soon and would not be served with the entrees, a pet peeve of my party. Other than not receiving my salsa as ordered until we tracked down a food runner and requested it again, the rest of the meal was uneventful.  The food all tasted fine.  Drink refills were done timely.  The server, Tiffany, checked on us regularly during the meal.  And although service was initially VERY slow, I still left a tip because I really don't know who's fault it was for the extreme delay of the appetizer. In summary, good food, busy area, personable service, and possibly a long wait... take your chances but don't be in hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40
Jasmine B.,"Houston, TX",0,6,4,1.0,8/7/2017,"Thanks Chilis, my freaking burger was totally disgusting! First of all chili's got my order all wrong I asked for a bacon cheeseburger and they gave me a classic cheeseburger and it was not done. I'm sick and I'm disgusted with chilis. My hamburger patty was totally un cooked. I spoke with the manager and she said she will give me a gift card for my order. I'm still upset I'll never eat at this location again. Ugggghhh I'm soo MAD.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40
Carina B.,"Recreation Farms, TX",3,8,1,1.0,11/19/2017,"I've only been twice and tonight was definitely my last time at this location. Took more than 5 minutes for someone to realize we were waiting to be seated, another 5-10 minutes for someone to take our drink orders, the food took a long time and made both my husband and I sick. The employees look miserable to be working her , everything was bad lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40
Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699,2.0,5/9/2016,"Where do I start with this review of this chain restaurant?  Well, if you follow my reviews, you know that I do not expect anything fancy or any bells and whistle when I go to a chain restaurant.   Most chain restaurants are just a 3 star experience.  You don't expect much, and normally, that is what you get.  This Chili's was below the norm on almost every aspect of the dining experience. This particular location of Chili's started off my experience with your normal jubilant greeting upon arrival, and my party was seated promptly.  No problems there what so ever.  The server came around and was friendly and took the drink orders and gave us time to look over the menu.  The strawberry lemonade tasted like it was made with recycled gym water.  Asked for a lemonade, and to my server's credit, she brought out the lemonade, and a Sprite with blackberry in it.  Both of them taste like depression and sore throats.  I finally just settled on a regular Coca-Cola, which came out tasting proper. The party ordered the following: Big Mouth® Bites - 4 mini burgers with applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, sauteed onions & house-made ranch. 2 order from the 2 for $20 menu -  Appetizer - Spiced Panko Onion Rings & Tostada Chips & Fresh Guacamole Entrees - Half Rack of Original Baby Back Ribs served with home-style fries, twice, 6 oz. Classic Sirloin* and Cajun Chicken pasta I asked to add grilled shrimp to both entrees for $3 more per plate.  The 2 for $20 deal is an excellent buy.  1 appetizer to share and 2 full entrees for a set price.  Plenty to choose from as well.   Well, the chips, guacamole and salsa came out rather quickly.  The chips were fried correctly, thin and lightly salted.  I forgot that the onion rings were ordered and it came out a considerable amount of time later.  Those salty chips really got me needing a refill...and where is the waitress?  Onion rings come and the refill comes a little later.  Onion rings were decent for onion rings...nothing really special. The entrees come and I have to ask for refills again.  Wait...that isn't our food...please still bring refills though! Our food come for real this time, and our drinks are half full from the wait...and everything looks good.  I'll spare you all of the details, but the following mistakes were made: I asked for my steak to be medium and it came out well done.  It was sent back to be made again...I eventually gave up on it coming to the table and just asked them to give it to me in a to go box. For the big mouth bites, barbeque sauce was asked for and it never made it to our meal...I mean NEVER! They forgot to add the shrimp to the orders. We constantly asked for refills and asked for the forgotten items...but just realized we were just the forgotten. All in all, I was not expecting the food to knock my socks off.  It is a national chain and the food was as expected...when we got the food we asked for...which sometimes was NEVER.  This chain has to do better.  The place wasn't even packed!  No excuse is legitimate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40
Ericka A.,"Houston, TX",0,6,6,4.0,8/12/2017,"Overall good experience. There was no wait. The food was good. They took a little while to bring out the sliders we ordered, but they continously came by the table to apologize for the wait. Chris was a great waiter.

Vivian B.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/26/2017,"My experience was horrible, the waiter paid absolutely no attention to my table. Each thing I asked for came out 25 minutes after asking. The waitress (Young Hispanic woman) had the worst attitude I've ever seen in the customer service business.

Ericka B.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/27/2017,"The worst Chili's experience I ever had. It took someone 15 minutes to greet me at the door. Once I was greeted, the hostess was very dry & not friendly at all. I was seated at a dirty table & I didn't have a waiter for 30 minutes! The waiter that finally came to the table didn't apologize for the delay and when I asked for the manager, Eric Estrada he was very rude and unprofessional.

Marco R.,"Houston, TX",106,126,297,1.0,2/1/2016,"So many things wrong with this place... Came here with a friend, and ended up leaving within 10 minutes. It took forever for someone to acknowledge us and sit us down. Then when we finally get a waiter, it all goes wrong. We ask for waters, and waiter comes back with our waters, only to find that there were boogers inside of our drinks.. Like seriously? I should of shut their ass down right then and there.  Boogers inside of drinks? That's absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. Have never gone back to that location since then, and probably will never. Staff is usually ways lacking at that location.

Lisa T.,"Oakland, CA",0,9,,2.0,1/6/2017,"The seating hostess tonight barely greeted us, then gave us a eye roll when we asked for a booth after being shown a table.

John R.,"Houston, TX",341,189,242,4.0,5/29/2015,"I have been here  a few times over the past couple of months for meetings in a company that I am starting.  They have a long booth that comfortably seats 8 people near the front, and we were able to you use this as our meeting space.  The waitstaff has always been very accommodating and understanding even though we would typically take a few hours during the meetings.  I find this environment more comfortable, and the staff love it because they get free lunch and sometimes a drink or two. The lunch specials are very reasonable as well as the 2 for $20 entrees. I find the food here to be consistent with Chili's standards.  In particular, I really enjoy the fall off the bone ribs. I also tried the new fried pickles and I highly recommend them if you want a bit of a kick. Mostly, I come here for the service.  I never feel rushed to finish our meeting so that the waiter can turn the table nor do they give us problems when we ask for substitutions and other quirky requests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40
Ashley P.,"Houston, TX",0,8,1,1.0,11/11/2016,"Food has really gone down. My meal tasted like cafeteria food. The service was slow, but the server informed us they had a cook and 3 servers quit.

And not to be a bad customer but working in a Korean restaurant you get to be really anal about presentation I don't know if they were understaffed or what but we didn't have a set waiter I think a manager helped us or someone not wearing  the regular waitstaff apparel . Got our drinks promptly the first time though mine was wrong it wasn't a big deal but after that I didn't get a refill on the drinks until I was done paying the check and it was still wrong after confirming what I wanted.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=20

I didn't say anything the first time, figured it was a busy night. But today it was empty!! Me and my small family stood there for over 10 minutes. I paced around and I made it a point to show I was frustrated but not a single worker showed any interest at all of the people standing at the front.

Vicki B.,"Spring, TX",36,75,28,2.0,12/1/2014,"Haven't been to this Chili's in a while. Not up to the usual standards. Potato Soup was cold, so I sent it back. When it came back, it still wasn't hot enough, but after a while, you just give up. My husband's chili wasn't warm either. He requested crackers and didn't get them until the entrée was delivered. And my fries were lukewarm as if they had been sitting on the counter for a while.  Although they weren't busy, there were dirty tables around us. The server didn't bring me a refill until I had given up and was about to leave.  Overall, the main problem was the fault of the kitchen. My entrée was okay, and so was my husband's, but their timing of the courses of the meal were way off, as was the food temperature.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=20

Michael W.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,1.0,8/28/2016,"I don't know what happened to this place.  We have been going here for lunch on weekends since I moved into the area 15 years ago.  It's gone way downhill over the past several months.  Today was the last straw.  To wait 15 minutes for a waiter to even take a drink order.  Then, he said he would get us free chips and salsa due to the long wait, but he never did.  It was 30 minutes between the food order and receiving the food, and my son's burger had onions when we ordered ""no onions.""  Here's some perspective: when we were seated it was the beginning of the 2nd quarter of the Vikings-Chargers game.  When we left it was the end of the 3rd quarter.  (I paid the bill using the tablet on the table because the waiter was nowhere to be found.)  And we ate quickly because we were dying to get out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=20

Victoria S.,"Houston, TX",47,4,5,1.0,1/2/2017,"Worst experience ever!!! All I was going in for was an online order for the Santa Fe chicken salad. Right away from the beginning the lady named Ellen Ann at the to go registered already had a long face and did not seem happy at all with her job. She was super rude. She asked me what I was there for I said for a pick up I gave her my name and she was like I don't see your name here I said okay she went back to double check and she found my name. She didn't even tell me my total she just extended her hand for payment. She went back to the kitchen left the salad on the counter and went back to the kitchen.  So I waited for her to come back to let her know the tortilla chips that come in the salad I had requested for them to be on the side. She comes back and I mention it to her immediately said oh that wasn't on the order I said I requested it on the side she went back and forth with me arguing about if it was on it or not.  She finally went back to the kitchen to get me some tortilla chips comes back grabs my bag and said look I can show you. I had to stop her from grabbing my bag and still wanted to argue with me that it wasn't on the order on her computer system. I just replied to her look it doesn't even matter anymore. Even leaving out the door she was still arguing so I asked her for her name she said ""Ellen"" I said okay. Still arguing she yells out "" You don't have to worry about me it's my last day here"". No wonder she was acting like that.  I went back to my car and got my receipt to find a phone number to the restaurant it was no where to be found so I went online and found it called Ellen answered again I asked to speak to the manager she put me on hold and nobody ever answered.  I have never been treated like that at a chillis restaurant.  Never will be back to that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=20

On the day of my visit, I was waiting on friends to arrive. I sat there for about an hour without any acknowledgment from the servers or manager who walked by me several times. When I asked for bottomless chips as I wait for my friends, the waiter closest to me (whom I assume was my waiter) looked at me as though I was bothering him. He had someone else (who looked like a host) bring my food out. I heard the manager and a waiter discussing personal information pertaining to their outside activities and I saw waiters hanging out at the back by the end wait station.

WHAT.  UNREAL.   when we told waiter, no apology for misunderstanding or slow service.  Manager did come out and ended up taking half off meal.   But don't think we will ever return to this location.  Andddddd when we first arrived, bathrooms are horrendous.  We should've known then to leave!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=20

Cee M.,"Houston, TX",72,40,1,1.0,8/27/2014,"I decided to give this place another go for carry out...despite lousy service I had in June.  We ordered a BOWL...not a cup, but a BOWL of chili  (among two other entrees).  When we opened up the chili, it was in a CUP size.  If that wasn't bad enough, the cup was only about 60% full!!!!!   What kind of lazy people do they have working in this joint.  Not filling up cups and putting them in the wrong sizes, as well as my last experience at the To GO window of half assed service, as well as a long wait  and total rude clientale parked in the TO GO spaces for an hour long lunch.  Unbelievable....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Amanda M.,"Spring, TX",1,8,,1.0,3/2/2015,I met a friend for lunch and we both ordered soup and salad. It took over 30 minutes for the waitress to bring our food and that was after I got up and asked the hostess for the manager.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Penguin S.,"Houston, TX",140,713,169,3.0,11/29/2011,"I've been coming here for at least 12 years. It's one of my grandmother's favorite places and I recall eating here before my grandfather passed away.  I know I enjoy their soft tacos and the burgers are OK. I also like the chicken strips with honey mustard. This trip I tried the grilled margarita chicken, with rice and black beans. They were really good, but the chicken was nearly undercooked. We split some cheese fries, which could have used a bit more cheese, but they were good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Bree T.,"Houston, TX",58,15,1,1.0,7/21/2014,"We came here for my brother in laws birthday. The service was absolutely horrible!! It took nearly two hours to dine, and it wasn't even busy. They messed up our order multiple times. The staff was more concerned about hanging out with their friends than attending to us. They offered the kids some oranges to make up for one mistake, and then charged us for them! When I spoke to the manager he was very passive, and just unconcerned. Worst experience of my life! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Marilea J.,"Oklahoma City, OK",11,35,2,4.0,1/6/2013,I love chilis! Lots of options for any taste bud. Service was ok. I asked for no mayo on my burger and they added it anyway. Had to ask to return it. I had to remind our server of my margarita which I'm sure he forgot to put it in. Food was hot and fresh. Drinks stayed filled. First time to this chilis.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Ed G.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,1.0,2/28/2015,"took at least 20 minute before i had someone to take our orders, when we did get our food, it was terrible, and was also cold. didn't have anyone come over and check on us until the very end when i had to get up and ask for the check. worst chilis I've have ever been too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Jasmine P.,"Denver, CO",51,159,,3.0,9/3/2008,"I always expect excellent service at Chili's to order take out; however, this one time it just sucked. I went in to order and had to wait about 5 minutes before someone came to the register. She was friendly; however, but wasn't trying to sell or push items on me, which helps me. I ordered Citrus Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas but I can never remember the beans and rice and usually the person reminds me, but she didn't and I forgot. I asked for extra extra cheese and she did not add that. Not to mention once I order and gave her the items she had to sit there and asked me over again....doesn't make sense to do that if you were listening in the first place. I called into the store once I got home and discovered my half order and had to go all the way back up there to pick up items, go home and eat. My food was cold by then and lost its excitement. Overall this location isn't really that great to me for curbside or to go orders. Overall nope.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Dawn S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",269,261,80,4.0,6/14/2008,"OK, granted, I was with a traveling companion that is quite picky about her dining establishments; however, we were meeting up with a business partner who selected the venue (so we had no choice).  Chili's is one of those places that is a great place to go when you've got a bigger group to feed - there are enough things on the menu that palates and limitations are usually covered on the menu. My colleague ordered the ""healthy"" chicken option, our business partner ordered the chicken caesar salad, and I had the mesquite grilled chicken salad. Plus, if you're a road warrior, Chili's is a place that's always ""safe"" - it's in pretty much most cities/towns and the menu is always predictable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Tylena P.,"Houston, TX",202,1,,5.0,4/26/2011,"I absolutely love, love, love Chili's I have to have my Chili's fix at least twice a week! Keep up the great flavor, U r trully appreciated!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
Michelle C.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,5.0,10/22/2010,I frequent Chili's once a week and have always had good service and pleasant atmosphere. My recent visit to the FM1960 location was a Great experience. I went in for happy hour and received just that. A HAPPY good time. The margaritas are to die for and the atmosphere is always so fresh and so clean. The bartender mixes the best happy hour drinks ever. What a marvelous way to wine down the day. The friendly staff is always pleasant and ready to serve up superb customer service. I love this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=40
