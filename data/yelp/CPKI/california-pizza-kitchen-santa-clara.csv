Onik R.,"Belmont, CA",186,150,110,4.0,11/18/2017,"Surprisingly great for a chain restaurant. I have not been back to CPK in years, but boy have they upped their game. Both the food and decor have inoroved significantly. This location is extremely busy due to it being at Valley Fair Mall. Expect a 30-45 minute wait. Thankfully, we were able to get seated at the counter which is first come first serve without reservations. But this was very hectic and disorganized, as they were understaffed. Many tables also weren't being serviced, which led to longer wait times for everyone. We ordered the classic BBQ chicken pizza and buffalo fried cauliflower. Both were great. The cauliflower was perfectly crispy, and beautifully presented. Very similar to the flavors in buffalo wings but vegetarian. The pizza was also great, with a crust that was just the right balance between chewy and crispy. We also got the butter cake with Haagen Daz for dessert. This was buttery and a good complement of warm and cold, but very sweet.  What impressed me the most was how great service was. Both the host who sat us at the bar and our server were friendly and hospitable, even in what looked like a very hectic environment. Who knew chains could be so good?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara
Colby D.,"San Jose, CA",157,552,1928,3.0,12/13/2017,"~ QUEST FOR THE BEST: PIZZA EDITION ~  #7 out of 12 in Fast Food Pizza California Pizza Kitchen is known for their BBQ chicken pizza, which is the one pizza I had never tried in all my CPK visits. We ordered that this time. Aside from the dry crust, the pizza was pretty good. The BBQ chicken pizza is definitely their best pizza, but I remember the Thai pizza from a previous visit being unique and good as well. What's good about their BBQ chicken pizza is that they don't incorrectly assume people want as much bbq sauce as they would tomato sauce. The toppings are also cut into manageable pieces, and the ratios are just right. I hardly ever go to CPK because they're only in malls near me, but I do want to return sometime soon to try their new prawn pizza. That's the thing about CPK: their traditional pizzas are not the best, but they have some mighty interesting alternatives.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara

Delivered was a burnt cheese pizza and a chopped salad. Who knows if it was gluten free or not since no markings it was.

Ria A.,"San Jose, CA",435,68,383,5.0,10/31/2017,"The 5 star rating is just for the service! We stopped in here for lunch after shopping at Valley Fair. As we were just hoping for a quick bite to eat before leaving the mall, we weren't expecting (or hoping) for anything extraordinary. Before I even get into the review of the restaurant, I just want to mention Mylynh is the best waitress we've EVER had!  Of all the restaurants we've been to (which is a lot!), I've never experienced better customer service! As soon as we were seated, MyLynh approached us with her big smile and greeted us. She wished us a great Halloween, talked to us about our Halloween plans, her outfit, and spent time getting to know us before getting to ""business.""  I'm assuming she's a student but the restaurant should use her to train the rest of their staff on great service! For food:  We ordered their spicy buffalo cauliflower (awesome!!), a chicken sandwich, farmer's market soup, and a kid's pizza. Everything came out fast and was delicious. As this is a chain restaurant, located inside a mall, I certainly wasn't expecting ""great"" food. To my surprise, everything was great!  Overall, food was good. However, the service was the best part. I will ask for MyLynh by name if/when we come back here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara

Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",970,1933,3490,4.0,12/14/2017,"I love CPK but found it harder to buy their pizzas after I found out they had frozen varieties of the same flavors. It's like eating at Marie Calendar's after finding out that they have the same meals served frozen. It makes you wonder if you're overpaying for the same exact product. This CPK is located in VF mall and is a great pitstop to fuel you up for some more shopping. You can order online. They offer a variety of things outside of pizzas. They have salad bowls, tacos, pastas and sandwiches. They have lots of dishes with an Asian or Mexican flair (that California-touch). My favorite pizza is the Thai and margherita (a pizza my bf finds plain and weird due to the ""islands"" of cheese""). I've never tried their desserts but they do offer a variety of them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara

Emily Y.,"Campbell, CA",378,162,465,4.0,4/9/2017,"First time trying this chain restaurant CPK at valley fair location and it was surprisingly very good. We came in at around 2pm when it was always passed lunch time, so the wait time was only 20mins, not bad at all. My girlfriend orders 4 dished - 3 seasonal items: mushroom pasta, green hot peppers, bacon pizza (I wasn't sure exactly the name of these dishes as I was looking for parking and heading to meet her up while she ordered it for us), and chicken salad. The service was quick and fast, and the food was ready within 15-20mins after ordering them, very efficient. I love every dish we got and we devoured all of them, very satisfied with the food quality and service.  The ambient was really nice inside and I saw people sitting the bar eating as well, this could totally be a fun HH event. I absolutely love their CPK foods and would definitely come back again, of course not during the peak hours lol.  All dishes came out to be approximately $50 in total and we were stuffed and ready to do some shopping and walked it off some calories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara
Patrick A.,"San Jose, CA",169,85,139,3.0,9/9/2017,"I love CPK and I really wanted to give this location 5 stars because of the service alone. Unfortunately, the construction sort of hindered my experience.  My girlfriend and I arrived and we were sat immediately. The host was super friendly and so was our server, Taylor. We started with the artichoke dip and a couple beverages: a mai tai and and Moscow Mule. The Mules here are pretty good, but maybe not the best choice with the artichoke dip. The dip was great, though. It was cheesy and it had nice, soft chunks of artichoke. It would have gone great with an 805.  For our entrees, we ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and the Shrimp Scampi with Zucchini. The chicken was perfect. Great presentation, tasty flavors, and the bok choi and mushrooms in the sauce were a perfect selection. Unfortunately, the shrimp dish was...well...not what we expected. It might have been an over-sight by the kitchen when they plated the dish. I hope next time they're a little more vigilant. For me, it's all about service, and Taylor nearly hit a homerun. We'll call this one a ground-rule double because of ""fan"" interference. Hopefully, our tip reciprocated her good service. We spoke with the manager, who was also super friendly, and told her about our concern regarding the shrimp dish. She also took care of us with care and sympathy. In the end, our experience with CPK wasn't ruined because I know how well their food can be and how great their service is. We'll definitely give it another shot, but we'll probably wait for construction to finish. So this is a temporary 3 stars for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara

Jay D.,"Brentwood, CA",98,50,93,4.0,6/13/2017,I come here for only one thing. Their rib eye is very good for the price. It is a decent size cut about 12oz. It comes with arugula salad and a side of garlic patatos.  I always get mine cooked medium rare and they seem to be on point with it. Sometimes you get fattier cuts but that is where the flavor is it. A good appetizer would be the white corn avocado and chip. Decent size for 2 people mixed with light saltiness from the chips and sweetness from the dip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara
Melissa L.,"Silicon Valley, CA",193,285,336,3.0,10/8/2016,Came here after a day of shopping at valley fair and was craving pasta. I ordered the chicken tequila fettuccini since it was marked as a favorite dish. It was good but honestly was lacking sauce and a bit of flavor.  Also wanted a sangria so ordered the trio. If you ask they'll let you swap out some for others on the menu. I wanted to try the blood orange which wasn't part of the trio originally. The sampler is good because you get variety and 3 glasses that are 3 oz each which is like ordering one it you get variety of flavors.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara

Matthew J.,"San Jose, CA",393,260,1790,4.0,1/5/2017,"Hangry- is a clever portmanteau of hungry and angry, and an adjective that describes being irritable due to hunger. Prior to entering the mall, the Wife & I had to eat!! We both were raging, chipping at each other and we were so HANGRY!!! The hostess sat us next to a wild family. WTH!?!? Possibly from parts unknown... Maybe....Trailer Park?! They were LOUD, had no filter!!   I'm HANGRY!?!?  I don't need this!?!!!

We didn't have any kids in tow..They were at school!! Johnny at the Bar was GREAT!!! Ordered up some appetizers... Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumpling...OUTSTANDING! I could of ate 2 orders to myself!! The White Corn Guacamole +Chips..Disappointing.. Needed 2 hand to scoop! I ordered, BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad w/Avocado It was ok. Hardly any meat. For $3 dollars extra for Avocado, I hardly noticed that it was there.  The salad was bland, with a mayo after taste. I used a lot of Chalupa hot sauce to give it flavor.  The Wife ordered a Lunch Duo. Pepperoni pizza- personal 4 slices and salad, Super Spinach+ Quinoa. She enjoyed it! I did grab a slice of her pizza...It was very good!! I have had their pizza before via Doordash and I've turned into a fan!!!   If you've read or seen any of my YELP, you should know that I love PIZZA!! We had great service!

Belle A.,"Campbell, CA",1,47,7,3.0,12/2/2017,"I thought the pizza quality would be a bit better considering they specialize in pizza.  My husband and I ordered the barbeque chicken pizza, and while the toppings were pretty tasty, the dough was a bit ""doughy"" (especially the crust) and undercooked.  The barbeque chicken chopped salad was also underdressed and had too many tortilla strips.   Oddly enough, the redeeming dish of our meal was the kung pao spaghetti.  It was just the right amount of spicy and the spaghetti noodles were a perfect al dente.   Our server (unfortunately, I forgot his name) was very attentive and efficient.  Also, it seemed that the staff communicated and worked pretty well together.   Bonus - It is located in Valley Fair Mall, so you can do some shopping before or after.  Also, if you park in the newer Macy's parking structure, the restaurant is conveniently located right next to the entrance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara

I asked my waitress Bianca Danielle for a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. JUST a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. She then repeated the order with a whole different pizza with sausage on it. I then corrected her that I wanted JUST pepperoni and mushroom.  My pizza then came with basil. And not very much pepperoni or mushroom. The sauce was very minimal as well.

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, although some sports game was on and a lot of the staff were distracted. For food: - Weird deconstructed salad wedge thing with eggs and bacon... It looked like a dish I made myself by throwing together the leftovers in my fridge. I suggest you pass on this one. - Combination pizza was pretty good. Could tell it was freshly made. - Creamy pasta with sun dried tomatoes and chicken: Great! Loved it! My favorite dish of the evening. I love sun dried tomatoes because they add such wonderful flavor to a possibly plain dish like pasta. - Lemonade: I liked! Sweet and tangy, quite refreshing.  They messed up on our bill at the end.

They have a nice long bar with plenty of seats that we like. A decent beer selection and reasonably priced and healthy lunch combos keep us coming back. The beer selection is pretty corporate, big names only. It would be nice to see some more local brews on tap but all in all there is always something that I want to drink on tap. My last trip I went with the Sam Adams ""Rebel"" IPA, yummy! I have a favorite lunch combo I'll share with you. The Pepperoni Sausage and Mushroom mini (more like micro) Pizza with the Spinach Salad. Here's an embedded tip... Ask for the salad to come out first otherwise you will get your pizza and salad served together. I personally like to eat my salad first and have an internal struggle when something awesome like a pizza has to compete with a salad sitting next to it... So the Pizzas are really small (6"") but teamed with a small salad it's just about the right sized lunch for about $11. Chunky Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushrooms on top of perfectly gooey and crispy dough is a real treat, even if it's micro sized. The Spinach salad is really awesome, it's served with a sweet and tangy dressing on the side and topped with candied nuts, crisp apple slices, Quinoa, and some slivered carrots. Delicious! This is a solid stop for lunch, even if you're not at the mall to shop and it's priced much better than anything at Santana Row across the street...

When i got the order after paying, none of the pizza had dressings. Just Plain dough .i mean like if i just want to eat baked dough , can eat at home. Their reason: they are out of dressings and seasonings. I don't understand if you claim the order complete and have guts to ask for money, you should make sure pizza is complete. Chipolte pizza and tostada pizza is just dough without the dressing and nobody wants to pay 15 bucks for that. After some explanation, they get some dressing but of different pizza to keep us going.

Second lie. We saw her talking  to them and the hostess  who we complained about kept looking  over at our table and laughing.  I was unaware  this team was managed by immature idiots who lack customer service and people skills.  The manager never apologized  for our bad experience  nor did she ever come back to check on our table. Our amazing waitress LORENA had more management  skill than her own manager. She apologized profusely and asked if there was anything she could do to fix things.

It begins at the front desk and when it's being run by a bunch of idiots too busy to be bothered to do their job correctly i dont see how this location will be successful.

She was really friendly, checked in on us a lot, and was super helpful.  Other than that - pretty bad first experience here. Our bread came with a dish FULL to the brim with olive oil - no balsamic. Even when we asked for extra, there was so much oil in the dish it was useless. Second, they were out of all draft beer and mostly all bottled beers. Not a huge problem, but no warning so we spent  some time naming out beers we wanted to keep getting a ""'no we're out"" response. Third, the food was really subpar. I ordered a Cobb salad, no taste and no dressing. My mom ordered chicken piccata and the chicken was basically rubber. Somehow they managed to mess up the guac too.  Probably won't be coming to another California pizza kitchen - but Talia you were awesome!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=20

The California Pizza Kitchen at Westfield Valley Fair is my favorite location for one reason, the floor manager is so good.  She buzzes around like a bee.  Any time I have had even a tiny issue, sometimes when I didn't even know I had an issue, she swoops in and makes things great.  Tonight's experience was trouble-free, but she was still there making sure it was all smooth. The new parking structure adjacent to the mall is open now and next to the entry to the restaurant so parking was the easiest I have ever experienced at Valley Fair.  Nice. Jason and his wife shared a pasta dish.  I ordered the half California Cobb Salad, good as always, and tried a non-alcoholic froufrou mango cooler drink that wasn't half bad.  We shared the Chicken Dumpling appetizer (yums) and a couple thin crust pizzas we literally chose from the pictures on the front of the menus.  One pizza was Jamaican Jerk Chicken-- probably not the right name for the pizza, I did not detect any jerk flavor, but it was really gooood.  Thin crust, a sweet-spicy sauce, red onion, red bell pepper and applewood smoked bacon, what's not to like.  We also had a thin crust Spinach Artichoke pizza with chicken which was also tight.

Susan M.,"Foster City, CA",486,288,1376,4.0,6/8/2015,"Decided to come here because I had a gift card. (They sell CPK gift cards at Costco!!) It was super crowded on a Friday night, but luckily, we only had to wait about 15 mins.  Started off with the avocado eggrolls and then got the chopped chicken salad (whole) and the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza to share. The avocado eggrolls were good, but not even close to the quality and deliciousness of the ones at Cheesecake Factory. They've got cheese and chicken in them and a crispy  thin shell. The chopped chicken salad was fresh and tasty. At about $15 a plate, it is a little pricey, but the food here is generally a little bit expensive for the quality. I always get the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. It's got an interesting taste to it that you can't get anywhere else. Seems like it's got some sweet and sour sauce on it with pepper and maybe cinnamon? Lots of interesting flavors. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of it, but I thought it was delicious because it tasted so different from a normal pizza.  Service was great, fast and friendly. Kitchen seemed really quick which was great for getting people in and out when it's super busy.

Ordered the roasted garlic chicken and we thought it was mehhh. The pizza was overloaded with garlic so i couldn't really taste the cheese, sauce, or anything on the pizza, just a chunks of garlic.

Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",448,568,3762,4.0,1/9/2016,"25 minute wait for two on Friday night. We shopped around for a bit and were seated after coming back. Lots of families with strollers parked around the waiting area. I've never seen this place so busy, and with lots of kids. My friend and I sat at one of those high tables in the rear meant for four so we had plenty of room. It was a lot quieter since the kids that could sit on those chairs had to be old enough not to fall. Sarah was prompt to ask for drink orders and brought them out with the bread I asked for (upon request). It comes with olive oil dipping sauce and the bread was toasty warm.  She proceeded to take our entree orders: wild mushroom pizza and half Thai crunch salad. Both were delicious and a portion of the pizza had a lot of cheese and herbs on it-- so good and fragrant with every bite! I finished my half salad and was surprised I didn't have to ask for less dressing. Last time I ate at a CPK it was almost drenched, not at this location though. Salad presentation was great! I dug in without taking any photos, sorry! The greens, edamame, cucumber slivers, and peanuts were evenly coated in sweet peanut dressing, generously topped with thin rice sticks that were drizzled beautifully with more dressing. For $11.50 it was very filling. The $15 full size would've been too much.  While service was always polite and friendly, our waitress wasn't around much aside from taking our orders and asking how we were doing. I think her other tables were far from ours. We asked a different waitress for napkins and she obliged. Payment was quick and the leftover pizza boxed up. Our water wasn't refilled so I assume they're still conserving water.  Turns out the Take Out area was on that end of the bar behind us. It's not the best location for that. Stanford shopping center has a designated take out area right behind the hostess stand, which is a lot more convenient than walking all the way to the back of the restaurant. I ordered a take out CA club pizza from this area and it was so busy no one came around for five minutes. With a 15 min quote, I told the manager(?) who rang me up we'd come back after shopping. Well, I came back half an hour later and this lovely lady named Sheena with stylish crimped platinum blonde hair and black roots tied up with a bandana headband already knew the CA club was for me (was she psychic?). She assured me twice the staff was preparing the salad topping fresh. I didn't mind the wait as my friend and I took our seats at the bar. It's rare to encounter smiling upbeat workers so near to closing, but she made my CPK experience end on a brighter note.

Jimmy L.,"San Jose, CA",33,854,133,3.0,8/29/2016,"Twas 8:30pm, and the Cheesecake Factory had an hour and a half wait, so Dad and I ventured here. They were crowded, but the wait time for a table was only about 15 min. or so.  We were seated by a server with a good smile.  In the past, I'd normally share a pizza and appetizer with someone, and get maybe like a half of a BBQ Chicken Salad, and the food has always been fairly good. Pizzas are normally California style with a hand-tossed thin crust topped with a variety of non-traditional ingredients and sauces. One of the proverbial favorites is the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which has a reall good flavor profile. Some are gluten-free, I think. I thought I'd venture out of my comfort zone and order something other than salad. As I was looking at the menu, though, maybe a 1/3 of it is (naturally) pizza, and the rest of the menu are appetizers, soups/salads, drinks, a handful of specialty entrees, and a handful of pastas.  I went with the Jambalaya Fettucini - spicy, w/blackened shrimp, crawfish, chicken, andouille sausage, and ham ($16.99). My Dad ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti, which he said was good. Wait time was a good 15 min, or so.  On mine, though the flavor profile was pretty good, and piping hot, the pasta was still raw. Now, I like al dente, but the texture on the pasta was still hard! I sent it back, and had to wait another 15 minutes. The server reassured me that they would cook the pasta a little bit longer. The next one came out even more piping hot, and though it didn't have the crunchy texture this time, the pasta was still firm, and pretty borderline al dente on the firmer side, but better than the first. There is actually a really good amount of all the ingredients. My only comment about the dish though, is that it's a bit too complex with a shitload of ingredients, and prob could do without the chicken and the ham.  Been coming here off and on over the 15 years they've been here, and have always been a fairly decent standby. They are most definitely family friendly, casual, and have a good formula going.  On the other hand though, this will never be my top go-to place. I do think that the chain kind of needs to freshen things up a bit from the bottom up - from restaurant design - to menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=40

They were not responsible and skipped the people waiting in the line on purpose. They tried to justify that she called at outside of the restaurant and nobody answered. But we were sitting inside on the waiting bench, right in front of their desk, why didn't she ask inside? If I didn't check, we would be waiting there without knowing we've been skipped! She didn't even say sorry and just let us keep waiting!  Finally we were led to a table by a girl who was much better and at least apologized to us for those two rude girls in the front desk. Then came the waiter, cold, and didn't care about us at all. He served three dirty plates like being left on another table, with oil on it. We requested to change. Then he brought another three, still not clean. He said, ""Oh we can not polish the plates"". Third time, I took the picture attached with this review. What can I say? We will not be here anymore. No mention how slow the pizza was served and that they gave us another table's receipt.

Good ambience and decently spaced though 'pricey' the food flavors are great. Weekends especially calls for a waiting time which sometimes is annoying considering the walks n shops n bags one already has gone through in the mall! The summer seasonal sip for the day- Strawberry-Mango cooler was very refreshing! Rightly sweet n chilled! Amazing to beat the stress n heat. California veggie is one pizza always n one on our table as i am a vegetarian. Flavors are good,though if spiced up a bit it'll be scrumptious! Portion size meant for two. The base was soft and not chewy though the pizza didn't have a load full of veggies it tasted well to the palate. The Tortilla spring rolls were amazing. Rightly spiced,great crunch and the mushroom stuffed to the right portion this bite just melted in the mouth. Served with salsa dip it tasted great. For dessert,again to the season we had the strawberry shortcake with icecream and whipped cream! Simply Wow!! I forgot to count in the calories I loaded on myself then! Not too sweet,the shortcake cookie was fresh and moist to bite n eat. Strawberries though were slightly sour when had single. Overall great flavors to their foods.

The egg rolls tasted just like it was advertised.  I could not wrap my head around the fact that I was eating a fried club sandwich.  The egg rolls were served along with two dipping sauces: ranch and a chipotle sauce.  The chipotle sauce tasted more flavorful than the ranch so it was my favorite sauce to dip the egg rolls.  For our main course, the Sicilian pizza was thin and crispy and topped with sausage, prosciutto, basil, and pepperoni. The menu said it was supposed to be spicy, but since it was not we ended up showing the pizza with pepper flakes.   The service is decent and the atmosphere is casual.  The food is just ok, but CPK is a quieter place to go if you want to get away from the mall crowd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=60

The layout is beyond strange at this location and I was left staring at a poster for a children's place store in the midst of a dark abyss.  Once food arrived it was decent, but it was darn near impossible to get any help thereafter. Don't order the Iced tea, because they seem to take that term literally, with no effort to add or supply you with any sweetener to speak of. Their lunch special is a pretty good deal which is about the nicest thing I can think to say about this place. I would go again, I just don't think I'll go to this specific location. There are far too many other places in this mall where I won't be treated like a leper and left alone for the majority of my visit.

Garlic shrimp pasta - that was nice. Neutral:  Margarita thin crust pizza was ok... It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. Cons:  Bianca flatbread - It was definitely not for our taste buds. It had a weird aftertaste (but remember, that just might be our taste buds.)

Food is still good, although I think the portions got a bit smaller.  One of my favorite dishes is the Kung Pow Spaghetti with chicken that I usually order when I'm not really feelin' pizza.  I love that bite of spice it has with the red chilies that works perfectly with the peanut sauce and scallions.  But the last time I ordered it the bowl seemed huge which may have served to greatly contrast the portion of ""schetti"" I was actually served.  In the past I typically don't finish my entire meal and box it up to take it home for a midnight snack...  No midnight snack for me this time :(  Maybe I was just really hungry...

I asked for something, she acknowledged and then forgot about it.  Service is very slow and inconsistent. We have been served bread and olive oil in the past. And also saw it on other tables when we were seated but they did not serve us that. Anyhow we had few appetizers in mind so didn't miss it much, but pointing out inconsistency. There was no silverware provided on our table.  We placed our order of soup, appetizers and main course. She got us appetizers and some main course. So we inquired if she was getting the soup, lest she forgot about it. She replies I got what my two hands could carry :( Is that how you reply to customers in hospitality industry? All she had to say is, its coming up.  Quesadillas were burnt. Nuts had gone rancid in Pear and gorgonzola pizza, so we informed the server.

Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2247,2841,1486,2.0,1/7/2014,"I mean, it's a chain restaurant in San Jose. So I went into it with low expectations. I really did. But for whatever reason my friend really wanted to go here tonight, so we ducked in while we waited for his iPhone to be repaired. I think he's just an Apple addict who wanted to be close-by in case something went wrong, so he could burn the case in effigy or something. He's kinda that guy. So in we went. I got a salad since I didn't want to do pizza at 7:45pm. A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips, and all that. He ordered a salmon dish from the ""light"" menu. We also had a special menu item, guacamole and chips, while we waited. The guacamole was bland. No other way to say it. Also, the portion was small enough that even though there were only about 15 chips on the plate, they outlasted the guacamole. I don't think this was a kitchen issue, it looked just like the picture on the menu. I just think that it's poorly conceptualized as an appetizer. The salad was just so-so. For the same price, the Cheesecake Factory, just down the hallway, is three times better and 50% bigger. My friend's salmon was just a bit dry and overcooked, and the portion was a little on the small side.  Disappointing to say the least; although again, pretty consistent with my experience of anything that's not pizza at CPK. The hosts and servers couldn't have been any nicer, which is why it's two and not one star, and I half-think that the kitchen did the best they could with uninspiring recipes and mediocre quality ingredients. But yeah, I'll pass. And my stomach was upset later too, if the humdrum dining experience wasn't enough.

I had ordered food to go and got there at 6:15pm but didn't leave until 6:45pm with my cold food. Why did this take ridiculously long??????? All because I had asked for extra sauce which mind you I had asked for extra sauce when placing my order online but after looking at both of the pasta it was clear that there was barely any sauce. After 15 minutes of waiting for 2 table spoon of sauce I told the girl that wasn't enough and needed more...so here we go again waiting for more damn sauce and after 10 minutes she comes back with more sauce and says per her manager she needs to charge me for all this extra sauce. UHHHM WHAT?!?!?!?!!? Again this was not my first time at cpk or this location of cpk but definitely my last time here.  I told her to get her manager over here. He comes over and I'm absolutely livid with this unacceptable service and he sees nothing wrong with my pasta and only thinks that the only thing they did wrong was miss my asking for extra sauce to begin with uhhm no big deal that I've been waiting around for 30 MINUTES just for this damn extra sauce that they wanted to all of sudden charge me extra for which btw I've never been charged extra for..I did not receive an apology just him saying that he would take 20% off my order..that was cold by the time I got home.

It's a smaller location, but luckily we didn't have to wait since it was a weeknight. I didn't appreciate being seated at the second table to the outside door because it was super windy, and the waiters kept going in and out of this door. Not sure why, pick ups? Also, being seated here, our waitress wasn't super attentive, or was just super busy. Had to ask for utensils, plates, and the bread (the madre was starving), which should be pretty common things to give. When she finally gave us 3 slices of bread, I had to ask her for the utensils and plates as she walked away. Ridiculous. I normally order the garlic chicken pizza, but decided to change it up with the Jamacian Jerk pizza. When I asked her how it was, she said it was pretty sweet, but good. My mom ordered the jambalaya pasta, which I had remembered being good, and my dad ordered the steak tacos (he's an odd one). Our food came out, by another staf, and I sampled the jambalaya pasta first cuz they give you a ton! Pretty good, a bit on the salty side, but really liked the noodles. They were perfect al dente and width. My pizza was wayyyyyyy too sweet, but nothing a little ranch couldn't fix. Which another waitress brought. I think our waitress was being totally overworked? Not sure, but weird that she didn't come around much. My dad enjoyed his tacos, and they give you a good amount of blue and corn tortilla chips.  My waitress saw my soda was dwindling and that she'd bring me a new one. It took a good while before she brought one.  3 stars for the so-so service and seating us in the way back when there were other tables.

This location is nice and spacious, not small and crowded like the ones in Hawaii, and the servers are extremely attentive. Speaking of, Nick, my server for a couple my visits, was GREAT!!! Since I was all alone, it was great that he didn't bug me too much but just made sure I had what I needed.  The food is pretty fantastic too. I had their BBQ Chicken Salad which was super tasty. the Sage and Truffle pizza was -Ah-MaZing and it's a good thing they keep that rich tasting pizza small, the corn/tortilla soup is okay but not amazing, the Lobster-mayo pizza is only good if you're a super fan of lobster and mayonnaise, and the Salted Caramel pudding is pretty yummy!! What I'm really saying is this: everything is spot-on delicious! I always tell myself to be more adventurous when I go to an old favorite spot, but sometimes that sentiment is hard to keep when going off-book ends in disappointment.

Cindy K.,"Folsom, CA",208,1066,517,2.0,2/2/2014,"I hadn't been to this CPK in over a year since the one at Oakridge is closer to home, but since I was at the mall and this is one of my go to places for lunch. It was an interesting and refreshing surprise to see they had redecorated/refurnished the whole restaurant. There's slightly more seating now. Service is still on the slow side.  I try to avoid eating here exactly around noon. I like to go around 11 or 1 to avoid the crowd and long wait for a table.  CPK keeps reinventing themselves. Which is nice. They're trying to cater to their customers' palettes. I love their new bread and olive oil. Really yummy. The spices they add to the olive oil is a nice touch. However, our food was a little disappointing this time around. I pretty much always order the same thing, which helps me gauge the quality of the food. Or you could say I'm boring. Well I always get the tortilla springs rolls, baja chicken and thai chicken. I also get the wild mushroom pizza.  - I think the avocado they used for the guac wasn't ripe enough.  - Spring rolls were burnt on the ends and ruined the overall taste for me. - No shitake mushrooms on the wild mushroom pizza?! - Pizza was super soggy in the center. I think that was the first time my spring rolls were burned like that. Huge disappointment. Perhaps they changed the ingredients on the wild mushroom pizza. It was a new taste. It was yummy. I really love mushroom, but I was sad that there wasn't any portobello or shitake mushrooms on the pizza. What really got me upset was that the center of the pizza was soggy. That's never happened to me before. Blehh. At least the crust was crispy and good.  Our waitress was nice. Even though it was busy and she didn't get check on us that often, she made up for it by giving us promptly giving us stuff when we asked for it.  Oh and what happened to their small bites?? Oh well.

The manager was on her cell phone at the host podium, so was the host by the way. The server was slow it took her a solid 10-15 mins to even show her face again after dropping off our check. The manager finally came to take our credit card after looking up from her phone and realizing we were ready to go. I don't expect much from CPK but if the manager can't even stay off her phone it definitely doesn't set a good example for the rest of the staff to stay off their phones too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=140
Shirley M.,"Boulder Creek, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/21/2017,Usually love this place but today we just had bad service from the hostess. I sent my mom to get a table with my toddler so she could order some dinner for the kids that would be ready asap while I round up my other two at the kids open play area at the mall. The hostess refused to seat her until all in the party was present. It's a Tuesday and it wasn't busy... wouldn't explain herself when I asked her her reasoning. Brushed it off like servicing customers wasn't her job. I've worked many years in the industry and it's staff like this that really upset and make me not spend my money there anymore. Hopefully they can resolve the issue by training someone who can think for themselves and attempt to accommodate a family with three small children. Won't be back for awhile which is too bad.

Stephani M.,"Airport Mail Center, CA",607,405,1744,5.0,1/3/2015,"#2 Wow...I simply cannot believe how CPK makes such great food every time I visit.   My GF Ilana, her son and I were out shopping at Westfield Mall and we both became hungry from all the exercise we were getting strolling in stores--I do not walk about much since foot surgery, so this mall is pretty extreme.  We remembered the CPK we ate at in Pleasanton and decided to give this one a try.  There was a pretty big line for a lunchtime, but we left our name and grabbed a menu to start checking out the selection.  About this time we saw the same manager from the Pleasanton location, Tony, and he remembered us--pulled us out of line and gave us a table...wow!  I told him, ""You know, I wrote a yelp review about you at the other location.""  He said he had read it and thanked me for my kind words, and then explained that this was his primary location, not Pleasanton.  Okay, it's a bit far for me to drive, but it is nice to be treated with such grand hospitality (thanks Yelp!, I think our wait was shortened because he read the review--wink, wink).   Our server approached us, Katie, with a welcoming smile and a great attitude.  My friend's son was ""starving"" and cranky so she asked Katie if we could skip the pleasantries and hurry and get him a pepperoni pizza in the oven.  Katie did not seem irritated by the request at all, and she ran off to accommodate Ilana's son.  Okay, now I am ""wowed"" twice during this visit by CPK. Katie came back and took our drink orders since the kiddie pizza was cooking now.  I asked her to please help me out by recommending her favorite item(s) so I did not hold her up, she looked pretty busy.  She quickly described her favorites, and told me about her favorite 'new' item as well.  She hurried off and ordered our drinks so we could make some decisions.   She arrived back with our drinks and at the same time a young guy delivered the tiny pizza to our minor companion so he could solve the hunger issue he was dealing with, thank G-d, as his i-pad was out of juice, he was hungry, the adult conversation was boring him to death, etc., etc., etc... We made our decisions: Tuscan White Bean Hummus Petite Wedge Salad Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Cedar Plank Salmon Red Velvet Cake  Our hummus was superb and it was served with warm pita bread triangles.  The wedge salad was great, so we shared that after the hummus.  The shrimp was amazing.  It was served with thinly sliced zucchini over top of pasta in a delicious sauce.  I was jealous, as this was Ilana's food--but I kept eating it.  But, my Salmon was 'off the hook' as well.  Salmon served on a cedar plank, along side of a white corn succotash covered with feta...wooooooow, again!   While we were eating the service manager, Deanna, came to the table and invited Ilana's son on a tour of the kitchen to watch the cooks make pizza...wooooooow, again!  How cool for kids to be able to get a little tour and special treatment at such a busy location.   After he returned, the Red Velvet Cake came too!  I never eat sweets too much (I am sweet enough already), but this looked like something my grammy would have made, so just one bite--it was crazy good! Now, I realize CPK is not meant to be fine dining, of course; however, the treatment we received at this particular location was above standard--anywhere!  Tony runs a really tight ship.  You can tell from Katie's professional service, Deanna's awesome guest relations with tiny diners, and the remarkable teamwork we witnessed throughout the restaurant.  We will be back for sure to be ""wowed"" again.

I've had a lot of guacamole and chips.  This guacamole was The BEST I've ever had. Seriously I have never had a guacamole more amazing . the flavors that went into this were so perfectly constructed i didn't even expect the amazingness that came of it . just get it. You will not be disappointed.  My main course was the Main Lobster flat bread.  Again. Whoever made this menu and these dishes are pure genius. The flavors or every ingredient was perfectly fused together. This is an amazing dish and I highly suggest it if you get the chance.  My boyfriend got the kung pao noodles. That shit was the bees knees. So fricken good. Sweet and with a perfect hint of heat. And the shrimps were cooked perfectly. All around great dish!  We both ordered the sangria drinks. They were both really good. The mango one taste strongly of mango and the Appleberry one taste more like the traditional red wine sangria.  Oh yea. dessert.  Forget your stupid diet and get the Strawberry shortcake WITH ice cream. Just do it. Stop questioning it. You DESERVE IT.  SERVICE:  our server tonight was Christian. He was great! He is attentive, and would frequently come by our table to see if everything was okay or of we needed anything else. The manager came by to see how our meal was and that's always nice.

A- for the new chicken dish (great flavor & lovely veggies, but too salty) C+ for the kids' fusilli Alfredo  (my kids who can normally eat adult size meals, didn't even want to finish it.  They thought the sauce was too thick, and wished for some veggie sides.)  Note, my kids are Jr. food critics (amateur ones of course), so may be a bit tough.   Got some potential prize cards for next time I visit, and visit I will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=140

Return home and eat awesome dinner you've been craving. CPK take-out experience: Step 1. Order food. Step 2. Drive to pick up/pay for food only to find out what you've ordered is not ready and not going to be ready because they never called you to tell you they were out of something or not able to make it.

Richard A.,"San Jose, CA",3,10,1,5.0,7/30/2016,We have been coming here since they opened and know the staff and management. They are great and the food is always spot on. The issue I have is they seem to have a new policy which they won't seat you until everyone is here. They know us by name and still refuse to seat us until all were here. Where is the customer service and loyalty to customers that have been coming here for over 8 years. This is sad and may be a deal breaker. So CPK if you are reading this don't let a policy drive consistent customer loyalty away.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=160

Then we also had the garlic sauce pasta. I got the penne to substitute the fettuccine and added onions with sundries tomatoes. It was really good. The garlic cream was not too heavy. And I love how they didn't make it too salty so that you can modify that to your personal taste. For me it wasn't enough salt so I just had to add some and some pepper.

Stephy L.,"San Jose, CA",225,205,246,2.0,6/5/2013,"I used to love CPK more, but lately they have been changing everything and it seemed to go downhill in my perspective. Most of my favorite dishes have been taken out of the menu. I agree that they should change the menu once in a while, but they shouldn't take out the popular dishes.  However, our waiter was friendly and knew what to suggest. I could tell she worked there for a while since she knew the dishes that we wanted were no longer there.  Overall, I was quite disappointed with the food. it was still good, just not as good as it used to be. Especially the tiramisu. I used to love the tiramisu here, but now it just does not taste the same. In addition, I am a huge strawberry lemonade fan, but their lemonade is too sweet. They add too much syrup to the drink and it tastes like you're drinking sugar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=160
Brendan D.,"Cupertino, CA",369,222,92,4.0,11/30/2015,"Just this past Saturday, I was at the mall with my family shopping of course since it was Black Friday weekend, and we decided that it'd be nice to give CPK a shot, since it's been there pretty much forever.  We entered around 5:30pm or so, we asked for a booth and were seated immediately.  After perusing through the menu, I decided on one of their seasonal specials, the sunny side up pizza, my dad went for the thin-crust sicilian pizza, my sister went for the thin-crust chicken pesto and artichoke pizza(not actually sure if this is the name, but that's what was on the pizza ^^), and my mom went for their salmon entree.  We also decided to try some appetizers, so we went for the white corn guacamole with chips and an order of 3 spring rolls thai-style. After taking our orders, our waitress asked if we wanted bread, and of course we did, and in like a minute she quickly returned with a a plate of bread and a plate for each of us to eat off of.  As a dip, we were served a small dish of olive oil that had an abundance of herbs and a few red pepper flakes.  I've actually never been to a restaurant that served herb olive oil with bread before, but it was extremely flavorful, and the red pepper flakes added just a nice hint of spiciness. Our appetizers arrived around 15 minutes or so after we ordered.  I was a bit saddened initially by the amount of guacamole we were served, and it's  maybe a few ounces in weight, but luckily the flavor made up for it.  The white corn was nice, fresh, and crisp, and it added a really nice sweetness to the guacamole.  The chips themselves were perfectly salted and complimented the guacamole well.  The spring rolls we ordered were wrapped in pieces of tortilla and pan-fried.  Each roll was served with it's own dish of peanut sauce, very similar to the peanut sauce you'd get with a Vietnamese spring roll, but more on the peanuty side.  They were a bit on the small side, but after biting them, again I was quite impressed with the flavor and crunch.  The wait for our actual dinners took a bit longer than expected, but our waitress continually checked in on us and apologized for the wait as well as making sure to refill our waters consistently, and offering up more bread each time she came, but after the 2nd order of bread, we had to call it quits to save room for the main meal.  Eventually our meals all came out together nice and hot.  The salmon my mom ordered was cooked on a piece of cedar wood it seems and in an oven.  It was cooked perfectly with a nice char on the outside, yet still soft and moist on the inside.  It was garnished with a sort of corn salsa that has a spicy kick to it, and it complimented the salmon very well.  My sunny side up pizza was a pizza with green onions, bacon, thinly-sliced and crisp fingerling potatoes, and two sunny-side up eggs.  Yummmm, even though it sounds like it should be brunch haha.  My actual pizza was a bit smaller in size than the pizzas my dad and sister received, and I guess the crust is their normal crust, which was cooked well and soft like bread when I bit in.  My whole family in general really enjoys a crisp crust when it comes to pizza, which is why my dad and sister went for thin-crust options.  Although the pizza looked quite crispy, when actually biting into it, they both noted that their respective pizza were sort of on the soft side, and probably because of too much oil on top.  A slight bummer, but the flavors were really good.  My dad's sicilian pizza was topped with spicy salami, sausage, pepperoni, and sliced basil.  It had really good flavor despite the lack of crunch.  My sister's pizza also had good flavor, but it was a bit on the heavy side because of all the pesto. We all didn't finish our respective meals because there was a lot of food, but we made sure to save room for dessert.  We asked our waitress for the dessert menu, and when she handed it to us, she highly recommended the salted caramel pudding with cookie bits.  I went for that, but my sister opted for the chocolate souffle cake with a scoop of ice cream.  The desserts came out fast, and we dug in.  My pudding was amazingly exquisitely.  The sweet caramel was balanced well by the salt, and then the soft texture of the pudding and whip cream on top was balanced by cripsy cookie bits at the bottom of the jar.  I really enjoyed this dessert and would recommend it to everyone!  My sister's souffle cake was decent, but we've had better before, and it's sort of a staple at a lot of restaurants, so it wasn't anything out of the extraordinary. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal here.  The price point is a bit high, but I mean it's Valley Fair, so it's understandable.  For both appetizers, I wish the portions could have been a bit bigger, but the entree and pizzas were all a good size for the price.  Good meal, and absolutely fantastic service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=100

Roberto Carlos ..,"San Francisco, CA",1,28,45,5.0,8/2/2014,"I used to wonder why a restaurant was always so busy. Was it due to the quality and selection of the food, the location, decore, lighting, ambiance, reputation, or even the chef, support staff, or management. I've come to realize, that after all is said and done, all of the above play an important role. As individuals, but especially more so, as customers, we tend to gravitate to the comfortable, to the better quality, to the individual needs and tastes we enjoy.  By that I mean, we can choose to frequent certain establishments or choose to play ""Dining Lottery"", at every occasion we eat out - especially in the Bay Area. We have no end of choices in the variety and selection of food in which we may partake. That being said, I would like to highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen, located at Westfield Mall Valley Fair. (As it can become quite busy, I recommend that you give yourself a few extra minutes to be seated. The wait time shall be justified, as I have alluded to above). We arrived just before 6 pm and were added to the waitlist. As David, at the reception area, took our names, he asked us our preference of seating location. We could be seated at booths, high tables, the bar, and even outdoors. Wow! How many restaurants have that many choices yet even offer the customer a choice as to where to sit! (Believe me, I've been in many restaurants and I have never been offered the pleasure of choice). We like David, so will you. Josh our host was a pleasant surprise and a welcome pleasure. He was very friendly, had a great smile, a great personality, a calm demeanor, and most importantly, as busy as it was at the restaurant for he and all the staff, he made us feel welcome. To me, that is going,"" Above and Beyond"". At a lot of establishments, they tend to make you feel like they are pushing cattle. Here at California Pizza Kitchen, we felt as if they had known us and were treating us as V.I.P.'s ! (On a side note, Josh offered to take our drink orders to help the wait staff.  It was crazy busy that night. I decided to play a little joke on Josh, and asked him for iced coffee. Without batting an eylash or skipping a heartbeat, Josh said that they did not carry iced coffee in the menu, but, they did have coffee, and they did have ice. He offered to bring them out with a creamer and he asked if that would be acceptable.  Holy cow!   Josh was on top of it! And as a matter of fact, we did order the iced coffee). That's what I call exceptional service. Thank you Josh. Another high point in our dining experience was our waiter, James. Once again I'd like to point out that it was quite busy. James came to our table offered to refresh our drinks drinks and gave us the menus. He pointed out that fresh bread was in the oven and he would bring it out shortly. After a while, James came back and took our orders. He noticed immediately that our ice water needed refreshing. (Without having to be asked). I call that, being ""Prescient"".  Pior experience at other establishments has proven that customers usually have to raise the waiter's attention in order to refill the water glasses. James was also very attentive, I noticed, to all his customers in his area. After delivery of our food, James made sure to stop by and ask if we needed anything else. Considering the wait for our food, James presented us with ice cream, free of charge. Quite admirable, thank you James.  As stated with Josh and David, James was  exceptional with a nice personality... Made us feel very special indeed. The food of course, at California Pizza Kitchen, is always fresh, tasty, crisp, warm, hot , cold, salty, sweet.., where and when appropriate.  They have an extensive menu, all of which are yummy. I make it a point to try something different each time I return. Sadly, I haven't been able to make it out too frequently..,but that will change. I'd also like to compliment the chef, the cooks, the other wait staff, and all the support staff necessary to keep California Pizza Kitchen running smoothly. *On a side note.* I had the pleasure of meeting Peter, the general manager. I noticed him walking around throughout the evening, checking on staff and visiting tables, speaking with customers. I caught Peter's attention and ask him to our table. I spoke to him about everything that I've written above, shook his hand and explained to him that we were highly impressed with his restaurant and his ability to pick staff and show them how to accommodate customer's needs, the California Pizza Kitchen way.  Peter was quite pleasant to talk to. Thank you Peter! I wish Peter and everyone at California Pizza Kitchen good health, prosperity, and happiness.  In life, as in all things, you deserve what you get, and receive what you put out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=100

I had to ask for extra dressing and it was still very bland. The pizza was just as bad. It came out messy looking with green peppers that looked like they were thrown on last minute (barely cooked onto the pizza). I think we were most disappointed with the service. Both dishes were just dropped at the table without asking if I needed condiments--fresh cracked pepper or parm & red pepper?? I had to wait a long time to ask for extra dressing.

She wasn't faking any interest in us and I liked that. you're going to get a good deal coming here for lunch but the killer is really the overpriced drinks. Iced tea especially unsweetened unflavored should be complimentary. Especially since it was gross and especially if no ones going to refill it. I would eat here again but it would only be if other people really wanted to go and I was giving in. I wouldn't seek it out on my own.

After explaining our situation, the hostesses (Crystal and Carly) at CPK were eager to help us out with no hesitation. We were seated within 5 minutes. They brought us warm bread and olive oil dip right away. Our waiter, Joneil, was amazing. He greeted us promptly and was totally happy to be serving us which is really great because most waiters are usually not excited to serve big parties. He always made sure our glasses were full and brought our food out in a reasonable amount of time. I got the shredded mushroom and spinach flat bread (exceptional) and had a couple bites of my friends meals and everything tasted pretty good. My friend wanted something off the old menu that they no longer served but he had the guys in the kitchen make it for her anyway (amazing!!!!). We had a couple more people join us later on in the night and he had no problem taking their orders. He even treated us to dessert!! It made our night and we couldn't be more grateful. He was even cool with splitting the tab which is usually our biggest challenge when we go out. At the end of the night he was kind enough to walk us to the door. I wish this was the experience I had every time I go out!!  Bottom line is you can't go wrong at this place.

Michelle S.,"Santa Clara, CA",76,35,11,3.0,2/28/2016,"I am giving 3 stars because I actually love the food when it's prepared correctly. Having said that, I am writing this review based on my last 4 encounters with CPK. First order was made through Door Dash. The Chicken tequila fettuccine was under cooked. The noodles were hard and there was no bread in the bag like I specifically asked for in the comments section of my door dash order. I called CPK directly and got the manager who said that she couldn't understand why the pasta was undercooked because it's cooked once during beginning of shift and then again when it's ordered. She did offer to send me a gift card for my bad experience. Once I got the gift card in the mail I ordered the same chicken tequila pasta twice. Both times I went into the restaurant to pick it up. Both times it was great just like I remembered. And both times they included bread in the bag like I had asked. Last night I ordered from Door Dash again. Mostly because the new parking situation at CPK valley fair is terrible. There is no longer spots for picking up your ToGO food. What do you know? Pasta came undercooked AGAIN and no bread and olive oil like I specifically asked. Not to mention the Door Dasher came 45 minutes late. (Which is a separate compliant I have made with DD). My conclusion? Door Dash orders at CPK do not get the same level of customer service as TOGO orders or restaurant patrons. Had I been sitting in the restaurant I would have sent the pasta back both times! The cooks need to check the pasta!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=180
M P.,"San Jose, CA",92,109,33,2.0,2/13/2012,"The only good thing about this restaurant is the service. My waiters/bartenders/hostesses have always been on task and friendly. The food... a whole different story. I only come here because I work in the mall and it's one of the only places I can relax and read a book while I get lunch. The food court is crazy loud. I've ordered variations of the same things hoping that the next would be better; macaroni and cheese, alfredo sauce w/ fusilli noodles, cheese pizza, and pepperoni pizza. All of these are $10+, and all of them are not that good.  Charging the amount of money they do for the food they provide is crazy. I honestly could get better food in the food court for less, but CPK is a much nicer atmosphere. First of all- the pastas. Horrible, they have the worst sauce(s) I have EVER had in a restaurant. It seems like they take 2 teaspoons of water, add some watery cheese, and drizzle it over your pasta. I uploaded a picture to show how gross it is. It all pools at the bottom of your plate- IT AIN'T CHEESE. I don't know what it is but they should be embarrassed to serve it. They even had the nerve to call the sauce in the picture ""creamy"". Dream on. Definitely won't be trying the pasta again... The pizza - mediocre. Maybe less than. I don't like the sweetness of the crust, the sauce is very very bland and they don't put much on, and the cheese is also bland. Maybe if you order a pizza with yummy toppings you might not notice the lack of quality- but if you are eating it plain or with one topping it truly does not taste good. And I adore pizza!

Kristi L.,"New York, NY",221,203,224,3.0,7/23/2012,"One thing about this place is that they give tiny ass portions for what you order. You know, normally when you order a pizza, it's big enough so that you couldn't finish it in one meal (unless you eat a lot, unlike me), but their pizzas are like as big as a regular plate. That is definitely not worth the $13 I put in when I could have went to Domino's and ordered a large pizza for $10.  But anyways, that's not the point. I came here with several friends I haven't seen in a while in a group of 10, and the wait time wasn't too bad on a Saturday night, around 20 minutes or so. By the way, CPK doesn't take reservations, so you have to wait if it's a crowded night. The service was decent, it wasn't so bad that it started annoying me, but it definitely wasn't great.  I ordered the white chicken garlic pizza and the small craving dish ""fried mac and cheese"" to share among three people including me, and boy, was I glad that I ate some food before I came here. The ""fried mac and cheese"", which I thought would be an actual dish, was actually 4 fried balls of clumped mac and cheese. And I finished the slices of the pizza within 3 minutes and still wasn't satisfied. I'm not complaining about the taste of the food though; it didn't seem too greasy like a lot of other pizza places I know.  But if you got money to blow, go for it. I'm probably not going to come back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=200

Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley Soup YUM! My party of 4 weren't that hungry so we didn't want to order more pizzas. We ended up going for a healthy soup and it was delicious! I really liked it, even though it kinda tasted a little like grass, pea soup. The pieces of barley really give it a bit more texture and chew since the rest of the soup is mushy. It wasn't too salty and had good pea flavor to it. Such a good surprise. The Works Little did I know that ""The Works"" is really just a combination pizza. This just goes to show you have descriptions can sometimes be a little tricky. It was still really good though. The toppings were solid and pretty fresh. The bread had a good crisp to it.  Jamaican Jerk Chicken It's nothing like Back A Yard's jerk chicken but it's still good. The thin crust went well with the saucey, BBQ-esque flavors. I was surprised that they didn't use mediocre chicken on their pizzas, as many franchise pizza places do. The chicken was decent. Everything was just a little bit on the salty and oily side.

As soon as we sat down a man came over and informed us that we were not to sit at the table and that the bar top was the only area for open seating. We told him we were informed that the tables were open seating. He again told us, no and that we shouldn't have sat ourselves. He then proceeded to tell the above mentioned server who yes we could sit at the bar tables that she shouldn't have told us that. The situation felt uncomfortable and uneasy.

My friends and I were deciding where to go for dinner and we decided to drive to Valley Fair. I for one did not want the food court, so I mentioned Cheesecake Factory and CPK. We ended up picking CPK as it was faster and cheaper as we are broke college students ballin on a budget.  We ended up ordering three pizzas which were the BBQ Chicken, Thai Peanut and The Meat Lovers pizza. The BBQ chicken is usually the go-to pizza if you don't know what to pick. It's usually not a bad choice. The pizza itself is not too sweet or tangy, and the chicken is pretty tender, unlike some other places.  The Thai Peanut on the other hand was a real trip. We decided to be adventurous so we ordered it as we all agreed that Thai Food is good so lets try it. It was... well It was interesting, it definitely was not bad. The pizza itself came with a sweet peanut sauce, kind of like peanut butter but less rich and creamy. The pizza is then topped with bean sprouts, carrots, cilantro, and peanuts. I could have done without the bean sprouts. The Meat Lovers Pizza is a thin crust pizza with lots of meat. The pizza is delicious, but it may get salty as you keep eating it. I also ordered a side of truffle oil since it goes well with some of their pizza.

Our food came it very quickly afterwards, but once she handed it over to our actual server, service slowed. We were thinking about desert, but our server just dropped our bill. Then waited too long to for him to come get the check as well as too long to get our card back.

We made a HUGE mistake- choosing the Cheesecake factory whom gave away our table twice. In the end, we were going to have to wait over 2 hours... no thanks.  Our large party of 17 called California Pizza Kitchen at a late hour (Thanks Cheesecake!) and we were told if we hurried we could get great seating. WOW did Cheesecake pull through! Crystal and Carly were able to seat us as soon as we arrived! We were seated in an area where a couple very large tables were put together for us. Our loud and boisterous group sat down, and we were introduced to JoNeil. JoNeil took our drink orders and didn't even mess them up. Normally, waiters are a little hesitant around our large group of girls- not JoNeil! We immediately felt at home and comfortable. We were able to talk and joke with him. When it came to food, JoNeil took all of our orders (again- no mess ups!) and even split all of our checks... something we're not used to at all with a group ranging from 10-20! Just when the night could not be any better, JoNeil surprised us with desert that he had bought for us! Was this real life? We were all treated the way people dream of in restaurants.  The food was awesome and the customer service was ABOVE and BEYOND!!

There's nothing especially wrong with the place.  The food is okay, servers are nice and the atmosphere is a little less hectic than the shoppers on steroids outside the door.  It's a small oasis...and I'd emphasize small rather than oasis...in one of the busiest centers in the US. The 2 young women in the greeting area were very nice and asked how they could accommodate our granddaughter and her stroller.  We left it by the door and sat in a quiet booth near the kitchen. The menu offers many choices, but you've got to wonder how a restaurant which focuses on pizza can do with salads, sandwiches and other unrelated entrees.  I guess well enough to keep the place full by 12 noon on a Wednesday. I had a ""5 cheese and tomato"" pizza which had plenty of dough for just $11.   Taste and texture seemed fine with the first slice, but as I mowed ( or chowed ) them down, the good feeling gradually flitted away.  It didn't age well.  The crust grew harder, the cheese became gooey and the tomatoes disappeared into the cheese.  By that last piece, eating was almost like a job.  I did it because I paid for the thing. My wife had the shrimp miso salad for $11.  While it didn't cause her to breathlessly exclaim ""that's the best I've ever had""...she said it was good enough to order again.  I tried some, but could only recommend it for people who just need something to chew.  Goats would love it. Our granddaughter ordered a bowl of pasta from the kids menu and gave it a thumbs up.  She was given a booklet and crayons with games and pictures which kept her ( and the new bear ) very occupied.  As my wife remarked ""it's nice to have a child friendly restaurant while shopping"". Value was respectable given the fairly large portions and reasonable prices...a nice thing to find among the upscale stores in Valley Fair.  Service was friendly and efficient. One special note.  CPK publishes a book with all sorts of interesting nutritional information on every item on the menu.  A great idea...even if you don't pay attention to your diet.  They hand it to all customers with the regular menu. If shopping makes you hungry, California Pizza Kitchen ( across from Starbucks ) offers a restaurant-like alternative to the food court on the 2nd floor. Personally, next time I'll be walking through the court. Pros:     Not bad food at reasonable prices.  Caters to kids (if you have them). Cons:    Nothing exceptional.  Provides temporary relief from crowds.  Caters to kids ( if you don't want to be near any ). Ratings: -   Overall:      3 -   Food Quality:       2 -   Food Quantity:     3 -   Service:     3 -   Menu:    3 -   Value:    3 -   Atmosphere:    3 -   Nutrition Book:   5 -   Kid Friendly:     4",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=220
Christina W.,"San Jose, CA",0,28,,3.0,4/12/2015,"Service was good, pizza was good, but the one item we usually enjoy at the restaurant has changed for the worse since our last visit three months ago. We usually get the garlic cream fettuccine.  Usually this is a white cream sauce with a nice garlic flavor.   We ordered it at our visit yesterday and the sauce was tan in color (not white) and had two or three big teaspoon-sized glops of a salty garlic paste amongst the pasta.   Waaaaaaaay too much garlic and salt.   My daughter (who typically enjoys this entrée beyond measure) only ate two bites.   None of us liked it.    I asked the waiter if the recipe had changed but he didn't know because he was new to the job.   If you look on the online menu on the CPK website, the sauce looks much like we are accustomed to receiving--with white sauce.    To the waiter's credit, he offered a different entrée but we declined since the rest of the party was finished eating.   When we received the check, we were at least happy to see that the cost of the entrée had been deducted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=220
Teresa U.,"Union City, CA",0,22,,5.0,4/19/2015,"I eat here when I am in the San Jose area. The reason is this place consistently has amazing salads! They are big, too and I need that.

Stephanie C.,"Redwood City, CA",4,363,5,4.0,4/16/2013,"Normally, I think I would give this place 3 stars, because while the pizza is tasty, it's not super amazing. For this particular location, however, I'm giving an extra star because of our waitress, who was super accommodating of my friend's toddler. She was really attentive and checked with us about bringing things out all at once or as things got finished (and apparently with a toddler, as it comes is generally better). That they seat the child-toting crowd in the back is also a plus (surprisingly not something I see as often as I should in restaurants)--when not in the company of children, I much prefer to be quite separate from them. We had the spinach artichoke dip (which doesn't have egg in it, yay!) and my friend got the pork wontons for herself and her kid. I very much liked the dip, and also enjoyed the pizza I had, which was the wild mushroom pizza with a whole wheat crust. The different crust gives it a nice rustic feel that I hadn't tried before, and I think that's probably the way I'll order my pizzas from CPK in the future. That their kids' menu had a mac & cheese with edamame was really useful, too (her kid loves edamame). I would pick this over the food court any day, for sure, and even if the crowded mall isn't the best seeming location, both the food and the service are good and that's the kind of thing that will bring me back again next time I'm hungry at the mall :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=220
Priscilla O.,"Cupertino, CA",111,301,37,2.0,8/20/2013,"I use to go to cpk often when reuniting with my old high school girlfriends. A couple months ago we decided to come back just for fun...and it was all bad. We sat down and ordered a couple drinks as well as some appetizers. They tell us that they cannot bring us any of the appetizers because they ran out of chips.  what. can you bring it out with bread instead?  nope.  ...so we didn't get any appetizers. We each got a salad instead. All of us when gazing upon our salad...look at the sad bed of lettuce with around 3-4 pieces of fruit and a sprinkling of cheese. :(  I came back to give this place another chance when finding they totally revamped the menu. I had a little bit of higher hopes...but...my expectations weren't met.  I got spaghetti cuz you can't go wrong with that...but it seemed to lack seasoning and my noodles were over cooked. The fried mac n cheese looked promising but came out dry and sauceless.  My brother enjoyed his alfredo and his girlfriend thought the mushroom pizza lacked something and wasn't what it use to be. We all shared another pizza to give it another go, but we all felt the same way about the second pizza. Their bbq chicken use to be one of my favorites, but it was bland this time around. I probably won't be coming here much anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=220
Ron L.,"San Jose, CA",541,553,39,3.0,9/12/2010,"CPK is the birthplace of the weird pizza types that sound weird, but they do work.  Who was bold enough to put barbecue chicken on pizza? They are branching out into bolder areas, like taking a cue from the taco truck craze and have introduced Korea BBQ steak tacos and quesadillas.  Pear and gorgonzola, roasted artichoke and spinach, and Thai chicken are some flavors that the out of the pizza box thinkers have concocted.  If you're looking for a pizza but tired of the same old pepperoni, this could be a good change for you.

My cousin and I decided to try it out for the first time today because we heard it was really good. Keep in mind we are pizza fanatics. We were obviously the youngest two in the restaurant at the time and from the minute we walked in we were treated differently. Our sever was TERRIBLE. I got a veggie pizza and tortilla soup. The soup was amazing but my pizza was made wrong. The server did not check up on us once and was irritated when I told him my pizza was not made to my request. Never came over to refill our drinks or even offer us cheese and pepper.

The spinach artichoke dip is yummy (we had a coupon for it, but usually it's a whopping $10), and their pizzas are good too (we tried the spinach artichoke and the 4 cheese and tomato). Their small salads are unique and flavorful, and my cousin LOVES the cheese ravioli. The servers are always super friendly.  I wouldn't eat here often though because the calorie count is SUPER HIGH.

Lanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",1427,675,2300,5.0,8/26/2010,"i posted pictures, but forgot to write a review? oopsies! I've been to this California Pizza Kitchen several times before. I only really remember my last experience which was in December '09. The wait was not terribly long. I was only with my boyfriend and depite it being holiday shopping/christmas whoring time, we had a table in about 10 minutes. The time also went by quicker as i had just built a bunny at the build-a-bear workshop and was busy dressing her up in the outfits i bought. (don't judge! why do kids get all the fun??) anywhoo, we sat down and i ordered the mushroom ravioli and bf ordered the Mediterranean tomato pizza or something similar. Pictures are posted. There's something about this place where the food always hits the right spot in your belly.  Not much else to say as it was an enjoyable meal and we had a pleasant waitress. Fast forward a couple months, I went vegan. Thinking I'd never be able to enjoy another meal at CPK, I was proven wrong. so wrong. California Pizza Kitchen GETS IT. They get that not everyone eats meat. they get that people have allergies. They get that people have religious beliefs that prohibit eating animals. They get that people want to eat healthy. They get that vegans exist. my mind=blown. A simple Google search shows me that CPK has a special menu where they list every VEGAN option, every LACTO-veg option, and LACTO-OVO veg option! CPK, i love you. thank you for thinking about your customers.

The meat itself tasted like it came out of a lunchables. The Veggie pizza was okay, set aside the overly thick slice of avocado that completely overpowered everything else that was on it.

She wasn't very nice, and said"" we'll, I can see chicken underneath the pasta"" there was like one sliver underneath.

When the unsmiling server brought the two needed tableware, she casually tossed them onto the table and disappeared for 10 minutes. We got up to leave without ordering. The manager knew he had upset customers, but was too busy on the phone to speak with or acknowledge me. In the end, this is a failure of management. Maybe it's important to memorize the over-extensive menu, but it's more important that staff is trained to make customers feel welcome and appreciated. And, if an employee doesn't like working at the California Pizza Kitchen, quit. Jeez! It's the service industry.  No thanks.

The lettuce was hella wilted, the chicken was gross, and the egg did not seem to be real egg. I couldn't even eat it...should have sent it back :-/ The only good part was the bacon, but it's hard to mess up bacon (though I must say Denny's has achieved that). Also, it said it had gorgonzola but it really tasted like bleu cheese, which I am not a fan of. Prices = too expensive Service = bad (our waiter didn't check in on us enough and we had a list of like 10 things we needed by the time she did. Also it sucks when you can't eat your food because you are waiting for some condiment to arrive). For some reason my salad got there like 5-10 mins after everyone else's pizza did. Shouldn't salad be faster to make than pizza? Also, I found it odd that they are so cheap on the bread. They gave us a couple tinyyyy slices of bread and some oil for our table, but no balsamic vinegar. We also had to ask for the bread in the first place, then ask for more when the tiny little slices were finished. Lol. Like really now... Restaurant = it is kind of loud in there and also pretty cold, but it's fine. I also found it very difficult to find something with a calorie count less than 800, even in the salad section. I don't want to be a total freak, but if I'm trying to eat somewhat healthy, I have to get a half portion salad with fat free dressing here to make it in a reasonable calorie range.

Even babies swing by this place to eat!  The average wait time for a table is 20-30 mins on a busy weekend. If you come during the weekday, there's hardly any wait time if any at all. The service is always good and the food always comes out hot and fresh. I usually order BBQ chicken pizza and the spinach dip with a side of pita bread. They charge me an extra dollar for the pita bread but it's totally worth it! I tried their new wedge salad my last time here and I liked it. Too bad I felt that it wasn't worth the $5 as I felt I could make this at home. They don't carry thousand island dressing, WTH!?!? What kind of restaurant doesn't offer that dressing? Anyway, that was just annoying. I'd have to say that their pastas (pending which ones you get) are average. I don't think it's their specialty so I wouldn't have high expectations. I'd stick to ordering the pizza or appetizers. My favorite drink here is the mango raspberry smoothie. It tastes so heavenly!!! Many of the girly foo-foo drinks are totally delish and the beer is good. Some of my friends like the wine here but they're not expecting a lot. Otherwise, I wouldn't come here for the bar. This sounds totally backwards to me especially since I'm a dessert fanatic but the desserts were way too sweet. I tried their apple cobbler thingy and there was wayyyyyy too much caramel on it.

I am like but I already paid for build a bear at build a bear and she is like no since you have patio its $10 per kid thats $4 more than kids menu.

Sean L.,"Berkeley, CA",334,199,1,3.0,8/22/2011,"*CAVEAT: Expect to wait 15-30 minutes on weekend lunches & dinners. The CPK, though its namesake suggests that its pizzas are the forte, actually has mediocre pizzas. You don't have the option to choose the size: it's just individual-sized. You get a hearty 6 to 7 slices, with the most basic cheese-only pizza costing $12. The prices of the pizzas are closely on-par with those offered by upper-scale pizza chains (Amici's comes to mind), but the quality is more close to that of Papa John's or Pizza Hut. Yes, it sounds strange, but stay away from ordering pizzas at California  -Pizza- Kitchen. Instead, opt for the good soup, salad, and pasta. Personally, I recommend the Jambalaya. Price is relatively high, but every bite of it is worth it. Not too salty or overwhelming - simply savory. The Minestrone Soup is also good. Salads are not extraordinary, but nevertheless a delightful addition to your meal.

Stine H.,"San Francisco, CA",201,478,198,3.0,3/16/2011,"As weird or not weird as this may sound...but there are a lot of American chain/franchise restaurants that I've never tried before (until recently) and CPK is one of them. I came here for lunch recently for the first time with David L. and his family and then another time shortly after. Both times I wasn't really wow'ed with the food, but I wasn't expecting it to be. Food is decent, the way it should be at a chain.  The small bite guacamole and chips were just that, nothing special. The asian lettuce wraps were pretty good, and the portion was big enough for our whole table to get one. Steak taco, I didn't like. The cabbage was too bitter and there were a measly 3 anorexic cubes of steak in each taco. It came with slices of avocado which I appreciated, but other than that I would skip it. The fish taco was also disappointing. It's not battered and fried, but grilled and seemed to have been grilled over old and burnt charcoal or something. The fish had a bad charcoal taste to it. I guess this is why it's called california PIZZA kitchen for a reason. Stick to the pizza. The second time I had the margherita pizza which was a lot better than the other items I've tried.

It's over-yeasted and leathery and flavorless and tastes no better than CPK's supermarket pizzas. The toppings aren't much better. They sound good individually, but it's the typical chain-restaurant approach of ""let's see how much stuff we can pile on regardless of whether it goes together"".

Fatty foods & fruity alcoholic beverages, why not?? Not gonna lie, the best part about this place... their drinks! For those of you who'd rather taste the sweet calorie juices of a drink rather than the alcohol, they have it all here! It seems as if they added a little more to the menu, especially for beverages. I got the cooler sunrise sangria and the bestie got the passion fruit mojito. These were both hands down the best drinks we've had... And we've had A TON of drinks in our time :) Onto food: My usuals have always been the chipotle chicken pizza or BBQ chicken salad. Whenever I come with my sister, I ALWAYS have to steal a slice of her tostada pizza. Super fresh! Totally a fan of the corn guacamole sides, except the tortilla chips are a little too salty for my liking.  Minus one star for not so attentive servers.

Kailey O.,"Campbell, CA",292,640,301,5.0,6/7/2009,"CPK has been my favorite restaurant since I was about 10 years old... that's a long time, so be aware of my bias. I come to the San Jose location about 2 times a month and either sit at a table or at the bar. Depending on the time of day and which day of the week you come, wait times can vary and may exceed 45 minutes. The bread that you receive before you meal comes is horrible quality. I remember when it used to be real bread and not so processed. Other than that, the service is always great, but I have noticed an increase in the prices over the years. Thank goodness for the customer surveys on the bills that automatically let you win a free appetizer or desert with the purchase of an entree. Also, recently CPK is having this amazing promotion where you receive a coupon for something that cannot be revealed until the next time you dine there. I have gotten 10 - 20 percent off of my meals throughout these last 2 months! Combine this with a free appetizer coupon and you're set. My new obsession is the grilled vegetable salad. I love the combination of avocados, sun dried tomatoes, flavorful asparagus, eggplant, and a nice balsamic vinaigrette. I always feel healthier for some reason when i order this salad, even though I'm sure it's just the same as all the others. The pizza, as always, is amazing- no matter which one you choose.

I ordered a vegetarian pizza with Japanese eggplant and damn it was like the healthiest pizza on Earth. It has marinara sauce, cheese, broccolini, red onions, mushrooms, and eggplant. The waitress even asked me if I wanted to substitute for wheat dough bread like ughhhh no why try and make it even healthier! This place doesn't even give you bread and butter as an appetizer. My friend got pasta and it looked kinda plain and it didn't even cinematic garlic bread! The waitress was like catering to a million tables, so when we asked for a coke and ranch it took five minutes and the manager had to personally deliver it to our table. So if you want something make sure you order it right away!  I wouldnt come here again and pay 12 bucks for a mediocre pizza, just go to a small pizza shop and get your pizza fix.

CPK has unique creations with lots of selections and choices.  Their pizza is about a 6 on a scale of 10.  Very middle of the road.  If it were just plain pizza it would be pretty bland, but they mask it with all sorts of toppings and unique combinations of toppings/sauces/dressing and make it different. I personally do not care at all for their pasta - I tried 2 or 3 of them and definitely did not like them.  They have good apps and good salads (huge) but you pay for what you get.   Great bar selection and desert selection as well!

Salads, pasta and pizza are amazing. It's a pretty difficult choice to make. Now they also have a small bites menu which looks good too. My favorite salad by far is the BBQ chicken chopped salad. Their ranch dressing is so good I always ask for more. My two favorite pastas are the fettucini alfredo with chicken and the kung pao spaghetti with shrimp. I wish I didn't love their Thai Chicken and BBQ Chicken pizza so much so that I had the desire to try their other pizzas. Parking at this mall is a pain though!

Great guest service :) ...  smiles, yes!, the hostess at the front seemed a little overwhelm, and I saw.... the chef? I guess, he was using the white uniform for the cooks, seating people... that was pretty cool .... Food :) ... food is food :) yummy! consistency! yes! :) if you have been at cpk, you know what to expect and my food was exactly what I was expecting... the only recommendation would be give a little more bread ;) , it will save the server two trips ... Cleanliness... :) they were trying to keep the place as clean as possible... I saw literally everyone cleaning! and that was great! they were cleaning the carpet every time someone left and of course the tables too... that was pretty cool ....

My friends and I always ordered BBQ chicken pizza, and the Thai Crunch salad is actually really good. I -1 star because it can get REALLY BUSY. You'd have to wait for hours to get a seat during peak lunch/dinner hours. Which is why I always go around 11:30am or 5:30pm, but that's kind of a bummer lol. Makes me feel like an old lady hahaha. Anyway, its a good place to go, the drinks are good, and the food is satisfying.

I also ordered a peach italian soda and that was yummy! Free refills too! I mustve had 3 refills for only $2.99! For my meal I ordered the Thai linguini. Unfortunately, it wasnt good at all. Too much Peanut flavored sauce.. And it just didn't taste right.. I barely ate any of it and ended up packing it to-go. My Bf ordered the Sicilian pizza and that was pretty good.

My girlfriends and I were doing some shopping in Valley Fair and didn't want to eat at the food court and CPK we thought was a good chain to go that will have foods that we all want.  I feel like they attempt to be healthier with the thin crusts pizza and the many choices for salads.  I haven't been here for awhile so I was excited to see the Small Cravings menu!  Its like a kids or happy hour menu or something. I got the Asparagus and Arugula salad off of that.  So good and good size for 4.99.  I wasn't looking to eat a whole lot.  The service was quick once we sat down which is nice.  I always love seeing where the waiter/waitresses are from with their name tag.  We got Joey from Hayward.

They also take great care in dealing with special requests (all you no meat/allergic to nuts/hate onions people out there should be so lucky as to eat here.)

It was my husbands bday and wanted to go CPK so we did. 1st issue - They said the wait was about 15 mins and the next thing you know it was 30 mins and just a few more minutes then it was 45. There were people who came after us that sat first. We were about ready to leave when they finally said the table was ready. 2nd - YAY! We're seated and finally ordered our drinks and food. Server was nice and got everything pretty quick. 3rd - Food came, not everything came. A few at a time which we didn't care much about. Problem was we didn't have any utensils or plates since we all decided to order food to share. We tried to get plates and utensils to no avail. It's like people just kept forgetting. 4th - Next thing you know a pizza that we ordered went to the next tabel. The lady grabbed a slice and almost put it in her mouth as she kept yapping all over the pizza. The guy comes back right before she took a bite and she placed the slice back on the plate. The guy takes it back and tells the mgr (we don't know what he said) the next thing you know he was heading back to our table and gave us the pizza. I said we weren'tgoing to accept the pizza since the lady already touched it and almost took a bite. This RUDE dingbat decides to ignore us and left tje pizza at our table. 5th - Our server finally came back and told her what happened.

The service was not the only thing that was wrong, the cooks were soooo cheaping out on the food.  Okay, so the waitress seems nice at first, but she did not offer us any bread, and forgot to give us water.  To top it off, the food did not get to for 20 min after we ordered, and we were seating there with no water and bread... I was super thirsty from walking around the mall, so I ask one of the other servers to please get us some water.  The server looked around dum-found, ""oh okay...""

I felt so bad for him, it literally cracked when he would take a bite.  My salad appeared to have no asparagus on it.  The salad usually had visible pieces of asparagus, and I did not see any.  I asked the server, ""is there asparagus on my salad?"" She replied, ""that's weird I don't see any either."" So she leaves.  We continue to eat this with really sad faces.  The server comes back with this tiny little plate (like the ones you put soy sauce in), and says, ""here you go.""  I was speechless,  she handed me this puny little plate with a mediocre amount of MINCED, yes, MINCED asparagus.  I was like, "" W-T-F...?!""  I had MINCED asparagus on my grilled vegetable salad!  Are you fucking kidding me? That is, like, one fucking spear of asparagus, minced to make it look like you gave me asparagus in my dish!  Usually they give a nice amount of big asparagus.

Nora R.,"Los Gatos, CA",70,82,20,1.0,8/26/2011,"CPK needs CPR. I used to really enjoy coming here, despite the crowds, etc.  But, sadly, CPK has gone the way of so many chains, i.e. they are not really cooking so much as following a formula which is designed to maximize profit at the expense of providing a good meal. I ordered the ""BLT salad"" pizza (thin crust) and my daughter ordered the Greek Salad pizza.  My salad arrived with nearly no cheese, overcooked and with roughly the equivalent of 1 slice of bacon distributed in teeny-tiny bits over the pizza.  There was like a little crumb of bacon on each slice--you could barely see it.  So it was more ""LT"" than ""BLT""  and frankly, they were chintzy with the L and T too. My daughter's pizza was a bit more abundant--and yet only had about 3 olives. On a ""Greek Salad"" pizza.  ??? My daughter said ""this is not right"" and asked the waiter for some more olives.  Inspired by her courage (I hate to complain in restaurants so I was just going to eat my pizza in a sullen silence) I did the same.  The waiter (who was very nice, a lone bright spot in this calamity) brought out little bowls for us.  Mine was cold as ice but-- oh well. The pizza itself was ""meh"" at best. Crust not so much chewy as leathery and tough and not much flavor.  But wait--it gets worse. We geo the bill and discover that we were CHARGED for the extra olives and bacon.  Can you believe it?  It's not the money, it was a crummy extra $2.00 but geez, talk about nickel and diming.  We wrote a very strong note to the management, took our purses and left.  For good.  To CPK I say: C U Later.  Much, MUCH later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=320

I have been here several times before. This time was horrendously different. Once we had ordered our food, that was basically the last time we saw our waitress again. The manager brung us our food. My boyfriend asked him for Parmesan and he never came back with it. Our so called waitress happened to be passing by our table after a good ten minutes, so we ask her for some Parmesan. She brings us a practically empty shaker with little balls of Parmesan cheese in it. It didn't even come out. We could not even ask for another bottle because she never came back.  This whole time my glass is also empty she doesn't even bother to come by to ask me if I want a refill or not. Not to even check how we are doing or if we need anything. At this point both my boyfriend and I were so furious we wanted to pay the bill and leave.  She comes back after about a good 25 min's, and we just plain and blatantly told her we wanted to speak to her manager. The manager comes to our table after 5 Min's. Just stands there, he doesn't say anything at all. Does not say he is a manager or even ask us whats wrong. We had to start the whole conversation. He seemed very ignorant himself. We even told him we asked you for the Parmesan cheese and you never came back with it. He didn't say anything. He just shook his head, like yeah ok.  He didn't charge us for anything and apologized. I was so mad. I was actually furious. This waitress made us feel invisible. As if we were not there. She paid us no mind and never acknowledged us. I never felt so disrespected and humiliated in any restaurant, she ruined my night, which was going pretty well up until then. After this experience I will never set foot in that place again.

Michelle C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,37,5,2.0,9/15/2012,"I was at Valley Fair today shopping with my 10 year old and lunchtime came around.  We usually choose to eat at CPK, so we went in.  It was 11:30am, and the restaurant was half empty.  There was one large and loud party.  The host seated us next to them.  After about 2 minutes, we were desperate to move, but no one came by, and by the time a server turned up, the rest of the tables had filled up.  So we were stuck with the braying ladies.   The menu has changed recently, and some of our favorites have disappeared (no more BLT pizza or goats cheese and roasted peppers) but then its probably good to be forced to try some different dishes.  The food is very consistent, no complaints. What was TERRIBLE was the music.  Too loud, too heavy in the base.  Thumpity thumpity thum.  That, together with the hum of ambient chat (and the braying ladies one foot away from us) made the whole experience really oppressive.  My daughter literally sat there with her hands over her ears.  I could not hear what the server was asking, and she misheard my order twice when I was ordering.  At the end of the meal, I felt moved to write ""Please turn your music down!"" on the credit card slip.

Very pleasing to the palette. =) If you're not digging that, there are TONS of other kinds of pizzas to choose from. And of course there are you basic meat and cheese pizzas for you unadventurous *cough*and boring*cough* types. =)  For those searching for something a little healthier, their salads are pretty good. Yep, they've got more than just Ceasar! They definitely don't skimp on the goods either. There's more stuff other than lettuce leaves. The full sized salads are pretty huge. Luckily, you can order a half order. The appetizers aren't bad either. Chicken lettuce wraps are my favorite. =) They do have other entrees (that involve using a fork) like pasta and fish dishes but it seems best to avoid these ones. I mean, you are at a PIZZA place.

Decided to come here with the bf and my brother while shopping around at Valley Fair Mall, not wanting to deal with the traffic of leaving the parking lots. First of, the wait was crazy long! Probably due to the fact that there were many people waiting to be seated and the mall was extremely packed today because of the whole fashion show with the celebrity stylist from Project Runaway. Either way, the host told us the wait would be about 20 minutes...I could've sworn it took at least 50 minutes which is why I bumped off a star. When we were finally seated, centuries later, we started off by ordering the spinach and artichoke dip with chips which is an ultimate classic for appetizers. No matter where you go to order it, it tastes almost exactly the same wherever you go. Whether it be BJ's, Chili's, AppleBees, etc. The appetizer truly was scrumptious and creamy. We ordered three different types of pizza: the bbq chicken pizza, the garlic chicken pizza, and the margarita pizza.  All in all, I'd say all three of the pizzas were equally good, but since I'm a chicken and garlic lover, my favorite out of the three was the garlic chicken pizza. I really like how CPK's pizzas' crusts are all fairly thin and not too greasy as your average Pizza Hut or RoundTable. Not a bad place to come to for pizza, but then again not my absolute favorite.

Honestly, I didn't even know they offer kid's birthday party until I saw the tiny little flyer hanging outside their restroom. In short, the party started an hour before the restaurant opens, which was nice because we literally had the entire restaurants to ourselves. The kids were given a tour in the kitchen and its industrial walk-in fridge. Then the kids got to make their own pizza. By this time, the restaurant opened for lunch, so parents ordered food while the kids ate their own creations. After cake time, each kid was given a pencil and a coupon for a free kid's meal. The birthday kid gets a monogrammed chef coat.  A shout-out to the staff there, especially the manager Daniel and our server, Marla. Originally our party was set up at the patio. Since it was still early and the torch didn't warm up the place fast enough, Daniel asked his staff to move the party indoor. Some of the kids showed up late. Daniel was nice enough to offer a tour to the already excited kids and another one when more kids showed up. We had one guest who showed up 45 minutes late. I was about to tell her to order a kids meal since the rest were already eating until Marla offered her a personal tour and helped her with a personal pizza. I've got to admit some of the kids were not in their best behavior and literally trashed the space, and we were just so grateful for the staff's patience. At the end, we were even offered two pizzas to take home (I'm guessing they were from the extra two dough they had for the guests who didn't show up).  $10/kid is not bad at all, given the free kid's meal coupon is worth $6.

I find the service inconsistent and not helpful most of the time. On busy weekends, I understand there are a lot of customers to get to. I understand this because I was a server myself but I know how to manage my tables. Usually servers have 4 tables max. On a weekend, I had to handle 8 tables and I easily handled them with ease. But this location had a hard time. This past Friday we were seated and were waiting quite a long time to order our food. After receiving our food our server came up to us to let us know that she was taking a break. She introduced us to another server who would be taking care of us. He only visited us once and asked us how everything was. There were dirty plates on our table and yet he just left it there. We waited and waited to get a To-Go box for our pizza and he constantly stared at us but never came up to us and ask us. Finally, he did. Overall, the environment was great.

However this one (and especially tonight) wasn't the greatest. I went there with a group. For starters, the waiter didn't come around until 10 minutes after the entire party had been siting at the table. And when he came around, it wasn't as though he acknowledged that we'd been waiting for him. We ordered everything at once given the unfortunate omen we had already experienced. When the food came, one dish had remenants of another dish (who knows what it was, but it wasn't what was ordered.) Unfortunately our waiter didn't make it a habit to come around and check on us so I had to get up and literally walk to the kitchen and show someone. They promptly apologized. Shortly there after, a new dish came out. Unfortunately, it too again had remenants of another dish. CPK is EXTREMELY lucky it wasn't peanuts or something like that they accidently left behind because nowadays that could be fatal for kids!!! I call this type of service and quality extremely sloppy and poor. So, not only was the dish effectively ruined, but everyone else at the table had their food.

Frances Lois B.,"San Jose, CA",262,34,35,3.0,5/26/2011,"This place is my go-to place every time I crave pizza or am grabbing a quick bite to eat with friends and/or family. I would say I've had both a negative and positive experience here. Some days good, some days bad.  Service: Service is ok, but could definitely be better. Management is pretty good at making up for the loss of service from their kitchen staff and servers though. I came here one day with my sister and our server was non-existent because she had a party of over 20+ people sitting outdoors. Big party = big gratuity. So obviously, she was more focus on that. It seriously took her/the kitchen staff 30+ minutes to finally give us our order, and by that time we were already ready to leave. I guess our server must have overheard me complain to my sister privately that it doesn't take more than 15 minutes, even when it's busy, to serve someone's food after they have ordered because the manager approached us to apologize and gave our meal for free. Overall, I know that they're busy, but it seems like they serve some customers better than others because there were also times when people that arrived later than us would always receive their food first even though our orders were simpler.  Food: I usually get the same foods: Club Sandwich, BBQ Pizza, Margherita Pizza, Spinach Dip, and the Lettuce Wraps. Everything on this list is pretty delicious, but the deliciousness of the Margherita pizza varies. Same with their mixed drinks, sometimes their mojitos are good and sometimes they are just too watered down. It seems like they are better with wine.  Price: Of course, this place is pricey, but I guess you could say it kind of lives up to its potential.

Julie W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",10,42,13,4.0,6/7/2011,"This is my kids favorite pizza place, not that they necessarily eat pizza.  My 5 year old loves the curly mac & cheese ($5.49 and comes with a kids drink)  My 11 year old loves the honey chicken pizza with tomato sauce. My husband and I usually share a Sicilian Pizza, thin crust with Italian meat.  One item is not enough, so we need to get something else, like a pasta dish or another pizza to share.  We tried most of the appetizers and they are much better at Cheesecake factory, so we usually do not order any here.  The salads were ok but the ingredients were bite size, like in the chopped salad, but I guess that would be expected.  We like the Greek pizza, but we ask for more tzatziki sauce and avocado instead of chicken. We've found the chicken can be dried out being cooked on top of the pizza and they are cut small.  The BLT is good if you like bacon and mayo.  The pesto cream penne is good too.  We kind of all share it like a side dish. There wasn't enough raviolis to share, so that was not a good choice for us.  My sister likes the kung pao chicken.  I like the mango ice tea.  You need to ask for bread and butter.  They do not bring it unless you ask.  Kids sundaes for the kids is 99 cents.  It's vanilla ice cream with some fudge sauce, whip cream, and mini m&ms.  The butter cake ala mode is really good.  It's warm in the middle with crunchy sugary edges.  Once it was really cold and they brought us another one. Service is usually nice.  We've tried the CPK in Hillsdale, Anaheim, Fresno, and Oahu.  They are pretty consistent. We try to go before the lunch/dinner crowd, like 11:45 or 5:30 and there usually isn't a wait or later, like 2 or 7 pm.  Prices vary in the tourist locations.  Vegas does not have a kids menu.  Do not confuse the express with the Restaurant.  At the express, you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  Servings seem to be smaller there and drinks are self-serve, but basically the same taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=460

Well, here's my two cents on CPK in general: I am not a fan of their pizza. I don't know why people rave about it being one of their most favorite pizza places. Now I am not a food snob, nor am I picky with what foods I eat but this pizza was just okay which is why I am giving them a two star rating. Yes, I have definitely had better. I don't know, perhaps its suppose to be healthier pizza? I've had Papa Murphy's, I've had Round Table, I've had Costco and Sam's Club, Pizza My Heart, THAT is real pizza in my opinion. Am I wrong? Maybe? I don't want to sound fat and unhealthy but their pizza, its not pizza IMO. By the way, the times I have come here I have ordered the Italian, Tomato and Basil, and Roasted Garlic Chicken and Pesto Cream Penne (Their pasta serving was not too generous IMO). So to end, I give CPK a 2 out of 5 stars. Maybe I am not adventurous enough? Then again I've seen different pizza creations else where which taste much better in my opinion.

Anyways besides the fact that I think its totally cool that the owners used to be lawyers, the foods pretty awesome as well. My main staples are the singapore rolls, the kung pao noodles, the jambalaya, the bbq pizza and the field greens salad.

I don't remember what it's called and it's been taken off their menu. However, my first thought was, ""eww...gross!"" Since I'm not an onion lover / eater and the though of pear on a pizza just didn't sound appetizing, I was hesistant on how it would taste. To my surprise, it was actually edible (being a picky eater). It was definitely not a dish I would order again, but I must say it was good. My favorite dish at CPK is the Kung Pao Spaghetti. I love noodles and the taste is great. I've also had the Thai Chicken, Wild Mushroom, and the Mango Tandoori Chicken.

Katie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",163,407,338,4.0,2/11/2010,"Yelpers that read my reviews know that I love pizza. If it's New York Style, regular style or CPK style I have my opinions and I have my favorites. SO I a may be the odd one out of the bunch, but my favorite pizza is and always will be CPK. Well, let's just say I haven't tried Chicago style yet. But, CPK is pretty much up there. I love everything about CPK and there is no pizza that I have tried that has beaten CPK in my ranking scale.  The usual CPK that I go to is the Valley Fair one, which is crowed on weekends, rarely during lunch and week days are okay. The Oakridge one is nicer, but further from me. I went to the San Luis Obispo one which is HUGE. All the food is consistent and fantastic. Now that i live in New York, I have VERY VERY VERY happy that there are a couple in Manhattan. I love it.  Anyways on to the food reviews. Starting with appetizers. You have to ask for bread (which is free) if you want some. The bread is cold and chewy and not good. I do not recommend you ask for it. It's just filler. DON'T DO IT... If you want something to start off the meal, try the Singapore shrimp rolls, YUM or the spinach artichoke dip.  The pizzas are just plain delicious. On very rare occasions do I finish the whole pizza, only when I have starved myself the whole day. You can sub the crust for whole wheat dough. Healthier and even more delicious in my opinion. I almost tried all the pizzas on the menu. My favorite is the Jamaican Jerk chicken. Tangy, spicy and yummy. SO GOOD. The originals that most people order is the garlic shrimp or chicken and the BBQ chicken. Those are the most popular and they are very good as well. I tried the Thai pizza it was odd. Bean sprouts and peanut flavored sauces. It didn't  seen right on the pizza. If you're looking for a lighter choice, the mushroom pizza is my favorite when I'm looking for something healthy. If you want a thin crusted pizza, you should get the pesto chicken. My second favorite! So YUMMY IN MY TUMMY! I recommend any type of pizza, you won't be disappointed with any of them.  Moving on to the pasta. The mushroom ravioli is FANTASTIC (notice I love mushrooms?) The garlic cream fettuccine with mushrooms and chicken is the BEST I ever had (ironic because this restaurant is mainly for pizza). There hasn't been another place with better fettuccine. The pesto cream penne is GREAT with the sundried tomatoes. SO GOOD. I have also tried the Asparagus & Spinach Spaghettini with shrimp. It was very light and healthy. I liked it a lot. Other pasta dishes I had were the Thai Linguini and Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. Both were just okay, I wouldn't order them again.  Moving on to desserts... My favorite is the red velvet cake. It was so moist and delicious. It's the best you will get in San Jose. You MUST tr it. The Apple Crisp is very good as well. The Sundaes are just like any other. And their cheesecake is just okay. Lastly, the drinks here. I ALWAYS, ALWAYS order the raspberry iced tea and drink about 4 cups through the meal. Free refills and it's my favorite. You can't get that kind of raspberry iced tea anywhere else. It isn't just from a soda machine... NO it is MADE. So good. Okay, well now I'm hungry after going through a three course meal, BUT I highly recommend this place to EVERYONE! Great for groups, families, kids and just friends. This is my favorite restaurant and it's decent priced! Love it...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=540

Albert C.,"Newark, CA",11,14,,5.0,6/1/2007,"CPK, one of the best pizza restaurants out there.  I don't understand why people knock it because it's a chain restaurant. Their appetizers are wonderful!  Go ahead and try their Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings.  They're delicious! They have a great selection of pizzas to please any appetite.  My favorites are the original Thai Chicken pizza, and their Chipotle Chicken Pizza.    My wife loves their salads too, which are surprisingly good, and also very fresh, (the avocados in her salad weren't brown, and it was tossed for her already!).   If you're not in the mood for pizza, try some of their pastas, those are also very good.  The pasta compliment to their Thai Chicken Pizza, the Thai Linguini, is VERY tasty!  That's my favorite dish there! Their kids menu is also very good, they'll compliment whatever your kids desire to eat.  Although it says Fusilli (curly pasta) with meat sauce or cheese or whatever, you can substitute the fusilli for any kind of pasta (spaghetti, angel hair, linguini).  That's wonderful for kids (especially my daughter who doesn't' like curly things.....). Their table service is always on top of things.  The second I finish my Raspberry Lemonade, the server is already bringing me a new glass, filled with some more yummy goodness!  It's like their waiting in the shadows for me to finish my drink!   This place is great for groups, but expect to wait a bit longer until they can get the tables ready for you.   The ambiance of this restaurant inside the mall is great.  I've never had a problem here, and the food has always come out in a timely manner.   This place is where my family goes for lunch, every time we're in Valley Fair.  It's great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=540

In fact, one time, when we ate there instead of getting curbside to-go (my M.O. about 70% of the time), we were brought our apps and our main course at the same time. As we wanted to savor our appetizers before dinner, the waitress realized that the kitchen had made an error, and brought us a free dessert after our meal (which was amazing!). The manager also came and apologized and was very sincere in his desire to set things right. It wasn't even that big of a deal, but we appreciated that they didn't act like it wasn't. They made it seem like it was below their standards and wanted to do better. We liked that. Also, we've eaten here at this location at least 15 times and they have never messed up our orders once. That's a pretty good track record considering I always have exceptions to my salad order like a different dressing and no tomatoes!

I have a sweet tooth and their Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza satisfies that. I actually first tasted it from their frozen food line. It has a mildly spicy sweet sauce, chicken, bacon, onions, bell peppers. The sauce really gets me. I heart it too much! The only thing i can think is wrong with the pizza is the dough can seem a little undercooked but i get past that love my pizza just fine.  Other things I've tried are starters such as the lettuce wraps and the pita slices with hummus dip. Theyre both delicious.  I love their array of lemonades and italian sodas. Can't find it at other restaurants. My friend tried the kiwi lemonade and liked it. I personally am all about peach flavored drinks. The velvet cake is a must for dessert. I've had better velvet cake before but their velvet cake is not bad at all. I get it everytime i go. The pricing is not bad at all pretty standard dining prices that wont hurt your wallet too bad. Service is pretty average.  Random Note: If you like bread, new corporate policy is they wont give you bread unless you request it.

I don't think you can really go wrong with the food here. You'll definitely pay for it though.  Also there's something about the restaurant that is a little strange.

It's a nice place to stop and rest your footsies after a long day of shopping. I've tried: - Cherry Limeade (5/5 stars)... I'm normally not a cherry limeade person, but my server convinced me to try it. It was good and made fresh to order. It has more of a soda taste to it than lemonade, which might be the reason why I liked it as much as I did (but who knows). - BBQ Chicken Pizza (3/5 stars)... This is supposedly one of their best sellers. I thought it was OK  - Avocado Club Egg Rolls (5/5 stars)... a MUST-GET if you choose to get an appetizer. SO good especially with that ranchito sauce. - Spinach Artichoke Dip (5/5 stars)... who DOESN'T like this?! Another good appetizer to share.  - Garlic Cream Fettuccine w/ chicken (2.5/5 stars)... while this was edible, it was something I felt that I could have made much better myself at home. It was lacking something in flavor. It was a VERY small portion too! - Thai Linguine (1.5/5 stars)... Take this with a grain of salt. I only sampled a bit from my friend's plate. I'm not a fan of peanut butter in my food (unless it's dessert) so I may be a bit prejudiced. My friend enjoys it so much that she normally orders it whenever she dines here.

L L.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/17/2011,"Here is some information for further yelp customers at California Pizza Kitchen Valley Fair. I used to be a server at this location and I feel that I have some useful tidbits that may make your next visit more enjoyable.  #1) WE DO NOT OFFER BREAD. BREAD IS SERVED ON REQUEST ONLY! For some reason, people get all bent out of shape about this. Several years ago CPK implemented a policy that we will no longer automatically bring bread to customers. People complain about waste - well that was exactly what we were doing when we brought bread out to people who didn't want it. If you see another table getting bread, it is because they asked their server in a polite manner, with a ""please"" and a ""thank - you"" (in a perfect world) if they could have bread when they placed their order. No, they are not a horrible server for not bringing you FREE bread. Also, we do not automatically bring water out either. #2) BREAD IS SERVED ROOM TEMPERATURE It is not supposed to be served hot. And there should only be enough pieces of bread for however many people are in your party - plus one extra. Let's do the math - 2 people in your party = 3 pieces of bread. So to recap, servers are not denying you bread by bringing a few pieces at a time. And while we're on the subject - seriously, don't come to a restaurant and split a small salad between four people but ask for 6 plates of bread. Think about this. #3) PORTION SIZES AT A CORPORATE RESTAURANT ARE MEASURED VERY PRECISELY! I notice several people complaining about not getting enough ""whatever"" on their salad, pizza, or pasta. Unfortunately, this is out of a server's control. And many times out of the control of the person making your food as well. I think you really have to be a server to understand this, but we really can't go to the back of the salad station and throw some extra asparagus on our salad because the portion size looks small. CPK is very corporate, which trust me, I was not a fan of. But because of that , their goal is to make the food the same EVERY TIME. As far as portion goes, would you believe that they actually count the number of chicken on your pizza? They do.  Sure, the kitchen makes mistakes and can leave out an ingredient. If this happens, please let your server know BEFORE you log on to Yelp and complain about it. Also, if you're not happy with the portion, please tell your server. Don't just sulk at your table like a five-year-old. They will be happy to help you out. BUT, and this is a big one, they are NOT going to bring you a huge bowl size of MORE tomatoes and then another huge bowl size of MORE candied walnuts without charging. Let's be rational here! 4) BE PATIENT WITH YOUR SERVER, AND THEY WILL BE PATIENT WITH YOU I will admit, being a server is not easy, especially at this location. People spend their day shopping and then realize they're starving. Then they're told they have to wait 30 minutes for their table. By the time they are seated, their server simply can't get to them fast enough. I don't know about you, but if I'm starving to the point that I've turned into the worst version of myself, I decide to opt out of the restaurant with the 30 minute wait.   Makes sense right? Especially when there is a food court upstairs!   I guess that's the joys of working for a mall.  Server's here work really hard. They have other customers. You are not the only one, believe it or not. BE PATIENT. BE KIND. 5) STANDARD TIP is 18% - 20% Why do people at this CPK think that an 8% tip is efficient? Servers at this location have to put up with ALOT of horrible tips that in my mind, verge on the line of being disrespectful. One of the reasons I'm not there anymore. Think about when you work your job? How would you feel if your boss came in and said ""Today, we are decreasing your pay by $10 an hour. You'll still do the same work though."" This is basically what is being done when you leave your server a bad tip, because in a restaurant scenario, YOU ARE THE BOSS. If you're server has an attitude, which is my pet peeve, then by all means reduce their tip. But also look at how you've treated the server throughout the meal. Have you treated them like you would want your son, daughter, mother, or father treated if they were a server? Sometimes the attitude is a defense mechanism, because they feel they are being looked down upon and treated unfairly. Remember, servers will give you the best customer service we can, but to stare at us like we're idiots if we forget to bring something (out of all the requests we are getting at one time) is slightly unreasonable. My advice - what you put into your experience is what you will get out of it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=520

Iris X.,"Fremont, CA",2,31,18,3.0,8/22/2010,"Went here for lunch one day, and it's been a pretty long time since I've been back to this place. Decided to try out one of their new 'small plates' - and they ARE small plates! I love fried artichoke hearts, but theirs is 1/4th the size and the same price as the Cheesecake Factory ones! They split like three artichoke hearts into fourths and deep fry them, just to save on cost, so it was really skimpy and not satisfying at all. The remoulade was really flavorful though, so that was a plus. We ordered the Chipotle Chicken, and the California Club pizzas. Honestly, the Chipotle chicken is really good, because it does taste like Chipotle (the burrito place) on a pizza, and California Club has a huge slice of avocado on EACH piece of the pizza, with plenty of bacon and chicken. Ask to hold off on the mayo for the salad on top though, it is unnecessary and adds extra calories. Crust was thin, although it's a bit sweet for those who are used to New York-style pizzas. It blends well with the ""untraditional"" pizza flavors though. However, it was expensive, since each of the better-flavored pizzas cost around $12.79, so I would only come here if you're in the mood for pizzas that taste like something else, but it's a fair place. However, the service is another story.. Our waitress was the Asian one in the ponytail, and while in the beginning she was nice, she later on neglected to refill our water, and quickly shoved the check onto our table, without even asking if we were done eating yet. I found that to be quite rude - part of common service etiquette is that you ask a) how they are first b) come back in 5 minutes once they totally clean off their plates and have chatted for a good few minutes.

I still can't describe how good it was today, maybe it was my one meal a day thing where it heighten my tastebuds but this dish tasted like a creamy pad thai lime flavor pasta.

Yes, I put BBQ/Sriracha in my spaghetti, don't hate!

Waited 20 min for a ""table"", which was one of those mini booths for 2 people.  I hate those - they should be outlawed!  There is never enough space for 2 plates and drinks and bread.  It was crowded and very noisy in there. Took our drink order right away - nice.  We ordered our pizzas.  I got the Thai Chicken, which is one of their specialties and my favorite - no problem.  My is ordered the sausage pizza which comes with yellow onions and roasted red and yellow bell peppers (BPs).  She can't eat BPs, so she asked to substitute mushrooms for BPs.  Most places substitute veggies without an extra charge.  Here we were told that it would be an extra 50 cents.  Lame, but we went along with it. In about 15 min, the pizza came.  Mine looked fine and tasted good.  Not as great as I had had it before, but good.  My sister's was a different story...  One side of the pizza had an exceptionally large crust margin with no sauce or cheese or anything.  Also, there were mushrooms, but no onions - a pretty boring pizza.  We called the waitress over and told her the problem.  She offered to bring us some raw yellow onions to put on top of the pizza.  GROSS!  I was fully expecting that she would offer to cook us another pizza, but no luck.  I asked if she could bring out some carmelized onions (which I had noticed were offered on other pizzas) and she agreeed.  I had to come up with that idea.  Lame...  I took forever to get the onions and we had eaten 1/2 off the pizza before they arrived.  We put some on top, and it definately took the flavor from boring to interesting. The bill came and, of course, the extra 50 cents were on there.  No free drinks, no free dessert, no appolgy, no nothing...  It was a $30 tab without the tip, which I think it outrageous for two relatively small pizzas.  I can go to Stuft Pizza on The Alameda and get WAY BETTER pizza for way less money.  It was a rip off in my opinion.

I love to dine at this CPK because the staff is very friendly and the food is always consistent. Usually when I come here, I order the Avocado Eggrolls and the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza. These are my all time favorites. The eggrolls are amazing and so irresistible! The Roasted Garlic Chicken is incredible! If you love garlic, this pizza is for you.  Sometimes I like to order either the BLT or the California Club. The only difference between these two is the BLT does not have avocados on it and the Club does.

These are the things we ordered for dinner: Avocado Club Egg Rolls (Avocado, chicken, tomato, Monterey Jack and applewood smoked bacon in a crispy wonton roll. The egg rolls are served with homemade ranchito sauce and herb ranch.) - YUM!! These were so good! I usually don't like avocado eggrolls but the addition of chicken and bacon made the eggrolls so tasty! Order these and you won't be sorry! Korean BBQ Steak Tacos (There are 2 tacos per order - Korean steak, Napa cabbage, Romaine lettuce, onions, scallions and cilantro on corn tortillas. The tacos are topped with spicy chili sauce and sesame seeds.) - The tacos were good but nothing to write home about. I did like the tangy marinade/sauce they used for the meat though. Chicken Lettuce Wraps (Minced chicken, wok-seared with Shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts and scallions. The lettuce wraps are served with spicy soy-ginger sauce. You can also get shrimp instead of chicken or a combination of both.) - I ordered this as my entrée because I wasn't that hungry but it's a good amount of food. The lettuce wraps were good but nothing compared to my mom's recipe! Thai Crunch Salad (Napa & red cabbage, chicken, cucumbers, edamame, wontons, rice sticks, peanuts, cilantro, carrots and scallions tossed with lime-cilantro and Thai peanut dressing.) - The bf ordered this as his entrée and I've had it before. I'm not a huge fan of this salad. Maybe it's the dressing? Caribbean Sunset Sangria (The sangria is a blend of mango, apple, Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio, Malibu Passion Fruit Rum and DeKuyper Peachtree Schnapps.) The sangria was super sweet and just tasted like juice.  The menu items here are hit or miss. Some things are really good here while others are not up to par.

This place has put chicken in my salad more than 12 times!  Our routine is to order food to go, then when they bring the salad, we look at it, spot the chicken, and have them remake it before we leave.  You think they would get tired of this, but no, apparently not.  I've only found a stray piece of chicken in my salad at the restaurant once, and I've eaten here close to 40 times.  But to go, it seems to be 50/50 on the chicken. They don't take reservations, even for a party of 10. Vegan Report: Their vegetarian Smashed Pea and Barley soup is awesome.  I also love the Thai Linguini without chicken and the Thai Crunch Salad without chicken.  The Miso salad is also good but there is barely any avocado in it and I don't know if the dressing is vegan.  There is a good deal to choose from, so this has become one of my favorites for local take-out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=500

Paul K.,"Santa Clara, CA",110,148,1,4.0,9/2/2006,"One night in Manhattan after seeing Nacho Libre ( because it was opening night for Pirates 2 and that was sold out ), I needed something to eat because the aforementioned `film de la toilette` had me feeling sick. On our walk back to our hotel, I stopped in at `New Pizza Town` on Broadway and my life was forever changed. I can no longer handle the weekly tradition of Stuft's bulky pies. So, I've been looking for anything comparable to the simple thin crust, sauce, cheese and basil slice I had that night. Tried Vito's Famous on Reed near Lawrence, and thought that their Vito's Combo would have been more appropriately named ""Vito's Exxon Valdez"". Mio Vicino's on Benton in Santa Clara was the next place I tried and I probably didn't even need to mention that. So, last week, I brought home a Sicilian and a Margherita Pizza from CPK, and the four of us had to rock, paper, scissors for the last slice. The Margherita was more popular than the Sicilian, but they were both great. I think I've been avoiding ordering pizza from this place for years because I was turned off seeing a bbq chicken pizza on the menu ( which is as alien to me as banana lasagne ) The only downside is having to drive through that thing they call a parking lot on the Forest Avenue side of Valley Fair, but CPK makes that more bearable with curbside pickup.

I know that the economy is bad but the food is just not good enough to justify paying $40 with tip for two people to eat lunch (1 appetizer, 2 small cups of soup, splitting a small pizza). I could get past it though were it not for the cost of a well drink. My friend wanted a Vodka Gimlet and the bartender on duty was not sure how to make one. So he passed along the instructions and soon one appeared that wasn't too bad. Until we saw the bill - $13.50!! Apparently, the bartender used the best Vodka and when my friend instructed two shots he had made the drink twice as large.

We had dinner there really late, but the service was still upright. I believe we started the night off with the appetizer of spinach artichoke dips. I am a picky person, I mean chips are just chips. But their spinach dip was pretty decent. So I chose Wild Mushroom for one of the main dishes and it was the best pizza that I have tasted in a long time, especially since I don't like cheese, which means that I don't have a thing for pizza. But seriously, the Wild Mushroom was amazing with it's Portabello and white mushrooms. Yeah 5/5. My brother ordered the Buffalo Chicken, because we thought it'd taste good since it looked like it was new on the menu. But you know what? 1/5. I thought it just tasted strange with the carrots and celery or whatever it was on it. Plus the spicy flavor just made it taste sour with the other nasty stuff. But overall, I do think it's one of the best pizza places because last year when we went we ordered California Club, and it was like the classic kind of grilled chicken thing going on. Oh I think last year we ordered the Chicken Dumplings for appetizer. Yeah that thing, so not worth it. Just go to Target and get a big pack from the freezer and cook them yourselves.

The cauliflower was perfectly crispy, and beautifully presented. Very similar to the flavors in buffalo wings but vegetarian. The pizza was also great, with a crust that was just the right balance between chewy and crispy. We also got the butter cake with Haagen Daz for dessert. This was buttery and a good complement of warm and cold, but very sweet.  What impressed me the most was how great service was.

The BBQ chicken pizza is definitely their best pizza, but I remember the Thai pizza from a previous visit being unique and good as well.

Emily Y.,"Campbell, United States",378,162,465,4.0,9/4/2017,"First time trying this chain restaurant CPK at valley fair location and it was surprisingly very good. We came in at around 2pm when it was always passed lunch time, so the wait time was only 20mins, not bad at all. My girlfriend orders 4 dished - 3 seasonal items: mushroom pasta, green hot peppers, bacon pizza (I wasn't sure exactly the name of these dishes as I was looking for parking and heading to meet her up while she ordered it for us), and chicken salad. The service was quick and fast, and the food was ready within 15-20mins after ordering them, very efficient. I love every dish we got and we devoured all of them, very satisfied with the food quality and service.  The ambient was really nice inside and I saw people sitting the bar eating as well, this could totally be a fun HH event. I absolutely love their CPK foods and would definitely come back again, of course not during the peak hours lol.  All dishes came out to be approximately $50 in total and we were stuffed and ready to do some shopping and walked it off some calories.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara
Patrick A.,"San Jose, United States",169,85,139,3.0,9/9/2017,"I love CPK and I really wanted to give this location 5 stars because of the service alone. Unfortunately, the construction sort of hindered my experience.  My girlfriend and I arrived and we were sat immediately. The host was super friendly and so was our server, Taylor. We started with the artichoke dip and a couple beverages: a mai tai and and Moscow Mule. The Mules here are pretty good, but maybe not the best choice with the artichoke dip. The dip was great, though. It was cheesy and it had nice, soft chunks of artichoke. It would have gone great with an 805.  For our entrees, we ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and the Shrimp Scampi with Zucchini. The chicken was perfect. Great presentation, tasty flavors, and the bok choi and mushrooms in the sauce were a perfect selection. Unfortunately, the shrimp dish was...well...not what we expected. It might have been an over-sight by the kitchen when they plated the dish. I hope next time they're a little more vigilant. For me, it's all about service, and Taylor nearly hit a homerun. We'll call this one a ground-rule double because of ""fan"" interference. Hopefully, our tip reciprocated her good service. We spoke with the manager, who was also super friendly, and told her about our concern regarding the shrimp dish. She also took care of us with care and sympathy. In the end, our experience with CPK wasn't ruined because I know how well their food can be and how great their service is. We'll definitely give it another shot, but we'll probably wait for construction to finish. So this is a temporary 3 stars for the service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara

The egg rolls tasted just like it was advertised.  I could not wrap my head around the fact that I was eating a fried club sandwich.  The egg rolls were served along with two dipping sauces: ranch and a chipotle sauce.  The chipotle sauce tasted more flavorful than the ranch so it was my favorite sauce to dip the egg rolls.  For our main course, the Sicilian pizza was thin and crispy and topped with sausage, prosciutto, basil, and pepperoni. The menu said it was supposed to be spicy, but since it was not we ended up showing the pizza with pepper flakes.   The service is decent and the atmosphere is casual.  The food is just ok, but CPK is a quieter place to go if you want to get away from the mall crowd.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=60

Here's an embedded tip... Ask for the salad to come out first otherwise you will get your pizza and salad served together. I personally like to eat my salad first and have an internal struggle when something awesome like a pizza has to compete with a salad sitting next to it... So the Pizzas are really small (6"") but teamed with a small salad it's just about the right sized lunch for about $11. Chunky Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushrooms on top of perfectly gooey and crispy dough is a real treat, even if it's micro sized. The Spinach salad is really awesome, it's served with a sweet and tangy dressing on the side and topped with candied nuts, crisp apple slices, Quinoa, and some slivered carrots. Delicious!

Loved the pesto cream pasta. I substituted the penne with angel hair. The angel hair was a bit thicker...more like regular pasta. It tops with sundried tomatoes making it a bit more tart and sweet. Bit oily from the pesto. Added chicken for an addition of $3.  Chicken was not dry but juicy.  Ordered a lemonade and I find it to be very sweet and there is not a great taste or lemon. Although very refreshing, but very sweet.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=20

However, I've experienced sub standard service in ToGo every single time. Our recent worst experience is on the eve of superbowl LI (2017) , I ordered 4 pizza and 1 pasta. Pretty standard and simple. However, when i reached to pick up they closed the restaurant 1 hr early due to emergency (superbowl) which i was not made aware of. I had to call and ask them to open the door. When i got the order after paying, none of the pizza had dressings. Just Plain dough .i mean like if i just want to eat baked dough , can eat at home. Their reason: they are out of dressings and seasonings. I don't understand if you claim the order complete and have guts to ask for money, you should make sure pizza is complete. Chipolte pizza and tostada pizza is just dough without the dressing and nobody wants to pay 15 bucks for that. After some explanation, they get some dressing but of different pizza to keep us going. Ohh and they were out of bags due to 'emergency'.

Second lie. We saw her talking  to them and the hostess  who we complained about kept looking  over at our table and laughing.  I was unaware  this team was managed by immature idiots who lack customer service and people skills.  The manager never apologized  for our bad experience  nor did she ever come back to check on our table. Our amazing waitress LORENA had more management  skill than her own manager. She apologized profusely and asked if there was anything she could do to fix things. How is the employee more educated in making moments right than management. How.

Even when we asked for extra, there was so much oil in the dish it was useless. Second, they were out of all draft beer and mostly all bottled beers. Not a huge problem, but no warning so we spent  some time naming out beers we wanted to keep getting a ""'no we're out"" response. Third, the food was really subpar.

The California Pizza Kitchen at Westfield Valley Fair is my favorite location for one reason, the floor manager is so good.  She buzzes around like a bee.  Any time I have had even a tiny issue, sometimes when I didn't even know I had an issue, she swoops in and makes things great.  Tonight's experience was trouble-free, but she was still there making sure it was all smooth. The new parking structure adjacent to the mall is open now and next to the entry to the restaurant so parking was the easiest I have ever experienced at Valley Fair.  Nice. Jason and his wife shared a pasta dish.  I ordered the half California Cobb Salad, good as always, and tried a non-alcoholic froufrou mango cooler drink that wasn't half bad.  We shared the Chicken Dumpling appetizer (yums) and a couple thin crust pizzas we literally chose from the pictures on the front of the menus.  One pizza was Jamaican Jerk Chicken-- probably not the right name for the pizza, I did not detect any jerk flavor, but it was really gooood.  Thin crust, a sweet-spicy sauce, red onion, red bell pepper and applewood smoked bacon, what's not to like.  We also had a thin crust Spinach Artichoke pizza with chicken which was also tight.

It was super crowded on a Friday night, but luckily, we only had to wait about 15 mins.  Started off with the avocado eggrolls and then got the chopped chicken salad (whole) and the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza to share. The avocado eggrolls were good, but not even close to the quality and deliciousness of the ones at Cheesecake Factory. They've got cheese and chicken in them and a crispy  thin shell. The chopped chicken salad was fresh and tasty. At about $15 a plate, it is a little pricey, but the food here is generally a little bit expensive for the quality. I always get the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. It's got an interesting taste to it that you can't get anywhere else. Seems like it's got some sweet and sour sauce on it with pepper and maybe cinnamon? Lots of interesting flavors. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of it, but I thought it was delicious because it tasted so different from a normal pizza.  Service was great, fast and friendly.

Kristine F.,"Hayward, United States",448,568,3762,4.0,9/1/2016,"25 minute wait for two on Friday night. We shopped around for a bit and were seated after coming back. Lots of families with strollers parked around the waiting area. I've never seen this place so busy, and with lots of kids. My friend and I sat at one of those high tables in the rear meant for four so we had plenty of room. It was a lot quieter since the kids that could sit on those chairs had to be old enough not to fall. Sarah was prompt to ask for drink orders and brought them out with the bread I asked for (upon request). It comes with olive oil dipping sauce and the bread was toasty warm.  She proceeded to take our entree orders: wild mushroom pizza and half Thai crunch salad. Both were delicious and a portion of the pizza had a lot of cheese and herbs on it-- so good and fragrant with every bite! I finished my half salad and was surprised I didn't have to ask for less dressing. Last time I ate at a CPK it was almost drenched, not at this location though. Salad presentation was great! I dug in without taking any photos, sorry! The greens, edamame, cucumber slivers, and peanuts were evenly coated in sweet peanut dressing, generously topped with thin rice sticks that were drizzled beautifully with more dressing. For $11.50 it was very filling. The $15 full size would've been too much.  While service was always polite and friendly, our waitress wasn't around much aside from taking our orders and asking how we were doing. I think her other tables were far from ours. We asked a different waitress for napkins and she obliged. Payment was quick and the leftover pizza boxed up. Our water wasn't refilled so I assume they're still conserving water.  Turns out the Take Out area was on that end of the bar behind us. It's not the best location for that. Stanford shopping center has a designated take out area right behind the hostess stand, which is a lot more convenient than walking all the way to the back of the restaurant. I ordered a take out CA club pizza from this area and it was so busy no one came around for five minutes. With a 15 min quote, I told the manager(?) who rang me up we'd come back after shopping. Well, I came back half an hour later and this lovely lady named Sheena with stylish crimped platinum blonde hair and black roots tied up with a bandana headband already knew the CA club was for me (was she psychic?). She assured me twice the staff was preparing the salad topping fresh. I didn't mind the wait as my friend and I took our seats at the bar. It's rare to encounter smiling upbeat workers so near to closing, but she made my CPK experience end on a brighter note.

Jimmy L.,"San Jose, United States",33,854,133,3.0,29/8/2016,"Twas 8:30pm, and the Cheesecake Factory had an hour and a half wait, so Dad and I ventured here. They were crowded, but the wait time for a table was only about 15 min. or so.  We were seated by a server with a good smile.  In the past, I'd normally share a pizza and appetizer with someone, and get maybe like a half of a BBQ Chicken Salad, and the food has always been fairly good. Pizzas are normally California style with a hand-tossed thin crust topped with a variety of non-traditional ingredients and sauces. One of the proverbial favorites is the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which has a reall good flavor profile. Some are gluten-free, I think. I thought I'd venture out of my comfort zone and order something other than salad. As I was looking at the menu, though, maybe a 1/3 of it is (naturally) pizza, and the rest of the menu are appetizers, soups/salads, drinks, a handful of specialty entrees, and a handful of pastas.  I went with the Jambalaya Fettucini - spicy, w/blackened shrimp, crawfish, chicken, andouille sausage, and ham ($16.99). My Dad ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti, which he said was good. Wait time was a good 15 min, or so.  On mine, though the flavor profile was pretty good, and piping hot, the pasta was still raw. Now, I like al dente, but the texture on the pasta was still hard! I sent it back, and had to wait another 15 minutes. The server reassured me that they would cook the pasta a little bit longer. The next one came out even more piping hot, and though it didn't have the crunchy texture this time, the pasta was still firm, and pretty borderline al dente on the firmer side, but better than the first. There is actually a really good amount of all the ingredients. My only comment about the dish though, is that it's a bit too complex with a shitload of ingredients, and prob could do without the chicken and the ham.  Been coming here off and on over the 15 years they've been here, and have always been a fairly decent standby. They are most definitely family friendly, casual, and have a good formula going.  On the other hand though, this will never be my top go-to place. I do think that the chain kind of needs to freshen things up a bit from the bottom up - from restaurant design - to menu.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=40

She didn't even say sorry and just let us keep waiting!  Finally we were led to a table by a girl who was much better and at least apologized to us for those two rude girls in the front desk. Then came the waiter, cold, and didn't care about us at all. He served three dirty plates like being left on another table, with oil on it. We requested to change.

Weekends especially calls for a waiting time which sometimes is annoying considering the walks n shops n bags one already has gone through in the mall! The summer seasonal sip for the day- Strawberry-Mango cooler was very refreshing! Rightly sweet n chilled! Amazing to beat the stress n heat. California veggie is one pizza always n one on our table as i am a vegetarian. Flavors are good,though if spiced up a bit it'll be scrumptious! Portion size meant for two. The base was soft and not chewy though the pizza didn't have a load full of veggies it tasted well to the palate. The Tortilla spring rolls were amazing. Rightly spiced,great crunch and the mushroom stuffed to the right portion this bite just melted in the mouth. Served with salsa dip it tasted great. For dessert,again to the season we had the strawberry shortcake with icecream and whipped cream! Simply Wow!! I forgot to count in the calories I loaded on myself then!

Mona M.,"Fremont, United States",0,16,10,1.0,1/3/2015,"Cpk valley fair I have been to this location number of times but off late I see that the service has gone from bad to worst. I see reception staff lost. I asked for something, she acknowledged and then forgot about it.  Service is very slow and inconsistent. We have been served bread and olive oil in the past. And also saw it on other tables when we were seated but they did not serve us that. Anyhow we had few appetizers in mind so didn't miss it much, but pointing out inconsistency. There was no silverware provided on our table.  We placed our order of soup, appetizers and main course. She got us appetizers and some main course. So we inquired if she was getting the soup, lest she forgot about it. She replies I got what my two hands could carry :( Is that how you reply to customers in hospitality industry? All she had to say is, its coming up.  Quesadillas were burnt. Nuts had gone rancid in Pear and gorgonzola pizza, so we informed the server. She came back with a comment from chef - ""that's how hazelnut turn out once baked"". Really? Like I do not know the difference between rancid and baked taste?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=80

Sean B.,"San Francisco, United States",2247,2841,1486,2.0,7/1/2014,"I mean, it's a chain restaurant in San Jose. So I went into it with low expectations. I really did. But for whatever reason my friend really wanted to go here tonight, so we ducked in while we waited for his iPhone to be repaired. I think he's just an Apple addict who wanted to be close-by in case something went wrong, so he could burn the case in effigy or something. He's kinda that guy. So in we went. I got a salad since I didn't want to do pizza at 7:45pm. A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips, and all that. He ordered a salmon dish from the ""light"" menu. We also had a special menu item, guacamole and chips, while we waited. The guacamole was bland. No other way to say it. Also, the portion was small enough that even though there were only about 15 chips on the plate, they outlasted the guacamole. I don't think this was a kitchen issue, it looked just like the picture on the menu. I just think that it's poorly conceptualized as an appetizer. The salad was just so-so. For the same price, the Cheesecake Factory, just down the hallway, is three times better and 50% bigger. My friend's salmon was just a bit dry and overcooked, and the portion was a little on the small side.  Disappointing to say the least; although again, pretty consistent with my experience of anything that's not pizza at CPK. The hosts and servers couldn't have been any nicer, which is why it's two and not one star, and I half-think that the kitchen did the best they could with uninspiring recipes and mediocre quality ingredients. But yeah, I'll pass. And my stomach was upset later too, if the humdrum dining experience wasn't enough. Just one of those chains that continues to exist in spite of itself.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=80

Kiara C.,"Los Altos, United States",0,9,6,1.0,16/1/2017,This was not my first time here but this was one of the WORST experiences ever. I had ordered food to go and got there at 6:15pm but didn't leave until 6:45pm with my cold food. Why did this take ridiculously long??????? All because I had asked for extra sauce which mind you I had asked for extra sauce when placing my order online but after looking at both of the pasta it was clear that there was barely any sauce. After 15 minutes of waiting for 2 table spoon of sauce I told the girl that wasn't enough and needed more...so here we go again waiting for more damn sauce and after 10 minutes she comes back with more sauce and says per her manager she needs to charge me for all this extra sauce. UHHHM WHAT?!?!?!?!!? Again this was not my first time at cpk or this location of cpk but definitely my last time here.  I told her to get her manager over here. He comes over and I'm absolutely livid with this unacceptable service and he sees nothing wrong with my pasta and only thinks that the only thing they did wrong was miss my asking for extra sauce to begin with uhhm no big deal that I've been waiting around for 30 MINUTES just for this damn extra sauce that they wanted to all of sudden charge me extra for which btw I've never been charged extra for..I did not receive an apology just him saying that he would take 20% off my order..that was cold by the time I got home.

Denise L.,"Santa Clara, United States",971,2329,3799,3.0,5/4/2012,"It's been years since I've dined at CPK, and I was able to reminisce my college days eating dinner here last night. It's a smaller location, but luckily we didn't have to wait since it was a weeknight. I didn't appreciate being seated at the second table to the outside door because it was super windy, and the waiters kept going in and out of this door. Not sure why, pick ups? Also, being seated here, our waitress wasn't super attentive, or was just super busy. Had to ask for utensils, plates, and the bread (the madre was starving), which should be pretty common things to give. When she finally gave us 3 slices of bread, I had to ask her for the utensils and plates as she walked away. Ridiculous. I normally order the garlic chicken pizza, but decided to change it up with the Jamacian Jerk pizza. When I asked her how it was, she said it was pretty sweet, but good. My mom ordered the jambalaya pasta, which I had remembered being good, and my dad ordered the steak tacos (he's an odd one). Our food came out, by another staf, and I sampled the jambalaya pasta first cuz they give you a ton! Pretty good, a bit on the salty side, but really liked the noodles. They were perfect al dente and width. My pizza was wayyyyyyy too sweet, but nothing a little ranch couldn't fix. Which another waitress brought. I think our waitress was being totally overworked? Not sure, but weird that she didn't come around much. My dad enjoyed his tacos, and they give you a good amount of blue and corn tortilla chips.  My waitress saw my soda was dwindling and that she'd bring me a new one. It took a good while before she brought one.  3 stars for the so-so service and seating us in the way back when there were other tables.

I'm not a huge fan of franchise restaurants, mainly because they all seem to have such generalized food that never really impresses, but CPK is a refreshing reanimation. This location is nice and spacious, not small and crowded like the ones in Hawaii, and the servers are extremely attentive. Speaking of, Nick, my server for a couple my visits, was GREAT!!! Since I was all alone, it was great that he didn't bug me too much but just made sure I had what I needed.  The food is pretty fantastic too. I had their BBQ Chicken Salad which was super tasty. the Sage and Truffle pizza was -Ah-MaZing and it's a good thing they keep that rich tasting pizza small, the corn/tortilla soup is okay but not amazing, the Lobster-mayo pizza is only good if you're a super fan of lobster and mayonnaise, and the Salted Caramel pudding is pretty yummy!! What I'm really saying is this: everything is spot-on delicious! I always tell myself to be more adventurous when I go to an old favorite spot, but sometimes that sentiment is hard to keep when going off-book ends in disappointment. Good thing CPK hasn't disappointed me yet!! I've been to several California Pizza Kitchens but none have impressed me like this location.

They even have a great beer selection to choose from, which is always a positive in my book. Service in general was a bit slow, but we had a great waiter regardless.

Tom T.,"San Jose, United States",0,13,20,4.0,26/8/2014,I had a great pizza at California Pizza Kitchen.  I order the Sicilian for the first time and it was packed with all different kinds of meat.   The sausage was particularly tasting.   My friends all shared it because there was no way I could finish it.  I would not ordered if you are watching your figure because it was over the top fattening.   I've added a picture of the pizza so you can see how great it looks.   For a restaurant with so many sites they do a good job keeping up the quality so I would suggest trying it.   It is also convenient since if you are shopping in the mall you can get some food and then keep shopping.   For pizza it came up pretty fast too.   I thought it was going to take a lot longer that it did.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=160
Richard A.,"San Jose, United States",3,10,1,5.0,30/7/2016,We have been coming here since they opened and know the staff and management. They are great and the food is always spot on.

Where is the customer service and loyalty to customers that have been coming here for over 8 years. This is sad and may be a deal breaker.

Then we also had the garlic sauce pasta. I got the penne to substitute the fettuccine and added onions with sundries tomatoes. It was really good. The garlic cream was not too heavy.

The manager came by and introduced himself and spent a little time talking to us.  The waiter was attentive and helpful.  He brought refills without having to be flagged down, checked to see if we had everything we needed.  While the menu still has a lot of the old favorites, it now has a great new selection of farm fresh items and lunch specials that it didn't have before.  I can't wait to try them all.   The one thing we look for in a restaurant is cleanliness and how friendly and attentive the staff are.  This place gets 5* all the way around!!  Honestly since the renovations and new menu have been put in place, this place is perfect.  Absolutely no complaints at all about this location.  Well done CPK....the staff and managers at this place are the absolute best!!   I highly recommend this location to anyone wanting great food and amazing service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=160

Most of my favorite dishes have been taken out of the menu. I agree that they should change the menu once in a while, but they shouldn't take out the popular dishes.  However, our waiter was friendly and knew what to suggest. I could tell she worked there for a while since she knew the dishes that we wanted were no longer there.  Overall, I was quite disappointed with the food. it was still good, just not as good as it used to be. Especially the tiramisu. I used to love the tiramisu here, but now it just does not taste the same. In addition, I am a huge strawberry lemonade fan, but their lemonade is too sweet.

Cindy K.,"Folsom, United States",208,1066,517,2.0,2/2/2014,"I hadn't been to this CPK in over a year since the one at Oakridge is closer to home, but since I was at the mall and this is one of my go to places for lunch. It was an interesting and refreshing surprise to see they had redecorated/refurnished the whole restaurant. There's slightly more seating now. Service is still on the slow side.  I try to avoid eating here exactly around noon. I like to go around 11 or 1 to avoid the crowd and long wait for a table.  CPK keeps reinventing themselves. Which is nice. They're trying to cater to their customers' palettes. I love their new bread and olive oil. Really yummy. The spices they add to the olive oil is a nice touch. However, our food was a little disappointing this time around. I pretty much always order the same thing, which helps me gauge the quality of the food. Or you could say I'm boring. Well I always get the tortilla springs rolls, baja chicken and thai chicken. I also get the wild mushroom pizza.  - I think the avocado they used for the guac wasn't ripe enough.  - Spring rolls were burnt on the ends and ruined the overall taste for me. - No shitake mushrooms on the wild mushroom pizza?! - Pizza was super soggy in the center. I think that was the first time my spring rolls were burned like that. Huge disappointment. Perhaps they changed the ingredients on the wild mushroom pizza. It was a new taste. It was yummy. I really love mushroom, but I was sad that there wasn't any portobello or shitake mushrooms on the pizza. What really got me upset was that the center of the pizza was soggy. That's never happened to me before. Blehh. At least the crust was crispy and good.  Our waitress was nice. Even though it was busy and she didn't get check on us that often, she made up for it by giving us promptly giving us stuff when we asked for it.  Oh and what happened to their small bites?? Oh well.

The manager finally came to take our credit card after looking up from her phone and realizing we were ready to go.

The hostess refused to seat her until all in the party was present. It's a Tuesday and it wasn't busy... wouldn't explain herself when I asked her her reasoning. Brushed it off like servicing customers wasn't her job. I've worked many years in the industry and it's staff like this that really upset and make me not spend my money there anymore. Hopefully they can resolve the issue by training someone who can think for themselves and attempt to accommodate a family with three small children. Won't be back for awhile which is too bad.

Stephani M.,"Airport Mail Center, United States",607,405,1744,5.0,3/1/2015,"#2 Wow...I simply cannot believe how CPK makes such great food every time I visit.   My GF Ilana, her son and I were out shopping at Westfield Mall and we both became hungry from all the exercise we were getting strolling in stores--I do not walk about much since foot surgery, so this mall is pretty extreme.  We remembered the CPK we ate at in Pleasanton and decided to give this one a try.  There was a pretty big line for a lunchtime, but we left our name and grabbed a menu to start checking out the selection.  About this time we saw the same manager from the Pleasanton location, Tony, and he remembered us--pulled us out of line and gave us a table...wow!  I told him, ""You know, I wrote a yelp review about you at the other location.""  He said he had read it and thanked me for my kind words, and then explained that this was his primary location, not Pleasanton.  Okay, it's a bit far for me to drive, but it is nice to be treated with such grand hospitality (thanks Yelp!, I think our wait was shortened because he read the review--wink, wink).   Our server approached us, Katie, with a welcoming smile and a great attitude.  My friend's son was ""starving"" and cranky so she asked Katie if we could skip the pleasantries and hurry and get him a pepperoni pizza in the oven.  Katie did not seem irritated by the request at all, and she ran off to accommodate Ilana's son.  Okay, now I am ""wowed"" twice during this visit by CPK. Katie came back and took our drink orders since the kiddie pizza was cooking now.  I asked her to please help me out by recommending her favorite item(s) so I did not hold her up, she looked pretty busy.  She quickly described her favorites, and told me about her favorite 'new' item as well.  She hurried off and ordered our drinks so we could make some decisions.   She arrived back with our drinks and at the same time a young guy delivered the tiny pizza to our minor companion so he could solve the hunger issue he was dealing with, thank G-d, as his i-pad was out of juice, he was hungry, the adult conversation was boring him to death, etc., etc., etc... We made our decisions: Tuscan White Bean Hummus Petite Wedge Salad Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Cedar Plank Salmon Red Velvet Cake  Our hummus was superb and it was served with warm pita bread triangles.  The wedge salad was great, so we shared that after the hummus.  The shrimp was amazing.  It was served with thinly sliced zucchini over top of pasta in a delicious sauce.  I was jealous, as this was Ilana's food--but I kept eating it.  But, my Salmon was 'off the hook' as well.  Salmon served on a cedar plank, along side of a white corn succotash covered with feta...wooooooow, again!   While we were eating the service manager, Deanna, came to the table and invited Ilana's son on a tour of the kitchen to watch the cooks make pizza...wooooooow, again!  How cool for kids to be able to get a little tour and special treatment at such a busy location.   After he returned, the Red Velvet Cake came too!  I never eat sweets too much (I am sweet enough already), but this looked like something my grammy would have made, so just one bite--it was crazy good! Now, I realize CPK is not meant to be fine dining, of course; however, the treatment we received at this particular location was above standard--anywhere!  Tony runs a really tight ship.  You can tell from Katie's professional service, Deanna's awesome guest relations with tiny diners, and the remarkable teamwork we witnessed throughout the restaurant.  We will be back for sure to be ""wowed"" again.

You will not be disappointed.  My main course was the Main Lobster flat bread.  Again. Whoever made this menu and these dishes are pure genius. The flavors or every ingredient was perfectly fused together. This is an amazing dish and I highly suggest it if you get the chance.  My boyfriend got the kung pao noodles. That shit was the bees knees. So fricken good. Sweet and with a perfect hint of heat. And the shrimps were cooked perfectly. All around great dish!  We both ordered the sangria drinks. They were both really good. The mango one taste strongly of mango and the Appleberry one taste more like the traditional red wine sangria.  Oh yea. dessert.  Forget your stupid diet and get the Strawberry shortcake WITH ice cream. Just do it. Stop questioning it. You DESERVE IT.  SERVICE:  our server tonight was Christian. He was great! He is attentive, and would frequently come by our table to see if everything was okay or of we needed anything else. The manager came by to see how our meal was and that's always nice.

A- for the new chicken dish (great flavor & lovely veggies, but too salty) C+ for the kids' fusilli Alfredo  (my kids who can normally eat adult size meals, didn't even want to finish it.  They thought the sauce was too thick, and wished for some veggie sides.)  Note, my kids are Jr. food critics (amateur ones of course), so may be a bit tough.   Got some potential prize cards for next time I visit, and visit I will.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=140

The first time I was here with my friends, the waitress completely forgot to put my order in and I didn't get my order until I got my check although I reminded her several times. The last time I was here, I was ordering to go. Justin and Robert, the hostess' were completely rude to me and other customers. I just wanted to order to go and they gave me a shitty attitude when I asked them a few questions, like where to put in my order. Then, Robert hit a customer while swinging some kind of tray with his arm and didn't he didn't apologize. In fact, he laughed about it even though she was offended. After she left, Robert turned to Justin and started to talk smack about her.  Great customer service, CPK.

Not quite a five star............yet: The chef was a bit light handed with the spaghettini portion and the chicken slices were small.  Literally, my husband finished his food before I can even take a second bite from his plate...sad.  Luckily, I wasn't too hungry.  I was only half way through so I shared the rest of my salmon.

Paula P.,"San Francisco, United States",61,63,76,3.0,2/7/2015,This place is just a basic CPK. It's not really big. The atmosphere is kind of dark. The entrance is pretty weird and if there isn't a host standing right there no one will see you for awhile which is kind of what happened but not why I'm removing stars. The service was okay. The food was alright. I really liked their pizza crust. The baked potato soup was delicious. The tortilla soup was also really good. We came during lunch and it was fairly busy. We got a really monotone server who was a no bs kinda gal. She wasn't faking any interest in us and I liked that. you're going to get a good deal coming here for lunch but the killer is really the overpriced drinks. Iced tea especially unsweetened unflavored should be complimentary. Especially since it was gross and especially if no ones going to refill it. I would eat here again but it would only be if other people really wanted to go and I was giving in. I wouldn't seek it out on my own.

Hailey D.,"San Jose, United States",12,51,27,5.0,26/4/2015,"The best service I have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life - no joke Showed up with a party of 15 last minute after the Cheesecake Factory refused to take a reservation and then falsely promised us a table and gave it away not once but twice. After explaining our situation, the hostesses (Crystal and Carly) at CPK were eager to help us out with no hesitation. We were seated within 5 minutes. They brought us warm bread and olive oil dip right away. Our waiter, Joneil, was amazing. He greeted us promptly and was totally happy to be serving us which is really great because most waiters are usually not excited to serve big parties. He always made sure our glasses were full and brought our food out in a reasonable amount of time. I got the shredded mushroom and spinach flat bread (exceptional) and had a couple bites of my friends meals and everything tasted pretty good. My friend wanted something off the old menu that they no longer served but he had the guys in the kitchen make it for her anyway (amazing!!!!). We had a couple more people join us later on in the night and he had no problem taking their orders. He even treated us to dessert!! It made our night and we couldn't be more grateful. He was even cool with splitting the tab which is usually our biggest challenge when we go out. At the end of the night he was kind enough to walk us to the door. I wish this was the experience I had every time I go out!!  Bottom line is you can't go wrong at this place.

Having said that, I am writing this review based on my last 4 encounters with CPK. First order was made through Door Dash. The Chicken tequila fettuccine was under cooked. The noodles were hard and there was no bread in the bag like I specifically asked for in the comments section of my door dash order. I called CPK directly and got the manager who said that she couldn't understand why the pasta was undercooked because it's cooked once during beginning of shift and then again when it's ordered. She did offer to send me a gift card for my bad experience. Once I got the gift card in the mail I ordered the same chicken tequila pasta twice. Both times I went into the restaurant to pick it up. Both times it was great just like I remembered. And both times they included bread in the bag like I had asked. Last night I ordered from Door Dash again. Mostly because the new parking situation at CPK valley fair is terrible. There is no longer spots for picking up your ToGO food. What do you know? Pasta came undercooked AGAIN and no bread and olive oil like I specifically asked. Not to mention the Door Dasher came 45 minutes late. (Which is a separate compliant I have made with DD). My conclusion? Door Dash orders at CPK do not get the same level of customer service as TOGO orders or restaurant patrons. Had I been sitting in the restaurant I would have sent the pasta back both times! The cooks need to check the pasta!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=180
M P.,"San Jose, United States",92,109,33,2.0,13/2/2012,"The only good thing about this restaurant is the service. My waiters/bartenders/hostesses have always been on task and friendly. The food... a whole different story. I only come here because I work in the mall and it's one of the only places I can relax and read a book while I get lunch. The food court is crazy loud. I've ordered variations of the same things hoping that the next would be better; macaroni and cheese, alfredo sauce w/ fusilli noodles, cheese pizza, and pepperoni pizza. All of these are $10+, and all of them are not that good.  Charging the amount of money they do for the food they provide is crazy. I honestly could get better food in the food court for less, but CPK is a much nicer atmosphere. First of all- the pastas. Horrible, they have the worst sauce(s) I have EVER had in a restaurant. It seems like they take 2 teaspoons of water, add some watery cheese, and drizzle it over your pasta. I uploaded a picture to show how gross it is. It all pools at the bottom of your plate- IT AIN'T CHEESE. I don't know what it is but they should be embarrassed to serve it. They even had the nerve to call the sauce in the picture ""creamy"". Dream on. Definitely won't be trying the pasta again... The pizza - mediocre. Maybe less than. I don't like the sweetness of the crust, the sauce is very very bland and they don't put much on, and the cheese is also bland. Maybe if you order a pizza with yummy toppings you might not notice the lack of quality- but if you are eating it plain or with one topping it truly does not taste good. And I adore pizza!

Brendan D.,"Cupertino, United States",369,222,92,4.0,30/11/2015,"Just this past Saturday, I was at the mall with my family shopping of course since it was Black Friday weekend, and we decided that it'd be nice to give CPK a shot, since it's been there pretty much forever.  We entered around 5:30pm or so, we asked for a booth and were seated immediately.  After perusing through the menu, I decided on one of their seasonal specials, the sunny side up pizza, my dad went for the thin-crust sicilian pizza, my sister went for the thin-crust chicken pesto and artichoke pizza(not actually sure if this is the name, but that's what was on the pizza ^^), and my mom went for their salmon entree.  We also decided to try some appetizers, so we went for the white corn guacamole with chips and an order of 3 spring rolls thai-style. After taking our orders, our waitress asked if we wanted bread, and of course we did, and in like a minute she quickly returned with a a plate of bread and a plate for each of us to eat off of.  As a dip, we were served a small dish of olive oil that had an abundance of herbs and a few red pepper flakes.  I've actually never been to a restaurant that served herb olive oil with bread before, but it was extremely flavorful, and the red pepper flakes added just a nice hint of spiciness. Our appetizers arrived around 15 minutes or so after we ordered.  I was a bit saddened initially by the amount of guacamole we were served, and it's  maybe a few ounces in weight, but luckily the flavor made up for it.  The white corn was nice, fresh, and crisp, and it added a really nice sweetness to the guacamole.  The chips themselves were perfectly salted and complimented the guacamole well.  The spring rolls we ordered were wrapped in pieces of tortilla and pan-fried.  Each roll was served with it's own dish of peanut sauce, very similar to the peanut sauce you'd get with a Vietnamese spring roll, but more on the peanuty side.  They were a bit on the small side, but after biting them, again I was quite impressed with the flavor and crunch.  The wait for our actual dinners took a bit longer than expected, but our waitress continually checked in on us and apologized for the wait as well as making sure to refill our waters consistently, and offering up more bread each time she came, but after the 2nd order of bread, we had to call it quits to save room for the main meal.  Eventually our meals all came out together nice and hot.  The salmon my mom ordered was cooked on a piece of cedar wood it seems and in an oven.  It was cooked perfectly with a nice char on the outside, yet still soft and moist on the inside.  It was garnished with a sort of corn salsa that has a spicy kick to it, and it complimented the salmon very well.  My sunny side up pizza was a pizza with green onions, bacon, thinly-sliced and crisp fingerling potatoes, and two sunny-side up eggs.  Yummmm, even though it sounds like it should be brunch haha.  My actual pizza was a bit smaller in size than the pizzas my dad and sister received, and I guess the crust is their normal crust, which was cooked well and soft like bread when I bit in.  My whole family in general really enjoys a crisp crust when it comes to pizza, which is why my dad and sister went for thin-crust options.  Although the pizza looked quite crispy, when actually biting into it, they both noted that their respective pizza were sort of on the soft side, and probably because of too much oil on top.  A slight bummer, but the flavors were really good.  My dad's sicilian pizza was topped with spicy salami, sausage, pepperoni, and sliced basil.  It had really good flavor despite the lack of crunch.  My sister's pizza also had good flavor, but it was a bit on the heavy side because of all the pesto. We all didn't finish our respective meals because there was a lot of food, but we made sure to save room for dessert.  We asked our waitress for the dessert menu, and when she handed it to us, she highly recommended the salted caramel pudding with cookie bits.  I went for that, but my sister opted for the chocolate souffle cake with a scoop of ice cream.  The desserts came out fast, and we dug in.  My pudding was amazingly exquisitely.  The sweet caramel was balanced well by the salt, and then the soft texture of the pudding and whip cream on top was balanced by cripsy cookie bits at the bottom of the jar.  I really enjoyed this dessert and would recommend it to everyone!  My sister's souffle cake was decent, but we've had better before, and it's sort of a staple at a lot of restaurants, so it wasn't anything out of the extraordinary. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal here.  The price point is a bit high, but I mean it's Valley Fair, so it's understandable.  For both appetizers, I wish the portions could have been a bit bigger, but the entree and pizzas were all a good size for the price.  Good meal, and absolutely fantastic service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=100

Roberto Carlos ..,"San Francisco, United States",1,28,45,5.0,2/8/2014,"I used to wonder why a restaurant was always so busy. Was it due to the quality and selection of the food, the location, decore, lighting, ambiance, reputation, or even the chef, support staff, or management. I've come to realize, that after all is said and done, all of the above play an important role. As individuals, but especially more so, as customers, we tend to gravitate to the comfortable, to the better quality, to the individual needs and tastes we enjoy.  By that I mean, we can choose to frequent certain establishments or choose to play ""Dining Lottery"", at every occasion we eat out - especially in the Bay Area. We have no end of choices in the variety and selection of food in which we may partake. That being said, I would like to highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen, located at Westfield Mall Valley Fair. (As it can become quite busy, I recommend that you give yourself a few extra minutes to be seated. The wait time shall be justified, as I have alluded to above). We arrived just before 6 pm and were added to the waitlist. As David, at the reception area, took our names, he asked us our preference of seating location. We could be seated at booths, high tables, the bar, and even outdoors. Wow! How many restaurants have that many choices yet even offer the customer a choice as to where to sit! (Believe me, I've been in many restaurants and I have never been offered the pleasure of choice). We like David, so will you. Josh our host was a pleasant surprise and a welcome pleasure. He was very friendly, had a great smile, a great personality, a calm demeanor, and most importantly, as busy as it was at the restaurant for he and all the staff, he made us feel welcome. To me, that is going,"" Above and Beyond"". At a lot of establishments, they tend to make you feel like they are pushing cattle. Here at California Pizza Kitchen, we felt as if they had known us and were treating us as V.I.P.'s ! (On a side note, Josh offered to take our drink orders to help the wait staff.  It was crazy busy that night. I decided to play a little joke on Josh, and asked him for iced coffee. Without batting an eylash or skipping a heartbeat, Josh said that they did not carry iced coffee in the menu, but, they did have coffee, and they did have ice. He offered to bring them out with a creamer and he asked if that would be acceptable.  Holy cow!   Josh was on top of it! And as a matter of fact, we did order the iced coffee). That's what I call exceptional service. Thank you Josh. Another high point in our dining experience was our waiter, James. Once again I'd like to point out that it was quite busy. James came to our table offered to refresh our drinks drinks and gave us the menus. He pointed out that fresh bread was in the oven and he would bring it out shortly. After a while, James came back and took our orders. He noticed immediately that our ice water needed refreshing. (Without having to be asked). I call that, being ""Prescient"".  Pior experience at other establishments has proven that customers usually have to raise the waiter's attention in order to refill the water glasses. James was also very attentive, I noticed, to all his customers in his area. After delivery of our food, James made sure to stop by and ask if we needed anything else. Considering the wait for our food, James presented us with ice cream, free of charge. Quite admirable, thank you James.  As stated with Josh and David, James was  exceptional with a nice personality... Made us feel very special indeed. The food of course, at California Pizza Kitchen, is always fresh, tasty, crisp, warm, hot , cold, salty, sweet.., where and when appropriate.  They have an extensive menu, all of which are yummy. I make it a point to try something different each time I return. Sadly, I haven't been able to make it out too frequently..,but that will change. I'd also like to compliment the chef, the cooks, the other wait staff, and all the support staff necessary to keep California Pizza Kitchen running smoothly. *On a side note.* I had the pleasure of meeting Peter, the general manager. I noticed him walking around throughout the evening, checking on staff and visiting tables, speaking with customers. I caught Peter's attention and ask him to our table. I spoke to him about everything that I've written above, shook his hand and explained to him that we were highly impressed with his restaurant and his ability to pick staff and show them how to accommodate customer's needs, the California Pizza Kitchen way.  Peter was quite pleasant to talk to. Thank you Peter! I wish Peter and everyone at California Pizza Kitchen good health, prosperity, and happiness.

It came out messy looking with green peppers that looked like they were thrown on last minute (barely cooked onto the pizza). I think we were most disappointed with the service. Both dishes were just dropped at the table without asking if I needed condiments--fresh cracked pepper or parm & red pepper?? I had to wait a long time to ask for extra dressing. When the pizza came out, no one asked if I needed peppers and parmesan (I also had to wait awhile to request them). The server came by multiple times to quickly ask how everything was.. it felt so rushed and forced. I'm sad to say I won't be coming back to this CPK, I can get a better salad and pizza elsewhere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=100

My coworkers and I all love each other and enjoy each others company, so we often go out as a large group to have a girls night. We made a HUGE mistake- choosing the Cheesecake factory whom gave away our table twice. In the end, we were going to have to wait over 2 hours... no thanks.  Our large party of 17 called California Pizza Kitchen at a late hour (Thanks Cheesecake!) and we were told if we hurried we could get great seating. WOW did Cheesecake pull through! Crystal and Carly were able to seat us as soon as we arrived! We were seated in an area where a couple very large tables were put together for us. Our loud and boisterous group sat down, and we were introduced to JoNeil. JoNeil took our drink orders and didn't even mess them up. Normally, waiters are a little hesitant around our large group of girls- not JoNeil! We immediately felt at home and comfortable. We were able to talk and joke with him. When it came to food, JoNeil took all of our orders (again- no mess ups!) and even split all of our checks... something we're not used to at all with a group ranging from 10-20! Just when the night could not be any better, JoNeil surprised us with desert that he had bought for us! Was this real life? We were all treated the way people dream of in restaurants.  The food was awesome and the customer service was ABOVE and BEYOND!! Working at a job that is pure customer service makes me value when I see a real passion for people- and CPK has it. Given the amount of girls and the late hour, I am beyond impressed- and thankful- for the amazing treatment I received at CPK. Thank you CPK and thank you JoNeil for the great night!

Richard N.,"San Jose, United States",174,239,,3.0,22/12/2010,"Goats Will Love It..... The chain of California Pizza Kitchens is a sit down restaurant version of a food court...like the one here at Valley Fair.   My wife and I ""borrowed"" our 5 1/2 year old granddaughter for 3 days while her parents took a quick vacation to Las Vegas.  We promised her a visit to the Build-A-Bear store and she waited patiently for almost a year.  With her newly boxed bear, we walked around the mall and eventually decided on CPK. There's nothing especially wrong with the place.  The food is okay, servers are nice and the atmosphere is a little less hectic than the shoppers on steroids outside the door.  It's a small oasis...and I'd emphasize small rather than oasis...in one of the busiest centers in the US. The 2 young women in the greeting area were very nice and asked how they could accommodate our granddaughter and her stroller.  We left it by the door and sat in a quiet booth near the kitchen. The menu offers many choices, but you've got to wonder how a restaurant which focuses on pizza can do with salads, sandwiches and other unrelated entrees.  I guess well enough to keep the place full by 12 noon on a Wednesday. I had a ""5 cheese and tomato"" pizza which had plenty of dough for just $11.   Taste and texture seemed fine with the first slice, but as I mowed ( or chowed ) them down, the good feeling gradually flitted away.  It didn't age well.  The crust grew harder, the cheese became gooey and the tomatoes disappeared into the cheese.  By that last piece, eating was almost like a job.  I did it because I paid for the thing. My wife had the shrimp miso salad for $11.  While it didn't cause her to breathlessly exclaim ""that's the best I've ever had""...she said it was good enough to order again.  I tried some, but could only recommend it for people who just need something to chew.  Goats would love it. Our granddaughter ordered a bowl of pasta from the kids menu and gave it a thumbs up.  She was given a booklet and crayons with games and pictures which kept her ( and the new bear ) very occupied.  As my wife remarked ""it's nice to have a child friendly restaurant while shopping"". Value was respectable given the fairly large portions and reasonable prices...a nice thing to find among the upscale stores in Valley Fair.  Service was friendly and efficient. One special note.  CPK publishes a book with all sorts of interesting nutritional information on every item on the menu.  A great idea...even if you don't pay attention to your diet.  They hand it to all customers with the regular menu. If shopping makes you hungry, California Pizza Kitchen ( across from Starbucks ) offers a restaurant-like alternative to the food court on the 2nd floor. Personally, next time I'll be walking through the court. Pros:     Not bad food at reasonable prices.  Caters to kids (if you have them). Cons:    Nothing exceptional.  Provides temporary relief from crowds.  Caters to kids ( if you don't want to be near any ). Ratings: -   Overall:      3 -   Food Quality:       2 -   Food Quantity:     3 -   Service:     3 -   Menu:    3 -   Value:    3 -   Atmosphere:    3 -   Nutrition Book:   5 -   Kid Friendly:     4",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=220
Christina W.,"San Jose, United States",0,28,,3.0,12/4/2015,"Service was good, pizza was good, but the one item we usually enjoy at the restaurant has changed for the worse since our last visit three months ago. We usually get the garlic cream fettuccine.  Usually this is a white cream sauce with a nice garlic flavor.   We ordered it at our visit yesterday and the sauce was tan in color (not white) and had two or three big teaspoon-sized glops of a salty garlic paste amongst the pasta.   Waaaaaaaay too much garlic and salt.   My daughter (who typically enjoys this entrée beyond measure) only ate two bites.   None of us liked it.    I asked the waiter if the recipe had changed but he didn't know because he was new to the job.   If you look on the online menu on the CPK website, the sauce looks much like we are accustomed to receiving--with white sauce.    To the waiter's credit, he offered a different entrée but we declined since the rest of the party was finished eating.   When we received the check, we were at least happy to see that the cost of the entrée had been deducted.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=220

Stephanie C.,"Redwood City, United States",4,363,5,4.0,16/4/2013,"Normally, I think I would give this place 3 stars, because while the pizza is tasty, it's not super amazing. For this particular location, however, I'm giving an extra star because of our waitress, who was super accommodating of my friend's toddler. She was really attentive and checked with us about bringing things out all at once or as things got finished (and apparently with a toddler, as it comes is generally better). That they seat the child-toting crowd in the back is also a plus (surprisingly not something I see as often as I should in restaurants)--when not in the company of children, I much prefer to be quite separate from them. We had the spinach artichoke dip (which doesn't have egg in it, yay!) and my friend got the pork wontons for herself and her kid. I very much liked the dip, and also enjoyed the pizza I had, which was the wild mushroom pizza with a whole wheat crust. The different crust gives it a nice rustic feel that I hadn't tried before, and I think that's probably the way I'll order my pizzas from CPK in the future. That their kids' menu had a mac & cheese with edamame was really useful, too (her kid loves edamame). I would pick this over the food court any day, for sure, and even if the crowded mall isn't the best seeming location, both the food and the service are good and that's the kind of thing that will bring me back again next time I'm hungry at the mall :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=220

They tell us that they cannot bring us any of the appetizers because they ran out of chips.  what. can you bring it out with bread instead?  nope.  ...so we didn't get any appetizers. We each got a salad instead. All of us when gazing upon our salad...look at the sad bed of lettuce with around 3-4 pieces of fruit and a sprinkling of cheese. :(  I came back to give this place another chance when finding they totally revamped the menu. I had a little bit of higher hopes...but...my expectations weren't met.  I got spaghetti cuz you can't go wrong with that...but it seemed to lack seasoning and my noodles were over cooked. The fried mac n cheese looked promising but came out dry and sauceless.  My brother enjoyed his alfredo and his girlfriend thought the mushroom pizza lacked something and wasn't what it use to be. We all shared another pizza to give it another go, but we all felt the same way about the second pizza. Their bbq chicken use to be one of my favorites, but it was bland this time around.

They are branching out into bolder areas, like taking a cue from the taco truck craze and have introduced Korea BBQ steak tacos and quesadillas.  Pear and gorgonzola, roasted artichoke and spinach, and Thai chicken are some flavors that the out of the pizza box thinkers have concocted.  If you're looking for a pizza but tired of the same old pepperoni, this could be a good change for you.

Kristi L.,"New York, United States",221,203,224,3.0,23/7/2012,"One thing about this place is that they give tiny ass portions for what you order. You know, normally when you order a pizza, it's big enough so that you couldn't finish it in one meal (unless you eat a lot, unlike me), but their pizzas are like as big as a regular plate. That is definitely not worth the $13 I put in when I could have went to Domino's and ordered a large pizza for $10.  But anyways, that's not the point. I came here with several friends I haven't seen in a while in a group of 10, and the wait time wasn't too bad on a Saturday night, around 20 minutes or so. By the way, CPK doesn't take reservations, so you have to wait if it's a crowded night. The service was decent, it wasn't so bad that it started annoying me, but it definitely wasn't great.  I ordered the white chicken garlic pizza and the small craving dish ""fried mac and cheese"" to share among three people including me, and boy, was I glad that I ate some food before I came here. The ""fried mac and cheese"", which I thought would be an actual dish, was actually 4 fried balls of clumped mac and cheese. And I finished the slices of the pizza within 3 minutes and still wasn't satisfied.

I really liked it, even though it kinda tasted a little like grass, pea soup. The pieces of barley really give it a bit more texture and chew since the rest of the soup is mushy. It wasn't too salty and had good pea flavor to it. Such a good surprise. The Works Little did I know that ""The Works"" is really just a combination pizza.

We ended up picking CPK as it was faster and cheaper as we are broke college students ballin on a budget.  We ended up ordering three pizzas which were the BBQ Chicken, Thai Peanut and The Meat Lovers pizza. The BBQ chicken is usually the go-to pizza if you don't know what to pick. It's usually not a bad choice. The pizza itself is not too sweet or tangy, and the chicken is pretty tender, unlike some other places.  The Thai Peanut on the other hand was a real trip. We decided to be adventurous so we ordered it as we all agreed that Thai Food is good so lets try it. It was... well It was interesting, it definitely was not bad. The pizza itself came with a sweet peanut sauce, kind of like peanut butter but less rich and creamy. The pizza is then topped with bean sprouts, carrots, cilantro, and peanuts. I could have done without the bean sprouts. The Meat Lovers Pizza is a thin crust pizza with lots of meat. The pizza is delicious, but it may get salty as you keep eating it. I also ordered a side of truffle oil since it goes well with some of their pizza.

Although it may seem pricey for a salad, it comes with crab, edamame, and a light miso sauce with rice noodles. Delicious! I also love their fried fish tacos and would definitely come here for those fish tacos over Wahoo's anytime. If you're feeling indulgent, you can try their red velvet cake.

Donna Z.,"San Jose, United States",630,557,106,4.0,6/7/2013,"Visiting CPK on a weeknight is becoming a monthly (or more!) tradition of sorts. It's our girls-night-out (or as much as you can do on a work night), and a great excuse to shop!  My usuals are the peach salad or the pear and gorgonzola pizza; both of which are consistently delicious. We'll usually split a bottle of wine between us too (which is extremely affordable, I might add.) Their olive oil concoction that's complimentary is wonderfully fruity - I find myself looking forward to it landing in front of me on the table. The service is standard. No amazingness and no disappointment.  The only negative I can think of is: on our most recent visit, the A/C was not on (or not on high enough) and when we mentioned this to our server, she agreed but didn't attempt to solve the problem. This was a temporary downer, but nothing a glass of wine couldn't fix.  We'll be back soon!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=200

They get that not everyone eats meat. they get that people have allergies. They get that people have religious beliefs that prohibit eating animals. They get that people want to eat healthy. They get that vegans exist. my mind=blown. A simple Google search shows me that CPK has a special menu where they list every VEGAN option, every LACTO-veg option, and LACTO-OVO veg option!

SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP was delicious as always. You think you're gonna run out of chips but it's actually perfect. BBQ CHICKEN SALAD was okay, too many tortilla strips I think and not enough substance. SICILIAN PIZZA was yummy with lots of different Italian meats on it, but it was pretty oily and the whole grain crust we opted for was not good.. I was thinking whole wheat though so biting into bits of grains in my crust threw me off. Also, they give you the nutritional facts on everything, which made me not want to eat there since EVERYTHING on the menu is at least 1000 calories, even the salads.

We felt sandwiched in.  Not to mention, the food made me and my boyfriend sick. I had to miss an exam the next morning because I couldn't be far away from a toilet.

We both really loved our dishes. My Chicken Piccata was more of a tangy flavor that surprisingly blended really well with the chicken. I thought it was amazing how they made that into a cream sauce. Overall, they've got a few tasty dishes that I like! As for customer service, we had a server named Gatis who was really friendly. He checked on us and didn't get our order wrong.

Fatty foods & fruity alcoholic beverages, why not?? Not gonna lie, the best part about this place... their drinks! For those of you who'd rather taste the sweet calorie juices of a drink rather than the alcohol, they have it all here! It seems as if they added a little more to the menu, especially for beverages. I got the cooler sunrise sangria and the bestie got the passion fruit mojito. These were both hands down the best drinks we've had... And we've had A TON of drinks in our time :) Onto food: My usuals have always been the chipotle chicken pizza or BBQ chicken salad. Whenever I come with my sister, I ALWAYS have to steal a slice of her tostada pizza. Super fresh! Totally a fan of the corn guacamole sides, except the tortilla chips are a little too salty for my liking.  Minus one star for not so attentive servers.  Overall, easy accessible place to eat & catch up before or after a shopping trip.

Kailey O.,"Campbell, United States",292,640,301,5.0,7/6/2009,"CPK has been my favorite restaurant since I was about 10 years old... that's a long time, so be aware of my bias. I come to the San Jose location about 2 times a month and either sit at a table or at the bar. Depending on the time of day and which day of the week you come, wait times can vary and may exceed 45 minutes. The bread that you receive before you meal comes is horrible quality. I remember when it used to be real bread and not so processed. Other than that, the service is always great, but I have noticed an increase in the prices over the years. Thank goodness for the customer surveys on the bills that automatically let you win a free appetizer or desert with the purchase of an entree. Also, recently CPK is having this amazing promotion where you receive a coupon for something that cannot be revealed until the next time you dine there. I have gotten 10 - 20 percent off of my meals throughout these last 2 months! Combine this with a free appetizer coupon and you're set. My new obsession is the grilled vegetable salad. I love the combination of avocados, sun dried tomatoes, flavorful asparagus, eggplant, and a nice balsamic vinaigrette. I always feel healthier for some reason when i order this salad, even though I'm sure it's just the same as all the others. The pizza, as always, is amazing- no matter which one you choose.

What I really wanted was pizza from Pizza Cali, but he decided to get fancy about it and come here. He ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad which he said was not good or fulfilling. I ordered a vegetarian pizza with Japanese eggplant and damn it was like the healthiest pizza on Earth. It has marinara sauce, cheese, broccolini, red onions, mushrooms, and eggplant. The waitress even asked me if I wanted to substitute for wheat dough bread like ughhhh no why try and make it even healthier! This place doesn't even give you bread and butter as an appetizer. My friend got pasta and it looked kinda plain and it didn't even cinematic garlic bread! The waitress was like catering to a million tables, so when we asked for a coke and ranch it took five minutes and the manager had to personally deliver it to our table. So if you want something make sure you order it right away!  I wouldnt come here again and pay 12 bucks for a mediocre pizza, just go to a small pizza shop and get your pizza fix.  Oh yeah and if u ask to to go something the waitress puts the dirty utensils u put on the table back onto your plate and stacks up dirty dishes from other tables under your plate.

Last time we went, we were seated right away but it took the waiter almost 10 mins to offer us water/ beverages and another almost 40 minutes to get our food. The reason why I am upset was because there are still many open tables so I do not see where the delay is coming from.

Robert K.,"San Jose, United States",141,437,196,4.0,21/10/2009,"Probably one of the best places to eat when you're at Valley Fair.  Of course if it's pizza you want - You absolutely MUST go down Steven's Creek a few blocks to A Slice of New York (Yelp! it) for the best pizza around.  But this will do if you're mid-shopping trip and getting kind of hungry and the food court isn't appealing to you (frankly the food court at VF isn't very appealing period). CPK has unique creations with lots of selections and choices.  Their pizza is about a 6 on a scale of 10.  Very middle of the road.  If it were just plain pizza it would be pretty bland, but they mask it with all sorts of toppings and unique combinations of toppings/sauces/dressing and make it different. I personally do not care at all for their pasta - I tried 2 or 3 of them and definitely did not like them.  They have good apps and good salads (huge) but you pay for what you get.   Great bar selection and desert selection as well! The wait staff at this particular location is good.  Usual Santana Row/VF attitude - nice, but better than you. Will be back, but only on occasion.

We also shared the spicy chicken quesadilla, which is also decent. not spicy at all but it tasted great with the dipping sauce. The serving of chardonnay was the best.... I really got my money's worth for that. She poured a looooot!  Service for our food was fast....but our server wasn't that attentive, and not once asked if we needed anything.

It was my husbands bday and wanted to go CPK so we did. 1st issue - They said the wait was about 15 mins and the next thing you know it was 30 mins and just a few more minutes then it was 45. There were people who came after us that sat first. We were about ready to leave when they finally said the table was ready. 2nd - YAY! We're seated and finally ordered our drinks and food. Server was nice and got everything pretty quick. 3rd - Food came, not everything came. A few at a time which we didn't care much about. Problem was we didn't have any utensils or plates since we all decided to order food to share. We tried to get plates and utensils to no avail. It's like people just kept forgetting. 4th - Next thing you know a pizza that we ordered went to the next tabel. The lady grabbed a slice and almost put it in her mouth as she kept yapping all over the pizza. The guy comes back right before she took a bite and she placed the slice back on the plate. The guy takes it back and tells the mgr (we don't know what he said) the next thing you know he was heading back to our table and gave us the pizza. I said we weren'tgoing to accept the pizza since the lady already touched it and almost took a bite. This RUDE dingbat decides to ignore us and left tje pizza at our table. 5th - Our server finally came back and told her what happened.

But we decided that probably it was an off, so we thought we give it a try again bc we tots love CPK. We were so wrong. The service was not the only thing that was wrong, the cooks were soooo cheaping out on the food.  Okay, so the waitress seems nice at first, but she did not offer us any bread, and forgot to give us water.  To top it off, the food did not get to for 20 min after we ordered, and we were seating there with no water and bread... I was super thirsty from walking around the mall, so I ask one of the other servers to please get us some water.  The server looked around dum-found, ""oh okay..."" The food gets to us, my bf ordered the BBQ pizza and I got the vegetable salad.  Oh and we get our waters 5 min after the food, yay...  We always order the same thing, so we know how the food is supposed to look and taste. So my bf's food, the pizza was left in the oven for too long, and it was like eating a cracker... I felt so bad for him, it literally cracked when he would take a bite.  My salad appeared to have no asparagus on it.  The salad usually had visible pieces of asparagus, and I did not see any.  I asked the server, ""is there asparagus on my salad?"" She replied, ""that's weird I don't see any either."" So she leaves.  We continue to eat this with really sad faces.  The server comes back with this tiny little plate (like the ones you put soy sauce in), and says, ""here you go.""  I was speechless,  she handed me this puny little plate with a mediocre amount of MINCED, yes, MINCED asparagus.  I was like, "" W-T-F...?!""  I had MINCED asparagus on my grilled vegetable salad!  Are you fucking kidding me? That is, like, one fucking spear of asparagus, minced to make it look like you gave me asparagus in my dish!  Usually they give a nice amount of big asparagus.

I used to really enjoy coming here, despite the crowds, etc.  But, sadly, CPK has gone the way of so many chains, i.e. they are not really cooking so much as following a formula which is designed to maximize profit at the expense of providing a good meal. I ordered the ""BLT salad"" pizza (thin crust) and my daughter ordered the Greek Salad pizza.  My salad arrived with nearly no cheese, overcooked and with roughly the equivalent of 1 slice of bacon distributed in teeny-tiny bits over the pizza.  There was like a little crumb of bacon on each slice--you could barely see it.  So it was more ""LT"" than ""BLT""  and frankly, they were chintzy with the L and T too. My daughter's pizza was a bit more abundant--and yet only had about 3 olives. On a ""Greek Salad"" pizza.  ??? My daughter said ""this is not right"" and asked the waiter for some more olives.  Inspired by her courage (I hate to complain in restaurants so I was just going to eat my pizza in a sullen silence) I did the same.  The waiter (who was very nice, a lone bright spot in this calamity) brought out little bowls for us.  Mine was cold as ice but-- oh well. The pizza itself was ""meh"" at best. Crust not so much chewy as leathery and tough and not much flavor.  But wait--it gets worse. We geo the bill and discover that we were CHARGED for the extra olives and bacon.  Can you believe it?  It's not the money, it was a crummy extra $2.00 but geez, talk about nickel and diming.  We wrote a very strong note to the management, took our purses and left.  For good.  To CPK I say: C U Later.  Much, MUCH later.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=320

The ingredients are all fresh & the dough has a nice flavor to it. It's sad that it's a pizza place and just has one size for the pizza.. comparable to a common medium. The salads are not legit, just a bunch of not nutritious ice berg lettuce. I ended up getting the jamaican jerk chicken and hawaiian pizza. The jerk chicken was suuuuuper sweet.. too sweet for our liking. Hawaiia pizza was legit tho. They have a small dessert selection.

He made us all feel like we were very welcome and showed us all that he is amazing at his job. He was helping a party of 15 on a Sunday night and never made us once feel rushed or unwanted. Whenever we go out our waiter usually seems frantic and stressed so we are pretty used to that but he keep cool and collected the whole time and never made us feel like a hassle.  We are so thankful for the experience and service he provided because we were going to go to the Cheesecake Factory but they gave our table away TWICE (terrible right?) and so I called CPK right away and they told us that they could have a table for us all if we came quickly. The hostess Crystal and Carly were so awesome! They set our tables and seated us faster than the Cheesecake Factory could even process the fact that they lost a huge party of 15 people LOL!

The lettuce was hella wilted, the chicken was gross, and the egg did not seem to be real egg. I couldn't even eat it...should have sent it back :-/ The only good part was the bacon, but it's hard to mess up bacon (though I must say Denny's has achieved that). Also, it said it had gorgonzola but it really tasted like bleu cheese, which I am not a fan of. Prices = too expensive Service = bad (our waiter didn't check in on us enough and we had a list of like 10 things we needed by the time she did. Also it sucks when you can't eat your food because you are waiting for some condiment to arrive). For some reason my salad got there like 5-10 mins after everyone else's pizza did. Shouldn't salad be faster to make than pizza? Also, I found it odd that they are so cheap on the bread. They gave us a couple tinyyyy slices of bread and some oil for our table, but no balsamic vinegar. We also had to ask for the bread in the first place, then ask for more when the tiny little slices were finished. Lol. Like really now... Restaurant = it is kind of loud in there and also pretty cold, but it's fine. I also found it very difficult to find something with a calorie count less than 800, even in the salad section. I don't want to be a total freak, but if I'm trying to eat somewhat healthy, I have to get a half portion salad with fat free dressing here to make it in a reasonable calorie range.  Overall, I could've had a better salad at the McDonald's in the food court, and paid a lot less for it. Lol.

Stephanie N.,"San Francisco, United States",766,230,75,4.0,10/2/2011,"CPK in Valley Fair is always a crackin' spot. - You can tell because there's a stroller parking area in the hallway parallel to the restaurant. Even babies swing by this place to eat!  The average wait time for a table is 20-30 mins on a busy weekend. If you come during the weekday, there's hardly any wait time if any at all. The service is always good and the food always comes out hot and fresh. I usually order BBQ chicken pizza and the spinach dip with a side of pita bread. They charge me an extra dollar for the pita bread but it's totally worth it! I tried their new wedge salad my last time here and I liked it. Too bad I felt that it wasn't worth the $5 as I felt I could make this at home. They don't carry thousand island dressing, WTH!?!? What kind of restaurant doesn't offer that dressing? Anyway, that was just annoying. I'd have to say that their pastas (pending which ones you get) are average. I don't think it's their specialty so I wouldn't have high expectations. I'd stick to ordering the pizza or appetizers. My favorite drink here is the mango raspberry smoothie. It tastes so heavenly!!! Many of the girly foo-foo drinks are totally delish and the beer is good. Some of my friends like the wine here but they're not expecting a lot. Otherwise, I wouldn't come here for the bar. This sounds totally backwards to me especially since I'm a dessert fanatic but the desserts were way too sweet. I tried their apple cobbler thingy and there was wayyyyyy too much caramel on it. I felt like I needed a knife and fork to break apart the dessert to even take a bite. I'd save your money and go get dessert in the food court upstairs.

Too bad I forgot his name but he was the best waiter ever! Very nice and always checking up on us to see if we needed anything.  For appetizers we ordered some sort of avocado egg roll and garlic cheese bread.. The egg roll was delicious but the garlic cheese bread was somewhat plain. Nothing special. I also ordered a peach italian soda and that was yummy! Free refills too! I mustve had 3 refills for only $2.99! For my meal I ordered the Thai linguini. Unfortunately, it wasnt good at all. Too much Peanut flavored sauce.. And it just didn't taste right.. I barely ate any of it and ended up packing it to-go. My Bf ordered the Sicilian pizza and that was pretty good. If u like spicy, u should definitely go with this one!  My friend ordered the garlic chicken. I love garlic so this pizza was my favorite!  Overall, the dining experience was good.

My girlfriends and I were doing some shopping in Valley Fair and didn't want to eat at the food court and CPK we thought was a good chain to go that will have foods that we all want.  I feel like they attempt to be healthier with the thin crusts pizza and the many choices for salads.  I haven't been here for awhile so I was excited to see the Small Cravings menu!  Its like a kids or happy hour menu or something. I got the Asparagus and Arugula salad off of that.  So good and good size for 4.99.  I wasn't looking to eat a whole lot.  The service was quick once we sat down which is nice.  I always love seeing where the waiter/waitresses are from with their name tag.  We got Joey from Hayward.

Sean L.,"Berkeley, United States",334,199,1,3.0,22/8/2011,"*CAVEAT: Expect to wait 15-30 minutes on weekend lunches & dinners. The CPK, though its namesake suggests that its pizzas are the forte, actually has mediocre pizzas. You don't have the option to choose the size: it's just individual-sized. You get a hearty 6 to 7 slices, with the most basic cheese-only pizza costing $12. The prices of the pizzas are closely on-par with those offered by upper-scale pizza chains (Amici's comes to mind), but the quality is more close to that of Papa John's or Pizza Hut. Yes, it sounds strange, but stay away from ordering pizzas at California  -Pizza- Kitchen. Instead, opt for the good soup, salad, and pasta. Personally, I recommend the Jambalaya. Price is relatively high, but every bite of it is worth it. Not too salty or overwhelming - simply savory. The Minestrone Soup is also good.

Food is decent, the way it should be at a chain.  The small bite guacamole and chips were just that, nothing special. The asian lettuce wraps were pretty good, and the portion was big enough for our whole table to get one. Steak taco, I didn't like. The cabbage was too bitter and there were a measly 3 anorexic cubes of steak in each taco. It came with slices of avocado which I appreciated, but other than that I would skip it. The fish taco was also disappointing. It's not battered and fried, but grilled and seemed to have been grilled over old and burnt charcoal or something. The fish had a bad charcoal taste to it. I guess this is why it's called california PIZZA kitchen for a reason. Stick to the pizza. The second time I had the margherita pizza which was a lot better than the other items I've tried.

Waited 20 min for a ""table"", which was one of those mini booths for 2 people.  I hate those - they should be outlawed!  There is never enough space for 2 plates and drinks and bread.  It was crowded and very noisy in there. Took our drink order right away - nice.  We ordered our pizzas.  I got the Thai Chicken, which is one of their specialties and my favorite - no problem.  My is ordered the sausage pizza which comes with yellow onions and roasted red and yellow bell peppers (BPs).  She can't eat BPs, so she asked to substitute mushrooms for BPs.  Most places substitute veggies without an extra charge.  Here we were told that it would be an extra 50 cents.  Lame, but we went along with it. In about 15 min, the pizza came.  Mine looked fine and tasted good.  Not as great as I had had it before, but good.  My sister's was a different story...  One side of the pizza had an exceptionally large crust margin with no sauce or cheese or anything.  Also, there were mushrooms, but no onions - a pretty boring pizza.  We called the waitress over and told her the problem.  She offered to bring us some raw yellow onions to put on top of the pizza.  GROSS!  I was fully expecting that she would offer to cook us another pizza, but no luck.  I asked if she could bring out some carmelized onions (which I had noticed were offered on other pizzas) and she agreeed.  I had to come up with that idea.  Lame...  I took forever to get the onions and we had eaten 1/2 off the pizza before they arrived.  We put some on top, and it definately took the flavor from boring to interesting. The bill came and, of course, the extra 50 cents were on there.  No free drinks, no free dessert, no appolgy, no nothing...  It was a $30 tab without the tip, which I think it outrageous for two relatively small pizzas.  I can go to Stuft Pizza on The Alameda and get WAY BETTER pizza for way less money.  It was a rip off in my opinion.

The manager came to talk to us and told us she was going to clear the patio for us to sit but this required us to wait around 20 extra minutes. Our entire party wasn't even hear yet but it was still 20 minutes waiting nonetheless.  We got seated and our waiter came. We got menus and our waters quickly. She came back and took our orders and we requested for bread. We actually got our food BEFORE the bread cause she kept forgetting. Food was good. I prefer the thin crust pizzas over the regular one. I got the artichoke and spinach with chicken. mmmm!!! Afterwards, we ordered a dessert for the birthday girl and specifically requested a candle be on there. The waiter brings out the tiramisu and goes ""I have a tiramisu"" and we were thinking..WHERE is the candle!!! Ruined the surprise for the birthday girl and although it was funny, it was stupid of them to forget.  When we paid, the waiter accidentally overcharged one of the credit cards. Although it was only by 20 cents, it's like HELLO WHAT are you doing?!?!?!? It was pretty ridiculous.  Overall, I will come back for the food. The service is mehhhhhhhhh but the food makes up for it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=400

Usually when I come here, I order the Avocado Eggrolls and the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza. These are my all time favorites. The eggrolls are amazing and so irresistible! The Roasted Garlic Chicken is incredible! If you love garlic, this pizza is for you.  Sometimes I like to order either the BLT or the California Club. The only difference between these two is the BLT does not have avocados on it and the Club does.

We were seated right away because we went on a Monday night. There's usually a wait on weekends though. These are the things we ordered for dinner: Avocado Club Egg Rolls (Avocado, chicken, tomato, Monterey Jack and applewood smoked bacon in a crispy wonton roll. The egg rolls are served with homemade ranchito sauce and herb ranch.) - YUM!! These were so good! I usually don't like avocado eggrolls but the addition of chicken and bacon made the eggrolls so tasty! Order these and you won't be sorry! Korean BBQ Steak Tacos (There are 2 tacos per order - Korean steak, Napa cabbage, Romaine lettuce, onions, scallions and cilantro on corn tortillas. The tacos are topped with spicy chili sauce and sesame seeds.) - The tacos were good but nothing to write home about. I did like the tangy marinade/sauce they used for the meat though. Chicken Lettuce Wraps (Minced chicken, wok-seared with Shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts and scallions. The lettuce wraps are served with spicy soy-ginger sauce. You can also get shrimp instead of chicken or a combination of both.) - I ordered this as my entrée because I wasn't that hungry but it's a good amount of food. The lettuce wraps were good but nothing compared to my mom's recipe! Thai Crunch Salad (Napa & red cabbage, chicken, cucumbers, edamame, wontons, rice sticks, peanuts, cilantro, carrots and scallions tossed with lime-cilantro and Thai peanut dressing.) - The bf ordered this as his entrée and I've had it before. I'm not a huge fan of this salad. Maybe it's the dressing? Caribbean Sunset Sangria (The sangria is a blend of mango, apple, Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio, Malibu Passion Fruit Rum and DeKuyper Peachtree Schnapps.) The sangria was super sweet and just tasted like juice.  The menu items here are hit or miss. Some things are really good here while others are not up to par. I've also had the infamous BBQ Chicken Pizza and also didn't really like it...I've definitely had better elsewhere. Our server, Danielle, was excellent. She was fast, friendly, and efficient.

However, every time I've plopped my hiney down in one of the booths, I have been confronted with a menu fraught with bizarre pizzas, crying babies, and a wait staff that should be sporting a bunch of pieces of flair (gratuitous Office Space reference). A look through the pizza offerings shows a restaurant willing to serve the unorthodox... - Chipotle Chicken Pizza - Mango Tandoori Chicken Pizza - California Club Pizza (avocados...on pizza????) - Carne Asada Pizza - Jamaican Jerk Pizza - Tostada Pizza To all of these ""pizzas"" I say ---- BLECH!!!! This is not to say that I lack a sense of adventure, or I am a pizza purist, but one must draw the line somewhere, and the buck stops right here.

My boyfriend and I have visited this location several times on a weekday and a weekend. Food is always great but the one thing that makes me irritated about this place is the service. I find the service inconsistent and not helpful most of the time. On busy weekends, I understand there are a lot of customers to get to. I understand this because I was a server myself but I know how to manage my tables. Usually servers have 4 tables max. On a weekend, I had to handle 8 tables and I easily handled them with ease. But this location had a hard time. This past Friday we were seated and were waiting quite a long time to order our food. After receiving our food our server came up to us to let us know that she was taking a break. She introduced us to another server who would be taking care of us. He only visited us once and asked us how everything was. There were dirty plates on our table and yet he just left it there. We waited and waited to get a To-Go box for our pizza and he constantly stared at us but never came up to us and ask us. Finally, he did. Overall, the environment was great.

Andrew M.,"Las Vegas, United States",15,44,1,1.0,17/5/2008,"I am not sure if they were having an off night or what....In general CPK's have been fairly decent. However this one (and especially tonight) wasn't the greatest. I went there with a group. For starters, the waiter didn't come around until 10 minutes after the entire party had been siting at the table. And when he came around, it wasn't as though he acknowledged that we'd been waiting for him. We ordered everything at once given the unfortunate omen we had already experienced. When the food came, one dish had remenants of another dish (who knows what it was, but it wasn't what was ordered.) Unfortunately our waiter didn't make it a habit to come around and check on us so I had to get up and literally walk to the kitchen and show someone. They promptly apologized. Shortly there after, a new dish came out. Unfortunately, it too again had remenants of another dish. CPK is EXTREMELY lucky it wasn't peanuts or something like that they accidently left behind because nowadays that could be fatal for kids!!! I call this type of service and quality extremely sloppy and poor. So, not only was the dish effectively ruined, but everyone else at the table had their food.

I would say I've had both a negative and positive experience here. Some days good, some days bad.  Service: Service is ok, but could definitely be better. Management is pretty good at making up for the loss of service from their kitchen staff and servers though. I came here one day with my sister and our server was non-existent because she had a party of over 20+ people sitting outdoors. Big party = big gratuity. So obviously, she was more focus on that. It seriously took her/the kitchen staff 30+ minutes to finally give us our order, and by that time we were already ready to leave. I guess our server must have overheard me complain to my sister privately that it doesn't take more than 15 minutes, even when it's busy, to serve someone's food after they have ordered because the manager approached us to apologize and gave our meal for free. Overall, I know that they're busy, but it seems like they serve some customers better than others because there were also times when people that arrived later than us would always receive their food first even though our orders were simpler.  Food: I usually get the same foods: Club Sandwich, BBQ Pizza, Margherita Pizza, Spinach Dip, and the Lettuce Wraps. Everything on this list is pretty delicious, but the deliciousness of the Margherita pizza varies. Same with their mixed drinks, sometimes their mojitos are good and sometimes they are just too watered down. It seems like they are better with wine.

My husband and I usually share a Sicilian Pizza, thin crust with Italian meat.  One item is not enough, so we need to get something else, like a pasta dish or another pizza to share.  We tried most of the appetizers and they are much better at Cheesecake factory, so we usually do not order any here.  The salads were ok but the ingredients were bite size, like in the chopped salad, but I guess that would be expected.  We like the Greek pizza, but we ask for more tzatziki sauce and avocado instead of chicken. We've found the chicken can be dried out being cooked on top of the pizza and they are cut small.  The BLT is good if you like bacon and mayo.  The pesto cream penne is good too.  We kind of all share it like a side dish. There wasn't enough raviolis to share, so that was not a good choice for us.  My sister likes the kung pao chicken.  I like the mango ice tea.  You need to ask for bread and butter.  They do not bring it unless you ask.  Kids sundaes for the kids is 99 cents.  It's vanilla ice cream with some fudge sauce, whip cream, and mini m&ms.  The butter cake ala mode is really good.  It's warm in the middle with crunchy sugary edges.  Once it was really cold and they brought us another one. Service is usually nice.  We've tried the CPK in Hillsdale, Anaheim, Fresno, and Oahu.  They are pretty consistent. We try to go before the lunch/dinner crowd, like 11:45 or 5:30 and there usually isn't a wait or later, like 2 or 7 pm.  Prices vary in the tourist locations.  Vegas does not have a kids menu.  Do not confuse the express with the Restaurant.  At the express, you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  Servings seem to be smaller there and drinks are self-serve, but basically the same taste.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=460

I would recommend it for finger food fun Though their name pizza on it, I personally go here for the pastas.  The chicken tequila fettuccine is baller. I still can't describe how good it was today, maybe it was my one meal a day thing where it heighten my tastebuds but this dish tasted like a creamy pad thai lime flavor pasta. It had a good fusion of italian mexican and a hint of some asian taste to it. Wonderful One of the few places that have a bottle of cholula ready for you, I go here for my spicy pasta fetishes. Yes, I put BBQ/Sriracha in my spaghetti, don't hate! The only downside to it is I would understand that most of the food has a high amount of butter/cream and salt to it, so if you're sensitive to that kind of taste perhaps you might want to dumb it down a bit with some wine. good restaurant!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=380

Well, here's my two cents on CPK in general: I am not a fan of their pizza. I don't know why people rave about it being one of their most favorite pizza places. Now I am not a food snob, nor am I picky with what foods I eat but this pizza was just okay which is why I am giving them a two star rating. Yes, I have definitely had better. I don't know, perhaps its suppose to be healthier pizza? I've had Papa Murphy's, I've had Round Table, I've had Costco and Sam's Club, Pizza My Heart, THAT is real pizza in my opinion. Am I wrong? Maybe? I don't want to sound fat and unhealthy but their pizza, its not pizza IMO. By the way, the times I have come here I have ordered the Italian, Tomato and Basil, and Roasted Garlic Chicken and Pesto Cream Penne (Their pasta serving was not too generous IMO). So to end, I give CPK a 2 out of 5 stars. Maybe I am not adventurous enough? Then again I've seen different pizza creations else where which taste much better in my opinion.

Also got the Waldorf salad which was again drenched in the dressing and was sub par as well. I guess the candied walnuts/fruit made the salad more tasty, but overall the food was not very well made in my opinion. Even the fresh strawberry lemonade tasted syrupy. Don't know why they were so busy on a Wednesday too. Will not be coming back!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=440

It was a decent portion and came out HOT. Boyfriend enjoyed his garlic chicken pizza which I didn't try cause I find them to be too rich. We both had the chocolate banana cake for dessert. We both agreed the banana sauce on the side tasted too artificial (like melted banana laffy taffy he said), but the banana cream inside the cake was perfect.

I have been here several times before. This time was horrendously different. Once we had ordered our food, that was basically the last time we saw our waitress again. The manager brung us our food. My boyfriend asked him for Parmesan and he never came back with it. Our so called waitress happened to be passing by our table after a good ten minutes, so we ask her for some Parmesan. She brings us a practically empty shaker with little balls of Parmesan cheese in it. It didn't even come out. We could not even ask for another bottle because she never came back.  This whole time my glass is also empty she doesn't even bother to come by to ask me if I want a refill or not. Not to even check how we are doing or if we need anything. At this point both my boyfriend and I were so furious we wanted to pay the bill and leave.  She comes back after about a good 25 min's, and we just plain and blatantly told her we wanted to speak to her manager. The manager comes to our table after 5 Min's. Just stands there, he doesn't say anything at all. Does not say he is a manager or even ask us whats wrong. We had to start the whole conversation. He seemed very ignorant himself. We even told him we asked you for the Parmesan cheese and you never came back with it. He didn't say anything. He just shook his head, like yeah ok.  He didn't charge us for anything and apologized. I was so mad. I was actually furious. This waitress made us feel invisible. As if we were not there. She paid us no mind and never acknowledged us.

What was TERRIBLE was the music.  Too loud, too heavy in the base.  Thumpity thumpity thum.  That, together with the hum of ambient chat (and the braying ladies one foot away from us) made the whole experience really oppressive.  My daughter literally sat there with her hands over her ears.  I could not hear what the server was asking, and she misheard my order twice when I was ordering.  At the end of the meal, I felt moved to write ""Please turn your music down!"" on the credit card slip.

Decided to come here with the bf and my brother while shopping around at Valley Fair Mall, not wanting to deal with the traffic of leaving the parking lots. First of, the wait was crazy long! Probably due to the fact that there were many people waiting to be seated and the mall was extremely packed today because of the whole fashion show with the celebrity stylist from Project Runaway. Either way, the host told us the wait would be about 20 minutes...I could've sworn it took at least 50 minutes which is why I bumped off a star. When we were finally seated, centuries later, we started off by ordering the spinach and artichoke dip with chips which is an ultimate classic for appetizers. No matter where you go to order it, it tastes almost exactly the same wherever you go. Whether it be BJ's, Chili's, AppleBees, etc. The appetizer truly was scrumptious and creamy. We ordered three different types of pizza: the bbq chicken pizza, the garlic chicken pizza, and the margarita pizza.  All in all, I'd say all three of the pizzas were equally good, but since I'm a chicken and garlic lover, my favorite out of the three was the garlic chicken pizza. I really like how CPK's pizzas' crusts are all fairly thin and not too greasy as your average Pizza Hut or RoundTable. Not a bad place to come to for pizza, but then again not my absolute favorite.

Cora W.,"Santa Clara, United States",0,6,,5.0,7/1/2013,"I know --- giving a chain 5 stars is strange, but we've had some extraordinary experience with my daughter's birthday party yesterday. Honestly, I didn't even know they offer kid's birthday party until I saw the tiny little flyer hanging outside their restroom. In short, the party started an hour before the restaurant opens, which was nice because we literally had the entire restaurants to ourselves. The kids were given a tour in the kitchen and its industrial walk-in fridge. Then the kids got to make their own pizza. By this time, the restaurant opened for lunch, so parents ordered food while the kids ate their own creations. After cake time, each kid was given a pencil and a coupon for a free kid's meal. The birthday kid gets a monogrammed chef coat.  A shout-out to the staff there, especially the manager Daniel and our server, Marla. Originally our party was set up at the patio. Since it was still early and the torch didn't warm up the place fast enough, Daniel asked his staff to move the party indoor. Some of the kids showed up late. Daniel was nice enough to offer a tour to the already excited kids and another one when more kids showed up. We had one guest who showed up 45 minutes late. I was about to tell her to order a kids meal since the rest were already eating until Marla offered her a personal tour and helped her with a personal pizza. I've got to admit some of the kids were not in their best behavior and literally trashed the space, and we were just so grateful for the staff's patience. At the end, we were even offered two pizzas to take home (I'm guessing they were from the extra two dough they had for the guests who didn't show up).  $10/kid is not bad at all, given the free kid's meal coupon is worth $6.

Katie C.,"Los Angeles, United States",163,407,338,4.0,11/2/2010,"Yelpers that read my reviews know that I love pizza. If it's New York Style, regular style or CPK style I have my opinions and I have my favorites. SO I a may be the odd one out of the bunch, but my favorite pizza is and always will be CPK. Well, let's just say I haven't tried Chicago style yet. But, CPK is pretty much up there. I love everything about CPK and there is no pizza that I have tried that has beaten CPK in my ranking scale.  The usual CPK that I go to is the Valley Fair one, which is crowed on weekends, rarely during lunch and week days are okay. The Oakridge one is nicer, but further from me. I went to the San Luis Obispo one which is HUGE. All the food is consistent and fantastic. Now that i live in New York, I have VERY VERY VERY happy that there are a couple in Manhattan. I love it.  Anyways on to the food reviews. Starting with appetizers. You have to ask for bread (which is free) if you want some. The bread is cold and chewy and not good. I do not recommend you ask for it. It's just filler. DON'T DO IT... If you want something to start off the meal, try the Singapore shrimp rolls, YUM or the spinach artichoke dip.  The pizzas are just plain delicious. On very rare occasions do I finish the whole pizza, only when I have starved myself the whole day. You can sub the crust for whole wheat dough. Healthier and even more delicious in my opinion. I almost tried all the pizzas on the menu. My favorite is the Jamaican Jerk chicken. Tangy, spicy and yummy. SO GOOD. The originals that most people order is the garlic shrimp or chicken and the BBQ chicken. Those are the most popular and they are very good as well. I tried the Thai pizza it was odd. Bean sprouts and peanut flavored sauces. It didn't  seen right on the pizza. If you're looking for a lighter choice, the mushroom pizza is my favorite when I'm looking for something healthy. If you want a thin crusted pizza, you should get the pesto chicken. My second favorite! So YUMMY IN MY TUMMY! I recommend any type of pizza, you won't be disappointed with any of them.  Moving on to the pasta. The mushroom ravioli is FANTASTIC (notice I love mushrooms?) The garlic cream fettuccine with mushrooms and chicken is the BEST I ever had (ironic because this restaurant is mainly for pizza). There hasn't been another place with better fettuccine. The pesto cream penne is GREAT with the sundried tomatoes. SO GOOD. I have also tried the Asparagus & Spinach Spaghettini with shrimp. It was very light and healthy. I liked it a lot. Other pasta dishes I had were the Thai Linguini and Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. Both were just okay, I wouldn't order them again.  Moving on to desserts... My favorite is the red velvet cake. It was so moist and delicious. It's the best you will get in San Jose. You MUST tr it. The Apple Crisp is very good as well. The Sundaes are just like any other. And their cheesecake is just okay. Lastly, the drinks here. I ALWAYS, ALWAYS order the raspberry iced tea and drink about 4 cups through the meal. Free refills and it's my favorite. You can't get that kind of raspberry iced tea anywhere else. It isn't just from a soda machine... NO it is MADE. So good. Okay, well now I'm hungry after going through a three course meal, BUT I highly recommend this place to EVERYONE! Great for groups, families, kids and just friends. This is my favorite restaurant and it's decent priced! Love it...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=540

Albert C.,"Newark, United States",11,14,,5.0,1/6/2007,"CPK, one of the best pizza restaurants out there.  I don't understand why people knock it because it's a chain restaurant. Their appetizers are wonderful!  Go ahead and try their Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings.  They're delicious! They have a great selection of pizzas to please any appetite.  My favorites are the original Thai Chicken pizza, and their Chipotle Chicken Pizza.    My wife loves their salads too, which are surprisingly good, and also very fresh, (the avocados in her salad weren't brown, and it was tossed for her already!).   If you're not in the mood for pizza, try some of their pastas, those are also very good.  The pasta compliment to their Thai Chicken Pizza, the Thai Linguini, is VERY tasty!  That's my favorite dish there! Their kids menu is also very good, they'll compliment whatever your kids desire to eat.  Although it says Fusilli (curly pasta) with meat sauce or cheese or whatever, you can substitute the fusilli for any kind of pasta (spaghetti, angel hair, linguini).  That's wonderful for kids (especially my daughter who doesn't' like curly things.....). Their table service is always on top of things.  The second I finish my Raspberry Lemonade, the server is already bringing me a new glass, filled with some more yummy goodness!  It's like their waiting in the shadows for me to finish my drink!   This place is great for groups, but expect to wait a bit longer until they can get the tables ready for you.   The ambiance of this restaurant inside the mall is great.  I've never had a problem here, and the food has always come out in a timely manner.   This place is where my family goes for lunch, every time we're in Valley Fair.  It's great!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=540

In fact, one time, when we ate there instead of getting curbside to-go (my M.O. about 70% of the time), we were brought our apps and our main course at the same time. As we wanted to savor our appetizers before dinner, the waitress realized that the kitchen had made an error, and brought us a free dessert after our meal (which was amazing!). The manager also came and apologized and was very sincere in his desire to set things right. It wasn't even that big of a deal, but we appreciated that they didn't act like it wasn't. They made it seem like it was below their standards and wanted to do better. We liked that. Also, we've eaten here at this location at least 15 times and they have never messed up our orders once. That's a pretty good track record considering I always have exceptions to my salad order like a different dressing and no tomatoes!

It has a mildly spicy sweet sauce, chicken, bacon, onions, bell peppers. The sauce really gets me. I heart it too much! The only thing i can think is wrong with the pizza is the dough can seem a little undercooked but i get past that love my pizza just fine.  Other things I've tried are starters such as the lettuce wraps and the pita slices with hummus dip. Theyre both delicious.  I love their array of lemonades and italian sodas. Can't find it at other restaurants. My friend tried the kiwi lemonade and liked it. I personally am all about peach flavored drinks. The velvet cake is a must for dessert. I've had better velvet cake before but their velvet cake is not bad at all. I get it everytime i go. The pricing is not bad at all pretty standard dining prices that wont hurt your wallet too bad.

I would always hear about my gf going there on her lunch break and telling me how bad it was.....Not sure why we ended up here on her lunch break this time, but we did.  Service - hostesses were friendly and Gabriel was a great server and on top of the water refills, which is a big deal to me The Works Pizza - ehhh. nothing special, but not bad. It was actually better when I reheated it later on that night Spinach Artichoke Dip - oily but good....I liked it because there was a lot of cheese and I couldn't taste ANY artichoke at all. It did cost $10, but is only worth 1/2 of that max Baja Chicken Tortilla Rolls - I liked 'em, she didn't. They were a little burnt on the ends, and were served w/ some bland guacamole. Taste reminded me of a low budget version of cheesecake factory's sw eggrolls Side Salad - not bad, but definitely NOT GOOD Side of Ranch Dressing - A for portion, F for taste. this has to be one of the worst ranch dressings I've tasted in my life....was it non fat??

Pearl V.,"San Jose, United States",1247,993,3794,3.0,31/3/2009,"I'm surprised I haven't been to this restaurant more often, especially since I worked at this mall for 4 years of my life. It's a nice place to stop and rest your footsies after a long day of shopping. I've tried: - Cherry Limeade (5/5 stars)... I'm normally not a cherry limeade person, but my server convinced me to try it. It was good and made fresh to order. It has more of a soda taste to it than lemonade, which might be the reason why I liked it as much as I did (but who knows). - BBQ Chicken Pizza (3/5 stars)... This is supposedly one of their best sellers. I thought it was OK  - Avocado Club Egg Rolls (5/5 stars)... a MUST-GET if you choose to get an appetizer. SO good especially with that ranchito sauce. - Spinach Artichoke Dip (5/5 stars)... who DOESN'T like this?! Another good appetizer to share.  - Garlic Cream Fettuccine w/ chicken (2.5/5 stars)... while this was edible, it was something I felt that I could have made much better myself at home. It was lacking something in flavor. It was a VERY small portion too! - Thai Linguine (1.5/5 stars)... Take this with a grain of salt. I only sampled a bit from my friend's plate. I'm not a fan of peanut butter in my food (unless it's dessert) so I may be a bit prejudiced. My friend enjoys it so much that she normally orders it whenever she dines here.  I'm craving those damn avocado club egg rolls again that I'm planning a return visit. SOON. I think next time I'll try one of their salads, the online menu makes them look pretty good. I'd skip the bread unless you're SUPER starving. (It's just sliced sourdough served alongside butter and oil and balsamic vinegar.) TIP: Avoid the dinner rush and get here before 6pm. We were there at 5:30pm and it was empty and right around 6 it got really packed. Oh and ask for my friend Sam to be your server, if possible. She'll take good care of you.

L L.,"San Jose, United States",0,5,,5.0,17/3/2011,"Here is some information for further yelp customers at California Pizza Kitchen Valley Fair. I used to be a server at this location and I feel that I have some useful tidbits that may make your next visit more enjoyable.  #1) WE DO NOT OFFER BREAD. BREAD IS SERVED ON REQUEST ONLY! For some reason, people get all bent out of shape about this. Several years ago CPK implemented a policy that we will no longer automatically bring bread to customers. People complain about waste - well that was exactly what we were doing when we brought bread out to people who didn't want it. If you see another table getting bread, it is because they asked their server in a polite manner, with a ""please"" and a ""thank - you"" (in a perfect world) if they could have bread when they placed their order. No, they are not a horrible server for not bringing you FREE bread. Also, we do not automatically bring water out either. #2) BREAD IS SERVED ROOM TEMPERATURE It is not supposed to be served hot. And there should only be enough pieces of bread for however many people are in your party - plus one extra. Let's do the math - 2 people in your party = 3 pieces of bread. So to recap, servers are not denying you bread by bringing a few pieces at a time. And while we're on the subject - seriously, don't come to a restaurant and split a small salad between four people but ask for 6 plates of bread. Think about this. #3) PORTION SIZES AT A CORPORATE RESTAURANT ARE MEASURED VERY PRECISELY! I notice several people complaining about not getting enough ""whatever"" on their salad, pizza, or pasta. Unfortunately, this is out of a server's control. And many times out of the control of the person making your food as well. I think you really have to be a server to understand this, but we really can't go to the back of the salad station and throw some extra asparagus on our salad because the portion size looks small. CPK is very corporate, which trust me, I was not a fan of. But because of that , their goal is to make the food the same EVERY TIME. As far as portion goes, would you believe that they actually count the number of chicken on your pizza? They do.  Sure, the kitchen makes mistakes and can leave out an ingredient. If this happens, please let your server know BEFORE you log on to Yelp and complain about it. Also, if you're not happy with the portion, please tell your server. Don't just sulk at your table like a five-year-old. They will be happy to help you out. BUT, and this is a big one, they are NOT going to bring you a huge bowl size of MORE tomatoes and then another huge bowl size of MORE candied walnuts without charging. Let's be rational here! 4) BE PATIENT WITH YOUR SERVER, AND THEY WILL BE PATIENT WITH YOU I will admit, being a server is not easy, especially at this location. People spend their day shopping and then realize they're starving. Then they're told they have to wait 30 minutes for their table. By the time they are seated, their server simply can't get to them fast enough. I don't know about you, but if I'm starving to the point that I've turned into the worst version of myself, I decide to opt out of the restaurant with the 30 minute wait.   Makes sense right? Especially when there is a food court upstairs!   I guess that's the joys of working for a mall.  Server's here work really hard. They have other customers. You are not the only one, believe it or not. BE PATIENT. BE KIND. 5) STANDARD TIP is 18% - 20% Why do people at this CPK think that an 8% tip is efficient? Servers at this location have to put up with ALOT of horrible tips that in my mind, verge on the line of being disrespectful. One of the reasons I'm not there anymore. Think about when you work your job? How would you feel if your boss came in and said ""Today, we are decreasing your pay by $10 an hour. You'll still do the same work though."" This is basically what is being done when you leave your server a bad tip, because in a restaurant scenario, YOU ARE THE BOSS. If you're server has an attitude, which is my pet peeve, then by all means reduce their tip. But also look at how you've treated the server throughout the meal. Have you treated them like you would want your son, daughter, mother, or father treated if they were a server? Sometimes the attitude is a defense mechanism, because they feel they are being looked down upon and treated unfairly. Remember, servers will give you the best customer service we can, but to stare at us like we're idiots if we forget to bring something (out of all the requests we are getting at one time) is slightly unreasonable. My advice - what you put into your experience is what you will get out of it!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=520

Iris X.,"Fremont, United States",2,31,18,3.0,22/8/2010,"Went here for lunch one day, and it's been a pretty long time since I've been back to this place. Decided to try out one of their new 'small plates' - and they ARE small plates! I love fried artichoke hearts, but theirs is 1/4th the size and the same price as the Cheesecake Factory ones! They split like three artichoke hearts into fourths and deep fry them, just to save on cost, so it was really skimpy and not satisfying at all. The remoulade was really flavorful though, so that was a plus. We ordered the Chipotle Chicken, and the California Club pizzas. Honestly, the Chipotle chicken is really good, because it does taste like Chipotle (the burrito place) on a pizza, and California Club has a huge slice of avocado on EACH piece of the pizza, with plenty of bacon and chicken. Ask to hold off on the mayo for the salad on top though, it is unnecessary and adds extra calories. Crust was thin, although it's a bit sweet for those who are used to New York-style pizzas. It blends well with the ""untraditional"" pizza flavors though. However, it was expensive, since each of the better-flavored pizzas cost around $12.79, so I would only come here if you're in the mood for pizzas that taste like something else, but it's a fair place. However, the service is another story.. Our waitress was the Asian one in the ponytail, and while in the beginning she was nice, she later on neglected to refill our water, and quickly shoved the check onto our table, without even asking if we were done eating yet. I found that to be quite rude - part of common service etiquette is that you ask a) how they are first b) come back in 5 minutes once they totally clean off their plates and have chatted for a good few minutes.

Recently though this has started to change. I know that the economy is bad but the food is just not good enough to justify paying $40 with tip for two people to eat lunch (1 appetizer, 2 small cups of soup, splitting a small pizza). I could get past it though were it not for the cost of a well drink. My friend wanted a Vodka Gimlet and the bartender on duty was not sure how to make one. So he passed along the instructions and soon one appeared that wasn't too bad. Until we saw the bill - $13.50!! Apparently, the bartender used the best Vodka and when my friend instructed two shots he had made the drink twice as large.

Jane W.,"San Jose, United States",1,18,38,4.0,6/4/2009,"Soo, about three weeks ago, my brother took his gal and I to CPK to celebrate her late birthday. We had dinner there really late, but the service was still upright. I believe we started the night off with the appetizer of spinach artichoke dips. I am a picky person, I mean chips are just chips. But their spinach dip was pretty decent. So I chose Wild Mushroom for one of the main dishes and it was the best pizza that I have tasted in a long time, especially since I don't like cheese, which means that I don't have a thing for pizza. But seriously, the Wild Mushroom was amazing with it's Portabello and white mushrooms. Yeah 5/5. My brother ordered the Buffalo Chicken, because we thought it'd taste good since it looked like it was new on the menu. But you know what? 1/5. I thought it just tasted strange with the carrots and celery or whatever it was on it. Plus the spicy flavor just made it taste sour with the other nasty stuff. But overall, I do think it's one of the best pizza places because last year when we went we ordered California Club, and it was like the classic kind of grilled chicken thing going on. Oh I think last year we ordered the Chicken Dumplings for appetizer. Yeah that thing, so not worth it. Just go to Target and get a big pack from the freezer and cook them yourselves. Oh the pastas were amazing also. I only remember the Sun-dried tomato one from 3 weeks ago though.

Then I had to wait while the server ran in to process my credit card.  I ask you, what is the point of curbside pickup when it would have been far more convenient to park in the garage, which is just as close, and walk inside?  Go ahead, call me lazy, but sometimes after a long day at work you just don't feel like trekking into the mall in heels to get your dinner.  Other restaurants offering this service have it down to an art.  CPK makes it an ordeal.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=600

This place has put chicken in my salad more than 12 times!  Our routine is to order food to go, then when they bring the salad, we look at it, spot the chicken, and have them remake it before we leave.  You think they would get tired of this, but no, apparently not.  I've only found a stray piece of chicken in my salad at the restaurant once, and I've eaten here close to 40 times.  But to go, it seems to be 50/50 on the chicken. They don't take reservations, even for a party of 10. Vegan Report: Their vegetarian Smashed Pea and Barley soup is awesome.  I also love the Thai Linguini without chicken and the Thai Crunch Salad without chicken.  The Miso salad is also good but there is barely any avocado in it and I don't know if the dressing is vegan.  There is a good deal to choose from, so this has become one of my favorites for local take-out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=500

Paul K.,"Santa Clara, United States",110,148,1,4.0,2/9/2006,"One night in Manhattan after seeing Nacho Libre ( because it was opening night for Pirates 2 and that was sold out ), I needed something to eat because the aforementioned `film de la toilette` had me feeling sick. On our walk back to our hotel, I stopped in at `New Pizza Town` on Broadway and my life was forever changed. I can no longer handle the weekly tradition of Stuft's bulky pies. So, I've been looking for anything comparable to the simple thin crust, sauce, cheese and basil slice I had that night. Tried Vito's Famous on Reed near Lawrence, and thought that their Vito's Combo would have been more appropriately named ""Vito's Exxon Valdez"". Mio Vicino's on Benton in Santa Clara was the next place I tried and I probably didn't even need to mention that. So, last week, I brought home a Sicilian and a Margherita Pizza from CPK, and the four of us had to rock, paper, scissors for the last slice. The Margherita was more popular than the Sicilian, but they were both great. I think I've been avoiding ordering pizza from this place for years because I was turned off seeing a bbq chicken pizza on the menu ( which is as alien to me as banana lasagne ) The only downside is having to drive through that thing they call a parking lot on the Forest Avenue side of Valley Fair, but CPK makes that more bearable with curbside pickup.

Decent sized portions, and interesting selctions. Personally, I like the Waldorf Salad, mostly because I like grapes and candied walnuts. The alcohol selection is interesting as well, I had a Caramel Apple martini, if you're not for sweet drinks avoid this one because it's really sweet. Gets really loud easily, and sometimes the wait staff ignores you. Prices are high, for some of the more common items, and really high for their own creations.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580
Rochelle F.,"San Jose, United States",48,163,9,5.0,13/3/2007,"I've always enjoyed the food at CPK. Now that they are starting to open up in malls and shopping centers, it's even better! It's usually busy here, but service and wait time usually moves pretty fast. I've never had a problem with their service or their food. I love their pizzas (especially the crust) and the appetizers are great! I love the avacado roll and the baja ones (there are others too).. The oriental saland is really tasty as well.. and the protobello ravioloi pasta is good too.. Never a disappointment.. It's a great convenient meal to have after a shopping trip.. =D Oh yeah, and you get freeee bread!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580
Rob P.,"Santa Clara, United States",7,64,,4.0,19/12/2008,"My favorite place at the mall to have dinner. I stick to the basics, chicken Waldorf salad and the humass appetizer. The servers are always top notch and make sure to refill your drinks without having to ask. They greet you when you arrive and make a point of saying thank you when you leave...a nice touch for a mall restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580
Mimi L.,"San Francisco, United States",52,33,14,1.0,30/6/2007,"After shopping in Valleyfair, we decided to try this place but we had our puppy along so before we made reservations we asked a waitress if it was okay to have our puppy in her bag while we eat and she said it was perfectly okay. We had barely finished ordering our meal- their manager that always wears a blue dress shirt quickly comes and asked us to leave because dogs weren't allowed. What the? This is why I gave this place one star because of their bad service. It was incredibly rude.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580
Peggy K.,"Santa Rosa, United States",0,67,,5.0,22/5/2011,"We always thoroughly enjoy our meals at CPK.  Our only complaint is that on our last visit, they'd discontinued the delicious foccacia appetizer bread that we so loved.  Now they only serve it on sandwiches.  I miss it!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580
Johnny J.,"San Jose, United States",144,304,1,4.0,19/5/2007,"CPK is always a good stand by when nothing else sounds tempting. Although after recently trying and really liking the bistro at Nordstroms, I will still go to CPK for their pizzas, appetizers and desserts. Service is always friendly and if you go at the right time there might not be a wait. Although there might be better pizzas my four stars are for the whole package.

Geomar R.,"Santa Clara, United States",127,220,11,5.0,15/7/2007,"This place is excellent.  After a long day of shopping with my fiancee, we usually end up eating here for dinner.  The food is great and the service is top notch.  For appetizers, I suggest the lettuce wraps with chicken.  If there's is more than two people in your party, be sure to order two.  Trust me on this one.  The waldorf salad is really refreshing and a great alternative to the pizzas and pastas.  For pizza, I recommend the BBQ Chicken or the White Garlic Chicken.  Both are equally delicious.  I always leave satisfied.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580

Rae L.,"Stockton, United States",8,94,13,3.0,7/7/2008,"We tried the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for the fist time and will definitely be back for more.  Their California Club pizza is always my favorite.  But their Jambalaya tasted a little like canned chili over andouille sausage, shrimp, and pasta!?!?  Weird.  The food was ""A-OK"" but the drama going on in the booth behind me between a staff member who was working and maybe another that was off shift (with the ""he said, she said, wth, wtf, wait a minute crap) was more interesting than the Jambalaya, but became a bit much since it started when we got there and seemed to still be going on as we left .  Oh, the Days of our ""early-20s"" Lives.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580

Chelon R.,"San Jose, United States",0,14,,5.0,17/3/2009,"CPK is one of my fav places to eat at.  I was just here the other day with my mom and my daughters.  At the Valley Fair location they typically ask that you leave the stroller outside the restaurant, but being that it was my little ones nap time, they were very accommodating and found us a table that would fit her stroller.  I love their salads, especially the Waldorf chicken salad (no celery with blue cheese dressing) and the Original BBQ chopped salad.  I've also had the lettuce wraps (which is a little on the spicy side, but it doesn't say it on the menu) and the sesame dumplings - all good.  My mom had the chicken chowder, which she says was good (the cup was empty, so I guess it was).  Top it off with Peach iced tea... CPK at Oakridge mall has just a great of service.  Since we live in the South bay, we often order to go/curb side here and never have to leave the car.  My husband did this trip many times during our first few weeks home with a new baby and it was so convenient.

Noah L.,"Los Angeles, United States",9,50,3,1.0,4/1/2008,"Oh come on, you're prolly wondering wtfx on that 1 star dood?  Well ""dood"" I'll tell you what's up. Me and a couple of chums are famished and are in Valley Fair shopping and we thought, hey since none of us have been to CPK, let's give it a try. The wait was 25 minutes, which is fine by me, and we were led to our booth in the corner by the swinging doors. That's chill too. We're handed our menus and we order Ice Tea (nice.). Next we peruse over the menu, order 2 pizzas and ask the waiter how big it is. He directs us to the walls and tells us that they're as big as those boxes ( we should have walked out then). We get our food and notice, wait, is this Pizza? I could have sworn we had just been served miniscule sized pizzas fit for a toddler. Without bitching, we ate and stared at each other after finishing in less than 5 minutes, staring at each other going.. ""??? Let's go to McDonalds."" I mean seriously man, if the pizzas were going to be that expensive I would have ordered an XL at Round tables for the same frickin' price. And some people were hella mugging me or something. Was not comfortable especially with the two ladies next to us fondling each other; I resorted to staring at my friend across from me disgusted at the awkwardness the two had conveyed. Two words for CPK: EPIC FAILURE!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580
Lien T.,"San Jose, United States",226,169,20,4.0,6/5/2009,"CPK is one of my favorite places to eat when i want to have a quick sit-in lunch with a friend. I am absolutely in love with this restaurant. It's ideal for a casual business dinner, a night out with the girlfriends, the family, and my cousin and i can never get enough of it. Everytime we decide to meet up for lunch, we both think CPK!! This place is especially great if you have impatient little kids running around. They offer activities to keep their little hands occupied. Anyways,  The food is great and they always have something new for you to try. The service is prompt and the people are friendly and welcoming. It is always crowded around dinner time and especially so on the weekends. So if you don't want to wait in line, call in ahead of time and you can pick up your order or they'll take it to you curbside.  I honestly  love everything on their menu. i think i have tried almost everything they have to offer!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580

It was light, but filling.  It had onions, garlic, shrimp, mmmmm! We both only finished half of it and were satisfied!  I ordered one of their strawberry lava drinks and it was sooooo good!  We also got a discount on our pizza because we had a mall employee pizza pass thingy so we got 20% off. Yay!  I'm only giving this place 3 stars though because we didn't get our bread and nothing was out of the ordinary awesome.  Good pizza though!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580
Gina Q.,"Whittier, United States",17,705,136,4.0,9/7/2007,"CPK is practically an institution in California. I went here for lunch yesterday, visiting from out of town, and decided to eat here for a small sitdown meal. The wait time wasn't too bad. It was a hopping place yesterday but not loud like other CPKs. I ordered a half salad to eat. I was pleasantly filled, along with the bread they give you, but knew that I would probably be hungry a little later on. I'd never had one of their salads before and thought I'd try it. I think next time I'll just stick to the pizza. Forget about eating healthy at CPK, it's a pizza place and I should have known better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=580
