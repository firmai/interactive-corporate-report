61,Matt C.,"Littleton, CO",24,66,58.0,4.0,2015-11-17,Dropped in to check out the mall renovations and decided to eat here. Been to several cheese cake factories and this one doesn't disappoint. We had the kids at a table in the bar area. Tons of staff on hand. There was no wait and ended up ordering the avocado egg rolls for an app. Came out quickly and then the kids pizza was ready. We had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and finished with the Carmel salt cheese cake. We'll surely be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2?start=60,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024

106,Megan H.,"Littleton, CO",112,15,6.0,2.0,2015-12-06,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factory's over the years. While I'm typically not a big fan of chain restaurants, CCF is usually pretty good. We did have a large party of 8, so I figured it would be a long wait for a table. In addition, I also assumed there would be some hiccups in the service considering they had only been open a week. When we finally got seated after an hour and 15-minute wait, it took FOREVER for anyone to even come to our table. Like, probably almost 15 minutes...just to get our drink order! I ordered a glass of the Matua Sauvignon Blanc which was $2 cheaper per glass than the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. I love Kim Crawford, but sorry - I'm not spending $10.50 a glass when I can get a bottle for $13 at Costco. I also asked her the difference between the regular chicken salad sandwich and the Skinnylicious chicken salad sandwich, as there was $1 difference in price and nothing looked different in the 2 descriptions. She said the only difference was that it came with salad instead of fries. I asked her to clarify because the regular one, you also have the option of getting salad instead of fries. She said that was it. Fast forward 55 minutes (yes 55 minutes because that's how long it took to get our food once we'd ordered), and here were the issues. I went with the Skinnylicious version of my sandwich because I always get salad with it anyway, and it was barely even HALF the size of their regular portion. I was basically starving at that point, so I wasn't super thrilled to get half the amount of food for only $1 less. Also there was maybe a tiny drizzle of dressing on the tiny salad. They brought the wrong thing completely for one person in our party, but she didn't want to wait any longer so she just ate it. The manager did come over and apologize for the food taking so long but it was all of 3 minutes before it actually did come out. I asked our server when she came back to the table if the sandwich was smaller than the regular portion (because hello, I'd specifically asked her what the difference was between the 2 and this wasn't mentioned), and she said, ""Yes it's smaller, but it is the Cheesecake Factory so all of our portions are big here."" ?!? Okayyyyyyy, thanks for the lecture, and you should have told me that to begin with because I would have spent the extra $1 and gotten the amount of food I was expecting. At the end of our 2+-hour dining experience, we receive the check. And she had charged me for the Kim Crawford wine rather than the Matua that I'd ordered. When she tried to argue with me, 3 people at my table confirmed they'd heard me order the Matua. Mind you, it was family I was with, so if I'd ordered the wrong thing and didn't realize it, they definitely would have told me. She huffed off to adjust the bill and was rude to everyone the last few minutes we were there. I'd be happy to give them another chance, but I think I'll wait a while until the staff (including management) offers a little better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2?start=100,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005

The wait was over 90 minutes which for the Saturday night before Christmas- at the mall- well Ok, I can see that being a reason.  It would be great if they took dinner reservations, because their bar area is very small and there wasn't really a place to hang out while you wait, even if you did want a drink. I did see the patio area-but being winter time, well--I'll just have to try it again in the summer to see if that helps take some of the crowded area issues out the picture.

The beets were roasted perfectly and I would say this is the best salad I have ever had. There are two reasons this experience didn't get 5 stars: the calimari was marginal at best. I have never....ever...been served calimari with cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. That's just wrong in soooooo many ways. Its a major rooky move and it wasn't good. Beau did bring me marinara sauce, but that was marginal also. There was no flavor to it. The other ding was the fact that they had only one soup to choose from. Not everyone likes mushroom soup.

52,Candace M.,"Spokane, WA",277,671,1140.0,3.0,2015-12-25,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, the portions are huge, the menu is large, and the lines are long. In these ways, this location is pretty standard. I'm boring and when I go to the Cheesecake Factory, I almost always get the same thing: a grilled artichoke and a beet salad. The grilled artichoke was delectable, as always. The beet salad didn't have a ton of beets in it, but wasn't bad. Our waiter was very nice and friendly.  I will say that this location is a lot smaller than I expected. The bar is relatively small, so it's not somewhere you can rely on if they're busy and want a relatively quick meal. We were seated in a booth and were practically on top of a family of 4 next to us. We got to hear all of their conversation. Not ideal, especially for somewhere with atmosphere goals like the Cheesecake Factory. I got a mojito and it was very good, but $12.50. We took cheesecake home and it was also quite good. My only complaints have to do with the service. This is clearly still a new location, and there are some kinks to work out. When we got up to the host stand, what appeared to be a group of teenage girls stood around talking to one another, ignoring us until they were at a good place in their conversation. Really? Your one job is to greet and seat. Maybe focus on doing that. Also, we were ready to go and were just waiting on our cheesecake, which took way longer than any other part of our meal had. I would imagine this would be pretty easy so I'm not sure what the delay was. Otherwise, not a bad visit. It's pricey, so we may not be back with much frequency, but it's nice to have it in the area.

Very nice decor, as all Cheesecake Factories have.  The lighting is a bit on the dark side, in my opinion, but not bad.  Staff are friendly and attentive.  Service is fairly fast.  This was my third attempt at dining here, as my previous 2 attempts failed due to the long waits on weekend nights (1+ hour).   We started with an appetizer - the Tex Mex Eggrolls. They were outstanding.  I got the barbecue ranch chicken salad and it was huge - definitely you could split this with 1-2 other people.  It was also delicious.  Topped the meal off with a slice of red velvet cheesecake, but couldn't eat the whole thing due to the bread and appetizers earlier.

This year we split the Chicken Madeira, which was absolutely to die for! We also always get the Tex Mex Eggrolls as an appetizer...that dipping sauce is like crack cocaine...pretty sure I could drink a gallon of it on my own. Anyway, of course you can never fail with the cheesecake. My personal favorites are the key lime, and the original with cherry preserves. For being so new, I felt that the staff was very well trained. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and fast. As with every Cheesecake Factory location, the wait is usually long, we arrived around 5:45 on a Thursday, and luckily beat the rush. Others were waiting for up to an hour.

The wait was over an hour, so we decided to order food to go. They said it'd be about 25 minutes, which was fine. The girl who took our order was friendly and courteous. Great! So we waited. After about 35 minutes, I went to check on the food. Apparently the people taking orders don't speak to one another because the lady at the register didn't have any record of our order because 'the other girl must have helped you'. Seriously? So they found the girl who took our order and after looking for a few minutes, she found our food stuffed on a shelf behind the register. Again, Seriously?! So we took our food, home and big surprise, it was cold. Not like room temp cold, almost like it had been refrigerated cold... We were hungry so I nuked my and my husband's entrees. We ate the food. Mine was still not warm after 2 minutes in the microwave, so I gave up. The only thing good about our order was the cheesecake. To put the cherry on top of a bad experience, I got a nice dose of food poisoning from my dinner, so for 12 hours, I was in agony, with vomiting, dry heaves and terrible, sharp stomach cramps? Once I recovered, I did call to let the manager know and he told me that the dish I had, the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, was a very popular dish and he hadn't had any other reports of food poisoning. It kinda felt like he was telling me it wasn't their fault. But after not eating all day, having that reheated/cold meal and then 4 hours later being stuck with my head in the toilet, it kinda seems like that food probably was the culprit.

104,Randy S.,"Littleton, CO",0,5,,1.0,2016-02-20,"I am a person who HATES to give bad reviews, But in this case I feel I have to. So far this place has been a total disappointment. We have gone twice. The first time was just before Christmas and they had not been open long. We got there at 5:30 and they said there was a wait of 2 hours. There is extremely little seating to wait. They are in a mall so you would think they would have a way to page you anywhere in the mall. Everyone has cell phone and a simple text should suffice. But they only have the standard blinking pager. This you can't get as far as the main mall hallway. So you have to stand for two hours or just guess. We guessed and made it back 30 minutes early only to be told it would be another hour and a half. That is a 3 hour total wait! My wife is diabetic and we timed to make sure she wouldn't have any issues. We ended up waiting 3 and a half hours and the food cane out cold. The apologies profusely and compped us desert (great idea for a diabetic). But I decided to give them a second chance. They were new and it was the holidays. Mid January we tried again. Once we decided not to wait again for a 2 hour wait (once bitten, twice). Next time we went back at 4:00 on Saturday we didn't have long of a wait. However, we had to wait 45 minutes between the time we ordered and for ANY food to arrive. Then everything came at once. Bread, salad, and main coarse. And my wife's Shepard Pie was again cold. Also, the had a very young woman with very long hair who was part of the seating staff hanging around the wait staff station, doing her best flirting not 10 feet from where we were eating. Amd part of her flirting was constantly flipping her hair around. This time when we complained to the manger, she just say ""Sorry about that and nothing else.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,1.7000000000000002,3.0400000000000005

Instead, we were told to get there early and there would be no problem. This was a birthday lunch for my wife. We arrived at 11:15 for the 11:30 opening. Our group was third in line, behind two couples. The doors were opened promptly at 11:30 and we walked to the receptionist station. We were told that they couldn't help us there, to go to the other station. The other station was 6 feet away behind the same counter.  We were told to go stand by the cheesecake display case and wait. Other groups were being seated, including 2 different groups of 7. One of us went to the counter and asked when we would be seated and were told that we would be seated as soon as possible.  Finally, at 11:45 we were taken to a corner booth. We ordered and then began the wait. Bread came...another batch of bread came...our drinks were refilled. No food. I was getting ready to go ask about our meals when a meal was delivered. Great, I thought, here comes our food. This was at 12:30. We had been there for an hour and one of us had a meal. No other meal showed up. After five minutes (12:35) my meal came. So 2 of us had meals, but politely waited for the others. At 12:40 two salads came out. Then the rest of the meals showed up. So we started eating about 12:45...an hour after we were seated and one and a quarter hours after we walked into an empty restaurant. We finished eating and were presented with the bill. We were never asked if we wanted dessert, just given the bill and we left the restaurant at 1:30.

66,Sean Z.,"Littleton, CO",15,75,,2.0,2016-05-09,"I'm not  big fan of the Cheesecake factory although we tend to find ourselves there periodically... The food is surprisingly good considering they offer everything from pizza to Mexican food and steaks & seafood which is why I gave more than one star. Always leery of these 8 page menus as there has to be some dishes that just don't sell as fast and likely aren't as fresh as the should be. I don't think they have a dish that could really knock your socks off, but they do well with what they have. Its not cheap; 13-$15 for a burger/sandwich is a bit nuts. Its the service that always irks me... As if they try to pass off poor, slow service as if it were really some sort of leisurely meal. To be sure a ""leisurely meal"" would include the drinks being refilled, attentive service with the waiter coming back to check to be sure your food was ""OK"" before you have had an hour so to consider it... Even worse when the waiter stops by in a half ass attempt to deliver service. Grabs one of 5 empty drink glasses and rushes off before anyone can ask for anything else. Then to take the cake he gets annoyed when he sets the refilled drink down and is immediately asked to refill the others before he can run off. Seriously this guy was either afraid of dining tables, allergic to table linens or he was running some sort of relay and was only required to touch the table and not do anything with it. Our waiter clearly did not want to be there. That or he was absolutely clueless when it comes to the 101 of waiting tables.  It got worse... dessert is at least part of the reason why many people go to the CHEESECAKE factory. Seems like if I worked at a CHEESECAKE factory offering people dessert would be a basic required function of my job. This was not part of the waiters plan though, he was ready to have us wrapped up, paid and out the door. Getting to order dessert was like pulling teeth. I know it was Mothers Day, I'm sure he had a long day and was tired of people and their Mothers making him work. These are not my problems, I am paying for it. Tipped $10 on $150 bill, which is about as close as I get to stiffing a server. I'm sure he expected more, and I had no problem looking him in the eye after I saw him pick it up and check the receipt. I have almost been fired a few times when I was waiting tables for questioning customers who left a crappy tip on what I know was good service. I am always prepared for the question when I leave a less than generous tip. Was kind of hoping he would ask me if there was a problem so I could explain the virtues of good service.

They don't want to push more than one table together. My husband, four kids and I went on a long hike and our treat was to go to Cheesecake Factory (having lots of kids, going to such a place is a rare occurrence for lots of reasons) and sit on the patio. It was a BEAUTIFUL night. It was so sad to hear, ""I'm sorry. You can't sit outside unless you want to separate."" I have to admit, I get REALLY tired of being penalized for having a lot of kids. When did that start? Is this a new thing in our country? You have to squeeze your entire family into a booth because people don't want to push any tables together? And is that not a fire hazard INSIDE? My husband and I went out to take a look and we found this: Two tables in rows, each sitting four. In-between the two tables were fake shrubs that took up the ENTIRE space between the two tables. I wish I could add a photo because we took one. It was unbelievable. Why are rather large shrubs that are stuffed in that space (with zero wiggle room) NOT a fire hazard? If there is a fire, will fake shrubs not be in the way? Will the firefighter OUTSIDE be OK with that? Or will they have to actually move them? Is it better or worse to have shrubs between two tables than having them pushed together? Will the screaming people leaving the building due to a fire trip over the shrubs? I don't understand. But, I know that our family won't be going back to that Cheesecake Factory . . . . ever.

With that come a myriad of free dishes she receives. She happens to love it, which is odd because we have very close palettes. We love the same foods/flavor combinations. However, the main dishes here are just SO bland.  Thinking back, I've also always been really let down by the food here. It's fine, but nothing special. Especially when you're dropping over $150 on a special occasion. That much money makes you want to keep your head down and just eat it to justify the marginal main courses.  Having to put salt on food in such an ""upscale place"" is weird and embarrassing. At both locations, I've been very unimpressed. They pastas need way more garlic, the sauce is so vague tasting. The chicken is usually dry and flavorless, and everything else is almost a tease of the potential. Most of the cheesecake is good. Stick to the light fluffy ones. The dark chocolate rich type is a stroke waiting to happen.  My only theory is that this is an American themed place, so the average American person will complain if it has too much flavor.

Gigantic entrees.  Husband ordered the BBQ Ranch salad, lunch size (still enough to feed the Duggar family).  I got the Chicken Bellagio.  Our son got the grilled cheese kid meal with fruit. When the food did arrive, they brought out my son's and my husband's, but not mine (weird) and didn't say anything to me about ""we'll be right back with yours.""  They just disappeared which was, again, weird.  It felt like a very long time before they came back with mine though it may've only been 2 or 3 minutes.  Still, weird.  The food was fantastic pretty much right across the board.  There was some gristle in my chicken and I wasn't 100% sure it was cooked all the way through but I'm still alive 5 hours later so it must have been ok.  The pesto sauce on the pasta, though, was soooooooo delicious.  It's almost impossible to find good pesto on the menu anymore anywhere. My husband couldn't finish his lunch-sized salad but loved it.  He brought home the little bit he had left. I'm dinging them pretty hard for being inattentive.  I had to flag down the waitress for a water refill and she never once came by to check drink fullness on her own.  My husband's soda was never refilled in spite of the three bucks they charged for it.  It seems like a lot of other people have made the same kinds of concerns known here on yelp, and so it is pretty inexcusable at this point that it's still happening.  Particularly when the restaurant is so sparsely populated.

About twenty minutes after our orders show up.  First thing I notice is my meal is literally half the size it was last time and sitting in a puddle of olive oil.  Both meals have been under the heat lamp for quite some time obviously.  I don't even have the heart to complain at this point.  My girl's burger is way undercooked.  I'm a vegan and I can see it from here.  Her salad is spring mix and the side of dressing is legit bigger than the salad.  Shoot me.  It then took fifteen minutes to get a piece of cheesecake to go that I know is frozen.  Maybe if the meathead server would have spent less time trying to hit on my lady then it would have had decent service.  At this point I'm not sure I even care about anything more than just getting the hell out of this restaurant.  I don't think we will be back ever.  Screw that.  This place feels amateur as hell.   P.S. Now neither of us feel very good.  Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
1,Bruce L.,"Denver, CO",53,1,,1.0,2017-09-19,"Went there tonight to pick up a Togo order from doordash. Arrived a little early and let the Togo counter cashiers know that I am there to pick up an order, and they informed they would let me know when the order was ready. No problem at all. I sat down patiently as I watched 4 other customers eventually get helped and was the last person there waiting for my order. The original two cashiers were still there as well as a third cashier who showed up later who did not know of my situation.  After patiently waiting about 20 minutes past pick up time, about 30 minutes total wait, I finally go up to the counter myself to let them know that I am waiting for my order. The new cashier looks at me and with an clear attitude to start off with and says ""Well IIII didn't know anyone was here for doordash"" with very apparent attitude in his voice, so I say to him ""Well I informed the two previous cashiers that I was here, and they told me that they would let me know. But yes, I'm STILL waiting for my doordash order."" I would not have responded that way if there hadnt been that look of disdain on his face and voice to start off with. After my response he then proceeds to aggresively put his hands on the counter as if trying to intimidate me and leans towards me and told me not to give him attitude. Clearly he had a problem with me from the start before I had even decided to give him my initial lippy  response. Granted I look like a 20 something years old, when in reality I am 30 years old, so I feel this guy got on his macho guy attitude on because he thought some kid was trying to make him look foolish.  I'm sorry but I am not some child that he can reprimand or tell me how to react to his intimidation so I just said, ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" In response to his intimidation tactics. If you are going to put your hands in a defiant manner on the counter and treat me as if I'm a child, of course I will defend myself. He then proceeds to ask me ""You gonna cuss at me?! What are you going to do about it? He was clearly trying to get a reaction out of me and yes it worked. So I told the cashier ""I'm a grown man and can cuss if i choose and fuck you"" and walked out the store. I then proceeded to call the manager of the store to explain what happened, and she keeps on saying I'm sorry if something happened to make me have a bad day? Uh yea you're cashier is ptententious ass. But by then I was so frustrated and was seeing red from being mistreated that most of my conversation with her was nothing but curse words. Been delivering from DD for two years. NEVER had an encounter like this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
14,Linda H.,"Littleton, CO",36,1,1.0,4.0,2017-09-20,I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory. I am never disappointed.  This time I tried The Chicken Medira. The menu stated it was the most popular dish. I wondered how I had never tried it before.  The mushroom Medira sauce was heaven. I was hooked at the first bite.  The service was great. The portions huge so there is plenty of leftovers for tomorrow. I would definitely recommend giving it a try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

It's next to the Big 8 (Sports shop?) and there is to go parking as Always. I came in, literally the guy at the counter annoyed me, or maybe I get annoyed too quickly.

The eggs had cheese shreds that weren't even melted and my ""crispy"" bacon showed up almost raw. We had appointments for the day and didn't have time to wait another 30 minutes for fresh hot food to arrive. Didn't even take a bite. Three $3 on table for 1 cup of coffee and were asked to ""wait"" another 5 minutes for the manager to have the audacity to walk over and try to tell us he ""had our bill"" for inedible food we didn't eat a bite of.

I always went the cheese factory at park meadow mall; but they opened a new one at southwest plaza. Therefore, I planned my birthday dinner over there; but it was so so so upset me. First, the food was made wrong. Second, service was awful. Third, after I talked to the manager and he had done nothing. Forth, after I talked to manager, everyone acted differently. The waitress had to leave because her ride was here and she didn't want to spend money for Uber. The bus boy tried to make us leave by clean everything on the table ( especially the water that I still drinking). The new waiter told me:"" just tell me what you want to pay!"" After I mentioned that today is my birthday. Do I get a cheese cake for free? I usually a easy personal and not complain. Because I have 2 friends work at cheese factory that they told me the host suppose ask if we have any special events going before they sit us; but the host didn't ask me anything.
