8,Maggie K.,"Metro Manila, Philippines",50,312,606,4.0,2015-04-29,"I don't think you can get a better deal for nachos than Chili's. Those unlimited chips they make are basically PERFECT. It would be too good to be true if even the salsa was unlimited, but it's not, and that's okay. You can just order other dips or stick your chips in whatever other dishes you have on the table. Those chips are just these perfectly crispy, lightly salted, thin, crunchy triangles of goodness. You'd really want to stick around even just for that while watching big sports games on their big TV. *u* Great game day spot! Of course their menu of huge plates of yummy, super flavorful sandwiches, steaks, and many others will keep you happy too. Do not pass up the Burger Bites, these really tasty mini burgers and onion rings combo, the Chicken Crispers, and the fire-grilled quesadillas! All good for sharing! You always have fun at Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
7,Jezelle O.,"Maynila, Philippines",19,270,294,3.0,2015-05-06,"Chili's is literally the best representation of American dining. Everything about it just screams ""This is how America eats!!!"". But of course us Filipinos just love it. Chili's is supposed to be tex-mex style but honestly the flavours of their food don't scream tex-mex. That doesn't mean that it isn't good though. Chili's do serve pretty good food, especially their Country Fried Steak. Their mashed potato servings are one of the best mashed potatoes that I've ever eaten. You can just tell it's slathered with all that sinful butter. Chili's though is quite pricey, their average cost probably from P400-P600 per person. It does have family-sized servings so at least you can split costs. Chili's isn't ground breaking or anything but its comfortable enough in its solid identity. The American comfort food appeal doesn't get old and that's why they have been around all this time. People continue to crave for these stuff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
5,Lesley C.,"Maynila, Philippines",7,270,270,5.0,2015-05-14,"For a moment there, I thought Chili's was going to close down on me. It boomed in the 90s, slowed down and downsized, but now it's back. Can you believe I had to wait half an hour for a table on Friday night?  Oh Chili's, so many memories here. Always with friends - a birthday party, a barkada outing, tambay place because there's nowhere else open this late in Greenhills. Back when I used to have better metabolism, this is what I used to eat in one sitting: unlimited tostada chips (that's salsa AND skillet queso), a BOWL of Southwestern Vegetable Soup, grilled chicken and veggies AND the chocolate shake with sprinkles (They have no more sprinkles now. Sad face.) Other good stuff on the menu: the fajitas, pitcher of frozen strawberry margarita, Monterey chicken, chicken fingers, Old Timer. I LOVE their cheeseburgers.  Chili's is awesome. Go there. Make memories and things like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
4,Kevin J.,"Manila, Philippines",113,91,151,4.0,2015-06-07,How can you go wrong with Chili's?  I've been frequenting this branch since I was in third grade and their quality hasn't dipped at all! The big mouth bite burger has got to be my default go to burger any day of the week. It's loaded with cheese and bacon which is then sliced into four. Kinda pointless cause I would never share these. The onion bloom things are also so so good. We all know how good Chili's is and this branch is the living proof of that. Never had a bad or even a mediocre experience in this place.  Don't get me started in the Lava Cake or Hi and Mighty pie as well. If only I could have them both at the same time!  The unlimited Nachos is also a steal. They just seem to refill that baby up until everyone is sick of it. At P300? Yeah that's well worth it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
6,Pauline Y.,"Maynila, Philippines",132,752,283,5.0,2015-06-08,"Chili's is hands down one of my fave restaurants. Seriously! I love coming here for margarita night with friends, pigging out over their queso and tortilla chips, or having a seriously good and heavy meal with family. If you're craving for American/Mexican food with a twist, this is the place to go to satisfy those cravings. Chili's also serves killer smoothies and the ambiance is super fun. Some dishes that I would recommend if you're coming for the first time are the fish & chips, steak, burgers, chicken crispers, etc. Be sure not to miss out on the molten chocolate cake for dessert!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
3,Sofia R.,"Manila, Philippines",7,270,270,5.0,2015-06-13,"Chili's has got to be one of the best barkada hangout restaurants out there. As a La Salle Green Hills alumnus, my friends and I used to frequent here back when we were still in high school and I must say, it was quite the experience. From big burgers and chicken tenders to unlimited nachos, Chili's is a very good place to eat in, as it is jam packed with the good stuff.  Their menu offers a wide array of food. They've got appetizers (go for nachos or calamari!), chili (heh), salads, sandwiches, humongous burgers, pastas, good tasting ribs, grilled steaks, chicken, seafood, and a whole lot more! Not to mention that the serving for each one is ginormous, which makes everything a whole lot better.   In terms of its interior and its ambiance, I can say it's a pretty good one. You get a westernized space with a touch of Mexican here and there and it is pretty striking.   To sum it all up, yes, you have to eat in Chili's. They literally have mastered each dish they've got, plus they're in big servings. With good food in your hands paired up with a good space, you're bound to have a good time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
2,Mica V.,"Pasig, Philippines",113,32,61,4.0,2015-11-02,"Whenever my sister and I feel like having a major pig out session, this is where it happens. I love the good ol' American diner style comfort food that they serve, and how it comes in American sized portions too. We usually end up splitting at least one appetizer, one main and a dessert. I absolutely love their nachos (especially how they melt the cheese over every chip individually), but my all time favorite has to be their chicken fingers. These come with a generous side of fries and corn, and no one does the battering quite like they do. A mouthful of a freshly served, and thus, almost piping hot slice of chicken dipped in honey mustard, is enough to make me believe that everything is right again in the world.  Chili's is also the perfect place to have a chill drinking session with friends. The best part is they have bottomless tostada chips and salsa that everyone can share. I know they're just nacho chips, but theirs have a certain quality plus the absolute right texture and amount of crunch to set them apart. Come in October and they usually have an unlimited margarita promo. That's as much classic, strawberry, mango or strawberry-mango margaritas as you want for less than P400.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
1,Gabby A.,"Manila, Philippines",147,108,323,4.0,2016-03-24,"I like this place! It is right beside the sb I like to study at. I have only been to Chili's once in the states. I would say it is way better here. It was busy tonight because it's a holiday and a lot of restaurants are closed. We waited less than 10 minutes for a table. They have a lot of seating and a bar with tvs too.  I ordered a mango shake which was just OK, nothing special. Also got the bacon chicken ranch quesadilla. Which I really liked. They know how to make a a flavourful and filling quesadilla. It was pretty big and I only finished half.  I liked that our server came over to ask if we liked our food. I feel they don't ask that a lot in restaurants. They just serve your food and let you be. I think the food is kind if pricey as well but good portions at least. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
0,Dennis Carlson L.,"Manila, Philippines",62,281,1520,5.0,2016-03-25,"Chili's is always a good place to hang out and catch up with friends. I was surprised to see that the restaurant is full on a weeknight. I had a pleasant and comfortable first time visit to this branch (I am often at their Morato branch). I was the first to arrive among my friends and was seated to a confortable couch while the receptionist introduced to me our waiter. I was handed the menu and was introduced to their best-sellers and promos. Most restaurants I know would not even mention their promo, but they did. I was already hungry so I ordered their southwestern egg rolls to spend the time. Egg rolls is one of my favorite at Chili's. It is soft flour tortillas filled with beans, smoked chicken, corn, jalapenos jack cheese, red peppers and spinach, rolled and fried, then served with avocado-ranch dressing. It is cool and comforting to the mouth. After awhile, my friends arrived and we started ordering. We availed their Php999 promo of 1 appetizer and 2 entree of choice. We ended up ordering Wings over Buffalo, Fish and Chips, and Classic Chicken Fajita since it will be for sharing. The chicken drummettes are very flavorful and swert yet very spicy too. The fish comes in 3 giant pieces. They are soft and crispy but a bit too oily. The grilled chicken was good and everything blended well arpubd the flour tortilla. Halfway thrpugh our catching up, my phone died. Although there are available sockets around the restaurant, we sat from it. So I asked our server if I can give them my phone to charge and they willingly accepted it.  Overall, staffs are very attentive and fast. Food is good. The toilets are downstairs though. They also have a smoking area and a bar. Few parking spaces around but there is a parking lot across. Great place to hang out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-juan-4,,,,,
