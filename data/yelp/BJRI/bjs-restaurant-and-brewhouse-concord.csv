Naureen H.,"Martinez, CA",29,10,29,4.0,1/5/2018,"It's hard to review chain restaurants since one location might differ from other and that's the case for BJ's in my opinion. The last one i went to is in Cupertino and I remember getting good service and food. I believe that this location in Concord has room for improvement. It's by no means smaller or less busy than other locations. We usually sit in the bar area which has nice big screens. Since service is a hit or miss, we prefer the bar top so to get timely attention.  Food quality needs significant improvement and servers need to check back faster after food is dropped. I used to love their pizza but lately it's not been good and I just don't know what to expect. There were chunks of chicken of varying sizes in pizza. Once I got buffalo chicken pizza and it had bbq sauce in it. Jambalaya and Avocado egg rolls didn't disappoint though.  For drinks, it's safe to stick to beer which BJ's does well. I yet have to try their happy hour and lunch menu.  Food, drinks and service aside, I will always be back for pizookie while hoping that they will step up their overall game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord
Mister A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,3,1,5.0,12/28/2017,"Douglas, The manager was pretty cool and professional  He Helped us get a good seat when it was crowded. The food is good here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord
Chelsea H.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",21,27,13,2.0,12/19/2017,Honestly I'm not sure why I gave BJ's another chance. It had been over a year last I came here.  I'll start with the positive: drinks & food we're good. Table was clean.  Negative. Where do I start? From the server to the lack of customer service to waiting for plates and napkins and water! Totally ignored all night and our server clearly had some personal problem going on. We never could find him.  Our server was overwhelmed because all we saw him do was run ( literally running)  around the restaurant but not actually pay much attention to any tables. Ours especially. We were so ignored the whole night. Any request we had was always forgotten until we asked 2-3 more times. He seemed annoyed and flustered. My friend and I have worked in restaurants and retail so we can understand being overwhelmed however when we really looked around half his section was empty. We could hear other tables upset with his service and clearly he was paying attention and fooling around with one table more than the rest of ours.  Finally we get our check after being here for over 2 hours and we waited another 30 minutes just to PAY!! I flagged down someone else and she said she couldn't do it so finally we went to the front and pleaded for us to be able to pay so we could leave.   I don't even think the guy noticed we left the table he was hiding in the back so much.  I will never return here after this. Never. I'll chop my arm off before I come back here! Seriously pick ANYWHERE else in concord and pleasant hill and you'll get ten times better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord
Leeann P.,"Vallejo, CA",249,111,689,3.0,11/27/2017,"I used to love BJ's but i feel like the quality of the food here has gone down and extremely salty. I do appreciate their lunch menu on the weekdays though, that give a pretty good amount of food for the price.  Their avocado rolls are always on hit! Even though I'm always tempted to get a different appetizer, the avocado egg rolls are always a go-to. As far as drinks, I know this is a brewery but I'm not so much of a beer person so haven't tried any of those yet. But i have tried the mixed drinks and they are just not good at all. They're definitely on the weaker side. I got the margarita that was flat and then got a Long Island to try to get a buzz, and nothing. It's like the drinks were virgin and had no alcohol in them. That was a waste of $15. Anyway, BJ's is definitely known for their pazookies and i love those!!!!!! Whatever cookie you order is good! Tip: order ice cream on the side. That way your cookie doesn't get hard too fast ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord
Dana A.,"El Sobrante, CA",4,33,7,5.0,11/24/2017,"I've never had a problem with my food order. There's always something good to try.  My kids love the selection here and the crayons and activity menus. Pizookies are a must and child sundaes are cheap! Also just had great service from our server Daniel, he tastefully dressed his uniform with a few cool Disney pins.  He was very laid back and informative on the menu. He was able to check if I could order a dish that was once on the menu but that they no longer ""carry"". He was very polite and checked on our table frequently. Thanks Daniel!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord
Colin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,183,168,4.0,9/11/2017,"I have a hard time understanding why all the BJ's get 2.5-3 stars. They're all well above average! I am a bodybuilder and a true foodie. After my competitions, I insist on going straight to BJ's because it's one stop shopping for me. I typically get a small pizza, ribs with double fries, and the Pizookie Trio. They're all very tasty. If I went to a pizza place, maybe the pizza would be better. If I went to a BBQ place, maybe the ribs would be better. But everything is very solid and I am someone who is somewhat critical of food.  The service was also friendly and prompt.  My wife and I we're waiting on four other friends so we sat in the bar area when we initially got there. It was a Saturday night so they were on about a 60 minute wait. While in the bar, Carlos waited on us. He was super nice and took really good care of us. We ordered soft drinks and chips and guacamole. The chips were good, the guacamole was OK. I added some salt and it made it three times better. Shortly there after, our friends arrived and we went and got seated where all six of us could comfortably sit. We ordered a bunch of entrées and all kind of tried a little bit of each other's. The calamari was good, the bison burger was good. I thought my ribs were really good as always. The pizza was also very tasty per the usual.  One thing that I did differently this time was that we as a table got the pizookie platter (I think it was called) which was absolutely amazing. After having dieted for 20 weeks, I felt like I could eat three of them. It is huge, though. 20 bites in and I feel like I'm going into a food coma and a sugar high.  Anyways, you get the point. I'm a big fan of this place. We live in Vegas and have been to 2 locations here and have also been to locations in SoCal and now NorCal. If you haven't been, go!

Eric T.,"Antioch, CA",88,548,6990,3.0,11/7/2017,"Not a bad hippy place, but this place can be busy.

Adrianna T.,"Richmond, CA",211,66,192,4.0,8/18/2017,"I usually go here on a fluke, either for happy hour or because I'm craving a pizookie. Their happy hour is from 3pm-7pm I believe. They have draft beers and wine for less that $10, I think it was about $3-$6 per beer or wine. I know they also have cocktails on the happy hour, but I have yet to try one of them just because I don't really like mixed drinks.  As for their pizookie's... Orgasmic. I mean of course, you can make your own cookies and get some ice cream together. But it's not the same to me... The cookie is so moist and hot, it goes really well with the cold ice cream. They have oreo, chocolate chip, macadamian nut, red velvet flavors, etc... Red velvet is my favorite!  So far, the customer service has been great. I haven't had any complaints! Maybe next time I'll have an appetite and order something off the menu for a change, other than having dessert and alcohol lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord

Usually I only come on the weekends and that special is only for weekdays. I always just continuously order the tomato mozzarella salad (one of my favs) and the chicken tortilla soup. What made the experience more awesome was our server Daniel, who was quick and attentive and checked in on us enough that we weren't just sitting around waiting to order more.  He also was very patient with our table and the millions of questions we had for him. Some other good food options are the double bone in pork chop, the fried cheese curds (especially when they are hot) and the rib-eye steak holiday special.  And of course, their famous pazookie!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord

AnaLeesa W.,"Vallejo, CA",0,20,3,4.0,12/8/2017,"Me and my friend came here on a Thursday night. Upon walking in we were greeted by the host who was strictly only offering the bar/cafe area, as if she didn't want to seat tables in actual sections. Not sure what that was all about but i requested a booth in a regular section. The party ahead of us had a confusion about bar seating too. But it all worked out after that.  Our server was busy but still managed to meet our every need. I had the tomato bisque and a cesar salad which were both very good. I also had the fried artichoke hearts and I wasn't wowed by them. They were just ok. I wish I would have got the Brussels sprouts instead. That will be something to try for next time. My friend had the brisket burger and an Alabama Sunset. The plate looked good for the price and the drink was pretty strong and had a really good taste. We ended our dinner with a mini monkey bread pizzookie and I have to say that it was the best part. Sooo good, and even the mini was just enough to share. I will be back here to try more menu items. Thank You BJ's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord
Renee F.,"Sacramento, CA",35,154,148,3.0,8/14/2017,"Typical chain restaurant atmosphere. This isn't the one I usually go to but I've been here 4 or 5 times. I've always had good service and even if a mistake is made it is quickly resolved. It's at the mall so it's usually packed, but in my experience the wait has never been more than 20 min. I recommend downloading the app and adding your name to the preferred waitlist or calling ahead to add your name, that helps a lot. The deep dish pizza is always good but now that I'm working to stay low carb these days I like the salmon, blackened. I don't like the broccoli here (this time around was my second time giving it a chance) but I love the asparagus. Next time around I'll be subbing double asparagus with my meal. I'm sure I'll be back. If you're meeting people on a weekend get there a little early to find a parking spot.

Service was fine, it wasn't slow, though it was weird that we had to flag someone down for ketchup considering we had french fries.  Shouldn't it come automatically with ketchup? I had the prime rib dip sandwich.  It tasted ok, the meat was basically roast beef.  The au jus provided was salty but not much flavor.  It was a tad skimpy on the meat as about 1/4 of my sandwich didn't have any meat on it.  The fries were really good- skinny, had a nice crisp to them.  It was about $13-$14 so quite pricey.   Other people in my party had spaghetti (didn't look appetizing at all) and tacos (looked pretty good).   In the end, it wasn't bad though its a typical chain restaurant.  Basically a higher end, more expensive Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=20

One of my fav's is the chicken alfredo pasta. AMAZING!!! As far as the pizookie, I get traditional chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream but if you're sharing, I recommend getting the 3 in 1.

Katie E.,"Clayton, CA",167,1,,3.0,1/9/2018,"I am writing this review in regards to a few of the past experiences I've had at this establishment. The issues with the customer service experience begin at the start of entering the restaurant. The very last time I went, we put in our name and number and were told to expect about a 20 minute wait. About 30 minutes went by and we decided to check and see where our name was on the list. They very clearly had no idea what we were talking about, and instead of admitting a possible mistake, they ignored us. I assumed they were just going to discuss with the waitress if there any availability so I sat down and waited. A few minutes later they took us to a table and gave us our menus. Now, the service to get our orders taken has been consistently unacceptable. It was 10 o'clock at night and the restaurant was only about a quarter full, yet it took 10 mins for the waitress to simply take our drink order, and about 45 mins for the food to arrive. Now, the exception I have is the food has always been phenomenal. I have ordered many different things off their wonderfully extensive menu and they all have been delicious as well as reasonably priced. It is why I keep coming back despite the poor customer service. After we finished our meals, our waitress was no where to be found, and all we wanted was our check. We didn't end up leaving the restaurant until midnight. My suggestions would be to give waitress smaller sections so they can dedicate more time to their tables. The food here is great and if you improve on your customer service and being more present/available to the customer, I would frequent this restaurant much more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=20

My friend ordered the tacos, which she thought were pretty tasty and I chose the blackened salmon with veggies and mashed potatoes.

David F.,"Concord, CA",53,375,1603,3.0,12/11/2016,"Stopped by recently on a late Friday afternoon after catching a movie in Pleasant Hill. I had been anxious to try the Concord BJ's clam chowder as the same dish in the San Rafael BJ's had been fantastic. When we got there we were seated immediately as there were plenty of open tables, more people being in the bar area. But the restaurant quickly filled up and by 6:15 it was packed and hopping. One thing we were surprised by was the lack of Holiday decorations, this being early December. A handful of poinsettias scattered around was the sole nod to the season. My order of the clam chowder in a sourdough bowl was as good as I remembered it. The chowder was excellent, and if possible, the bread was even better - freshly baked sourdough worthy of a meal unto itself! My wife had the Vegetarian Pita Tacos, and although the pita was excellent, the meal itself was too oniony. For dessert we decided to try their ""world-famous"" pizookie, which is a freshly baked cookie in a miniature round pizza tin, topped by ice cream and sauce. Not cheap at seven dollars, so we split the triple chocolate pizookie. We were somewhat disappointed by this world-famous dessert. The cookie was good, not great, and the chocolate ice cream was nothing special, tasting like grocery store ice cream.  The sauce, from Ghirardelli chocolate, was the high point. While we were eating a couple of large groups were seated in our area, and our server was tasked with the table of 12. Alas, that was the last we saw of him, and after a long wait we finally flagged down someone to get the bill, and after another wait, finally snagged someone else to take our card. That was a little annoying, and made me realize I would never want to come here prior to a Friday night event where I had to be somewhere at a given time. Although my meal was excellent, five stars, my wife's meal, the dessert, and the long wait at the end knocks Concord BJ's down a couple stars unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=20
Elijah B.,"Martinez, CA",200,362,440,3.0,6/11/2017,"This place is always a good place to go IF you have a small party (less than 5), and the service is adequate enough to get you by.  Service when it is busy, slow, or in between, is usually always, the same, which is odd to me. Doesn't matter what time of day or how busy it is, the service is usually the same, in terms of time. The food comes out a bit slow, but if you're at the open bar, it is a bit faster. I recommend the open bar do to the fact that you can get seated faster.

My son got the corn dogs and French fries, but, was very tired & sleepy.  So, after he ate his meal, he fell asleep on me,  and that's why he didn't want to sit in the high chair,  he already had his own agenda,  he wanted to sleep on me, while we ate. The service was good,  our Waitress, kept coming back to check on us, to see if we needed anything, and check with us, on our meals and drinks.  We were full,  but, got the pizookies for dessert - ""To go"". You can't come here without having the dessert. I got the Chocolate Chip with the French Vanilla Ice Cream and my hubby got the Triple Chocolate Chip and the Ghirardelli Chocolate Ice Cream.

Similar atmosphere to the Cheesecake Factory with way better service. What sells me on this is the service though. We were a party of 6, and we got sat next to an older gentleman that elbowed my friend's son in the back of the head a few times. After asking him to stop, the guy gave us trouble. Management swoops in to the rescue and got us moved. He checked in on my friend and his son to make sure everything was okay. Overall- They saved what could have been a really bad night for my friend's son (12 years old and not really able to handle this 40-50 year old macho guy whacking him in the back of the head because he wanted to put his arm around someone..) 10/10 would be back.

Got there around 7:30pm... our party had been seated already and already had appetizers. Everything was fine at that point. Our server took our orders right away and everything was noted around 7:45pm or so. Our server went on break and then Mother's Day went from pretty good (The Warriors won!) to something that free Pizzokies all around couldn't even fix. An hour later, around 9:00pm, our food started coming in 15 minute intervals. Awkward when you're waiting for everyone's food to get on the table. But wait, here's the kicker... my mom (whose ""Day"" it happens to be) got her food last. Yikes! Food was cold, food was messy. People who were seated after and around us were already done with their meals and paying their bills.

Melissa T.,"Contra Costa, CA",42,101,222,3.0,6/10/2016,"So it's a Friday basically morning we arrive at 10:57 am and I was under the impression oh we have a few minutes til they open. Go inside with half of our party and realize the place is pretty empty so no biggie. We let the hostess know that we have a group of 13 coming from an 8th grade graduation. They let us know they're getting the table together. Gotcha.  So I run down to forever 21 real quick while the tables getting set and the rest of our group arrives. And I spent a good 15-20 mins in the store. So my niece and I rush back to our group thinking man they've probably already ordered..right? Soooo not the case. After I settle I ask what you guys order. And I get a look back at me that made me realize something is not right. Come to find out no waiter have been introduced neither has anyone asked for a drink order from us or even come by to check on us.  To fast forward after two personal face to face attempts and a phone call that was put on hold to figure out what's going on. Do we have a waiter ? Is there an issue? We get nothing in return. Not even a courteous do you need help from neighboring waiters.  It truly felt they were all ignoring us because we were staring each and every waiter down. So I go to the bar and actually ask a bartender for water for our table. And she thought I asked for a water for myself. And I reiterated that we all needed water for the table because after 30 mins we still haven't had a server approach us.  Once I sat, a waiter who apparently just so happen to be in that area where we were seated noticed how famished we were. Asked if we needed anything? And we told him actually can you wait on us as a joke. He said he actually was going to wait on us but was told not to someone else was going to. So he said forget it I'll do it. We all started clapping, thanks to Saul or Sal!! He was excellent and didn't get anything wrong. As he was taking our drink orders the lovely bartender I spoke with prior had waters for us. And asked have we been taken care of? By the time we got our drink orders in, groups that arrived after us already boxed up their food. Which made us very upset. Again never upset at Saul he was on point although the the orders took a minute but by this time the restaurant went from 5 groups of her than us to near full capacity.  I can't say if I'll ever return to this location it was so exhausting. We had two kids with us under the age of 7 and they both became very uneasy and irritable because they were even thirsty or hungry or tired of waiting. And a pregnant woman too. It was exhausting for ALL of us. I hope they really do fix this issue. Don't wish this on anyone. Everything we got was a process. A loooooong process. Not the drinks tho just everything else. I hadn't leave early to get to work but before we had to wait more than 30 mins for the bill.

It is Tuesday, November 3rd.  I called in to reserve a table for 10 on Saturday, November 7th.  The employee I spoke with, said her manager communicated that there are no tables available.  I find it hard to believe, that this massive chain restaurant is unable to accommodate me.  Besides the large parties they're currently accommodating, I'm assuming they must prepare for walk - ins. Unless they plan on turning people away?  The last time I came here (about a week ago); I asked the hostess if we could sit at a table closer to the TV (MNF)?  She said no, kept running back and forth for permission.  She refused to sit us at the tables I requested.  She kept mumbling reasons that made no sense.  It was as though seating 2 people was the most complicated and difficult task.

On Monday night it was my friends 21st birthday, and he absolutely loves BJs and would eat there everyday if he could. Anyways, as we seated ourselves at the bar, 5 of us, we were asked what to drink, or should I say some of us were asked what we want to drink. Okay, whatever, no biggie. Then it took foreverrrrrr to find our waiter. Okay, finally she came, took our order and went on with her life again. Mind you, it is about 10pm and it was very slow. Then she comes later and asked if we need utensils.... what do you mean do we need utensils?!? I guess we're supposed to eat our soup and salad with our hands... Before out food came she brought us the dirties/wettest plates ever and only brought four. Seriously you would think she is blind by the fact that she didn't see the food crumbs and how greasy the plate were. Then, out comes the food, from a nice woman by the name of Marsha(i think) and she asks us if we need anything and made sure everything's ok, now the birthday boy says, ""why can't she be our waiter?"" As we were about to eat our food we realize... we DO NOT have utensils... They also forgot my soup and it was cold... Onto dinner, the food was absolutely great as always, then we realized our drinks have been empty for quite some time now. Eventually enough was enough, so my friend, having experience in serving customers decides to ask for a manager, and boy was he an unapologetic a**. He sarcastically said, ""is here anything else that I can get you that you didn't get?"" Not once an apology, I almost wanted to ask for his manager. I guess when the manager is more like your friend you get away with giving shitty service. Then TIFFANI(our waiter) walks by and ask another waiter, ""Do you need help?"" WTF, what do you mean do she need help? YOU NEED HELP. We need help.  Okay, so to conclude my essay, the waiter, who finally came out from hiding asks the birthday boy would he like a pizookie....................and he says no!!! wtf, what do you mean no?!?! He loves pizookies, but that literally how shitty our server was, she sucked the enthusiasm out of us, he couldn't even find her to order his first legal drink! So as you may know, when the check comes, they are sooooo nice. And sadly, me being me, still persuaded my friends to give her a 15% percent tip.......

Rachel Ann C.,"Irvine, CA",416,303,1459,3.0,8/15/2014,"I've been here several times over the years and my experience has always been inconsistent. It's mostly about the customer service. Employees will forget about my table sometimes, neglect to come back or take my order, forget to get my beer. Other times, they are extremely friendly and courteous and are willing to serve you. I've had a waitress one time who seemed like she was flirting with a customer in the bar. Same goes for another guy serving a table of girls. Service aside, the food is standard BJ's. Their appetizers and entrees tend to run HUGE. Just look at the calorie count--it's definitely something NOT for one person. I tend to split the bigger entrees and pastas with another person as it's enough for two. The appetizers are DEFINITELY shareable between 3+ people. If you're looking for a more personalized one-person or small group appetizer, go for the Snacks and Small Shares portion of the menu. You'll definitely save your appetite and money. Most of their foods are huge, greasy and packed with flavor which makes you fill up. Not entirely healthy but... It is BJ's. Since it is a brewhouse, they have such a great selection of beers. For a light beer-cider blend, I love their Black Velvet beer. It's a nice brew of their BJ's Porter (coffee-chocolate-malt roast) and Cider blend. It's sweet but balanced well with their dark brew. I've heard of their other beers as well and people tend to generally enjoy them--just find what suits you! Overall, mediocre experiences altogether. Pizookies are usually a guilty pleasure and you can never go wrong if you're ready to indulge in those. A restaurant and brewhouse that packs on the flavors and sizes in their foods, good happy hour with a great beer selection, and mediocre service.

He returned with another server with our drinks and informed he was going on break and she will take care of us.

Yes, the people are nice... but that just doesn't do it for me. Seems like they have new servers every time I go, but thats fine. They always forget napkins/utensils, I have to ask twice for water, and its hard to catch a server to ask for little things. (Such as ranch or sauce etc).

After  being seated we experienced great service especially because children can be challenging.

He offered for me to come grab it, but that was not going to happen.  2-He brings our order and comes without change on him. One would think they could come prepared to make the transaction smooth and quick.  3-I was about to walk in when I realize 1 order is wrong, but he came out. Without an apology for the incorrect order, he goes back to fix it.  4-Now my ice cream is melted and one person will have to reheat their food.  Food is ok, but reheating could have been the issue.

Jeannie T.,"Oakland, CA",90,226,913,3.0,7/6/2015,"I used to love to come to BJ's but my most recent experience here was lacking. The service was great and our server, MacKenzie, was extremely helpful, but the food didn't wow me like it usually does. I'm not much of a drinker period so I asked our server which one she recommended. She steered me towards the Tickle Me Pink which I ended up ordering, but once I tried it, I really did not like it. MacKenzie was a doll and offered to take it off the menu in exchange for a different drink. I took her offer and ordered BJ's berry burst cider, which tasted so much better. I'd definitely recommend it. It's light and sweet but decent enough for someone like me with a really low tolerance to drink.  In terms of food, our group ordered the chicken wings in spicy and Parmesan, avocado egg rolls, fries, and the flatbread to share. I have nothing bad to say about the appetizers except that the avocado egg rolls are executed better at CPK and the Cheesecake Factory.  For my entree, I ordered the Asian chicken salad. The salad looked really pretty and tasted good. I ate the whole thing, but then again, I really love salads. My boyfriend ordered the mahi mahi. The couscous was cooked well, but the fish was tough and overcooked. At first, the tomato sauce paired well with the fish and couscous but the more you ate it, the acidity from the tomatoes became too much and it started to taste like the acidic bile from when you throw up. Pretty gross. Also, my friends ordered the shrimp scampi and the bison burger. According to them, the shrimp scampi was too dry with very little sauce and the bison burger was overcooked. The only thing that tasted good was the pizza.  Lastly, the pazookie is always good. We ordered the pazookie trio with chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia, and cookies n cream. All were yummy.

Monica J.,"San Pablo, CA",1,3,1,2.0,2/20/2017,"After shopping at the mall for a couple of hours, my family and I worked up an appetite and decided to have BJ's for dinner. It was a Sunday evening so we imagined it would be somewhat busy but not 30 minutes wait-time busy (there were plenty of tables open from what we could see.)  Once we were finally seated, it took about 5 minutes to actually get a server come to our table. When he came back to our table with our drinks, he placed the drink on the uneven table and accidentally spilled my fathers drink and it fell all over his lap and phone. Luckily no damage, just a bit of stickiness, but we understand accidents happen. The bus boy was a great deal of help! After the spill ordeal, we were ready to order. The server had pens and notepads in his pockets but as we were giving him our orders, he never wrote anything down; pretty weird especially since it was a busy night and he was serving other tables but I just relied on his good memory I guess. My parents ordered soup and salad combos so their meals came out in a fairly average wait time. As my parents are getting through their meals, our server finally came with my plate but instead of the sirloin steak, he brought me a huge rib-eye steak. When I told him that's not what I ordered, he seemed confused and said that he could've sworn I said rib-eye and even look at his ""empty"" notepad. So as my parents finish their food, I finally received my meal but at that point it was already late and I had to rush through it; not even able to enjoy it. The only good thing about this experience was that I had a $5 off $25 coupon. I think it's better to play it safe and take the extra second to write down orders and that way you won't waste food/time and get things wrong in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=160

Myra V.,"Martinez, CA",86,22,26,2.0,4/20/2015,"I'm just going to get to the point in saying that I've always liked the food here. It's ok, pretty good. Every once in a while I'll crave a pizookie and come by with my family.  BUT THEN we'll come in and the service is so bad that it'll remind us why we don't come in so often.  We prob haven't been to this location in over a year prior to today's visit. The service was just as bad back then.  Today our server was Katie. We've seen her here over a year ago so she's been around for a while. We used to see her in the bar area but I guess she's serving on the lower dining area now. We arrived at approx. 7:45pm and didn't leave until approx 9:10pm. We were seating for at least ten minutes before they took our order or even brought waters over. We ordered an appetizer (carnitas fries, they prob weren't worth the $6), a pizza to share, my son ordered a kids meal, and we shared a pizookie at the end.  When ordering, I asked Katie to tell me what was on one of the pizzas featured on the table that wasn't in the menu (I think it was called the Prime Veggie?), and she had no idea but pulled an answer out of her ass. She proceeded to ask me ""What DON'T you like, and I'll tell you if it's on there?"" I didn't have an answer for her but I told her I just wanted it to have artichokes. She confidently said that it did so I ordered it, but of course we later found out that it did NOT have artichokes. She didn't come by the table very much, and when she did we asked her for two ranch dressings. She only brought one. When we reminded her about the second one, she never brought it.  We didn't order much but it took SO LONG for us to be served. I understand that sometimes it may be a little busy, but the service was bad as soon as we sat down. Another thing that irritated me was that for some reason the table next to us that arrived after we did (and had a bigger party than us) received their check before we did! UGH. I had to calm my boyfriend down because he was ready to just get up, leave, and tell the people in the front that Katie was taking too long to come by with our check.  Bj's is nice, but not this location. The service here is horrible, and has been for years. Only come if you're not in a rush or have nothing to do for the rest of your night. And Katie-- I've worked in the restaurant industry before, where I've had to know what came with every single menu item and combination we offered. We know you're not new here, so I suggest you step your customer service game up. I apologize if this is harsh, but I believe that you did NOT deserve the 15% that I tipped you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=160
Teasha S.,"Denver, CO",235,58,1,4.0,3/3/2016,"I moved to the East Bay last year from Reno and I ALWAYS went to BJ's up there, but the negative reviews for the BJ's around here have caused me to stay away until recently... I'm glad I gave it a shot, because they did just fine and I missed their pizzas, dammit. We came here on a weekday evening this week and I believe our server was named Emily.  She was attentive, quick, and efficient, and even made sure to put the half of the pizza with mushrooms facing my boyfriend (lol) since I ordered my half without. She seemed genuinely happy to help and it made me regret not trying the local BJ's here sooner.   Give them a shot! Just remember that lunchtimes are busy, as are weekends, and the service might be slower at that time. Also, I think it's really weird that multiple Yelpers are complaining about Pizookies. I could not care less if a pizookie is kind of stuck to the cookie sheet.  I would annihilate that thing anyway.

Steve B.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",103,206,120,1.0,7/7/2016,"Super disappointed with the hostess. She took my name and said it would be a about 10-15 minute wait. After waiting about 10 minutes I started to notice that people that got there after us were being seated.  I asked the same hostess about the status of our wait to which her answer was ""we already called you.""  I told her that she did not call me since we were standing right by the hostess stand and we did not hear her call my name. I did hear her say to another host to ""call Steve"" but he never did (I thought there may have been another party named Steve). I told her that I heard her conversation with the other host and he never called my name. Her reply to me was ""we'll seat you as soon as possible.""  I looked at the other host and said, I said you never called Steve. His response was we'll seat you as soon as possible. No apologies, no I'm sorry or anything. They both acted as if they were dismissing my concern.  We decided to stay because we were hungry. After being sat 5 minutes later we were seated. Unfortunately, either the server was having a bad day or they hostess and host told him about our interaction. Our server had a nonchalant attitude. He was slow and it was another 10-15 minutes before we finally got our food.  Fortunately, he was phased out and sent home and we had a different server. Our new server was 100% better. He was friendly and be took care of us. We took care of him by ensuring he got to keep the tip (cash- which was well over 25% of the bill), and he did not tip out the other server, hostess or hosts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=80

April B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,19,,2.0,11/12/2017,"I first experienced this place about a month ago at about 3:00 on a weekday afternoon when not many people were there.  I sat at the bar area for about 20 minutes, and no one ever took my order.  Lots of servers standing around socializing, though.  I asked to be re-seated in the main dining area where I was promptly served.  The food was okay, so I decided to give it another chance.   Fast forward to today, Sunday early afternoon with a 10-15 minute wait. I took my mother and her roommate.  Both are in their 80's and live in an assisted living facility.  One walks with a cane and the other with a walker.  Both are obviously frail. No one seemed willing to give up their seats in the waiting area, so I asked the greeter if there was somewhere my mother and her friend could sit while we wait for our table.  The greeter said she would get 2 chairs.  I waited a few minutes and asked again, as it appeared she had forgotten.  She had not forgotten and said she'd take care of it.  She never did, and she never asked her co-workers for assistance. I approached another worker for assistance who told me that another man had approached the manager and was taking care of it. That other man was a customer who had watched the entire interaction.  He carried the chairs over and seemed just as disgusted as I was.  Meanwhile, the greeter that I initially approached remained oblivious.  When we were finally called to be seated, they seated us in an area near the bar that required going up steps. No harm was intended, but I was irritated by this point, especially since there were lots of empty tables in the main dining area with no steps.  We were re-seated, and the service was decent from that point on.  For that reason, I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. This is a place that clearly caters to much younger, able-bodied people.  What a sad statement about their service. I just can't see myself returning when their are other comparable restaurants nearby that demonstrate far greater sensitivity toward the elderly and disabled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=80

The sad fact is that they don't care about any of these things, but will take your time and money and leave you with un-edible, subpar food. We ordered a classic burger that was so black, it didn't even resemble meat of any kind.  Nor did the lettuce they put on top that was so brown and wilted.  House sirloin steak was literally about 2 1/2 inches in size and thought it must be either a joke or a child's portion.  The asparagus that came with it was so overcooked, the poor stalks were limp and bent over.  And don't even get me started on the chicken club sandwich, that was neither recognizable as chicken or a sandwich. Dry, stale, rubbery chicken, with none of the avocado or cheese it was promised, but did include more of the brown and wilted lettuce, because we just didn't get enough the first time on our burger.

We were waiting for an hour and a half - the AC was blasting, we were chilling while waiting for our food and throughout dinner.

And Because el tapatio closed at 9 and Lucille's has their own problems... Anyways we go in to get seated and of course there's like 15 empty tables but we have to wait to be seated... We get seated and we have a nice waitress who brings us our drinks and appetizer. The appetizer was calamari and it was okay, not exactly fresh. My parents ordered some beers and it took hella long to get them. We get our food and everything is okay until I try my Mac and cheese. I realize it had a weird taste of cheese.... Kind of like NACHO CHEESE. What the fuck??? I have noodles with fucking nacho cheese?? What the actual fuck man...  If you look at the picture you can see the little spices that are usually seen in NACHO CHEESE, the CHEESE YOU EAT WITH NACHOS AND NOTHING ELSE. Also, I ordered their bacon Mac and cheese and had no bacon on my plate, so they brought me a cup of bacon... In which I found a hair!! The my parents ordered two more beers and it took over 30 minutes to receive them. And we also asked for ketchup 3 times and instead had to have my boy Friend look around and find a ketchup.  Needless to say this place was not packed at all... And every other table was receiving the same service. Ridiculous. Do not eat here. The manger came up and offered to take the Mac and cheese off the check which is good... But looked at me dumb when I told him it was Nacho Cheese. Everyone at the table who tried it said it was nacho cheese... I'm so appalled because Mac and cheese is my favorite and I have never been disappointed by it :( until now.

Desiree N.,"American Canyon, CA",1,20,14,1.0,2/5/2017,"Please please please please please save yourself and avoid this BJ's restaurant at all costs. Let me tell you, I've been here about three times in my nineteen years of living and I've had bad experiences all three times, but let me tell you about the last time I went.  So my friends and I were hungry and Lucille's was closed so we decided to go to BJ's, that was our first mistake. We were seated promptly and everything was going okay until we got our food. There were four of us and NOT ONE item was cooked correctly. I got soup in a bread bowl, the soup was cold and the bread bowl was burnt, so burnt that I could not break into it with my teeth at all. One of my friends got an artichoke dip and the chips were stale and the dip was crusting/burnt, we didn't know how it was possible to screw up a dip but okay! My other friend ordered a pasta and it had NO TASTE, we all tried it and none of us could eat it. So we called the waiter over and complained, she had an attitude even though we kindly explained to her that this food was something that a dog wouldn't dare touch. I knew that she would be no help so I told her to call her manager. The manager came over and was kind enough to have our food remade. Two of my friends were so disappointed that they didn't want their food remade so the manager agreed to have the food that we didn't eat removed from the check. The second batch that came out was great, food that we should've got the first time around, but we were happy that they finally got it right. However, when it was time to pay for the check, all hell broke loose. Our evil waiter carried her attitude the whole night and almost exploded when we asked to split the check and remove the food that we didn't eat from the check (keep in mind, the manager previously agreed). On the way out, we asked for our change (that our waiter neglected to return to us) and the waiter literally starting YELLING about how much of an inconvenience we were. It was so embarrassing and I couldn't BELIEVE what was happening. Almost everyone in the restaurant turned to look at us and as much as we wanted our change, we couldn't stand the negative attention so we simply left. As someone who has worked in food service for almost four years, I couldn't understand how she could do such a thing to paying customers, and get away with it. I called corporate and my call was never returned. There's not much I can do but I will make sure to pray for that girl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=180

I hadn't ever been to this particular BJ's, I knew it was by the mall...but I didn't know if it was on the other side of the freeway with all the other restaurants. Note: it's connected to the mall.  Since it was so late, the dining room was closed and only serving in the bar area. That was fine, there was a good amount of people sitting in there. Service was a little on the slow side at first, but once our waitress came, it picked up.  My boyfriend and I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, wings and a flatbread pizza. The spinach and artichoke dip, we could have passed on. It was like it had been sitting out from earlier and they threw it in the microwave and reheated it. It was a weird quiche-like texture, instead of a creamy dip, like texture. I suppose that's what happens when you go to a restaurant late. The wings, we ordered half and half, different sauces. I got the garlic parmesean and my boyfriend got some hot buffalo flavored sauce. I liked mine, they were good with ranch. You do have to ask for an extra side of ranch though, if you have two different flavors because they only give you one.  The flatbread pizza was okay. A little more greasy than I remembered from other locations, but overall we liked it. Our waitress was really nice. It was my birthday, so she made sure to bring out a personal sized pizookie.  I understand that going to businesses close to when they're closing can change your experience a little bit.

Pizza - meh.  It came in a pan and was kind of like deep dish, but I wouldn't really recommend it unless you had a serious hankering for some pizza. Ahi salad - decent Pizookie - this thing was pretty freaking great.  A hot cookie in small pan with ice cream on top.

They had arrived earlier and put their name on the queue for a table.  When we arrived they had just down and ordered.  Service for us was just as quick but I guess that doesn't count because we didn't have to wait.   Girlfriend and her son split the classic burger . I had a similar burger with fries. Everything was great.  And although someone technically paid the bill, I added my BJs loyalty membership number onto the check and they gave me credit without having my member card on hand.  Nice touch, on top of quick service at the busy time.

Nowhere in the 20-page menu does it describe their soups, nor the fact that the tortilla soup is garnished with the vile herb, cilantro. Once that was remedied, the soup was the best thing we got. Mediterranean Chicken Pita was HORRIBLE. Raw, doughy pita, 4 pieces of chicken and cubes of tomato, onion, and cucumber. Yawn. Don't be fooled by the wild grain salad, it's mostly mushy quinoa. The rest of the overpriced meal was about the same. Pan pizza was meh, we'll get Round Table next time. Driest, toughest ribeye ever. Yuck. $4 for a dinky side salad.

As usual, the Bloody Mary was absolutely delicious. My steak came with a choice of two sides, I chose a baked potato and brussel sprouts. I ordered my steak rare and boy did they deliver! most places totally fail at preparing my steak as rare as I like it, but BJs knows exactly how to prepare a rare steak! My friend also ordered a steak, she got hers medium rare and she said it was cooked perfectly too. For one of her sides she ordered the Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad which I tried I couple bites of, it was pretty good, the onions were a tad overpowering in my opinion. Our server Mackenzie was really attentive and was so sweet about me asking for extra sour cream and chives for my baked potato twice. The first time she brought us steak-sauce, the bottle was pretty much empty and when we asked for another one, the second one was empty as well. We laughingly said screw it and ate our steaks without any steak-sauce and we actually didn't really need it. The steaks were so flavorful and juicy that I think that the steak-sauce would have taken away from that.  The steaks here are really great and priced really well.

They have very tasty shoestring fries for the kids at .95 cents it is a good deal, too. They also have kids cups. ODDLY our waitress brought us double what we ordered for the kids, she may have smoked a joint prior to her shift... I really like their beverage menu and famous pazookies. Unfortunately when I ordered mine it was touch and not ooey gooey chewy deliciousness I had hoped for. The small bites and salads loom healthy and tasty, with unique offerings. The stuffed mushrooms were delightful and packed with flavor, but again thrown onto the plate. They are big of flavor... However, we went when it was slow. Not busy at all, during the day...so I do not see why our meals were rushed and sloppily plated. I would like to make my way back there and give it a second chance.

Emily L.,"Martinez, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/22/2017,"I don't know why there are so many reviews about bad customer service at this location. I come here with a group of friends one to two times a week on average because they're the best. The food is not only fantastic and whether they mess up and bring you the wrong plate or they find something in the food. Accidents happen and it's a food establishment........ and they DO care and will handle your situation timely and appropriately but it's very rare that they do mess up because they're great! The service I would say is a big reason why we all choose to come back every week. You not only want to try everything on the menu because it is reasonably priced and looks great, but the way they treat you and care about you as a person not only a customer is hard to come by! Once you walk in the door you're most likely greeted by Katie the hostess with a welcoming smile and a genuine hello. Her and the other hosts/hostesses do their best to seat you in a reasonable time frame depending on the night you're dining with them always keeping you updated on the status of your wait and you can see them making sure you are taken care of. She really welcomes you and makes you feel like your business is really appreciated and it's a nice beginning to your night out! Once you're seated if you get Hailey as a waitress you are SETTTTTTT for a great dinner. One of the BEST waitresses I would say that I've ever had the pleasure in being helped by. She too will kindly greet you with a genuine smile and ask you how you're doing. She always makes sure that you have drinks, your food and that you are doing great overall. She also really cares about you as a person, always keeping a smile on her face as she asks you about your day and what she can do to make your visit great. You can also see her working extremely hard on the floor waiting several tables on a busy night but she never neglects one table over the other, making sure everyone is taken care of. Super professional but also funny and fun to have as a waitress! And even if it is a busy night she'll always be super generous, helpful and informative to you and your table because she wants you to have a great experience. Incredible service, go in and request if she's there you won't regret it. If you get Mia as a waitress you're golden as well because she too always makes sure that you're not only handled in a timely fashion but she lets you know that you're appreciated and that even though she's waiting other tables, when she's with you, you are at the top of her priority list. She also really knows what she's talking about when it comes to questions on the menu or anything in general and she again like Hailey always makes sure that you above all are doing good and enjoying your time. She's also extremely patient, looking at their menu can be tough because everything looks so good and she will help you sort out your options and offer to wait as long as you need to make your decision. There's no rush or pressure when you're being helped by her she's just super nice, fun and respectful. Wonderful service as well, definitely would recommend her too! Gabby as well is another great, fast and a wonderful server to have! She too is informative, nice, friendly and cares about you and who you're with making sure that you're not waiting too long and that you're always happy with your meal and your time in the restaurant. They're all so great at what they do, and make the experience of coming here so much more fun and overall better!  I have always had extremely positive and great experiences when I come here and I truly look forward to it every week as it has become a weekly meeting spot for my friends and I to come out on the days they have great deals which is basically everyday, seriously get out there and look them up, you will be there every week too they're so great. The service is wonderful and again is what makes us want to come back and look forward to returning week after week. They may have a few servers that are not as great, but that's what really makes you value your time with the hosts, hostesses, waiters and waitresses who are above and beyond at their job! Also if there ever is an issue remember that people make mistakes and that it's a food business where nobody is always perfect and they do handle any complaint or dissatisfaction timely and are truly sorry and offer you something in return to make sure again that YOU are happy. They're all human, cut a little slack on the harsh reviews, they do a fantastic job at this establishment.

Our first server was a gentleman, very nice and patient, and we were a big party of more than twelve, with some seniors and rowdy children. I applaud him for his outstanding patience. It was the other server, a young woman who was very rude and just utterly horrible to us that ruined a perfectly good Sunday lunch. She raised her voice while addressing some of our desserts and just was a totally horrible server, with an equally repulsive attitude. If I'm not mistaken her name was Justine.

Janice J.,"Concord, CA",134,26,47,3.0,3/23/2016,"3/22/16 came here randomly at around 9 on a Tuesday. The restaurant wasn't busy and we got a table after a couple minutes of entering. We ordered: ravioli, Siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese, jambalaya and spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza.  The ravioli was good, the cheese was delicious and I would definitely order it again. The Siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese wasn't that great. It was a new dish of theirs. It wasn't really Mac n cheese used penne noodles, sauce was watery and there was no spiciness to it. It was just edible. Jambalaya was great. It was spicy, salty and just fulfilling. I don't mind the saltiness but my uncle didn't like it said it was too salty.  The spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza was okay. It wasn't spicy, had jalapeños on it to make it spicy and the sauce on it...what sauce? I hardly tasted any sauce. It wasn't really a deep dish pizza if you know what I mean? It was just deep because of the thick dough. Idk I guess I'm used to Chicago deep dish pizza. I wish we had ordered a different kind but my uncles friend doesn't like pepperoni!?!?! Whatever. The waiter was friendly, he did his job well.

Jay G.,"Clayton, CA",1,24,,4.0,12/5/2016,"BJ's is a great place to eat casual dinners. You can sample the starters and the side dishes and come away completely satisfied without even ordering an entrée. The beer selection is very good, with both in-house and other common beers from which to chose.  We usually head to the bar area where the tables are first-come available. There are probably 10 TV moniters spaced throughout the restaurant. The sound quality is very good, easy to carry on a conversation without shouting. There seem to be several wait staffers, but the bar area always has too few, so these poor girls are running all night just trying to keep up. If the kitchen misses something (like sauce for the wings), you will wait quite a while for the waters to cycle back to you. Empty beer glasses sit for a long time before you are offered another one.  All that, but the food is very good, dependable everytime we re-visit.

Concerned C.,"Martinez, CA",2,35,,2.0,4/13/2016,"SUMMARY: My best guess is poor management with no leadership. EXPLANATION: Where to begin.... When we first started going here, they seemed pretty good. Good location with lots of staff who did their jobs, decent food, and not much competition.  In the last couple years, we noticed the service and quality have dropped significantly. Sometimes there are lots of staff, but when there are, it seems they group together and talk...mostly about how dissatisfied they are working there. Other times there are few staff, and they still talk...mostly about how dissatisfied they are there. Of course, there have always been good, hard working employees also.  A while back, we were helped by a relatively new employee there (Jake). We got to talking to him, and he explained that he came here from another BJ's location to help the manager create a better environment for the customers and employees--they ARE related. It was a great conversation that made us feel better about coming back.  The last two times we have come here, we were somewhat enthusiastic about having Jake for a server. Each time, however, he just didn't seem to care anymore. Most recently, we heard him complaining about staff. We noticed that not a single other employee came behind the bar to assist him with anything. Apparently, in turn, Jake demonstrated his unhappiness, anger, or frustration by providing us with very short and rude service....oh and the food sucked. We left the customary tip, but I do not know why... As we were leaving, we stopped outside the door to get our stuff together. There. we overheard two employees (who were on a smoke break) complaining about working there.  It is sad to see a place, that should be great (based on location, menu, and apparent backing) devolve to this level where nobody wants to be there. I can only guess that Jake tried to make the place better, but instead became a victim. Then ruined our experience.  Sad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=240

Usually I get A-1 treatment :( Hubby and I ordered appetizers. ..but it came with our meal. We sat there starving waiting. Finally my spaghetti lunch combo came but the pasta was cold. The meat sauce was just a scoop or two. All bad. Im sorry but I need a little more sauce with my meal. I asked for grated cheese that came 10 min after the meal was served. Manager asked how my meal was because I had asked for extra sauce...I told her what happened. She credited me my meal. I was scared to ask for anything else in case something would happen to my meal. I was good at that point. Luckily, I had a soup and my drink. But my drink was wrong as well!  At that point the waiter was not trying to wait on us and gave us the bill. Too bad. So many ways he could be corrected all this by just taking it in stride. Every thing is a learning opportunity! But from the looks of it....this guy aint gonna last too long. Just not his forte to deal with people and  cleaning up his mistakes. I'm not counting BJs out! One bad apple didn't spoil it all for me.

She came over after my sis & I had been abandoned for +15 solid minutes right when being seated. She got our orders started before she was off, but that was the only decent part. Joycelynn(sp?) could have cared less about picking up where Iris left off....abrasively bringing our less-than-stellar drinks, presumptuously trying to take our not-empty plates & rudely trying to take our money before we were ready. We've been in retail & it's a slave factory with low pay, but you DOOOOON'T, DON'T DON'T not give at the very least minimal pleasantries!!! That earned her a tip and not in dollar signs. To re-iterate: We were seated. My sister went to the bathroom for 5 minutes, came back and we sat for another 10 or more watching the tumbleweeds blow by until Iris-whom deserves a raise/promotion-sympathetically came over and at least got our orders going. BLESS YOU, GIRL!! THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS NEEDS MORE EMPATHIC EMPLOYEES LIKE YOURSELF. Joycelynn....yeeeeaaaah. =__= P.S. This has nothing to do with race, but quality customer service.

Martha S.,"Alameda, CA",60,28,81,2.0,7/28/2015,"After months of hearing my friends and family rave about BJ's, I finally had an occasion to visit the restaurant. There was a reservation for 8:00 pm Saturday July 25, arrived at 7:20 pm because I thought the reservation was for 7:30 pm. 8:05 the party sitting at our tables have yet to leave. 8:20 we are finally get our tables. By this time I am starving because I had not eaten in hours due to meetings and a gradation. I order the BJ's Classic Rib Eye Steak and asked it to be cooked to medium rare. When I finally received my food I was extremely disappointed. The rib eye was a horrible cut of meat,  more than 30% of the steak was gristle and fat. It was nearly impossible to cut a piece that didn't have fat on it. I did not send it back because I did not wish to wait 40 minutes for another steak. I ate 1/2 at the restaurant and took the rest home as it was too much of a hassle to finish there. I did order a peanut cookie pizookie and it was delicious.  I would like to add that our server, a slender woman with red hair (can't be 100 percent sure as the restaurant was so dark) was very nice.

Janice T.,"Hercules, CA",224,589,2832,3.0,3/3/2013,"I've been meaning to return to this place ever since I tried their Pizookie.  However, my husband is not much of a fan of these types of establishments.  He only relented because we had out-of-state friends we wanted to take out for appetizers and dessert at 9pm on a Sunday evening, and this was the only decent place we know that was open late.     AMBIANCE:  I see it as a typical American chain with spacious dining area and extensive menu at moderate prices.   SERVICE:  I am docking a star because service was super slow.  Granted that we were seated right away and our server was super friendly, the food took forever to come out from the kitchen.  To think, the place was not packed as it was already 9pm.  We just ordered drinks, an appetizer sampler, and a dessert sampler for crying out loud.  We were almost finished with our drinks when the appetizer arrived.  To make things worse, after encouraging us to try the different pizookie flavors, our server forgot to put the order in.  So we waited a long time for...nothing. Major disappointment!  We had to wait another half hour for dessert.  Bummer!    DRINKS: Piranha Pint -- $5.25 Pale ale Lightswitch Lager Pint -- $5.25  Malt flavored light beer Strawberry Margarita -- $9.50  Made of Ketel One Vodka and strawberries. Strawberry Splash -- $9.25  Made of Grey Goose Vodka, Disaronno Amaretto, Piña Colada and Strawberry Puree.  I am not into alcoholic drinks, but I was able to appreciate this cocktail.   FOOD: Best Beginnings -- $16.95  Consisted of Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  Excellent for sharing.  However, if it were just me and my husband, we would have shied away from the sampler and just picked the avocado spring roll. Pizookie Trio -- $9.50  We ordered the red velvet, chocolate chunk, and white chocolate macadamia.  The white chocolate macadamia was the best of the three.  It was as good as I remembered it.  The other two flavors were disappointing.  They were too sweet for my taste.   We should have just gone white chocolate macadamia all the way.    BILL:  Our total bill without tax was $60.71.  That's not bad for a party of four. We could have saved 50% if we didn't order drinks.  Word to the wise, go during happy hour if you want to save on drinks...duh!   :)  VERDICT:  Be prepared to wait forever for your food to arrive.  However, if you have lots of time to kill, then you'll feel right at home here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=240

Run C.,"Corona, CA",4,13,9,3.0,4/1/2015,"BJs is like a white frat boy who just recently graduate a prestigious Ivy League without learning anything useful so he rides his father's coat tails to a cushy wall street job. He tries his best to up his game and exude quality in his work. However, his attempts usually fall short, disingenuous, and tries to salvage the attempt by putting a humorous spin on his shortcomings. I'm rather confused as to what kind of restaurant this is. Is it a place for dinner? No, its too casual. Is it a place for lunch? Sure, if two hour lunches are part of your company policy. Just like the unfortunate millennial generation, it's surviving on handouts from their middle class parents.  If you've been to on BJ, you've been to them all. Almost everything down to the servers are the same at every BJ. I'm not convinced that they're an equal opportunity employer.  Ok, down to business. I use to think the food is less than acceptable. However today, I thought the food was good. I ordered a rib eye steak, medium rare with soup and mash potatoes. I enjoyed the meal. It's worth another visit if I get another coupon. I recommend ordering your meal ahead of time if you don't want to wait a long time for your food.  +1 star: Order was correct, and the food was tasty.  +1 star: Service was fine. The waiter came by a few times to check on us and remembered all our requests.  +1 star: Online ordering option for take out and dinning in.  Lastly, I don't get the Pazooki. It's just a large chocolate chip cookie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. People treat this as the best invention since sliced bread. I've had ample opportunity to try it in the past and on all occasions I've been puzzled by the attraction people have to this strange desert. It's almost pure profit for the restaurant. That's why they always push this dish. I'd rather save the money and get a nicer entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=280

It never happened. EVERY screen in there had basketball on it. By the time the bill came, we were not asked if we would like to order dessert and we were waiting to pay and get out of there.

Laney M.,"Alameda, CA",1,10,1,4.0,7/31/2017,"Went here on a date last night.   It was a Sunday night, the wait for the two of us was approximately 13 minutes.  It was bustling with activity, but still comfortable and fun.  Lots of groups, families, and couples on dates, and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Our waitress was adorable, fast, and attentive, and laughed when we prodded her with our silly jokes, so she definitely had a good sense of humor.   We started off with the basic appetizer sampler platter.  After trying all of the options offered, I will definitely be getting either the Avocado Egg Rolls (fantastic dip), or the Spinach & Artichoke Dip w Tortilla Chips next time.  Mozzerella sticks were good enough to get an honorable appetizer mention.  The boneless wings were fairly bland, and not very original (kind of reminded me of the grocery store microwavable variety), so I don't recommend those.    As for my date, he ordered the Chicken Fried Steak Burger.  His side choice was fries, and they give you a variety of options in the preparation - everything from an egg, to cheese, bacon, or even avocado / tomato.  I had a couple bites and thought it was fantastic, but he only made it halfway through the burger before filling up.  It really is A LOT of food, especially if you order the sampler first.     For myself, I ordered the House Top Sirloin, with sides of mashed potatoes, and the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad.  Really cool artistic presentation of Fresh mozzarella and tomato wedges, came on a separate plate.  The side salad could have very easily been its own meal if I had ordered it as a lunch by itself, very tasty because it was covered in basil, red onion, and Parmesan cheese drizzled with balsamic glaze that I wish I could get a bottle of at home to put on everything!    I ordered my Steak medium-rare, and they did it a little closer to medium, but it was still delicious and well seasoned enough that I did not need to order any sauces.    We had planned to get dessert, but we only made it halfway through our meals before we were full past our limits.  We got most of our food boxed up to take home, so there was definitely no room for that dessert!  I think this is a fantastic place to take a date, but if you have a large family and want to get stuffed to the gills with comfort food, this is probably the perfect place for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=60

Amy S.,"Concord, CA",881,1790,13528,4.0,2/10/2017,"I used to enjoy going to BJ's in Southern CA with my sister when we were in college. I stop in at this Concord location from time to time but it's not nearly the same trying to eat the Pizookie (cookie) dessert without her. However, I had dinner here with my boyfriend last night. We started with crispy portobello mushroom strips. For dinner, I ordered a soup/salad (chicken tortilla/wedge) combo and he had jambalaya. He also ordered a wedge salad to start. I asked that our salads be brought out together, thinking perhaps mine would be served with my soup, as an entree.  The appetizer came out and was delicious. Our server did an excellent job of keeping our drinks full and checking in on us. When we were almost done with the appetizer, my bf's jambalaya was brought out. No food for me, and no salads.  We told the girl who brought his plate out not to worry about his salad at that point, since he already had his entree.  However, a few minutes later my soup and salad, and his salad, were all brought out together. Even though we asked her not to bring his wedge, it remained on the bill at the end of the night. Kind of weird to serve a customer's salad after their entree and then still charge them for it after they say they don't want it anymore.  We had other things to do though and really did enjoy our server's good service, so instead of complaining and wasting time, we just left. Honestly, it's funny but the only part of our meals I didn't really enjoy was the salad. The chicken tortilla soup was excellent, and jambalaya very good too, but the salads were absolutely drenched in dressing and mine had almost no tomatoes on it while his was covered in chopped tomatoes. A little more consistency and a little less dressing would be nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=60

I am like Benjamin Blue of Forrest Gump fame except I go on and on about beer rather than shrimp. I was happy to see they had a tap of Pilsner Urquell. I ordered a pitcher, but when it came 35 minutes later it was a pitcher of IPA. Not a bad IPA but not what I was looking forward to. I told the waitress a mistake had been made. Twenty minutes later she brought me another pitcher of the same IPA. I told her the wrong keg must be connected to the Pilsner Urquell tap and settled down to drink a pitcher of IPA. A second waitress/assistant manager came by and asked me about it. I told her the kegs were likely crossed and she said she would check on it. Thirty minutes we flagged the second waitress down to ask about the kegs. She reports the bartender reported to her that the kegs were connected correctly. Here I sit with the aftertaste of American hops on my tongue and the feeling of grief that a perfectly good second pitcher of IPA or possibly a strong Pale Ale had to be poured down the drain.

Went to this one tonight, the margarita was WEAK and overly sweet, the potato skins were chalky & gross, they literally disintegrated into a pile if powder when you cut into them. Waiter left us for long periods of time. Asked other waitstaff for help, they said they were ""looking for him too"". Nice. Screwed up both of our orders...(2 cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad), and they both came out wrong (and brought out by a different waiter). Pretty simple...asked for one plain, and one with onion strings.  The plain one showed up with all toppings, and they put the onions for the other one on top of the caesar salad instead of the burger (WTF?!) Had to send back.  Then we had some other guy come over, I assume the manager but he didn't introduce himself, asking us what was wrong with the order. We told him, he was apologetic, but then just walked away without comment. Then we were left again another 15 minutes. Empty drinks & dirty appetizer plates just sat on the table. Flagged down yet another waitress, asked to order 2 more drinks, she said she'd order for us.  Original waiter came by, with attitude asked what was wrong with our order, then just walked away.  Another 15 minutes, no drinks. Yet ANOTHER waitress finally brought our corrected food. We asked to cancel the drink order & get boxes to take out food home. Funny, she said the 2nd drink order was NEVER PLACED.  Then original waiter returned & left the check. I noticed they refunded the price of one meal they messed up, but nobody told us they were doing that.  No tip. And we'll never go back.

Shane C.,"San Ramon, CA",65,175,38,4.0,1/9/2016,I had tried another BJs and was very dissapointed so I had avoided going to another one for fear of the same bad experience. It was Christmas eve and my wife had heard the pizza here was great so we decided to give it a try.  We sat at the bar and found out it was happy hour.  Great drink prices and discounts on the small deep dish pizzas.  We both ordered our own and they were lights out good.  I had pinapple jalapeño and pepperoni and I polished it off.  This is a happy hour we will revisit.  The lesson here is do not judge an entire chain by one bad restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=300
Terri N.,"Concord, CA",532,725,2908,4.0,3/20/2013,"BJ's has been open at Sun Valley Mall for a few years now, and I swear they have been packed ever since.  Definitely the most popular restaurant at this mall - if you're dining at peak times, be prepared to wait!   But every bite will be well worth it.  BJs is a conundrum - a gigantic menu but I've only sampled a handful of items because what I've had is so darn good I can't wait to go back and order it again!  Nevertheless, some highlights: GRILLED CHICKEN CLUB - Delicious decadent sandwich, put over the top by being served on what sure do taste like garlic bread.  My first and still favorite!   AHI POKE - Presented as an app but I have made this my entrée plenty of times.  Always fresh and delicious! CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP - Epic and delicious, made super special by their unique presentation.  You receive a large soup bowl filled with the chicken, chips, cheese and other goodies, and the soup is poured by your server over all the goodies from a little kettle.  It really preserves the integrity of the chips and cheese, nothing arrives soggy.  I was very impressed.   BLACK & BLEU FLATBREAD - A really good portion of yummy steak and blue cheese in pizza form - brilliant!   PORTABELLO/BALSAMIC DEEP DISH PIZZA- Doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore which is a shame, because this was EPIC.  Sitting at the bar with a glass of good wine, chatting with good company and munching on this pizza -  life doesn't get much better.  BRING IT BACK!!   ENLIGHTENED HAWAIIAN MAHI-MAHI - So tasty!  While you definitely know you're eating a healthy dish compared with all the French fries and cheese that will be all around you, there is no shortage of yum on this plate of food.  I loved it! BBQ BISON BURGER (from the Enlightened menu) - Wonderful!  Delicious perfectly seasoned and well cooked burger patty, topped with pico de gallo, roasted pepper, with a side of slaw.  Tastier than their regular burgers, seriously! And of course, Pizookies!  The original, gluten-free and triple chocolate are all SO good, super indulgent and enough for I'd say 4 people to have a good couple bites.  Seriously one of the best dessert options in any restaurant I could name in the area.  So thank you BJ's for great meals, and more to come! PS - There is an excellent photo op in the parking lot, signs for their curbside takeout that read ""Parking for BJs only"".  Yep I went there.  ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=300

We ordered beer, the stuffed mushrooms (which were decent and the only reason this gets 2 stars!), a deep dish pizza (TINY!!! tasted ok I guess...but it's really small!) and scallops dish (which I sent back immediately) and replaced that with the bison burger.  Whatever the scallops were drenched in smelled really bad. The asparagus was cooked all wrong so you couldn't really eat it.  Bison burger - I came out smelling like nothing but onions. Too much onions. They should've grilled the onions at least, it would've tasted SO much better. I felt like I just wanted to go back there and tell them how to cook it.

I only come to BJ's whenever my friends have a last minute plan to come together to get some drinks and eats. Although their entrees are average and seemingly generic to me, I think their forté is their appetizer selection. I really like their artichoke and spinach dip, and their fried calamari is really crispy and good. They have a good selection of drinks, but that's to be expected from a restaurant that specializes in homemade brews. My current favorite is the Gulden Draak Ale. As for the quality of service, expect some delays. Not sure what the reason is, but I always end up waiting a long time for my food. During the later hours, you go in and seat yourself, and it costs an arm or a leg to get the attention of a server.

I actually had little interest in going here.  On the outside, it seems like a bar-and-nightclub experience, not a place to take little ones.  Then Big Joe, a friend of mine from house church who's also a Yelper, told me ""Nah, nothing bad about it.  I take my kids there a lot.""  When my daughter won a coupon for BJ's at her school, there was our reason to go. Well, Big Joe was right.  It's more of a restaurant.  Sorta loud, like a place were you go hang out with the boys after work, or a girls night out with margaritas.  Not bad for kids, and they have a kids menu.  Similar to what I've heard about Hooters, this atmosphere is better than it looks. It looks like the bar takes up the entire long side of the wall;  I could be wrong on that.  But the drinks are stacked in shelves all the way to near the top of the high ceiling.  And the first five pages of the menu are their drinks.  Yep, they take their beer seriously, not too good for a non-alky like me. Food looks kinda uppercrusty, with prices to match.  Both my wife and I had chicken-fried steak, came with lots of vegetables;  I wasn't impressed.  We had to wait a long time to be seated, so I guess people come here for some reason other than the food.  Then the bill came - and the dollars-off coupon wasn't included!

It was cold and not crunchy at all which really disappointed me bc I love calamari so much. Another thing was their water!!

Naomi S.,"Pittsburg, CA",6,37,19,3.0,6/8/2015,"Like everyone in the area, I've been to BJs numerous times because I like their food and ambiance. Because of this, I decided to throw my fiancé a surprise birthday on Sunday, June 7 since their outdoor patio would accommodate our 40+ headcount. Let's get to it: Positives: -Manager Michael Gatto took the time to speak with me over the phone and go over my selected family-style menu for the day. He even offered to provide our 7 kids complimentary cheese pizzas! So nice! -Tables were set up and ready for our guests before our 1:30PM reservation time so no one had to wait to be seated! -Michael Gatto came out to the patio to introduce himself to me since we had spoke and emailed over the phone. He asked how everything was going and wanted to greet my fiancé. I thought that was great customer service and I appreciated that he wanted to meet his guests! -Our servers Ceci and Dijonae carried themselves well. They didn't look stressed out handling such a large party and they always had a friendly smile on their face. I enjoyed talking to them very much! Negatives -The planning phase was terrible due to lack of communication. I emailed BJs on two separate occasions regarding their menu but did not receive a response. I also called BJs on two other occasions and left my name and number but received no call back. It wasn't until my third email that Michael Gatto got back to me (I should note that Michael was not the initial manager who helped me. Alyssa Alvarado was the dining manager who helped me book my reservation and sent me an email with the menu. I never heard back from Alyssa after I tried to contact via email and phone). -The entrees I ordered were suppose to be prepared on four different plates so that they could be placed on four separate tables to be shared family style. Instead, the entrees were prepared on one or two plates which required my guests to stand up and pass the plate to another table. Very inconvenient on a hot June day outside where space was limited. After the first few times this happened it was later corrected for subsequent entrees. -Since I had sent Michael Gatto the exact entree and quantity of each dish I wanted via email, and since he confirmed everything, I didn't expect there to be any hiccups with my receipt so I signed and left. I was wrong. When I got home I reviewed the receipt and noticed that I was actually charged for the cheese pizzas that were suppose to be complimentary. I also noticed that the quantities of each dish I ordered were incorrect (they were less). It was such a busy day that I'm not even sure if my guests just didn't receive all the food I had ordered, or if I received a discount. I doubt it's the latter because I saw nothing complimentary on my receipt.  Although Michael Gatto was helpful, and our servers Ceci and Dijionae were great, my overall experience with planning a large party at BJs is three stars. There were just too many problems during the planning phase and the day-of the celebration for me to overlook.

Chris B.,"Antioch, CA",0,34,,4.0,9/14/2014,"It was a Friday night.  We went there with a party of 4.  We called in 30 minutes before to get our name in.  When we got there, we had to wait an additional 5 minutes, but then we were seated.  Waiter had us sit at a table as he told us there were no more booths available.  No big deal.  We ordered our drinks, and then a short while later ordered our food.  It did take them a while to bring everything out but it wasn't too bad.  I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger, well-done, along with the crispy fries.  I have to say, this burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my whole life.  I ordered it well-done, and if you like well-done burgers, then you know that it has a special flavor to it when it's cooked correctly.  Well they absolutely nailed it.  The bacon was top-notch and the bun complimented the burger very well.  I've had burgers from places like paddock café where I also felt they were VERY good, but this was truly a gourmet burger, on another level both in terms of quality, as well as price ;)  The crispy fries were also extremely good, making it pretty much a prefect dinner.  They have a great selection of beer to choose from also, and I enjoyed being able to try a new beer. Only real downer is that the waiter was not very attentive to us.  It seemed like the only time we could get his attention was by basically flagging him down.  Everyone felt pressured to order a new drink during the few rare times the waiter came by, whether they were finished with their current drink or not, simply because you couldn't count on the waiter actually coming around to give you another chance anytime soon.  The table we were sitting in was sort of in the middle of everything, which is the only reason we were able to flag down the waiter on occasion.  If we had been on the edge or something, we would have been screwed, maybe seeing the waiter once every half hour or less.  Even though this place is not particularly cheap, their service certainly is!  For me though, the food is the most important aspect, and I really enjoyed my meal this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=380

Well a couple hours later I started to feel a bit groggy and my stomach was feeling a little uneasy. I figured it could have been from the beer, or maybe I just overate, so I ignored it. A few hours later I felt a sudden sharp pain in my lower abdomen, and began cramping severely, after which I experience acute, bloody, diarrhea. I ended up spending the rest of my night/morning vomiting, cramping, and craping blood. Needless to say, it was food poisoning, most likely from the chicken on my pizza not being cook throughly. I was sick, and in bed the following day, and am still cramping.  My bf was telling his coworkers about the incident and ironically 2 out of the 8 present said they had experienced the same thing after eating at this Bj's.

Unfortunately when our food came...much later..our experience took another nosedive. His sliders were tiny and dry. My carnitas fries were almost inedible. The carnitas meat was fried and then must have been baked to the point where the meat was just a rock on top of the fries.

Adri A.,"Hercules, CA",358,53,88,1.0,8/14/2013,"NOPE. I used to think that this place was all right. Y'know, your typical 'eh, I'm not expecting much' chain restaurant. Now it's like 'oh man what is this?' My boyfriend and I haven't been here for about a year, so we figured we were due for a cheeseburger deep dish pizza (our fave) and a pitcher of beer. It seemed like a good idea while watching a game of baseball, but... The cheeseburger deep dish pizza we loved... what happened to you? It's no longer served in the buttered deep dish we knew to recognize; it now just arrives on an extremely hot plate. The dough isn't buttery at all like before and the toppings were very skimpy. It seemed more like a regular pizza but with bloated dough--a more half-assed version of its former self. The kicker is that it isn't the worst part about the pizza. The worst part was my boyfriend biting into a small piece of plate in his slice. Yep. Apparently a piece of broken plate had gotten into the pizza somehow. It was small--about the size of a dime, but still very alarming. He could have damaged a tooth! I regret not taking a picture of it before letting the waitress take it to show the manager. Apparently it was hidden under the cheese and other ingredients which is why my bf didn't notice it before it was too late. We pretty much lost our appetite after our unfortunate discovery... The staff, at least, was very understanding toward the situation. The waitress apologized, took our pizza away and set up a replacement (which we didn't even ask for, but oh well). The manager was apologetic and told us that she ordered the kitchen staff to do a clean sweep of the kitchen, which was assuring. My boyfriend received a form to fill out about what happened and her business card in case he needed to contact her.  In the end, we weren't charged for the pizza and its replacement (we ended up taking it to-go and carefully eating it at home). I thought the staff did a good job of taking care of the matter, but honestly we will not be coming back because our impression of this place is pretty much ruined.

Delivery driver was really sweet, but that's where any positive feedback ENDS!  We ordered southwest eggrolls, a santa fe chicken salad and a pizza. The eggrolls were edible but both the salad and pizza were absolutely not. They were the SALTIEST food items I have ever attempted to eat. The chicken in the salad (a seemingly somewhat healthy option) tasted like it had been soaking in ocean water then cooked in a salt bath and then dredged in salt. It was absolutely terrible. The pizza, aside from being horribly salty, was also undercooked and just gross. All this, horrible food, set us back $53 including a $7 delivery charge.  After eating a few bites of this disaster of a delivery dinner, I reached out to Grub Hub for help (their online chat tool is really handy, fyi) -- They submitted the complaint with the intermediary between Grub Hub and BJs, and on Monday my request for a refund was denied.

Jennie C.,"Hercules, CA",16,155,162,2.0,8/6/2013,"I arrived at BJ's a little before 5 pm expecting the place to have plenty of seating and attentive service. Instead my party was met with a fairly busy restaurant (so much for an early and quick dinner) and really inattentive service. It took quite a long time for our order to be taken and then half way through our meal the server went home for the night. The server that took her place seemed overwhelmed by the amount of tables she had to attend to.  We ordered salads and entrees and asked if we should order our pizookies for dessert when we placed our order. The initial waitress said we didn't need to order a dessert ahead of time, so we didn't feel too worried. I ordered a wedge salad and a gluten free pizza.  Our server didn't bring our salads. The person who brought our salads placed each salad in front of the wrong person.  The lettuce was crisp, but the tomatoes weren't ripe. The entrees took a long time to arrive and when they did, the same thing happened with the salad...all placed in front of the wrong person...and to top it off they didn't bother to take away our dirty salad plates.  We sat there for some time before we finally tracked down our server to place our dessert order (after considering going somewhere else for dessert because of the slow service). I ordered a gluten free pizookie. The dirty salad dishes finally disappeared but our dirty entree dishes remained (why?!?).  The pizookies arrived and my table mates was so undercooked the manager removed it from the bill (thank you).  With that said, we were there for TWO hours. Two hours?!? Why?!? service was sooooo slow. We should have just ordered our pizookies at the beginning - not sure that would have helped, however.  I should also mention that we came in for a girls night out to celebrate three birthday's. I told the original server when we placed our order and even told the second/replacement server when she took our pizookie order. None of us received a candle or a howdy'do.  I mainly chose this restaurant because of the gluten free pizza and gluten free pizookie. I'd been to the Reno and Roseville locations and had a great experience at both. I even did curb side service at the Vacaville location and everything was perfect. Flawless service and great food was found at three other locations...why not this one?? I'm disappointed in the service we received at this location. Based on this, I am not sure if I would return. So disappointing. Two stars for the gluten free menu. 0 stars for service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=400

They seated us at a reserved party table so we had to move all our things. Then it was way to dark. I could barely see my menu. Even inside the bathroom was really dark! The waiter brought my date the wrong food. And they brought us our drinks with no ice. Who wants warm drinks?! The food proportions were bad. I ordered parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  I got three very small broccoli,  and a very small scoop of potatoes.  The food was very good!

Alexys E.,"Antioch, CA",80,334,325,4.0,3/10/2012,"BJ's is not just a one trick pony! Besides their pizza, their other main dishes are fabulous as well. 1. The first time I went, I went with family. We had pizza, and must I say it was GREAT tasting pizza.  2. The second time I went I had their porkchops. I was expecting a double cut...it was close to lollipop pork chops but they were delicious and the potatoes that came with it were to die for. It came with sweet apples and mustard...it all tasted wonderful together. A great dish. 3. Third time I went I had Parmesan crusted chicken breast with again their fab mashers...the broccoli was cooked to death though. The chicken came with this lemon and sun dried tomato butter.. It was so rich that I could barely finish it...but rich is a good thing. 4. By the way, their raspberry lemonade is amazing. And if you're going to BJ's, you MUST have a pizzookie for desert.

That was a little whack, but my group of girlfriends already agreed to meet here for a birthday dinner.  FOOD - Portabella mushroom pizza: I love the strong woodsy taste of the mushrooms, but everything else was a bit lacking. I wish I tasted the basalmic vinegar sauce a bit more. - Mediterranean pizza: This one actually packed a punch of flavor! Kalamata olives, peppers, feta cheese...my friend got this one and I nibbled on it a bit. Will order this next time. - Stuffed mushrooms: a very delicious appetizer full of mushroomy, cheesy, garlicky goodness DRINKS Okay the big plus of all BJs? They have a full bar! I loved the Very Berry margarita...it was almost like an alcoholic smoothie. My friend had the Pink Cadillac--I would highly recommend if you are into citrusy drinks. SERVICE Stars come off for this section...we were scooted into a booth and it took over 15 minutes for someone to ask us about drinks! Another 15 mins passed before we got them. And our appetizers were served first without any utensils. How did they expect us to eat stuffed mushrooms without a fork? Waiting for the check took a bit longer too, although we requested it to be split in 4. ATMOSPHERE I'm used to the roominess of the Brentwood location. The aisles in this Concord spot is very awkward and narrow. It's hard to navigate to the back of the restaurant for bathroom without asking other patrons to scoot in. Talk about a traffic jam when another customer or waiter walks towards you in the opposite direction.

We called in ahead to reserve a spot in line and when we got there, of course there many other parties there waiting to be seated as well. The hostess gave us an option of either sitting outside at the patio or waiting for about another 45 minutes for a table inside. We opted for the patio, considering that it was 8:30 already. While waiting to be seated at the patio, there was a nice server handing everyone drinks and small slices of pizza. I thought that that was very kind of them. So, we waited for about 10 minutes because there was some disorganization, but we were finally seated. Yes, its outside, but there were heaters. At some point they turned it off and my feet were freezing.  Our server Melissa was very sweet, kind, and friendly. She really made up for the chaos that was going about in the patio. There was a giant group of about 20 (with lots of kids), a group of disgruntled older folks, and a whole lot of waiters and waitresses scurrying around. I wouldn't call this the ideal romantic Valentine's atmosphere, but I guess that's just what it is! Food: Calamari: not very fresh- I've had better.

S. D.,"Columbus, OH",28,42,,1.0,11/13/2013,"This place managed to ruin my simple birthday dinner. Our sever was great and compassionate, the manager on the other hand was a bit inexperienced and uncaring.  Our appetizers were okay, nothing to write home about, but okay. Our wine was excellent.  Our steaks where bland and unseasoned, one arrived well done instead of medium and one arrived cooked okay. Now I remember about 6 months ago the steaks being delicious and tender with a garlic butter sauce, which apparently is what made it tasty and tender. Have you ever have a tough steak that was cooked medium, I didn't either until tonight.  Our baked potatoes where not baked, they might have been at one point but they where nuked warm after being chilled, because nuking a baked potato the sits in the fridge makes it that solid non-fluffy consistently that I received tonight. Even boiled potatoes are fluffier than what they tried to serve me. So we complained to the manager, one meal was deducted, granted I ate more of mine but a 10% discount or having made my  glass of wine free, on that plate would have been nice, because you not only ruined dinner but a birthday dinner. He did not try to apologize for the cooks, to me that says obviously he knows they are nuking cold things and does not care about the quality of the food, which also says inexperienced to me.  Then they try to make me happy with a birthday dessert, I do not want dessert after an awful meal, no, that does not make amends.  I will not be returning, not because of the server but because the food was awful and the manager barely cared. You've lost my business forever.

It's a tradition we have had for years. Today the food was mediocre. Good flavor (slightly above average). The portions were average. The time it took to get our starters was decent. And the entrees came maybe 8 minutes later.  The flaws of the night:  Our server didn't use any type of note pad to take our orders. I have had this before but had a better out come from it. There were 3 mistakes made to our orders. Usually I give the server the benefit of the doubt, but since the expos (food runners) had the order slips in hand I could see that it was a mistake in the order taking. I will go into further detail of our orders and mistakes later. The server was very sweet at first. Until  we asked him to split the check (which I had asked him to do when we were greeted), he looked at us seemingly annoyed and walked away. This was the point when we had decided not to tip.  Our orders are as follows: *Seat #1 (Me) Starter salad: Golden Beets Arugula Entree: Toasted Chicken Pesto Sandwich   -Sub cup of Broccoli Cheddar soup (no greens salad)   -Extra side of pesto *Seat #2  Starter: Mini bruschetta Main Course: Classic Baked Potato  -Add bacon, chz, & sour cream *Seat #3 Entree: Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos Errors::: No topping on potatoes (even tho it was an extra charge).

The salmon was over seasoned and the pulled pork with fries was not cold but not warm either. Both were okay. Dessert... that's an entirely different story altogether. We were all full from our meals but one of our party insisted on getting a pazookie party platter. Five of us on one pizza size pazookie? I didn't think we could do it.

After about 20-25 minutes, my boyfriend went to go check where we were on the list, and it turns out they didn't even have our name logged in. They took care of it right away of course, after a very insincere apology from the manager. We were seated at a freshly wiped table and the waitress we had was very nice. However, the service was very slow. It seemed as if this waitress had too many tables to wait for. We didn't get silverware until our appetizers came. I had to ask for sides of ranch, twice. The food took forever. The whole experience took about an hour and a half.  The only highlight of the evening was the food. Try their giant stuffed baked potato with chicken (with a side of ranch!).

Then we had a 15 minute wait for a greeting and menus. Get the point? getting the check took another 15 minutes, and by the way, they gave us the wrong one. My daughter said the last time she came with some buds, they screwed up the check....twice. Getting the check picked up - another 5+ minutes. The food was average, the pizza not like I remember. I will give 4*s to the Hopstorm IPA, and the apps. But service is a 1*. The crowd is pretty lame, call it diverse ghetto. Fat ladies of multiple ethnicity with tats galore.

A.B. S.,"GA, GA",0,104,,2.0,7/4/2014,"Stopped in to BJ's for the first time yesterday, after work.  My colleague said he wanted to watch ""The Game"" and this was the place to do it.  He also said to me, ""The food here isn't great, but I like the atmosphere.""  So there it was, at the start and plain as day.  Okay, I am game for (almost) anything, including lunch at a nationally-represented place. The HUGE, four-image TV was impressive, bit without sound, who cares?  Bar was packed, but we found two seats at the far end.  Bartender was busy, so much so that what should have been a 45-minute meal stretched into double that.  She was perky, friendly but all business.  I asked about special drinks and she convinced me to try a pear cider. Good, sweet and not too tart. Ordered two appetizers, as I prefer grazing and was not super hungry.  Chose the Crispy (read: Fried) Calamari, with two dipping sauces, and the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms I saw on the plate of the diner next to me, who raved about them.  My friend had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon.  Then the wait began.  The place was not super crowded, and yet it took almost 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  My friend's tomato soup was brought to him, but neither of my dishes were forthcoming until his salmon showed up. Finally, a runner brought the plates and by then, I was ready to dig in.  The calamari, a long-time favorite, was properly and lightly coated with a crispy, non-greasy batter and fried just barely past the well-done but still chewy stage.  The alleged Lemon Garlic Aioli was more Ranch-like, but still better than the flavorless ""Spicy"" Marinara, which, at the very least, needed salt.  These were not the large, sometimes-rubbery rings offered everywhere, but smaller circles along with nicely crunchy larger pieces as well. The mushrooms were another story altogether, and not a good one.  The first bite of the half 'shroom I bit into had good fungus flavor, and that was about it.  None of the promised flavors of a ""blend of fresh spinach, BJ's own spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, chopped mushrooms, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese"".  That is a whopping seven (7) items, all stuffed into one little cap.  But that ain't the end.  The almost final product is then, ""drizzled with lemon pesto sauce.""  Perhaps.  But the only real, pronounced flavor discernible was a vinegar-y tartness, tinged barely with citrus.  None of the Feta's saltiness, no earthy Spinach or Artichoke notes, not even, again, salt. In the end, the cost vs. value was hinged on the fact that I was full, but not sated.  It was a business lunch and next time, I take my business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=440

My husband's steak was fine, but the sides seemed teeny-weeny.  I swear, it seemed like he had six green beans and a mini scoop of potatoes.  Maybe to make the steak look bigger?  My entree, however, really ruined my night.  How can you go wrong with fish & chips?  Maybe when the fish is fried in the same vat of oil as the jalapeno poppers, thereby burning the mouth of someone who can't handle jalapenos.  Instant heartburn too.   By the time the server came back, my husband was nearly finished his steak.  He did offer to replace the entree.  Did I want to wait for another order of fish & chips to be made?  This late in the game, no.  I opted to switch out for a salad, which was incredibly disappointing... practically revolting... ice cold, obviously pre-made (who knows when?) and stored in the fridge, with chunks of ice-cold processed turkey that I would only expect to be on a salad I bought at a gas station.  I ended up taking a few bites only because I was starving.  Can't believe we ended up paying for it.  We just wanted to get out of there.  Can't see myself saying, ""hey, let's go to BJ's!"" ever again.  Bleughhh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=440

The bun was ridiculously huge, dry and cold. Mahi-mahi rice dish embarrassingly small. Waiter's attempt at a bartender's slide of a glass of water across our long, long booth ended up in disaster, toppling over, streaming ice cubes and water down the length of the table and a cascading down to the floor.  The waiter handed me four towels, asking me to clean it up. The California Club pizza app (flatbread with chicken, applewood bacon, tomato, and avocado) was good, but certainly not good enough to suffer through anything else here. Oh, and you'll have a good wait outside before any of the fun stuff begins.

The servers look like they were on drugs, I swear! The fast moving, the constant talking before I can even answer their first question, making sure they heard my requests even when my dinner date cut me off with a question. They were on point, other than the fact that they gave us this small little corner table that was an add-on and the seats & tables were like a foot shorter than the others. We asked to change tables and they were debating it with themselves. Another older couple sat on the same table after us and they just plain left. Plus they served us piping hot food and left us staring at it without utensils for, what seemed like, forever. Complete torture. FOOD Soup of the Day - Clam Chowder. Flavors were good, but it was incredibly salty. Unbearably salty. Inedibly salty! I was super hungry so I finished it with all of my oyster crackers. My dinner date agreed that it was way too salty and did not want anymore of it. Baby Back Ribs, full rack. SO DELISH! Perfectly cooked ribs. They were moist and finger lickin'! I was super full and I still ate a couple more ribs because reheating it wouldn't do it justice. My only complaint is that they didn't sauce it enough while cooking. A couple of ribs on the ends didn't even touch BBQ sauce. I'm not a big BBQ sauce fangirl, but at least a smidgen of it is needed on ribs! Potato Skin. Probably one of the better potato skins that I've had. It's cut into small segments (I hate them when they're way too big to eat) and pops right into your mouth! They look like they're fried because it was super crunchy and crispy.  Beer - Snakebite. Super cold, which makes it so much more delicious! Really clean flavors. Best thing was that it wasn't an overpriced beer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=460

I ordered the lunch salmon with rice & vegetables, but the plate was more like rice and vegetables sprinkled with salmon. Seriously, this was weak. (the server did bring out a side of tortilla soup though to make up for the lack of salmon).  3. The rice and vegetables were not that good. I have have better fried peppers and onions before.  4. The Arnold Palmer that I ordered was barely sweet. I was definitely disappointed with that. The Tea to lemonade ratio was off for sure.  The atmosphere is also loud, so you have to talk louder than usual to have a conversation with your company. Keep in mind, this is a high volume chain restaurant so they serve tons of people everyday. On that note, the food felt rushed and again, the service was slow too.

There seemed to be plenty of them, and they were pleasant enough but seemed ""inattentive"" or ""rushed"". We placed our initial drink and appetizer order. Our drinks arrived and we gave her our entree order. Our entrees arrived almost immediately after we started our brews and then they delivered the appetizers about 5 minutes later.  WOW, slow down everyone. It's ""HAPPY HOUR"" not ""SPEED DATING"" we're here for. What made us giggle even more was that none of the many staff members that approached us notice or said anything about our ""untouched"" appetizers.  We ate and took the appetizers home in containers for later (which I must admit were good), but ""ill timed"". Staff was pleasant, but just going through the motions to turn tables. Not the pace that ""Happy Hour"" bar floor should be ran at so this is more a floor manager issue.  Be nice to the staff...they deliver your brews and food. Will we return?

Michele W.,"Martinez, CA",4,32,2,2.0,6/28/2013,"Won't be returning to BJ's anytime soon... they kinda suck.  Only eaten here about 6 or 7 times in the several years they've been here- but the experience is usually about the same. I just finally asked myself, ""Why do you keep coming back?!""  I guess because it's a big enough place and noisy enough, that the kids like it... but it is just a tough place to bring kids- because of the LONG WAIT!  Always a long wait, for everything! We usually try to go in off peak times, so we dont wait more than 15 mins for a seat... so that's fine. But it takes forever to get a menu, place your order, even LONGER for the food to come, and forever to get your check and get out. Seriously people-- what is wrong with you guys?!  We went in (myself, a girlfriend and our kids-- 6 of us in total) and our food took about 30-40 mins to come out. And we didn't even order that crazy of stuff. Just some appetizers and 4 kids meals (which the kids meals were horrible!) All in all, just a bummer. The table next to us sat piled high with dirty dishes the entire time we were there (about 90 minutes!) and I saw tons of staff just standing around. The table behind us asked for silverware 2 or 3 times before they finally brought it-- all the while their food sitting there in front of them getting cold. Even when I asked, 'when is our food coming- the kids are getting restless'... our waitress said, ""should be soon- you know, they can go run around out on the patio"" and pointed to their outdoor dining area. Yeah- like I'm gonna let my kids go run around and bother the diners out there --even if there were only a few? Plus, my little one is LITTLE... I cant just send her off to run and play.  That wasn't the point-- the point was - what's taking so long to make a salad and reheat some gross mac n' cheese?! It really was gross, all clumped together and oily.  I'm done. While I feel the food is OK (pretty much just ok)... there are so many better places I'd rather support that care about the customer.  Bye BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=580

Went here around 3:30 for late pre-bday lunch on 11/3/13, we got seated right away since  it's not even busy. It's a party of seven, two are toddlers, we ordered appetizer which took 35 minutes, we got our soup and salad first before that.  The entree took 50 minutes to get to our table! Plates was hot but the food, side dishes and sauces are less than warm already and some are even cold to touch. My veggies are dry too since it's probably been in the food warmer too long and got dehydrated! Steak ordered was medium well and came out dry and warm not hot. We called the manager to complain about how long the food took before we got it and that it's luke warm and not acceptable. They convinced us to redo our order and will try to get it to us fresh. The steak came out more rare than medium well the next time around, we've been at this restaurant for two hours now and i convinced my brother not to complain anymore since it's been horrible already and we just want to leave!  The manager did give us complementary gift card to use for next time which will not happen since the food was terrible and not worth coming back for!

Since my favorite was no longer offered I went with what I felt was a safe choice and that was a french dip type sandwich. The sandwich was not very good.

Excuse me ~ no one is smoking marijuana.  David said he could smell it.  What!!!!! First of all, no one is smoking marijuana and what has that got to do with my complaint regarding the poor customer service given by BJ's???  He was insulting and unprofessional.  I demanded an apology, It took three demands before David apologized!  That was the last time I will patronize BJ's Concord!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=580

My friend and I come here practically every weekend after we get our mani/pedi done from My Nails and have to order the spinach & artichoke dip.  That is sooo yummy, especially when the nachos are hot.  Then we order the strawberry lemonade and some entree.  I have tried THAI SHRIMP LETTUCE WRAPS, MAC N CHEESE, SHRIMP SKEWERS, MEDITERRANEAN DEEP DISH PIZZA, TURKEY BURGER, GRILLED CHICKEN PASTA, CHARDONNAY SHRIMP PASTA, CHICKEN WINGS, GRILLED CHICKEN PESTO FLATBREAD, CALAMARI, CLAM CHOWDER, AND BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE.  Man, I didn't realize I've tried so many dishes already.  But I guess when you have been coming every weekend for the past 2-3 months, you're bound to try a lot on their menu.  Some of the dishes are on the salty side so if you're watching your sodium intake or on a diet, don't order the pizzas or pastas or read the back of the menu.  You won't order 3/4 of the menu.  So if I really like something, I just order it. When we go there, we usually go to the bar area so we don't have to wait.  The wait can get ridiculous especially at night.  Better to hit this place up after lunch.  The waiters/waitresses are great.  We always get this waiter who has a DJ voice or more like he's interviewing for an auctioneer or a voice-over. LOL.  He's hilarious.  Last weekend, I ordered an appetizer and a flatbread and they came at the same time.  I like my appetizers before the meal so that I can have take-home for dinner. LOL.  Anyway, I love the atmosphere and the pleasant vibes from the customers.  The food is the best in the Concord area for sure and when you're done, you can walk it off at the mall.  After all that, I WILL give it five stars after all!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=520

Gayle and I thought that BJ's was very good for what it is. The location used to be Houlihan's in the Sun Valley Mall.  And they've done a nice job with the interior.  It has a nice night club meets brew pub feel, and features nice woods, cool bar lighting, flat screen TVs, comfy booths and decent acoustics for good conversation.  The interior of this BJ's is also much classier than the one in Southern California that I had previously been. We were promptly seated and for this Tuesday night, the place was full but not overcrowded.  We both thought that the table service was friendly and accommodating, although the actual kitchen coordination was a bit slow. As for the food, my pulled pork sandwich was delicious and it went very well with the creamy stout that I ordered.  Gayle had less luck with her fish tacos.  The menu mentioned that they were lightly breaded, but I don't think she was expecting a fish stick wrapped up in a tortilla.  In hindsight, Gayle would have ordered the grilled shrimp. I will be back, as I like these sort of ""guy"" places.  Gayle is not so sure, except maybe to take one of her sons out for a meal.  We also left speculating what additional dining options might be possible in the former Left Bank space within Downtown Pleasant Hill. Postscript:   After we got home, Gayle mentioned that she wanted some chocolate.  My immediate response was ""After all that food?""  Apparently that was the wrong thing to say?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=520

We were able to get a table (it was still early) and had a great time. B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- Parking lot gets full because of the mall, BJ's and 24 hour fitness -- This is one of the ""smaller"" BJ's so it gets packed quick -- HUGE menu like cheesecake factory -- Specializes in beer and pizza but offers a lot more -- Lots of TV's to watch sports and a bar, of course -- Happy Hour is always a win here -- Not personally a fan of their deep dish or new hand toss thin crust -- Thin cut fries or wedge fries, no regular fries -- Service is hit or miss depending on your server -- Soup in their breadbowls are BOMB (most people don't even know about them) -- Calamari was very good, fresh & the tartar sauce was the best -- Most entree' portions are HUGE -- Save room for a pizookie for dessert! (I prefer the glutten-free) I would have to say that BJ's is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. I love pizza but rarely do I eat it here. Instead I'm eating their appetizers like calamari or chicken wings (they also do boneless - not bad either), their chili or tomato bisque in a their delicious bread bowl, or a burger. I actually prefer their calzones over their pizza, go figure! Last weekend, I could not pass up the offer to try their new hand tossed thin crust pizza. From the description and the photo it looked like a hand tossed pizza crust but when it came out it felt more like a crispy flat bread pizza. It also sucked that it wasn't cut very well so I had to hacksaw it with my dull butter knife. Despite the crust, the pizza toppings and flavors were all there. I ended up with the new chicken bacon ranch and subbed spinach for tomatoes. It was a decent pizza but I will not be ordering the hand tossed again. Before we had our entree's we tried their calamari. It was very good and fresh but I wanted to mention how great the tartar sauce was. It was the best tartar sauce I have ever ate. It was very fresh and refreshing. It completely balanced the fried calamari. We finished it in no time. I always find it hard to believe that some people have not heard of BJ's famous pizookie. It's a small circle pan with whatever choice of cookie you choose served hot with ice cream on top. I've started to prefer the glutten free option because it's a lot lighter but still has all the flavor as the original pizookie. Don't miss out on this awesome dessert! I wish I would have remembered our server's name. He was seriously the best server we have ever had. There were moment when we needed him but he had that ""spider"" sense and would show up when we needed him.

If you call ahead, get in line to get your buzzy thing, go to the bar, have a drink, then another, then get lit up by your buzzy thing and head to a table, you can count yourself lucky. PARTICULARLY if you kept your buzzy thing in your pants pocket. I went in knowing the wait, and I was fine with it. When seated, it took me some time to peruse the ginormous Cheesecake factory-like menu to make my selections. I really want to return to this place (after maybe running a marathon, because the calorie counter they include at the back of the menu nearly had me in tears) to try more of their appetizers and drinks. That's really what stood out.  Fried avacado eggrolls were great, made even MORE awesome by our fantastic (no really, super high energy, high level of service, attentive but hella busy perky blonde) server, who noted my aversion to cilantro, and had the dish made without it entirely.  The ""deep dish pizza"" was lame. I got the buffalo chicken pizza hoping to share it with myself for lunch the next day, and I only ate one piece, and it was just meh. Dry yet greasy. Bland and uninteresting. MEH. I didn't even bother eating the rest that I boxed and took home, it was that meh. I just suppose I've been spoiled by the Chicago style glory that is Zachary's. Points for ambiance, and impeccable service. Tipped hugely, because I remember vividly how shit it is to work a so-so location where you biggest tips rarely even out your walk-outs and stiffers.

The pot stickers were good though. 3 of us shared a dessert which was delicious. I've been to other upscale restaurants and experienced way better customer service though. I mean I understand it was busy and we were the biggest crowd , but you need to keep up. I mean we got our appetizer at the same time as the entree... isn't it suppose to be appetizer, then entree? Afterward, when we all started to leave , got our check put some money in an waited for change. I had to ask for my change. The waitress wrongly assumed the change was her tip. WOW!

Just saving time... : ) So for Starters my gf and I had there pomegranate martins (which I had been anxiously waiting to try)  my friend also agreed with me on my pre planned decision of the great white deep dish pizza, Which is creamy Alf redo sauce, white chicken, garlic, parmesian cheese and thick succulent tomatoes (we shared a small) which was more then enough. Martinis took a little while to arrive but worth the little wait -pretty in presentation and excellent in taste and might I add very nerve calming: )  So this was my first time trying a deep dish pizza and what a great first impression it had with the most flavorful personality ever! This pizza had it ALL!! Rich creamy Alf redo sauce, thick moist chunks of white chicken flavored with garlic topped with yummy parmesian cheese ohh!! And did I mention the thick chewy drenched in butter, soft to perfection thick crust (yes I know so bad) but out of this world good!! I literally could barely eat one piece wow!! So overall My one complaint is the service is a little slow and it took some time to get our dishes though our server was friendly.Other than that, food was up to par with flavor and the drinks were sweet and strong.They are a little pricey,but not too bad consdering what your get. I will certainly be back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=540

However, the extremely long wait time between being greeted, getting drinks/food, and getting the check, has always annoyed my party and I.

If I didnt used to work at Gordon Biersch where we served growlers to go, I might have bought it. When I pressed them on why, they basically turned to another customer and ignored me. Whatever. That should have tipped me off to what i was in for. I was there to get take out, and when I got my pizza home wasnt fully cooked. Awesome. Go to BJ's. It's a great chain.

Then I tried one of their deep dish pizzas.  I now fully endorse BJ'S and everything they stand for. They also have an Ahi Poke appetizer that makes me feel like less of a human being, for I will never know what it's like to be something so beautiful.

Angie V.,"Antioch, CA",284,14,4,2.0,1/17/2014,"To celebrate a birthday I joined my brother, sister and significant others for dinner here. This was my first time here. Here are my thoughts: Parking: Shared lot with a shopping mall made for a bit of driving in circles before a spot became available.  Host[ess]: I entered the restaurant by myself, there were no guests ahead of me. Still, I waited several moments for the 3 host/hostesses to come to a stopping point in their conversation to even notice me. Only one (the male) seemed concerned that I'd not only been waiting, but listening to their irrelevant conversation. I then had to ask not once, but three times where the bathrooms were as the first and second times I received (from two different hosts) a very vague ""just over there"" with a hand gesture pointing somewhere to the back? bar? off to the left?  Server: If I were reviewing the server alone, I would give him 4 stars. He was friendly, made eye contact, got our orders right without writing anything down, was quick-witted, seem to genuinely care and overall was quite a delight. (Alexander, you deserve some recognition!)  Unfortunately though, none of our dishes arrived timely. I do not fault our server for this as we had a different server bring each course. In my opinion, the appetizers were really the only course that should have arrived untimely, as 3 of us put in our appetizer order later than the first 2. This theme carried on throughout our meal though. Entrees came one, then two and two (party of 5). The birthday girl's dessert came immediately after dinner plates were cleared and then the rest of us were asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. The birthday girl's dessert was done before anyone came back to ask if we'd like to order dessert. We did, and we waited an incredibly long time for that too. There is nothing I hate more than sitting, waiting for the arrival of the rest of the party's food. Those who got theirs, feel uncomfortable knowing their food is getting cold. Those who are waiting feel uncomfortable as they wait hungry, salivating over the food that has arrived. Inevitably, someone insists they go ahead and start. They do, and the hungry continues to wait awkwardly, only to receive their dish just 3 bites before the first served finishes.  Food: Pretty good! The pasta was over cooked on one appetizer and the paired ""garlic bread"" was more like very large croutons - way over cooked. The mushroom appetizer had mushrooms of all sizes, mostly unusually large. Great for stuffing, sure, however I couldn't help but wonder where they came from (GMO, anyone?). My dinner, the balsamic chicken w/ mashed potatoes was just okay. The chicken was over cooked, but just barely. The mashed potatoes had good flavor but were very, very dry and not creamy. The balsamic drizzle was quite tasty, Small bites of balsamic, crispy onion garnish, baby greens salad and chicken made for a well rounded bite. The dessert, the berry pecan cobbler, lacked berries in a way that left me wondering if they warmed up a Costco blueberry muffin and served it with ice cream. If I wanted a dense, cake-like cookie, I would have order the pizookie. I wanted a fruit cobbler though, and that was definitely not what I got.  Miscellany: No one smiled, except for our server at a joke that was made in his presence.  The lighting was so dim that I could barely read the menu. Even more disturbing when I realized I could barely see my food once it finally arrived. My brother thought I'd ordered dessert for dinner as the balsamic looked like hot fudge and the mashed potatoes looked like ice cream. I couldn't tell if I had a berry cobbler or a chocolate chip pizookie.  So, would I go here again? No, especially not with any of my friends and certainly not with my chef husband! I'd be so embarrassed! Do I consider this place kid friendly? No. The menu did not reflect children being taken into consideration. If I were on a playdate of sorts, with kids, at the mall and we needed to get lunch, I would pick BJ's over the other mall options though. Their lunch specials look appealing enough and certainly won't break the budget. As a pregnant woman, the booth was bullshit - I barely had enough room to carefully slide my swollen belly under the table. BUT I did come in late, not with the group, so how could anyone seating our group know?  Who might like this place? Teenagers, young adults and anyone else who might not have experienced quality food or service, or those who are satisfied with mediocre. I could see a young person feeling ""grown up"" being in that environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=540
Niki H.,"Oakland, CA",13,30,2,5.0,12/10/2013,"Jeez, I don't know how this place can get less than four stars. The wait time is, meh, but it's worth it. I had my 21st birthday here two years ago and the person who waited on us was one of the best waiters i've ever had. That's not an exaggeration. Probably THE best i've ever had. He even created a drink for me and said I can name it! The bartender working at the time even came over and treated me to a shot and told me some ""breathing techniques"" to do while drinking them. All very very nice people. I remember my 21st very fondly and was very happy I decided to go there to celebrate it. I went again for the first time in a while (was out of the country for a couple of years) a few nights ago with my mom who is *very* nitpicky about restaurants. I was a little nervous she wouldn't like it... The waitress we had was adorable. She sat down at our booth (which was huge for only three people) and took our orders which I thought was cute. It showed she was comfortable with us which, in turn, made ordering fun. My mom ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop with a side salad and coffee... I, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. When mom's salad came she took a bite and instantly loved it (This is only the salad, folks. The salad.). ""Oh, this salad is DELICIOUS. Niki, here, you gotta try this salad. It's so crunchy and the sauce is wonderful! I need to make sauce like this. Here, try it! Just taste the salad!""  Yay, the salad gets an A+ from my mom.  Also, the coffee was the best coffee she's ever had at a restaurant. It had to have been freshly brewed because I tried it as well and it was ... so ... GOOD.  Coffee gets an A+ The main course arrived and, surprise, my mom was gushing over each bite. ""Oh. MMMM. This is so good. Try this. Let me get a piece of that chicken. OH. Yummy."" Main course A+ And how could we forget the Pizookie? My ten year-old sisters absolute favorite dessert on this planet. It's literally a huge, fresh-baked cookie topped with ice cream. My mind was blown when I realized it's a combination of the word ""pizza"" and ""cookie"". I'm slow, ok? We had the original (chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream) and devoured it all in under 5 minutes, probably.  Dessert gets an A+ BJ's gets an A+",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=540

I am ALWAYS overwhelmed by there menu and have learned to stick with the pizza which has ALWAYS been delicious.  We walk in on a Saturday night and the hostess is on her cell phone. She takes my name but doesn't write it down, and motions for me to stand away from the hostess station. She motions to another employee while she's still on her cell and another employee takes our name and seats us.  The staff is just ""ok"". They don't seem to genuinely enjoy there job which isn't really my problem. It just sucks when you want to go out and enjoy dinner and you don't feel welcome. Maybe it was just our waitress??? But wait... There was a point when 2 of the bus boys were arguing while clearing the table behind us and it lasted more than an awkward look between my dinner guests and I.

Emily J.,"Concord, CA",380,1293,166,4.0,11/8/2009,"I started with their basic beer sampler - blonde, pale ale, red and porter.  I have had their beer at other locations and already knew that it was good and the sampler definitely didn't disappoint.  They have an extensive menu.  Burger? Pizza? Salad? Sandwich?  Too many choices that all sound delicious. I highly recommend checking out their menu online before you visit. I ended up ordering the California Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  This sandwich consists of a thin grilled chicken breast served on toasted, cheesy, sourdough bread and topped with avocado, green chilies, pepperjack cheese and chipotle mayonnaise.  It was very tasty although the chicken was a bit too salty, at least for my taste buds. The fries are crispy and addictive. (Don't say I didn't warn you.)   As is required for all large chains, the nutritional information is made available.  This information is conveniently located in the back of the menu so you can make an educated, good (or bad) decision.    The service was friendly and there were plenty of staff readily available.

Considering the problems we have in this country with under cooked food I was surprised that this could happen twice in a row.

Kathryn M.,"Concord, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/7/2013,"Stopped in for an early dinner on a Friday night.  Once we got seated with menus, waitress finally came around, put her knee on the extra chair and took our order.  We had no silverware which she noticed.  She brought our water but no silverware.   I noticed there was a bug or something in my water so we asked for the manger.  We showed it to him and he took away the glasses. The waitress brought us new water but made no apologies. 10 minutes later came back and tossed 3 sets of silverware on the table.   When we got our order, we asked the runner for water as we were out and no one noticed. She never came back with water so we stopped someone else and asked her.  She was able to fill 2 of 3 glasses and we asked for a pitcher so we wouldn't have to keep trying to ask someone. She said she would be right back but again, never returned. French fries were cold on 2 of the dinners. Waitress never asked how our dinner was.  She did come over at one point with another server and leaned around one of us, stated 'oh they are fine' and left again. Once again out of water, we were able to find her and ask for water.  She brought enough for 1 1/2 refills even though there were 3 of us at the table.  When we brought it to her attention, she blew it off and said she would go get more and the pitcher wasn't filled all the way and that's why there wasn't enough. We asked to speak to the manager again.  We saw him talking to her but he never came to the table.  So we asked another server for the manager.  When he finally came over, she stated that she had not told him we wanted to talk to him! He knelt at the table and apologized and said he would talk to her about her service.  While he was talking to us, the waitress leaned over him, grabbed the ketchup off our table and walked away!

Danny T.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/12/2015,"3/12/2015 So I came to write this review based on the manager On duty Daniel . My family and I came to this bjs at 8:00 pm. We order our food at 8:15. Within 10 min out appetizer and beverages came out. In my head I was thinking we are going to get our food pretty quick. We finished our drinks and appetizer by 845 and enjoyed the game that was on tv. Around 915 I noticed our food wasn't out yet. Keep in mind it was not busy. At 930 our waiter (Amy) came to our table to explain to us the mishap that happened in the kitchen. She informed us that our food is on priority and will be out ASAP. In addition she informed us that the manager was going to come around to speak to us. Now I get it, nothing is every perfect and things happen. Our food came out 20min later and our waiter asked if the manager came around yet to ""speak to us"". I was not expecting a lot. I wasn't even expecting free food. The manager Daniel came around and asked us ""if there anything else you need or anything I can get for you"" we replied with ""no its ok"" and he went on and said ""if there is anything else you need just let the waiter know"". Now I've worked in retail for a long time and things happen but for the manager to show ZERO EMPATHY was beyond my imagination. A simple acknowledgment that our food came out later and a simply apology for that would have made it a semi better experience. You are the manager duty of a large establishment and I would have expected more. Once again on the record I understand things happen, but for you leader/manager on duty to that type of demeanor is unacceptable. His lack of empathy left me with negative remark of this BJs establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=600

Since it's always packed you would think staffing will be increased to produce quick turnover, but that doesnt fly normally with the BJ's family.

Jeannie E.,"East Bay, CA",2,5,,3.0,7/1/2013,"I frequent often and the service has home downhill. Visited last week BEFORE the lunch crowd and just after they opened. Waiters white shirt was a mess. I inquired and he said he made a big batch of tea and spilled. Funny, it didn't look like tea, but I believed him. His apron had white stuff all over too. I wouldn't have thought much more of it, but we were seated next to the window and 30 minutes later, I noticed another employee parked in the very first parking spot (aren't they supposed to leave the good spots for customers?), get out of her car. From a distance I noticed her shirt wasn't clean and as she walked past the window while tying her apron, I could see her apron was filthy. I can't believe management allows that. Things do get spilled in a food business and I assume there are extra shirts and clothing just in case. How can you allow an employee to start a shift looking filthy?  That is unacceptable. I'm still considering speaking with a manager, but I doubt it will make a difference. I had to wait so long to pay after asking, that I don't think they care anymore.  The food was good, but it still disappoints me with the changes they made in the soup/salad lunch special.

Toppings good and fresh. Beer good and when I couldn't make up my mind on which one to choice they brought me 2 samples to try. (nice touch). The management just needs to remind the young workers to make an extra effort to clear empty glasses and plates, make sure there are napkins & utensils on the table (or at least bring them after seating.

We ordered drinks, the girls cosmos, myself a mojito. My mojito was made well and it tasted good and the girls said their cosmos were good as well. The servers were nice and really helpful when we were figuring out what to order. We got the artichoke dip, avocado rolls, mini deep dish and a flatbread. All of the items were really tasty and very cheap, around $4, $5 or $6 depending on what you got which is a good deal. The drinks as well, so you could get mixed drinks, beer or wine and it's included in the happy hour prices which was nice. So I got one of their beers and it was pretty good while the girls got a lemon drop that they said was their favorite. For desert we each got a glass of wine and the 3 pizookie which is a cookie topped with ice cream and we got red velvet, chocolate and macadamia nut. All were amazing, I'm surprised I never had it before.

Daniel P.,"Beaverton, OR",13,84,58,5.0,10/29/2009,"Well I went twice this week and overall I had two great experiences. The first time I went for lunch, as I got to school right across the street and someone suggested popping over. The service was fine, it was in the middle of the day on a Tuesday so it was pretty slow, so there were a few servers attending to us.. I had never been to this chain before, but my friend had and suggested the pizza. I had the Cheeseburger pizza and he had the Great White, we both shared a little and I must say that they were both excellent!!! I got some of their house brewed root beer, it was pretty good but not amazing or anything. However considering it didn't really cost a lot and there were free refills I would recommend it for perhaps a long dinner. Their register computer was down so they gave us free ice cream without even a second thought and I really appreciated that.  The next night we had a final and I suggested to someone that we go over to BJ's and that I had had a good meal the previous day. Now THIS was a good test of how well BJ's performs under pressure. I got there first with a friend and we got a table for 4, this was right during dinner time and they were packed but we got a table after maybe 15 minutes. Soon after that we were joined by three other friends from our class that had heard we were coming....and then six other people.....and then eight other people!!! Almost our entire class of thirty showed up when they had no tables and in the middle of the dinner rush!! SOMEHOW the good people at BJ's found seats for everyone, while providing seats to the people waiting in line, AND continuing to serve us without interruption. WOW.!!! So on to the food, I tried the spring rolls and the calamari, and I enjoyed the classic Angus burger for my entree. The spring rolls were fine, but sort of small for the price. The calamari was soggy rather than crispy and yet was cooked completely properly and had wonderful flavor, and usually I hate soggy calamari. I have had a decent handful of gourmet style burgers, and this one was one of the best. The bun was hot and toasted, the meat was flavorful, and overall the burger was a good size. Also the potato wedges on the side were tasty and definitely plentiful, I even shared them with a friend (and I HATE sharing!).

On June 3rd, I came to BJs after my graduation around 12am and I sat in the second table on the middle right side in front of the restrooms. My waitress if I remember correctly was a white blonde (maybe platinum blonde) girl. I ordered 3 of the mini pazookies for my cousins and which costed around 10 dollars. Sure I apologize for not leaving a good tip BECAUSE I HAD NO MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT.  I had enough money to just be able to pay for the pazookies which is why I chose to purchase it only. My money has been going to college. I'm not a rich girl who won't notice any extra charges to her account. This waitress probably decided to add a extra 6 dollars to my account and thought I wouldn't notice. My account was overdrawn because of her and if I did not catch it I would have been charged a extra 25 dollars from my bank because of this desperate girl who thought it was okay to do what she did. This is not OKAY at all. Beware coming here because you'll get screwed over. STOP going here and go to Lucille's BBQ instead since it is right by it.

The booth itself had not been bused from the last customers, but we were advised that we should take it before someone else does.  I had to flag the manager down 10 minutes after sitting down to request that my table be bused.  The server arrived 5 minutes later to give us menus without taking our drink order.  When she returned she took our drink order and our food order and I proceeded to wait 30 min before getting my beer.  I actually got my food before either my roommate or myself got our bar drinks. The burger I ordered was cooked right but was bland and the sauces I had requested on the side did not come with the burger, I had to ask AGAIN to get them.  The water that I drank while waiting for my beer sat empty during the entire meal. On top of all of this, BJ's double charged my debit card.  I am really not a picky person when it comes to restaurants as long as the food is alright and the service isn't horrendous.  Our server spent more time flirting with the old guys at the table next to us than she did trying to make sure our experience was at all reasonable.

It was a wet wet day and we didnt want to take our litle one out anywhere far... with the options among us we chose to come here for the first time as we knew the selection of food we could choose from would be plentiful. Despite the rain, our service was excellent. We were seated promptly and given a chance to settle in with our little one.  Our server was very nice and recommded certain beers for my sig other while giving us a children menu and crayons for our little guy. We ordered a small BJ pizza and the meatloaf sandwich... not really knowing what to expect. He even gave us the mashed potatoes and applesauce for our little one on the house. What a great guy. I had a great time there. He was busy with other tables but made sure we were taken care of. Our food came out in good time, not the best, but I dont know how busy they really were as we were in a booth where you couldnt see much. I recommend this place if you have kids, its very family friendly . The prices are a bit steep for the appetizers... they cost the same as an entree so we nixed that step and went right to the food. The deep dish pizza, OMG, so good! It reminded me of Zachary's in Oakland's Rockridge area...since Zachs is a bit of a drive now, if we are feenin' for a lil Chicago style pizza, we may just zoom on thru to BJ's. The meatloaf was really good, needed some spicing up so I asked for Tabasco and the mashed potatoes could use a bit more butter and seeasoning as well but hey its not a 5 star place right? I would be back, probably for the pizza and to watch a game some time soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=500
Frank and Carol P.,"Martinez, CA",36,44,8,2.0,5/28/2012,"Underwhelmed. Came here for lunch today, ordered the deep dish Chicago style pizza. I wasn't served deep dish Chicago style pizza. I was served an inch and a half of sponge like bread dough with a thin layer of toppings with almost no red sauce. The pizza was dry. A Chicago style pizza should have a nice hand tossed pizza crust,  many layers of tasty toppings, cheese,a thick layer of red sauce, and another sprinkle of cheese. Chicago style pizza this was not. So, if you're by Sun Valley Mall and you're craving good pizza, drive down the street four blocks and go to Melo's Pizzeria. If you are craving really good pub/grill restaurant go to Jack's in Pleasant Hill. It's not a chain restaurant, the staff is happy to see you, and the food is so much better for the same price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=500

I wish I could remember her name BUT I will just say SHE CAN NOT COUNT OUR MONEY THAT WE PUT WITH BILL TO PAY with rest on card!!  Apparently, she didn't realize that she put the majority of our money out of the way when counting so my friend got over charged on his debit card. We told her and she corrected it. Couple days later, he realize they didn't reverse his charge on his card, talked to the manager and told him to file a claim/fraud with the bank to get his money back. WTF KIND OF SERVICE IS THAT?!!!

Our waitress took our order....she had help serving the food since we were a big party.  After that I never saw her again until one of my nieces had to get up herself and direct her to our table.  She never even came back to see if we needed anything else.  Somehow, we always have to wait at BJ's for additional items we might need for our meals.....never fails!   We ordered dessert cause we had to wait for our other party to finish their meal....our waitress took our order and you would think at that point she should've emptied our meal plates to prepare for our dessert.....but no she failed to do that as well.  Then she served our dessert and she still didn't take our meal plates away which at that point, I just pushed in the middle of the table.  It was an awful experience.   Our waitress thought she was gonna get a good tip from us....we were a party of 12 and to my husband's disappointment again at BJ's....he left her with no tip at all!  My husband is a good tipper....he'll even tip our donut place $10 for a dozen of donuts, but this time....she could've received a good size amount of tip especially for our large party.  TO OUR WAITRESS......you never know who you're gonna be serving......that's too bad!

Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,2.0,4/5/2010,"I would definitely like this place better if I were a beer drinker or was out with girlfriends and wanted to try one of their fruffy drinks, but alas, I was here with the family for lunch and it was pretty meh. The place is like a sports bar/pub/chain restaurant rolled into one. I think as they have expanded the chain and what I can assume the menu, there has been a lot lost on the food but probably made up for in the drinks (or maybe they depend on the drinks to numb the taste buds?). We were seated right away on a semi late lunch for a Saturday afternoon and our server pounced on our table immediately to take our drink order and ask if we wanted an appetizer. While I appreciated her enthusiasm, I was a bit put off at the rushing feeling I had with her approach.  I advised her it was our first time at the restaurant and it would take us a bit to figure out their large menu and she just shrugged and said ""oh, okay"". I think I am used to more savvy servers or something.  We perused through the extensive menu and husband ordered a mini pizza( he was the smartest of the bunch) as the rest of the offerings were a mix between Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumper rolled into one (but with smaller portion sizes). Daughter had shrimp tacos and I had a chicken club sandwich on sort of soggy bread that came with burnt bacon bits on the sandwich instead of nice strips of bacon. The fries that came with my sandwich were the best part of my meal, but the lack of service put me over the edge. I still don't get how servers can bring fries and not bring ketchup or even ask if any is needed?  The waitress did not come to check on us until the meal was more than half way eaten and asked if we would be wanting dessert. I inquired as to how the bacon was supposed to come on the sandwich and she said it came to me the wrong way and asked if I would like something else. I declined that as well as dessert and she brought us the bill -all charges intact. Had I been paying and not husband, her tip would not have been so generous...

The service was slow that day, and I think it's because we had a big party and many of us ordered pizzas. I can understand the pizzas taking longer to bake. I went there again with my fam of 3 and a friend on the night of July 4th. I was surpised that they were open so kudos for them. We ordered drinks since we were parched. The lemonade was a bit icky, even my 4 y/o said it tasted funny. We decided to order the 3 mini pizookies. OMG that took forever. We waited and waited and waited. How long does it take to bake 3 tiny cookies? It wasn't even busy when we first got there. The 2 guys sitting at a table next to us just got up and left because no one was taking there order. I don't blame them, they did wait while. We finally got our pizookies 40min later. Are you freakin serious?

Monica B.,"Clayton, CA",9,87,39,1.0,6/14/2014,"Ugh.... not good. What has happened to BJs? We came at an odd  time today for lunch (2:30) and were seated right away. Love when that happens, but it was all downhill from there. The runner brought our appetizer without plates. He ran off before we could ask him for some. Our calamari was mostly the tentacles - you know, the spinely part of the squid. Then our entrees came out. The pork chop was really dry and hard to cut. Thank goodness I asked for the sauce on the side because it was cold and sickeningly hot/spicy. I would not have been able to eat the pork chop if it was served with the sauce on it. It came with green beans and red potatoes which were very dry/over cooked. My son thought he ordered a large baked potato, but we found out when they brought out his tiny, overcooked potato that they don't make those anymore. He also ordered a side of broccoli which was in a tiny dish where the broccoli was covered with dried out carrots. There were a total of four tiny pieces of broccoli in the dish. The pizza was disappointing - I would say a tad bit better than microwave pizza. This was their normal crust - the deep dish pizza that some of the other diners had looked more promising. Service was poor. Our empty appetizer plate stayed on our table the whole time, server forgot to refill my husband's tea when she said she would be ""right back"". Server rarely came by and never removed any of our plates.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=500
Rose P.,"Elk Grove, CA",11,16,,2.0,5/4/2014,"Let me qualify this review by stating that I have worked as a hostess and a server before, and so I know how difficult and chaotic the job can be. That said, this place really needs to tighten its gears when it comes to service. Most disorganized place I have been to in quite a while.  A friend was visiting from Sac and we went here just this afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner. Neither of us know much about the restaurants in this area, but we've been to various BJ's before and find them to be fairly dependable  as far as food is concerned. We also know, from previous experience, that service can be pretty spotty depending the location and how busy it is, but this one took the cake.  When we walked in the door, the manager and a host were standing at the host stand and the manager had to tell the host to stop talking to another employee and take care of us first. He left, and rather than seating us in the dining area or letting us know that there was a short wait for tables (it wasn't packed, but they only seemed to be seating in one area of the dining room), she asks us instead to check out the bar area because it was open seating. This wasn't a giant deal (just a little jarring) so we checked out the bar area but found no booths available. We went back to the stand, and they were in the process of seating a group of 3 people in the dining area, so apparently there were free tables available. There were also plenty of tables open in the patio area, so I'm not really sure why the first thing they recommended was for us to seat ourselves at the bar.  In the end, because it was a nice day, we chose to sit outside. They have a pretty large patio area, and at the time, there were only three small tables occupied (two couples and a group of 3 girls), but we still had to wait for them to wipe a table down before we could sit. While they're wiping the table down, the host seating us said, ""oh, let me get some silverware""--this will come into play later--and goes to fetch them. We're seated, and a couple of minutes later, our server comes to take our drink orders (two coffees, a water, a diet). She brings the drinks to us but has to make a second trip for sugar and cream for the coffee. We order our entrees.  I can't say how long it took the food to make an appearance as we weren't in any particular hurry, but it did seem longer than our usual experience. My friend had a cheeseburger and fries. I ordered the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the gravy on the side. When they put the plate down in front of me, I didn't know what to think. It was probably the blandest presentation of fried chicken ever (and I love fried chicken). The two breast pieces were much smaller than I anticipated, more brown than gold, and were just lying on top of a mound of mashed potatoes--this was everything on the plate.  Luckily, they tasted better than they looked, but you eat first with your eyes, and it was not a sight that whet my appetite, to say the least. Furthermore, that silverware I mentioned earlier? They apparently never made it on to the table, so we had to flag another server down in order to get a fork for my mashed potatoes. We hadn't seen our server for a while, at this point, though she did reappear shortly after the other one went inside.  There were just a lot of little things like this that overall gave the impression that no one in this place has it together. In addition to the above, about ten minutes after we were seated and while we were waiting for our drinks to appear, another server came to our table to ask if we'd already been helped. On the one hand, it's nice that she thought to make sure, but on the other, shouldn't every server know which table belongs to who, rather than everyone having to follow up with all the customers to make sure no one is being ignored/forgotten about? Also, in the time that we were there, three different times, food runners came out asking each table if they happened to order the dish they were carrying--they had no idea what food was supposed to go to what table. (Keep in mind that there were only five tables there after another couple sat down, and three of them were already in the middle of their meal or finished.) To her credit, our server was friendly as was everyone else. It was just the general feeling of disorganization and chaos that really marred the experience. Hopefully they can fix these issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=500

Matt H.,"Concord, CA",18,10,2,2.0,10/22/2015,"I usually don't go to BJ's during my lunch break since it takes too long to get food, but I discovered their mobile app recently which I thought would make things very convenient to order in advance. Two days in a row now I've had problems (yesterday my burger arrived with no cheese, despite the request being very visible on the receipt), today they clearly didn't start making my food until I arrived to pick it up. They had sent me a confirmation email with the pick up time clearly stipulated, yet I spent half of my lunch break waiting for it to be brought out. My biggest problem in both cases was the lack of accountability for error, in both instances an employee gave me an excuse that was clearly meant to distance the restaurant from the problem, rather than accept responsibility. Yesterday it was ""oh well the order just didn't print correctly"" (they showed me the slip and it printed just fine), today ""your food isn't ready but it's being bagged up"" (took nearly 20 minutes to ""bag"" my food, clearly a lie). To BJ's: take responsibility for your errors and stop treating your customers like they're idiots.

The wait for a table was almost an hour, but I kept telling myself the food was worth the wait.  After we were seated, it was another 8 - 10 minutes before our server could get to us, but  when he did he was friendly and courteous.  We ordered calamari, the roasted veggie flatbread and chicken fried steak with green salads.  The calamari was done perfectly - the breading light and crisp, the meat tender and flavorful.  The aioli had a delightful garlicky bite that balanced the mild flavor of the fish beautifully.  The flatbread was very tasty, although the toppings were very uneven - an oversight that was easily rectified.  Then we were served our main course.  I love chicken fried steak, and eat it only on very rare occasions and dug in with gusto. The breading was beautiful, dark golden and crispy. I took a bite and paused tasting . . . . nothing. I added some salt and pepper - still nothing.  When our waiter came back, I explained the situation to him. He was immediately apologetic, offered us an alternative entree, and assured us that he would ask the manager to ""take care of it."" (And it was - far above and beyond what we expected)  Their house-brand sodas are very good, the cheddar mashed potatoes were delicious.  Aside from the chicken fried steak my only critique is the house salad which was straight out of a 1950's diner. Iceberg lettuce, cucumber, tomato, julienned carrots and croutons. BORING.

You'll be wasted before you know it.  -The service here has been phenomenal from the servers (not the hosts...they're terrible. Management should work on that).  -The food selection can satisfy anyone. Seriously.  Best appetizer? Spinach and Artichoke Dip.  Best entree? I couldn't choose just one...

Sure, it can be noisy/busy, but as long as your server keeps you happy -- which he/she will -- the ambiance is pretty fun/inviting.  Anyway, give BJ's a chance.

Went in on a slow Tuesday night for happy hour & waited 11 minutes for anyone to stop and acknowledge us at our table (the manager walked by 5 times doing nothing). Once served, part of our order was forgotten and still on the bill (even though I let the waitress know) & took another 15 minutes to get my check so at that point I didn't want to wait another 15-20 minutes for that to get adjusted and just paid the full amount.

Candy R.,"San Francisco, CA",150,40,5,2.0,6/18/2012,"Perhaps because we decided to patron BJ's in Concord on Father's Day, our experience left a lot to be desired!!! We walked into the lobby that was overflowing with people and no order! We decided to call ahead as stated by them, ""Call ahead and wait less time!"" - NOT TRUE!!! When we checked in the hostess told us 20mins. After waiting over 30mins in the stifling heat because the lobby was bombarded with people waiting, I checked back in to find out what was going on...they told me another 45mins!!! WTF??? OK, I get it! It's Father's Day; it's going to be crazy but jeez!!! The wait was one thing and I understand. But the food was NOT GOOD at best!!! We are a family of big body eaters and every single one of us had left overs due to lack of quality in taste! Pizzas were bland and dry! The salads were a bit too tart for our taste and the baby back ribs were dry!!! The worst part was that I had my 3 year old son's food didn't come out until everyone else was done with their meals! We ended up feeding him from our plates. By the time his food came he didn't want it anymore! The server stated that someone stole his plate off of the food line! Really? And yet, it took over 20mins more to get mini corn dogs and fries out to a child?  I'm adamant about good customer service. BJ's extended no hospitality to rectify our experience of poor quality of food and lack of customer service! I'll stick to what I know...BJ's in my hood always comes through. I may give Concord another shot if and when it isn't a day dedicated to special people but until then....BOOOOOOO!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=480

Jonathan R.,"Concord, CA",257,886,1047,4.0,6/10/2013,"Great beer and good food, what more can you ask for. I was greeted by the hostess who asked me if I wanted to sick in the cocktail lounge because it's open seating. I tell her no, just a regular table and her attitude seemed to change from happy to not so happy. But I was seated pretty much right away. While I was waiting for Terri to come in our server Chris brought us both water. I noticed both the drink menu and the table were a little sticky. Finally Terri comes in and we place our orders. She ordered the Bison burger which was on there under 600 calories menu and I had the jalapeno burger cooked rare. Thank god it was actually cooked rare, I believe this is only the fifth place I've tried that have successfully cooked my burger the way I want it. The fried jalapenos and the pepper jack cheese with the spicy mayo gave it a great kick. However it was very uneven. Some bites would have the full spicy bite, and others would have no kick to it at all.  Instead of getting fries I decided to go with a dinner salad. It was OK but I've had better salads in less popular places. One thing I hate is whole tomato slices in a salad. I tried Terri's Bison burger and it was amazing. I would love to have switched but I knew that wasn't happening, haha. For dessert we ordered the triple sampler of Pazookie. Awesome stuff. We had the original which was a warm chocolate chip cookie and vanilla bean ice cream on top, raspberry and white chocolate cookie with vanilla bean ice cream, and red velvet  cake cookie with vanilla bean ( my personal favorite.) Our server was Chris and he was very good, saying yes sir, no sir, very polite young man. One thing though is after he would ask a question, or after we answer one, he would stand and stare for a second and then walk away. I tried there Piranha ale, and it was delicious.

Despite that, our server was super attentive ( I would rate her 5 stars) and accommodating in every way. We were craving burgers so this is where we landed since we were already at the mall. My sister ordered the Double Deluxe Burger without tomatoes, pickles and any condiments (i.e. no sauce). I ordered the Brewhouse burger w/ bacon, no pickles. When our burgers came, both were seemingly dry of any condiments. I understand that confusion since my sisters request was kind of odd when you read the description of the burger and there probably was just a mix up with our table. No big deal to me. I just asked our waitress for some mayo (which my burger originally was supposed to come with) and added it myself with some ketchup. This burger was still so bland!! Just no flavor at all except for the few bites I could taste the bacon. And the bun was soooo dry! I ended up picking off parts of it to get around the dryness. It was actually a chore to try and finish this thing. My sister said her burger was good but half of the bun had a weird mustardy type of sauce on it. I got the wedge cut fries, her the crispy thin and both were very tasty. Next time I think I would try one of their signature pizza's.

I had the Hefeweizen and OMG! - it was the best Hefeweizen I had ever had and probably one of the top 5 beers I had ever had in my life. (The best was the Guinness I had at the brewery in Dublin, Ireland.)  Anyway....just had to go back and take my wife Michele. She got a glass of the BJ's P.M. Porter to start with.  Our first order was for the calamari. Not the best calamari we had ever had, but darn close. Next came the pulled pork BBQ sliders, four of them on a plate with fries and cold claw. They were excellent but, 'What's with the coleslaw??""   What they served was a tease. About two good mouth fulls. I wouldn't be complaining if it wasn't so good. Hey BJs - how about at least doubling the amount served with the sliders! Another Hefeweizen for me (damn it was good!) and one for Michele, and we were just about done.  Then came dessert - Triple Chocolate Pizookie made with some Ghirardelli chocolate. It is a chocolate cookie -(more like a thin brownie) made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate and topped with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square.

BJ's uses an outside company to administer its frequent customer rewards program and this restaurant frequently fails to do what it needs to do to give guests the reward points they've earned for eating/drinking there.  When a guest notices the problem and complains, sometimes the restaurant fixes the mistake but it usually takes more than 10 minutes to do it.  Even worse, sometimes the management tries to blame it on the outside company and is not sincerely apologetic.  I think this restaurant is extremely lucky.  Much of its success is due to its prime location at the Sunvalley Mall. On the other hand, the steaks (when cooked to order) are usually superb, and many other selections are very nice.  It's great that servers always ask guests who order steaks to cut into the steaks in front of the servers to make sure the steaks are cooked correctly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=660

The lunch specials are fairly cheap, but you get what you pay for. The soup was too salty, the Caesar salad was bland, and the pizza was just awful. The dough didn't seem to be cooked enough. It was the mini size, so I suppose I should feel lucky I didn't order the large. It arrived to the table lukewarm, and by the time I was halfway through it was cold, the cheese was rubbery, and I was not at all satisfied.  Maybe I'm just picky, but if I order pizza, I expect it to arrive at the table piping hot, almost to the point where it burns your mouth. If I wanted cold food, I would have ordered a cold entree.  The waiter didn't even refill my soda until we were done with our meal. What was the point of that?  If you want slow service and a sub-par meal, then this would be the place for you.

Cindy N.,"Bay Area, CA",153,31,28,4.0,10/6/2010,"so i had my 21st birthday dinner here and i had reserved my birthday for 7:30pm the table wasn't even ready till 8:40pm that was like 50 min wait! i came in 10 min early just to tell them i was here but they still took hella long but i was fine with it in the end cause i guess it gave my guests to get acquainted with each other then when we finally sat down and my friends ordered some appetizers calamari which was pretty good which was $8.75 and the mozzarella sticks which i wasn't a big fan at the price $7.09 it was not worth it. Alex and Manny both had the hefeweizen they both liked it which was only $4.95 for good quality beer as all the guys told me which i wouldn't know since i never liked beer in the first place. My first drink of the night was PEACHY KEEN SANGRIA which was $5.75 this drink was really good it was made with Grey Goose L'Orange Vodka, Stoli Razberi Vodka, Beringer White Zinfandel, Monin white peach, pineapple and orange juices with a slash of grenadine which was in a pretty glass with a slice of orange and cherry i didn't expect it to be as strong as it would be cause i had a sangria at applebees and it tasted like juice to me. me and alex ordered a meduim great white pizza made with creamy Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, fresh Roma tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast which was hands down the best pizza ever bj's are famous for their deep dish pizza's they didn't have anymore medium great white so the waitress upgraded us to a large for the charge of a medium pizza wow super nice right?  my second drink was the strawberry confusion omg she spilled some on my dress but she was super sorry about it and got me some wet napkins and got me a new one this drink has to be my favorite drink of the night i downed it so quick it was made with Hpnotiq Liqueur, Stoli Razberi Vodka, pineapple juice and a splash of strawberry this drink was $8.50 i got 1 and a half glasses of this drink so i was happy! then she came out with my birthday pizoozkie and everyone started singing happy birthday to me aww and omg it was soo good it was right on point =) our bill came up to $185.89 and i had 12 people together at my dinner so it was 17% gratuity hehe i had such nice friends that dinner was on them i love them so much! overall it was all worth it and i would come back anytime!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=660

But that is where spectacular ends for me. Simply put...I feel it is overrated and overpriced as a whole. Service really needs a major overhaul... s l o o o o o w, inaccurate  and forgetful. Our visit was early lunch time; there were only a few tables of customers in the place. It took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged by the server. And by golly, service only went downhill from there. Our appetizer order was messed up miserably; it should have been comped but wasn't.  When the correct appetizer was finally served (after the meals), we were blown away by the poor  preparation of the potato skins. Toppings were incredibly sparse. Some skins had no cheese at all, others had no bacon... really sparse and lame for a spendy fee AND considering the order had originally been messed up by the server. Simply put- a huge ripoff. Boo. My salad cost $11.25 and was missing an ingredient. I couldn't tell the server because he didn't get to our table to check on us until we had almost finished our entrees. For $11.25, I had hoped for a HUGE salad...not. I was still hungry after finishing it.  Can't comment on the beers because we don't drink.

Natasha A.,"Vallejo, CA",80,39,2,2.0,4/4/2011,"This place seems to get worse and worse with each visit.  The first time I went here was when it first opened. The service was just ""ok"" and the food was decent. I figured that since the place was new, they were still trying to get their act together.  I have been there a few times since, and each time my experience seemed to be worse then the one before. The quality of their food has gone way down hill. Their sandwich combos are a joke. Sub-par sandwiches that I could have made better at home, and salads that are just soggy and wilted. Their soups have always been either too bland or too salty, and tasted as if they came straight out of a can. Their pizzas have also gone down hill. They are sloppily made, and have considerably less am mount of toppings then when they first opened (I know times are tough and places are trying to cut back, but skimping on pizza toppings to save a few pennies is not the way to do it.)  They last time we went, I decided to order a bunch of the ""small bite"" items to share with the table. At $4 - $6 a pop, I thought these would be good appetizer sized items that we can munch of while drinking a beer. These ""small bites"" were literally 3 or 4 bites each. I ordered the friend artichokes (awful tasting and overly greasy), and mozzarella salad (looked like a small mound of shredded cheese in brown sauce, and only have a few actual pieces of cheese in it) and the bruschetta (4 small sad pieces of cold bread with a couple chucks of tomato on top.) The items were so sad and pitiful looking, and they tasted so bland and awful, I should have just saved my money and used it to buy another beer.  The only good this this place has going for it is that they have a wide selection of beers. Other then that, the food is horrible, and their service is slow, and even for the moderately prices menu I would not even waste my money on the food.  I'll only go here again is my friends really want to go there (and if they pay for me) but other then that, there are many more places with better food to go to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=680

The service is o.k.  Being that their audience is the young crowd, the waitstaff is also very young and maybe not so attentive/experienced, the way you would like.  Our service has been o.k. overall.  But, my most recent experience was that it took a very, very long time to get our food.  When the food did finally start coming, the orders were wrong and the food was cold.   The food.  This is where this place fails miserably.  They DO have generous helpings.  Just about everything sets you up for a nice meal.  The atmosphere, the prices, the niceness.  Everything is just o.k.  I wouldn't mind if the prices were less or the 'expectations' were less.  My burger, was not cooked right/overdone.  (I asked for medium rare).  But, o.k. no biggie.  It was lukewarm.  It wasn't juicy at all.  Not much in the way of condiments on the burger either.  A simple mid-level burger and they messed up!  I'd rather pay a lot less, get it faster, get it better at In N Out!!!  I hate to be so harsh.   The previous times I've been here, I never really liked it either.  Just o.k.  Nothing to write home about.     One good thing, is that they have a lot of beers on tap and they have a full bar.  So, I think their audience is well served.  Just don't go for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=680

Justin M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,7,,5.0,9/19/2010,"Been to this location numerous time for happy hour and dinner. Great service and food every time. During happy hour I usually just order an appetizers  and drinks with friends with friends. The appetizers are $2.00 off regular price, which usually comes  out to $6.50ish. I wish that happy hour prices were half off like other places. I recommend getting the nachos and the spinach dip. They serve you a large amount and they are very good. Tried the calamari and the chicken lettuce wrap and they  were just alright. For dinner the deep dish pizza are a must. Ive tried the bbq chicken pizza and it is my favorite one. The sauce was not too sweet or tangy, just right. Then the chicken was perfect and not over cooked. The only other pizza i've tried is the Mediterranean. This pizza was alright. I a little too salty for my taste. Toppings include pest, roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes. For desert I get a pizookie. They give you the options for different kinds of cookie and to go half and half. I look forward to this every time I got to BJ's The service has always been great at this location, whether I am eating during happy hour or dinner. The hostess and servers are very friendly and always have  great smiles. It doesn't look like they hate their jobs or are waiting to get off shift. One time our server forgot one of our appetizers and our pizza came out before it had. She asked us if we still would like the dish but we declined. Couldn't fault her, it looked like a busy night and it happens. No complaints from us or anything. The manager came up to us and apologized for the mistake and gave us the appetizer anyways, for free. This was soooo legit. Great food at every bj's location, but what makes this one my favorite is the proximity to the mall and the great service.

I pouted about having to attend my husbands Christmas/Winter Solstace/Kwanzaa/Hanukkah dinner here.  But I went because..well, he is my husband....and he promised to take me to Vinnie's afterward for a real drink.  (score) We arrive, we are greeted and we are seated.  Everyone orders a drink from very polite waitresses and we make small talk.  The drinks arrive and I'm completely in heaven!

My honey and I shared a sandwich and fries cuz I was full of booze (go figure) and not very hungry - from what I remember the sanwich was good. All in all I left impressed: from the service, to the bar to the food.

Lani P.,"American Canyon, CA",13,3,10,2.0,1/11/2010,"Our latest visit to BJ's was a very disappointing one.  Our server, while mildly polite, was horrible.  Her name is Natalie.  We ordered 6 sodas, only 3 of which had straws.  Upon requesting more straws, she sarcastically said, ""I don't have straws with me, but I can bring you some.""  She never did.  We had to flag down the hostess who then brought us straws. She then gave us a stack of small plates for our appetizers at the end of the table.  When we started passing them out, we noticed that several of them were dirty on the bottoms, with chocolate or BBQ sauce, which got all over our hands.  Upon telling her about this, she said, ""It's probably just chocolate sauce.  I'll bring you some clean ones.""  She did not apologize at all for the dirty plates, and when we requested wet wipes for our hands, she said that you did not have those.  Which was confusing, because on another occasion at BJ's, we thought we remembered receiving wet wipes with our buffalo wings or rib orders? Our food took a very long time to come.  Throughout our meal she did not come back to check on us, or notice that we had many dirty plates and glasses to taken away and/or refilled.  While we were there, the couple across the way from us were seated and ignored by her, so they ended up leaving without ordering. At the beginning of our visit, we mentioned that we had a birthday at our table and she patronizingly said Happy Birthday to my son.  It wasn't until my mother-in-law inquired again before we left about something for the birthday boy, that she said that he does get a dessert.  I don't believe she would've mentioned that if we didn't ask. We had been excited about going to BJ's this visit, however, the experience was really bad.  While we did leave Natalie a tip, it wasn't nearly what she would've received if she had actually taken care of us.  In fact, it was probably still more than she deserved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=720

Krystal A.,"Martinez, CA",1,13,7,1.0,8/23/2014,"Me and 5 of my friends went to the BJ's in concord last night and we literally had the WORST service EVER! If I could give 0 stars, I would. First off, we called about 40 minutes prior to us arriving for their call ahead seating for up to 6 people in your party. When we arrived at 8pm we told the host that we did the call ahead seating and stated the name is was under, they could not find my friends name that she put it under. Then they continued to explain to us that our wait time starts when we arrive, I asked what's the point of call ahead seating then and she said that she thinks calls ahead seating should only be for parties of 5 and under. So then, we waited our 30 minutes to be seated and then waiting about another 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. When our server greeted us he took our drink order right away, but then didn't see him for about 20 minutes. When he arrived with our drinks he then stated that he forgot to ring in one of my friends drinks from the bar, well we all already knew how long their drinks from the bar take so needless to say my friend was bummed that he was going to have to wait another 20 minutes to get his drink. After we got our 1st round of drinks he never asked us if we were ready to order or anything, he just dropped our drinks and left, he came back about 15 minutes later and took our order for our dinner (this is around 930pm, we've been at our table for an hour before he took our dinner order). At the time he took our dinner order we all ordered another round of drinks. It took probably 30 minutes for us to get our dinner and when it arrived, my friend ordered a large pizza and my boyfriend ordered a small pizza, the guy who brought our pizzas didn't say watch your hands, hot plates, no he just slid the hot pizza pans across he table and almost burnt my boyfriends hand if he didn't move it on time. Then it took about another 15 minutes for us to get our drinks and this time he OVER ordered drinks, some of us didn't want another round and I even had a non alcoholic drink and I never got another one. Lets just say our server was VERY overwhelmed and desperately needed help with his tables. When it came time for our bill to come he just dropped it and walked away, I numbered everything 1,2, 3 (there was 3 couples) and told him to just split everything with the numbers on the side of what was ordered, he then said ""I will try, but its going to take while to do this for you"" ... If I already numbered everything for you it shouldn't take that long. 15 minutes later he comes and just gives everyone a receipt with no booklet and he STILL got things wrong and put other peoples items on eachothers checks! We got there at 8pm and left at 11pm!! I have never had that bad of service ever!

Not to mention the pasta itself was still hard! The service was horrible. Our waitress mentioned she had another big party like ours, but I guess she was more attentive on the other table... I don't mean to put you on blast, but our waitress, Mallory was horrible. She was rude, and rushing to kick us out when we were still eating our dinner asking if we wanted dessert. C'mon now! She's quite entertaining though, but that's about it. The automatic 17% gratuity isn't what you deserve.

Jonathan R.,"San Francisco, CA",694,47,4,2.0,6/13/2011,"I had heard so many great things about BJ's that I couldn't wait to go and try out their signature burger and their Ultimate Long Island.  But there were too many things wrong with my experience: Strike 1: I tried their signature BJ's Burger with additional bacon, and the sandwich is served on a toasted garlic french roll instead of a traditional hamburger bun.  Oddly enough, I didn't taste any garlic at all while biting into the roll.  I had asked for my burger to be cooked medium-rare, and it was served medium-well.  (At least the wedge-cut seasoned fries made up for the burger's lack of flavor and juiciness!) Strike 2: I was a bit disappointed in their Ultimate Long Island Iced Tea.  It was watered down and had a dark amber color instead of the light blond color it should have.  Lo and behold, with my first sip, my taste buds were assaulted with the sweet taste of PEPSI instead of the signature Coke.  It also had notes of orange and other things that I do not believe should be in anything called a Long Island.  (After drinking it, I looked up the ingredients online and realized that it is created with vodka, gin, rum, orange liquer, sweet & sour and Pepsi instead of the classic vodka, tequila, rum, gin, triple sec, sweet & sour, and Coke.)  The mixture they serve is definitely NOT recommended. Strike 3: The area in which we were seated was facing a window at sunset.  As the sun set behind the building, it suddenly came into view and the waitstaff could not adjust the blinds in any fashion to prevent the searing white light from blinding us as we ate.  Apparently, part of the blinds above the window cannot be adjusted. Anyway, the burger and the ""Long Island"" cost me $30.  I guess the only good thing was that the Dallas Mavericks won the NBA championship while I was there! NOTE: The floors are extremely slippery, so make sure you are wearing a decent pair of non-slip tennis shoes or boots that are made with recycled radial tires.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=720
Linda M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",394,604,61,3.0,11/27/2009,"This type of restaurant isn't my thing, but loving 2 guys that *live* sports, we thought we'd check it out. I kept thinking Outback (with more focus on pizza and sandwiches over red meat). My guys were happy with all the sports on big screens, as was my son's picky eater friend with his meal, and I enjoyed the red beer. The service, though slow at times, was better than McCovey's, which has a similar sports bar vibe.  We were prepared for a long wait, but were pleasantly surprised when the quoted 45 minutes was really more like 20. Plus they brought pizza slices around to give to patrons waiting for tables. Once we were seated, drinks and salad came quickly. Main entrees took quite a while. We'd been warned about big portions, so hubby and I split the roast beef dip which came with a huge mountain of fries (choose thin and crispy or wedge). The sandwich itself wasn't anything to write home about and was much more bread than meat. Luckily, we'd added the wedge salad (also to split), which was, again nothing special.  The kids meals came with drinks (although we had to ask for a lemonade to be removed from the bill and point out to the server that it was one of the drinks listed on the kids menu). Also they serve those nasty reconstituted happy face potatoes, which the kids didn't love. They should just use the fries they serve adults. You can add a good-sized kid's sundae for 95 cents.  The kids were excited about their specialty ice cream on cookie dessert, the pizookie...so we ordered a ""trio"" which offered 3 mini versions of it with your choice of flavors. Of course they ran out of cookies and cream (aka oreo), so both kids had to go with their 2nd choice flavor. Dessert took so long to come that we later joked they must have been baking them individually with a light bulb, easy bake oven style. The cookie part you had to dig out of a little metal pan.  I'd have preferred just a regular old brownie with ice cream to the triple chocolate version I tried.  Food gets two stars, +1 for good beer, friendly (but slow) service and entertaining for my guys.  Next time I'll probably try a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=720
Angela G.,"Hercules, CA",36,68,81,2.0,3/1/2012,"I never usually had problems at BJ's before but when I went recently with my family for my cousins 19th birthday there were a few problems. First of all, I went in about 15 minutes before my family got there so I got a reservation and I let the hostess know that there was going to be 7 of us. She gave me a buzzer thing and told me to let them know when they get here. When my cousins got there, they told us they had a table ready for us but it was only able to seat 6 people. Clearly, I told the hostess there was going to be SEVEN of us. So we had to wait an additional 10 minutes which wasn't so bad. Another host gave me another buzzer and told us it would go off when a bigger table was available. When the buzzer finally went off I gave it to the original hostess who was assisting me and my family and she looked confused and didn't know what was going on. So i explained to her that another host gave me a NEW buzzer. She then made us wait an additional 15 minutes. When we finally get seated, they put us OUTSIDE secluded from everyone. The heaters were not strong enough, and it was cold. Our first waitress was nice although she seemed like she hated her job. After her shift was over, she then introduced us to another server who would be assisting us for the rest of the evening. He was a lot nicer and lively but disappointed me when he said they didn't have any more beignets :( Don't get me wrong, it's a good restaurant but I do NOT like their customer service.

The spinach and artichoke dip, although pretty good, gave me a massive case of heartburn, and I'm not exactly opposed to greasy food. The beer is alright, nothing mind-blowing, the Jeremiah Red is my personal favorite. Would probably be 3-4 stars if not for the hideous service at this place. The first time I went there, it was busy, but not packed. There were tables available and there was no wait to eat. Had to wait 20+ minutes for my appetizer, and even though I ordered the beer BEFORE the meal, the beer came about 2 minutes before the actual meal came. I complained to the manager and left no tip. I decided to give it another chance, and although the service was better, there were maybe 5 other parties there at that time and I still felt like I had to send up a smoke signal to get my waitresses' attention.

Those turned out pretty dry, but the amount of food was definitely worth the price.  We also shared a pizookie party platter among us. They got the order wrong and brought out a regular pizookie.

It's not too big but they still have a nice selection of their beers.  There is more and more of a wait each time we go -- good for them, annoying for us. Service is still I think a bit hiccup-y.  Our orders usually get messed up and no one fixes things but nothing major.  (2 people ordered thing fries, got wedge instead, when we brought it to the server's attention she said she'd bring us another plate but never returned except to give us our bill) The hostesses and servers are all very friendly and probably have been trained to do so, but I think some of them stop thinking and are on auto-pilot.   It's a bit pricier, but the inside is still nice and we come here occasionally anyways.  So apparently it's good enough.  Oh right, the food is ok, mostly just whelming -- not over, not under.  I tend to get the Angus Roast Beef Dip (French dip) and happy with that.  I would not recommend their BBQ beef and Chicken plate -- small serving sizes and dry.  That is just from one experience though so who knows.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=780

Michelle N.,"Hercules, CA",125,221,41,2.0,12/12/2009,"The family and I stopped in at lunch on a pre-Christmas Friday to have something to eat before taking the little one to see Santa Claus. We arrived right around noonish and was expecting more of a wait but luckily we got seated right away in one of the last tables available. (We were very lucky -- just a few minutes later, all the tables were full and a long wait for tables started!!) This was the first time I've ever been to a BJ's so I didn't know what to order. Sis got the house made orange cream soda; I got a cream soda plus a lemonade for the little one. We also ordered some calamari to share. Eventually, my parents joined us and we ordered our entrees. Their lunch specials covered most bases and we all found something we wanted; sis got a hamburger, Dad got a french dip, Mom got jambalaya and I got some hamburger sliders. We also got a chicken tender entree for the little one. Our calamari came out maybe fifteen minutes after we ordered it, which wasn't so bad. The calamari itself was delicious! Very tender, well breaded and good sauces. Nice job, BJ's! And then came the entree wait. Even accounting for the lunch rush, we waited over a half hour for our lunch entrees AFTER our appetizer came out. If you've ever been to a restaurant with a fussy toddler, you know that this is torture!! Our waitress didn't seem that attentive though we got our refills without asking for them. When we finally got our food, it was still another ten minutes before my dad's food came. The burgers were pretty dry so we asked for extra mayo; it never came. The food itself was okay. I liked my sliders but would have liked them more if I had steak sauce or mayo to help lubricate the darn things. My mom liked her jambalaya and my dad liked his french dip but would have liked more au jus to go with it. Like me, sis' burger was pretty dry so she ended up just eating my mom's food. All in all, a pretty mediocre experience. I don't know if I'll be back, especially with a toddler in tow. While BJ's has a kids menu with a neat pack of crayons, I wouldn't call them kid friendly. The place is loud and the lights are low, two things which sort of set my easily overstimulated toddler into high alert. Their high chairs also seem sort of small. My little one is pretty small, at the tail end of the growth scale, but I found it extremely difficult to put her in the high chair and she seemed very uncomfortable in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=760

Erin G.,"New York, NY",20,52,37,4.0,10/24/2009,"Overall, despite being hectically busy and a bit rowdy with larger parties, I had a more-than-satisfactory experience with BJ's.   My bf and I got there just before 6pm on a Saturday night, an intimidating mass of people already outside.  As one person put it, ""there's no recession here.""  For our party of 2, we were quoted 45-60 minutes; seated in about 30.   Our server welcomed us warmly and took our drink order right away.  The root beer made on site is tasty.  I ordered a hot tea that came with a little kettle for extra hot water.  A moat of hot water started to grow around the kettle and we figured out that the kettle was actually leaking.  That's okay, though.  It led to a pleasant conversation about rates of change, high school calculus, and physics (""Physics B is basically a place to learn gang signs.  Right-Hand Ruuule!""); and the server we alerted brought out a replacement kettle in no time. The atmosphere was typical for a busy restaurant: people running all over.  However, I never felt cramped.  Yes, there are TVs, but they're high enough on the walls you can avoid looking at them.  We were right next to a group of 10 celebrating a 20-something's birthday.  Typical ""classy"" affair.  Like the kettle-situation, it was also bittersweet.  (""WHERE'S OUR SERVER?"" followed by ""Shut UP, birthday girl."" cackle cackle). Our food came quickly.  We ordered the Cajun Pasta and the Jambalaya, which came in quantities enough to take half home.  Both dishes were tasty, though I preferred the pasta since it had subtler flavors.  We also got the Pizookie (my first time here; I need to be initiated to BJ's).  It came a little slower, but it was a nice substitute to the long-gone giant cookie sandwich at Elephant Bar.   When we were finished, our server took care of our check in a timely fashion, bid us a great night, and we were out of there before anyone could sing a drunken Happy Birthday.  I'll be back, but maybe until after the hype cools down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=760

Azam H.,"Concord, CA",64,43,1,2.0,1/19/2010,"I received a pre-opening invitation for BJ's back in October 2009. It was good for 4 people, so my wife and I invited another couple to join us there to try it out.  The location used to be Houlihan's in the Sun Valley Mall. It's been completely gutted, redesigned, and rebuilt. It's very modern and upscale now with a great (and very long) bar with huge flat screen TVs above it.  The menu is quite large (not as big as Cheesecake Factory, but big) and the food choices seem similar. The food was complimentary in exchange for a donation to the charity of the night, and we had to pay for any alcohol ordered. (More on that later)  We were told to order four different meals to ""test the kitchen staff"" and were offered the choice of appetizer or dessert. The flat bread pizza appetizer was good as were the four meals.  One annoying aspect of the evening was they kept trading out our waiters every 20min or so. By the end of the meal, we felt we had about 6 different waiters throughout the night. They said it was for training, but it left us feeling a bit discarded. Despite all these waiters visiting our table, a typical gripe still emerged: no one would remove our finished meal plates and you are forced to stare at them or move them aside yourself - a common theme at many restaurants these days.  Now we're down to the last parts of the meal, (the plates are finally gone) the check has been dropped, and we've already paid the bill. The other husband and I are finishing our beers, when a completely different waitress comes up and asks, ""Would you like me to top those off for you?"" I ask, ""You mean our beers?"" And she she says, ""Yes, top them off."" I said OK and she took our not-quite finished beers with her.  She comes back with two full beers - and right behind her is our most-recent waiter with ANOTHER BILL FOR TWO MORE BEERS. I was totally put off by her topping off ""offer"" rather than making it clear she was selling us 2 additional beers. We weren't even finished with the ones we had - which we would have before ordering another round.  They might not be good at picking up plates, but they sure know how to get another bill worked up and dropped off! Hell, he almost beat the beers to the table.  I was all set to take this up with the manager, as I felt we were duped into purchasing more beer; but my friend ended up paying the second bill when I went to the restroom, thus avoiding any more involvement with their staff.

And speaking of the food, do NOT order a burger here. Seriously, this was among the sorriest burgers I have ever been served, including in military chow halls. I have had better burgers in remote areas of Europe where they don't know what a burger is, and just give you a fried clod of mystery meat. I asked for it medium rare and got it charred well. Served cold, cheese not even starting to melt at the edges. Four-day-old stale bun, bone dry. Sad little remnants of pickle and tomato inside, cut from the stem-ends. Cold greasy bacon that smelled like a KFC dumpster. And all of this assembled in the strafing fashion, scattered across the plate like it had tried to run and been machine-gunned down.

Home brewed root beer was excellent though, and I am a pretty big fan of Root Beer. lots of tv's with sports on around but takes the social life away because you usually have to look up and away from anyone else to see them, not the best place for families in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=760
Meena P.,"Concord, CA",2,61,,1.0,5/22/2012,"So this place has steadily gone down hill!  Hubby and i went for dinner on a Friday night a week ago. I use to love BJ's restaurant. So it being a Friday night, it was plenty busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table. It took forever for our waitress to come to us. She said she was swamped as they had just sat 3 tables in her area and she already had a full house.  Ok, no problem. We ordered a cesear's salad, large veggie pizza and drinks. So this time since we had so much time while waiting for service, I started reading the menu. I read that the veggie pizza comes on their whole wheat crust - Aha!  The previous time we came here I asked my server if our pizza was on whole wheat crust (again it was a veggie) and he assured us that it was not. I had my doubt as it tasted sweet and not like the usual crust.  So, now after reading the menu I realized that our last waiter did lie to us about the crust.  So this time I made sure to request the white crust.  I find the whole wheat crust quite gross, it's so sweet and pizza crust in my opinion should not be sweet! Anyway, we got our salad and it was half the size it normally is so I asked the waitress if they had changed their portions and she said no that this was a side salad. Hubby and I were sharing the salad but the portion turned out to be fine. We got our pizza and it was ugly. It literally looked like the chef (and I use that term loosely) had just thrown our toppings on the pizza, not only that it looked like in the cutting they first cut it wrong and then tried to correct it. It was the ugliest pizza. there were areas without sauce or toppings just cheese.   I should have complained to the waitress but we barely got any service. I will definitely not be returning to this BJ's restaurant.  I have been to other locations and was satisfied with them.  I had written a note to the customer service contact form on their website and have yet to have anyone contact me.  It was such a disappointing experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=740

I got to order off the menu for the first time. My aunt actually ordered the California flat bread as an appetizer, it was to die for! It is a must get! When it was time to order I ordered the lunch pasta and salad. I chose the Alfredo fettuccine with chicken.  First came the salad and I wish it had more dressing but thats just me I like a lot. Then came my meal it was the perfect size amount for me. It is smaller than the actual dinner size.

We arrived at exactly 6:30PM, and we were told we had to wait. We waited for nearly 45 minutes. Our first dish came out at 8:08pm, which by that time, my friend had to leave to go to work. Everything was good, worth it the price, but that wait after reserving and calling was inexcusable. When we asked why we had to wait, they explained to us the whole process of what making a reservation meant, which is a little different from other places. I would not have been so disappointed if they had explained that over the phone when I called. If I had known, I probably would have made reservations elsewhere.

Pizza was almost raw dough in the middle, the service great again, the bathrooms look like a Greyhound station again (all three visits honestly) and the bar slow all three times as well.   Very mixed feelings on if I will go again.  They have great food potential with unfortunately very poor execution if the General manager is not looking over them like a hawk from my experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=740

Brett F.,"Danville, CA",235,38,6,1.0,7/16/2013,"I have a bone to pick with this place, so first the service sucks! i mean really this is the worst. I feel like i'd like this place more if they just spit in my food and gave it to me within a reasonable amount of time, then having to wait 30-45 minutes for a cheese burger. I am saying this not only during the slow times, but even in the busy times. I've caught my waiter/waitress on their phones and chit chatting instead of refilling my drink, or while holding my freshly poured beverage. secondly, the foods not that good. lastly, i lost my wallet here about a year ago and it took over 2 months to finally get the General Manager to look at the security tapes. after seeing that he couldn't make out if i put my wallet on the table or not he concluded that he couldn't help me further and that's how my problem was resolved. oh and in those 2 months i was on the phone with some guy claiming to be manager, who kept saying he would call me back and never did. i ended up speaking to 3 ""managers"" and non could help me.

Mike T.,"Harrison Township, NJ",35,90,121,2.0,1/10/2011,"Like many other people have mentioned, do not go here if you have anything you are planning to do later. Slow. Yes it was busy, and I get that, but they were so disorganized! I laughed when I read the review about the hostesses not knowing what they were doing. There were 3 hostesses and a manger all standing in there little command center up front, and all with that wax museum or deer in headlights look. I turned in my name and stood with my wife (8 months pregnant) for over an hour. To be fair, I was told it would be 45 minutes, so I went to the command center to get an ETA on our table. She asked for my name, then asked me how many in my party. Um, no, I've been standing here in front of you for over an hour, I didn't just walk in. I told her that I had checked in with her over an hour ago, and she calls a huddle with the rest of the crew. No one knew what happened, or how my name disappeared from their computer, so I was told that our table was coming up soon. The funny thing was, someone else complained about the wait earlier, and I heard one of the hostesses comment that there was a pregnant lady that has been waiting a long time too. Once again, I know that it's busy. But if you see that you are seating people ahead of people that have become a fixture in front of you, you may want to check on your ""system"".  So we get seated at a table near the back of the room. A booth for the pregnant lady would have been nice instead of the wooden chair, there were plenty available, but whatever. We then wait 10 more minutes as servers walk by. A couple of guys get seated at a booth behind us and order drinks. I couldn't even grab anyone's attention to find out which server was ours. The guys at the booth behind us get their drinks. I was about to sneak water off one of the empty tables when I decided I had enough. I went back to the command center, but the manager had gone off somewhere, so I asked the Three-headed hostess if we had a server. They said they would check on it. Our server apologized, and was friendly, but everything was still slow. No refills on drinks, and took a while to get our check. Our server suspected we didn't have a great experience, so he got us a free dessert. Add one star. So 3 hours after we walked in, we were walking out to our car, wondering how we ended up in the BJ's time machine again. Were we going to some movie or something after this? Am I late for work? What day is it? Quick Marty, your parents are in trouble back in 1985, get in the car!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=840

About a half hour later we got a table at the bar. However it took another 20 minutes to have a server come and greet us and take our order. We ordered a pitcher of their Indian red beer and a large combination. Beer was nice and cold. Pizza seemed like it was pre-made and barely warm or was sitting out for a long time.

I've never had to wait long for a table and their employee's are super friendly. Their menu is extensive, which makes choosing something difficult with so many choices. Everything I've had there has been wonderful.  They have a great full bar but I've only had their beers, which are great!! Its refreshing to have yet another choice for good food and beer in Concord.

I ordered the creole tilapia and my friend ordered the tuscan chicken limone. Both were very delicious and for dessert we had the pizookie trio. It was yummy!

The salad itself was good but mine had like a chicken finger on top, and my mother's deli turkey. The soups were nothing special, we had minestrone and broccoli cheddar. The wine was good though (haha). The waitress was very nice, but the place was very busy. The gal that brought our soups was very short and pretty much threw the soups at us.

S C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,34,4,1.0,8/12/2013,"On Saturday night, my kids and I were seated outside on the patio for dinner. After 20 minutes of sitting without seeing a server, another group was being seated next to us so I asked the hostess if a server could come greet us and take our order. Before the server, Jonathan, could get out, 2-3 more tables had been sat after we had sat on the patio for all this time alone other than another couple who was already finished and just hanging out.  Jonathan FINALLY shows up and proceeds to take all the orders around us and was heading back in until I spoke up. The service went even worse from there. My beer comes in a warm glass so it was barely cold when I did finally receive it. By now, the patio is filled up. 30 minutes go by and not a word from the server. Other tables around us were getting their food who had arrived and ordered after us. I ask about our food from another server who had brought items to other surrounding tables. She finally finds our food and my girls' burgers weren't even hot and my son's macaroni and cheese was a big blob with the top crusted over and dry from sitting under the heat lamps too long. Disgusting. He barely ate it and just had apple sauce. I would have sent it back but I doubted that we wold have ever seen it again so poor thing, he just ate what he could of it. My girls picked at their burgers and left most of it on the plate.  Jonathan's customer service skills leave A LOT to be desired and if I was sat in his section again, if I ever go there again - which will be a LONG time - I would ask to be moved.  Drinks didn't get refilled until we were literally minutes away from leaving. I had to ask for my bill and we waited 10 minutes for Jonathan to return with it so we could leave. I spent $50 for a horrible dinner and even worse customer service. For the money you spend at BJ's, do yourself a favor and go someplace else. Their service is ALWAYS, notoriously slow but this was ridiculous.

Minus 1 star because our waitress was one of the fakest girls I've ever had serve me and she had the inability to actually listen. I orderd the fettucini alfredo (chicken free) and it came with chicken on it, which was fine I just took the chicken home to my dogs, but if I were on a budget it would matter because the dish is 2 bucks more with the chicken.  For desert we ordered the chocolate pizooki with chocolate chips and batter and she failed to listen and brought normal chocolate chip, we did not want to wait for them to prepare another so we just ate it and it tasted good, however I still firmly believe that the waitress was a bimbo.

Ken L.,"San Francisco, CA",88,407,28,1.0,6/17/2010,"What the fuck happened to this place? It was average food for high prices to begin with, but now, where do I begin. Our lunch crew came here on Wednesday. We had to wait to be seated because it's always busy now for some unknown reason. Our waiter took a while to first come to us, and then he asked us what drinks we wanted. He also asked about appetizers, which I'm kind of tired of being asked about. I'm just here for lunch man - give me my food - let me the fuck out. And their prices are ridiculous already; I don't need to pay more for something none of us want.  Our waiter disappears, then comes back with our drink orders, then takes our lunch orders...finally. He leaves, times passes, and some unknown dude, let's call him X, comes to our table with some soup. Who ordered the blah blah blah soup. You know who? Nobody at this fucking table! That's who. Ironically, sadly, my friend did order soup, but that one was not it. So our main dishes come out, which is served by some unknown person, let's call her Y. All around us it seems like they are trying to deliver the food by some method of random selection. Maybe if I just throw the food up in the air at some random table, maybe, just maybe, it will land at the correct table. Whatever system they are using, it sucks! Girl Y goes away after laying down 3 of the 4 plates of food, I think. It's gotten very confusing at this point, even for me. I can't remember who delivers plate 4, but my friend eventually flags down our waiter to bring out her soup. I look at her right after she takes her first taste of soup, or chili, or whatever it was. Uh, she looks like she has just eaten chili flavored with cat piss, which is what she says it tastes like. I wonder if it can really be that bad, so in my ignorance I try some. Wow, I don't know what it taste like, but it taste really weird, and I don't blame her for not eating another bite.  On to the other friend's, who got sandwiches, delivered COLD! They are not supposed to be cold if you are wondering. Oh, and I think stale bread was pretty much the norm. My fish was okay, but the best part of everyone's meal was the chips, errrr, fries. We contemplated whether they ordered them from McDonald's though.  I don't know if the entire regular staff was home watching the World Cup, which I hope is the case for them, but even if not, I doubt we will make our way back here. Massive Fail. Gargantuan Fail. Fail the size of Colossal Squid. Hrm, should I go there?

Anne P.,"Richmond, CA",1,11,,2.0,11/21/2009,"I love BJs and had eaten at the one in SSF and Vacaville... super-stoked to find out that it was opening nearby in Concord!! My BF and I arrived last Thursday night around 9pm. The wait wasn't long.  We order a Sprite, beer, avocado eggrolls, soups, and 2 New York Strip steaks - I ask for ""medium rare."" Instead of Sprite, I get a watered down drink and ask the waiter for another one. After the fact he tells me that it's Sierra Mist, which is still fine. So after several minutes, I notice that that he still didn't replace my drink. I had to ask another waiter who was delivering my BF's beer for another drink. The Sierra Mist was watered down again, so I just asked for a Pepsi - tasted better.  Then..... we get our soups and then our steaks... wtf.... what about the avocado eggrolls?? (I heard our waiter repeat the order and it did include the eggrolls.) They had been forgotten as the cooks in the back started to make it as soon as we mentioned we didn't get them. Anyways we start on our steaks, I not so adamently.  The steak was already cold waiting several minutes for someone to bring us A1 steak sauce and kethcup -  the manager finally did. At this time they realize their bad service. Great, so we get our eggrolls and then as I take a couple more bites of my steak and really look at it.... I realize it is not ""medium rare""... it is just rare... pink throughout and did not taste cooked at all........ WTF again! **Okay, who are you hiring.. were these people screened so you know that they can cook a freakin' steak, right??**  Anyone can easily undercook steak which is all about ""TIMING"" & attention. When you mess up on a NY strip, sorry, but it's almost unforgiveable. So finally after the waiter apologized sincerely and the manager offered free dessert and for us to only pay for the drinks (a small bill to pay under horrible circumstances).... I couldn't believe that this happened..... this has never happened to me before........... I gave a hefty tip because after all that, the manager and our waiter were trying to reach out to us and I didn't want to short-change anyone who was actually doing their job right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=860

Alyssa G.,"San Francisco, CA",847,520,103,4.0,2/21/2010,"BJ's feels very much like a gigantic sports bar. It probably is. I joined a friend for Happy Hour here on Thursday. We walked in a bit early (nearly 4pm) and headed straight for the bar. Our bartender was energetic, helpful and very knowledgeable about all their draft beers....and trust me there's a lot!  I like when places give you samples to try before you buy. She definitely helped us out there...I was able to sample a ""Nutty Brunette"" and a ""Jeremiah Red."" Gotta go with the red for round 1. After talking and drinking, I realized that I was starting to feel a bit loopy and ordering food would be the best idea. Mini Pizzas were 1/2 off, and so of course we had to get one: Margherita Mini deep-dish pizza. Not salty, felt a bit light yet filling enough to eliminate the buzz. That can't happen so we decided to order another round...this time she let us sample the Lindeman's Framboise, and a pear sparkling cider (sorry, didn't catch the name). Lindeman's Framboise was my choice, a sweet raspberry fizzy cider-like beverage. Not as heavy as a malt beverage like Mike's Hard Lemonade. By the time we were done, the restaurant had filled up and the room was a-flutter with people talking about how glad they are to be done with work for the day. Never knew there were this many people in Pleasant Hill. Good to know. Total: $25ish for 4 alcoholic drinks and a mini-pizza",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=860

Bebe E.,"San Francisco, CA",239,107,7,2.0,1/4/2010,"Let's get this straight, food gets 2 stars, management gets 1, but our server, Candi, gets a 5 star rating.  I would even give her 6 if it was possible. But let me explain the distribution.  My buddy and I came here one night, we hadn't seen each other in months since he'd moved out to walnut creek, and BJs is always a chill, laid back place to go, throw back a few beers, pay too much for barely decent food, but a fun sports bar atmosphere. If you want to actually read a review for the food/beer, please see others reviews on this place.  Mine is for the service. Candi is an incredibly friendly, outgoing gal.  Everytime I've been to a BJs in my life, the servers do the bare minimum to skim along acceptable service and recieve their tip.  Candi kept my friend and I entertained all night, gave us great suggestions on the menu, I felt like we had bonded to become best friends in the 2 hours we sat at her booth.  Basically, some of the greatest service I have EVER received, not only at BJs, but at any restaurant I've been to.  And as I work in the restaurant industry, I should know how service should be.   Anyways, as the night goes on, she tells us how ever since she had her son, guys don't leave their numbers like they used to.  Well after we had paid, i prompted my buddy to leave our numbers because not only was it kind of an ongoing joke with her, but she seemed like a really fun girl for my friend to chill with.   So on the way out, I ask to speak to the manager.  Give him a glowing review of our experience, and walk out of the restaurant, beaming because she just made our night.   Well lo and behold, she leaves us a voicemail later that night saying that her manager thought we had been friends of hers and she asked us to tell him that she had done a great job.  excuse my language but WTF!?!?!?! how unprofessional can you be? Just because I'm a young adult and still in college, you disrespect my opinion?  Well sir, I will not be gracing your restaurant with my presence ever again and to be honest, Candi is too good to serving in your dump of a corporate chain, and I hope she moves on to bigger and better things. /end vent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=880

Carl T.,"Oakley, CA",59,12,,4.0,7/7/2010,"My daughter suggested this place the other day when we were at the Sunvalley Mall. I'm glad we went, because we were not disappointed.  The food and beers are really good.   When seated, the first thing you notice is the extensive menu.  I think it's over 15 pages long.  Plenty of choice, that's for sure.  We started with an order of the deep fried cheese sticks.  They were cooked perfectly and the mozzarella cheese inside tasted like they had just made the cheese sticks by hand in back from fresh mozzarella.  We asked our server if they were made fresh, but she didn't know.  She promised to ask, but she never did, so I don't know the answer.  I do know that we are, as embarrassed as I am to say it, cheese stick connoisseurs, and these were some of the best we have ever had.   I had the Blonde beer as a drink.  It was light and tasted like  a fine ""German"" beer.  I liked it very much.  For my meal, I had the BBQ beef sandwich with the thin cut fries.  The meal was delicious.  The beef was nice and tender and had just the right amount of sauce.  But the best part was the bun.  Fresh, soft on the inside, just a little ""crunch"" as you bite into the bun.  I would order it again, no problem.   My wife had the potato skins for her meal. She wasn't happy with them.  They looked good and there was plenty of them.  However, the amount of cheese in them was anemic.  Compared to the other meals we had on the table, you would think these things would be over flowing with cheese.  Not the case.  She only ate one or two of them and we brought the rest home for the dog.   My daughter had a 1/2 pound Angus cheeseburger.  She loved it.  It was cooked just right and the meat was very tender.  Once again, the bun was the star of the show.  Toasted just right, soft on the inside, just enough of a crunch when you bit into it.  The burger was so big that she only ate half and save the rest for later that day.  The service was not the best I ever had.  There was the inevitable ""I'm going on a 30 minute break"" from our server and someone else took over our table.  It wasn't terrible service, but it could of been better.   But I'm not done yet, because the next day we had the opportunity to visit BJ's again.  We wanted the try the deep dish pizza that they serve.  Me and my daughter order a pizza, but with no tomatoes.  (They put fresh tomatoes on the top, not my daughters favorite)  And of course, the pizza came out with the tomatoes on top.  We pointed this out and the food server immediately offered for us to take that pizza home, which we did, and the food server went and put our order in again and had the pizza remade.   It was well worth the wait.  The toppings were plentiful.  But what really makes the pizza is the dough.  The dough is crunchy on the outside and when you take a bite it just melts in your mouth.  Is SO GOOD!  Can't emphasis this enough.  We really enjoyed the pizza.  I highly recommend it.   My wife had the french dip this time and wasn't disappointed this time.  The roast beef on the sandwich just melted in your mouth.  Plenty of cheese on the sandwich.  The horseradish sauce was very tasty.   For dessert we had a ""pizookie"", which is a fresh baked cookie that is baked in a little ""deep dish"" cookie pan.  We tried the chocolate/chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  Just delicious.  I highly recommend leaving room for dessert and having one of these.  Once again the service was a little slow, had to ask for drink refills and settings for the table, etc.  No, not the end of the world, but the service could have been better.   They do offer the ""call ahead"" service so they can save a table for you, which is nice.   All in all, the food is great.  If you are going to BJ's, go for the food, not the service.   The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars was the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=880

S T.,"San Leandro, CA",2,164,9,1.0,1/18/2011,"I was very very displeased with this place. I have been to other BJ's restaurants throughout California, and this is by far the worst one I have been to. I came here to celebrate my 21st birthday with my family, and it was the absolute worst experience. I was looking forward to a fun night out, but instead, I was disappointed.  We called a week in advance to let them know we would be having a large party of 20 people. They seemed to be accommodating over the phone, but it was an entirely different experience when we got there. Our reservations were at 6pm and I showed up at 530pm since we brought a cake and wanted to be at the restaurant prior to our guests. We were told we could not be seated until half of our party arrived. Ok, no problem...so we sat at the bar. Service sucked at the bar! Then the manager informs my mom and I that we are sitting OUTSIDE!! Outside in January...i think not. He said that all large parties have to be seated outside which was a complete LIE since there was a large party of 50 seated down the center of the restaurant. Really?? Ridiculous. He said if we wanted to sit inside, we would have to wait an additional hour and a half.  The outside ended up being semi-closed off with heating lamps but we were still cold and we could smell all the cigarette smoke from the smokers outside which made my guests who were pregnant to be extremely uncomfortable. As we get outside, they were seating us at SEPARATE tables!? WHAT!? By this point, i was extremely upset and wanted everyone to sit together. My mom, NOT the workers, had to put tables together and go inside to get silverware for everyone. Excuse me, am I paying my mom or the restaurant. Granted, we did have a lot of people so service wasnt going to be quick. But we only had one waiter for all of us and it took forever to get drinks and order our food. They should have brought in one additional person to help out. I did feel bad since the waiter was working his butt off to help and I was thankful for that.  However, when I got my pizza that I was sharing with my dad, we were not giving any plates. My guests didnt receive plates for their food either! Then it took 10-15 min just to get plates and some of them were DIRTY! Later on, a random server brought a pazooki to my table for me to have for my birthday, but I was still in the bathroom. By the time I returned, the ice cream was completely melted and I had melted wax all over my dessert. That went into the trash...Even though the food was good, I was very displeased about everything in general.  The manager gave my mom a gift card to return, but I moved out of town and will not be returning...so I did not benefit from this experience whatsoever. For being a restaurant that brings in a lot of customers, it is not large enough. Plus, they should have told us over the phone prior to me coming out there that we would be seated outside.

Erika B.,"Hayward, CA",1,2,,1.0,5/26/2012,"this is not the first time i have been to this particular BJ's, but this experience was absolutely AWFUL.  I wish i could give ZERO stars for the service.  Here is why.... We arrived at 7pm for a party of 8 and used their call ahead service to put our name on the list before we arrived.  Once we arrived and checked in, they told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait.  An hour later, our buzzer goes off and we go to get seated.  They take us straight to a table outside--but never asked if we had a preference and just assumed we would be okay with it.  We were not.  There were people smoking outside near the patio area and it was pretty chilly.  We were then taken back inside and told we would be put back on the top of the list for the next available table inside that could seat 8 people.  They didn't give us an estimated time of how much longer it would be, but just told us they have been waiting for another table to leave who had been there for almost 2 hours.  FINALLY, we were seated...inside--almost 2 HOURS since our arrival.  There were no free appetizers given, barely an apology--instead they just blamed it on the other table taking 2 hours before freeing up a table for us.  Once we got to the table, our service from our server wasn't the best either.  He took a while to get us waters, and once he brought them, he didn't even bring enough for the whole table.  We finally ordered our food, they forgot a salad that was ordered and it just took forever to get anything accomplished.   In addition, there was a large spill right next to our table and it seemed as though we were more worried about getting someone to clean it up, than the management was.  We put down a napkin on the spill, so no one would slip and eventually someone came to clean it up. We were at BJ's for a total of 3.5 hours for dinner.  Absolutely RIDICULOUS for a Friday night dinner.  The food was delicious, but the service made the experience, less than appealing.

We were told this chicken dish was sold out, so my friend opted for the the country fried steak dinner. I ordered a shrimp pasta, but the angel hair noodles were out so I had to sub my noodles. Which was ok, we were hungry. Anyways, the wait for our food = about 45minutes. And my pasta came out luke warm. Not kool!!!  We were informed by the manager like 40 minutes into the wait that there was a reason for the wait. The CFS was just freshly breaded and fried. I asked to have my pasta warmed up. Only good thing was free desert.  Still I really love the food, when its hot.  The opened sandwiches are A+. Always wanted to try the pizza. But really the Country Fried Steak is pretty awesome with the thick gravy and some hot sauce. Always wanted to try the pizza, maybe next time. Yes there will be a next time for me even if service it needs a little work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=900
Steve P.,"Concord, CA",0,13,3,1.0,7/5/2011,"My son and I went there because it was the only place open in the mall two hours before fireworks started at College Park. The hostess was nice and pretty and sat us two right away. Our server Andrew was pleasant and immediately asked if we wanted a house soda or ale. We opted for a root beer and cherry soda. I also ordered the seared ahi as an appetizer. The house sodas are served with no ice - I suppose because they are so yummy. However the mug was very warm from the dishwasher and the soda was super sweet. The root beer was strong but good, but the cherry soda was strong and just bad. I asked for ice and Andrew brought us a glass, half way attempt to add ice to our drinks, then gave up, mumbled something and left me to spoon ice into our drinks. After adding ice, the drinks were okay, but could have been more watered down for my taste. The ahi came and was alright. I had wonderful seared ahi at Outback a couple of weeks prior, and it was much better. When the ahi came I had to ask for utensils... because we had none - you'd think the server might have noticed that by then, maybe checked when the ahi was dropped off, but no. I ordered the chicken parmesan off the lunch menu and the boy got the classic bacon burger - both mistakes. The chicken I got was the worst I've ever had. It was hard and dry and the cheese was gross. There was no sauce, but it was served with spaghetti. The spag was overly spicy, but was the best part of my meal. As another reviewer mentioned, the burger is served on a roll, not a bun. The bun was gross and severely burned. The bacon was nasty on top of that burger. My son usually wolfs down a good burger. He stopped before half way and told me it tasted funny - the kiss of death for a ten year old. So I tasted it and he was right - gross. I tried a few of his fries and they were absolutely gobbed in some spicy stuff. I wanted to be in a good mood for the fourth, so I paid my bill and left, never to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=900

But the 2nd time I went, not only did the server forget about our table, by the time he remembered us and brought us our very cold food, he tried to lie to us and tell us that they just came out and that it was a busy night, little did he know we were paying attention to all the other tables around us and they were getting their food before we were even though they sat down 10-15 min after us.

It was really tasty and perfectly cooked. It's a hamburger patty on sourdough bread with cheese, avocado and green chiles. It came with some crispy shoestring french fries that were really good. To drink, I had a Pumpkin Ale and a Jeremiah Red. The Pumpkin Ale (their current seasonal beer) was tasty, kind of like banana bread mixed with pale ale. Jeremiah Red has been one of my favorite BJ's brews for a long time so of course that was good too. Service is really good.

Our usual order: *Appetizer - mozzarella sticks:  I could just order a few plates of these and make a meal of it.   *The wife - fish & chips:  Some of the best around.  Most places rarely get it right, but they nail it every time and their fish is very high quality.  *Myself - roast beef dip sandwich (au jus):  Consistently the best french dip I have ever had.   Other things we've ordered: *Pizza - Yea so i guess this is what they're known for.  It was pretty good but still - It's just pizza, not like it's Zachary's or anything... *Pizookie - My wife enjoyed this dessert.  I was a bit bored with it. *New York steak - oh this one was BAD.  it was just a flavorless chunk of meatiness.  Blah.  So disappointing. The Experience: *The Dining Room -   Expect it to be loud - loud music, TVs, and loud wasted party goers abound.  Expect a very long wait for a table, unless you feel like eating on the patio.  The servers are always great though, once you actually get seated. *Take out - We just tried their ""curbside"" service last night.  It was a complete joke. I called in our order and was told it would be 20-25 minutes.  I show up 25 minutes later to find an abandoned take out counter.  After a few minutes a girl shows up at the counter and confirms my order.  She says everything is ready and she just has to go in the back to get it and disappears.  She didn't come back for over 15 minutes!!  Eventually a hostess offers me a complimentary drink and later had to page the girl that was getting my food.  It was ridiculous!  In all I had to wait for over 20 minutes from the time they told me to show up to pick up the food.  We thought maybe the food wasn't ready when i showed up and the girl was just lying about it, but the mozzarella sticks and crispy thin fries were totally rubbery like they'd been sitting for a LONG time.  I don't know that we'll do the take out thing here any more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=900

I was with my wife and good friend with beer at the table and awaiting the arrival of an amazing burger. After a reasonable amount of time, I was served some irrelevant sandwich- the same kind your weird Italian roommate would make in between football and a bizarre laundry ritual. I was not too disappointed at this point, and after some contemplation decided to send it back to get the real burger that I desired. After watching the people who I love enjoy their meals, my burger arrived. This time the meat was not thoroughly cooked as the pink was so bright it was as if they were mocking me. I felt so badly for sending it back a second time, because usually I just take what I'm given even with mistakes. It was simply not edible- I did not go there to enjoy raw meat. The manager came to the table to apologize, and she seemed sincere but I feel it was façade. I understand that being a manager of a restaurant and brewery is demanding, and I would feel the same. After all it wasn't her fault. But to express my experience at this restaurant, it was not worth what we paid, and to make multiple mistakes on one order is simply not acceptable. When it comes down to it, the Wendys in Fremont is so much more superior. Their Frosty's are impeccable, and the burgers are amazingly delicious without being overpriced.

She apologized and took our order as well.  Did not write anything down. Server FINALLY stopped by and apologized for the wait too.  After waiting about a half hour, the same manager walked by and said our meal was ""coming right up."" 15 minutes later, they brought it out. One of the meals was completely wrong (not what was ordered) and they had to remake it, which took - no kidding - another 30 minutes.  A different manager brought out the corrected meal and said they wouldn't charge us for that meal.  I explained what had happened and from that point on, our waitress was rude.  I didn't bag on her at all, I just explained what happened during our visit.  Before we ever received our meal, the other table that came in AFTER us had FINISHED their meals and already left!   We should have left when we were ignored for so long and taken it as a sign of things to come.  BJ's, we'll be checking out different mall options going forward!  And as a side note - not a good idea for servers to wear heavy scents - the perfume was overwhelming!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=820

This guy took our drink order and our waiter was at our table a couple of minutes later with our drinks and ready to take our order. He checked on us throughout the meal and brought the check out promptly. We don't eat BJ's pizza often because it's not exactly healthy, but it is always a great treat when we do get it!

Heidi T.,"Sacramento, CA",1,25,,3.0,6/12/2010,"I def wouldn't try to come here around dinner time, especially on a weekend. It seems to be the only hot spot in Concord where everyone migrates to after 6pm.  For lunch I would recommend BJ's. I love their deep dish pizza. I've tried their specialty pizzas and they're great and so is their simple peperoni pizza. Great crust!  However, the staff does need some work. One waitress was about to end her shift and she would not stop buggin every 5-10 minutes. She was so anxious on leaving and giving us our check and we hardly received our plates. She needed to chill out or have someone else tend our table bc she became so annoying. I understand you are in a hurry to leave but do not rush me! Another time late on a Friday night, there were two groups of people arguing. One girl took off her heels and you know somethings going to happen after that. They were, no doubt, causing a scene but not one manager or staff member did anything. This wouldn't have pissed me off as much if the girls hadn't picked up glasses and start throwing them. Of course, we would be right behind one of the girls who threw a pepper shaker so then a glass was thrown across the room back in our direction with inaccurate aim and hit someone at our table. REALLY? As if this couldn't have been prevented if the commotion was taken out of the restaurant at the time it started. Bad experience.

Alex M.,"Berkeley, CA",2,30,3,2.0,11/16/2009,"Went to BJ's tonight, after being very excited about the new location opening up here.  I had eaten at BJ's in LA, and I remember it being really good. Well, this time it wasn't really good.  We went on a weeknight, so seating or wait times weren't a problem at all.  But maybe that messed up their timing, because our food came all at once.  So the salads hit the table, and the pizza came about ten seconds later.  Another problem with timing was that when the server took my card at the end, she kept it for like ten minutes.  If I have any bogus charges I know right where to go.  Actually, they changed servers on us halfway through.  The first gal came by every ten seconds to ask it we had saved room for a Pizookie, and the second was kind of distant.  The service was pretty much whatever. The food was pretty much in the same boat.  The salads were actually bad.  I had the Caesar, and the lettuce came with a bunch of wilted pieces included.  Also, Caesar is supposed to be made with romaine hearts, and this was mainly the tips of the leaves, so it was kind of tough and dry.  My friend had the house salad, which wasn't much better.  I had the house amber ale, and it was not very good at all.  Almost a weird chemical taste.  I didn't finish it. Ok, the pizza was actually really good, which it should be because it's their signature thing.  No complaints here.  Hot.  Nice chewy dough, crispy crust.  Tasty and satisfying. In summation, you can tell walking in that they basically hire a bunch of 19 year olds, and the dining experience really shows it.  Nothing was polished, nothing was truly professional.  One more quick example.  My friend asked for water, and the dude only brought one.  Pretty standard I think, that they should think to bring one for each diner.  Its the little things.   They have a great service where you can call ahead for a pie, park in these two special spaces out front, call em again, and they will walk the pizza out to you.  I would recommend this, because while the pizza is good, the restaurant sucks.  Get it to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=940

Followed by a fried calamari appetizer which I really enjoyed. The batter was real good, and the two sauces served with it were pretty good. For my main course I had the fish tacos. The halibut was fried to perfection which was a surprise since most of the chain restaurants overfry and destroy everything that they touch.

Angie E.,"Livermore, CA",510,44,5,1.0,8/19/2010,"First I will say that I've had dinner at other BJ's locations (and love their food and usually get pretty good service at other locations) so this is strictly my opinion on this Concord location only. It's a Wednesday evening and we had a group of 7 ladies.   Parking at this location is a bear because it shares the same lot as a 24 Hour Fitness. Our car load of 4 circled 4 times up and down and finally just settle parking around the corner taking a little bit of a walk. Remember, it's a WEDNESDAY!!!  We get there and they said that it was going to be less than an hour wait...I've NEVER had anyone tell me that at the other locations when I eat mid week. We had put our name in at 627pm. We're standing outside and their entire patio area is pretty much empty with the exception of 1 couple.  Didn't think anything of it at the time and since there was 7 of us we just had good conversation while waiting.  We checked with the front twice on our status and they kept saying that there were 2-3 parties in front of us...well what is it, two OR three? how do you not know?   FINALLY at 737pm we got seated...the gal asked us if the patio was ok.  we said yes (cause we're starving at this point). we get seated out in the patio and so did two other tables of two. We were greeted by a hot waiter which seemed to make the waiting we had done a little less painful.  he asked us for our drink orders and brought them back to us.  Then he took food orders and we ordered apps (potato skins 2 orders) and the rest of our food, nothing was weird or special about our orders, just ordered straight from the menu.  The only thing they get 1 star for is having a nice, hot waiter and the fact that our potato skins came out right away and the fact that I can't give no stars or negative...i wish i could. we finished our potato skins and then a group of 14 ladies were seated next to us.  the two couples near us had already gotten their food they ordered.  still no food for us.  waiting and waiting and waiting...finally a couple of dishes came out at 835pm.  waited and waited and waited...nothing else.  hmmm so we waited and waited and waited some more.  a couple more dished trickled out at 845pm.  got a manager involved.  she apologized and said that she'd give us 50% off the entire bill.  we were still waiting for one more dish.  waited and waited and waited. by this time we had to get some of us home and so we said to give us boxes.  the entire wait staff in the restaurant knew we were LEAVING....and what do they do, they bring the last dish on a plate when they had helped box the other stuff up.  it was almost 9pm when that last dish came out....so they took it to get it boxed...15 mins passed, i was pissed. so i went to find the manager again...but the manager was apparently busy putting out other customer complaint fires (that's a red flag)...waited and waited and waited and FINALLY the last dish came. Opened the box to look at it and it seriously looked like someone threw up on my pizza.  the toppings were everywhere and the crust was completely limp and soggy like it had been sitting there for 15 mins in the box before they decided to bring it out. so i took the pizza in to show the girl at the front.  she took it to the manager and he came out 5 mins later.  I said we're not paying for our bill period cause this evening has been absolutely unacceptable.  he said he completely understood and that there were no words or excuses he would give me and he'd happily take care of the bill.  the bill was for $120...too bad we didn't have drinks...that would have been better. so i ended up going to burger king on my way home and had a whopper jr for dinner at 10pm since my stomach was growling louder than my radio at this point.   bottom line, never going back to the concord location ever again...not that i'm ever out there much anyway, we were just trying to accomodate a friend that lives out that way.  and i suggest you don't go there either...one of the gals posted our adventure on FB and all of her friends were commenting on how they never go to that location because the service/kitchen staff sucks all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=940

Our party of 6 gets there when the doors open at 10. We are the only party there. we sit down. our waitress with long black hair in 2 braids, takes our drink order (all sodas.) Just from that interaction, I had a bad feeling. She didn't seem all there or to know what she was doing or something. About 10 minutes go by and no one has drinks. A party of 2 has since come in. That's it...our party of 6 and the party of 2 in the entire restaurant. She was no where to be found. She finally comes back. one person ordered a regular soda, the rest are all diet. She stares at the platter of drinks and says ""Oh..usually i put 2 straws in the diet to tell it apart from regular but I guess I didn't, so we'll have to guess."" Then she realizes as she is setting them on the table  that she put 2 straws in the regular. um..??? it's been like 5 minutes since you filled the glasses. She walks away-and SHOCKING-the regular soda is also a diet. REALLY? So 3 of us order from the breakfast menu (2 french toasts and a breakfast pizza) and 3 order from the regular lunch menu. so we wait. Finally 4 of our meals come out. The 3 lunch menu items and one order of french toast. so we all wait to start eating until everyone is served..and we wait...and there is no syrup or butter on the plate or table for the french toast either. Finally our oh so bright waitress shows up with the breakfast pizza and sees us all looking around and says 'whats the problem?"" Um..we still are short a plate and my dad asks for butter and syrup.  ""Oh.."" she says. So she disappears into the kitchen and gets the other french toast. meanwhile-the rest of us have been waiting for all of us to be served, so now ALL of our food is cold. By this time, one other party of 4 is in the restaurant. So 12 customers in the restaurant...and this crappy of service? after she sets the last plate down, she says ""is there STILL a problem?"" My dad said ""I still don't have butter or syrup for my french toast."" She SIGHS and goes back to the kitchen like she is put out. Are you KIDDING? she brings back a syrup and butter for my dad that ordered french toast-but NOTHING for the other person that ordered the same thing. Who eats french toast without syrup and butter? That would just be warm bread! why doesn't it come on the plate instead of asking for it?  By this time, we were all so irritated with the cold food and crappy service, that the person that got NO butter, just gave up and did without. NICE! We are very generous tippers, and I have to say, this was one of the rare times i  didn't even want to leave a standard 20%. Our family Easter brunch was a total wash. we all left shaking our heads. Not sure if i will go back. if i do, and i am seated in her section, I will ask to be moved. And by the way, when we left, there were still only about 20 customers in the whole place. NO reason for the lack of service we received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=960

I always see these restaurants on the Food Network that have these great items that can't be obtained anywhere else except for that restaurant. Well I've found that thing at BJ's. The Irish Rootbeer is fantastic. It's made with their homemade rootbeer and it will give you a nice buzz. I've been to BJ's 3 times in the past 3 months. It is quickly becoming my favorite ""go-to"" spot when I want pretty good food with lots of options. My only complaint is that on Friday & Saturday nights you get the bar & club crowd which can be a little irritating.

We have gone 3 times since they opened at this location and find the waiters/waitress were great, very friendly. However, we may stop going there because of a recent debacle with the restaurant manager. I caution you in advance if you plan to make reservations for large parties. We asked 3 times and 3 different hostess instructed us to call 24 hours in advance to make the reservations, however the manager argued with my wife that she could have made it days earlier. The afternoon manager on Jan.29th was a complete asshole. He needs to try to accommodate his patrons, but instead he was argumentative and rash on the phone. If I was there in person, I would like to see him talk to my wife or I like that. We are boycotting going there until he is removed from his position. We love going there, but do not respect the way management treats their customers. We are still waiting for his call back, his name was Mike.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=960

Benjina D.,"Frisco, TX",835,188,438,2.0,10/26/2009,"I'd tack on another half star to the two stars I've given, but that's it...tops. I've been to many BJ's Brewpubs, especially in Texas, and I have to say, this one sucked. So they're new, ok, I'll give them a break for not having their waitstaff together. But having bad food is no excuse, especially since what they serve is standard fare that is served in all BJ's restaurants nationwide.  Brownie points for being seated on time, after having called ahead to be put on their list. Another star for giving us a booth (there were only 2 of us). I was disappointed at not seeing the chilli cheese fries on the menu. They used to have the thick cut fries, with chilli and cheese on it -- it was the bomb! So, we opted to get the nachos that the waitress recomended. It turns out, that they do offer the thick cut fries, they have the chilli and the cheese, so why the waitress didn't just offer to have the kitchen make them for us was just weird.  Anyway, the chilli cheese nachos weren't done right the first time around. Not enough cheese, it had olives (we asked for no olives), no sour cream, and no salsa on the side. Second round of nachos came, and they looked good enough. One layer of chips into it, we were out of cheese, and there was no chilli to speak of. It was all dry chips. After playing with the plate, and digging into the middle of the stack of chips, I finally found the chilli...all on the bottom of the plate, and stone cold. Wtf? On to the pizza. We ordered a medium with onions and green peppers, well done. The pizza didn't have enough sauce on it. I know, I know, Chicago style has sauce on the top...but trust me, this one did not have enough. And, not enough cheese either. The pizza dough was doughy, and not at all well-done, or crispy. The toppings were falling off the pizza as we lifted the slice. My husband pointed out the dry, sauceless, cheeseless parts of his slice to the waitress, who said, ""oh, you must have gotten a bad slice."" Really? How about the rest of the pizza? Must have gotten an entirely bad pizza, I guess.  She never did offer to do anything about it, and simply walked off.  We also had the Blackened Chicken baked potato, which was ok. The chicken had been re-heated, so it tasted really dry. The alfredo sauce was horrible. Tasted watery, and I wouldn't want it anywhere on a pasta dish, if that's the same sauce they use.  The saving grace was the pizookie. It was awesome! We had a warm peanut butter cookie with chocolate ice-cream...mmmm! Also a plus point: Cowboy games! So, would we come back to this BJ's? Yes, but we'll be sitting at the bar, having a drink, eating a pizookie, and watching the Cowboys play.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=920
Melissa M.,Bay Area,73,126,,2.0,11/3/2009,"I went here last night for happy hour with some friends.  The food was good, but the service sucked.  Our server seemed out of it and made my husband repeat his order to him multiple times.  Seriously, dude.  Freakin' write that ish down already.  I mean, it was a little loud, but if the server actually paid attention to what my husband was saying, he would've gotten the order.  I asked him three times for new place settings, but I never received them.  Luckily, I ordered pizza, so I didn't need a fork, but I still wanted a napkin. I was forced to use beverage napkins that were left on my table.  I know they opened recently, but they really need to work on training their wait staff to do their job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=920

First off the waiter [RODGER] was TERRIBLE. didn't give us refills on water, took forever to give us our food and take the order, never asked how the food was, and the group who arrived 20 minutes after us got their drinks before WE did! The food was good at least. We got less portions than at the other places. specifically the avocado rolls. we got a two topping medium pizza but he charged us for a three topping....?! Plus when we paid we wanted 20 cash and the rest on the card.... he put all of it on the card and just broke the 20 for us.... who hired this guy? Seriously! He spilled our pizza as well and blamed it on us saying we made him nervous.

Jamie D.,"Berkeley, CA",108,5,1,2.0,6/1/2011,"I worked at this location for almost 2 years...since they opened. I finally had to quit because the servers were lazy and the restaurant did not run very efficiently. That is not to say that there are not a few Gems there. Of course, there are about 5 servers who are amazing, and a few menu items that are always popular. I would always recommend the Jambalaya and the Parmesan Chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes, but ask for extra chardonnay butter sauce...trust me. The pizzas I feel are a joke...need to be cooked longer than they are, and not worth the calories you will pack on! The problem with this place is that the menu is so F****ing big, and they add new items every 3 months (good for variety, but bad for server knowledge). They also make the servers go through all of these retarded steps of service, which are suppose to create efficiency, but makes us sound like robots that dont really care. I always ventured away from the steps of service, which low-and-behold made me one of the best servers, and I had a ton of regulars, secret shoppers of course got in the way...I decided it wasnt worth being a drone and quit! So I would recommend Bjs if you are looking for a fun place to kick back and drink some beer and watch a game in the bar, f the dinning room, and be really friendly to your server...trust me they get enough bs from the manager there! Good luck!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=920
C B.,"Clayton, CA",0,63,,2.0,6/14/2014,Super slow for a Thursday! We came in to celebrate the last day of school & I think half of Pleasant Hill had the same idea along with those who wanted to watch the soccer game in Brazil. We arrived at 1:00. Our server was horrible!! After we were seated he took forever to get our drink orders & we were hungry & ordered an appetizer. After about 20 minutes he comes back to take our orders. Mom & daughter split a pizza & mom wanted a house salad to go with it. Her salad comes out BEFORE the appetizer & it is the saddest salad I've ever seen. It had 4 pieces of lettuce drenched in ranch dressing. It was a disgrace to call it a salad. The BBQ chicken on the pizza was DRY. My daughter picked it off because she couldn't eat it. Chicken tacos on the other hand were great. Our server never brought us our food someone else always did. The only thing he did do was refill drinks when we asked. A good server should be on top of the drink situation. After we ate we decide we need to eat a pizookie!

The caramelized onion was asked for on the side and it never made it to the plate at all!  The fish and chips were overcooked, almost burnt, and the fish (must have been pollack) had no flavor and was dry; the wedge fries were very good.  The server constantly tried to ""upsell"" us from appetizers and drinks to dessert.  First we were told cutlery would be brought, then we asked for it and finally when we were served, they still hadn't brought anything.  The server did offer a complimentary pizza-cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a candle which was very nice of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=920

Then I have had a few servers who were really good and some not very good at there jobs. I payed close attention to the bartenders lately and they are SO BAD AS BARTENDERS!!!!!!! I don't know if that is the way they are trained but WOW! They seem to be clueless on the most basic cocktails and then I saw a few of them making a drink that requires shaking and they don't add ice and barely even shake the drink. Plus they move slow and don't seem to have any confidence as bartenders. The beer itself has been inconsistent lately as well. There are times when lets say the Nutty Brunette is really good and then other times taste like dirty gym socks. I was able to try the sodas the other day and they are all good except for the cherry cola. And they are always out of the cream soda which is the best. This place is great but they need a lot of work and help to improve themselves.

After a few minutes, the waiter took our drink order, then came back and took our food order and then we waited...and waited......and waited some more....then finally got our drinks nearly 15 minutes after we ordered them (I had to ask the waiter if remembered). Then within five minutes, the worst scenario in eating out unfolded before our eyes....the near same time delivery of the appetizer and entree. Literally 3 minutes apart, no one at the table had even finished their salads yet before pizzas starting showing up on our table.

Granted they only opened a month ago, the workers can't seem to get it together there. They all look puzzled. The place is WAY to small for a BJ's. The location in Vacaville is way bigger and better. Concord's only has one section for large parties so good luck on weekends if you have a large party. (we had a party of 8 and it took us 2 hours to be seated) When we finally got seated we had 2 different people wait on us (which I knew was bad news from the start) sure enough our order got all screwed up. One pizza came out before anything else so 2 people from our party were done eating before others even got their food. THEN to top of a wonderful evening we waited 45 mins for them to get our check right... they had to have the MANAGER come out and do the check cause the workers didn't know what they were doing with the computer i guess... Granted we did get 3 free pazookie desserts and $30 bucks in gift cards for the inconvenience.. all in all horrible restaurant expeirence, good food, great beer as always BUT!! if u have large parties (and 8's not even large) go to another location until this location can get the act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=980

Chrissy O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",40,56,14,1.0,8/12/2015,"Went to bjs for a quick bite and a pitcher of beer. Sat in the bar area, got a seat right away. It was just me and my sister. We ordered a pitcher of beer and waters right off the bat. 15 minutes had gone by and we hadn't even seen our waiter. When we finally found him, he said the bartender had ""cut her hand or something"", and that's why it was taking so long. Another 10 minutes goes by. We finally get our pitcher after almost 30 min, ordered food, and waters (again).  Food came quick and was good. We asked for napkins and forks, twice. Which never came. Our waiter (Salvador) seemed to busy flirting with some waitress at the bar then tending to his tables. The one directly behind was also complaining about their service. We finally flagged down a different waiter to talk to the manager. Before the manager came out waiter finally came out from wherever he was hiding and we asked again for silver wear and waters. By now our food was getting cold (calamari and Brussel sprouts...two things not good when cold) so we used our fingers. Boy that was pretty gross as the food was super greasy. Beer had been gone for awhile. The manager came out and listened to what we had to say and said he would take some stuff off our bill, but NEVER even apologized. Our waiter was MIA for another 20 min, and when he returned he didn't even ask if we wanted refills. We AGAIN asked for water and napkins. Finally got napkins, NO WATER. The manager took half off our food. We had to of course find the waiter and ask for our check. Another 15 min go by, and we have to find the waiter to even take out payment.

Ivy R.,"Martinez, CA",137,1779,4674,4.0,3/25/2010,"Its been a long time since my husband and I went out on a Sunday for our regular lunch dates. We were shopping for beds at Sears and I said what the hell.  Lets go try the cocktails over at BJ's. (We didn't drink last time) There are two mitigating factors to the one star bump.  Their amazing cocktail menu and they have the calories listed in the back for almost all of their menu items. Now to the drinks.  I started with a Pina Chococolada Martini.  Number one weirdest combination drink I have ever had and it is extremely good.   ""A decadent, creamy blend of Malibu coconut rum, Midori Melon Liqueur, Monin White Peach, pineapple juice and whipped cream, topped off with a chocolate swirl.""  Its Delicious. Second drink was the BJ's Irish Root Beer.  If you thought Root Beer couldn't get any better, well sister it just did.  ""Root Beer for grown-ups! Made with JAMESON Irish Whiskey, BAILEYS Irish Cream, BOLS Butterscotch Schnapps, and BJ's handcrafted root beer. You can't drink just one.""  I only drank one but I wanted other things on the menu. In between those two drinks we split a House Salad and a Grilled Chicken Pesto Pizza.  The salad was good.  Just a regular salad. The Pizza was very good.  Its actually the perfect size to split.  Each piece is 93 calories.  Between the two of us we had 3 1/2 slices.  It was a nice lunch and reasonably priced. For the last drink of the day I went with the Strawberry Confusion, Hpnotiq Liqueur, Stoli Razberi Vodka, pineapple juice and a splash of strawberry served chilled and straight up. It was very fresh like a thinner strawberry smoothie served in a Martini glass.  I really liked it.  Its a great summer cocktail. The service was great.  Kind of slow but it was really, really busy in there.  I'm just really appreciative of their outstanding cocktail menu.  I will be back more often now because of that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=360

Took the family for dinner the night before Thanksgiving and was surprised that 3 of the 4 of us ended up with a seafood dish. Two out of the three (sirloin/lobster tail combo, clam chowder) were decent or above average. The third was the Mahi Mahi and while I knew it was pan seared, it came out very dry. The manager did a great job handling a return and recommending a jalapeno burger so she gets props for her service. I was surprised that I didnt even get a ""sorry, we messed up, here's a free beer"" offer but I guess that's the way it is in today's economy. The beers were good as usual. The waiter was hilarious and helped make an enjoyable evening of it. Tried the Call Ahead Service to get our name on ""the list"". The person answering the phone said they were not busy and there would be no issue so we said, we'll be there in 40 minutes. We arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule and waited 15 minutes for a table. While it was probably better than the 20 other people waiting, I'm not sure what the real bonus of ""call ahead"" is.

Amy R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,25,1,2.0,12/16/2015,"Overpriced and Uninspired. 1 - The mac 'n cheese came from a box. I am not kidding: tiny noodles, neon orange. The meal cost pennies per serving, and it's a bad business decision for any self-respecting restaurant. I have no complaint with boxed mac 'n cheese when I'm lazy at home, but no one who cares about food serves boxed Macaroni and Cheese to paying customers. 2 - My hamburger cost $11.25, before tax. $11.25! It was meh: not bad, but definitely not good. For $11, I expect my bacon cheeseburger to be dripping in some crack-based delicious sauce, possibly BBQ, with thick applewood bacon slices, onions - grilled or rings, and sharp cheddar dripping over a half pound grass-fed Angus burger on a fancy bun. No!!! At BJ's an $11 burger is rather pathetic: a smallish patty on a plain bun - no sauce, paper thin bacon, a slice of raw red onion, and the cheese was placed as an afterthought in that weird not melted but lukewarm sweaty stage just sitting on the burger.  3 - Shoestring French fries were so unhealthy and fried so many times they would've been decadent if they had arrived hot or at least warm. 4 - The ""healthy"" grilled chicken was so salty my kid wouldn't eat it.  5 - For a ""brewery"" BJ's offers no local, unique, or interesting beers. 6 - Everything was soo expensive it made the mediocrity insulting. It would be one star except:  - The service was nice. Staff were inexperienced, but trying.  - The cookies and cream pookie! Still over-priced, but soo delicious.

Gabriel D.,"Hercules, CA",173,133,741,2.0,4/1/2014,"It's not often that I give a place a bad review.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. Time is valuable, and this establishment really wasted my sister's and my time. If the food wasn't good, I'd probably never go back.  Unfortunately the food here is good enough to come back for. Now for the story. It's Friday, March 28, 2014. I just got home from work and my parents went to Cache Creek for the night so I brought my sister to BJ's (we were contemplating on where to eat for over 30 minutes until finally she decided BJ's). Before arriving my sister called to reserve a table for 2. So once we got there we checked in and they said we were next on the list. We waited for 5 minutes or so and were finally seated. After looking at the menu, we decided to order from their new ""Enlighted Entrees"" section (well new since the last time I was there). So then at ~9:00pm we ordered: Drinks: root beer and water Appetizer: Calamari 2 dinner plates:  Mahi-Mahi Tacos (chargrilled mahi-mahi with chipotle mayonnaise and tossed in Santa Fe dressing, Napa cabbage, carrots, red onions and cilantro. With avocado cream sauce, fire-roasted tomato salsa and tortilla chips.) Lemon Thyme Chicken (Herb-roasted chicken breast served over brown rice, topped with sautéed red onions, tomatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce.) After 5 minutes the calamari comes out pretty fast, so we eat that while waiting for our main courses. And the waiting commences. My sister and I talk about college, since my sister's a junior in high school right now and I just recently graduated from college, we talked about SATs and grades and which colleges she should apply. We already finished the calamari, and the time is now 9:45pm. My sister and I are wondering what's taking our food so long. So when the waitress walks by, my sister asks, ""Do you think you can check on our food?"" in which she replies, ""Yeah..it shouldn't be taking this long, let me go check."" 9:51pm, our waitress does a squat so that we're all on eye level, and tells us, ""I'm really sorry about this, but they lost your ticket in the back. They don't know what's going on back there. I'm really sorry about this. I told them to cook them as fast as they can."" My sister and I are just like :| at this point. It's almost 10:00pm already, it's kind of late for dinner, and we're not as hungry anymore because we had calamari.. Then our waitress offers us free salad, in which my sister and I happily accept. So we received 2 'Fresh Mozzarella and tomato Salads"" that were pretty good. Then just 15 minutes later, both of our orders came in. My sister and I ate half of each, and they were both really good. Under 800 calories per plate, yet packed full of flavor. The food being good is why this experience doesn't get 1 star (as well as the 4 refills of root beer I had which made me pretty full). Our waitress apologized again as she gave us our bill, and my sister and I said np. We know it's not her fault for the mistake they made in the back. I just wish she could have been more attentive of it though instead of us having to ask her to check on our food. Probably coming back here again eventually...but I just hope that we have a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-concord?start=360
