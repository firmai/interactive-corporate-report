7,Debra M.,"Broomfield, CO",0,1,,2.0,2013-05-25,My husband and I took his parents who live in Topeka to this Applebee's last night when we arrived for a visit.  It's a regular dining place for them and I was shocked and disappointed when we had to request they remake two of our over $10. salads with fresh lettuce since what they served was orange-tinted on the edges.  I was embarrassed to have to also ask for a clean knife after discovering the one I had was dirty.  I was glad the manager delivered our remade salads which indicates he was made aware of the problem.  It was surprising our bill wasn't adjusted to reflect their intent toward good customer service.  We will choose differently next time and hope for an improvement for the sake of the local seniors who frequent this Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3?start=20,1.544,1.544,1.544,1.544,1.544
3,Robert H.,"Topeka, KS",48,108,43.0,1.0,2014-02-10,"Well I take back all the kind things I said about this place. They are on the list of dirtiest restaurants in Topeka, with four critical violations coming the SAME WEEK I was visiting raving about how good this place could be. Let's be clear. Every time I've come here is been terrible, minus one time. This place can close already and I could not care any less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3?start=20,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001
26,Lab L.,"Topeka, KS",0,217,,1.0,2014-03-14,"Somehow I found myself at Applebee's in Topeka again at the request of a friend. This is going to be my absolute last visit ever.  I will give up my ""girl dates"" with my college friend if I have to go to this place again. The food tasted great....but once again, the servers are less than inspired.  In fact, our server acted like he was numb.  I also noticed a high number of servers always standing around their check-in point talking or at the end of the bar.  When I came out of the ladies' room, there were 7 servers talking around the bar. The food tasted OK...but came out looking disgusting.  See that picture of my puppy?  She was sick last Saturday...and forgive me....but what came out of her mouth that day was identical to the sauce on the Margarita Chicken dish! And once again.....the dish looked like nothing on the menu.  The wedge salad, on the other hand, was appetizing coming out but didn't taste that inspired. Seriously Topeka!  This is a good franchise and you ruin it for us here in NE Kansas.  I'll visit Applebee's in another cities, but never, ever, ever again in Topeka.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001

5,Eddie V.,"Hammond, LA",7,55,49.0,1.0,2014-07-17,"I previously gave this location of applebees a rather generous review, due to their, overall, good wings. However, i feel like it may be important for me to share a little about some of the other experiences ive had...all of which involved the bar. First off, the bar is horribly managed, as only one bar tender is making drinks for the entire restaurant. Second the bartender is a bitch...and her male assistant once poured me a single when i asked (and payed for) a double, THEN lied to me when i asked if it was a double. Everytime i sit at the bar, the service is shitty. I wait longer, my food arrives colder, my drink gets refilled less often and i have to witness the bartender disappear for five minutes at a time, speak rudely to her fellow employees, and act like shes, quite frankly, too good to be there, and too important to be serving your ass! Not to mention, i dont care for staring at an ass clad in too tight yoga pants during my meal. Its not professional. I guess i keep going back to the bar because of the free chips and salsa...however, after falling for the chips-and-salsa-trap one last time tonight, ive decided that no amount of free filler food makes up for how much i cringe every time i realize im, once again, being served by that bitch-ass bar tender.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3?start=20,,,,,
1,Matt W.,"Holton, KS",124,6,2.0,1.0,2014-11-09,"Went to Applebee's with my wife and 2 children. Seated quickly, and were greated by our server promptly... Then it went down hill. We were asked if we were ready to order 3 times in 5 minutes all while being distracted by the manager who was in awe of our newborn. Then food took forever, the portions were small and burnt. Silverware wasn't given and had to be asked for. Food had its bright spots but overall was poor for all of us. Can't believe we paid $40 for that crap. Oh well live and learn. But wish I would have looked at these reviews before going. Could have saved my family from the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3?start=20,,,,,

21,E P.,"Topeka, KS",2,57,,3.0,2015-01-15,"Girl's Night Out at Applebee's started off as a pleasant evening. A group of women get together once a month at various restaurants in Topeka, Kansas. Tonight, we selected Applebee's as a first for our group because we have never dined here before. I ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken and blackened shrimp, plus a side salad. This was brought on a sizzling platter and included fried red potatoes and sautéed onions & mushrooms. Very tasty. Also ordered by another group member was the 7 oz sirloin with the fried red potatoes and a side salad, which was also described as very good.  The restaurant was busy when we arrived at 6:00 pm, and fortunately, we were seated right away. It stayed busy even at 8:30 pm when we left. Service is prompt and attentive to our needs, replenishing our beverages and checking on our satisfaction with the order.  My only criticism is the singing of the Happy Birthday song to neighboring diners. A very loud young waiter roared above our conversations that we must all stop and pay heed to the singing of the song. He yelled it loud enough for the entire restaurant full of patrons to cease their enjoyment of their companions. This happened twice. The singing was much louder than necessary. Conversation had to stop because you couldn't hear anything other than this irritating group of waiters. Our group found this very rude. We enjoy each others' company and have lots of news to catch up on during our Night Out. Although the food was good, we probably will not dine here again just because of that experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3,,,,,

18,Rose L.,"Overland Park, KS",142,596,162.0,1.0,2015-09-24,"RG and I should switch places.  I went in with a large group, looked around and saw gads of empty tables, and said, ""We are fine with being split up into several groups.""  Instead, they insisted on seating us all ""together"" on one side of the restaurant with one server (for 30 people) after we waited for 20+ minutes while they cleared off tables in the section.  We went in at 9:30 and left at midnight when we finally tabbed out the last four checks (they would only do one table at a time.)  After being adamant about which ticket went with which card (mine was wrapped and folded around the correct card) ""the manager"" swiped the wrong card so I ended up paying for three people instead of one.  I had 26 kids on a bus who had to get up in six hours, and Lord knows it would have taken another 15 or 20 minutes to reverse the charges, so I sucked it up.   Horrible experience that ruined the weekend for us.   Sadly, it's Topeka, and very few places are open past 9 pm, even on a Friday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3,,,,,

22,Josh S.,"Milwaukee, WI",50,2,,1.0,2016-04-14,"Why do I still think it is a good idea to frequent Applebee's when traveling.  Thought I'd pop in for a late night snack. Sat at the bar and was greeted not only by an Y enthused bartender but a awful smell protruding from behind the bar, rotten old sneaker will suffice.  Moved over to a high top where I could get out of the fog!  Boneless wings were terrible all breading, no meat must of been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour because they looked like shriveled raisins, my ceasar was made without being tossed, and consisted of a mound of dressing and cheese with a few pieces of romaine under.  Management has no clue what good service or a dining experience is, tired of shitty chain restaurants just like this one.  Hopefully I will have learned my lesson after this visit",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3,,,,,

11,La Juania M.,"Henrico, VA",102,127,189.0,3.0,2016-11-25,So what can I say ... I will start with the positive: they were open on thanksgiving. With that being said why didn't they plan on being busy. You are the only restaurant in the area that is open! The kitchen was backed up which caused use to wait forever to be seated and to get our food. We even waited like forever for a drink and didn't get an apology or anything.  So the reason really for the 3 stars is I really like the sauce for the wings we had.

I knew Applebee's sucked, but I figured it's just a dollar; how can you go wrong? They went wrong.  The workers had obviously been trained to upsell customers on the margs--two of them said verbatim ""You should get the $3.50 one because it has more tequila,"" but I wanted to try the $1 because that was the special. My date bought the larger one for $3.50.  Neither of them had any tequila in them whatsoever. They were literally straight margarita mix and were so sweet I would have vomited if it wasn't for buying a $5 tequila shot and pouring that in the drink myself.  You're better off buying lime-o-ritas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
9,Scott F.,"Topeka, KS",0,4,,2.0,2017-11-09,"Had a disappointing experience with Applebee's last night. Busy day so thought I would try their ""car side to go"" for takeout. The online ordering was fairly straightforward and gave me a time to arrive. I pulled in a couple of minutes early and, seeing the lot was only about half full, expected quick service but that didn't happen.  When I parked I one of the designated CSTG slots I saw a female employee look directly at me, not once but twice as if she was confirming I was there for takeout. Great, I thought, she'll pop right out and get me started on paying for my food.  Nope, she stood there gabbing with another employee for a few minutes. She finally disappeared ended came out with my food. She was pleasant enough to deal with took my credit card and came back in a reasonable amount of time.   I had ordered the pretzel sticks with cheese dip for an appetizer or as well as the steak with veggies on the side.  What I found when I got home was pretzels that appeared burnt and a cheese dip that was, to put it mildly, terrible.  The taste was off, not spoiled exactly, just off.  My steak was cooked properly and was fairly good. However, my side of veggies were overcooked and the garlic mashed potatoes were flavorless. All in all not a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-topeka-3,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
