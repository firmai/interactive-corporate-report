95,Andrew P.,"Rose Hill, KS",0,1,,5.0,2012-07-29,My wife and I's new favorite restaurant in Wichita.   The pizza was amazing as were  the ribs.  The avacado egg rolls were an excellent start to the meal.  The pizookie was probably the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.  You can't go wrong with this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=80,3.156,3.156,3.156,3.156,3.1560000000000006
37,Alexis R.,"Liberty, MO",429,590,695.0,4.0,2012-08-05,"While BJ's just opened about 2 weeks ago, they seem to have ironed out most of the issues that plagued this chain micro-brew in the early weeks.  We went for lunch in the first week and our meal took over an hour with slow service and kitchen staff.  Our order arrived incorrect with regular crust instead of whole wheat on our lunch-pizza specials ($7).  We didn't want to wait another hour so we just took what  we got.   The beers at lunch are $3.50 and while the IPA was quite muddy and lacking the typical crispness, the pale ale was pleasing. Returned for Happy Hour later in the week - 1/2 mini pizzas and -$1 off beers.  Thankfully they allowed us to get the specials in the main dining area.  There was nothing posted about HH only in the bar and we were a  bit confused when our server had to consult the manager to get us the deals in the dining room.  Anyways, it worked out and we enjoyed mini pizzas (usually ~10$) along with $3 dinner salads.  Not a lot of food for the price but the swanky inside, rich wood accents and extensive bar menu are a welcome addition. The Nit Wit wheat was a nice, citrusy, summer beer but my favorite was the Raspberry Cider!  Not too sweet, perfect crisp finish- definitely liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=20,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005
94,Kyle M.,"Wichita, KS",15,68,14.0,3.0,2012-08-05,"The pizza and beer are pretty good but definitely not the best in Wichita, especially for the high prices they charge here.  I think Old Chicago has far better pizza and a great beer selection.  The pizookie is not all that it is cracked up to be, again, Old Chicago has better cookies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=80,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003
102,Jillian B.,"Denver, CO",2,79,48.0,2.0,2012-08-15,"I went for lunch a couple weeks after they opened. What a disaster! We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, and the first table our hostess took us to had just been sat with another party. After arguing with a different hostess, we were taken back up to the front and had to wait another 5 minutes while they cleared a different table. Service was extremely slow. It easily took 10 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered. (And that was just iced tea- not anything from the bar) It took about an hour from the time we sat down until we finished our food. It felt like we were there forever. The pizza I had was tasty, but nothing special. I don't think the food is worth the price. I think I'll be willing to go back in a couple months once their staff is all trained and have things under control.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=100,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007

87,Ryan Z.,"Wichita, KS",12,2,4.0,3.0,2012-09-11,I've been going to BJ's in other cities for several years.  I have been to the Wichita location five times since it has opened.  I love the concept but the Wichita location just doesn't have the food down yet.  Service has been mixed too.  The waitstaff is always friendly yet it is also almost always slow and on two occasions my order has been wrong. I actually prefer Old Chicago's pizza but the atmosphere at BJ's is more polished - and the rest of the food at BJ's is superior to OC.  Other people have remarked about prices - I think their prices are pretty competitive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=80,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001

So I was very very excited for it to open in Wichita right across the street from me (added bonus).   It gets busy since we came in the first month it opened, so make reservations. but hopefully the crowd dies down.  I always order the avocado spring rolls.  They are fried avocado creamyness.  And we always order the pizza.  Usually BJ's cooks theirs until their crust was crispy and the innerds were hot and soft.  But this BJ's made their crust and innerds just plain soft. No crispyness that I long for.  They also didn't put enough tomato sauce.  It was alright, I needed to eat.   I love their cider and their homemade cola. Im not a beer fan so I didn't try out the beer.  I signed up for their membership, because I think i'll be frequenting their establishment  in the future. And i'll have their pizza hopefully it was just that day.

98,Mike C.,"Fort Sill, OK",160,149,60.0,2.0,2012-10-01,This place was definitely over hyped to me. The food was decent but it wasn't anything special.

97,Janelle E.,"Loudoun County, VA",24,138,10.0,4.0,2012-10-02,"This place is HUGE, with a beer selection to match!  There were tons of beers, even on tap, to choose from - which made it tough, but is always a good thing. The craft brews were pretty good, but nothing that stood out compared to other crafts.  We started with the calamari which was crispy and tasty, especially with the garlic aioli. I had the half salad/half flatbread combo.  I got the Black and Bleu flatbread with the steak pieces, carmelized onions, roasted red peppers and a little bleu cheese which was DELISH! I paired it with the watermelon salad which was also fantastic.  We decided to splurge and got the triple Pizookie - the red velvet, triple chocolate, and cookies and cream versions - and it was pretty good. Not the best dessert I've ever had, and I probably won't have it again, but it was tasty.  Overall, I liked the place, though I forsee it having the same fate as places like Fox and Hound - strong at first but will eventually die off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=80,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184
60,Vynetta R.,"Honolulu, HI",198,98,45.0,2.0,2012-10-03,"This restaurant location could use some serious help in customer service skills, wait times, kitchen help and over vibes. The front door guest was a bit rude. The hostess told us it would be a 30mun wait and the restaurant had maybe 25 people in it. My group of 5 bothered by that. Why make us wait when there are so many open tables. The wait time to order took over 35 min :( there was hair in one of our meals. They cooks did not prepare a new meal they just took the hair out and gave the plate back to us. They didn't offer for that meal to be free. Bad service here and they need serious training help.

101,H B.,"Wichita, KS",1,6,4.0,4.0,2012-11-19,"Came here during the off lunch hour and loved it. My friend and I ordered the shrimp lettuce wrap for appetizer and it was delicious. The Santa Fe salad and the Salmon teriyaki were suited for the taste. Also, loved the apple berry crumble that we ordered for dessert. It wasn't too sweet, although a little runny/watery, so it dripped like crazy when my friend and I took a few spoonfuls.  Overall the food was good, and the local stout wasn't too bad, but next time, I'm just going to stick to Guinness instead. The service was good, to the point of too attentive. The server stopped by every few minutes. It was understandable since we were one of the only two tables occupied at the time.

My daughters had a small sirloin steak (way too over done) - they had to scrape off the char. Because of the time it took to get our food they did not want to wait on getting another. My husband and I had a bacon cheeseburger - no flavor, and the bun was soggy and falling apart. We had to flag down our waitress to ask EACH time we wanted a refill, despite our her walking by our table deliberately ignoring us?? It seemed so. The food was mediocre at best and the service was just as bad. Probably will not be back. WAY TO OVERPRICED for what you get.

85,Mary C.,"Wichita, KS",0,5,,1.0,2012-12-19,"I came here a few weeks ago with some friends. This place was definitely not worth the long wait. I called in 30 mins early to place a reservation and when we got there, we still had to wait another hour.  After getting seated we waited some more before ordering and all our food came out cold. My friend had ordered pasta and she barely touched it because it was hard and bland. I ordered the hawaiian mahi-mahi. The portion was incredibly small and expensive. Totally not worth it. My other friend ordered the classic burger and the burger was hard and yet again cold. Even the fries were cold. We decided not to complain since we didn't have the time to wait. The service was not even that great. They didn't care too much about us and just passed by even when we were ready for our ticket and needed refills.

50,Ettya F.,"Boston, MA",307,701,206.0,4.0,2013-01-15,"It's not as if BJ's doesn't exist in other parts of the country. It's not as if BJ's dishes out peculiar hamburgers stacked with horseradish, fontina cheese and pancetta. It's not as if equally huge pizzas cannot be purchased at that chain delivery service next to your house. So if BJ's is superficially normal...and just A-OK, then why proclaim fandom?  1) Because this is Kansas, which means acquiring Ahi Poke anywhere would be a feat. Poke, as Hawaii taught me, ought to be cubed, sauced and (if going for fancy) stacked atop some sort of avocado. Even if the Poke is probably frozen, it still tastes like raw tuna, and is NOT accompanied by stomach turns. (The fried wonton chips are a little weird, but that's just a matter of preference.) 2) Pizzokies - or however they're spelled - are infinitely mouthwateringly scrumptious. If a cookie is baked in a pan, has a gooey center and crisp edges, and you don't like this sort of glucose abomination then there's something terribly wrong with you. Topping said cookie (the red velvet rules like Cider House) with a scoop of ice cream that quicky melts over and under the baked good adds a creamy richness only adding to the glorious insulin rush, to be cured by the drop in blood sugar caused by #3... 3) Monday All Day Drink Specials. Those $5 Mojitos and Martinis will get you buzzed like a fly...and unlike most chain restaurants, there's nothing cloying and hangover inducing about these light-on-the-simple-syrup, heavy-on-the-actual-ingredients drinks - case in point, you can actually taste the essence of the muddled mint in the regular mojito.

78,Nathan E.,"Falls Church, VA",46,207,3.0,4.0,2013-01-16,"For a chain brewery the beer is actually really good. The Pirahna Pale Ale was a solid one, and the Hopstorm is a decent IPA as well. I look forward to coming back and trying the rest of their brews. Other important things though: lots of TV's to watch sports on whether you're at the bar or in restaurant seating. It's extremely spacious, and while not the most interesting decor it is adequate. The food is good. I had the pork chop which was extremely tasty, albeit a bit small.

Although in recent history, I have discovered a gem of a menu item. Thanks to signing up for the BJs rewards, my wife got an e-mail on her birthday for a free pzzookie (a cookie and ice cream.) While it didn't sound bad, it certainly didn't sound like anything great when we had gone before and didn't want to spend $7 on a dessert, but for free, we figured we'd give it a try.

62,Brad S.,"Wichita, KS",357,1386,637.0,3.0,2013-09-25,"Fine. You win, BJ's. For a year I've avoided checking out the giant structure on the corner of two of the busiest streets in town, partially due to the reports of bad service (brought on by the gobsmackingly large number of people who crowd the place) and partially on account of my personal policy against reviewing chains whenever practical. But it was Saturday dinner time and I was looking for something substantial after dodging crowds in the mall, so there went that. For a ""brewhouse"" (they start brewing the beer in a central facility and send it to the restaurant to be finished), the beer was average. Of the four I sampled, three (Jeremiah Red, Nutty Brewnette, and P.M. Porter) were pretty harsh from the alcohol content. Why does a red or porter need to be brewed to 7.3 and 6.4% ABV, respectively? Take it down a notch, guys. The fourth, Tatonka Russian imperial stout, made use of its high alcohol content, but the roasty chocolate-y flavors weren't as developed as they could have been. I guess it's neat they brew so many styles you wouldn't normally find at a place like this, such as a Grand Cru or an Oktoberfest. ""We cook our burgers here to well done. Is that okay?"" No, it is most certainly NOT okay, bartender, but she didn't bat an eye when I requested it be backed down to medium, so I guess they're used to it. I appreciated the warning.  I was happy to see my request actually caused the cook to err on the side of being underdone - there was still a good bit of pink left in my burger, as well as some moisture. As a result, the Crispy Jalapeno Burger had some cruft when considering the fried jalapenos, baja sauce, chipotle mayonnaise, and pepper jack cheese, but it was otherwise not bad. It could have been a lot worse.  There are different levels of chains, and though all of them have the same end goal in mind - a consistent product that can be produced within an acceptable level of time and - the atmosphere and research and development changes objectives: McDonalds want to supply decent burgers at the fastest speed and cheapest price ($2); Red Robin offers large burgers gussied up with crazy condiments and fried toppings ($12); Ruth's Chris sells you a high end experience and a burger that's been made fresh from all the other beef sitting in the back ($20). Cheesecake Factory and BJ's fall somewhere above Red Robin, but below Ruth's Chris. Once you get to those higher tiers, however, you're balancing quality of food with experience. You want to leave customers ecstatic once they walk out the doors. This is accomplished through thousand-calorie entrees of gut-busting proportions, plenty of high-alcohol drinks to get them sufficiently sozzled, and cap it off with a giant ice cream-covered chocolate chip pizza that has people remembering it for the rest of their day and come back next weekend. No, there's nothing wrong with this chain's kind of food, but the dubious nutritional value, soulless environment, and below-average beer doesn't make me eager to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=60,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.212000000000001

We were road weary and hungry and this place seemed like our best option. We were expecting to have to drop a lot of cash for mediocre food and gimmicky service (we usually avoid big chains like this), but we were pleasantly surprised.  Our server was Kayleigh and she was great. She was friendly, timed things well, and attentive without making us feel pressured in the way that can be common (and uncomfortable) in chains places. For dinner, we got a turkey burger and the Hawaiian mahi mahi. For $12.95, my expectations for the fish were low, but it was beautifully presented and very good. So many places would charge twice as much for something that tasted frozen, and I really appreciated that it was so much better than that--a nice, healthy, reasonably-portioned and fresh-tasting meal after a long day in the car. I also appreciated that even though it was busy, we were in and out quickly (but without feeling rushed). Also, the piranha pale ale was tasty. For two meals, a tomato and mozzarella salad, and two beers, the bill was $37! Awesome. Thanks, BJs, for not selling out like other chains, and not ripping people off. That's cool of you.
