Yassmine S.,Chandler  AZ,44,4,1,7/31/2017,5.0,All i can say is AMAZINGGG CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Would definitely recommend.David (the manager) took the time from his busy schedule and contacted me personally after i had some issues from my order and had my food delivered with no cost to make it for it.I have been a customer for so long and i wouldn't change it otherwise its definitely my to go to restaurant especially for my night cravings.The food  the service and everything is on point.I come from New York so i have tried a variety of food and been to different restaurants so i pay attention to the smallest details and i want my meal to be perfect since I'm paying my money and Bjs just doesn't fail to impress.Thank you for making my days special and appreciate the great service.
Jacky C.,Tucson  AZ,235,55,102,10/16/2017,1.0,"STAY AWAY! If you\'re debating between a few restaurants and this is one of your options  you can cross BJ\'s off your list and I\'m sure you won\'t regret it. My family took my bf here for his birthday. We were seated immediately and the server came over in a timely manner. He had no knowledge of the menu- he kept offering items that were not even on the menu and then saying ""Oh sorry never mind you can\'t get that"". The food was mediocre at best.. rib eye  mahi-mahi tacos  chicken sandwich were all overpriced and it seemed like the quality was not what it used to be- More bland than it was flavorful. Anything we requested from our server  such as an extra ranch or drink refill  were forgotten about. The server ID\'d my bf when he ordered a beer and noted that it was his birthday the day before our visit  but forgot it when it was time for dessert and we had to remind him. We ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. The server informed us  to my bf\'s disappointment  that they were out of vanilla ice cream and will have to give us chocolate instead. My bf is not a fan of chocolate (what a weirdo  right) and passed on the pizookie but they brought out the cookie anyway. About 5-10 mins later  we see dessert plates being brought out with VANILLA ICE CREAM. I guess they restocked but we were not informed  received no apology and the server had made no effort to make things right. To top off our amazing experience  my bf  my sister and I ended up in and out of the restroom all night from 2 in the morning til now thanks to the mahi-mahi tacos we decided to try. If I had to diagnose that  I\'m going to guess that we\'ve got food poisoning. I called the manager on duty this morning to explain everything that had happened to her and she had no sympathy or desire to make things right. Don\'t waste your time or your money! There are sooo many other options than a place that has no respect for your needs or your time. You. Deserve. Better."
Sarah W.,Chandler  AZ,155,311,175,8/1/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Probably by far top servers we have ever got definitely top 10 for sure. The pizza is good which is why it gets three stars but when we went last night I just couldn't believe how long it took when she was not the only server working. You would think when you are serving so close to your managers or leads that you would be working better to show your strengths but this was terrible. She not once ever refilled my water even after asking and putting it out for her to see. She never once looked at how I never touched my Awful margarita and said hey I noticed you haven't touched your margarita is everything okay? Nope not once. My fianc asked for a side of ranch and we definitely never got that either. I seriously couldn't believe how little this server cared.Definitely will not be back anytime soon. Maybe a different location is better or just order to go from now on for their specials.
Norm R.,Phoenix  AZ,459,655,3227,10/30/2017,4.0,Though chain restaurants are not much of my thing  I like this one because of the friendly service  the well-stocked bar and the wide beer selection from which you can order flights  and good food (tip: if you can't decide what to order and you like pizza  get the BJ's favorite!) served in generous portions. For sports buffs  the big screens are a big draw as well. The restaurant is one of the establishments on the periphery of the Chandler Mall  so location is convenient and parking is never a problem.
William L.,Chandler  AZ,32,173,48,11/18/2017,3.0,Went with some coworkers to just have a leisurely lunch. Ended up grabbing a BLT sandwich and the others grabbed the Mac and cheese and salad. My BLT sandwich was great tasting and crisp (not soggy). The fries were pretty good as well. Both my coworkers loved the salad and Mac and cheese. The staff was really nice and attentive. The only complaint I really had was the wait time for the food. It took a decent amount of time for the food to come out and the place wasn't that busy so was curious why the long wait (30 mins for the food approximately). Overall  I'd come back but would probably push on faster food service.
Shawna A.,Chandler  AZ,0,9,,11/30/2017,1.0,"BJs was a place that my husband and I frequently would visit  mainly due to the late hours they have. We routinely pick up food from here and have given this restaurant multiple chances after they CONSTANTLY mess up our orders and finally  enough is enough  and I can\'t see a time when we\'re coming back. Back on Veternan\'s Day my husband and I picked up food to go; my order was severely messed up (missing toppings  wrong side)  and I called the restaurant to let them know. The worker was apologetic and said we would get refunded; I gave our card number that it was purchased on and three weeks later  still no refund. Obviously  refunds don\'t take that long so we went back into the restaurant to ask about the refund. While we waited for a manager  one of the chefs came out and discussed how ""crazy"" the restaurant was and busy on Veteran\'s Day  and they messed up a lot of orders. I chuckled inside because I was thinking  first of all  a restaurant should be prepared to deal with demand  secondly; you mess up our orders all the time. Eventually  the manager came out who really seems to be like a nice guy; we have talked to him several times due to the multiple times our orders are botched. He offered us either our money back or a $25 gift card  so we accepted the gift card and left. Later  we wanted to grab dinner  so I ordered food from BJ\'s on their application. I ordered a sandwich and a turkey burger and within minutes my cell phone rang  it was BJs saying the order had come through as a large pizza and that the cooks in the back thought it was odd that a pizza had mayo on it  so they figured something had happened. What was confusing is the fact that they assumed it was a pizza  but they said all the customizations we added to our order were visible. My husband made sure they could see all of our customizations  asked about them  and they said they had the order correct  and it would be ready for pick-up shortly. When my husband went to pick up our order  after being in there for 20 minutes or so  he saw the turkey burger had a side salad with it. He questioned the worker saying that wasn\'t right  and she argued that the turkey burger comes with a side salad WITHOUT dressing. He said I know  but my wife changed her side to fries (why would you argue and what is the point of customizing an order if they can\'t get it right?). My husband then was obviously skeptical that the rest of the order was right  and he asked if the turkey burger had onions on it (I love onions and previously when I ordered the turkey burger they left onions off  which is stupid because one of the toppings it comes with IS onions)  the worker replied that onions were on it because it comes on it. Well  thankfully my hubby is smart or just knows how bad they are  so he asked for some onions on the side. Anyway  we get home; I go to look at the toppings on my turkey burger and sure enough -- no onions. I could go on and on about all the times that they have messed up our order  and even though we had a gift card  we still paid too much for service and food like this. One other example  one time we placed a take-out order and ordered a specific pizookie - the restaurant wasn\'t able to see what flavor pizookie we wanted  and what flavors of ice cream  so instead of calling us  they gave us whatever they wanted (are you kidding? Prices are way too high for this kind of service). We are very loyal customers  and we won\'t be coming back anytime soon. Something with the way this restaurant runs is severely broken and obviously nothing is fixing it. The sad part is this was our first time being back since they messed up our previous order  and here they go again getting it wrong. It is sad that places like McDonald\'s mess up my order a lot less than a place that is much more expensive."
Alley R.,San Diego  CA,34,233,1012,5/3/2017,4.0,Free beer for teachers  vets  military and other heroes. Fresh made pizza  craft beer  excellent service and kindness to Alley....what more can I say. Support your local B.J. pizza because they support those who support the community. Alley will be back for their happy hour!
Shelby P.,Bend  OR,0,2,,11/2/2017,4.0,I was in Chandler this past week visiting family and it was my first time at Bj's. My brother told me he had been once before and the food was great but service was lacking. Our Server was Ian  he was very informative about the menu and catered to all of my allergy needs. He guided me to the gluten free pizza which was a delicious choice along with a bowl of the broccoli cheddar soup  such a yummy suggestion! My brother didn't want pizza so Ian suggested the roast beef dip and he loved it too! As busy as it was Ian kept our cups filled and was present just the right amount. Thank you for a wonderful experience and for being kind on the eyes! Ask for Ian for your next visit!
Eric B.,Chandler  AZ,784,475,870,1/17/2017,4.0,Been coming to this BJs for about 7 years  so I can't believe it took me until now to write a review! BJ's quality is always there when it comes to the brews and deep dish pizzas. My fav item on the menu used to be the calzone until they took it off--bring it back guys! They also have some bomb salads if you're not in the mood to go carb-heavy. But of course  the star of the show is the famous Pizookie! I've had all different kinds but the original chocolate chip is still the best. If you haven't been to BJ's yet  you need to do yourself a favor and head over! Your taste buds will thank you!
Jess H.,Gilbert  AZ,0,3,,11/2/2017,5.0,Christian J. was our server and he was simply amazing. He had phenomenal customer service! He was very personable  had a great sense of humor  and was always on top of it. Thank you  Christian!
Scott B.,Prescott Valley  AZ,88,59,87,6/2/2017,4.0,What an amazing menu! I have a list of menu items I MUST TRY! Very upscale! But reasonable prices.
Keerthi V.,Gilbert  AZ,14,59,63,7/3/2017,4.0,We came here for a family meal and it was pretty good. It's a nice atmosphere  dark in the restaurant. Our waiter was really nice. She answered all my questions and asked in the kitchen to check that the bread bowl was vegan. They had a vegan option labeled on the menu  a lentil soup. They also had other plates that could be made vegan. I ordered guacamole and the soup. The appetizer came out quickly and was great. Our food came out really late and they mixed up my order but the manager came out and apologized and checked in with us. The food was really good  pretty filling. It's a good place to go for big groups and for a nice dinner. Everyone in our group found something they liked on the menu and everyone ended up happy with their meal. Would recommend this place!
Brian R.,Saint Louis  MO,85,245,773,10/22/2016,4.0,BJs  for a chain  is quite good. This location is at the Chandler Mall  so it can get busy during peak dining and shopping hours. As a local brewery  they have a huge bar  and you can see the brewery tanks in the restaurant as you eat. The waiter was friendly and patient with us  as we took awhile to decide on our entrees. He was attentive during the meal.The pub/bar food is actually good  unlike some breweries that have great beer but only mediocre food. I had the double burger loaded with onions  cheese  a house made bun  and a side of onion strings. They cooked the burger medium as requested  and it was well seasoned with the proper amount of juiciness. The onion strings were amazing!For dessert  their chocolate chip pizookie is the best. A soft baked 6-7 inch deep dish cookie topped with ice cream and whipped cream.
Tony N.,Mesa  AZ,0,25,21,6/28/2017,3.0,I'll make this simple. Me and my girlfriend wanted to try something different and I've heard good things about Bj's  so we decided to eat there. We were seated and after we got our drinks  our server disappeared for a good 10 minutes before she showed up to take our order. The food... Oh man  my girlfriend ordered pasta(forgot the name)  it was so undercooked and tasted like it was froze and microwaved. I wanted to return it back to the kitchen  but it was too much of a hassle to find the server since she disappeared again. I bought the bison burger  which was good. We tried the dessert and that was amazing.Overall  I gave 2 stars for the decor and 1 star for the service and food.
Makesha F.,Phoenix  AZ,63,13,1,9/7/2017,3.0,This was my first time coming to a BJs in Arizona  it was okay. The food was pretty good  I had the avocado rolls and the Peruvian Shrimp Quinoa Bowl. Oh let me just state  the water is disgusting it's tastes like dirt therefore I would recommend a Pellegrino. The service was good  our servers name was Steve and he was a delight making our experience better.
Lily L.,Chandler  AZ,26,63,,8/19/2017,4.0,I'm not usually a fan chain restaurants  but BJ's does a pretty good job of making you forget your are at one. The menu can be overwhelming but the food is consistently good and the service is attentive. I think some of the prices are ridiculously expensive  like who would pay $16 for spaghetti  but I don't blame this location. In summary  the food and service is good and the menu offers a nice variety.
Grant C.,Tempe  AZ,36,71,61,10/4/2016,4.0,This was the first time here that was not a 5 star review. Came here with my family and my sister does not eat chicken. It was my fathers birthday. All started well. But we orders drinks and I orders a AMF it came out looked amazing. Normally I love amf's. but this one tasted like well tequila. It was horrible. Only had about 3/8ths. Enjoyed some wine and our food came. It was amazing tell my sisters order came out.  She told the waitress clearly no no chicken. She only eats seafood. So she orders a shrimp salad. And got a chicken salad.  We had to complain 2 times. Normally love eating here. They have us 2 free deserts for our large table. That's what saved the rating. It would have been a 2 star.  We will be back again
Ben D.,Tempe  AZ,3,160,,3/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,We decided to stop by here Friday night. I go because my better half likes two particular things here. The good is good. I ordered the salmon with rice and broccoli. It was really good. I decided to try their root beer (maybe) ribs. They were not bad at all. I liked them. The next time I go back I might try a rib entre. I do not drink anymore so can not comment on their beers.
Traci T.,Los Angeles  CA,34,46,14,8/3/2017,5.0,There's just so many options here and I've never had a bad experience here with food nor staff. Just a great place for food any time of day. However  I particularly like to go here later at night for a drink and a great meal followed by a chocolate chip pazookie. Yummy!
Amanda L.,Mesa  AZ,64,12,2,5/18/2017,5.0,"We put our name on a call ahead list at the restaurant and when we got their they had ""lost"" our call in reservation. They said they would do their best to seat us in 20 minutes. 50 minutes later (7pm) my soon was hungry.I asked for a manager and explained what happened she said she would seat us right away and get us a free appetizer. I have a food allergies and appetizers are hard for my diet. The manager said she would see what else she could do. When the waiter came by he was amazing. He let me ""create"" a sandwich that was not even on the menu to meet my allergies. It was delicious.He then came back and told me our whole meal was comped and wished me a happy Mother\'s Day!The executed excellent customer service!!"
Connor G.,Gilbert  AZ,96,15,6,6/20/2017,4.0,Have gone to this Bj's multiple times  but I just wanted to make this review in reference to Father's Day. We went there for a late lunch  and it was pretty busy. They seated us as fast as they could  and the service was very good. They even gave us a free glass and a gift card for a follow up visit just because it was Father's day. The food was good  but the only thing that doesn't make it into the 5 star range is the fact that the food didn't absolutely wow us. The huge 12+ page menu made it hard to make a choice.
Carmik T.,Gilbert  AZ,66,373,692,2/1/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Came in after a gymnastics event on Saturday right at lunch time. Busy  but seated right away! We had a party of 9 -served by Jessica; she was outstanding!Had the lettuce wraps  fresh   crispy leaves of lettuce served with a Asian chicken mixture: accompanied by a side of hot mustard & teriyaki sauce!Really good  wonderful light meal.Pizza (6 sliced/ med) Pepperoni & had them add fresh garlic and basil.BBQ chopped chicken salad was piled high to perfection!Caesar salad was a generous portion for a main meal.Side order of fries same deal!Pasta dishes are always on point!Again  this is the place we always end up. Great service  great food for all. Many options!!
Cali F.,Mesa  AZ,421,113,98,2/16/2017,5.0,Came here with a friend yestarday to grab a bite to eat for lunch. The atmosphere was dim lighting  cozy type of feeling. I was promptly greeted by their hostess and escorted to my both. My waitress was there with in minutes and brought our of waters with in minutes. We wornt sure what to get for a appetizer so we asked the waitress what she would recommend. She suggested the avocado spring we went with her suggestion. They were pretty tasty. What ever the sause that they gave you for the dip was amazing. You literally could drink it tasted so good jkkk. My friend ordered there bacon guacamole cheese burger and subbed the french fries for a soup. She really cheeseburger phenomenal. I took a bite of the burger and it was pretty good. I ordered their California club sandwich at the recommendation of the Waitress and sub the Fry's for there Caesar salad. I was surprised at how big the saled was I couldn't even finish it. The sandwich was very good chicken with season perfectly . Good portions I would only eat half of it. For dessert we ordered there mint Pizookie which was phenomena. The only done side was we waited forever to get out desert. Waited way longer then we should have. We did not mention this to our server. After out check arrived the Manger came over to apologize abiut how long ir took our desserts out. That was very much appreciated.
Kate M.,Chandler  AZ,691,376,2820,9/29/2015,5.0,5-star Happy Hour! We had a bunch of beverages and a bunch of food for 35 bucks! Can you believe that? The bartender...I think his name is Geoffrey...took great care of us. Next time we need to leave room for a pizookie. That Harvest Hefeweizen is so good it took me back to old Bavaria AND made me blaspheme. Now that's a great beer! We always enjoy stopping in at BJ's.
Elia B.,Atascadero  CA,15,116,233,8/28/2016,4.0,Ordered to goNo curbside pickup No reserved spots for to go customers They did good though As always PIZZA was greatDefinitely eat in next time
Suzie B.,Gilbert  AZ,0,3,1,3/21/2017,5.0,Great food and great pazookies! Menu is insane...lots to choose from. Highly recommend on Tuesdays - half price wine AND $3 pazookies!! Will be back for sure!
Vladmir T.,Scottsdale  AZ,1233,819,1247,5/5/2016,4.0,My impression of BJs is that many of my guy friends love to meet here for pizza and beers when I am in town... The pizza is good.The service was good considering how busy they can get.They can really accommodate large groups for sure too!Worth a taste.
Clifford S.,Phoenix  AZ,11,34,2,6/30/2017,3.0,First time here and it was interesting. Spent ten minutes waiting for three different hostesses to find a table for me to sit at. There was practically nobody in the place. Food was good. Service was mediocre at best. Don't come here thirsty. They don't give refills even though the menu says free refills. Overall good but for the price and drive I will go across the street to Cheddars.
Stephen F.,Paradise Valley  AZ,0,66,,3/8/2017,3.0,Ill keep this short and sweet.Good: food  some of the beers. Their Piranha Pale Ale was fantastic.Bad: some of the beers. Their Irish red (I forget its name) was one of the worst beers Ive ever had.
Kat P.,Mesa  AZ,43,175,340,3/19/2016,3.0,BJ's Brewhouse Chandler is located at the mall. We met some friends here for dinner on their suggestion. Being at the mall during spring break is not my idea of a good time  so there's that. Parking was a nightmare.Wait time was very short  and the restaurant itself was busy but not too loud. the.menu was great. We started with calamari and salads. The calamari was very salty  but was cooked well  so as not to be rubbery. The Caesar salad was great. Before the main course  I ran out of water. Where's the server? Who knows. Eventually I see her and beg for some.The entrees arrive with perfect timing. Our friends order jumbalaya and the shrimp asparagus penne. I also chose the penne  and my husband the Mahi Mahi with shrimp on couscous. He really enjoyed his meal  as did I. Then  I ran out of water. I steal my husband's. I run out of his water. I don't see the server until everyone is dine and she offers the dessert menu. I drink my water refill in one second flat.We're not quite ready for dessert  bit are chatting and randomly glancing at the menu. For all the mad - dogging and dessert preasure  you'd think that I could get a flippin' glass of water!We eventually order the Pizookie trio  sampling the macadamia nut  Ghirardelli triple chocolate and the salted caramel. Holy chocolate balls these were good! And then I ran out of water. She drops the check before the dessert comes. Some other dude brings dessert. She promptly collects the check and we never see her again. I have imbibed everyone's water. The server was nice enough  but seemed more intent on rushing us through  maybe to get off in time? I'm not a pain in the butt  and I've been a server  so I'm polite  not needy  and tip really well  so I don't think watching the beverages of your tables is too much to ask.And then...the restroom.Going into the restroom felt like a transporter into a bus station bathroom...in Mexico. It was beyond gross. One stall was locked but appeared empty. A staff member had locked herself in another and was on the phone professing her love to her man in Spanish. That left the hc stall. Feces covering the toilet seat  toilet paper everywhere like a bomb went off...just gross. My husband said that the men's room was worse. He said that is was flooded from a toilet and also in severe disarray.While we enjoyed our food and company  we will not likely come back. They need to do some major examination of cleanliness and service practices.
Alice S.,Phoenix  AZ,0,3,2,7/4/2017,2.0,Don't order the pulled pork burger. Poor quality pork  fatty and with mysterious looking pieces of pork. The quality of the meal was poor. Meal was free after complaint.
Lisett V.,Gilbert  AZ,0,3,,10/29/2016,5.0,My husband and I have been a customer for many years. My recent experience was above and beyond. We typically always receive excellent service from Tracy at the bar but I had to reach out to express my gratitude to the Manager David Renish!Under the direction of David Renish the Senior Manager  one of his team members brought to his attention that we dropped some cash on the floor and were unaware of it until the next day.David Renish called me and texted us that night to let us know that he found it and was going to hold it for us until we were able to visit again. The genuineness of the team to let the manager know that we dropped cash and did not keep it  is just another reason why we will be loyal customers of BJ's.I just wanted to let Chandler BJ's members of the team that they are amazing!!!Oh and the food and beer are AMAZING TOO!!
Markesha H.,Yuma  AZ,0,33,,9/8/2017,2.0,Visited this location at lunch time. The server was unattentive and didn't even refill my water. This location will not be visited by me again. I am accustomed to great service at BJs especially when its really empty like at lunch.
Kenny O.,Odessa  TX,23,61,77,5/22/2017,4.0,Important points  good food  fair service.Our server was very attentive  refills on drinks  fast calamari-hot crispy..good. It took 6-minutes. She was the perfect server  but stuck with looking bad because food takes longer. BJ management can see on the food tickets on how long the food takes. Get with it guys  BJ's has a menu unmatched but service has always been a tad challenging. We sat on a Sunday. the wait was 10-15  and we got in in 10. That's good. Religiously  the food takes a while  but a quality product take time. it shouldn't take 25-mites for a lunch. Just think if you have a 1/2-hr for lunch I would not go here. BJ's consistently takes longer. They can improve  but my past 5-years of eats has shown otherwise. Dinners are 28-32-minute wait  great quality  and the TV's are what can help pass the time. I hate to sound racist but  my 15-years of food service industry  I'd hire Hispanic cooks. You can bet if you go to any restaurant and there are Hispanic folks cooking  it will get to you fast. It will be quality food.We had a hand battered chicken strips  very good. The green chili burger was thick  hot and tasty. Not real juicy  cooked well done  but I had a bite it was good. I had the Asian salad  which was great  with the crunchy won ton skins mmm good. My son got the pepperoni deep dish  which is just like Gino's East in Chicago...amazing. This is why I gave this place 4-stars. If they can serve their lunches in 15-minutes  and dinners in 18  then they'd be a hit.
Dana B.,Gilbert  AZ,394,725,582,8/2/2016,2.0,The website features food that is no longer offered so we made the trip here for nothing. The stars are for the server who was professional and friendly. She would get a great review but the business does not.
Jeongwha H.,Phoenix  AZ,1,25,25,5/26/2017,2.0,"When is it ok for a bartender to say ""hold on second"" because she is having important conversations w other customers on what beers She doesn\'t like? Excuse me but since when a customer wants to pay the bill and the bartender says ""hold on second"" with an irritated voice? Impolite and arrogant attitude in customer service brings down anyone who wants to go out. Bj- you are out of my list to go."
Lisa K.,Phoenix  AZ,31,4,2,5/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,After I wrote my previous review  the general manager contacted me within an hour. He apologized for the food and the manager's response. He asked me to return. Dinner on him. My cousin and I returned this past weekend. The food was great. The service was fantastic. I am back in the fan column. Like I said previously. I can accept an off day. I cannot accept disinterest and lack of ownership. Excellent bounce back.
Gavin I.,Chandler  AZ,13,3,,5/9/2017,2.0,Usually we really enjoy this location but the service and food quality has gone downhill. Waiter did not take empty drink glasses from the table and was not very attentive. Some serious re-training needs to happen.
Adam A.,Pearl City  HI,633,298,636,6/10/2016,3.0,I really should stop eating at chains..It's not that they do anything wrong  its that they don't really do anything really well..I get it get the pizza  OMG the pizookie bleh.. any bj across the nation has this  what happened to chains having individuality with their menus? At least their beer selection is local and growlers are available hence the 3 stars  but I think I'll pass on the food in the future...
Andy B.,Cypress  TX,0,21,,4/17/2017,2.0,Monday at 8:30 pm.....why is service terrible?Place isn't crowded  yet I gotta get up from the table to chase down the waiter for another beer. Not being total hater  food was pretty good. Really liked the thin crust pizza.
Margo L.,Tempe  AZ,121,28,1,7/29/2017,2.0,This was my third visit to this location and my boyfriend and I were dissatisfied to say the least. This time around my deep dish pizza came out on a plate  not in the pan  and the bottom was completely mutilated. Once again I was brought nothing to separate the pizza so my fork and butter knife had to suffice. We ordered a pizookie trio  and they brought out the wrong flavor. I told our waiter  (who was awesome by the way) and he brought out another one right away. Which yet again was the incorrect flavor. The manager on duty came by our table to ask about our experience and I told her what happened. She proceeded to attempt to argue with me about what flavor the second pizookie was then quickly walked away and came back with our check. They ended up comping our meal because they goofed up. The first time we came to this location we had a similar experience. Awesome server yet again  but the kitchen staff just couldn't get it right. The food runners brought our food to the wrong table both times  and failed to bring anything to but the pizza with. The first time around we waited an extremely long time for our food to arrive and the restaurant was completely dead. On all three occasions we came it seemed like our servers were the only ones doing anything. The food runners and bus boys stood around gossiping and twiddling their thumbs. Not impressed at all.
Bruno S.,Maricopa  AZ,106,85,118,3/12/2016,5.0,My wife and I went for the first time with a couple friends. Our friends raved the food at B.J.s. My wife had the pulled pork and I had the Jumbalaya. Both were absolutely amazing! We also shared a bowl of some of the best broccoli cheese soup around. The service was great. The wait was quick. The most overwhelming part of the visit was choosing what to eat with an array of options. I am definitely looking forward to taking my children or any family that might visit from out of state.UPDATE: Went here for a second time. The service was great. Most of the food was good. AVOID the boneless wings. Unfortunately they are not that great..for as much good food they have here boneless wings are a no go.
Mary W.,Mesa  AZ,0,13,,8/10/2017,5.0,My sister and her husband asked us to meet them at BJ's. We had never been there so  we didn't know what to expect.What a pleasant surprise!Our server was wonderful.She was very attentive without being intrusive.The food was fantastic and the portions were huge.We all had a cocktail and they were mixed to perfection.We had such a great time and We look forward to visiting BJ's again soon.
Leslie B.,Chandler  AZ,50,153,346,3/16/2015,5.0,We came here on a Saturday around 5 pm . This was our first time here   and it was a very happy find ! We were seated immediately   and had drinks served right away. I tried the very berry cider (very refreshing) for dinner I had the fried fish and wedge cut seasoned fries . It was served steaming hot & fresh . My bf ordered the turkey club and wedge cut seasoned fries . He was thrilled with his dinner as well. We will Definitely be back
Enriqueta Q.,Chandler  AZ,0,3,,10/2/2016,5.0,Manager Shilo and server Dominic you guys are amazing. Last night was our first time ever there and you took care of us. Shilo thank you for taking the time to congratulate my son on his accomplishments. You will see the Quintero's soon!Muchas gracias
Emily G.,Lordsburg  NM,2,6,,5/8/2016,5.0,"If you ever want to have your tits blown clean off because of excellent food and even better service  look no further than this BJ\'s. I came in with 12 people about two hours till closing time and expected the staff to be a bit salty  but they were anything but. Our waitress came in clutch and scored us a nice spot that accommodated everyone - she was super friendly. Next  David (who I assume is the manager) came in and swept us away. He greeted us in a warm manner and made us feel very welcome. Our appetizers came out quickly and were fuckin\' excellent. I swear those mozzarella sticks multiply when you\'re not looking. The potato skins were amazing  too. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled  never had to check if our order was put in correctly  never had to complain - everything was wonderful. When it came time to split the check  things got kind of hairy because we wanted to split one giant ass pizzookie twelve ways - but David was like ""I got you  fam "" and split that shit up like it was no one\'s damn business. He was such a sweetheart. The guy taking our cards at the end was hilarious and had a wonderful sense of humor. Squad will definitely be coming here again. 10/10 would recommend"
Beth L.,Mesa  AZ,44,89,375,8/17/2015,4.0,I dined here after work today  Monday. Not crowded but still a good number of people in here. This place is huge. Open and clean. Large out door seating. We were seated promptly and our waiter took our drink order right away. While our waiter got our food and drinks timely  he just didn't give the welcoming feeling. I ordered the Parmesan chicken  mash potatoes and broccoli. I thought the side salad came with the dinner but it doesn't. Charged $3.50 for it. I'm used to getting a dinner salad with my entre at other places  so I was surprised this wasn't included. Daughter ordered the chicken and avocado flat bread pizza. She said the sauce was a little spicy and she picked off the avocados. The food was cooked well and had plenty of flavor. BJ's had a large menu. From tacos  burgers  pizza to steaks and pasta. Something for everyone.
Lyn P.,Chandler  AZ,49,42,10,12/27/2016,3.0,The food was just okay. Service was good. Meals were overpriced and the quality wasn't that great. I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't go back and probably would not recommend coming here to anyone. Upscale Applebee's type place. I would only go for drinks.
James L.,Chandler  AZ,2,49,63,11/7/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,August gave us a great experience here. Really superb person  asked us a lot of questions and after a few samples we made some great beer choices. Very friendly and great BJ's staff. The food is wonderful here and really a slick efficient place. We highly recommend   Tracy is serving us tonight  I think we're going on 14 years of her serving us  first class bartender!
Keith J.,Gilbert  AZ,55,63,12,4/30/2016,5.0,I was craving the chicken parmigiana  which evidently had been taken off of the menu for some unknown reason. I asked the waiter about it and they made it anyway. It was awesome. We also had the gluten free pizza which is evidently one of the best around. Even a gluten free pizookie  which was amazing! Very busy  but they do take call a heads with parties of six or less. Conveniently placed sports so that you can converse and not miss the action. A great experience. Thanks  BJ's!
Mike C.,El Paso  TX,9,399,118,4/19/2016,4.0,"I really enjoyed my visit and meal at BJ\'s Restaurant and Brewhouse. Service was definitely excellent  and the food tasted great. I tried one of their blonde beers  and was delighted with the taste. I did notice my mouth was really dry about an hour after eating  so I kinda think they must use flavor enhancers like MSG. MSG doesn\'t sit well with me - makes me tired and thirsty. I also had a glass of tea which was very strong and nice to drink. They offer various flavors of tea  but I just had mine ""plain"". Definitely worth a visit!"
Robert L.,Omaha  NE,101,133,938,7/15/2015,3.0,I've been here before. It's clean  the prices are decent. Great beer and liquor selection- lots of cocktails. Pretty diverse menu but stick with the pub grub. Service was great last night and we had a big group. Downside  beers a little warm and I tired a steak for the first time. Don't bother. Yes  dear  I ate the asparagus and it was quite good- but the fries looked better. All in all  ik place to go but don't stray too far from the traditional menu.
Shazz S.,Phoenix  AZ,1,26,1,11/25/2016,5.0,This is a favorite place for my wife and I. The service and food are always very good. The desert is very good also. We have been here quite a few times and have never been disappointed. Make sure to try the lemon pepper wings and the thin crust pizza.
Jamie A.,Reno  NV,27,24,25,5/28/2017,3.0,Bjs.. well where do I begin. Food has always been so so.. nothing amazing. I come here because its convenient but truly nothin to brag about. One thing I dislike is the fact that all customers expect to wait at Bjs.. its different if you wait and you get 5 star service and food is amazing... but all it you get is Okay. You wait to get seated and you wait a long time to get food  even just appetizers.. when its busy youre lucky if you get your glass refilled with water without having to ask couple of times. This could be a good place... could be.
Nancy M.,Chandler  AZ,21,445,700,3/18/2016,3.0,Let me start by saying that Jeff  our server  is what saved this review from being a 1. I was sorely disappointed by the hostess that greeted us. She was flippant and unprofessional- not a great representation of what I'm sure BJ's would expect your experience to be upon entering their restaurant.  Fast forward to being seated (after a 10-minute wait that the hostess said would be a 25-minute wait). Jeff promptly arrived  introduced himself and took awesome care of us from beginning to end. So he gets 5-stars  hands down!
Vanessa G.,Phoenix  AZ,54,32,,10/18/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,UPDATE: Not even 24 hours after my previous review  the manager for this particular BJ's eached out to me via phone and asked me about my experience. As a courtesy  they provided me with a gift card for my next visit in lieu of the not-so-great previous experience. I honestly did not expect them to even care enough to read through their reviews and make contact either. This is a clear sign of business that knows what it is doing and knows how to handle themselves. I have always loved BJ's and will continue to visit in the future! Great food and even better staff!
Jayde L.,Chandler  AZ,22,30,3,10/20/2016,3.0,I love the Nutty Brewnette  it's a great beer. The food is pretty decent  but not always amazing. I have good food and I've had OK food. If you're in the area it's worth a try.
Danielle L.,Phoenix  AZ,153,68,41,1/14/2015,2.0,S'more Pizzokie  Nuff Said! I mean.. I wish that was all there was to say. I'm lucky to have friends that love dessert  so we met there late night with a purpose. And that was to devour these delicious cookies we'd heard so many delightful things about. Delightful they were (albeit a bit smaller compared to others) but they were indeed delicious. The problem  however  had everything to do with our experience outside of dessert. The service was slow  and minimal at best. We waited quite a while to get seated in a nearly empty restaurant  only to eventually seat ourselves. We then waited some more before somebody finally took notice to help us. And then waited some more (a ton more) for them to take our order and eventually bring our food. We realized that during the wait happy hour had kicked in  so we ordered a few more things. BIG mistake. Big wait for a big let down.Just an underwhelming experience all around  and our server was grumpy to boot. Not happy that I recommended this place  and it's highly unlikely that I ever would again.
Sandie I.,Fontana  CA,92,3,,8/3/2016,1.0,So we went in the other day for lunch  we waited 10-15 minutes before our waitress came to the table for our drink order so we ordered our drinks and avocado egg rolls  then about 10 min later we ordered our food  45 minutes later she stopped by to bring refills and brought the wrong drinks and said our food should be here soon. She went to the register and looks like she put in our order then 20 more minutes then our food came but was wrong. Then she took $5 off our bill really I don't need a discount maybe you should pay attention to your customers  I mean there weren't that may people in the restaurant and most of the servers were just standing around.
Erin L.,Chandler  AZ,131,41,64,3/5/2016,3.0,Came in on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend not busy at all in the place. Service was okay nothing spectacular server seemed like he had better places to be than serving us. We shared the baked ziti because we were catching a movie after. The dish was very yummy we were quite impressed. Then ordered the pizza cookie with the chocolate chip and peanut butter it was okay much much better at oreganos and you get a lot more of it. The dish is very shallow and he amount of ice cream outweighs how much cookie you actually get. I might come back for happy hour sometime to try that out.
Kathy M.,Chandler  AZ,17,5,,10/3/2016,5.0,Something for everyone. Great staff. Awesome environment to watch sports. Have held a few large gatherings for family here and wouldn't go anywhere else. Always a go to place for out of town visors. Been a coming here for 7 yrs and never get tired of it. Continuously updating the menu with new cuisine. They offer gluten free and vegan fare. Microbews are amazing. Have been to BJ in other states but love this one the best.
Becky H.,Chandler  AZ,0,3,,5/29/2017,1.0,We went there on a Sunday afternoon  it was not busy  the hostess immediately sat us. Despite the restaurant having numerous open tables she sat us directly next to another couple. And then we sat there and after 10 minutes without even waters or a server stopping by to say they would be with us soon we left. Completely unacceptable
Daniel B.,Gilbert  AZ,38,7,,10/21/2016,5.0,It's slightly upscale  but not enough for it to be a turn off if you're just out an about.
Jonathan C.,Chandler  AZ,28,92,273,1/2/2015,4.0,Love this place it's always fun times. Make sure you come early or you can be waiting for a seat but it's well worth it. The food is amazing can't wait till my bison burger gets here. The pizza is fantastic and the pizzoki for dessert is the best. If your looking for a good craft beer tap list it's pretty well done.
Dan F.,Chandler  AZ,0,5,,10/8/2016,5.0,Our family went to BJ's restaurant recently  It was a great experience. The food was very tasty. The kid meals food and portion size was also great. They have a new expanded menu with new offerings and now offer gluten-free buns for their hamburgers. The waitress was great  but the highlight was when the manager  David  came over to help us with the new BJ's app. We had trouble logging in and the manager took the time to help us and then when we still could not log-in  he offered to give our contact information to his tech guru at headquarters. David was very personable and you could tell by talking to him that he took a lot of pride in his restaurant and was very loyal to the company.We finished off our meal with a delicious gluten-free pizzookie  which the whole family enjoyed.
Valerie W.,Phoenix  AZ,204,23,1,9/21/2016,5.0,Our server  Kevin  was great! Christy  although not our server  was super attentive and friendly! Highly recommend them as waiters
Loving Life A.,Phoenix  AZ,0,15,,10/16/2016,5.0,Big fan of the food and service. I frequent about every month or so over the years. Have never had any problems. These days I attend with the family - 2 kids  2 parents and 2 grandparents.
Bill B.,Chandler  AZ,567,20,11,9/19/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,"I cant say enough good things about the BJ\'s Restaurant and Brewhouse in Chandler  our favorite restaurant!! We are on a first name basis with David the manager who is always friendly and visible. The man works hard as we see him during practically every visit. During our most recent visit we met server Crystal and had a marvelous experience with her. She was attentive  engaging and very funny. She completed yet another wonderful dining experience! The food is consistently delicious no matter what you order from their extensive menu. They also offer different/new in-house micro-brews throughout the year. Its always a treat trying their latest concoction! Last  if you have not attended one of BJ\'s ""Beer Dinners"" you really need to make it a point to do so. During the beer dinners you are served a variety of BJ\'s delicious foods  usually 4 courses  accompanied by a beer selected to compliment the chosen food and of course  your palate. Again  BJ\'s in Chandler is by far our favorite go-to place to eat where we visit monthly!"
TJ H.,Chandler  AZ,652,241,347,8/29/2015,3.0,"C\'s school was having a family dinner night fundraiser. Since BJ\'s is just outside of the mall near the theater  parking can be a pain. Luckily C & I found parking within a few passes.BJ\'s is a large restaurant with a menu that offers something for everyone. We had a short wait to be seated  maybe 10 minutes. Our server didn\'t introduce himself. He brought drink refills when needed but was absent most of the meal.C ordered the kids 6"" deep dish pizza. Fruit salad as a side. Our server informed us that the pizza did not come with a side like the other kid\'s meals. C likes fruit so I said fine  add on the side of fruit. C liked his pizza but not the chunks of tomatoes that were all over it. I ate them. C said the crust was a bit sweet  like Old Chicago\'s  but it was an ok mini pie. The fruit bowl was a joke. Cubed watermelon with 3 grapes. Pathetic.I ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Guacamole  Smoked Bacon  Pepper Jack Cheese  Chipotle Mayo  Red Onions  Jalapenos & Tomatoes. The burger was cooked right. The chipotle mayo was pretty lame. Not a whole lot of flavor. Overall  it was a decent burger and the side of fries were quite tasty.OK service  lousy fruit side  decent burger & fries  not a very attentive server. 3 Stars"
Mike M.,Tempe  AZ,51,39,7,5/24/2015,4.0,It's a good place. The food was pretty decent but the soup my wife got was luke warm and pretty boring. I had the spicy pig flatbread which was really good but even the waiter admitted the jalapeos were out of a can and lacked some heat. Their beer was excellent. I had their IPA and their Double IPA which were stronger IPAs that are the best local IPAs I've had. So yes  I'd say go and try this place out. The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone.
Jackie B.,Gilbert  AZ,53,11,7,9/4/2016,4.0,This has got to be our favorite restaurant  bar none. The food is always top notch  we have never ordered something that we did not like here and that is the truth! The choice of micro brews is outstanding and the service is beyond compare. Crystal was our waitress tonight and she is one of the best! She was quick  efficient and extremely personable. She joked with us  made us laugh and was very non intrusive throughout the meal. She truly made the meal even better! You are so lucky to have her as part of your staff!! Thank you Crystal for your incredible personality! You are a jewel!! Good luck with your fantasy football!! We had the full rack of ribs with the root beer glaze with white cheddar mashed potatoes....perfection!! However  the only downside to our wonderful dining experience was your hostess staff. We entered the restaurant and waited for almost a minute before Tyler even looked up and acknowledged us. Really? You don't even make eye contact with someone who comes in the door 6 feet away from you? I find that totally unacceptable. We were seated near the entrance and I had a perfect view of Bailey and Tyler as they seated people and dealt with those patrons who were leaving. Not once did they say goodbye to departing guests. They were too busy chatting with one another. Being in the customer service industry  I find this behavior and actions completely unacceptable. Those two  Bailey and Tyler  certainly make it easy to decide not to come back. Watch who you place as ambassadors to your fine establishment.....
Han L.,Chandler  AZ,15,56,224,10/26/2015,3.0,I think BJ's is a Cheese Cake Factory wanna be but the food (quality & portion) is just no comparison to Cheese Cake Factory which is also by Chandler Fashion mall. So I say unless you are there for the happy hours or 9 dollars specialty drink. For the best of both world  go to Cheese Cake factory!
Chuck T.,Gilbert  AZ,0,12,7,4/30/2016,1.0,"Walked in got a quick soup and salad before a movie. After about 25 minutes server told us "" food should be out soon. We are down a cook"". Really?! It takes a cook to get a house salad and soup? We decided to walk out. 25 minutes just seems like a long time for a soup and salad."
Miss R.,Scottsdale  AZ,78,48,1,7/31/2015,2.0,I shy away from negative reviews as much as possible but this place has been a disappointment on more than 1 occasion. I'm giving 2 stars and if the service wasn't so terrible I'd give more because the food is good. 1st time I went I was greeted and sat by hostess (on the patio). A server never came out for at least 10 minutes. This is unacceptable in the middle of summer in AZ. Water should have been brought by a server or hostess. The service from there continued to be so. Un-attentive to say the least. I mentioned to what I thought was management and a mere apology was given. Gave another chance yesterday. Server took order without writing anything down. Of course when we got our food  the order was wrong. When we addressed her  she attempted to blame my sister. We were never checked on the entire time. Our waters continued to stay empty. I was at least smart enough to sit inside this time. She seemed very attentive to her to other tables and it was mid day on a Thursday  so not a busy time at all. When she finally did check on us  I just said we were ready for our check. She handed it right over. It was the only one in her apron. What if we were going to order more. Just seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out of there. I'm huge on customer service  as much as I like good food  I pay a premium when going out to have good service and this place just doesn't fit the mold...unfortunately.
Diane B.,Hartland  WI,0,8,,3/14/2017,5.0,Our waitress helped make it a 5. We've always liked the food and friendly service  however Melani took it to the next level! Her smile and perkiness  attention to her customers needs and personality can't be beat. As I stated  the food has always been good.
Tristan M.,Casa Grande  AZ,13,3,,9/6/2016,4.0,My wife and I were looking for something different than the usual food court fare and we found it here. My first impression was that the place was clean and well kept. It had a nice atmosphere too. The wait staff was professional  friendly and quick to refill empty beverages and waters. The food was good  not out of this world but good. To put it another way I wouldn't tell someone they had to go out of their way to try it but if they're in the area and were looking for a decent place to eat I would definitely recommend it. My wife had the avocado bacon and cheese sandwich. She enjoyed it I tried a bite myself and thought it was good too. I ordered the black and blue burger. The flavor was good and the portions were exactly what you'd expect at a place like that. All in all a great experience and a great place to check out if you're in the area.
Omari D.,Tempe  AZ,71,170,234,8/30/2015,4.0,Undecided as usual for lunch so when in doubt  a chain restaurant with lots of variety helps me. Like Cheesecake Factory  a lot of menu items which can be overwhelming. Had a great server to help me navigate and provided some good conversation as I was solo! Location and menu items suited for a large or small group and accommodating.
Jim N.,Gilbert  AZ,162,11,1,4/13/2016,1.0,Very good food but very poor service. Not the first time we have had poor service here. This time  it was the worst service we have ever had. We had a table of 5 people starting around 5 PM for a birthday celebration and the restaurant was not busy. I'm assuming that the server Alysha P  was having a bad day. She was very short and almost rude to each in the group. We had to ask her multiple time for more cocktails  water and such. We even waited for a couple of minutes to get silverware napkins and condiments after our food was brought to the table. Nothing was a priority to her. Four of us are self-employed business owners and the 5th person is a restaurant manager. None of us could believe that management has re-trained her or let her on her way out the door. Hopefully better luck nex time.
Sage E.,Tempe  AZ,97,7,1,5/18/2016,1.0,"I went here last night and my experience was awful. My server was inattentive my pizza did not have the items I requested and upon request my server just laughed it off and said ""oops this was my fault I\'ll throw artichokes on the side"" I said no thanks. Then he never refilled my beverage I was without a beerage through my entire main course. The balsamic chicken said it was a chicken breast and it was not the breast also the potatoes honestly taste like they were box mashed potatoes with cheese on them. My server honestly ruined the experience he brushed off every concern I had and it was annoying. We got our check 15 minutes a free we finished. We were waiting on him  not vice versa. Will never ever go again."
Jamie B.,Chandler  AZ,288,404,716,8/30/2015,4.0,I love this place but don't come here enough. There are lots of options that everyone can find something that they like on the menu. Next time I will have to remember to use their app to get on the list to avoid the wait.
Ellen B.,Denver  CO,111,24,33,10/7/2015,4.0,Came here the other night for the first time for dinner and loved it! The menu is very extensive- there's something for everyone. We shared the Mediterranean Tacos as an appetizer and loved them! My boyfriend had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it was great. Perfect dinner spot if you're heading to Chandler Fashion Center. We will be back!
Bobbe H.,Chandler  AZ,15,50,27,12/23/2015,4.0,Fun place to have lunch or dinner. Great for sports watching. Lots of food choices and great choice of beers.
Emily M.,Chandler  AZ,0,6,,11/4/2016,2.0,Had a large party celebrating two birthdays and made a reservation a few days ahead of time with a manager. Called in again to extend my party number and a different manager said I wasn't even put down for a reservation. I'm glad I called or else my party and I would've shown up with no table. When we arrived  we had to wait 25 min even though it was late night on a weekday (it was not busy). During our meal  we were checked on once which is unfortunate because I drink a lot of water and need refills semi-frequently. None of this bothered me until two of my guests had to leave early so they got their check  left cash on the table  and left. Our waitress Laura threw a little fit about how much they did or did not tip. Even though the rest of us tipped normally  her attitude made us all reflect on whether we wanted to tip well or not. She proceeded to drop our cards down on the table for us to go through since she was annoyed. We wanted to put in an additional desert order to make her some more money and she was annoyed because she had already taken an order for us. She forgot to grab my card I was holding up so she was annoyed that she had to come back for it but I mean I don't have to pay if you don't want me to right? In the end  we had to talk to a manager about what is appropriate behavior and conversation to be having in front of customers.
Jeannie C.,Phoenix  AZ,175,14,30,5/6/2015,1.0,"One of the WORST EXPERIENCES EVER. 1. Ordered the cajun pasta but the flavor did not taste Cajun. I had it once before and it was very good. It took a while but I was finally able to wave down the waitress and asked her if there was any way to make it more ""Cajuny"". It came back smelling like dirty sink water & it tasted like straight up salt along with a hint of the dirty sink water  making it completely inedible. 2. My boyfriend asked for extra toasted buns on his crispy jalapeo burger and it came out very soft and un-toasted.. Their excuse for that was that they toasted the underside of the buns more than usual.. what kind of logic is that? The underside of the bun just gets soggy anyway because of the sauce so isn\'t it obvious if someone stresses the fact that they need the buns extra toasted they would do both sides of the buns?3. We were unable to get even one refill due to the extremely long absences of the waitress and my boyfriend even yelled for her when she was 3 feet away and she still wouldn\'t turn around... and the restaurant wasn\'t even loud  the table next to where our waitress was standing even looked at my boyfriend because he was calling for her. The experience was more of a hassle than anything. For the hour we spent at here  30 minutes was spent looking around waiting for the waitress to bring us the check and togo boxes. After the 15 minutes past of waiting for the check my boyfriend kept urging me to walk out on the check with him because he felt like they didn\'t deserve our money but I waited another 15 minutes to pay for this horrible experience... Since when did it take 30 minutes to get a check and togo boxes? Worst of all  it was an extremely slow night  slow enough to see plenty of waiters sitting around and talking for 20 mins. Luckily our waitress took the pasta off of our check so we didn\'t have to pay for the extremely salty  dirty  sink water flavored pasta.Now that I think about it  I should\'ve listened to my boyfriend. This experience  along with 1 burger and 2 appetizers was not at all worth $27. No wonder they call themselves BJ\'s cuz this place BLOWS!"
Chris P.,Gilbert  AZ,128,358,51,7/24/2015,4.0,I dig their pizza and root beer. I do the pepperoni and mushroom with basil tomatoes on top. The root beer is good and House made. Always a good choice even late at night. The staff is not as friendly later  but still a good choice. Give this place a shot.
Chris W.,Chandler  AZ,0,5,,2/27/2016,1.0,The food was good (even though my order was wrong) but the waitress got a group of employees and started looking at my party and started laughing at all of us. she didn't even say she was sorry to any of us tonight. not eating here again because I don't like being laughed at.
K C.,North Las Vegas  NV,0,32,37,6/19/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Our server was great Our food was super slow. Appetizers took an hour but we are a big party we were patiently waiting We had a problem with one of the plates and the manager came out to spoon out plate to make sure what we said was missing wasn't on the plate He mentioned how weird it was when he had just had it and didn't have a problem. I have neverrrrr seen anyone do anything like that. That was so disrespectful  rude  tasteless and no customer service at ALL! Were we treated this way because we are minorities? Not sure but felt so disrespected. We will make sure not to ever come back to another BJ's again. UPDATE BJS IN LAS VEGASMay 2016We received a gift card from bjs and decided to give it another try. It was great. The waitress was super nice. This time around it was inly two of us vs 15.  Our food dis take for ever to come but it wasnt bad. My pizza was not very hot but it wasnt bad. My husbands food was good along with the dessert he got.
Shigeru Y.,Phoenix  AZ,3,260,55,2/21/2016,1.0,There were a massive number of empty tables both inside and on the patio  yet we were told there would be an hour wait. The hostess claimed that she didn't have enough servers to seat anyone. We took our business elsewhere.
Kendra K.,Chandler  AZ,48,10,,7/18/2016,5.0,Food is always great- got my first free pizookie from the new membership- and if you play Pokemon go- they got stops- great service as always.
Toryanni E.,Hoofddorp  The Netherlands,88,329,372,6/29/2013,4.0,I tried 2 of the new bbq menu items this time around and I was not disappointed. The Corn Fritters with the bacon aioli (which I posted a picture of) were super delicious and only $2.95  I was sad that I had to share...The Jallejulah fries (also pictured) where good too  not as spicy as I would have liked but it was definitely a unique taste.I had the grilled Mahi Mahi Mahi tacos (guess what? there's also a picture of these!) off the lunch menu and they were quite good. The tacos came with chips and a small dish of salsa and guacamole. Not a big fan of the guacamole  it was too soupy for my taste. My friend had chicken tenders they looked good but I didn't try them.The lunch and happy hour prices are really good. I love going for happy hour and having the mini pizzas. Plus I'm a rewards member  so I get points for eating there.
Alex D.,The Islands  Gilbert  AZ,131,180,123,6/25/2014,4.0,Good Beer  Good food; not much more I can ask for.  Have yet to have a bad experience here. I'm a rewards member so it pays off since I visit often. Can't review much on wait staff as I always sit at the bar top and have great service. Would recommend.
Keisha T.,Phoenix  AZ,17,7,5,3/23/2016,4.0,This is one of the few places open til midnight in Chandler. We love that. The food was really good and the blood orange sangria is to die for. The service could be better  but it just seemed like they didn't ha e enough staff.
Kyle H.,Casa Grande  AZ,56,30,63,5/16/2016,5.0,I really enjoy coming here after walking around the mall and having a beer and a bison burger this place is really done right good food and the beer is really good  The ale is better than pretty much all beer place's around here.
Chad W.,Phoenix  AZ,509,119,174,6/30/2014,4.0,This mall restaurant had a wide and well thought out selection of beers on tap and a menu that would accommodate any meal  whether you were just wanting a small lunch or a hearty dinner. We sat at the bar so we could have a prime view of the large screen to watch the game  and were met with excellent bar tending service and quick eats. Great spot that I'll be visiting again.
Jason D.,Gilbert  AZ,37,47,7,9/13/2015,5.0,My fiance and I met a friend for a birthday party a few days ago  along with 16 other people. It was my first time visiting this location  or any other one for that matter. The one thing I was impressed by is that with the amount of people that were there  it wasn't as noisy as I thought it going to be. Yes  you did have to raise your voice a bit  but it wasn't to the level of shouting  which is a definite plus. Perhaps it's the high ceilings. Anyway  my fiance and I opted for the appetizer (mozzarella sticks - you really can't go wrong with those) - they were good  but it's the marinara sauce they give you that make them even better! My fiance ordered the bison burger  which I had a bite of and thought it was delicious. My dish  the parmesan crusted chicken  was also quite tasty. I love the sauce they put on it with the sun-dried tomatoes. The reason I'm giving this location five stars is simple:  the service. Our server  Joanna  was amazing. She was very attentive  but not overly annoying. After everyone got their food  my dish still hadn't arrived. She went back to check on it  and apparently  my dish went to another table by mistake  so she had the kitchen rush my dish out and even had the meal compensated without hesitation (I didn't even ask for it). She was very apologetic and sincere about it  which is rare these days. There should be more servers like her. We will definitely be coming back here again.
Chris E.,Gilbert  AZ,0,8,,6/18/2016,1.0,I have been to BJ's about five times....I have ordered the ceaser salad each time with the dressing on the side....EACH AND EVERY TIME THESE IDIOTS DROWN MY SALAD IN DRESSING!!!!!!!!! I am done!!!!! I will never go back to BJ's!!!!!!! Obviously the waiters can't listen to simple requests!!!!!!!!
Mar L.,Tempe  AZ,387,262,9,2/17/2014,3.0,I don't know what I was thinking BJ's was  but not what it is. I thought it was a run-of-the-mill steakhouse  and it's more of a run-of-the-mill brewery. Does this make a difference  you might ask - and yes it does. So  as this will not become a stable of mine  my visit did make me want to come back in the right mindset and the right company. Plowing through brews and sliders - yeah  I can see that happen.OK  so the service is standard  and the food seems very basic and the brews are a bit interesting.. but I did notice that besides having quite a few Pale Ale's and IPA's  every other ale is pronounced to be 'hoppy'. What if I don't want a hoppy beer  nor want the token lager that is the stand-in for the go-to Bud/Miller/Corrs/30for$20 kinds of beer. I guess my options are limited  but I will need to plow through them all before I conclude that BJ's might oversell their product just a bit.I started with the Jeremiah Red  and wasn't blown away. I'd ask more of a Red Ale  and this was way middle of the road. Also very hoppy  even if it suggests being 'Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma'. I do not concur - I think its was too hoppy for a Red Ale. I will have to go hard next time to evaluate their brews. I have a feeling that I will not be all too impressed - but then again I will try to remain unbiased. So where does this leave me? Nah  it's all right I guess.. and I will come back when the time is right.
Tammi L.,Cortez  CO,0,6,,5/9/2016,5.0,This place has phenomenol service! The beer and food is pretty darn good too (we had the new Orleans jambalaya & the cherry Chipotle smoked salmon). But I am leaving this review mostly because I was so blown away by the customer service.... from the hostess  the server  the manager and even the bus boy! Everyone was incredibly kind and went out of their way to accommodate us in having a pleasant experience. Well done guys  THANK YOU!!!
Sed F.,Phoenix  AZ,3,76,47,8/8/2015,5.0,"Very prompt service during happy hour on a busy Friday. My waitress Alysha was super attentive and polite even though she was working a party of over 15 next to me. I went especially for the seasonal Summer ""Watermelon Mojito"" and I ordered a Jalapeo turkey burger. Everything was delicious!"
Courtney S.,Miami  FL,1,1,,12/31/2015,1.0,I have been to BJs numerous times and had great experiences - but I will say if you have a special meal or a football game you really want to watch - DO NOT do so at BJs! I made a reservation with the only request being to watch a playoff football game - so they sat us outside with a table of 10 where there was only 1 TV and no game sound. The only sound was music. We were told the manager said that they couldn't turn the game sound on that night. I was so frustrated that they messed up our plans so badly!
B P.,Peoria  AZ,0,13,,11/7/2015,5.0,"So it\'s been a long time since my wife and I were blown away with a restaurant. First  there was a 20 minute wait for a 2-top in an almost empty place. Our hostess said there were ""a few... problems with staffing."" Her pause  not mine. Our waitress Madeline looked frazzled but she took good care of us and the rest of the section as it filled up around us. The food was great. The service was great. And we couldn\'t have asked for a better time. If the management reads these posts  I urge you not to whip the horses that work..."
Doug T.,Scottsdale  AZ,713,320,1068,12/4/2013,4.0,I came here with my co-workers for a team lunch. We do this every quarter and decided come here cause they can handle large parties and they have a big variety menu. When we got here our table was already setup and once we sat down our server was really quick to provide us with our drinks. I ordered the California Burger. I thought that this was really good. Bursting with flavor. The burger was on a grilled sourdough bread with avocado  green chilies  pepper jack cheese  chipotle mayo  and ranch. Burger was very moist and perfect. It came with shoestring fries. Half the plate was filled with fries. It was a huge lunch meal but really worth it. As for the service  our server was always checking on us. Refilling our drinks and clearing the empty plates. We even had the manager come by to make sure everything was okay. It seemed like they really cared for us. So overall  I would say that we had a really enjoyable time. We had a table over 10 people and the service and food came out in a reasonable time. The only regret was that I didn't order their Pizookie. Those are so good. Enjoy...
Bill G.,Chandler  AZ,12,16,,4/1/2015,3.0,This will likely be our last visit. While we've been generally pleased to this point with both the food and the service (which can often be hit or miss)  I simply cannot understand the constant and unnecessary meddling with items on the menu that have long been staples. You removed the Italian chop salad for an Asian one? Why? The only redeeming thing about BJ's is their craft brewed beers and they're not all too special. So very  very disapponting  guys... but I guess it's to be expected when you're a corporate chain that has little interest in what's good in YOUR location versus what's good in an entirely different state.
Rich S.,Chandler  AZ,0,11,,5/8/2016,2.0,Went to Bj.s with my family for mother's day and it was a disaster  the fish and chips I got were burnt they bought me another but the fries were dry and the fish batter was thick and lousy not to mention the pieces were very small. They gave us free desert because of the fish problem and they gave gave me a pizookie with a burnt chocolate chip cookie.My wife had pizza and she said it was lousy and my son who loves pizza did not eat the piece she gave him. This used to be such a great place to eat but the last few times the quality has gone to crap and it seems everytime we go here it gets worse. I will not be going back for a very long time.
Emily G.,Tempe  AZ,532,431,591,12/2/2013,2.0,"It pains me to be here at HH when Kona is a few feet away offering the tastiest treats for next to nothing. Instead i\'m at BJ\'s for a company HH  trying to make the best of it.The only great thing about their HH is the $4 you-call its. They\'re not you-call-it-wells  they\'re you-call-it-anything  so my smart-ass self ordered top shelf gin with ginger beer. Unfortunately  they didn\'t have my favorite (Hendricks) OR ginger beer  so I caved with Tanqueray on ginger-ale. Sad  but still a damn good deal for $4.We ordered the lettuce wraps and egg rolls at $6 each as a HH special price. Funny thing about HH pricing  you sorta expect it to be the same regular menu item at a discount price (which is why you\'re so ""happy"" to attend). Well  a little investigation lead me to realize that the appetizers on the HH menu are SMALLER than their regular-priced counterparts. The lettuce wrap on HH comes with 3 individual leaves of lettuce with a miniature sample of the meaty sauce while the menu displays the lettuce wraps as 4-6 leaves surrounded by multiple bowls of filling. How fishy.Then the egg rolls appeared. 4 tiny little nubs of fried dough with avocado that tastes like its drowning in mayo. Did I really just pay $6 for this? Is this really a ""deal"". I think i\'ll just have a liquid-gin dinner for HH and call it a day. No thank you."
Kendall B.,Chandler  AZ,9,32,50,7/9/2015,5.0,AMAZING PAZOOKIES. The best is the original chocolate chunk. The small bites and snacks are great for a late night great. All the food is spectacular. My go to treat to celebrate birthdays or just to celebrate the love for chocolate chip cookies with ice cream!
Cindy C.,Phoenix  AZ,117,144,,3/21/2014,5.0,So I met up with a buddy today for a leisurely lunch and had a great time! This is important because I had low expectations based on the Yelp feedback I've read. We got seated outside to take advantage of the great weather and I was pleasantly surprised by attentive and prompt service. We chatted for a while before ordering and got some great suggestions from our server.I've been craving a burger in the worst way. I only have a couple a year and expect a lot from them. BJ's burger came with parmesan toasted buns  tomato  pickles  lettuce  bacon  cheese  and a really delicious homemade.1000-Island dressing! The meat was hi-quality and perfectly cooked.. It came with some yummy wedge fries.....I cleaned my plate!My friend had a wedge salad and a bread bowl with clam chowder. She loved every bite! I was pretty stuffed but she talked me into sharing a trio of pizzookies with ice cream. They were delicious too  especially the peanut butter with vanilla.I was impressed overall and will be back. I think the folks who have rated this place negatively should try it again. It's worth it!
Gigi-kitty K.,Chandler  AZ,0,1,,10/29/2016,3.0,We LOVE this place BUT we came in specifically for the pumpkin ale and were told they'd run out the week before. We've missed it two years in a row now because not enough was made. Make more!!! We'll drink it!!
Rob M.,Tempe  AZ,0,10,,5/1/2016,5.0,AWESOME selection of beer!!!!.. Check it out.... In addition  I had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries and it was BOMB!!
Aubrey L.,Mesa  AZ,4,5,,12/21/2015,5.0,We always have a great experience when we come to BJ'S but I'd like to applaud our server tonight  Mike C. He took phenomenal care of us  he was attentive and genuine. Highly recommended him  and BJ'S in general. Thanks for the awesome date night  and for telling us about the rewards card.
Johnny N.,Queen Creek  AZ,1,25,17,6/19/2016,1.0,Thought it would be a good fathers day to grab some food and a cold beer. I'm familiar with bj's just not this location. We say 1st the bar sheet I kept hearing this very loud thumping noise.. at first I thought it was just a quick kitchen anomaly and would stop.. no such luck it's the server for from they kitchen do you are stuck hearing this annoying thumping every 5-10 seconds.. not a relaxing atmosphere at all. If I do bj's it will not be this location..
Diana G.,Chandler  AZ,26,10,3,3/11/2016,5.0,Every time I have been here I have received great service and the food is always amazing no matter what I order! This is definitely my go to spot for a great meal at a decent price!
Jack K.,Chandler  AZ,0,2,,3/22/2016,1.0,They have nice drafts  decent food  really horrible service. On our last visit the check was on the table while I still had the plate half full and a full glass of beer. I thought it was a restaurant not a fast food joint.There is a continuous pressure on selling more even while you're still eating  yet never enough time to bring water or even refill glasses.I don't remember a time I was able to relax and enjoy a meal here.On several occasions our server made us feel like we should have been grateful she was serving us. Most of them have some sort of off-putting attitude as if they'd rather not be there serving guests.Used to come frequently  even had the app but can't be bothered any more. Restrooms can get really gross looks like no one cares.Luckily the area has no shortage of better places that make sure customers have time to enjoy their meals and drinks.
Tiffani G.,Scottsdale  AZ,421,134,132,1/17/2014,3.0,BJ's is your typical chain brewery I think. It's not quite as good as a 4 Peaks because well  everyone likes a one of a kind over a chain...the good ones any way. I feel like one of the downsides is that their menu is like a novel. I mean my gosh  make a decision here...what kind of food do we want to serve? I don't want to read through a Cheesecake Factory sized menu when I just want to get a beer and good eats. It's not bad food  it's pretty good - nothing above and beyond but also nothing to write home about. I have tried the Grilled Chicken Pasta which was just okay. The second time I went I had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken which was actually pretty delicious. I haven't gone too much into the beer menu as I'm not a huge beer drinker  but the list is actually pretty big. Service was great both times  servers were always very friendly and the place was clean. I'm sure I'll be back here at some point  occasionally it's comforting to know exactly what you're getting in to rather than the unknown. :)
Mike H.,Chandler  AZ,0,63,10,2/14/2016,5.0,Dropped in for early dinner. We had the Asian chicken and a santafe salad. Both were very good. Each a full meal. Service was good. Wasn't too noisy. Enjoyed the experience. Really appreciated the waitress offering us each an ice tea to go. Even joined their rewards club while there.
Coco K.,Chandler  AZ,0,9,,9/9/2015,1.0,The service I received on 4 Sept last Friday at this location (Chandler) was unimpressive. I was even more disappointed in their management. My wife and I made a reservation the morning (11:00 AM) of 4 Sept (Friday) for 16+ people for dinner later that night at 7:00 PM. The host (male) confirmed the reservation (via phone) but when my family along with our friends arrived there later that night  they told us to take a pager and would seat us as soon as possible. When I inquired as to what had happened  the hostess simply stated that somehow our reservation had gotten deleted in the system and when it was put back into the system  the morning shift entered it incorrectly (6:00 PM). The server then stated that the current wait was 50 minutes. I asked to speak to a manager to resolve the issue (as I had 16 individuals w/ their families waiting) and when the manager spoke to us he was less than empathetic in what had happened. His demeanor was less than encouraging  no apology was given  and he stated he was working the issue but we would have to wait. There was no sense of urgency to remedy the situation from management and I got the perception that there was very little interest in correcting the error. Looking around the restaurant  I could easily see that there were vacant tables on the patio (which the manager could have easily offered) regardless if the service would be slow. But no offer was made. Instead  he stated that we would have to wait the current wait time (50 minutes). Having a wife who has been in the hospitality management industry for 10+ years  there could have been multiple ways of recovering the situation: Offered patio seating  or at least somewhere to sit  offered some seating at the bar  maybe a few complimentary appetizers to calm the hungry children  or even some waters at least while waiting in the Arizona heat  vouchers or anything to come back another time... at the VERY least  a sincere apology (especially with a party as large as 16+ individuals). My true disappointment was not that a mistake had happened  but rather how the situation was poorly handled. We can understand there can sometimes be a miscommunication during a shift change  but poor management and recovery should not be accepted. After talking to the less than empathetic manager  my family and party left BJs and went to the Keg where they were glad to have our business. Sadly  that's $700 in sales BJ's lost out on and also grat that their servers missed out on and more importantly  a loss in some loyal patrons. The great thing about all this is- we have found a new meeting place as our regular dinner location  thanks to the Keg. We will look forward to returning there for our regular dinner outings and will look back and laugh at myself and think what a fortunate mistake this was. I would suggest a bit more training for the staff  not just for the hostess stand employees  but for leadership/management more importantly. Staff is only as good as their leader.

Heather H.,Murrieta  CA,14,22,,8/30/2015,2.0,Honestly  I've been here many times and this was one of the worst experiences I've had here. It took the server a good five minutes to acknowledge me and then another five minutes just to bring me my iced tea. During the course of my meal  my glass was empty several times and she had to walk right by my table to get to the kitchen  so I'm not sure why she couldn't refill my glass on one of her many trips or while she was just standing around. Also  she never stopped to check on how my meal was or if the food was alright. Then when I went to pay  I gave her my rewards card and she didn't even bother to give me the points from today's visit. Also  the manager was too busy watching the baseball game on TV to pay any attention to his servers or guests. I'm just very disappointed with this visit.
Kimberly G.,Seattle  WA,150,237,49,6/16/2013,3.0,I have eaten at BJ's a few times when in the area and it has always just been okay. Last night was no different. The beer selection on tap is great and the cocktail menu is pretty good.Service last night was not the best. Our waiter forgot about us a few times throughout the night  and I watched another waiter tell him to check on us before he was once again going to go into the kitchen without checking on us. We ordered two side salads before our entrees and I must say they were a sad excuse for a salad. Iceberg lettuce  a few carrots and watery ranch. Yuck. I ate a little and decided to wait it out for my entre.I ordered a mini bacon cheeseburger pizza and my fianc had the jalapeno pepper jack burger. The first few bites of my pizza were pretty tasty  it had a combination of cheddar cheese  dill pickles  ground beef  bacon and a special sauce. I had eaten it before on a previous visit and really liked it. After the first few bites the pizza seemed very doughy and not cooked all the way through. I might have sent it back but service was quite slow and I did not feel like waiting another thirty minutes. My fianc's jalapeno burger was okay. It was not bad but not great. The fries were very tasty.We did finish off our meal with a chocolate chip pizookie. That is the saving grace to the whole meal. Warm cookie with ice cream mmmmm..... I might be back if it is a late night and I am coming out of a movie. I don't think that I would get to adventurous with the menu. I would stick to beer  apps and a pizookie.
Anthony F.,Mesa  AZ,0,6,1,3/18/2016,5.0,This is one of my favorite restaurants. Great atmosphere and food. The parmesana crusted chicken is the best! I like that i can see all the sports games.
David L.,Lynnwood  WA,25,119,3,11/19/2014,4.0,First  it's a really nice bar. The bartenders and staff are just great! If you love beer  get the sampler and try them out  but the red ale is the best in my opinion!.Having very fond memories of the amazing tuna poke at Lulu's in Lahaina on Maui  BJ's was in for some steep competition. They succeeded in a wonderful take on the dish. The avocado egg rolls made my belly happy as well  and were NOT at all greasy.Very very good.Lots of TVs to watch various sporting events. Lots of fun!
Alexandria D.,Chandler  AZ,60,99,38,1/7/2016,5.0,OH MY GOSH I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! We came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago & have been back like two or three times already! The first time we were there we had great service & the second time we had a very strange composing older lady as our server & that made it kind of awkward for us at times. Definitely recommend pretty much everything there! I love there pazookie original cookie dessert! You also can't go wrong with their burgers  salads  ribs  or appetizers! & THERE PORK IS TO DIE FOR! I can't wait to bring my coupon and go back! Also don't forget to sign up for there rewards system  it's awesome!!! Yay!
Vanessa G.,Scottsdale  AZ,92,184,205,10/3/2014,4.0,This place is a chain. The atmosphere is well constructed  even though it is a bar it can feel very intimate. You are separated into small clusters through out and it doesnt seem as big as the venue is.As for service  they got our order wrong and forgot to put in the appetizers.. before we even had a chance to get upset  the waiter said it would be compted  apologized several times. The manager came by  apologized several times.. wow. I felt really appreciated and the service was great. They do really value their customers!As for food:- I got the Scallops - OH MY GOODNNEESS. So good  these are perfection  and in their EnLIGHTened menu. So one of the healthier choices and very filling.- Like always my eyes are too big for my stomach so I also got the chili. This was alright  nothing out of this world.. and it has a lot of sour cream  so if you hate it as much as i do you will spend several minutes just scooping all of it out. -Appetizer: Stuffed Mushrooms. So good! And fancy.. so great!-My bf got the Hamburger - Now... this is where it all went south. The hamburger was underwhelming  not juicy  not spiced  not anything. It just was a hamburger. Not memorable at all.Solid 4 stars. And dont get a hamburger!
Lauren T.,Tucson  AZ,160,274,24,7/21/2013,4.0,Finally tried BJ's. It is one of those menus like The Cheesecake Factory. Not as bad though  but slightly long and overwhelming. Best part was that I was finally let in on the secret of the Pizookie! YUM!!! I went with the traditional chocolate chip and was not in the least bit disappointed! I could eat those all day....This location: busy  but service was good especially for how busy they were. Food I tried:Avocado Egg Rolls--my favorite! So yummy!Mac and Cheese--my least favorite. Dry and tasteless.Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread--I love anything with goat cheese!Great White Pizza--not bad  not good  did the trick.Pizookie-SEE ABOVE AMAZINGNESSSSSSS
Brooke E.,Gilbert  AZ,21,66,17,1/2/2016,5.0,I have always loved the pizza here. McGregor hears about my less than satisfactory experience at another location  and took it upon himself to take care of us completely. I was overwhelmed with gratitude to his willingness to make our experience over the top awesome! Thanks McGregor!
Puja C.,Queen Creek  AZ,111,28,15,7/17/2014,4.0,Main Points:-Variety of beer and food-Good portions on dinner menu-Great for groupsReview:If you're looking to grab some food outside of the mall's food court  consider stopping into BJ's. They've got a very extensive menu with various types of cuisines  so it's sure to suit everyone in your group or the individual who just can't decide on one food type that sounds good. I've tried several things on the menu in the past  and I've thoroughly enjoyed their signature gynormous potatoes  tasty beer  and melt-in-your-mouth pizzookies. If you're looking for something with a little bit of spice  try their jambalaya - not sure how it fares with authentic cajun cooking  but it hits the spot.I may have to give the lunch menu another try  but I was a bit disappointed with the things I tried today: Chicken quesadilla- hardly any cheese and not enough food for a lunch  Margherita Flatbread - too small and sauce tasted like the diy luncheable pizzas from elementary school  Turkey bacon ham sandwich - just your regular sandwich nothing special  and their Pale Ale chili - no spice and not a very good overall flavor.Despite my lunch experience  I'm giving them a 4 because my past meals have been consistently good. I like the variety of food and beer  good service  my fav dishes and the convenience of the location  and their ability to accommodate groups.
Jenna N.,San Antonio  TX,7,191,12,12/15/2014,4.0,Food was great. We had the avocado egg rolls and pizza! So delicious. Service is a bit slow but it's a huge place. Felt bad for our server because he was running around all over the place. Although you could tell he was exhausted he was always very friendly.
John B.,Provo  UT,69,100,43,12/27/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I got the clam chowder  which was good. Others in our trio got the Cajun pasta dish and a cheeseburger  which they apparently enjoyed. We had to sit outside because the restaurant was so packed  but BJs has nice heaters  so it really wasn't a problem. Our server (Jeff) gave us lots of attention and was quite friendly and courteous. BJs was very accommodating.
Paige C.,Chandler  AZ,0,4,1,8/7/2016,5.0,I love this restaurant! Love the food and desserts! I have had great and fast service every time I've been here  from group events to family dinners. It can be a little bit pricey though. But still a great place to go.
Chris K.,Nottingham  MD,10,96,15,12/20/2015,5.0,Decided to grab a late night dinner. Their steak was surprisingly good and fair priced unlike another steakhouse I visited in Downtown Chandler. Food was spot on. Service was even better. And it's so close to everything I loved it.
Tina M.,Phoenix  AZ,124,288,111,4/17/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,This is not your usual sports bar fare. The Thai Chicken salad is amazing! Juicy chicken  fresh avocado & a delicious dressing on fresh greens. I'm embarrassed to say I ate every bite!You can get the usual items on a sports bar menu but the difference is they take the care to make sure everything is top quality. I haven't had anything here that wasn't fresh and well prepared.The servers are friendly and attentive. I don't give 5 stars easily but this establishmenttakes the time and puts in the effort to deserve it.
Shannie M.,Chandler  AZ,0,4,,3/19/2016,1.0,WAITED! 40mins for a simple mini deep dish & a bacon cheeseburger. The server that brought our food WAS NOT gracious or hospitable  she was so abrupt & discourteous that I felt like a dog or farm animal receiving slops. She never asked if there was anything else that we needed or wanted  she just clanked my plate down w/ what seemed like a pizza from PIZZAHUT & my husbands cold burger w/ fries & quickly turned away. By then  my appetite quickly disappeared & we left. So  if you want to be treated poorly & pay for it w/ your time & money  then I strongly recommend this place for you.
Mark W.,Goodyear  AZ,115,40,9,1/17/2016,5.0,Date night with the wife started great. Only had a 3-5 minute wait (rewards program is awesome & has its privileges) to be seated. We were put in front of an entry/exit door on a cooler evening. Asked to be moved  management tried but to no avail as they were pretty busy. He did  however  turn it into an exit only door to cut down on the amount of times it would be opened  (it only leads to the patio) since there was another enclosed door patrons could use.Server was very attentive and usually appeared out of nowhere to fill water and check on us. She was simply amazing. If you like clam chowder  pay a little bit more and get it in the sourdough bowl.....so worth it! An absolutely wonderful time with great food  good drinks and a wonderful wife!
Morgan E.,Scottsdale  AZ,68,155,23,6/30/2013,4.0,Holy crap  the mac n cheese. My friend Syd had the Club which she gave me a bite of and it was amazing. We each had a different kind of beer  I had the blonde which I hadn't tried before. Delicious. Also- I love the atmosphere  it's open space and seating makes it so you aren't IN someone else's conversation. We sat in the bar area at a table before we saw a movie  and the only negative was how long everything took. They were really packed and only had one server on  so it wasn't surprising but we were really hungry.
Andy G.,Ithaca  NY,244,445,10,1/29/2013,4.0,This is a nice place to relax and have a drink or a meal while you're in the Chandler mall area. It's actually on the mall property  so it's easy walking distance from the mall itself and the nearby Harkins theater. I recommend hitting them for happy hour between 3-7 weekdays and then taking in some shopping or a movie.The menu is rather extensive and most of the offerings are quite tasty. The avocado egg rolls in particular stand out  and they usually have interesting offerings like bratwurst sliders and other bar food. Some of the beers really stand out  and this is why you'd want to visit BJ's in the first place. If they have the seasonal Grand Cru  definitely give it a try  but don't plan on driving anywhere any time soon  as it's a very strong brew (10% abv). The porter and stout are very good. The hefeweizen is a bit watery and underwhelming.
Danielle P.,Stamford  CT,170,302,119,6/2/2013,3.0,I really like going to BJs when I am in town visiting my family. They have a HUGE menu so everyone can get exactly what they want. But much like the Cheesecake Factory  everything on the menu is not great. In my opinion  the pizzas and pasta dishes leave much to be desired. The sandwiches  soups  burgers  salads  and appetizers are very yummy. My favorite is the clam chowder in a bread bowl. So. Good.This appears to be a great place for groups.The staff is very accommodating  and attentive  and the restaurant is very big. Friday and Saturday nights are generally packed with people  understandably so with the good food  relaxed atmosphere  and the beer/drink menu. If possible  I would call ahead or be prepared for wait a bit.As I mentioned before  this place has an extensive beer and alcohol menu. My dad and uncle love this place for the beers  and I love this place for the cocktails. I have not been for happy hour  but I hear it is great. Definitely A-OK place for lunch/dinner in Chandler. I think as far as places go in the area  this is top notch.
Liane G.,Tempe  AZ,72,10,9,3/14/2014,5.0,Let me start of by saying that BJs is absolutely fantastic. The roast beef au jous dip is orgasmic. It is literally an explosion of endorphins in your mouth. The meat is tender  med rare  and the au jous is overflowing with herbs and spices. Ladies  bring a towel with you  because the chair WILL be wet. I hope your men aren't jealous  because believe me  THIS meat will be the best meat you have ever put in your mouth. Each bite of this mouth-pleaser will go straight to your pants area. Seriously. Roast beef dip. Do it
Adam F.,Arizona City  AZ,0,16,,12/13/2015,5.0,Great spot! Took my wife here on a date night. They have a great selection of beers. Their dark beers are amazing
Bridget L.,Phoenix  AZ,158,25,19,3/20/2014,3.0,The service sucked. But the fish tacos and Mac & Cheese did not. Our server never smiled  checked on us once  I had to ask twice for water  and never got a refill. Usually  I would avoid us too  but my kids were even behaving today!! I love BJs. I hope this is a one time bad time.
Holly C.,New York  NY,405,1256,5,4/10/2013,3.0,3.5 starsNice ambiance  okay food  good beer on tap. We went for reverse happy hour ($2 off of shareable apps  half off pizza). We tried the avocado egg rolls  ahi poke  and nachos. The egg rolls were pretty good but everything else was okay.
Kara L.,Chandler  AZ,30,20,9,6/20/2015,3.0,If you want beer and/or dessert come here. The food is mediocre. Nothing special there. The only reason we really come is for the beer and pizookie. My husband loves the many types of beer they have. I love the warm cookie and sweet ice cream.
Christine L.,Chandler  AZ,49,155,17,6/24/2014,5.0,Love this place. Awesome food and a lot of different drinks to choose from. You can order pricey wine  or a good local beer. Their is also very good and always well done every time. Good place to hang out with friends  not such a family place  but definitely friends. Love the atmosphere as well  they display their drinks in a very cool way.
Jazzmine R.,Chandler  AZ,0,14,3,4/27/2015,2.0,I've had two negative experiences here all due to service. Food is decent but not good enough to make me want to come back. Mediocre at best.
Amy B.,Rochester  MI,540,1168,303,5/6/2012,4.0,After a full day of shopping and going out  my mom and my friend Austin were starving! We were down in the Awatukee/Chandler area doing some shopping at Ikea  and decided we needed something to eat stat. We didn't feel like driving very far  so we circled through the mall to see what we could find.We decided on BJ's as none of us had been there before and the menu looked really good from the outside. Its a beer brewery  but seems to have a really good menu of food items when eating here. We got seated right away and our server was a real nice gal who answered all our questions.I went with the roast beef sandwich Au jus. It came with white horseradish and was delicious! My mom went with the tomato bisque soup and ceaser salad  and my friend Austin ate the bacon cheeseburger with some fries. OMG food was so good!Water and beverages were filled quickly without being asked  and everyone here was happy. I would love to come here and drink  as they have an awesome drink menu  but since I was driving everyone all over town AND we were with my mom  I guess I'm going to have to come back another time and get my adult beverage on here!I will say  the only negative thing I have to say about this place was that it was freezing inside! It was so cold that my mom had to go outside to warm up. It was quite cold  but I was able to stick it out  but when my mom was outside warming up  so befriended another customer who was outside trying to warm up too!
Chris M.,Gilbert  AZ,15,31,8,9/25/2015,5.0,First of please note  I'm a sucker for any place that has brewhouse in their name. That being said I do dine here at least once a month. The beer selection is very good with both house selections and guest brewers available. The food alone would probably only rate 4 stars but the entire experience lifts them to a 5. Service has always been good and there are a couple servers that are exceptional. Even when dining in the bar  i have no complaints. Their menu may be a little too big for me  but I'm pretty much a burger guy any way. I will say their thin french fries are the bomb.
Tabbatha C.,Commerce  TX,101,7,,10/15/2015,3.0,The menu is massive.  Great atmosphere and very clean restaurant. I ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan.  The chicken Parmesan was very tasty but just not enough of the sauce on the plate.  The chicken tortilla soup was fantastic!  However  I did not care for the house Italian dressing. It was too vinegary for my taste.  The ranch dressing was much better!  A little pricy.
Jozlyn F.,Tucson  AZ,0,3,1,2/12/2015,5.0,Andrew was a great server! Even introduced us to the rewards card! Will definitely be back
Ellen P.,Tempe  AZ,2,1,,5/20/2016,1.0,Terrible  no  no attention or service after 10:30. Servers walk by you and ignore you  it's happened numerous times. We will not go back!
Joe K.,Scottsdale  AZ,0,27,,3/1/2014,2.0,My family and I tried this place last night and I was disappointed. First  the menu reads like Chili's or an Appleebee's  in which this place offers everything under the sun. Experience tells me this is not a good sign. Second  as suggested  the food was sub par. I tried their specialty deep dish pizza and it just tasted like a pizza from Pizza Hut. My daughter ordered the Mac and Cheese and it just average. As for the beer  it was actually good. I wouldn't mind hitting up this place for Happy Hour  but if you are looking for a quality brewery to eat at  try Four Peaks or San Tan.
Kent B.,Gilbert  AZ,0,2,,10/25/2015,4.0,Ok  so when we first went  we did not have a good experience  but the Manager reached out to us and went out of her way to invite us back  and we had a really good time. I would now recommend this place!
Evan B.,Tempe  AZ,259,543,1787,1/28/2010,4.0,Great beer made on site  and some unique deep dish pizzas make for a great happy hour and reverse happy hour. Despite the recent rise in the price of the mini pizzas the half off deal at happy hour is hard to beat. The deals on the beer are not the best  but they quality makes up for it. I really like the spinach artichoke pizza  Imagine taking a pizza and using a creamy artichoke spinach dip in lieu of tomato sauce. That is one rich deep dish pizza. Couple with a tatonka stout and it is one great meal to indulge in. Some of their other great beers are the Jeremiah red. As the name implies it is a red Irish beer. Usually there is a Belgium seasonal high gravity beer whose flavor and alcoholic punch is are to beat.For happy hour beers are $1 off mini pizzas are 1/2 off and most appetizers are $2 off. There is some deal on well drinks  but then why come to a brewery to drink anything other than beer? If you find your self feeling the effects of the beer too quickly the potato wedge fires make for a great sponge to soak up some of the happy juice in the beer.Don't forget you can get a growler (1/2 gallon) of beer to go!
Cris N.,Phoenix  AZ,58,532,382,1/23/2014,2.0,Service  especially after normal dinner hours is INCREDIBLY bad/slow/non-existent.Sadly the happy hour food is 'happy hour sized' which means it's not a deal at all.No TV sound.No TVs on patio.Should have many more TVs behind the bar instead of the stylish but not-functional/useful towers/back-lit shelves of extra liquor bottles. The architect got away with something not in bar-goer's best interests.
David S.,Phoenix  AZ,51,186,45,1/5/2014,4.0,BJ's is a pretty great place. It's a chain  but don't let that turn you off. They have a large  delicious menu  and a selection of both on-site brewed  locally-brewed  and general beers. It's got a nice atmosphere  so would be suitable for a business lunch  date  or just a trip with friends.This location is in a plaza with a large mall  theater  and a ton of other places  so it's a great place to go  have a couple brews  and then do some shopping or see a movie!
Tim Y.,Chandler  AZ,35,1,,1/9/2016,1.0,We were seated as soon as possible  services started out great and she was quick to serve us our drinks. I ordered a rare burger  I rarely eat burgers but I like rare  she took all of our orders and left. We received our food and I was given a mid well burger. I asked her to remake my burger  she was very courteous and said she asked them if it was a rare. I get the second burger  again mid well. At this point I don't want anything else and send it back  to which she says there's a policy of cooking as close to rare  despite being mid well and the second time I've asked. The manager comes to talk to me and I explain her response and he says she was wasn't clear  and FLAT OUT tells me and my friends the kitchen crew isn't good enough to cook a rare burger. Like  blatantly says he has an incompetent staff. I work in food service and have never heard of any manager ever saying basically his staff isn't up to snuff to cook a 5 oz patty rare. He comped the burger and as soon as we got our checks  I paid cash. The waitress gives me change and shorts me 5 dollars. I ask for the manager and he comes by and is somewhat rude about his approach. I work in this industry  I know sometimes you have an off day  but I received bad food  bad service  and bad response. I will not be returning to this company  I had high hopes but left with a sour feeling of BJ's.
Brandon H.,Chandler  AZ,13,24,,2/6/2014,5.0,There are a lot of bar and grill restaurants  so what makes BJ's stand out?Service: The hostesses and servers are always friendly and willing to answer questions about the extensive menu. They always make me feel like a welcome guest.Beer: They brew their own beer  and each type I have tried has been pretty good. They also have a respectable selection of other beers  as well as wines and cocktails.Food: I am always impressed at how consistently good the menu items are. They serve lots of different types of food  and I have yet to find a weak link. The jambalaya I had yesterday was extremely delicious. It had meat or vegetable in every bite  and it was large enough for me to spread over lunch and dinner. Other hits include the calzones  pizza  burgers  pasta  and sandwiches.They seem to be everywhere nowadays  but don't miss BJ's assortment of Pizookies. Get the original  or indulge yourself with the triple chocolate.Ambiance: It is a large dining room with a high ceiling  so it's never that loud. The decor is modern and classy  making it a suitable place for just about any occasion.Value: The portion sizes range from large to huge. Lunch specials start at $6  and regular prices are very fair.This location is right next to the Harkins movie theater  and it makes a great place to stop after seeing a flick.
Christine V.,Chandler  AZ,0,21,3,9/4/2015,4.0,BJ's is my Go-To restaurant for ALL occasions! They have great food  great ambiance  great service and cater to the night owls!
Stephanie V.,York  ME,41,319,115,4/14/2015,3.0,Very  very convenient for large parties. Very accommodating. The staff was fantastic. Food was....ok. Mixed drinks were below expectations. Horrible  horrible parking! The restaurant is a little difficult to find if you're not familiar with this extremely large area of stores and restaurants. Apparently  this area is very popular. The closest lot is for many popular businesses.
Devashree C.,Tempe  AZ,0,6,5,7/31/2015,4.0,Gr8 place for drinks and food. Open till mid- night so if u r hungry n looking for a decent place to eat with less crowd  this is the place. Chicken wings r very light and not too much sauce. Must try - Pizookie
Preston S.,Oklahoma City  OK,162,178,32,8/14/2013,4.0,Came here of my Birthday dinner with my girlfriend. I haven't been here since probably they opened way back in the day. It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision.There was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties  bacon  cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges  another tip from the girlfriend  they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one.I ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it  they don't make it until you order it  it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here.Overall  I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back. I also really like their in house beer. I had the Scottish ale and it was really good. I would like to try more of their different beers next time.There will definitely be a next time. This was a great Birthday dinner capping off a great day.
Andrew L.,Chandler  AZ,0,3,,7/18/2015,1.0,BEWARE of your take out orders. Double checking is a MUST. Ordered a French Dip sandwich for take out and the staff decided to hold the Au jus sauce. Nothing quite like a dip sandwich with no Dip. Careless staff.
Marci A.,Chandler  AZ,0,16,,7/11/2015,2.0,So disappointed. I used to love this place and have always had good service. Today we sat about 10-15 min w/ out drinks 2 times our drink order was wrong and we waited over 35 min for food. Was busy but not crazy crowded. Waitress was not attentive.
Emilie F.,Chandler  AZ,34,12,25,1/5/2014,5.0,I absolutely love this place! Beers are amazing there  the Piranha Pale Ale is definitively my favorite. Food is also great  I tried several things on the menu and I never was disappointed. Their lunch specials are very good deals. Refill soups and salads.
Eric S.,Scottsdale  AZ,1,33,17,4/30/2015,1.0,Stay away. Had to send back to kitchen 3 times a very simple order. Fully discontinued diet root beer. Not impressed.
Katie S.,Chandler  AZ,13,65,19,3/4/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I love the food here! I can't complain about any of it. My son  who may be the world's pickiest eater  loves the kids chicken fingers and smiley face fries. He even asked to go to dinner here... that is HUGE! Again everything we have eaten has been so good! However.....Slooooooooooow service. A couple of times coming here it has been slow  even the San Diego location has super slow service too. Ugh! When you dine with little kids  like us  slow service is the worst. Will we keep going back? Yes... but if we keep experiencing the slow service we will bring it to a managers attention.
Sopheak S.,San Jose  CA,459,149,149,7/12/2011,3.0,I was pretty disappointed with our visit here  we were expected so much more. The food was actually pretty good. We got the appetizer sampler combo and there was plenty of food on it. The avocado eggrolls are the best! I was not a fan of the california club flatbread appetizer pizza. I like the texture of the crust  but not a big fan of the toppings. I did not think the aioli that was drizzled on it went well with the pizza. But  you may like it because my girlfriend loved it.The big disappointment was actually the beer surprisingly. i actually enjoyed my hefeweizen very much. Light  full-bodied and flavorful. The red I tried wasn't very good however. My girlfriend's stout was a huge disappointment. It was actually one of the worst stout we have ever had. Not a lot of flavor and had a weird aftertaste. I actually had better experiences with the BJs in California more  I don't know why. Each chain is a little different I guess.
Dia B.,Plymouth  MI,406,100,133,4/22/2013,4.0,"Great place for good food during HH! I invited my picky friends here and they loved the food! Yes yes yes  they have an ""enlighted"" delish menu. BIG thumbs up for that. Menu is similar to that of Cheesecake Factory? super long w/so many choices. We had the shrimp lettuce wraps on the patio and Chicken ala fresca with veggies (minus rice). It was prepared exactly as asked. One friend had the burger grill which looked super yummy...They even have a ""light"" version of the draft for you beer consumers ;) Overall? Dont let the name fool you  this place is good for a really nice  clean  healthy  fun and chilaxin time. Enjoy!"
J M.,Avondale  AZ,0,5,,6/24/2014,1.0,I have visited this Bj's location twice in the last two weeks. But each time I have visited there was no host at the door to greet me and or my campanion. The employees seem to busy to say hello or even acknowledge it's customers. It takes far to long to be greeted and or seated. During my last visit I ordered a drink  deep dish pizza and asked for water. However  in my hour and half visit the water never arrived and I was not offered a refill even though it was included. The taste of the pizza was fair but seem to lack sauce. So  I asked my hard to track down waiter about the sauce and he offered to bring a side of it to the table. That was a nice gester  but it would have been nicer to dip my warm pizza into warm sauce instead of sauce that was very cold seeming to have come straight from the refrigerator. I would not recommend this Bj's is you are looking for attentive service and hospitality. They continue to fail in both of those areas.Sincerely 
Khoa N.,Chandler  AZ,131,72,2,9/28/2014,3.0,Beer was good. Service wasn't horrible but it was slow. Maybe cause there wasn't many customers in the restaurant. Food was alright. Burger was really dry. I actually had to use a ton of katchup. Maybe cause my waitress didn't ask how I wanted my burger and they just make it well done. But pazookie was good.
Claudine F.,Chandler  AZ,15,98,208,3/21/2013,4.0,Great beer! If it was the beer by itself I were rating  bj's would get 5 stars.The blond and piranha pale ale are my favorites. Food is good  but service is hit or miss(never actually had terrible service  however only once had fantastic service). I go for the beer! And you should too!
Shayna J.,Gilbert  AZ,0,33,,1/17/2016,4.0,Menu has a good selection. Love the chicken and tortilla soup. Ahi salad good but could use a little more ahi for $15. Would definitely be back.
David C.,Oakland  CA,0,11,1,3/2/2015,2.0,Ended up at BJ's based on a recommendation that their pizzas are really great. Not sure I agree... :)
Melissa F.,Gilbert  AZ,20,26,20,1/4/2015,5.0,I love BJ's Brewhouse! They have it all; great service  a wide variety of beer selection  excellent food in appetizers and entrees  and a beautiful restauran. I have rarely ever waited to be seated and their service is fast. I like to order the Harvest Hefeweizen  it had great flavor and is spicy enough for my taste. We always order their chicken wings - I like the hot and spicy sauce. My favorite entree that I always get without fail are the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos  they're delicious  light and refreshing. I have loved everything I've eaten here and will definitely return.
Cole L.,Mission  KS,2,20,,8/30/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Although I was contacted by customer service and offered a gift card to return in hopes of a better experience - which of course I accepted - they never actually sent the gift card. It would have been better for them to never even offer  if they had no follow through plans. Now I not only had a less than impressive experience at the restaurant  but now I also have a poor impression of their corporate office as well.
Xi L.,New York  NY,174,478,176,2/14/2013,5.0,This is my fav Chandler  AZ restaurant for good reason. Amazing pizza and amazing cali chicken sandwich and AMAZINGGGG PIZOOKIES  too bad my north east friends have no idea what the hell a pizookie is but this is the shit. The best thing to grace the designation of dessert is the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Great prices too this place really knows how to get you to come back.Relatively quick service on balance  lots of TVs for watching games. I haven't had the beer yet but its a brewery so I'm sure its good.
Anna S.,Phoenix  AZ,122,57,51,11/12/2014,4.0,Good food!! Prices are pretty good  I also enjoy the atmosphere it's a pretty restaurant. They have a lot of choices on the menu  good amount of beer on tap and TVs to watch the game in a not obnoxious environment.
Mitch G.,Maricopa  AZ,112,263,419,9/8/2011,4.0,Started with a wedge just to pick something simple. Theirs is really good because their blue cheese is savory blue. Their root beer is smoothe too.I believe that I may need to re-visit the place soon so that I can really say more about this that does not just sound stereotypical. What I recall is that I loved the food and that there were some service faux pas. So  I want to give it another go. Yelp lovers...bear with me. I usually do not wait so long to follow up on my reviews that I start. But I can confirm a really good wedge.
Clinton P.,Chandler  AZ,397,105,48,9/10/2014,4.0,Our favorite Friday date night spot before our movie..The Happy Hour specials are and selections are vast and the atmosphere is great surrounded by tv's. The service has always been top notched and the wait time is never over 20 minutes.
LT S.,Columbia  SC,13,55,120,9/2/2014,4.0,Great staff. Well taken care of. Food was good. I'd come to this location again.
Boom Y.,Mesa  AZ,17,154,20,12/6/2014,4.0,The food was good not great. I had the black and blue Burger which was good but smaller than expected. Bloody Mary was good not great. Coffee was good too. The reason why it went from a standard 3 stars to 4 stars was our server Cassie. She was great. Fast  prompt  professional  and just made us feel at home. BJs needs to hire more of her kind.
T A.,Scottsdale  AZ,0,90,,11/11/2013,2.0,I ordered the avocado roll as usual but this time it was complete mush and have the worst a flavor ever this has always been my favorite dish and I always order it...as a main dish I ordered the barbecue beef sandwich .....the bread was hard  as a rock the cheese wasn't melted and the beef was overcooked and crunchy this was terrible food at this restaurant this time I won't be back.  this BJ Brewhouse was the most disappointing I have ever been to.
Claudia B.,Phoenix  AZ,23,29,10,12/11/2014,4.0,Loved it ! appetizers were great tried the sampler. Also I ordered the shrimp scampi primeria (I know that is not the right spelling) But I had so much had to get a to go box. It was great I will be going back
Phoebe M.,Gilbert  AZ,55,101,12,10/4/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I tried their Pumpkin Ale Beer last night it was really good! Pizza was good!
Lisa C.,Scottsdale  AZ,104,40,1,8/29/2013,5.0,My 2nd time at BJ's was last week. This is a busy business  but has adequate seating between the bar  the huge and beautiful restaurant and outside patio seating. We waited around 15-20 minutes on a busy night  but definitely worth it.Sometimes you go places and the menu is so small that it's either really easy or really hard to make a decision. Not the case with BJs! The menu is practically a bedtime storybook  which is awesome because you get to decide from a huge array of dishes  but also a pain because you want to eat everything  as in the case of myself! Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wonton tacos for an app and he enjoyed them. He had the lighter option pork chops and enjoyed those as well. I had a burger and fries and it was very good. Service was good  too! Another great thing is the dessert menu  which has a lot of good options  especially more than the average restaurant. (I'm not lying! See here: bjsrestaurants.com/menus). Opted for the Baked Beignet  but they were out of it  so 2nd choice was the Oreo Cookies N Cream Pizookie! It was suuuuper delicious. I joined their rewards club and always get e-mails for deals  so I suggest signing up  it's worth it! Cannot wait to go back  just wish it was closer to my place!
Shy A.,Portland  OR,261,1023,147,5/8/2011,3.0,I remember coming to this location after a long day at work for HH. Not much has changed. The food choices are still extensive....lots of good beer on hand and the service is still as solid as ever. This is probably my favorite location out of this chain just because over the years  they have been consistent and that's a difficult thing to find nowadays. I've always liked their fish tacos and calzones. You really can't go wrong here.
Richard R.,Phoenix  AZ,187,452,,7/19/2010,2.0,The Beer is good  most of the food is ok  but I have a big issue with BJ's. They advertise their pizza as Chicago style deep dish. When you order one  you'll know right away why there isn't a single location of this chain in Illinois. The Pizza is more like something I'd expect to have ordered at Pizza Hut than anything I've had growing up in Chicago.Have a beer here before seeing a movie next door. Other than that  there's way better places to eat in and around Chandler Fashion Center Mall.
Andrea R.,Chandler  AZ,126,9,3,5/23/2014,1.0,"Stopped in around 4:30 today and sat in the bar area to get the HH deals. After waiting at our high top table for about 15 minutes  a manager stopped over to see if we had been waited on. We told him ""no"" and he ran off to grab some menus. When he came back  he assured us one of his servers would be over right away to take our order. Since it wasn\'t busy  we figured this would be true. About another 10 minutes went by without being acknowledged by a single staff member  so we decided to leave. We headed over to Firebirds  where we had exceptional service and excellent HH drinks."
Michelle L.,Garden Grove  CA,290,127,117,5/7/2013,3.0,Food was good. But I don't feel like our server paid much attention to us until we had to call out excuse me a few times. I came with my niece and I myself look pretty young so I felt like she didn't care much about us cause she thought we were just kids or something. Lol. But nonetheless I'll probably be coming back to try other items  hopefully I won't have that server again!
Paul R.,Clarksville  TN,7,12,4,12/7/2014,4.0,Only eaten here a few times but really enjoy it. Great drink selection and good service. Nice clean restaurant. Try the jambalaya!
Renata P.,Hoover  AL,182,277,9,11/6/2010,2.0,"I guess I shouldn\'t have high expectations for a chain  but I was quite disappointed in this place. Went for happy hour with some friends who apparently like coming here (not sure why though). Although I will say that the service was awesome  the ""good"" ends there. The food  meh. We had some apps including calamari (kinda tough)  spinach dip (I\'ve had better)  and the avocado rolls (the best out of the 3). Not super impressed with any of it. The drinks  they were made well  but at $4.75 for WELL on HAPPY HOUR - it really didn\'t make me very happy at all. Next time I will go somewhere else for happy hour where the food and drink prices really do make me happy."
Gary C.,Chandler  AZ,0,22,,10/7/2014,5.0,Cool atmosphere. I like sitting at bar with huge TV during sports. Their pizza is one of the best I have had. Salads are good . Jumbalaya is awesome. Menu is huge and I haven't had a bad thing yet.
Mizz jazzi ladi L.,Chandler  AZ,12,13,2,7/21/2012,5.0,"I do my ratings and reviews based off of Customer Service  Quality  Taste  and portion size of the food and drinks  and the cleanliness and style of the restaurant.....This is by far a new favorite place for me and my husband..... Me  my mother  husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw ""Brave"" Great Movie) Anyhow  lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean  the setting was very romantic  it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families.... We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late Monday nite it wasn\'t too busy so  our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy.... The waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers  salads  pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don\'t drink so unfortunately I can\'t give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they\'re Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing  very tasty  the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet  it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But  our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip) So on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone\'s dish)The food was Hot  freshly made  and very flavorful.... My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment.... The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette  red wine  mustardy  type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn\'t instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color..... Now my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and tasty...... The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal....Last but not least  I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green  fresh  crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about..... Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing....."
Matt K.,Gilbert  AZ,61,33,2,3/14/2014,5.0,"We were at a fund raiser and they were handing out this amazing chicken salad with all kinds of fresh and delicious ingredients. We asked where the salad was from and we were told BJ\'s. So  after the fundraiser  we head over to BJ\'s. We were told that there was a 15 minute wait so we sat out on a bench right outside of the restaurant. The dancing water show is really cool to watch and helps quickly pass the time. After a few minutes of waiting  a waiter came out and offered us a sample slice of pizza. Wow! That was the best  melt-in-your-mouth pizza my taste buds have ever been introduced to! Now  I had a serious dilemma! I was there for their yummy salad but the pizza was so awesome that I wanted the pizza too. But  I didn\'t want to leave 20 lbs heavier. When we sat down  my wife and I ordered a beer...the root kind. Amazing! If you like root beer  this place has a very smooth and great tasting ""homemade"" root beer. I ordered the Chicken Barbecue Salad (I think that what it\'s called) and sure enough  it was just as good as it was at the fundraiser. The atmosphere was great too! My wife and I were hypnotized by the brightly lite bottles on display at the bar. When we were finished with the meal  we were really bummed that we were full. We wanted to get Pazookie! So  our waiter went the extra mile and made it portable. Yes  Pazookie to go was awesomely delicious even if you eat it for dessert at home. If you\'re in the Chandler area and you need some excellent food. Try out BJ\'s!"
Nicole G.,Phoenix  AZ,311,143,525,11/6/2012,4.0,BJ's might not be a Mom and Mom/local establishment  but when you've found yourself at a ubiquitous Shopping Center/Movie Theater and you're hungry...it's more of an oasis than say  Sbarros? But  I digress...The menu is crazy varied- You want something with an Asian flair  Mexican  or Italian? They've got it all --- Plus nicely crafted brews. Oh  and the notorious pizzookie.Ask the servers what they would recommend. They're more familiar with menu...and I have yet to be steered wrong direction.
A K.,El Dorado Hills  CA,44,309,18,1/15/2013,4.0,Wanted to have a nice ambiance and good food while on the a business trip here.Found BJ location quite nearby and it didn't disappoint. I hadn't try there sandwich before so gave a shot for the chicken club sandwich with thin fries. I have to say the bread and chicken used is perfect combo with just the correct seasoning. I also tried the italian soda - orange flavor  it was yummy and free refills :)
Shontel E.,Chandler  AZ,1,5,,10/12/2014,4.0,They have the best lunch specials. There unlimited soup and salad is the best. Can't beat the price. There pazookie is yummy.
D J.,Chandler  AZ,1,90,38,3/23/2015,1.0,I now know what the B in BJ's stands for...Bland. Calamari had no taste even with the salt and pepper I added. Sent that back. My bacon cheese burger was dry and bland too. Didn't send it back just got a box and brought it home. 1 star because my pink lemonade was good
Chris O.,Chandler  AZ,43,19,,11/20/2011,3.0,5 stars = The environment was great. There is a good view of a television from every table. That is often a problem with sports bars with large dining areas.4 stars = The food was above average. I had the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was very good. Well seasoned and the food was cooked just right. Only complaint is there was too much meat and not enough rice. Wasn't mixed perfectly but still good.3 stars = The menu is too random. Like they haven't decided what type of food they are going to master. Because of this the food is different every time I come here. The food depends on which cook is cooking which meal. 2 stars = The server was awful. The only reason I am giving the server a 2 is because the server delivering the appetizers and food was very pleasant. Our server tried to remember the order but forgot and had to come back and ask. She did not refill drinks at all. She actually came by several times and looked at the empty glasses and ignored it. She was too busy talking with other servers to pay attention to her tables. 3 stars = Total Review I will try this restaurant again.
Deanna K.,Chandler  AZ,10,19,7,7/2/2014,4.0,My dad loves coming to BJ's restaurant when he visits from Michigan. Today I decided to try something new  garlic Parmesan wings... And I am very happy I did. They were delicious and I got 10 of them! My father had the mahi mahi and was very pleased with it as well. I love that no matter what I eat  it's always amazing!
Cj L.,Chandler  AZ,1,11,15,10/24/2014,2.0,Good food and great place to eat with family  friends  and coworkers. I did go there a few months back and in took 45 minutes to get my drink order taken.
Brian B.,Chandler  AZ,0,6,,12/8/2014,2.0,"After a day of shopping at Chandler Fashion we decided to stop in  watch the Cardinals game and relax with good food and exceptional beer. Just prior to arriving at BJ\'s our 7 y.o. daughter wanted some pretzel bites from Wetzels and we also decided to get some pigs in a blank for my mother-in-law. We walked into the restaurant where the manager very rudely and loud enough for other patrons to hear tell us we could not bring food from other ""restaurants"" into ""her"" restaurant. Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred  we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside  not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our ""contraband"" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers. On an up note the food and libations were excellent; the service was fantastic and I can only hope that the manager gets a scholarship to charm school prior to our next visit."
Jake B.,Chandler  AZ,11,18,,11/24/2012,5.0,The family and I love this place  as does anyone I've taken there. First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious. Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot. The fish tacos are fantastic-- it says a lot about a place that every time you go  everything you try  is just great. You'll pay a little bit  but it's worth it.
Alonzo V.,Tempe  AZ,0,19,1,7/11/2014,4.0,First time here after looking at it for years. Was a great experience  will def be back
Adrienne K.,Phoenix  AZ,109,16,1,12/6/2012,4.0,"My man had a wild hair to go here tonight and so we went. We both ordered top sirloin  but his came with a bleu cheese butter sauce on top. Mine came with no toppings  and the waitress didn\'t offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done  one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it  n\'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back  he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know  the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh? Also  I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect  albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium  and it came out with no pink. Huh?All in all  a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend  they\'re usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we\'ve dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the ""Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad"" and highly recommend it if you\'re into that kind of dish. But if you order steak  be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could\'ve played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious.No other snafu\'s tonight  except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated  my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up  ladies....actually  WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us  giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot). This stuff happens and it\'s like eh  whatever  who cares. But these details do kind of dampen the ambiance. Really love the large selection of everything! Iron out the deets  BJ\'s Brewhouse!"
J P.,San Antonio  TX,1,380,,4/13/2013,2.0,Beer is ok.Food...meh.After watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best. BJs is no exception to this rule.The menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread. It was supposed to have tomatoes  cheese and sausage. Tomatoes  yes. Cheese  yes. Sausage...not so much. There were a few (and I mean a few  sausage piece like substance on the flat bread  but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage.As for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts. Overall not a good effort.So assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are  in all likelihood  mediocre also.
Michael T.,Phoenix  AZ,6,51,,8/6/2015,5.0,My wife and I ate there last weekend. We were seated immediately. The food variety is quite large and everything we ordered was really good. They make about 9 different beers and the one I ordered was quite good. Service was prompt and attentive despite the restaurant being quite full. I would definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to other people. The one down side is that they do not offer any coffee other than just plain old brewed - no lattes  etc. They should raise their game on this score. Prices are reasonable. Lots of families eating there  but no rowdy children.
Kimo K.,Phoenix  AZ,22,240,45,4/22/2015,4.0,I have been here two times now. The first time was over a year ago when my GF took me there for lunch. We enjoyed it but I do not remember what we ate. Today  we went for lunch again since BJ's sent my GF a birthday coupon for one free meal. So we went and she had two chicken tacos in pita bread with chips and salsa. The chicken tacos  especially in pita bread was super delicious or so she said. The chips were fast food quality but the avocado dip and the salsa were very good. I ordered their double brewmaster deluxe burger -- that is two 5 oz. patties with two slices of cheese  bacon  onions  tomato slices  and lettuce -- it comes with a boatload of fries. It was very good. A side note --- the have a half pound bacon cheese burger that has essentially the same ingredients but with only one slice of cheese and an 8 oz. patty. Why would anyone order that for the same price as my double brewmaster deluxe burger??? We ordered two soft drinks too. They gave her a birthday cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for her birthday. We were stuffed and the food was good. I was impressed  especially with the birthday coupon.
Venchenzo M.,Gilbert  AZ,0,3,3,7/4/2014,1.0,Very sad service.. took 45mins too receive water and no help too order food. The waitress excuse was that she was the only working tables. No team help 3 guys was just talking with no care too help out.. the menu is like a book with very sticky pages way over price and I would never go back..
Kiersten M.,Fort Rucker  AL,32,5,3,12/29/2013,4.0,After being gone for two years  I was extremely excited about coming back to this restaurant and extremely disappointed to find the most hateful hostess waiting to seat me. There was not a welcoming smile or even look when she asked number of party. She then explained how to find our table and told us to go sit and she would bring the menus along. First impression of one of my favorite past times was horrible  however  the server was amazing and the food was delicious. Must try the honey-crisp chicken salad!
Lara E.,Chandler  AZ,40,29,67,11/3/2011,5.0,We had the best service ever!!!!!!!! We sat on the patio and our waitress was Taylor. She was so attentive  we got our food right away and of course it was delicious!!One thing that was very odd was that we wanted to speak to her manager to tell her what great service we had  then the manager came out and acted like we were wasting her time. It was the strangiest thing????? Just not sure if she wasen't interested in what we were saying  or she had other things that she was doing.So I would give Taylor 5 STARS  and the manger 1 STAR!!!!
David H.,Queen Creek  AZ,0,74,,5/14/2014,4.0,Really good brewhouse and quality food.It is a wide spread chain but they have it down well. They have above average beers (Tatonka Stout) and their seasonal are usually awesome (especial the Belgian based ones).All the food seems to be really good  sides  pizzas  deserts (pazookie)
Dana N.,Mesa  AZ,234,15,1,6/30/2011,4.0,After hearing so much about BJ's  my brother and I went last night along with our pastor friend who lives just down the street. We got the fried artichoke as an app  which was very good. I had a baked potato with chicken and broccoli which was smothered in cheese and my brother had a chili cheese burger (those skinny fries are sooo good!). Our friend had one of their BJ's deep dish pizza and I had a slice. Not too greasy and with just the right about of crunch from the dough. Then we topped it off with the red velvet pazooki  which was amazing! But it's hard to go wrong with a pazooki. The guys tried out a couple beers which they all thought were decent  but non of us are any sort of beer experts. Overall the food was great and atmosphere was comfortable  but just a little loud. Not the kinda place you want to go for peace and quiet  but not overbearing either. Our server came to check up on us frequently and she was very polite. Will come again!
Crystal Z.,Tempe  AZ,283,72,8,9/19/2011,4.0,Since I am so anti dives and pubs  this place is a good middle ground for me and my guy friends. It's a great place for happy hour - I love the nice ambiance and cleanliness  they love the huge beer list.And since it's right at Chandler Mall  I love that we can grab a drink  and I can hit up the sales. Perfect!
Stephen H.,Somerville  MA,77,88,,8/14/2012,4.0,Was taken here by client.Chips and salsa were a decent standard appetizer.Hopstorm IPA was a pretty solid IPA  not overly hoppy.Had the grilled pork chops  very well cooked  decent portion size  sides (salad  green beans  mashed tatos) were relatively uninteresting but no real negatives.The individual pizzas looked really good  prices seemed very fair. Good choice for solid food + beer.
Courtney C.,Saint Clair Shores  MI,238,39,3,6/25/2013,4.0,I usually order from the small plate menu but decided to go with a shrimp pasta dish the last time I was there. Unfortunately it wasn't great  or good  only blah. Too little shrimp and way too much pasta. The flavor was bland  so bland that I had to constantly pepper each bite. I'm going to stick with what I enjoy best  the small plates.
Lindsay M.,San Francisco  CA,321,279,114,7/6/2011,3.0,We frequent BJ's on girl's nights. They have good food  a casual atmosphere and great beer. I would give it a higher rating if their prices were a little lower for the type of cuisine you get. Can't go wrong with the crispy artichoke hearts  the pizzas or a baked potato.
Josh K.,Scottsdale  AZ,273,106,4,1/4/2012,3.0,"BJs is hit and miss...I\'ve had good food there  and I\'ve had mediocre food there. I\'ve never had a ""great"" meal  but that\'s not really what you\'re paying for or should expect. Everything is pretty ordinary  salads and appetizers are alright  entrees are alright. Service and environment is good typically  and they have some really good beers and good specialty items. Their draft root beer is amazing  and I would end every meal with a BJs pazookie if doing so meant I wouldn\'t drop dead from heart failure at 35. I like their burgers pretty well  but they took their classic burger off the menu  which was a bummer. It was really good  so that\'s too bad. It\'s a good place to watch a game or to grab a bite if you\'re in Chandler  but it\'s never going to wow you. I\'m sure I\'ll be back soon enough  because it\'s a solid  reliable place to get a pretty good meal."
Bill V.,Phoenix  AZ,246,121,218,5/20/2013,3.0,I had to go for a work function. I feel obligated to write something since it's a restaurant and this is Yelp  and I ate food. As I get older  I get less tolerant of chain food. BJ's is so prototypical  that I couldn't stay for very long. The service was agitating at best... food was sub-par. I truly hope I dont have to go back anytime soon. I gave 3 stars because some people like chain food  and this was only below average  not horrible.
Violeta H.,Phoenix  AZ,212,363,138,12/22/2010,4.0,visited BJ's for the first time while attending a company holiday party. they had a great buffet style setup for the entire group-appetizers  pizza  and cold drinks. we were all in the patio and it was chilly but still comfortable. the restaurant is nice and open.we went back and the pizza was just as good as when it was not on our dime.. I like that. Chicago style pizza awesomeness! OMG.. one slice fills you up. the pizza is on the rich side so not the kind of pizza you eat often but a great place to treat yourself. looking forward to trying the beer and thin crust pizza...btw  they brew their own beer.
Kay G.,Goodyear  AZ,19,39,,12/9/2010,4.0,Good quality food & nice staff  our server SAM  rocks! She was attentive  kind  and full of knowledge about the food and refreshments. Try the Oktoberfest beer! Then make sure to have dessert--they can make the desserts in a smaller portion size. Mall parking  nice location and comfy and cozy atmosphere.
David D.,Chandler  AZ,52,178,123,10/23/2013,3.0,The atmosphere here is pretty nice for a weekend dinner. The massive TVs always have a good game on to watch. The food is pretty good but not amazing. The pasta was decent. The pizza is there area they shine.
Julie Y.,Chandler  AZ,9,25,1,8/18/2013,2.0,We had a mixed experience here today. I'll start with the positive: The appetizer platter we got was very good and the kids LOVED the mozzarella sticks. The adults enjoyed the avocado spring rolls  the other kind of spring rolls (not sure what they were called)  and the artichoke dip with chips. The beers we selected were also good. I loved mine  but once again I can't remember the name (it was the one our waitress said was the closest to a blue moon beer). Lastly their thin and crispy fries were wonderful! Ok  so now for the bad: The men in our group ordered some kind of chicken tacos and the other ordered a personal size pizza...both were TINY portions. I was not thrilled with the so called sourdough bread that my California chicken sandwich was on...the bread tasted a little burnt. The worst thing about this meal was that the waitress announced that they were out of the chocolate chip pazookie dessert for the rest of the evening....WHAT?! When you have little kids that look forward to this dessert  it is not a good thing when you are told that! This was a late Saturday afternoon...how do you not have plenty of those desserts on hand for a SATURDAY NIGHT???? I still enjoyed the white chocolate and macadamian nut mini pazooki that I got and the kids liked the cookies and cream one they tried. The pazookies at Oreganos are still better in my opinion....Anyway  not sure if we will be going here again  but maybe we'll try the deep dish pizza next time.
Pete C.,Mesa  AZ,1,4,,2/11/2015,1.0,Food and beer were good but the atmosphere sucked. I was there watching the NFC Championship game and we were cheering (not obnoxiously mind you) during the game and kept being asked to keep it down. Are you kidding me? Needless to say they were a bit full of themselves there. I won't be going back to that hoidy toidy place again. Went across the walkway to Buffalo Wild Wings and had a much better time there.
Jeff N.,Chandler  AZ,0,5,,3/18/2015,2.0,"I rarely write reviews but after this current scenario I just had to. I visit this location very often. I rarely have a bad experience. About 1 year ago  I was there and ordered an appetizer  salad and dinner. The appetizer was stuffed mushrooms that were served ice cold. We told the waiter (bartender) and they took care of removing it from the bill and brought a new ""hot"" one. When my salad was served  I had requested creamy garlic dressing (which they no longer offer) and instead  it came mixed with some type of vinaigrette along with creamy garlic. The manager now had to come over for the second time and agreed something was wrong and again replaced the item. My main course (pasta and chicken) was excellent. The manager removed all the defective items from our bill along with a discount and I was happy with that. Now about 6 weeks ago  I returned and ordered a new item that the waitress recommended. It was the deep dish lasagna. It was disgusting and below the first layers the food was ice cold. I called the waitress over and told her the issue. She sent the manager over and he agreed something was wrong. He left the table and the waitress brought the tab which had no adjustment for the lasagna that was inedible. I was so pissed that I paid the tab along with a 20% tip as she did a good job. I wrote to the company the following day about my dining experience and was immediately contacted by the store manager who apologized. He stated that he meant to take the lasagna off the bill but got busy talking to some people and forgot. He told me to provide my address which I did so he could mail me a gift card to try an entree on them next time.That was 6 weeks ago !!! I\'m guessing he may no longer be managing there anymore....."
Kevin C.,Hereford  AZ,85,275,70,7/14/2011,3.0,"Brak likes BJ\'s. For a ""brew house"" kind of joint  the food is WAY above average. Some of the servers have been here for years and are great. Others are horrendous - we\'ve had service ranging from outstanding to unacceptable here. But the food has been consistently good. Brak likes the chicken parm lunch special. The marinara sauce has an extra spicy kick that\'s both unusual and very tasty. Would have granted 4 stars if not for the spotty service. But the food has been consistently good  and is a regular spot on our office lunch rotation."
Ceci G.,Tempe  AZ,113,421,45,3/22/2011,3.0,I've tried to go to this place many times  but the days and times where always a mistake as it can get really crowded. Spoiled for so long with 4 peaks  I had to give it a try no matter what. They have a long list of their own beers and that was the best. I had the Grand Cru seasonal and it was just fine. Food is ok too  but they seem to fill your taste with the presentation of massive dishes. I had a BBQ sandwich that was ok but nothing I would order again. French fries are good  but sorry I'm far too adapted now to the ones at 4peaks. Friday night or Saturday are the best days to go and frustrate yourself looking a spot to sit. Sunday for lunch worked much better.
Laryssa S.,Scottsdale  AZ,41,20,3,9/19/2013,4.0,I was pleasantly suprised at how good my steak was! Love their beer too.. definitely a fan of their house hefe
Eric F.,Los Angeles  CA,158,13,,11/27/2013,3.0,Honestly this is the worst BJ's I've ever been to. Service was slow. Root Beer tap was broken. Spinach and artichoke dip was cold when we got it. Pizookie was not fresh. Just not the best. My sandwich was still great which is why this is a 3. Could have been worse.
Abhishek N.,Phoenix  AZ,12,36,2,10/12/2013,3.0,Options for vegetarians are few but good. We ate the California club flatbread pizza as appetizer which was nice and crispy. For entree we ordered the toscana with no meat  fish or eggs. Along with spinach filled mushroom. Will give a 1 out of 5 for spinach filled mushroom. 2/5 for toscana and 5/5 for pizza. Over all we are happy about the decision to try this restaurant.
Lynn W.,Chandler  AZ,355,399,,7/10/2010,4.0,I went to BJ's when I lived in California. The one in Cupertino is nice and big. I had some time to kill before I went to a movie and it was July 4th so some of the other places had closed early. BJ's was pretty empty. I bellied up to the bar and the bar tender was there instantly. She was great! She gave me a menu and gave me a minute to look over a wine list because  silly me  I thought I would have a glass of wine....what was I thinking? The bartender told me they had a great seasonal brew so I said I would give it a try. It was a heif...er.....hief....dang  I can't spell it...but you know what I mean and it was good!! It has a nice cardomon finish but not overpowering at all. I ordered a Santa Fe Salad and it was delish! Nicely cooked chicken breast and cruncy tortilla strips. The dressing was good but a little too much of it. Still I would order it again but maybe ask for dressing on the side. The service was stellar. The bartender  which I could remember her name  was knowledgeable and she was pleasant. We chatted a bit and she was the same with the other patrons at the bar too. When you eat on your own it's nice to go somewhere where the service is friendly and welcoming. They brew the beer here too. All in all it's a great place with a pretty varied menu and good beer.
Emmy M.,Silverthorne  CO,112,109,,7/8/2011,4.0,Oh BJ's... your manager saved you from getting a 2 star review. We came here to watch the Sharks during the NHL playoffs which was also during the NBA playoffs. Not even exaggerating  EVERY single TV had basketball on... so we asked our server if they could turn ONE TV to the sharks game. So they did and some douche bag at the bar gets upset because the TV in front of him was changed even when there were tons of seats at the bar right in front of the other TVs. Anyways  long story short guy complains  bartender agrees it was stupid to change it  and they change it back to basketball. We were pissed but thankfully  the manager did his rounds to make sure everything was okay and ended up changing another TV for us where we had a good view. Thank you!We come here very often during football and hockey season. Happy Hour is great  but make sure you sit in the bar area to get HH prices. The great white pizza is amazing  and so is the pizookie! I like it here because it's a great place to come with the family and have a beer!
Carmelo W.,Glendale  AZ,188,457,60,6/14/2013,4.0,I had a parmesan chicken sandwich there and it was really good. my bill was average too. service was nice and relatively quick. I'd definitely go again for lunch.
Jeff P.,Phoenix  AZ,11,164,,3/17/2013,3.0,"Bottom Line: Food is mediocre despite nice ambience and serviceFood lacks flavor. It\'s as simple as that. There is nothing about the food that makes you want to come back...even for bar food. All of the dishes lack flavor. They look pretty on the plate but the flavors are not there. The calamari is dry and flavorless. The wings come dry without sauce; you have to ask them to ""toss the wings in sauce"" to get what is normal wings(wet wings drizzling in sauce) anywhere else. If you don\'t ask that  they serve fried chicken with dipping sauces  sorry I can get that at KFC not at a supposed premium bar. The salads taste wilted and the dressings seem to lack flavor. The beer was mediocre. The menu is entirely too large.This place is a hit because of it\'s location and it\'s atmosphere. It\'s an upscale sports bar resembling the Yard House so a lot of people like to come here to have comfortable seating  nice service and nice tv\'s. But the food was very disappointing and if you care about what you eat  look elsewhere."
Michael C.,Scottsdale  AZ,3,10,,10/27/2012,4.0,We are a regular at this particular location. It is a great place to hang out. The portions are large and we frequently share a dish. The atmosphere is enjoyable. It is a sports bar that actually feels like a nice restaurant.Great value. We go there once a week.
Jerod M.,Maricopa  AZ,3,112,129,7/14/2011,5.0,Service is always great  and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you. This is one of my favorite breweries to come too. They have a good selection of beer that is made in house  and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer  which is also amazing) I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here.
Joe P.,Avondale  AZ,104,170,11,1/30/2013,4.0,The stout is my favorite here... great place for happy hour. Cheap beer and the mini pizzas are half off. The pizookie alone should get 5 stars. My only complaint? Too many choices. You would think that is a good thing... well its not. I get so overwhelmed with choices I end up getting the same thing every time. Food prices are a bit high. They could certainly tone down the portions a bit  nobody should ever finish an entire serving here... its always way too much food.
T B.,Anchorage  AK,21,295,24,5/21/2013,3.0,Decided it was time for a half-pound burger  had their bacon burger which was very good. Not a real fan of the ambience and might stop by here on occasion.
Yanira S.,Chandler  AZ,71,259,445,4/22/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I've just come back from my second visit to BJ's and I'm STUFFED! I love the food and drink here-you just can't go wrong with this menu. The deep dish crust on the pizza is still amazing and this time we tried their chocolate chunk pazookie-nom nom nom!!!!
Josh P.,Berkley  MI,45,139,,7/12/2010,1.0,"Man did this place suck. Sunday night  dead as dead can be. The only time we saw our waitress was to take our order and pick up my credit card. We had to flag someone down in the middle of our meal to get some waters (which we never got)Food was sub par. Avocado egg rolls were just deep fried guacamole. It felt like I ate 2 avocados as an appetizer. One minute after my first bite  we got our salads (now I\'m feeling rushed) My wedge salad should have been called ""Sliver Salad"" or ""Molehill Salad"" Not good. Wife and I shared a pizza which was decent but nothing like the picture in the menu looked like.Truthfully  I would have returned all my dishes but there was no one to talk to. I felt horrible for the table next to us. They had triplets who couldn\'t have been older than 3. They waited at least 15 minutes for the server to come up to them and another 15 minutes to get their drinks.My wife went to the bathroom and saw our waitress in there on the phone complaining to her friend about rent money. She\'d make that money if she focused on her tables. We left her 10%. I walked in planning on leaving her 50%.We\'ll never go back again. What a shitty corporate establishment.My amber ale was good."
Marty F.,Scottsdale  AZ,260,314,12,10/15/2010,3.0,"Ive been here a couple times. The service is not too bad  but if you have somewhere to go  let them know in advance you\'re in a hurry... they like to take their time.Ive ordered their sandwiches a few times and have been somewhat satisfied with them. Nothing incredible  but not horrible.  However I did order their nachos one time. They bring out this mound of red  green  plain nachos with tons of cheese  chili  peppers  etc all over it. I was thinking this is gonna be good. After eating the top half of the nachos (the best part)  I find myself tasting nothing but salt salt and more salt. in the end  im thinking ""Would you like some nachos with your salt?"" Ive been here at least three times  and probably wont be rushing back anytime soon."
Ari S.,Chandler  AZ,0,13,,8/22/2011,4.0,For a brewery type restaurant they do a pretty good job  in fact mabe the best one in town for me. Most of these type of places do a very mediocre jobs with a very extensive menu. BJ's has a great gluten free options. the pizza is very good  probably the best I've had in town. good selection of beers. service is always pretty good.
Julie S.,Tempe  AZ,3,26,,2/26/2012,1.0,I'm not quite sure exactly how I feel about this place. I took my family (6 ppl) there for my adult sons birthday. The atosphere was great  the decor was very nice  but the service and the food  not so much.First we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were. It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating  was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience. We were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well  there is always hope. First the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress  you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down.To make it short and sweet  the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked  the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet  there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it  I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato? You have got to be kidding me. I spent almost $200 and left disappointed  that should never happen.
Nizhoni S.,Phoenix  AZ,49,20,6,5/3/2013,1.0,What is that smell?!? Just walked in  had to leave to throw up... Didn't make it past the hostess stand :/
Matt S.,Queen Creek  AZ,183,425,1030,3/11/2010,4.0,Excellent. Can't say enough about the sampler plate & pulled pork sliders. YUM! Very fun place  lots of TVs and of course SPORTS always on! Love going here.
Michael L.,Chandler  AZ,8,18,,4/8/2011,5.0,What can I say  this place has it all. Great service  a hugh variety of food to choose from.I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza  but I could go on forever with all my favorites. Check out there craft beers too.Simply delicious.
K P.,Chandler  AZ,5,79,,2/25/2012,4.0,"I\'ve been going to BJ\'s for lunch since they opened. The food is 5/6 on a scale of 10  but what brings me back is the atmosphere. It\'s very comfortable and inviting whether a party of two or twelve. It\'s a ""must lunch"" for out of town guests due to the handcrafted beer selection. Always a hit and now a ""tradition."" First BJ\'s - then bowling. After a few Ales  Blondes  Stouts  and Reds  no one cares how many pins they knock down (hee  hee  hee)! If you haven\'t been  you should go! I prefer lunch. Dinner is crowded."
Gehan K.,Chandler  AZ,48,182,15,9/25/2012,4.0,So this is actually one of my best places to go for happy hour. Good drink selection and a nice ambiance. Second time around did not disappoint me. Calamari was great and do try to Mediterranean veggie pasta dish....very healthy.
Jennifer O.,Phoenix  AZ,358,1805,72,12/30/2011,3.0,This place was surprisingly better than I thought it would be. I went here for lunch with my grandma yesterday and it was alright. The one thing I really didn't like was that their menu had too many different types of food and the lunch specials  although plentiful  didn't look all that good to me. So we decided to share a few apps. We got the spring rolls  lettuce wraps  and the mozz and tomato salad. The salad was pretty good  the balsamic on it was tangy and it was a decent deal at 3$. The spring rolls were also just alright....they were like a tex mex spring roll....the plate has a lot of rolls  but the sauces they serve with it weren't very spicy or flavorful. The lettuce wraps were kind of the same way.... they were a bit bland  not bad  but not good. We ended the meal with the triple chocolate pizookie. This was the best part....super chocolatey and delicious. I'd go back if I were in the area  but for the price  it isn't anything special.
Erisa F.,Chandler  AZ,9,1,,9/26/2013,1.0,I dont think I will go back there for food anymore. This is my second time to get overcooked food with poor service waitress 
Ross A.,Gilbert  AZ,1,81,,5/11/2013,4.0,This place has one of the largest menus I've seen in a while. To top it all off the food is pretty frickin' good. The burgers are better than many other chain restaurants I've tried. The pizza is surprisingly great. And the appetizers are good enough to make it a main meal.
Jill T.,Chandler  AZ,23,65,1,2/11/2010,4.0,I've been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints.AND - I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service. BJ's is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good.
Lauren J.,Gilbert  AZ,155,314,10,11/25/2012,4.0,I've gone here a few times and have always liked the food and service. I like coming for their happy hour (and reverse happy hour). Their menu is huge (think Cheesecake Factory) but everything I have had is good. The ambience of the restaurant is nice  not a big place but it's cool to see the brewery through the glass next to the restaurant. I would recommend the pizza!! They also do a pizza cookie but I LOVE the fact they have a brownie...mmm! They also do a trio of cookies  which is amazing. The only con's would be price and their chips & salsa. Both can be improved :)
A J.,Tempe  AZ,0,13,,2/9/2014,4.0,We've only been here once but we really liked the booth setup. Shoestring fries were very delicious  the fish was ok  the Asian salad was also very good. Seems like typical college co-ed sports bar and the wait staff were very fast.
Michael L.,Chandler  AZ,104,8,,8/25/2013,5.0,Great pizza!  I ate here tonight and thoroughly loved their signature deep dish pizza - absolutely fantastic. BJ's has a great atmosphere too.
Jennifer R.,West Deptford  NJ,9,7,,7/2/2012,4.0,Went here the first night in Surprise  AZ with my sister  her boyfriend  and my husband. We were visiting them for a few days and they highly recommended this place. We got the pot stickers and mozzarella sticks and both were very delicious. My husband had the porkchop and said it was very good. I got the small bite meatballs and they were very good. My sister got the small bite mac and cheese and we all tried a bite of it and it was very good. Her boyfriend got a hamburger and said it was ok. This place was reasonably priced and it was worth going to.
Becky A.,Chandler  AZ,66,172,63,5/14/2012,3.0,This place is good. I have nothing bad to say...it's your standard brewery type place...although the menu is the like the size of Cheesecake Factory's. Depending on how busy it is  service can be really good  to fair. We don't go out of our way to go here  but if we're in the area  we'll drop in occasionally.
Jarratt W.,Monterey  CA,44,88,5,8/24/2012,3.0,Please turn up the AC!!! The food was ok  just not very excited about this place. Best thing about it is the Light switch beer.
Jason L.,Chandler  AZ,6,17,25,6/24/2012,4.0,We really love the food  atmosphere and beer! Watched the NBA finals the other night and it was perfect.
John C.,Scottsdale  AZ,10,247,228,2/6/2013,3.0,Big  chain restaurant with a huge TV in the bar. Happy hour prices are good and the bartender was nice while we waited for a table. We were there for a birthday party and the server did a good job handling a big party. The food was average for this type of restaurant and the prices were reasonable.
Jaswant A. S.,San Diego  CA,36,570,413,4/26/2012,3.0,"Ok. So one of the lunch companions in our""foodie club"" is actually THE Duke at this very establishment. Yup. THAT many check-ins.I\'m not really sure exactly what benefits a title like ""Duke Of BJ\'s"" would get you. Perhaps it might get you out of a speeding ticket or get you backstage at a classic rock dinosaur reunion show but you might end uphaving to ""prove"" your credentials. So anywaythis place is never my first choice but itgets voted in our rotation so I\'m a regular here. The lunch special tacos are light andmake for a decent lunch. The miso salmon isalso good although a bit pricey. And I mustsay the Chicken Parmigiana is also quite doable. Came here once for a happy hour andappetizers were meh. Also  you never knowwhat level of service you\'ll get. We\'ve gotsome very professional and courteous waitressesand we also have had our share of either totallyclueless or just plain rude waitresses. Wenever have seen the latter a second time so that\'s a good thing."
Julie H.,Gilbert  AZ,1,6,1,9/30/2014,2.0,"My coworkers and I order from this BJ\'s often  mainly because it\'s one of the few places around us that delivers. The food isn\'t terrible  but the service usually is. Just about EVERY time we order  one or more of the following is inevitable; there is food missing  we are over charged  the person taking the order doesn\'t have a clue what they have on their menu  it takes an unreasonable time to get delivered (usually because the driver gets lost) and the ""delivery charge"" amount is excessive. The past few times have just been ridiculous. In fact  the last time we ordered  we had every one of the aforementioned go wrong. We were charged separately for every single thing that should\'ve been included in our meals  (fries  salads  soups  etc.)  the delivery gal headed the opposite direction of our location and took over an hour and a half to get here. The food was nasty  cold  rubbery and some things were missing. I don\'t know how the dine-in service and food is around lunchtime  but I can assure you that they need to do some serious adjustments to their take out/delivery! Just because we are eating take out  doesn\'t make our order  service or food less important. GET IT TOGETHER  FOLKS!!"
Jeff K.,Chandler  AZ,76,103,89,3/26/2012,5.0,I've been to BJ's a lot through the years mainly for lunch and sometimes for dinner. Their beers are excellent. My favorite is the pirahna ale. Everything that I have ordered is always excellent brewery food. My favorite lunch is the California Club flatbread pizza but you can't go wrong with the soup and salad or the sliders. They have a huge menu too. C'mon it's a brewery so you just know that it awesome.
Jose T.,Chandler  AZ,48,197,281,8/29/2010,4.0,The wings here are excellent. I rate them at the top now that VooDoo Daddy's is no longer in business. Their other food items are good as well. Nothing too special  but very above average.The wait staff has always performed to my expectations.If you are a fan of rootbeer  this is the place for you. They brew their own  and it is magnificent. It's got a good bite to it.This place is able to accommodate different types of customers. They have an outdoor seating area  they have a large bar equipped with flat screen TV's and surrounding bar tables  bar stools  & booths  they have their general dining area wrapped around the middle of those two areas. I'd come here for the wings alone.
Shanna K.,Ypsilanti  MI,159,432,21,3/7/2010,4.0,I was actually really impressed  even though I didn't think I would be. I headed here for lunch last week when Chipotle was super busy.They have a great and fairly affordable lunch menu with lots of options  including lots of vegetarian options. I also really appreciated that my waitress went back and checked with a vegetarian staff member to see if the tomato soup had meat stock (it didn't  but minestrone did).I got the pasta with the soup or salad combo with this delicious Mediterranean pasta - olive oil  feta  pine nuts  tomatoes and red peppers. The pasta itself was surprisingly bland  but with a hint of salt and pepper  it was pretty tasty. The bread that it came with was also delicious  all on its own. I got the tomato soup  and man  it was definitely one of the better tomato soups I've been lucky enough to have.My server was great about the food coming out quickly  and was on top of my refills. Very friendly  not over-crowding.I'll be back in the future with my partner to get a better feel for the beer (which I don't drink) and meat dishes (which I don't eat)  but I'm happy with my first visit and will be back!
Brandon M.,Gilbert  AZ,0,12,,7/27/2014,2.0,Normally love this restaurant but last two times my wife and I have come to this location it has been sub par. The table that they placed us at was completely covered with the previous occupants remains. After we had to run down a waiter to have the table wiped down he did it very quickly which left us with the food gone but a sticky table. We just used our napkins to lay over the table so we didn't have to deal with the stickiness. After we finished it took us 15 plus minutes to flag down our waitress for our check (which she did not even ask to refill our waters once the entire time we were there) and the place was not even busy. Needless to say probably be the last time we attend this brewery  the extra 10 minutes it takes to drive to San Tan Brewery is worth it.
Tom D.,Charlotte  NC,22,13,,4/3/2012,5.0,The best steak salad I've ever had! Love the fresh brewed beers too! Excellent menu with choices for everyone including gluten free. Every time I go to Chandler for business  I have to stop in at BJ's at least twice!!
Deb S.,Tempe  AZ,67,774,25,7/3/2012,2.0,I think that BJ's is a hit-and-miss kind of place. Today was just meh. We three gals were out to lunch before a movie at the Chandler Mall location. The menu is huge  the TV's are on with sports action  the drinks were cold  service is adequate  and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout  the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side  which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture. Our server was unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer our questions. Maybe she was new? I know that it's tough to be a waiter/waitress and they sure do work hard. But hey  a smile and some friendly service goes a long way with me.
Daniel B.,Phoenix  AZ,402,147,36,11/8/2011,3.0,BJ's has a very large menu  too large I think. When you have large chain restaurants with huge menu's you already know that they are trying to cater to the masses rather than producing a really quality specialty item. For the most part I was pleased with my order. I went with the Creole Tilapia  which is on their under 575 calorie menu. I considered the Chicken A La Fresca but the waiter advised me that it wasn't that great. I was very appreciative of his insight and honesty. The beer they serve was pretty good as well. On tap they have everything from a light beer to a nutty oatmeal stout. If you aren't sure what you're in the mood for then BJ's is a good place to go as they have descent food and tons of it.
Adam D.,Chandler  AZ,0,8,,3/7/2013,2.0,Slow service and cold nachos. I did like the seasonal Red Beer but the food and service were disappointing. My family has been conning here for years and while the food was never amazing  it was consistent and what I expected. This time food and service was both poor. We waited for ever the check and finally had to grab someone after ten minutes of not seeing our server again. Next time I'll just have the beer.
Kerri B.,Mesa  AZ,0,23,3,1/22/2013,4.0,Good place to drop by for happy hour. Great selection of beer  and love their flatbread pizza.
Carmen M.,Mesa  AZ,3,13,,6/2/2009,3.0,I've been on a quest for a flavorful  texture-rich  full-bodied salad. The last one I really enjoyed was the Santa Fe Chicken Salad at the BJ's in Mesa. So  today I went to the Chandler restaurant for a work lunch in hopes of satisfying the craving. Work hours meant no beer...maybe that's why I didn't inhale this one as fast. It was still good. I'd order it again. I'd also order the Pizookie made with peanut butter cookie. That devilish little treat (that I shared  btw) got me on a new PB craving. Ugh.The salad was $10.95  and came with well-seasoned chicken (minor kick)  corn  avocado  tomatoes  red onions  tortilla strips and a good dressing.
Stacy C.,Aurora  CO,202,261,416,1/31/2010,4.0,I love BJ's. The menu is a little too big  but everything I have tried is great! The beers are good  if you like good beer  i.e. something other than Coors or Bud. The wings are awesome  they just drizzle a bit of sauce and then give you more on the side so they don't get soggy. The bruschetta is delicious. The thin crust pizzas look great  but I haven't had one yet. The avocado egg rolls are yummy and the grilled shrimp tacos are one of my favorite dishes. Perfect end to a day of shopping at Chandler Mall.
Francesca R.,Thornliebank  United Kingdom,109,563,64,10/28/2009,3.0,Everyone loves BJs. Well  men particularly.That's right--I went there.Thanks! I'll be here all week. So  the restaurant--solid three stars. Good pub grub  good beer  great happy hour  friendly service. Nothing out of this world but a reliable place for a night out.
Nicole C.,Chandler  AZ,36,58,22,3/5/2012,3.0,I'm kind of in the middle with BJs Brewery I like to go here for lunch every once in a while. Overall the atmosphere is what tends to bring me back its very inviting and relaxing. The food is good I really enjoy their Santa Fe spring rolls as an appetizer  the pizzas are always up to par and lets not forget their skookie they have for dessert yumm!!! I also love that they have pear cider on tap here where many other places I'm lucky if they serve it at all. Overall its worth stopping in and giving it a try.
Philip T.,Gilbert  AZ,14,139,79,1/28/2012,4.0,Way above average corporate food. Beer selection is excellent. Food is good and service is way above average. My only complaint with the place is the menu. Do I really need to read through a 20 page book to figure out what I want? If you're looking for someplace to kickback and relaxed with a good brew and good food; BJ's is hard to beat
Brendan W.,Strawberry  AZ,6,321,348,2/18/2012,5.0,5 star deep dish pizza. Great sandwiches  good service. Call ahead to see how long the wait is. They turn tables quick and staff up so wait time isn't bad.  Located in front near Chandler mall fountains. You can walk around with pager.
Max Y.,Guadalupe  AZ,1,7,,7/13/2010,5.0,This review is going to be a bit lopsided because I only come in on Tuesdays for their drink specials.The food I've had has been really good: flat bread pizzas  spring rolls  lettuce wraps  burgers  and best of all  their pizookie. All of it is great every time. Tuesdays are definitely the days to go; $2 BJ's pints from 10 to close. You'd think the selection of brews to have on special is too narrow  but they've got a beer for anyone. My favorites so far have been the Jeremiah Red (pretty strong Irish red ale)  the Nit Wit (Belgian spiced ale)  Big Fish (a pale ale stronger than the Piranha pale ale)  and the Grand Cru (10% Beligian!). The servers we've had over the past couple years have all been great and really friendly. Totally worth it  if only for the Tuesdays.
Christopher G.,Phoenix  AZ,1,72,,3/18/2014,4.0,A great place to hang out and have an awesome meal with friends. Great food and beer. fast  friendly service.
Jennifer G.,Pinal  AZ,73,208,,4/9/2011,4.0,First time visiting BJs last night and I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered: BBQ Ranch chicken salad with avocado added. The salad was fricken huge and I loved the crispy onions on top. It was cold and refreshing and divine! Hubby got the California burger and said it was ok. All in all  a decent place but was a bit pricey. 12.00 for my salad and 10.00 for his burger that wasn't very big. Strawberry lemonade was ok but Chili's has better. Pizookie was good but they are easy to make at home  not worth it to pay for one here. Service was good although my avocado was initially left off my salad. Would I go back? Yes I would but not often since its kinda pricey for what it is. Would get the salad again  maybe try their pizza  and some of their brews.
Katarina H.,Chandler  AZ,53,64,,6/22/2011,4.0,I eat here at least once a week. The food is great and I also love how they've expanded their menu as of late to include dishes. I am a huge fan of their blackened salmon.
Jason N.,Gilbert  AZ,188,150,192,8/30/2009,5.0,The root beer that they make is should be considered CRACK! I go there just for the root beer. Everything in this place is good they have a few floor managers whom walk around asking you if your food is ok. If its not they will take it back and then something else is back to you in 10 mins. And its right next to a comic book store to boot. Its a good area to go and eat. I would visit again and again.
Devon A.,Chandler  AZ,337,273,106,7/31/2009,4.0,BJ's is fun if you're with a buddy and need a quick bite before a movie over at Harkin's. The beer is made on the premises and is really good  they got a ton of huge tvs  sitting at the bar is a good idea if you're not there with kids  and the baked potatoes rock. Pizza is just so so  salads are good  and burgers are just average.
Danny D.,Lexington  KY,772,365,47,10/11/2011,5.0,Brook at the bar was nice. This place had great air conditioner. Nice selection of beers.
Deiniol M.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,252,73,44,9/22/2008,2.0,A note to the owners of BJ's Restaurant & Brewery regarding the style of pizza you serve:I don't know what it IS  but I can tell you what its NOT  and its most definitely NOT 'Chicago-Style'.How do I know this? Because up until about a month ago  I called Chicago home for the last 20 or so years.Pizza has three main ingredients- a crust  a sauce (typically a tomato-based sauce)  and cheese (typically mozzarella). Serving two out of the three does not mean you can still call it a pizza. This is pass/fail  all or nothing  an you are not graded on a curve; there is no 'E' for effort.Now some will argue  but typically  'Chicago-style' pizza has a thick crust and  in at least a couple of restaurants  the sauce and cheese layers are inverted  but the pizza HAS sauce (am I making my point here  or am I being too subtle?).Do yourself a favor  BJ. Go to Chicago  and go to Gino's East  Pizzeria Uno  Due's  and Lou Malnotti's for a crash course in what 'Chicago-Style' pizza is  then come back here and fix this trainwreck of bread and cheese before you do any permament damage to the phrase 'Chicago-Style Pizza'; well  no more than you've already done.Your one saving grace is the beer you brew right on premises  otherwise this two-star review would be a one-star review  and I'd never have a reason to darken your doorstep  or subject anyone else to your bread with melted cheese on top.Keep up the good work on the beer  but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over. Then I may try another one of your pies; until then  I'll just stick to the beer.Viewing it from that angle  then  BJ's has a nice bar. Its a bit loud inside for a restaurant  but for a bar  its just fine  and they do have lots of TVs tuned to just about anything you could want to watch.Come for the beer  stay for the... beer. But if I've been too subtle  and you missed the point- don't bother with their 'pizza'.
Katie F.,Chandler  AZ,136,14,2,11/15/2010,5.0,Probably my favorite spot in this city to get Gluten Free pizza! They also take into account cross-contamination for us Celiac's  which means I can go out to eat without stressing or worrying over whether I will have a migraine with the hour. Anybody out there with similar dietary constraints can appreciate the significance of that. Besides the pizza  though  they have a pretty wide variety of GF dishes  and my non-Celiac friends and family always seem to find a dish they love  (my mom always gets one of their pastas). I go here once every few weeks  typically. Love it!
Emily H.,Sandy  UT,99,127,13,11/28/2010,4.0,Had a wonderful meal with friends at BJ's. They loved the avocado rolls as much as we did (BEST avocado spring rolls ever!) and we all ordered the California chicken sandwich. It did not disappoint! Service was fabulous--those Diet Cokes with vanilla just kept coming. And the Pizookie was a hit as well.
Tracy M.,Chandler  AZ,1,9,4,5/19/2011,5.0,I love this place! The staff is super friendly and the food is always good. I especially enjoy the bar area with all of the TVs for enjoying the games. I don't know the Manager's name but he was super helpful when we wanted to celebrate a friend's birthday.
Emily T.,Saint Louis  MO,36,233,7,9/14/2008,3.0,BJ's is OK on occasion. My husband loves the mostly sauceless  tomato-strewn pan pizza. Me  not so much. However  the atmosphere seems fun (kind of loud  but that drowns out our usual loud talking). There are flatscreen TVs throughout the restaurant  in case a game or a major weather event (hurricane season) is on. The booth seating is comfy  and we see a lot of families  so it looks pretty kid-friendly as well.I've tried various dishes here  such as sliders washed down with BJ's Hefeweizen. The sliders and thin fries were pretty darned yummy  and the 5 oz. taster-sized Hefeweizen was the perfect size (and price!) for a lightweight and/or someone who has to drive soon thereafter... I am not a beer connoisseur  so YMMV! On separate occasions  I've tried the Angel Hair Toscana dish  which was just OK and came with a side of garlic bread. I've had the French dip on a couple occasions  and that is highly recommended; I love a good au jus... The other night I tried the Field of Greens salad with candied pecans  feta  red peppers  and a balsamic vinaigrette; that was quite yummy. I coupled that with a taster-sized Berry Burst Cider  which is really sweet and hit the spot.For dessert  the Cookies N' Cream Pizookie is quite good  so you might want to save room for that (be sure to share it with 1 or 2 more people ~ it's rich and should feed at least 2)! The Apple version pales in comparison ~ don't bother with that... Finally  I'm a caffeine fiend  so I was pleasantly surprised that their coffee does not taste like old socks.I recommend BJ's for a casual night out.
James D.,Gilbert  AZ,0,24,,1/29/2012,5.0,If you want a big and tasty burger get the black and blu burger its so goood! Very juicy
Kelly C.,Mesa  AZ,52,152,26,8/24/2011,2.0,The food was probably a 3 star  but the service and the price were definitely a one star deal. I think if the server had deigned to crack a smile (Adam I think) his face would have broke. And it was so overpriced it wasn't funny. $9 for a mediocre margarita  are you kidding me?   We ended up spending like $50 for lunch  what a bunch of bs. Would never go back unless unless someone else was paying.
Jessica F.,Saint Paul  MN,3,86,,10/3/2013,3.0,Came here with some friends after work. Our waitress was pretty good  friendly. I really only care about food. I ordered the wings. They tasted fine - not great by any means. Not nearly as good as BWWs  which is pretty much next door  or Applebees. I think what I didn't like about them was that they were a little more expensive than getting wings elsewhere ($9.50 for 10 wings) but they were TINY! One of my friends had a pizza  which looked delicious. If I went back I'd probably try something else. If you're craving wings  head elsewhere.
Kevin G.,Tempe  AZ,109,253,43,5/20/2011,4.0,Another restaurant Kevin and I frequent when we are out and about in Chandler. Good prices  and the food is consistently good. I love the vegetarian pizza. In fact  their pizzas are all pretty good. Kevin got the nachos last time  which he enjoyed. I am no beer critic  since I pretty much hate it  but since it is a brewery  I can only assume the beer is up to par. The service is also good  and I love how lively it always is  even at ten on a Monday night. I always walk away satisfied and with the confidence that I have not just wasted my money on mediocre food and drinks. Thanks for being a friend  BJ's!
Tk G.,Chandler  AZ,10,79,9,7/4/2009,4.0,"Went here  after we got a housewarming gift card from our realtor. Foor was surprisingly delish! We ordered  again  bruschetta and a deep dish pizza. Had the beer sampler  since I\'m not big on hops  this wasn\'t my thing  but they do make their own root beer  which is just as yummy! For desert we had oreo deep dish cookie  served w/ 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream (YUM).Only thing is  the waitress seem to ""forget"" something you asked for...1st time we went  they ""forgot"" my drink  2nd time  I asked for ranch dressing and she ""forgot""  I had to ask another waiter...Go online to find a $5 coupon...its well worth it!"
Cassandra R.,Chandler  AZ,52,61,2,6/25/2008,4.0,The mini burgers here will be the death of me.
Matt F.,Phoenix  AZ,1,10,,10/14/2009,4.0,This place has some great food. I haven't yet found anything on the menu that I don't like instantly. The pizza  the sandwiches  the appetizers  the desserts... all good. Despite this  my favorite item on the menu is definitely the Berry Burst Cider. I haven't yet found any other decent cider in the valley.Atmosphere: goodService: goodMy only beef: I did once have the jambalaya and that simply left me wanting authentic Cajun.
Jeff K.,San Francisco  CA,25,108,7,5/9/2011,4.0,The Pizza rocks. I like the crust.
Jasmine C.,Phoenix  AZ,171,850,,5/1/2008,3.0,Just not all that. If I am eating at the Chandler Mall then there are 4 restaurants I would rather eat at.
Brian T.,Phoenix  AZ,72,173,8,10/16/2008,4.0,Chandler Chamber of Commerce Event hosted by BJ's ...Food was really good! There were probably over 100 of us at the event and the service was surprisingly good as well.
Lauren C.,Tempe  AZ,144,2,,8/13/2011,5.0,Enjoyed a night out with an old friend! Had some beer and potato skins and they were fantastic. I love the atmosphere  its warm-themed and and dimmed. Service was great :)
Carina M.,Seattle  WA,272,973,157,5/12/2008,2.0,"I am no stranger to BJs - I grew up in California  which is where this chain originated from.I\'m not a fan of this BJs. We live about 10 minutes away from it  but I find we go to the one on Superstition Springs more often. We go to BJ\'s for the food  never the drinks.Hubby\'s a huge beer lover. When we lived in San Francisco  we used to do pub crawls with our friends in search of the perfect pint of Guinness.Anyway  we went to this BJs because he had heard good things about the beer here  more specificially  their brewmaster. He\'d read rave reviews and thought  ""why not? we\'re practically around the corner!""Off we trotted and he ordered the beer and I ordered a salad...and he was angry. Angry at beer. What?! Not again. It\'s ok. I was angry at my salad and the slower service.He finally learned his lesson - never get the beer at BJs. The first BJs experience was back in California at the BJs in Cupertino  across the street from the Apple campus (yes  as in iPod). He and his best drinking mate  Matt  went for beer...one they ordered tasted like Juniper. The second one he ordered ""tasted like how sweaty gym socks smelled"". His exact words. *gags a little*He thought it would be different at this BJs...but was sadly mistakenBJs on the whole will never have imported beer. If you want a decent selection of imported beer  I suggest going to Whole Foods -- you can pick up Belhaven!My salad pissed me off. There was more dressing than salad. I wanted some lettuce with my dressing. Our server kept sneaking off - don\'t want to know what he was doing outside for long periods of time and come back smelling of smoke.My suggestion? Seriously? Skip this BJs and go eat at one of the other restaurants. This one won\'t do it for beer...or food."
Jonathan S.,Laveen  AZ,0,110,2,7/24/2011,4.0,All you California peeps out there stop in for a little taste of home. Great casual dining and microbrews.
joe i.,Phoenix  AZ,31,92,,7/17/2007,4.0,BJ's has some great beer  and the food is not bad either. I know it's a chain  but it does exceedingly well for a chain. Probably one of the best out there. The Jerimiah Red beer is excellent  as well as the Piranah something or other.If you go  try their thin crust appetizer pizza. But try it as a meal. It should be more than enough. If not  you can then fill up on beer.
Pam M.,Gilbert  AZ,44,11,,10/23/2011,4.0,I went to BJs for the first time for a dinner with some old co-workers. I read the reviews before I went so I had an idea of some of the areas where I might have problems. I am happy to say that my experience was a good one. It was a Sunday evening so that might have helped since it was not very crowded. The weather was nice so our group of 5 sat on the patio. The service we received was very good. He was attentive and funny. Also was helpful deciding what to order from the enormous menu. I had their Pumpkin Ale. It was decent. I liked it better than Blue Moon's Pumpkin Ale since I could actually taste hints of spices. I will definitely try other varieties of their own brews when I return. Two of the other girls in my group went for the root beer. I tasted it and it was good but I'm not enough of an expert to say it was any different than A&W in a can. The other two had mixed drinks and found them to be a bit pricey - $9 for a frozen mixed drink? The table started with chips and salsa. Nothing special there at all. I would pass on that in the future. I ended up having the steak salad and it was very good. I liked the touch of the roasted potatoes.  All in all a good visit but the food is on the high side so I can't see myself going there often. If they had a reverse happy hour like Gordon Biersch I could see myself going more  but due to the price I will save trips here for special treats or during their happy hour in the day.
Jessica L.,Phoenix  AZ,0,2,,4/18/2013,4.0,I've eaten at BJ's a few times before but when I went there for lunch a few days ago I was surprised at how much I enjoyed on of their lunch specials. I ordered their parmesan crusted chicken sandwich and LOVED it. This is not something that I would typically order and I was so pleasantly surprised. Although the food was awesome  our server was less than average. She seemed as though she would rather be anywhere besides waiting on our table and I really didn't appreciate it. She didn't bring out any of our food and never checked up on us until we were done with our meal. The restaurant was not busy at all so that wasn't an excuse. Besides her poor attitude  I would totally recommend this place  especially that sandwich.
Beth F.,Tempe  AZ,113,23,1,7/18/2010,4.0,I went to BJ's for a group birthday celebration and overall had a good time. The grilled chicken potato was good as usual  as was the berry cider. Our service was a bit slow but the waitress was friendly and trying her best.
Tony N.,Gilbert  AZ,28,29,,11/17/2010,4.0,I eat here today. The service was good but not that I complain but we ask for four water and the waitress bring only three. Guess she is distracted. The food is good. I like it when my salad come with thousand island. Yes score! The nachos is okay with sauce but not with eating alone. I like mine salty. Otherwise  I don't have much complained.
Ryanne F.,Tempe  AZ,16,16,1,9/5/2010,4.0,Very good food. Good service  even when busy. Their own microbrews. What's not to like?
Michael M.,Farmingdale  NY,14,53,,10/1/2007,5.0,This was my first BJ's experience and I fell in love. I have since been to many others and I love their beer. But back to this one  the location is super sweet! Its a big reason I love this Brewery being next to the mall made it perfect. Let me explain...Ok so it was Christmas time and I went out to visit my sister and I still need to get some presents. So my sisters boyfriend took me to this mall and he said we need to stop here first. I was like well ok I guess  and man oh man am I glad we did. It made shopping so amazing (I hate to go shopping during this time period as should anyone) it quickly became my favorite way to shop... slightly drunk! :)So as amazing as the shopping experience was I was very glad to have had a chance to discover one of my favorite beers Tatonka Stout.
derrick k.,Chandler  AZ,1,35,,8/2/2010,1.0,I know it's a chain restaurant. I know it's in a mall. I know i shouldn't expect more but  I do. I have gone to BJ's many times in California and had consistently good results. Last friday I took a friend and my nephew to eat here and were very disappointed. The service was bad  the food mediocre at best and the prices were no value. I can understand if it was busy and the wait staff was swamped. But when people are standing around and you still have to flag them down for everything from water to the check  inexcusable. Also I am not opposed to paying for food that worth it but  this BJ's I could not justify anything.
Greg L.,Gilbert  AZ,51,35,3,3/19/2010,4.0,This was my first time here  a fellow yelper recommended it. We went during lunch time and I must say it was delicious. I just followed my friends lead and we went with the huge sampler platter which was all full of goodies. I don't remember the names of everything but the guacamole filled mini burrito things were so freakin good. I then had the mini pulled pork sliders and loved em in fact my mouth is watering as I think about them right now. Anyway great place for a lunch meeting.
Lilly W.,Chandler  AZ,0,13,,6/10/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,We had guests visiting from California  so we decided to take them out to BJ's for dessert for their famous pizookie! What a horrible idea. Each one of us had it  and each one of us got sick. I mean sick like vomiting and diarrhea! Will never go back there again.
Keriann E.,Los Angeles  CA,8,51,5,1/2/2012,5.0,The food and beer here is the same as at any other BJ's location--consistently solid. The customer service at this location is excellent  however. My friend spilled her beer while trying to maneuver into the booth  and the manager not only replaced the beer  but found her a BJ's t-shirt in the back to wear home. Totally above and beyond the call of duty.
Art R.,Tempe  AZ,4,330,1,12/28/2011,4.0,While I am not usually a fan of corporate restaurants and brewpubs  BJ's in Chandler is an exception to the rule. The beer is fresh as it is brewed on site and they usually have a couple of offerings that set them apart from the main street amber ale brewpub crowd. The best deal is the all you can eat soup and salad at lunch for around $8.00. Food is above average pub food and the pizzas are a ok. They also make root beer for the kids.
Logie Z.,Tempe  AZ,377,439,145,10/2/2010,3.0,I'm not a beer drinker...but my husband is! So this review is for their food. I know that this is a chain and it's the kind of food that you'd expect from a chain. At least they are consistent with the quality. They do have the best Cobb Salad that I've ever had. It must have been the combination of the greens  bleu cheese  turkey  avocado  tomatoes and bacon. Last night  my son wanted Pizza (A Friday night staple for the kid)  so we ordered the Margherita Thin Crust Pizza. I like an almost cracker crust  but this was way too thin and too crackery. He ate two small slices. I know he wants the more flaky bread kind of dough. They do have a deep dish  but we're not into that either.  I ordered a Wedge Salad. My brother-in-law asked what the hell it was and why I have half the iceberg on my plate. I don't like iceberge lettuce  but this is almost embarrasing to admit that I do like this salad!  I know it doesn't have any nutritional value. Heck  it has negative nutritional value. My BIL and DH both had the Sourdough Burgers and they both truly enjoyed it. It's this kinds of Pub food that you come in to this place for....and the beer  I guess.
Stephanie H.,Surprise  AZ,23,26,18,2/15/2011,4.0,My husband and I were looking for somewhere to eat around Chandler fashion center that gave a mall employee discount  and really no place does. But when we asked at BJ's the manager said he'd give us 10% just because we asked. Can't promise they'll do that everytime  but it was pretty cool and we decided to eat there. We got the fried artichokes and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers  which were very good. Then we split the calzone for two and promised ourselves we'd pace ourselves and take some home. But it was too good and we ended up finishing it.Our server was pleasant and attentive. I have gone back roughly once a month and sit in the bar area killing time until my husband gets off work. The staff never minds and I usually have fun chatting with them on their slower nights. I prefer this location to the one at Park West in Peoria. The staff is much more friendly and apparently the location in Peoria does not have the same deals on Tuesdays.
erica k.,Phoenix  AZ,64,2,,2/12/2008,4.0,I like the beer  love their mixed drinks  and the food and location are great as well. Try their roast beef dip w/ fries!
Molly S.,Mesa  AZ,6,44,,12/24/2010,3.0,good beer selection...tried them all! food menu is a wide as can be...a couple great salads I always get like the italian chopped (which the just changed...bummer) and the french fries are awesome. the soup and salad endless combo at lunch is a winner
Holly T.,Philadelphia  PA,354,698,1217,7/9/2006,4.0,I've been to about 5 different BJs and this is by far my favorite. The food is the same as at most other BJs  although this one has honey breadsticks that I haven't seen anywhere else. What distinguishes this BJs is the brewer. In addition to the usual BJs brews  this brewer concocts new original brews all the time  found only here  and brewed on premises. One time I had a BJs Belgian style Grand Cru here that rocked my world. The only problem is that it's super crowded and there is usually a wait. Plus it's at the Chandler mall  so it's...mall-ish.
Joe M.,Chandler  AZ,0,11,,12/12/2008,2.0,The brew is ok I have had better  and the pizza is ok  nothing crazy good and the atmosphere is alright  I'd rather go somewhere else any day.
dave s.,Chandler  AZ,82,44,9,4/20/2007,5.0,One of my favorite places to go for a nice meal and a beer. I usually order their Chicken Salad and Jeremiah Red beer. After a couple beers  the restaurant is within stumbling distance of the Chandler 24 Movie theater.
Stacy L.,Palo Alto  CA,29,171,,1/5/2007,4.0,Good selection of beers  really nice assortment of menu items  and big group friendly. I had a few too many beers to recall much other than a happy feeling about the place  especially since my jambalaya dish was tasty. And they had avocado egg rolls that I really liked  that was while I was still on my first beer.
Amanda T.,Tempe  AZ,0,5,,12/8/2011,4.0,I give this place 3.5 stars. The decor and space was amazing..very spacious and very nice design. The staff was friendly- but our server was a little flighty- I don't think she had been working there very long as she wasn't very familiar with the menu and had to ask us what the menu said. I am a restaurant manager and I would never put someone on the floor who wasn't familiar with the menu- it looks bad on the serve and on management. We ordered 2 ribeye dinners and 1 chili cheeseburger. My brother requested his steak to be rare and when it came to our table it was more on the well side and when he asked to have it sent back and cooked the way he wanted the man- who I am assuming was the manager- acted like it was a hassle. My steak was slightly overdone but still edible and tasty. My husbands chili cheeseburger was amazing! The chili was very tasty and it was a huge meal! He left very satisfied! One thing I absolutely loved was the horseradish mashed potatoes- they were amazing! I had never had horseradish m.potatoes but I am glad I tried them- I even started making some at home. The mixed drinks were amazing too! My brother ordered a glass of their dark beer and he loved it- he has always loved dark beers and this beer was right up his alley. Oh! Almost forgot- we also ordered the mini bruschetta for our appetizer- and WOW! I could have eaten 5 plates of that stuff - the best bruschetta I have ever had! Overall this place was really good! The food tasted amazing- I am glad because they are kind of pricey but no complaints on the price because it was worth it :)
