Madison P.,"Bowling Green, KY",11,231,152,4.0,12/17/2017,"We had lunch here while I was waiting for my IPhone to be fixed.  So there are no pictures. My first time at this location.  The wait time was 15 minutes but it was only about 10 minutes. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea.  I could smell the liquor.  It just didn't have a strong liquor taste.   I had the Cuban Sandwich.  It comes with Fries. I ate nearly half.  The sandwich is large and very tasty.  The Bread was delicious.  In fact I'd like all my sandwiches made with it.  My Husband had his favorite Rib Eye Steak, mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Of course my fork found his vegetables. Good time.  More Long Island Iced Teas for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville
William S.,"Yucaipa, CA",27,197,6,4.0,11/16/2017,"I like the Cheesecake Factory. I like the 400 page menu. I like the desserts. I like the Asian fusion type food there a lot. I like the appetizers. I like the ambiance. There's a lot to like about the place. In this specific instance, however, I have to take away a star for the service. I was traveling for business. Without getting into specifics, the nature of my trip meant I was all by myself for a few days which, by itself, isn't the greatest. So it's fairly annoying when waiters treat me like I'm some kind of a weirdo for having the temerity to dine alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville
Tanya P.,"Jeffersonville, IN",65,108,299,3.0,10/16/2017,"Standard Cheesecake factory offerings.  We traveled to Nashville for a friend's Bday and this was where she wanted to go.  There were 6 in our party and even though we'd called ahead for seating we still waited an additional 30 mins to be seated.  Once seated our waitress Rene did take good care of us, refilling drinks regularly and stopping by to talk with us.   I ordered from the small plates menu. The beet and goat cheese salad was amazing and really a good portion.  I also got the crab cake bites which I found to be disappointing.  I thought they'd be little crab cakes but they were balls that were mostly breading,  kinda like a hushpuppy with a little crabmeat.  I wouldn't recommend them.  I finished off with the lemon meringue cheesecake which was true to its name. Excellent choice,  I did share a couple of bites but I totally finished it off. My friends got Pizza, a cuban sandwich, some kind of pasta, and some thai dish...the Bday girl ordered Orange Chicken...however all of the other 5 of us were done eating before her dish even arrived at the table!!! And our waitress had come by a couple of times to say they were making or remaking her plate.  They gave her a free piece of cheesecake but I thought at that point the meal should be comp'd This particular chain is not a favorite of mine,  I find them to be overpriced for what they are. Plus I don't care for thier ""dine in the dark"" lighting setup...but not my bday,  not my choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville
Beth E.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",70,30,173,4.0,8/22/2017,"Vegan Review!  The Avocado Toast appetizer was so good!  My husband got the Veggie Burger without mayo and cheese and with sourdough bread instead of a bun. He like it, it had a really different texture to it. I got ""Evelyn's Favorite Pasta"" with the pasta tossed in olive oil instead of butter, and without Parmesan. The dish was very flavorful, and I especially liked the rigatoni noodles. No vegan cheesecake, of course, but still a bummer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville
Michelle R.,"Nashville, TN",1,93,43,3.0,9/24/2017,If I could give 3.5 stars I would. This Cheesecake Factory is pretty solid. Obviously there's nothing unique about the menu but there's definitely something for everyone!  We were seated relatively quickly and our server was great. We had the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer. Pretty standard issue fare.  I liked that we asked for just the brown bread and they happily obliged!  I love the strawberry lemonade and this one was made perfectly! For dinner I had the crusted chicken Romano which is my old standby. One order is enough for two meals!  My mom wanted a shrimp pasta dish but didn't want the cream sauce it came with but they happily swapped it out for a tomato sauce which was also nice.  Too full for cheesecake afterward!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville
Lydia D.,"Euless, TX",22,60,25,2.0,11/3/2017,"My inaugural visit to a Cheesecake Factory. After spending the day with my family at the Adventure Science Museum, we selected this a celebratory destination for dinner. It was evening and it was crowded, about a 30 minute wait. The restaurant a bit loud, a bit too dark and maybe because they were busy, we were served by multiple people which created confusion while ordering. Our drinks came out looking and tasting delicious and while expensive ($12), I was satisfied with the quality. We ordered the Crispy Crab Bites and the Ahi TarTare for appetizers which were exceptionally small and disappointing, literally 4 tortilla chips. Dinner included Fish Tacos, Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and my choice, the Factory Combination Steak Diana and Shrimp Scampi. The garlic butter sauce was delicious but the shrimp breaded and fried.. why!? Not what the description said. My steak medallions were cooked to my requested medium but sitting in copious amounts of oil, the flavor was there but I moved them over the the shrimp side of the dry potato mountain. The presentation of meals was lackluster and messy with the pasta bowl reminiscent of ratatouille. For the price that I paid I am not happy. Many improvements can be made in the quality and value of the food, attention to the order and maybe an increase in staff to better handle peak times. Shout out to the bartender for the drinks, the sour cream cheesecake topping and the one server who brought out the kids food in a timely manner. I can think of several other restaurants of better quality and lower prices, it did not live up to the hype.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville

Ron B.,"Memphis, TN",131,190,311,3.0,9/5/2016,"This was my first Nashville visit to this Cheesecake Factory location. Like other Yelp reviewers, I have visited several other Cheesecake Factories in other cities. The wait was not bad(15-25 minutes). We had a very good and attentive server who kept our classes full and answered questions regarding the daily specials.  The negative for me was the food did  not come to our table hot, but Luke warm, like it was under a heating lamp. I order the Steak Diane and Chicken Madera combination. The cheesecake was very rich and flavorful which I am sure is their number#1 seller(over 30 flavors).  I got a chance to walk off my calories at the Green Hills Mall, but that is another review in if itself! Final grade:3 stars for the great service/location. The food needs to come out hotter and faster the next time.

Robert E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",215,153,,4.0,8/8/2017,"Just left Cheesecake Factory. Was by myself looking for a great meal at a favorite place. First of all I had to wait 10 min. for a host to come to the front desk. I told him a party of one and he said step aside someone will be with you shortly. I was the only person in line. 2-3 minutes later a lady came and called my name and headed toward the bar area. I told her that I preferred not to sit in the bar area it was nosey (which is understandable) and the tables offer no privacy. When I told her that she seemed disgusted by my request and immediately said-""we have no tables available in regular seating, it will be awhile."" I stood there for a second stunned because I was looking at 6-8 tables that were empty. I simply said thanks but I will go elsewhere. She just wadded up my ticket and walked away. Haha- didn't realize I was such a bother! Have had great service before- but this time Cheesecake Factory was a loser! I want to update a previous review. My wife and I gave Cheesecake Factory another try today and our results were much different than before. We were warmly welcomed and seated within two minutes of arriving. Our wait staff was quick and helpful. Of course the menu is vast with plenty of choices. My wife measures every restaurant by the quality of their ""fish and chips""- today she gave the Cheesecake Factory a ""A"" on their ""fish and chips."" I had the lunch size salmon and it was excellent. We had the side dish of Cole slaw and it was yummy. The restaurant is very clean and modern in decor. We had an enjoyable lunch today at the Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville

Ron T.,"Smyrna, TN",45,176,24,4.0,6/16/2017,"""First visit. Oh Madeira!"" This was my first visit to Cheesecake Factory. All the females in my family had been a few times. Me and the son-in-law - first time. Why did we not go with them the other times? This is OBVIOUSLY  a chick place - obviously... We had eaten lunch a little early. We went to Cheekwood Mansion and walked the grounds for a couple of hours. My wife had a gift card for here and it was her birthday. This and the fact that we were a little (me, a lot) hungry - perfect storm. Oh! - and the mere mention of cheesecake to a woman - any other suggestions you make fall on deaf ears. You're talking and all they hear is blah, blah, blah...""How about Indian food?"" blah, blah, blah. ""How about sushi?"" blah, blah, blah. ""Steak might be good."" blah, blah, blah. ""Cheesecake Factory?"" ""Oh - The Cheesecake Factory will be fine dear - if you are sure that's what you want. I'm OK with anywhere!"" The women said the entrees here were huge. So I'm thinking - huge as in lady portion huge or huge as in manly man huge? I took their word for it and each couple ordered an entrée to share - Chicken Madeira . I did make it understood that if they were wrong we were stopping at the Burger King down the road after we left - and I wouldn't share. I was expecting a single chicken breast with the toppings described and a smidgen of pasta - we subbed angel hair pasta for the mashed potatoes. WOW! There were two chicken breast and more than enough pasta for two. There was a server holding each end of the plates while bringing our selection to the table and they were struggling at that - I may have exaggerated a little. The Madeira sauce blended so well with the angel hair pasta (or was it Madea - Oh Lordt).  I thought my wife loved me, but there was no to go box for her leftovers as she offered what she could not eat to our son-in-law. I'm going to probably need advice on a divorce lawyer...  After a short nap, we ordered four different cheesecake variations - can't remember what they were, but all were top notch. Not one of us could eat it all and we all received to-go boxes - HA! Mr. Son-in-Law! This is mine!!! In my opinion - the portions are way too large for one person. In our case we shared entrees and still took food home - well I didn't as previously mentioned - (let it go Ron, let it go). They DO NOT offer half portions which would be ideal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville

For just a piece of cheesecake, it took 20 minutes and I was the only one in line! The cashier was some rude kid that didn't want to take the time to put his cell phone down, stop chatting with the waitresses and just take a piece of cheesecake out of the fridge and put it in a box for me. None of the 3 waitresses took the time to stop chatting either as they did not care that anyone was waiting.

I had the Asian lettuce wrap tacos, only 420 calories. Very tasty with two sauces to dip it in, and just enough to leave room for cheesecake.  My partner had stuffed chicken tortillas, a big plate, also very tasty. It came with a corn cake, very good, and black beans.

John T.,"Franklin, TN",88,162,304,1.0,8/12/2017,"First of all this was not the waitress's fault. I have never walked out of a restaurant after having ordered food, until today. Waitresses get a bad rap because management refuses to hire or schedule enough wait staff to service their clientele. My experience starting out poorly in the fact that I was seated and handed a menu and had to wait almost 10 minutes for the waitress to show up to take a drink order. I might have expected this if they have been super busy but four of the tables in my section were empty. When she arrived she took my drink order and our dinner order and left. I actually think she might have left altogether, because 15 minutes later I hadn't seen her even walk past our area of the restaurant. My dinner partner actually got up and filled our water glasses himself, even though two other waitresses walked by with water pictures and filled all of the tables around us. Finally after waiting for what seemed like an eternity and still not seeing my waitress, I flag down a manager and asking to cancel my order because I was leaving. I would like to say I will return to this establishment but after this experience I find that highly unlikely. Most servers in large chains like this have to share tips and that is suppose to encourage the staff to help cover each other's tables, because an happy customer is a tipping customer.  If they share tips here then management has failed to instill in it's employees a since of team work that will help this restaurant thrive. The sad thing about this whole event is that this restaurant has excellent food for a big chain. However, if many more customers have an experience like mine it won't matter how good the food is because people just won't come to taste it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=20

My fiancé and I have been here a few times and we just went over the weekend for late anniversary/ celebration and it was so good! We ordered the egg role sampler which the salmon and avocado ones were our favorite. Then he ordered their best garlic pasta dish and he ordered me the tuna tatiki salad which was super yummy. Both of our dishes were incredibly tasty. My greens were great and the tuna was good too dipped in the sauce they give you. Exactly what I was craving! And his pasta dish O M G. SO GOOD!! It had peas, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and bow tie pasta but the sauce was where it was at! Then we ordered our cheesecake of course and he ordered my usual raspberry white chocolate and then I ordered the salted Carmel and my goodness it was delicious! It was a little heavy but in a great decadent way. I wish I had some right now! And our waiter was super nice and funny and spoke proper English which is just something I always look for in people even though it's weird lol we asked him how he was doing and said doing well which most people say doing good which is technically improper English and totally makes my skin crawl so he was 5 star in my book for that alone and he performed excellent customer service!

I don't need to write an elaborate review since 8 out of 10 people have probably been at one of these around the country.  Only thing about this one is that at the time of my experience the service took very very very very long, and the food wasn't prepared well (too quickly to compensate for service and how busy the place must have been) so it hurt mine and my boyfriends stomachs :( I hate to say that about this place but it's true.

It had been a while since I was there and a early dinner on a Sunday afternoon seemed called for. My date and I drove around the Green Hills Mall lot for what seemed like forever till we decided to park in Dillard's garage. It was almost empty and is only a short walk across the bridge. The Factory was busy but we were soon seated and waited on quickly. I was going to order one of their pasta dishes, but I noticed that the lady next to me had an interesting looking salmon dish. It turned out to be a Thai salmon on rice with snow peas. I am glad I saw it as it was delicious. I could have eaten it all, but opted to bring home half to enjoy the next day. Unfortunately, a house guest ate it before I could so I should have just devoured the whole thing while I had the chance! My date had a salad - avocado and turkey, I think, but I never remember what my guest has unless they complain - and she didn't.

Samantha B.,"Collierville, TN",217,763,2516,5.0,12/24/2014,"Holy moly do we have one of these in Memphis? Because this place was AMAAAAZING!  I met up with my friend and her parents here. Her parents were eating with friends so she got a nearby booth for the three of us. I had never been here before but I had just eaten lunch with my mom and grandma so I wasn't that hungry. I ordered an entree and hubby ordered hot chocolate and a dessert and we split them both. I really loved the bread they brought to the table- wheat and white loaves. I definitely preferred the wheat, as did my friend. My waitress was named Becky and she was amazing.  I asked for the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta with angel hair pasta instead of penne. They brought out penne and let me eat it while they corrected the mistake. I have to admit, penne was easier to eat. The meal itself is kind of soupy or wet so the angel hair pasta made it a messy meal. I will stick with penne next time! Becky let me keep both (yay!).  Onto the entree itself. The flavor of the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was amazing. However, most of the pieces of chicken in it were gristle and I didn't eat them. But the rest of it was great and it made great leftovers. Hubby and I were totally going to share the leftovers but ended up devouring it ourselves the next day instead.  The Dulce de Leche Hot Chocolate was so excellent my hubby only let me have a few sips before drinking it all himself. I wasn't as impressed with the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake but it was good as well.  When we came a second time I was excited to see a Thai-themed dinner dish, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp so I got it (with brown rice!).

Gabrielle F.,"Pleasant View, TN",0,1,,2.0,12/5/2017,"I tried the Cheesecake factory out for the first time last sunday. the food was absolutely amazing! i got the hibachi steak and it was beyond my expectations. but, when our food came, i didn't receive my tempura asparagus. i informed the waitress that i didn't get the rest of the food that came with my meal and she proceeded to argue with me saying that ""no, it doesn't come with it."" but she said i could have it added. i said okay, and she brought me a side of the tempura asparagus. a few minutes later, the gentleman that brought out my food brought out a side of the asparagus and in confusion asked if i had already gotten some and i said yes. i jokingly said to my mother-in-law ""i wonder if that was the one that came with my meal"" and sure enough it was. she brought out the menu after we were done with our food so we could look at the cheesecake options. to make sure i wasn't wrong, i double checked to see if it came with it. later we got the bill and i had been charged $7 for a side that i was already supposed to receive. when she came to take the bill, i told her once again that it came with it and she told me no, it did not and took off with the bill. we asked for a menu from another server so we could show her that i shouldn't have been charged. when she came to give us our bill after our dessert, we told her once more that the food came with asparagus and we shouldn't have been charged for it. she argued again and walked away with our check to check us out. we asked the people next to us to see their menu and when she brought us the bill back, we pointed it out and she said ""oh let me go talk to my manager."" well, after that, she took someone's order and then she took the table next to us with a party of 6 a ticket for the party of two on the other side. if they weren't honest about that, she would've been screwed. she came right up to us and said ""oh well the manager said since you've already paid there is nothing we can do about it."" so we asked to speak to the manager and she told us no because they were busy. SO NOT ONLY DID SHE LIE TO US ONCE, BUT TWICE!!!! SHE WAS ONLY SAVING HER BUTT. i will come back to eat again because of the phenomenal food, but never again will i be lied to and pay for food that came with my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=20

Jeremiah M.,"Mayfield, KY",1,7,,1.0,8/28/2017,"I give it 1 star for the food. I like the dishes here based on portion to price and taste. This chain seriously needs a hostess training overhaul.  No matter the location, the cheesecake factory hostesses are straight up unprofessional and rude.  It's like having to go through hell just to be seated and get the great food that I love to eat. One exception, Houston TX at the galleria, that hostess rocks, but any other locations I've visted: Seattle, Chicago, Nashville,  the hostesses act like they're possessed by the devil. FACT! At this location we waited 1 hr and 20 mins. I was told it would be 40mins by the rude hostess. As we waited we watched guests enter and be seated before us. I asked could we sit in the bar first come first serve, the hostess looked over at the bar area and said "" only the bar stools or high tops, not the booths or tables and good luck finding one"" though hellish rude, she was right as there were 3 high tops vacant but were cover with dishes and were dirty. They stayed that way much of the time we waited. After 1hr 20 mins my friend went up and asked why others were being seated before us, the hostess rolled her eyes and whispered to another hostess something and we were told to wait at the hostess station. At this time our buzzer went off and we were seated another 5 mins from then. Our server greeted us and informed us that this was ""like my 5th shift, so bare with me"" . He was slow and unprofessional in serving us, he seemed to be frustrated the entire time. He didn't know the ingredients in the dishes nor did he check to find out. I informed him of my allergy to onions, he just strugged his shoulders. I went on Facebook to the cheesecake factory page and posted a comment.  I noticed that the chain didn't comment on any of the complaints just the compliments. So cheesecake factory could care less if I eat there again, so I wont. The Macaroni Grill in opry mills mall is where I'll go.  I love being treated like a human being and Macaroni Grill has done just that all 4 times I've visited no matter the location.  It's a shame that not all restaurants like their guests because each one has different cuisine to experience.  But it's not very smart to spend $60 to be treated poorly when there's a Macaroni Grill that will love for me to visit their restaurant and to serve me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=40

I told him that my waiter found the bag and I had return just five minutes after realizing it was gone, what could have happened? He reminded me they were not responsible for any bags left behind... 40 mins later he calls me and says that apperantly the hostess had given my bag to someone else.

Surprisingly, it wasn't busy at all and from what I could see they had pretty good coverage waiter wise and a numerous number of tables though. When we walked in to be seated we were asked to wait 15 minutes so they can clean off tables. ....Ok, I guess but I noticed plenty of clean open tables in a wide variety of areas that looked to be covered by a waiter. First deduction.  When we were finally seated, our waiter came about 20 minutes after and greeted us and asked for our drinks. I didn't bother to remember his name because I was already pretty irked - but luckily I was pretty hungry so we didn't leave.  (Note: I've been to multiple cheesecake factories, and they've all exceeded expectations - food and service wise.) After what seemed like forever, our waiter took our orders and I picked the Crusted Chicken Romano. When we got our food, my pasta was hard. Like a bit before al dente. Still a bit flexible to the touch but a bit stiff nonetheless. The chicken was flavorless aside from the bits of cheese I could taste but it honestly just tasted like plain panko break crumbs. Overall, awful choice and I'm not going to be picking that meal at future locations.  In it's entirety, I could understand the poor service if it was a busy night. But, it wasn't. It looked just about dead by the time we left. Love the cheesecake factory, but I highly dislike this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=40

I understand that it is a chain restaurant so I should not expect organic salad but for anything so healthy and simple to taste so bitter was beyond my understanding. Nothing, and I mean nothing was probably washed before bring it out, looking nice is a bowl.  And for some reason they also served cold hard bread? In my understanding, the bread usually comes out warm, at least in our Charlotte, Nc and all Ohio locations. We nicely asked out server, who gladly replaced it but again with a hard cold one.  Never-mind the bread, but the salad was a deal breaker. How can something so simple that requires no cooking can taste so horrible and full of chemicals?  The lady manager came and made no apologies. I don't care if the respond on yelp and try to act nice.  Please stay away from CF. everything is frozen and re-heated and this place is OVERRATED.

He was bugging out on me, he was so hungry. I was literally watching him fall apart before me, and seemingly revert to a toddler once again (you know, he's 'above' reading anything his mom might write, so I don't have to worry that he'll see this, hehe).     So, the main goal was to get some food in him as quickly as possible. It was at least 5 minutes before anyone said a word to us...so I had no idea if we even had a waiter! Oh, and the hostess sat us at a table that had the floor covered with YUCK all underneath it. My son was trying to shove it out of the way with his foot - there was so much of it. It looked like a few really messy kids had sat there. I pointed it out...first mentioning it to the hostess seating us and when that was ignored, literally pointing it out to her. She did nothing. We had to sit in that filth the entire meal.  really?        I made it clear to our waiter how starving my son was, so at least he tried to get some bread out within 15 minutes, and tried to move our order along (I think). It was a loooong wait between bread and meal though. At one point he told us it was ready and being ""plated"" right then, so it would be right out. Nope...another 5-10 minutes. This is for a burger, grilled cheese and fries. Once it did come out, the fries weren't with it. He said they were cooking, but he didn't want to make us wait longer for something to eat. They did come pretty quickly after that, and were hot and fresh. My grilled cheese was good. The burger he barely touched. He said it was dry. When asked about splops on his plate that I thought was juice or grease from his burger, he assured me it was not.

In comfort food, I loved their chicken biscuit and mashed potatoes. Smothered in gravy, it was a delicious cheat meal.

Christina G.,"Tampa, FL",1332,992,1499,2.0,9/23/2013,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory.  However this one had a long wait and horrible service. First of all, when we first got there they said it would take 15 to 20 minutes for a table.  That sounded reasonable, but it definitely took longer than that!  At least 30 minutes!  Please don't lie about the wait time, because we were in a rush to make an appointment and that would have factored heavily into our decision. Once we sat down we knew what we wanted right away.  We ordered three appetizers, the Tuna Tartare, the Avocado Egg Rolls, and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, because we wanted to try different things.  I was really surprised that we were never given bread!  That might have made the wait time a little more bearable, because we ended up waiting over half an hour for our food!   Our waitress kept avoiding us, because she must have known we were not happy.  We didn't even get an apology.  And it wasn't even just our table!  I noticed the table behind us didn't even get their food until we were done and they had gotten there first. As for the actual food, the Tuna Tartare and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps were delicious, but the Avocado Egg Roll needs something more than avocados.  I felt like it was death by avocados. We requested our bill when we first got the food, because we really needed to go and it still took forever to get it!  Do yourself a favor and only eat here if you have hours to spare and do not care about the wait.  Otherwise, I would not suggest this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=80

We ordered from the Skinnylicious Menu and I got the Grilled Steak Medallions (Certified Angus Beef® Served with Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Sauteed Cherry Tomatoes, Crushed Croutons, Mashed Potatoes and Madeira Wine Sauce). My husband got a tossed green salad (with divine Bleu Cheese dressing!) and the Skinnylicious® Chicken Enchiladas (Covered with Our Red Chile Sauce and Melted Cheese. Served with Escabeche Vegetable Salad). He really liked the salad (it was HUGE) and his enchiladas.  He let the Escabeche veggies go--just didn't appeal to him.  I ADORED my steak medallions.  They were cooked to perfection, and were an excellent match to the asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes. The meat sat in a bed of heavenly mashed potatoes and it was all smothered in the Madeira Wine sauce...all for under 600 calories and it tasted like a million!!!  I only ate half (the portions were that big!) and was able to enjoy the meal for another sitting! We both ordered cheesecake to go.  I have an affinity for their Peppermint Bark Cheesecake (White chocolate cheesecake swirled with chunks of chocolate peppermint bark, topped with white chocolate mousse and finished with chopped peppermint) but it's only available during the holiday season.  When I found out that there was some in the case, I was ecstatic!  When I found out that was the LAST of the Peppermint Bark Cheesecakes that they had, I grabbed up two slices (and I think finished off that last cake!)!! I ate it later and it did not fail to delight!  AWESOMENESS!!!  My hubby got some kind of chocolate on top of chocolate on top of chocolate selection and was a happy camper.

Don't be afraid to walk!   The food here is always good.  Extra large portions and more than enough options to choose from.  Food is always fresh and comes out in a pretty timely fashion considering this location is pretty much ways busy.   Customer service is subpar sometimes, but you can tell the skill in their servers varies pretty widely.   If you get a server who can handle the business volume, the experience is usually perfection.  Sometimes you will get servers who are overstaffed or unused to such a busy place, but they make up for it with their kindness. Sometimes you'll be greeted by some ladies with attitude up front, but that happens infrequently. Drinks are crazy expensive here, so I definitely suggest doing your drinking elsewhere.  The Buffalo Blasts and crab dip are totally to die for.  As well as the caramel cheesecake and the Reeses cheesecake.  We usually only dine on appetizers and cheesecake.  The portions are so large here you'd hardly need to order an entree. 4/5 because it can get loud and the service is spotty.  Great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=60

Unfortunately I was in a hurry and did not have time to wait, but they brought out extra tomatoes to help reduce the salty flavor.  The reason I rated The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars is because I absolutely hate how often they change their menu. They ALWAYS get rid of their best plates. The fettuccine Alfredo with Sundried tomatoes is the best dish I have ever had in my life. As a regular to the restaurant, I was devastated when they removed the plate from the menu.

Nahyun K.,"Clarksville, TN",94,55,168,3.0,8/13/2014,"I give it 3 stars for 3 specific reasons. 1. This restaurant would get 4 stars if it was not for the last time I went. The steak was asked to be cooked medium but it was cooked well done. (The steak Diane was recommended by our waitress who was actually amazing and reminded me of Piper for O is the new B) The chicken was too dry and the mashed potatoes didn't taste fresh. Also, the Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta I always order was dry and lacked sauce.  2. I understand it is a chain restaurant and it's busy during dinner time but do I have to wait 20 minutes for the waitress to come go my table after the hostess sat us? We went through 3 different waitresses until we finally were able to order our food!  3. We paid $13 for 3 small spring rolls as an appetizer. The portions are ridiculously small for the price. Their dinner entrees are a generous amount but again, my food came out unappetizing. If you choose an appetizer, their fried calamari is bomb!  However, their cheesecake is to die for. It is hands down the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth! If you go here to try it out, I recommend going during lunch time or before the dinner rush. Don't be alarmed with the bad reviews but do take caution and the worst that could happen is you getting a over cooked steak or dry pasta!

Lee J.,"Lompoc, CA",12,49,38,4.0,3/22/2014,"How on earth does the Cheesecake Factory get rated so low? I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory and I admit I'm biased. I can only imagine that Nashville locals aren't appreciative of the super delicious dishes that CK Factory is legendary for.  I'm speculating here; Southern pallets prefer a down home cooked styled meal. Either that or the locals aren't fan of the 20 plus minutes of waiting required before seating. Maybe it's the crowd that CKF draws. I mean people pack the booths and tables often. It can get quite a busy. Call ahead if you can to avoid the major buzz kill when you arrive. If you're in a party you may want someone to scout ahead, get there early and reserve a a table or two.  If this is your first time to the CKF you may suffer sticker shock. Word to the wise, prepare for a bill of at least $60 for a couple not including drinks. If you're comfortable with that price tag then you're in for a great meal.  Newbies should be wisely advised to save room for dessert. Hard to do cause CKF always off generous portions. The entrée are spectacular but the deserts are what makes you a believer.

The restaurant itself is beautiful.  The food entree I ordered was not good at all. I ordered the cheese pasta (not sure the technical name for it from the menu). The taste was really bad. More like just all marinara and no cheese, except for the blob of ricotta in the middle. I am not one to complain in restaurants, so I ate what few bites I could put down and that was it.   The pro: the cheesecake I ordered was out of this world!! Dulce (some type of caramel). I have been dreaming about it since I ate it! Its delicious!   Regarding staff dress code: they look dirty! At least their clothes and shoes. And I'm not talking about hygiene. Look at those workers shoes! What should be white is nasty and dirty! Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is, because I know that is where most of their traffic is too. How about this...wouldn't it be better (I know it would look better) for the hostesses (who don't get dirty) to wear white? And the servers to wear black? I think the managers or whoever makes the dress code should consider a serious revision. Next time you visit take a look at their shoes. That alone will make one not want to eat anything that comes out of that kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=100
Cynthia B.,"Nashville, TN",0,2,1,2.0,3/1/2015,"Good food,horrible dining experience Disappointed  I've been to this location several times and was always satisfied with every aspect of the dining experience , that is up until recently. My husband and I decided to dine here one evening and we brought along our kids 6 and 12. The wait was normal on your typical weekend so that was not an issue. Where my issue lies is wear and how we were seated. We were seated all the way in the back close to the kitchen, as well as other African American's who were dining, along side Caucasian families who you could tell was not from that demographic area or (zip code) if you catch my drift. All of the servers for us in the ""back"" we're African American as well. While taking my youngest to rest room she noticed the front of the restaurant was seated with nothing but Caucasian people. It was bad enough when my husband and I caught on to what was going on, but what made it even worse was when both of my children noticed what was going on as well. I hated that there experience was less than acceptable,and I was very disappointed that they had to experience being discriminated in that way. I hope anyone in management reads this and seriously makes some changes.

When you enter you feel like your in Aladdins Palace, if its dinner time ask for a table that doesn't face the large window above the bar, as you will be blinded by the light, also there are a row of tables that face mirrors, this makes dinner awkward as the people behind you will think you are starring at them the whole time.  The drink specials at happy hour were priced well, were strong enough, but still had enough favor. I got a Long Island ice tea and a Bloody Mary, both I would get again.  As for the food it's delightful but pricy, the Cajan Pasta was good but was more tomato based, then Alfredo for my liking. The server forgot to bring us bread, but we were so full, it wasn't needed.

When you walk in you will immediately be amazed by the size of the restaurant, regardless of how gaudy the decor appears, all of which is quite analogous to the menu itself.  The menu is massive. I've never been to a restaurant with such a large menu. If you want it, chances are they have it - everything from tacos to filet mignon. The problem with this is that it's not easy to scan the menu.  I've been to this location a number of times since they opened. I've had an equally bad number of experiences as I've had good experiences. This is primarily due to the service, which is spotty at best.  If you are planning to visits this location, be sure to set aside a good 2-3 hours. Chances are you'll probably wait an hour. By the time you're seated, order drinks and peruse the menu, order appetizers, entrees, and finally finish your cheesecake another two hours has passed.  The cheesecake is quite good.

Kristen C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",120,18,33,1.0,1/7/2014,"After waiting 1.5 hours, (as expected on a Saturday evening), the two of us were sat at a small table in the corner of the bar uncomfortably close to another couple. Our waiter, (whose name was never even divulged), approached our table in a hastily manner and greeted us with, ""What's going on here""? Puzzled by his abrupt greeting we replied in confusion that we'd like to start with the Warm Crab & Artichoke dip. I understand Saturday nights are hectic and the restaurant is extremely busy, however I did not find it appropriate to hasten our dining experience due to their inability to cater to multiple parties simultaneously. As our appetizer arrived and before we even took one bite, our server came out to tell us that it was a, ""23 minute ticket"", and that our entrees were already prepared. He asked us if we wanted it anymore to which we declined & requested our entrees. He proceeded to take our appetizer away, then returned with it saying it was on the house. One bite in, and I see something shiny hanging off my partner's cracker. It was dimly lit so I assumed it was a cheese strand, later to discover it was a blonde hair. Neither myself, nor my partner has blonde hair. As we showed our waiter, his response was, ""Good thing it was on the house"". I was appalled at his response to say the least. Our entrees arrived, and were delicious as expected. Approximately mid-way through our final course I noticed what I thought was a small fly on the wall directly next to my face. I asked my partner what it was, he replied, ""it's just as fly"". As I blew air at it in an attempt to make it disperse, it only crawled closer and closer towards me. I ripped a piece of napkin from the bread basket and squished the bug from the wall and threw it on a used appetizer plate on our table for closer examination. To our horror, it was a baby cockroach. At this point my meal and complete dining experience at Cheesecake Factory was utterly ruined. Our server got one of the managers, Jose, and he offered us free cheesecake (which I was not sure I even wanted), and to comp our entire meal, (water, an uneaten appetizer, two half eaten entrees, and a slice of cheesecake to go). He also ensured us that the restaurant gets, ""bombed"" every month and that the next scheduled was the upcoming week.  I understand completely that a fine establishment such as Cheesecake Factory would have such a long wait time on the busiest day of the week. With this understanding however, I am unsure as to why the staff is not properly trained, or adequate enough to accommodate these conditions. I also comprehend that poor timing, accidents, and uninvited creatures can happen. What is baffling to me is how ALL of these mishaps occurred in ONE night, to ONE dining party. I cannot imagine what that says about the restaurant as a whole. I was more disappointed than angry about the entire experience as I waited 1.5 hours for my anticipated delicious meal to be dissolved into a horrible nightmare and an empty stomach.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=120

Red velevet is my personal favorite.   Cons: The wait here is atrotious.  The place is too dang big and I felt agoraphobic the whole time I was there. You cant hear yourself think. The menu is colossal and the advertisements are repugnant. Given their food portions are huge, their prices are just as high. It averages about 3,000 calories a meal. No wifi. Yea, seriously. The first thing I thought of when I walked in the place was ""I would hate for a tornado to roll through here"".

Alishah N.,"Franklin, TN",22,107,9,3.0,3/11/2013,"I like the Cheesecake Factory for it's plethora of options. The joke being their menu is so huge they have to take out ads to support the printing costs. And, impressively, for a place that has American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese and more, they do it all quite well. Portions are huge, bread is really good, and desserts are worth skipping the main course. That being said, the wait at Cheesecake Factory's gotten to the point that we avoid it. Weekends, you can face a 90+ minute wait - and that was even for a table for 2. Brunch, Lunch and Dinner, the waits are getting to be a little crazy - the best times are off-peak times or weekdays. The last time we tried, we waited for an hour and 45 minutes and were told it may be another 10-15 minutes... I ended up handing off my pager to another couple who had just arrived, and my wife and I went elsewhere. So while the food is good, it lately has not been good enough to warrant the wait. Update: Wanting to give them another shot, I tried again on a Tuesday at 6:30. We were told it would be a half hour. An hour and 15 minutes later, we were told we were at the top of the list and just needed a table to free up. The manager said he would do a quick walk-around to see if any tables were clearing up, and finally after waiting about an hour and 20 minutes, we had our table. While the manager was apologetic, and even offered a complimentary appetizer, it's incredible to have waited almost 3 times the estimate we were given.

Teresa H.,"Cary, NC",0,1,,1.0,9/10/2016,"Had a bad experience that the management staff simply made worse. Arrived last night and requested a patio table. Noticed that the table was wet which we pointed out to the hostess who simply said they had just sanitized them. After sitting down we noticed the smell of bleach and wondered about it. After ordering our drinks from the waitress, the other person in my party noticed a spot on her shirt. When she stood up to let me look at it, we discovered it was where bleach was bleaching out the color of the shirt. She turned around and we saw more spots on both her shirt and pants and then saw that my shirt was bleached as well. We immediately told the waitress who brought over the shift manager. She apologized profusely and admitted she had cleaned the area with bleach to try and get rid of a major fly problem they had been having. We moved to a table inside where we were told they would take care of our meal and they just wanted us to relax and enjoy our meal and not worry about anything and she would check on how they would take care of our clothes problem. We ordered 2 appetizers, drinks and cheesecake as we had originally planned. We were told we would have to buy replacement garments and bring back receipts to be sent to corporate who would reimburse us. When we were ready to leave, I was brought a bill with a single appetizer comped after being told the entire would be covered. Returned today with receipts for replacement clothing and spoke to the general manager who was flippant and acted like HE was being inconvenienced by having to deal with this! Also made him aware that we were told the meal would be covered and then were handed the bill with the single appetizer comped and wanted to know if he would make it right and give us credit as we had been told. Again he acted annoyed and begrudgingly said he would see what he could do. We will be contacting corporate ourselves to see if they will make this right. It is offensive to be treated like we are being a problem when we are the ones that had our clothes ruined by their mistake and our day was disrupted with having to go search for replacements today instead of doing what we planned because I am visiting from out of town just for the weekend. Good customer service means you put the customer first and make things right when you mess up. And you most certainly do not make the customer feel like you are the one being inconvenienced and that they (the customer) are being unreasonable.

The only reason for the missing the 5th star is the seating. My wife and I went here for date night and the seating was awful. We where so close to other people on both sides I felt I should introduce myself. There was zero privacy in our conversation.

The bread is actually really good and the desserts are delicious (after all, it IS called the CHEESECAKE factory) but I rarely get them because it's about 8-9 dollars for a slice of cheesecake which seems almost unjustifiable except just for the experience.

James L.,"Somerville, AL",39,57,58,3.0,12/22/2014,"Visited the Cheesecake Factory in the Green Hills Mall in Nashville, TN. Sunday night wait time was around 30 min so it wasn't too terrible. And we busied ourselves by wandering through the shops close by. Seated, ordered 4 waters, and got our bread without any hesitation or anything of note. We ordered our food (4 cheese pasta with chicken, Skinnylicious chicken pasta, and I can't remember what the other two in our group got.) and it came out pretty promptly. The servings are large, but the chicken in my pasta might've amounted up to a half of a chicken breast if I'm honest. My girlfriend wasn't overly happy about about her pasta either because it looked more like a bowl full of diced tomatoes with a smattering of pasta noodles. To me it was not worth the $17 for mine, or for hers. But, they were alright. Then we went onto dessert. I'm a sucker for a classic cheesecake. No strawberries, no cherries, no sauce. Plain ol' cheesecake. My girlfriend on the other hand, is not the cheesecake connoisseur that I consider myself. She got the Oreo cheesecake, and when it was all over, it looked like someone had murdered a pack of oreos and whipped cream on her plate. We were happier with dessert than the meal, but even with that, I don't feel it was quite worth the $50 plus tip that the bill came out to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=140

All of them.  Now for the food menu- the food is pretty good. We've eaten many, many items from TCF and most everything is good but I take issue with the sides.  For example, the fried shrimp is delicious but it comes with fries and cole slaw. I'd love to have the option to have fresh vegetables instead.  The catfish platter does come with fresh vegs but most items don't. If you order a steak it comes with fries. Several items on the menu come with- you guessed it- FRIES.  Now for the cheesecake. If you want the best cheesecake you may have ever had, this is where to get it. OMG. The slices are huge so I always take it home. I like to be very hungry when I eat my cheesecake, but  I rarely eat it all in one sitting. It's rich and creamy and a huge serving.  I've ordered whole cheesecakes for holidays.

Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,4.0,5/20/2012,"I like this place, it's certainly the best option at the Mall at Green Hills. I'm from out of town so when I visit this mall, the food court options have no appeal to me (I can have Chick-fil-A at home, thanks) so I try to pick places I can't have back home. Thus, when I'm there I go for Cheesecake Factory. To be technical, I'd probably give them a 3.5/5 - they're not awful, but they don't live up to the hype nearly as much as they should, given whenever you go there's always a wait. I mean hey, good for them to not be hurting for business, but it sucks when you're on a time crunch and don't have time to wait 20 minutes to be seated, especially when it usually ends up being 30-35 minutes in a tiny, cramped space where there's never enough seats and always too many antsy kids. But hey, the waiting area is never that big in restaurants. But the noise level of the restaurant is ridiculous. The acoustics suck (and do in all locations, I've been to others) and it causes everyone to echo, giving it a noisy, cafeteria-like atmosphere. Hardly the upscale-but-still-kinda-casual vibe they're going for. Other than that though, it's not bad. They have some of the best lemonade I've ever had. Most restaurants offer crappy Minute Maid, so it's nice to get it at places like this where it's freshly squeezed, and the sugar rimmed glasses are a nice touch. The menu is just ridiculous, in both a good and bad way. Especially on your first visit it's just plain overwhelming, and there's some stuff that's just not that good. Though some of what I've had is great: - The American Kobe burger sucks. Save the money and get a regular burger. The meat doesn't taste any different and isn't any more tender than a burger you'd get at Chili's. + Chicken and biscuits are good. Their biscuits are a shortcake batter so they're interesting, and their gravy's good, though I'm sure it's pre-made. - The fish and chips suck. They're frozen, for starters. And for someone who's had authentic fish and chips overseas, wrapped in newspaper...it's a huge disappointment. + The crab cake is good. I don't get it, but someone I go with usually does who's from the Maryland area originally so it must be okay. I've only had their cheesecake once since the portions are so huge. I can never make room for it. But the serving of cheesecake is small, far smaller than the cheesecake I've had anywhere else. It was good though, I just can't remember if I tried the key lime or the vanilla bean cheesecake. Maybe I've had both, but regardless their cheesecake is good.

Pros include the wait staff dress like they're ship stewards. If you look up, you'll notice how tall and useless looking the ceiling is. The drinks taste fine, although they're incredibly expensive.

I love their menu and I love how big the place is. I know better than to come in during lunchtime. But, work closed at noon, and I had to give this place a try since I was in the area. The place was predictably packed. People who got their pagers were all milling around in the wait area or in the chairs in the foyer.  I was told my wait time was 20 minutes. In actuality, it was more half an hour.  But I've waited up to 2 hours before at the Sacramento location during 3PM, way after a lunch rush. I've been craving Mexican, so I had their green chile burger. It was okay. The fries were crispy. And the Snickers cheesecake was awesome. They use a lot of whipped cream to top the cheesecake -- there was more volume of whipped cream than cheesecake. Service was very attentive. I like how they offer you bread and butter while you wait for your meal.  A weird thing happened to me when I was here. I dropped my knife and the women at the table next to me didn't even offer to pick it up for me to refuse them to do so. No acknowledgment even though the knife made a loud noise. I've never experienced aloof, unhelpful strangers before. This must be the snotty rich I have only read about. Perhaps they expected the wait staff to pick it up for me.

Emily T.,"Philadelphia, PA",376,34,,3.0,7/20/2011,"Having grown up in Nashville, Cheesecake Factory is synonymous with excess in my head. Excessively large portions, excessively large prices, excessively lavish decor, excessively large stomachs needed. The food is nothing mind-blowing: just your standard American fare generally done well for a lot of money. Every time I eat here, I bring enough food back for a second and maybe even third meal.  You've probably seen the crowds milling about the mall exit and wondered why they were all waiting for lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food. I, too have that question, but hey, it's damn good lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food, and over time has become a bit of an experience unto itself. If you're here, you're probably either celebrating something or rather wealthy. Be prepared to wait, although I've never waited for more than half an hour.  Anything that comes with their mashed potatoes is a safe bet, as they're everything mashed should be--large, creamy, delicious, will land heavily in your stomach and fill you up. The fried mac and cheese appetizer is delicious. Fish tacos are my favorite order, I've had good experiences with their chicken chipotle pasta, and any one of their sandwiches is a safe choice--good and economical, as they're on the cheaper end of the massive, massive menu, and they come with a lot of fries.

Funky decor.  Eclectic food.  A menu thick enough it would have made Tolstoy proud.  And cheesecake.  Oh, the cheesecake.  Like a culinary colors of Benetton ad, this place was the freaking UN of cheesecake. And 10 years later, that's exactly what it still is.  The Cheesecake factory hasn't changed; but the world around it has.  The food's still decent.  The cheesecake selection still unfathomable.  And the menu still has it's own zip code. But it's stuck in a bit of a time warp.  Like the lady you see at Walmart that's darn proud she can still wear her Jordache jeans, the old CF is pretty determined to keep the status quo. And why not?  It's still almost a two hour wait during busy times.  It's still kinda fun to enjoy the whole dated experience.  And those avocado eggrolls and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake still make me happy for each individual tastebud. And I still have a crush on Paula Abdul.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=200

Bob D.,"Valencia, CA",6,18,,2.0,3/3/2012,"I usually avoid The Green Hills Mall like the plague, but I was hungry and had no food at my house.  More importantly, I had a gift certificate to this place and I decided it was time to give it a shot.   I admit I was a bit irritated off the bat.  I called in my order and for some reason the first person who answered the phone couldn't take my order--even though I called the number listed for take out.  I was put on hold for about 5 minutes--foreshadowing the sh""t show I was about to get myself into.  They asked me if I wanted curbside or if I wanted to pick my food up inside.  I'm not lazy, so I told the girl I'd come in.  HUGE MISTAKE. Anyways they tell me my order will be ready in about 20 minutes.  I live like a mile from the mall and it's 730 PM so I figure, ""no problem.""  After searching for a parking spot for nearly 15 minutes, I walk into the joint.  I have never been here before so I'm looking for some sort of sign as to where I can pick up my food.  None.  So I get in line to speak to the hostess.  She tells me I can pick up my food at the bakery.  I get over by the bakery and there are people sitting on the ground waiting for a table at this joint.  Ridiculous.  Another reviewer mentioned feeling agoraphobic.  I could not agree more.  From the moment I walked in, I could not wait to get out of this place.  People everywhere.  How about an ""excuse me, sir"" instead of elbowing and pushing your way through?  I get it though you're probably pissed you've been waiting 2 hours to get a table for some food a step above Applebees in quality.   So I proceed to wait in a line for the bakery to get my takeout meal.  Mind you the reason I ordered takeout was to avoid lines and people for that matter.  How ironic I'm being smothered by people and I've been in 3 lines (if you consider waiting for a parking spot in the lot a line).  I finally get to the register and the employee is pleasant.  The hostess was pleasant too, but I'm pretty cute and we all know cute people get treated better than ugly ones.  So I am finally able to pick up my food, make the 2 block trek back to my car and get home to a barely warm meal I heated up in the Microwave.   Yes, there are certain things that I had control over in this experience.  I should have done the curbside pickup and I could avoided most of the irritation.  However, it still doesn't change the fact that the food was average, the wait mentionable and the atmosphere uncomfortable to say the least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=200

We went during happy hour so we enjoyed the buffalo blasts which are always amazing and since it was happy hr we got a full order for only $5 WOW!  For our main course we both had fish and chips which were average and typical for a large chain restaurant especially one that has such a massive menu.  The service was good and our food was out extremely fast (I'm guessing because everything we ordered was premade and just needed to be fried up for us.) The only thing that took a while was the cheese cake! It seems every time I go here it takes a good 10-20 min to get our cheesecake after we order it! It was ok though since we were already stuffed.  And the cheese cake was amazing as always! She had the red velvet which never disappoints and I had the tiramisu that I really enjoyed!

But their other food spotty and not always outstanding, their food differs somewhat from their menu, their staff disappears at times, and sometimes the little things don't come up to snuff. When we got the bread, it was not even warm.  I thought you're supposed to get warm bread at a place like this.  I was thirsty, so I went through my tea quickly, and since the staff disappeared for long stretches of time, it was empty for long stretches before and during the meal.  My burger had not only that weird special sauce, but also mayo on the other side of the patty.  I'll cop to probably missing the special sauce on the menu, but not the mayo.  They're so unnecessary, because it was such tasty meat.

I always thought this must be a decent place since many of my friends go there and wait for so long but I realize that people go there not because it is good but because there is no better restaurant in the green hills area around the mall. The portions are huge and you are almost guaranteed to ask for a box to take leftovers home. But in my opinion the quantity comes at the expense of the quality, as is usually the case. It is ordinary food, but hey what do you expect from a place as large as the cheesecake factory, it would be stupid to expect good food in such a large chain restaurant.

Elliott W.,"Franklin, TN",134,195,10,3.0,6/12/2011,"I finally decided to return to the Cheesecake Factory after a 4 year hiatus when we discovered that without reservations to our initial first choice date restaurant, we would have a 3 hour wait. Since we were passing the Green Hills mall anyway, we pulled in to the parking lot and entered the Cheesecake factory. We found a seat in the bar area very quickly and were promptly greeted by one of 2 servers who helped us. Both were very friendly and attentive. Then to the menu. I really don't know how they do this menu. It's literally about 20 pages long. Just keeping these ingredients fresh and on hand has to be a major undertaking, especially for the less popular items. Truly, it is overwhelming and could be trimmed back a little. I ended up with the garlic noodles and shrimp. It was hot and good. Not great. The shrimp were a hair tough and the asparagus so hot, i think it might have been in the microwave for a moment...It's the only way I know to get food that hot without burning it. We enjoyed a couple of Mojitos. They were very good, but for $9, they really should be. The cheesecake was excellent but sterile.  I've come to be such a fan of the Aux Choix cheesecake served at Whiskey Kitchen and the Franklin Mercantile  that Cheesecake Factory is just good but not great. In the end, Cheesecake factory is definitely a quality meal, but still a chain -- everything is just a little too predictable, too standardized, too heartless.

During my most recent visit, our table was not wiped down properly before we were seated as there were obvious crumbs on the table. The service was decent but a bit too clingy and earnest. The menu, as always, is almost overwhelming with choices but the majority of the entrees here are really good which makes up, for most people, for everything else. The Cheesecake is the big draw, but while I have never had a bad piece of cheesecake here, I don't find it so special that it is necessarily worth the price or the calories.

Joshua B.,"Nashville, TN",169,88,36,3.0,5/7/2013,"The ONLY reason this place gets 3 stars is because of the service (if it weren't for him - it'd be 2 stars). So, look - there are some reasons why you would go to Cheesecake Factory: 1.)  You are at Green Hills Mall 2.)  You really enjoy mediocre chain food 3.)  You love menus that are longer than any Harry Potter Book 4.)  You enjoy good Cheesecake 5.)  Someone gave you a gift card and you haven't been able to use it yet 6.)  You are a tourist #5 was my reason.   So, I went to my first Cheesecake factory in Atlanta years ago (and several other since).  It was ok.  Long wait, mediocre food, good cheesecake, terrible service.  When they finally came to Nashville - my boyfriend at the time and I went to check it out.  We waited for nearly 2 hours for a table.  When we were finally seated - we were seated at a 4 Top table (table large enough for 4 people).  It was a terrible table.  When we were seated - we recognized how awful the table was and asked if we could be seated at a different table.  In fact, right next to this table was another 4 Top that was much nicer.  The person that sat us rolled her eyes and said ""If you want a different table you'll have to go back up front and wait for a different table...""  What?  What difference did it make?  Why would we be required to wait longer when we already waited 2 hours.  Needless to say that attitude coupled with the mediocre food, terrible service and high price kept me away until now.  I had a gift card and, until recently, had sat in my wallet for nearly 2 years.  It was time to clean it out.  So, another trip to Cheesecake Factory was in order so I took a friend with me. This time the wait wasn't so long.  We only waited about 45 minutes.  Still, that was quite a long time to wait.  We were seated and, before long, the server was out to see us and got our drink order.   I am one of those people who drinks like a fish - so, most servers have a hard time keeping up with me.  This guy had NO problem. Many times I was taking my last sip and bam - another glass was right there.  I was impressed! We ordered our food and when it came - there were 2 problems.  First, my friend's order was wrong and second - the fries that came with my buffalo chicken sandwich were cold.  Like, not even the slightest bit warm.   Here comes the part where I was really impressed - the manager, without prompting from us, came to our table with a new plate for my roomie, realizing that the order was wrong.  I'm guessing perhaps two people ordered the same thing and they sent the wrong plate to our table.  in defense of Cheesecake factory - he ordered a dish with chicken and shrimp and asked for just chicken.  It came with both...so, it's not the way it's traditionally served.  But, they had the correct order on the table just moments after the 'wrong' one arrived.  Nice! I never did complain about my fries because, after all, I was just here trying to spend a gift card and I'd likely never come back anyway.  So, I was afraid if I complained they might take it off my order and then I'd be left with more money to spend...and I didn't want that. All in all - the service was impressive, the food was blah and the cheesecake was, of course, incredible.   If you want a good place to eat in Nashville - this is NOT it.  If you want a place to get a good piece of cheesecake - by all means - stop by.   I really do wish that server the best, though.  He was incredible.  But, other than the cheesecake and the service - I have never, ever found a reason, food wise, to return.  The food is overpriced and of mediocre quality.  The food seems very chain-like and corporate.  AKA - nothing to write home about.   But, if you fit one of the 6 reasons above to go - by all means...Just be expected to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=180

The ceiling is unrealistically high, so the place is noisy, and the décor would be a bit unsettling if you could see it.   On to the service.  We went on a Friday evening and very surprisingly, we didn't have much of a wait.  It didn't hurt that there were only two of us and we were willing to take a table in the bar.  Our waiter was Jason and he was phenomenal.   And the food.  I don't know jacket-boo about wine, so I don't know if the house merlot was good or bad, but it went nicely with bread and butter.  And the bread was warm.  My wife's chicken thing was delicious, and there was a full paddy of rice to go with it.  She took a good bit of it home.  My ribeye steak was huge, and I finished it only because I was under the impression that it might be free if I could do so in under an hour. Despite being REALLY full, we ordered desert, because, well, duh.  My wife had some sort of chocolate coconut cheesecakey delight.  It also was huge, and a lot of it came home with us.  I asked Jason for the highest calorie desert on the menu and he brought me red velvet cheesecake.  Time stopped.  I considered eating the plate.

Patrick H.,"CANE RIDGE, TN",22,21,1,2.0,6/27/2012,"I hear a lot of people talk about The Cheesecake Factory and on how great it is. I don't see what all the hype is all about really. Great how??? Decided to go on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm. First off, we had to wait about 30 min to be seated. I got a great view of seeing people enter and exit the restaurant every 5 seconds. Plus, it was raining and we couldn't wait in the lobby because there were 50 people waiting to be seated and about 20 people waiting to get cheesecake. After the wait, we had to go searching for the host and finally we heard him screaming over the crowd. We were seated next to two other couples. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria. I could reach over and slap the woman next to me or eat off her plate if I wanted to...but I would never do anything that crazy, but you get the idea. We were that close to each other. I really didn't like the fact we were able to hear other people's conversation in full detail. This place is extremely loud. You can't keep anything private unless you're in your own booth, which, that's where I wish we were. The table was small and before the server finally arrived at our table, I was ready to go. I got frustrated going through the menu and I wanted it to be over, so I decided to get the Smoke Burger, or whatever it's called. I've had a better burger at Burger King and I think the fries were just ok. I'm sure other things on the menu are good, but I'll never find out. The only reason I'm giving this two stars and not one is because the server was really nice and professional. The food was at our table fast and she did a good job checking on us to see if we needed anything. She was tipped very well and if I knew her name, I would name drop and give her kudos for her hard work. My opinion, go to Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake only and get it to go! If you like waiting, loud conversation, food that you could probably get better at Applebee's and bumping into people, go for it. Don't believe the hype!!

Matthew D.,"Venice, CA",69,228,33,2.0,8/2/2010,"After watching my boss spend $2k on a piece of CARRY-ON LUGGAGE at Louis Vuitton, we both decided our cheapest option to kill time before dinner would be at the bar. Enter Charles, the Cheesecake Factory bartender. The man has a heavy hand with the Maker's, I'll tell you what. Three Maker's and Cokes laid me out for the night and I'm a big guy. We ended up getting a table for our group of ten. After that, all I remember is ordering the Cajun Jambalaya pasta, eating some of it (reliably tasty) and getting stuck with the check for the table (despite my president and senior vp being there). Oh yeah, I had some cheesecake too but they wouldn't let us order some new peanut butter cheesecake because we didn't become fans on Facebook and print a screenshot to prove it. I believe the new flavor was going to be released to the general public in a few days. Let me tell you, this really pissed me off when I remembered that it happened. I f***ing hate exclusive promotions like this, especially when there is a big sign in the lobby touting the new cheesecake. They lose a star because of that bullshit.

Anonymous P.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,38,,2.0,2/25/2010,"Sometimes, instead of trying out the local grub scene, one goes to a chain restaurant to look for some consistency.  That's why tourists go to McDonald's in England, because English food sucks, and you can always rely on a Big Mac to taste like a Big Mac no matter what you think of a Big Mac. Ergo, the Cheesecake Factory.  A restaurant chain, where in theory, no matter where you are, every restaurant should look the same, and the food should taste the same.  The Cheesecake Factory in Green Hills was just nasty.  Nasty service, nasty food...damn, how can you mess up on Vietnamese Spring Rolls?   Our main courses sucked mega balls too.  Worst yet everything came out on time except for one plate - which came 15 minutes later - which meant that the rest of us waited for the final plate to come out - which meant our meals were cold by the time we started eating. The thing is, the people who work there walk around like ""We're Cheesecake.  We're the shit.  Our food is awesome."" When in reality, yes, it is the Cheesecake Factory, but the only thing that is shit is the quality of the food.   Now where's that Big Mac?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=240
Kate C.,"Antioch, TN",56,5,2,1.0,11/18/2012,"A group of 10 of us decided to celebrate a friend's birthday at this restaurant. We chose valet parking. We arrived at 6:30 PM, fully aware that there would be a hefty wait, but we were willing because everyone loves the Cheesecake Factory experience. We were told there would be a 2.5 hr wait and shortly after we were told it was dropped down to 1.5 hr. About every 30 min we would check in to see what the wait was and we were constantly told ""About 20 min"". We were finally seated at 9 PM. It took approximately 15 min for water to be served and bread to be brought to our table. Everyone ordered a round of drinks and it took another 20 minutes for those to arrive. When my friend asked if there were gluten free options, our waitress, Dawn, told her that she couldn't guarantee anything and she would be taking a gamble with anything she ordered. My friend, who rarely comes out because of anxiety, was treated with an incredible amount of disrespect and left her irritated and stressed about dinner the rest of the night. At this point, I went and talked to the manager to let him know what the waitress said. As we ordered our dinner, we also ordered a second round of drinks. Menus were never taken away from our table and appetizer dishes were stacked high before they were cleared away. Dinner came, we all finished our food and plates were cleared away before our drinks even arrived. At that point, no one cared to have another drink, but since the drinks are priced so high we didn't have a choice. I left the table again to talk to a different manager, Travis. I told him about our experience and how we were extremely disappointed with our service. I let him know that we were all willing to wait the long amount of time because we all love this restaurant but the experience once we sat down was completely unacceptable. He apologized and was very gracious. He offered to buy everyone's dessert and also was going to take off the auto 18% tip. When we asked for dessert menus, 1 was brought to us for a table of 10. Another 20 minutes went by before we were able to order. Our dessert came out one by one, making the night even slower. Had our waitress been bringing us our bills at that point we would have been able to speed the process up. Instead we had to track her down. She was tipped poorly by everyone. By the time we left the restaurant it was 11:35 PM. The valet service closed at 9:30 PM. We were the only car left and the employee had to wait only for us. Our plans to go out after dinner for my friends birthday were ruined because we spent over 5 hours at dinner for what was the absolute worst dining experience myself and the others in the group have ever had ANYWHERE. We chose The Cheesecake Factory because we have all been avid fans of it for over 10 years. This experience was unacceptable and the chance of me dining at that location is very slim.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=240

Their brown bread that they serve before your meal comes is absolutely fantastically delicious (especially if it's nice and warm). My family and I went there last night and it was PACKED. They said it was a two-hour wait, so we watched the bar area like a hawk until a table opened up (didn't want to wait two hours, and bar seating allows you to grab a table once someone is finished--just be diligent about it). We got a fantastic server, who happily complied with our specific requests (only brown bread, please!) and at the end of our meal, he gave us a whole loaf of brown bread to take home. Now THAT'S customer service!! We left happy, satisfied, and quite full.

Sara T.,"Nashville, TN",0,7,,2.0,4/10/2009,"I usually steer clear of chains, but decided to come here because it was a good mutual meeting place for a friend and I. It was empty, around 4:30pm, with quite a few staff standing around looking for stuff to do. We came for apps and drinks, so I couldn't vouch for the rest of the menu.  Now, I set my expectations pretty low for this place, so I can't really say I was disappointed by much. But, I was a little suprised by how greasy everything was.  We sat in the bar and got the cuban sandwiches, the avocado eggrolls, the chicken quesadillas and drinks. My friend seemed to enjoy her mojito, and I had a beer.   The cuban sandwiches were suprisingly tasty (or maybe I was just hungry,) but the buns were slathered w/ grease or butter or something. I enjoyed them, but they kind of sat like a rock in my gut.  The avocado eggrolls were SUPER heavy. Obviously, the eggroll wrapper was fried, but I expected that, being an eggroll.  But, what I didn't expect was that the filling was pretty much ALL avocado.  Now, I LOVE avocado, but the menu says that there is sun dried tomatoes, cilantro, and onion in the eggroll, so I was expecting more of a veggie mix.  I didn't taste anything other than avocado in the filling. And it was just TOO rich and fatty with the fried shell. But, the tamarind dip was kind of good, and interesting w/ the avocado. I didn't expect much from the quesadillas (they are all the same, to me) so I will reserve harsh judgement. But, again, the outer tortillas were super greasy and seemed to be fried in an excess of oil.  Why not bake a quesadilla?? The staff was SUPER attentive (almost too much so,) and super UNprofessional.  Some guy came over to our table (after we had already had 2 other servers come by,) and just kind of hung out, talking about random crap. It was weird. After we got our apps and were enjoying our drinks, some other guy came by and grabbed our app plate while we were still eating it. I stopped him from taking it (which TOTALLY put me in an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation!) Then, the second the food was off the plates (I was still holding part of an eggroll,) he came by and took the plates again!!! I let him take it that time, and used my napkin as a plate.  The food wasn't really bad, it was just really cheap and greasy tasting. Not fresh. Kinda like dive bar food. The seating was uncomforable in the bar... super high stools with your back open to a lot of open space.  I may be back because of the covenience of the location (for drinks only,) but not for food....

Even though there were lots of people waiting to be seated we were able to be seated almost right away due to the fact that there were only two of us and the others waiting were groups of 8 plus. Our server greeted us as we were seated, drinks and bread arrived promptly thereafter and the appetizer we ordered came in just a few minutes.

We only finished half took the rest too go along with dessert which was delicious too. They have a wide selection on the menu so almost everyone is sure to find something they could like and of course as the name implies they have a great selection of delicious cheesecakes!

Gabrielle T.,"New York, NY",8,29,2,4.0,1/1/2013,"So a friend suggested that we go to The Cheesecake Factory as my birthday outing dinner choice, and I wasn't disappointed! We did have a short wait (30 minutes), but it was New Year's Eve, so it was to be expected. It's usually a good sign for a restaurant if there is a wait, though, right? Anywho, firstly - this is very ridiculous of me, but also a sign of how easy I am to impress: they serve bread - two kinds in fact! One brown-in-color with grains scattered about here and there, and your run of the mill Italian style loaf. Unfortunately I'm one of those customers that becomes quietly disgruntled if there isn't bread. Sad I know. It's the little things. I'll continue to the juice, the important part if you will.  I did not like how close we sat to other tables...it's the style where there's one seating rail against a wall, and little two-seater tables lined up with about 21/2 feets space between the other man's table on either side, and a on the opposite end of table. I understand this is typical some places, but when you're out for dinner and not at a bar, you generally don't want to hear your neighbors' conversation or vice versa. The server was friendly and accommodating. We never felt rushed, which I strongly appreciate. When I go out to dinner, I despise the feeling of ""okay, you're done - now please leave because we need turnover."" The food: I had the grilled veggie burger accompanied by a salad with vinaigrette dressing as my main entree, ordered from 'The Skinnylicious' menu. While I know it might not sound appealing to a lot - YUM! Very flavorful and delicious. The salad consisted of a fluffy, deceivingly generous portion of rich-in-color mixed greens, with a tomato or two, dowsed in the vinaigrette dressing. I assumed it would taste as one would expect - nothing to write home about, it's lettuce, right? That dressing was amazing! I don't love vinaigrettes, though I'm trying to. But this one was on the mark. Unique and delicious. Oh, and for drink I had the strawberry lemonade, which was seriously addictive. I went through a solid 3 refills without a problem in an embarrassingly short amount of time. Onto the cheesecake: I ordered the tiramisu cheesecake, and my friend ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. The carrot cake cheesecake was okay, however the tiramisu was decadent! So yum! As an added yay!-point, My cheesecake came with a candle in whipped cream, lighted by the server at the table, and ""Happy Birthday!"" written in chocolate sauce around the plate. It's the little things!  In conclusion - beautiful restaurant, great service, delicious food with tables slightly too close for comfort (in my case). I would recommend anyone going here.

An blue tower with glittering lights that look like stars adorns the high double doored entryway. High windows, and high ceilings that stretch two or three stories. Beautiful art, marble, huge mirrors, and windows.  The vastness and beauty makes it feel as if you are dining in some kind of exotic palace. The menu is a small book! They offer the huge variety of dishes with very large portions, if you have ever ate at a Cheesecake Factory before you will recognize the dishes. If not then you will have to eat there to understand the variety!  The food for me is great. For such a large restaurant the food tastes as if a lot of attention was paid to detail, and I almost have always had great food eating there. I have developed a liking to three or four particular dishes.  I love the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, which is a great Caribbean dish for a chain restaurant. The Chicken Madeira is a huge favorite among mostly everyone who dines there, and has a very unique taste. If you like sushi or don't mind trying raw tuna, I highly recommend their Ahi Carpaccio which is a thin slice of raw Ahi tuna. It actually tastes very good even those who did not like sushi that I got to try it liked it quiet a bit.  The service itself is so-so here. They are usually very busy so are not able to pay a lot of personal attention. We really liked a few of the waiters who seemed very friendly, but several have left or were not there when we were. The hostesses are generally very accommodating and friendly though, and even if you miss a page they will allow you to sit immediately sometimes. The only real negative about the place is the wait on the weekends and some busy weekday evenings. It can be 1 to 2 hours or even more on their busiest weekends so just be aware! You can walk around the mall with the waiting pager and I have found it goes off even in Macy's. The mall closes at 9 though. This is also a great place to eat on the weekends since they close fairly late, I believe 12:30 on Saturday nights!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=220
Sarah S.,"Nashville, TN",0,22,,1.0,11/4/2009,"I have had many dinners and lunches here, none of which have blown me away...just kind of been so-so.  I tried to eat dinner here this past weekend after catching a movie and the wait was not bad-30 minutes and we were seated in 15.  The problem came when we were seated.   There were two of us and we were seated a TINY table on top of two other tables (there was absolutely no way we could have had 2 entrees, 2 glass of water and 2 glases of wine on the table at once).  We could not even hear each other speak we were so close to the other tables.  Our table also had a large chunk of it missing from the corner which was sharp and the table itself was incredibly wobbly.  We asked our server if we could move, she politely brought us back to the front where we were told we would have to wait again, despite seeing multiple tables being cleaned and empty as we walked from the back to the front.  In the end, we decided that we were not going to wait again so we left. I do not understand how people wait for hours to eat at this place...the food is nothing special and service has never been exceptional either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=220
Josh R.,"Nashville, TN",0,14,,4.0,4/5/2008,"8000 decent options.  7000 include grilled chicken. Girlfriend and I went for drinks after a movie tonight.  Thank you cheesecake, for frosting my beer mugs and giving me a deliciously cold beer.   Appetizers: The corn tamale cakes and the avocado rolls are amazing.  Perhaps not $20 amazing, but still pretty good. All said and done, Cheesecake has lots of good options, lots of good deserts, but it just slight to pricey to justify it all.  Oh, and did I mention you might have to wait for eternity to get a seat?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=220
T. C.,"Sacramento, CA",37,165,61,5.0,4/22/2008,"I know it's a chain.  I know it's not even cool to give a chain restaurant five stars.  But I must.  Because I love their ginormous portions.  And their wildly overpriced but yummy fruity cocktails.  And their BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad rocks my world.  And of course (of COURSE) their cheesecake. Downsides to this particular Cheesecake Factory?  It's still a relative novelty in Tennessee so the wait is RIDONKULOUS.  Be prepared to wait.  And if you can't wait, check out Carraba's just down the way at the end of the mall (by the bank).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=220
Kevin M.,"Mt Juliet, TN",1,23,2,2.0,1/2/2011,"The wait at this particular one is horrific, and the waiters are slow as molasses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville?start=220
