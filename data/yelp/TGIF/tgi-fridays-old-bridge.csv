Angel T.,"South Amboy, NJ",118,192,93,3.0,3/14/2017,"Ok first and foremost, before I even get started with the food, I have to say that I am very put off by the fact that when I swipe my credit card in the tablet, my bill was about $41 or $42 and it came up 20% or $10.28 for the tip, which you can adjust but that's not the correct amount.  It would be $8 and change.  Very shady.  Also it's another restaurant with a tablet, with no sign saying you will be charged for games your kids play.   Ok onto the food.  I had fajitas, they were really good,  honestly just as good as most Mexican restaurants.  I had the chicken and steak combo.  Their grilled chicken is delicious, I don't know what they marinade it in but the cook it perfect it is so juicy! Hubby got unlimited apps for $10, that didn't strike me as the best deal, there is like 6 things to choose from (all the cheap things) and the first round is a full platter and after that, just a little plate, think all you can eat ribs.   To me getting that big appetizer mix platter is a much better deal at I think $15.   Good kids meals.  My daughters chicken fingers were delicious.   Really awesome server he totally deserved the inflated tip that Friday's automatically puts on lol!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Vickie B.,"Sayreville, NJ",8,64,15,2.0,7/27/2017,"Service at the bar is terrible  Staff is more interested in socializing with each other  Bartender on her phone and now has vanished from the bar for 10 minutes and I am waiting to pay  Chicken fingers are gross  Update I came here at 4:30 on 7/2717 for Happy hour. (No food). Young man at the bar very nice and attentive  Same usual two  female bartenders came on  shortly after (I guess for the night shift)and same old thing.  Still a Social club for the staff (at least at the bar). I wanted to order another drink but of course they were too busy chatting with each other to notice my glass was empty for 10 minutes. Finally got one bartender attention by waiving.   I don't care that the staff has a good time working together, but not to the detriment of the patrons. When will the management finally do something about this??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Tara M.,"Monroe, NJ",344,323,954,3.0,1/7/2017,"TGIF it is what it is.  Chain restaurant. I usually don't like this place for obvious reasons. I went with a large group. The waiter had a hard time keeping up with drink orders and normal serving stuff (napkins, silverware,refills etc) Pot stickers, Jack Daniel wings, spinach dip and more were ordered. The pot stickers were decent. I ordered jack Daniel's burger which seemed to be safest thing to order. It was actually cooked okay could've been a little more rare. The flavor was spot on with the jack Daniel's sauce. It was juicy with lettuce,tomato and onion. The fries were crispy but overly seasoned and a tad too salty for me. Someone ordered the pecan crusted chicken salad and it looked delish. She finished it and said it was delicious. They have a kiosk on the table so you can pay while you're still seated. Which was kinda neat. Would I go back? If I was forced too..the apps were okay so maybe for them. But not on my top ten list...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Angelynn Á.,"Hartford, CT",216,89,305,4.0,10/11/2016,"This is a decent place to grab a few drinks and have a meal with friends and/or family. They have a huge variety of drinks, the environment is lively, the waiters and staff was friendly and attentive, and the drinks and food are reasonably priced. Even though the food is quite mediocre (which is expected from any TGI Fridays), this is one of the best late-night options for food and drinks in Old Bridge since it's one of the only restaurants open after midnight every night. The restaurant also has karaoke nights on some nights, which makes the ambience more fun and social. During one of the recent times I visited, I was *starving*, so I ordered the ""Steak & Lobster"" dish with a side of ""Fresh Spinach"" and ""Tomato Mozzarella Salad"". The steak was a bit chewy for my liking but they at least got the order correct of having it medium-rare (as requested). The lobster was pretty good and sizable, and it went very well with the butter sauce that was included. The ""Tomato Mozzarella Salad"" was basically mozzarella caprese, just with grape tomatoes and small mozzarella balls. The ""Fresh Spinach"" was very tasty , and it came with cheese, garlic, and mushrooms.  During another time I visited, my friends and I decided to get the ""You Pick 4"" appetizers, and we ordered boneless wings, crispy green bean fries, loaded potato skins (sans the bacon), and mozzarella sticks. The boneless wings and loaded potato skins were average, but we really *really* liked the mozzarella sticks and the crispy green bean fries. The crispy green bean fries tasted great on its own, but they tasted much better when dipped into the ""Ranch & Wasabi"" dip that was included with the appetizer.  If you like pumpkin, I highly recommend the Pumpkin Cake Shots, which is available during the fall. The shots were delicious and the pumpkin flavor was quite prominent. My friends and I enjoyed the flavor so much that we kind of wished there was a regular drink size option for the shot.  All in all, I would recommend this place to my friends in the Old Bridge area who want a *very local* place to grab a drink, and for those who don't want to travel far. Even though the food isn't amazing, this place is very convenient to those who live in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Neil S.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,23,1,1.0,11/27/2016,"Another visit to TGI Fridays, and another disappointment. I was here on a Sunday for football, and asked what the beer specials were. I was told one price for the beer, and was charged $2 more. When I asked why it was so much, the bartender told me she made a mistake and told me the wrong price and apologized. That's fair, but why do I have to pay the extra fee when she made a mistake. If I was told the right price, I would have ordered something different. You would think that someone who works for tips at a large corporation (which has already been sanctioned for shady practices  ) would amend the mistake for a repeat customer, but not all the bartenders understand what customer service is.  We also had to wait way too long to order food, and when I looked around I saw the bartender was on break eating. Considering the kitchen crew brings out the food, it seems like it would have been a better idea to take our order and then go eat, instead of making us wait 15 minutes for you to finish.  The prices have all raised for the same food which was never that great, and the new TVs are a nice addition. I will be taking my business to the 404 Bar in Sayreville which has a much friendlier environment and better prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Jackie G.,"South Amboy, NJ",86,17,,2.0,8/31/2017,"Our waitress was just terrible! We ordered some easy items- fried shrimp, soup, and salad. Took forever for it to arrive. Then, when I ordered the Oreo Madness dessert, the waitress brought me a gross melted version of what once was an Oreo Madness.

Anonymous A.,"Matawan, NJ",0,12,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Unfortunately I need to write this review. This is our local Fridays and we were so lucky cause they WERE wonderful. Tonight, workers received the following benefits...free drinks starting at 1:40am while customers were still in the restaurant and I'm pretty sure against corporate policy, smoking weed by the back door as it wafted throughout the restaurant, bar service to the restaurant while patrons were ignored at the bar, and clean-up absolutely took priority to customer service...bartenders started cleaning around 1:00am, took 20 minutes to get a drink and by then it was practically last call because 10 minutes later lights were on. Incredibly unprofessional and loss of revenue should have this manager's attention. What a shame, please straighten this place up before there are more complaints and you're out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Jennifer C.,"Parlin, NJ",0,25,,2.0,4/11/2017,"They renovated, and raised the prices...a lot. I thought the apps were expensive. Place looked nice and was clean. But the food was average at best.

Sweta V.,"Parlin, NJ",0,1,,1.0,10/3/2016,"Me and my Bf decided to grab a quick dinner before the movies and guess what the same hostess was working that day and did the same exact thing she did 5 months ago. As soon as we walked in she gave my Bf a big smile. She passed by a few time with a big smile on he face. Then she went back to the front and kept staring at my bf. My Bf told me that when I went to the ladies room she came to him and asked him if he needs anything else, (that's not her job) then she was just trying to have a conversation with him.he told me that she was flirting with him.  I am really disappointed because I spoke to the branch manager about this and nothing changed. This is unacceptable. I mean come in together sometimes we hold hands, We always share an appetizer, We always sit next to each other. Why does she think that he is single? This has happened before but this time she really crossed the line when  she was flirting with him when I went to the ladies room.  She even asked him if we are paying together. WE ALWAYS PAY TOGETHER. When she hangs out in the front, She won't STOP staring at my bf. NO she is NOT being friendly. I don't see her do this anyone else.  Also she is a hostess not a waitress so she is not flirting with him for Tips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Patrick H.,"Old Bridge, NJ",13,59,10,3.0,6/29/2016,"I've come here a few times before , this is the first time I felt I needed to share. First of all the place has an overall ""sticky"" feeling, it's clean don't get me wrong but the atmosphere is just ""sticky"". Now I sat at the bar most visits and this time it was a bit loud not from people but from music. Not a bad thing but it was way toooo empty on the dining room side so we sat at the bar. When we sat we were greeted right away however it seemed as there was only 1 person tending bar. It had quite a few people so I was a bit concerned . Our drinks were made great and food came out reasonably fast. But again the atmosphere with the stickiness just lingered",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Brett K.,"Parlin, NJ",3,44,,4.0,1/10/2016,"The goal this year is to try as many new (to me/us) restaurants as possible, repeating/visiting established favorites only when somehow warranted by circumstance. Pascal and Sabine, Poached Pear, maybe start taking on Montclair or finally make it to Watermark for a drink. So last night's destination...TGI Friday's. My life is just a little sad... But, to get it out of the way, after avoiding this chain for a long time due to its offering no vegetarian option of interest, I went specifically to try its Sedona black bean burger, and I'm essentially reviewing this one dish as there was otherwise nothing noteworthy or unexpected for a chain in either direction about my experience here last night. That said...Served with balsamic glazed onions, avocado, jack and Cheddar, chipotle mayo, and iceberg lettuce and tomato, though different from Houlihan's excellent garden burger, this option is juicy (rare in a restaurant vegetarian burger) and quite definitely as good if not better. And it's worth a little bit of humiliation to note that for any vegetarians in need of a quick, hearty, inexpensive meal, this is an extremely satisfying choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge
Joe D.,"Hightstown, NJ",45,7,1,5.0,12/4/2015,"I been here a lot of times, always a pretty good experience except one time. I don't want to focus on that. I have to say that Pelli is a great waiter. I am a regular here and he has been my waiter a handful of times. He is very efficient, friendly and kind. It's pretty amazing when he can remember your drink order and bring it to you without even telling him!  I haven't seen him for awhile but he is here tonight and we almost didn't have him as a waiter. I am thankful we changed our seat from the bar area which is extremely loud and hard to talk anyway.  The food is always great and comes out nice and hot. I love coming to Friday's, I believe it's one of the better chains out there compared to Applebees or Buffalo Wild Wings.

It basically gives you points towards free food, if you come often it makes sense to sign up for the free membership.

Eric Y.,"Old Bridge, NJ",42,167,107,3.0,6/6/2012,"There are many chain restaurants around town. This is one of them and depends on the time you go, the food might be cooked differently. During busy hours, the food tends to not be as well cooked as times as not as busy because the chefs are rushing and are not as careful as they should be. Even if you go late at night when there isn't a lot of people in the eating area (away from bar) they cook a lot better. Depends on the wait(er/ress), some are very good in doing their job. When I went, there was half off appetizers which was the best thing because usually the appetizers are about $8 for one, and paying $4 was a deal!  For the food, what my table ordered was, mozzarella sticks, fried potato skins, buffalo wings, oven-baked flatbread with spinach on top/etc, korean steak tacos, flat iron steak, and bruschetta chicken pasta. The Korean Steak Tacos are very good but you should not get the hot sauce on top because it over takes the flavor of the entire taco. The oven-bake flatbread is delicious with how thin and crispy it is. The flat iron steak was cooked perfectly, the way that I wanted ( usually during when there is a lot of people in the restaurant, they over cook it) the Chicken past was delicious too.  This place is a great place to go if you can not thing of anywhere else to go. It is great to just relax and talk without anyone bothering you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-old-bridge?start=20
