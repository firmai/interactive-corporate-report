Oh and the Lakers are playing. Finding parking was a nightmare. Circled around like for 10 minutes. I just decided to park closer towards Macy's and walk over. Walked in and it was a full house. Good thing my friends got there early and were already seated. Sat down and the waiter came to see what I wanted to drink - I asked for a coke and he thinks hes funny and says ""ok 1 jack and coke"".   Placed our orders and it took awhile for the food to come out. I went with the Texas Style Chicken fried steak. Dry....not enough gravy....mash potatoes were ""warm"" at best. Service was good til our waiter went on break - his replacement ""Sam"" (very pretty girl) didnt really show up much. She kinda disappeared.  Food - could've been better.

360,Gloria R.,"Downey, CA",505,455,2301.0,1.0,2012-02-16,"First off let me start by saying I love to come to BJ's Restaurants and I have been to quite a few. I am not sure why I continue to frequent this particular restaurant. Each time I come to this restaurant I have encountered such poor service and incompetent servers. The wait time is horrible even if you call ahead and they give you an estimated time you will still have to wait the time they tell you when you actually arrive. So there is no point in calling ahead. Today my son and I decided to come because we haven't been here in quite some time and figured something should have changed since our last visit but no it is still the same. We decide to sit in the bar area in a booth as suggested by the hostess as service would be quicker. But no, we sat at the table for 11 minutes (yes, I timed it) before I had to go and complain before we were even greeted or offered drinks. Seriously? 11 minutes that is ridiculous!!! So finally they send someone over to greet us and apologize. We ordered our drinks and food as my son always orders the same thing. But the food takes even longer which is surprising since the place was practically empty. The food was overcooked and dry. Very disappointed:( My son didn't even finish his food. I will remember not to come to this particular restaurant again due to continued disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=440,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.5320000000000005,3.4800000000000004

The place is great from the inside, the lighting is just perfect. The greeting was welcoming and friendly. We requested booth seating and this was accommodated with pleasure. We enjoyed great dishes, the Calamari was fantastic, the deep dish pizza was very good, the chicken fettuccine pasta was a little below average to our taste because it was rather dry.

464,Keith B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",8,14,3.0,2.0,2012-08-19,"Just don't go for Brunch. Sunday morning NFL games in this restaurant have never been great, but in this season, they are worse than ever. A group of 5 went on 9/11/11 and this is what we found. First, there is a new corporate policy of no audio of the NFL games. Instead you get to hear the standard background music just loud enough to make it hard to hear those around you. That makes watching the games difficult, but what is excruciating is the poor service and general ""why are you making me work"" attitude of the staff. Some examples include : We never played the audio of the games. Otherwise everyone would be trying to get their games on. -oh you haven't decided yet? -when the food didn't come out, the manager was nice but the waitress would not accept reponsibility and just put it back on us saying ""well I kept asking if you needed anything..."" terrible. -when asked if the coffee could be warmed up, the waitress tried to convince us it was hot because she burned her hand... nonsense. When we asked about their amber beers, the waitress said they didn't have any. When we looked at the menu and picked one she tried to explain that ""that beer is only amber in color"" WHAT?

70,Jenni M.,"Downey, CA",425,684,2351.0,2.0,2013-03-15,"So I went here with my husband because he & a co-worker always stop by one of these if they are having a late afternoon lunch. This was my first time in this restaurant. It was the evening of February 26, 2013 at about 6:30. Place was not really packed at that time. If I liked beer, I'd probably have something to say about the selections, but I don't. I just know that my husband likes the Jeremiah Red beer.  So, a key notes... The hostess & our waitress were friendly & got the job done. Restrooms were decent. The avocados on my California chicken sandwich were green and fresh. The fries I got were the super thin, crispy ones. They were good.  Now for my seemingly harsh critique... I hoped for much more roasted green chiles (I noticed they spelled it ""chilies"" on their menu--say what??) than they put on it, but I'm not where near Hatch, New Mexico, to school them on the glory that is green chile. The chicken was cooked fine, but the sourdough bread was saturated with grease. Ultimately, I was totally turned off by the fact, though, that my first set of silverware was dirty. The leftover food on the fork surely would've been too easy to see as they were rolling them up because I saw it before having even unwrapped the napkin. Then there was something floating in my lemonade that shouldn't have been there. Maybe it was like pepper or something, but how the heck did it get there?

334,Angel C.,"Downey, CA",0,10,2.0,2.0,2013-06-13,"So, we had a high school grad that decided he wanted to eat here. Let me start by saying that the hostess said it'd be a 30 minute wait. Of course, an hour later, our large party started getting frustrated because we were told they were waiting for two girls to finish eating  to clear up an area for us. Surprise, surprise-- they finished and then sat another party that arrived after us there. As we asked why that happened, the manager told us they honor reservations first. Wtf, she could have said that before pissing us all off. The staff simply doesn't know how to communicate clear expectations with their clients. We were finally seated in two separate areas. Our waitress was ok but seemed too stressed for a large group. I personally had to ask 3 different employees, including the manager, to change a channel to the Dodger game.They all said yes and never did. I hate to be an AHole, so I let it go. Other TVs away from us had the game going. So this is what prompted me to write this review and knocked a few stars down in the service department. The manager did send some courtesy avocado egg rolls after we ordered. That was kind of her; she later did come to apologize about the fiasco. However, you can't excuse poor service because the restaurant is busy. Later, we got a different server to replace our first, and he was great! He even brought out complimentary deserts for our graduate. I was at one star at the time. The food was average. My cheese and tomato pizza wasn't any better than Pizza Hut's, but the beer and wine was good. The prices are reasonable as well. The environment was clean but I personally don't like to be surrounded by cholitos, so I'd go elsewhere. So if you want great service here, don't get your hopes too high.

258,Catherine J.,"Downey, CA",35,23,6.0,1.0,2013-09-01,"This review is based on the most recent dining experience I had with my family. Previous experiences were always great but this time around my mother found something in her food that caused her to bleed.  When we got to this location, there wasn't much of a wait and not very many people. We were a party of six and we were seated in the middle of the aisle where two tables were pushed together. There were plenty of booths open and we felt incredibly squished in-between this aisle where customers were passing through as well as the servers.  We asked for a booth but apparently they were saving them for some customers that just walked which in that case, we should have been seated there first.  Anyway, on to the food. We all ordered different items but I'm going to speak specifically about what was found in my dads portion of onion strings. Now, my dad had not tried his onion strings yet but my mom grabbed the first bite of the finger food.  As she bit into the onion string, she bit into something hard. Then she spit out what she was chewing and revealed what looked like a piece of rock. As we looked closer, it had the color of ceramic so we thought she might have just broken her tooth. She was still complaining about a pain in her gums so I decided to accompany her to the restroom. That's when she pulled out another piece of ceramic that was stuck in the back of her gums. Then she started bleeding. We made sure to check if it wasn't a broken tooth and it wasn't so we returned to the table and I called the manager over.  We showed her the piece of ceramic and the damage that had occurred to my mom and she went to the back kitchen to speak to the staff. Once she left, we found more pieces of ceramic on my mothers plate and kept them to show the manager. When she came back, she told us it looked like a piece of tooth and we told her it wasn't because we already checked to make sure. We told her it looked like pieces of broken plate because the color of the ceramic was the same color as the plates that they use to serve their food. We told her that she should be aware that they are discarding broken plates right away and not serving anything to a customer if something had been broken.  She made my mom file a report because there was blood involved and she comped some of our dishes for us. We hope to never find anymore hazardous material in our food or to any other customers as it could potentially kill someone if they swallowed a piece of broken ceramic.  Be aware of the onion strings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=320,2.6,3.21,3.21,2.6920000000000006,2.9659999999999997
177,Joseph B.,"Malibu, CA",1,74,8.0,4.0,2013-09-07,"Came here Friday to have a cool drink and watch the Dodgers play. I sat at  the Bar as the booths and tables were occupied and since I was by myself, sans wingman DCR, being a conscientious, sentient being I didn't wish to monopolize seating that was intended for more than a single customer. Anyhow, Stacy was the Bartender and very attentive. Again, the BJs employees at the Downey restaurant truly comprehend customer service.  A customer walked in and sat next to me. He kinda resembled my wing DCR. I'll call this customer Mr. Oblivious. Anyhow, small talk ensued. he talked about getting ink of  a Unicorn with Patrick Swayze on the back. Creepy (this was the first omen). The Dodgers were winning, I ordered a second one.  Then....Mr. Oblivious receives a phone call. He starts talking while he is sitting at the Bar. His volume grew to the decibel level comparable to sitting front row at a Metallica concert. I discretely asked Stacy for some cocktail napkins and stuffed them in my right ear (Mr. Oblivious was sitting on my right). As his volume increased, I covered my right ear with my hand and still, his conversation was deafening.  The game was in the second inning when he received the call. When he ended the call, the game was in the 7th inning. All the customers around him were giving him evil looks, one Latina was saying a prayer hoping for some divine intervention to end the call (like the battery dying on his White Galaxy S3). The white phone should have been a second omen. How many 50 something, non metro, males carry a white phone???? Finally, the conversation ended. Hallelujah. Thank you Ms. Latina for beginning the Novena. Some of the highlights of the conversation (that  everyone in the bar was able to hear) were: The name of the caller - Sally and her relationship to Mr. Oblivious Her latest gynecological test results (she is okay, just a routine test, no UTIs) A Tamale recipe (the proper method to stuff a Tamale) The new iPhone 5 S/C The weather (SoCal heat wave. Really?, thanks for the update Genius) Sally's grandchild's bout with diarrhea (a young child should not eat salsa and chips) Miley Cyrus twerking at the VMA A recent sighting of a Pod of Orcas off Malibu Retirement Account options (401ks, Keogh/Roth IRAs, CDs, Mutual funds) The Kardashians new addition Nori West Aaron Hernandez' not guilty plea President Obamas options for Syria Favorite Reality TV shows (at this point my ears began to bleed). Thankfully the call ended. Mr. Oblivious  looks around and notices that I have napkins stuffed in both ears. ""WAS I LOUD?"" he asked From the other side of the bar area, Stacy, the bartender, responded, ""NO, BUT PLEASE SHARE SALLY'S TAMALE RECIPE WITH ALL OF US"". I finished my beer and left.

When she came we asked where it was and she was like oh you ordered an appetizer ?  We were mad but we let it slide and told her the appetizer. A few minutes later a bartender said that the computer was supposedly broken and needed our appetizer order. We were furious so we went and talked to a manger and explained to him that we didn't want anything free but that we were servers and that the service was so bad so he said he would bring our appetizer out. After we ate our appetizer she came and dropped our bill off without even asking if we needed anything. So we asked where our pizza was and her face was in complete shock because she had forgotten. She took the bill and left and had a different server come to us and say that the computer was broken and that they needed our order again so we told the manager that we weren't going to pay for any of it and he said that it might have been because she was having a bad night.

Although I expected it to be busy, what with football and everything, the restaurant was surprisingly pretty empty. Despite that, the service was HORRIBLE, nothing compared to my other visits and definitely upset my family and I.  We sat at the bar area and at first our waitress seemed attentive and friendly, but this quickly changed to her being forgetful, rude, and neglectful. She messed up our drink orders twice, ignored our table to chat with and kiss up to (for lack of words) the two tables on either side of us, completely ignoring us and making it so we had to flag her down repeatedly. To make things worse, she argued with us when we asked to have something changed because she didn't tell us everything when we asked her specifics BEFORE ordering it. It was clear we didn't know about it when we asked her specifics, and I found it unprofessional of her to not be clear initially, be argumentative when we told her she didn't tell us, AND to try her best to make it our fault so as to not have to change it. And when she changed it, she STILL messed it up! By then, we had had enough. My boyfriend and I always love to tip (and generously, might I add), but even he was upset when I suggested leaving a tip, flat out pointing out that she had been sucking up for it from everyone else and didn't need it from us. I felt bad, but he was right. I'd suggest going to the cerritos location instead. But if you really have no other choice, just avoid the bar area if you can and opt for the dining area; I've had better service in the dining area from a trainee there, and that's not saying much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=460,3.16,3.12,3.12,2.5960000000000005,3.1360000000000006

With me being extremely indecisive, he had to come around like 3 times before he could take our drink orders.. BUT each time he came by, he was just as courteous and patient as the first time. And he didn't disappear for a long period of time like most servers do. The timing was pretty perfect and I feel it was perfectly well spaced out! It's a kinda creepy-genius-this-guy-is-brilliant kind of thing. Enough time to leave you alone and think, but not too long to make you wonder if he got kidnapped or something (let's be real, here. You're all familiar with servers going MIA while you make your decisions.). Anyway, we seriously got our drinks (a beer and a strawberry mojito that will make you experience true love.) within 2 minutes! On a Saturday night! With a full house! It was fantastic!! Our appeteaser (stuffed mushrooms) was scrumptious! And came out at a decently quick time. Then we decided to also get some boneless wings to devour before ordering some food! They have a nice variety of types of sauces for the wings, and we chose an order of the teriyaki and an order of the garlic Parmesan. My goodness, those wings were delicious!!! The teriyaki had a slight kick of spiciness, yet sweetness, and had a very unique flavor, and the garlic Parmesan ones were really good! By this time we ordered another beer, which AGAIN came to the table in like a minute, and we also finally decided on a pizza.. Half buffalo chicken, and half 5 meat! Everything was so great!! Our food, and especially our drinks, came quickly and finished quickly, haha. David was really REALLY attentive the whole time, but definitely not too constant, making sure we were doing fine and that we had everything we needed. I was seriously blown away by how efficient he was!! When I was offered to have my water refilled it took like 30 seconds for him to come back with some. That rarely happens! I'm used to choking on my food and almost dying before getting my water refilled (at least at other places, but certainly not here tonight!!), and again, I'm sure many of you are familiar with the horrible service most people give. But not here! It was SUPERB and awesome service from David and great food. And that mojito!!!!!! I can't get it out of my head! Fresh muddled strawberries and mint, mmmm mmm mmmmm!!!

This is only the second BJ's I've ever been to, and so far, this is the best one because it is bigger and better lit. A few of us came by after the Long Beach VA Marine Corps Birthday cake cutting ceremony to throw back a couple and continue celebrating the birth of my beloved Corps. We got there, and the young lady told us at the front it'd be about 20-30 minutes and it was probably only about 15. We had leftover birthday cake and asked if they could store it for us and even though it wasn't in a box of its own anymore (it was what was left of the top layer) they were more than willing to store it for us, BUT did tell us that they couldn't be responsible for anything that happened to it since it wasn't covered. We thanked them anyway and decided to keep it with us. It made quite the conversation piece as people walked by our table to admire our ""unique"" cake, which was really, nothing more than an octagon shaped cake with the topper missing and a big ol' dent in the center. Anyway, more people decided to come join us, and we advised the wait staff, and they were more than happy to move us to a bigger area, probably because we still hadn't settled in and ordered anything yet, but I still that thought that was very cool of them. Moving on to the service, I can't complain. ALL the servers were very friendly and outgoing and it felt more like a backyard bullshit session than being in a restaurant. My only complaint of the night was that we had ordered some shots of Patron and a shot of Jack for the non tequila drinker and while the staff was very accommodating in chilling the shots per my compadre's request, when we actually did the shot, which looked like doubles by the way, we found the shots to be watered down, which probably explains why they looked so big. Now, some people might be fooled by this, but a table full of Marines and two Navy corpsmen know when their hooch has been hijacked!!!!! : ) This calls for like a free app or beer or something on our next BJ's visit, BJ's!!!! You guys deserve a do over to correct this discrepancy! HA HA HA..... As far as the food was concerned, no complaints there. Perhaps it was the good company, but it felt like the food came out right away. I ordered some bomb ass carnitas con chile verde fries and honestly, they could give Alberto's a run for his money! The deep dish pizza Doc ordered was good, although it wasn't very deep in the dish. Deep on flavor though. They even reheated it for us when the stragglers finally arrived to the party. Beer wise, I had the Oktoberfest and it was outstanding. Doc's husband got one of their beers closest to a Bud Light and he enjoyed it as well. If I lived closer, I'd probably come here more because of the outstanding service.

Ordered 2 entrees and a side salad. Pick up time was at 6pm but my husband ran an hour late. They were kind enough to give me a courtesy call to ask if I would still pick up my take out order. I assured them I am just that my husband was running a bit late.  So my husband picked up our take out. First thing I asked was for my salad. Apparently it wasn't packed in. Again another disappointment that my take out order wasn't given the entire order. Upset I called the store to asked if its possible to have a refund over the phone for the missing salad because I did not want to have to go back to pick it up. Manager apologize and was kind enough to give me two options. Either get a refund by phone or he can send me a gift card for the amount + a gift. I thought why not I can wait. The salad was well under $4 anyways. Sure enough. I received the gift card in the mail. The manager had written an apology for the mistake and given me a small gift to go along with the refund of the salad. Though I was pleased with the incident. I'm very pleased with the service.

Ok so we sat down and ordered drinks and an appetizer. Everything seemed to be going well, we put in our dinner order and I asked if my ribeye steak could be butterflied to avoid it being burnt. As soon as the food came out, there were two issues, the steak was too charred and it was a New York steak. So the server said I'll get you a ribeye and make sure it's not burned. She offered a soup while I wait. I said sure I'll take one. Let me also add, my parents ordered a burger and it said it had green leaf lettuce. This burger had the nastiest clumps of ""lettuce"" in it, when we brought it to the servers attention she said ""umm ok do you want another burger or what?"" As if there was nothing wrong with the lettuce. My parents just said ""bring us fresh lettuce and we'll eat it."" Lettuce never came. So everyone is pretty much done with their food, when the soup arrives. Didn't look at all appealing. The. She says ""oh your steak should be right out."" Steak came out and it was charred on the outside and very undercooked inside.

80,Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",909,913,3414.0,4.0,2015-04-02,"I don't often write about big chain restaurants, but when I do, only because I have to recognize them for their service. This is a special one. With my girlfriend and I having a busy day in SoCal, we decided to eat at a general restaurant. We didn't want anything fancy, but something safe. With a good track record, we dined in at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Downey. Located at the north segment of the StoneWood Mall near the Food Court, you'll find BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. I always loved the name BJ's. More particularly because of a TV series called, ""M*A*S*H*. There is plenty of parking at BJ's/StoneWood Mall. Unless its Christmas Season, then worry just a little. We walked up to the entrance of BJ's and I saw two doors. One regular swinging door, but I saw a REVOLVING door. OK, when I come to LAX or when I am ever in New York, I will always want to go in & swing around. Once we walked into BJ's, I noticed how huge it was. Tall ceilings & huge dining areas. They were even hosting a little party in the patio area.  We checked in & requested a booth seating. The staff gladly found one for us. I love that they did find a booth, but it was one of those for like six plus people. More room for us to feel comfortable. Our host for the evening was Melinda. We started off with drinks. My gf ordered Lemonade ($2.75) and I ordered a Club Soda ($2.95) with a glass of water with lemon. Not sure why Club Soda is a little more expensive than regular soda. I didn't even have a hangover since I don't drink. I should have just ordered a Sprite. When Melinda asked us if we were ready, my gf answered before she finished her question. Let's say that we were very hungry after our busy adventure through SoCal. She wanted to start with an appetizer. She ordered the Flat Bread Margherita Pizza ($9.50) with no tomatoes. We would order our main meal a few minutes later. I know my gf loves this flat bread very much. After inputting the appetizer in, Melinda gave us a few minutes to look over the main course. My gf and I were discussing what she should order. I had my eyes set on a salad. She had two options for herself. It was either the BBQ Chicken Pizza or the  Shrimp Scampi Pasta. I told her to order the Shrimp Scampi Pasta because we had the flat bread. When Melinda came back, we started our order. I had no questions about my order. I ordered the Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad ($12.95) with a separate side of Honey Mustard dressing. My gf asked Melinda about her preference, but ultimately my gf went towards the Shrimp Scampi Pasta ($16.50). Once we placed our order, the flat bread came. Great timing for two hungry people. Just think of it as a small version of a pizza. Love the cheese & the small thin crust. Don't forget to add the Parmesan cheese. I had finished half of my Club Soda and Melinda was already on top of it by getting me another glass. About 10-15 minutes later, our food arrived. Like many other Yelpers, we took pictures of our food. My salad was delicious with the mix greens with the onion rings with the barbecue sauce. Also, I loved how every time I munched into the salad, there was one ingredient felt like I was eating an apple. I am not sure if it was the lettuce or an ingredient I am not familiar with. Dipped both the onion rings & chicken slices with the honey mustard, it made the meal more spectacular. As for my gf's dish, she tried the Shrimp Scampi Pasta and was already feeling nauseated with it. She had me sample it and the taste was very bland and dry. According to the menu, its supposed to be ""Flavorful shrimp tossed with delicate angel hair pasta in a light blend of olive oil"". The pasta felt like the oil was never there and the pasta felt like it was poorly cooked. She couldn't deal with it and flagged down Melinda. My gf told her that this dish was just not right at all. I had to agree with her. So, my gf wanted to have her dish switched with one of her two choices. It was the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($15.25). The male supervisor or the Shift Manager came by our table with a sincere apology & would get the order taken care of. The Shift Manager came back & personally delivered the Deep Dish BBQ Chicken Pizza. He apologized for the food preparation. The final test: My gf's enjoyment. I didn't get to try this out, but my gf loved it. We were back to high spirits with the dish. Although her food was not originally done right the first time, it was making sure the customer was taken care of. When it was time to check out, we saw that Shift Manager took off the order for the Shrimp Scampi & comp'd the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Now, this changes everything for my reviews. I don't write reviews for big places, but service like this requires recognition. In a perfect world, things should be done  with one shot. However, we live in a realistic world. We learn from our mistakes & we make the situation even better. Thank you BJ's! Yelp...I Live, Breathe, and Share my Reviews for everyone to read.

I don't think it was worth $7.75.  During a weekday lunch rush they didn't have anyone at the take out counter yet they had 3 hostesses at the hostess/seating counter. I had to wait for one of the busy servers to notice me and give me my order. How to fix the problem? Train one of the 3 hostesses kickin it at the hostess counter to also do take out orders and that would take a load off of the servers. This wasn't the first time I've had timing issues with this BJ's location. They're either understaffed or being managed by time insensitive managers.

This BJ's has been here for 2+ years so I don't know why they haven't worked through their system of doing things.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=60,2.72,3.0,3.12,2.44,2.8880000000000003

536,April Y.,"Buena Park, CA",260,532,254.0,1.0,2015-05-03,"I've been to numerous BJ's, and this is by far, the worst one.  My family and I get here on a pretty busy night- NFL Draft and, Ducks playoffs, and Clippers/Spurs Game 6. We were expecting to catch the various games on TV while we were there. Upon entering, we noticed there was only ONE screen in the bar and just a few TVs around the restaurant. The one screen showed 4 different channels, but the NFL draft was shown larger than the other 3 channels. The smaller screens were barely visible from the bar, so we requested our server to change the setting to make it all the same size. Once the screen sizes changed, it was so much better. However, due to the higher bar tables, it was so hard to see the games because of the heads blocking our vision. This location really needs to add more TVs throughout. It's a pretty small location, but there should be at least two more TVs in the bar. What is a disappointment.  On top of that, our server at the bar was awful. He barely came around to check up and did not smile once. However, we ended up with another server when our original server went on break. This new server was awesome (1 star for his service and kindness). It was a drastic difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=60,2.68,2.93,3.104,2.5320000000000005,2.83
414,Kirstie M.,"Downey, CA",7,12,2.0,1.0,2015-05-06,"The worst customer service experience I've had with a restaurant ever. My boyfriend and I came to the location about 1045p and waited about 15mins for a table which was not a problem to us at all. We were seated and our first round of drinks came quickly. Our server did not come to the table for about 15 mins before he took our order which again was not an issue. Our server came back 10mins later and said he lost his checkbook that had our orders in it and needed to take them again. At this point we were a bit frustrated with the timing of everything. It had been about 30mins in and no food and our drinks were empty. I ordered a salad and requested that it come prior to our food. 45 mins had passed and our server was no where in sight. The restaurant was not crowded and there seemed to be a good ratio of servers to tables. The server finally came back after 20mins and said he was so sorry about the wait and that he would check on the food. He asked if we needed refills when he saw our empty cups. He came back with refills like 5mins later and said nothing to us. A table of four that was sitting across from us that was seated about 15mins after my boyfriend and I received their food first and one of the plates was exactly what my boyfriend ordered.  at that point we had been waiting for almost 1hr 30mins for our food. We were very hungry and did not receive the best customer service. I am fully aware that BJs is not a fine dining restaurant but, the expectations is that a customer can at least receive their food in a timely manner. I ended up stopping the server and telling him that we are just going to pay for the drinks and leave. There were three servers in the front just laughing and talking to each other while a few tables were patiently waiting for their plates. The server came by maybe three times max. To make matters worst the server was like I talked to my manger you don't have to pay for your drinks and did not show face. I myself am a manager and work in an elevated customer service environment and I make sure that when there is a situation that I personally rectify the situation and ask the customer if there is anything further we can do. The manager never came by or wanted to speak to us. My assumption is he was the only older guy wearing a blue collared shirt that was hanging out in the front of the restaurant talking to the hostess. It was by far the worst experience I've had at a BJs. We ended up walking down to Buffalo Wild Wings and had a great experience there! Needless to say I am very disappointed with the locations along with the customer service aspect of it and don't think I will return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=420,2.52,2.9,3.092,2.6600000000000006,2.748

244,Patrizia R.,"Temple City, CA",86,52,259.0,1.0,2015-05-16,"I would give this location no stars if I could. Let me tell you our HORRIBLE (10X) experience in this particular BJ's. The first time BJ's was a disappoint considering I've/we've always been a fan/s. I believe this is a long overdue review since this nightmare happened last Mother's Day, May 10th. I wouldn't want to think that Mother's Day happens to be a very busy day or that weekend per se has been very busy which explains why the service & everything about it was poor (not even mediocre). That should never be an excuse for any establishment after all. The negativity of this visit was just one after another. It's like being shot with a series of bullets until you end up being completely dead since the situation never got better & they weren't able to alleviate the situation either. So here it goes: - We're a group of 6 & 4 of my friends have already placed their orders except for me & my husband. Server took them all & told her that ours will be to follow as I do not intend to eat anyway. Just deciding on what to drink. - Server came back a few mins later & my hubby placed his order too. Told her I still needed time since mine was just a drink & she could proceed with the rest of the group's meals. She asked too if she could go on & have everything ready for the rest of them & the response was clear as sky, ""Yes go on & have them ready"". - Server came back with my hubby's meal (which btw was placed at a later time than the rest of the group) & took/noted the drink I've decided to have. - Server came back with my drink but still without everyone's plates. - Hubby was almost finished with his meal when the rest of the food came (40mins tops).  - My friend who was extremely hungry by then b/c of the tremendous amount of wait time, received his order of Shrimp Alfredo WITHOUT SHRIMP or anything on it for that matter, just the white sauce. - Extremely disappointed b/c of this my friend called the server & told her about the plate w/o anything on it considering they had to wait for THAT long. My friend continued with her tirade mentioning that she doesn't understand why me & my hubby got ours first when we placed ours way later than theirs - To make matters worse, the server who obviously wasn't trained to provide favorable customer service, argued that the reason for the delay was because we (my hubby & I) took so much time to decide on what to eat or drink - (she was pointing at us) - Was too tired & defeated to react & tell her that she was told to proceed with everyone else's meals earlier on - She should realize herself that the proper way of dealing with customers is NEVER to blame them for their establishment's inefficiency anyway - All of us were on the same page. Too tired to care or bother. We weren't the irate customers who would've lambasted the catty server - Dinner went on peacefully & nobody talked about the failed shrimp alfredo until my other friend found a TOOTHPICK in her salad! Luckily she wasn't like me who normally doesn't look at what she's eating & would continue on poking leaves & ingesting it in her system. (I wish I took a picture but we were so defeated, disgusted, dumbfounded by what we saw & didn't realize the picture could've been handy for Yelp) - Luckily she took her time to eat & looked through what goes on in her plate. Otherwise she could've ingested a sharp toothpick (used? hope not) & God knows what's going to happen in her stomach  - We called the manager to complain. Told them about the series of letdowns. He apologized & told us that he sort of knew about the situation b/c the server told him that she felt that the whole dining experience already started off on the wrong foot. (Of course we were all like? What kind of an excuse was that?) - My friend no longer needs to pay for the disgusting salad she had but her nightmare didn't end there. She took my glass of water earlier & just when she's about to consume all of it, she found a dead bug floating in it!! DISGUSTING on so many levels! I was lucky she wanted my glass as I would've ended up drinking the entire thing w/o realizing there was a bug in it!  - We called up the manager UHHGEN.. & this time, we told him that none of us are going to pay for this dinnernightmare we just went through. He apologized & said he'll see what he can do. When he came back, we only paid for the alcoholic beverages my hubby & I had. - I wasn't happy that we still had to pay for something. I honestly feel that their establishment did not deserve a single dime from us. I thought if we complained about terrible customer service b/c the server BLAMED our drinks for the delay of the other meals, then our whole bill will be entirely free!  - And to add more insult to injury (while everyone in our group is still in the heat of the moment) our server came back acting as if nothing happened (no apology whatsoever), asked us if we WANTED BOXES! We were like what?! Box for the salad with a toothpick in it? Are you serious?!

Let me start by saying we arrived there around lunch time walked straight to the bar and sat ourselves down. We were approached after a couple of minutes by a server and were asked if we were ready to order and we were so we did, that was the end of our good experience. I ordered the soup and salad, I had requested extra cilantro and avocado on my soup and neither happened when it arrived I asked my server that I had ordered extra cilantro etc. and she's basically arguing with me that I already have extra on my soup needless to say I told her to bring me more..she did finally. My kid ordered the kids Alfredo/broccoli pasta and it had a big hair implanted on the dish next to the pasta I called over the manager and he agreed to make another one  which but at which point I was already done with my meal. They had the audacity to charge for my kids meal in spite of the huge inconvenience. What I failed to mention was the fact that it was my sons birthday and with all the time wasted we had no time for his pizzokie which he was looking forward to.

We were seated in the rear of the bar  10 minutes later, that area was full of other customers. Second, one fork was filthy, it was replaced by a second filthy fork. These dirty forks were replaced by plastic utensils. Then the server took a long time to bring crackers, which should be readily available and not take over 10 minutes to get. Then, the manager comps a dessert; which had a hair in it! The manager offers a coupon for the same dessert which had a hair in it!

332,Vanessa S.,"Riverside County, CA",0,9,1.0,1.0,2015-08-23,"Ok so let me start off by saying I've been to multiple locations of bjs and I've never had an issue, until this past weekend at the Downey location. I went on a Friday night at around 9:30, my boyfriend got us a booth at the bar section and the waitress seemed very nice, a few minutes later she came to tell us she was done for the night and a waitress who's name starts with a ""D"" was gonna serve us for the remainder of the night, ok fair enough. She asked if we were ready to order and we said we needed a few more minutes. She didn't return for about 20 minutes if not longer. She hardly even made eye contact with us so we couldn't wave her over. Once we made eye contact with her we waved and she took our order. When the food came, they didn't give us utensil or napkins so we waited about another 15 min for the napkins and utensils. We really felt like she was purposely avoiding us. We thought maybe it was because it was only the 2 of us at a booth and that annoyed her, I really don't know. That night we were there from 9:30 to 12 am, we would have left earlier but an hour if not more was spent by us waiting to get service. In the time we were there the waitress only stopped by our booth 4 times, all 4 times because we had to wave her over. This girl made it so difficult just to get a beer. She would walk past our booth and wouldn't make eye contact with us or asked if we were doing alright. I've never experienced this at any other bjs. We weren't rude or obnoxious, we sat quietly at the booth so I still can't figure out why she would be avoiding our booth. And no, it wasn't overly busy that night, it was a regular Friday night type of crowd and we noticed everyone else at her section was getting served. I'm very disappointed especially since I love the bjs franchise.

It had corn and beans which gave it a great taste perfect for the summer. Just is. Our appetizers were good. Calamari was fresh and it was not chewy. Now comes the bad part. I would have given this place 4 stars, but the hostesses sucked!

ANYWAY this time I wanted the food but not the mediocre service so I ordered online for pick up....BIG MISTAKE....upon arriving at the mall I was unable to find parking ANYWHERE the 4 spots designated for BJs takeout were taken after I circled for a half an hour I called the restaurant to see if I could just stop by the designated spots and if someone could come out (since I saw online you also offered curbside service) I had the exact payment in cash...I was told no, that I could stop directly in front of BJs and BLOCK heavy mall traffic and run inside I explained that I would not feel ok with doing that to the public! What kind of person does that. I digress. Anyway she put me on hold for several minutes and then told me I could go to an alley behind BJs and park there. I didn't feel comfortable with that either but it was a better option then blocking everyone! Luckily on the way over there some of your takeout spots opened. Unfortunately the bad experience did not stop there, one of my hamburger buns was literally drenched in VINEGAR so gross, and the mustard and mayo I requested was not on the burger so I ate it with one bun and no condiments and the Brocc Cheddar soup bowl I ordered was more of a cup.

We were all hungry.  We placed our order then,, it took a long time to start to see any food, first the soups and salads together. Would have been nice to get the salad before the soup while we waited.  Then 5 min later one kids meal comes out nuggets with fries, then 10 min later fries but no Mac and cheese, then 5 min later baked potato and chicken Alfredo no Mac, some more time goes by pizza comes out.  Poor kids were starving and they had to wait till the end when the spaghetti and meat balls and baked potato comes out.. No drink refills we didn't even see our server.. For a long time.. So the people with soup and salad were not able to enjoy their meal with us because they got their meal first and the server was not around to get them seconds.

We arrived and walked into a small section specifically dedicated for take-out and only take-out. I guess we weren't paying much attention when we walked in and missed the fact that there are two entrances and both entrances are for two  different things. The man behind the counter cleared our confusion and led us to the hostess. We totally felt like dorks.  Our nice hostess asked if we were okay with sitting in one of the booths to which to we replied with a yes. I really liked that she asked us first instead of just sitting us anywhere. Im pretty sure this was mostly due to the fact that it was a slow day and most tables were unoccupied anyway.  Our waiter took no time to head towards our booth. He was attentive the entire time and kept the refills coming. To start off we ordered the avocado egg rolls appetizer. The egg rolls were all right. I wasn't too fond of the overly mushy texture but my tastebuds enjoyed the flavor; the tangy sauce was amazing too. For our entrees I ordered the Hickory Smoked Brisket and Bacon Burger while my boyfriend tried their new Baked Deep Dish Ziti. My meal was merely okay. It was full of flavor but there was not much of a wow factor to it. My boyfriends Deep Dish Ziti on the other hand was phenomenal. I kept sticking my fork into his plate (sorry not sorry). Half way through our meal our waiter informed us that he was leaving and that another waitress would be taking over. The waitress was just as attentive as he was. Awesome customer service.  Our appetizer and entrees took quite some time to come out. Hunger doesn't know patience and neither do I. I didn't understand why our food was taking so long since it wasn't very busy that day.

Our order was simple...queso dip and chips, two coffees and the Pizookie trio: peanut butter, salted caramel and monkey bread. The queso dip made it to our table along with our two coffees that were accompanied by four cute little creamers. (Four creamers for two coffees...really? ) As for the Pizookie trio...at least they got one out of three correct, and my impression was that it's a common mistake because the waitress knew which flavors they mistakenly included. Maybe Bj's name comes from the fact that their service blows. I can't even imagine how terrible the service must be during their busy hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=340,2.32,2.77,2.948,3.0760000000000005,2.59
235,Sarina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,101,48.0,3.0,2016-03-16,Ate here about two weeks ago. Food is always great and my husband and I visit different locations all over Southern California. Our server was very friendly and gave great service. There were a few things that happened out of her control. We ordered appetizer and entrees and he ordered a cocktail. The drink came really late like literally 30 seconds before the food. The food showed up and we didn't have the calamari delivered yet. He ordered ribs and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The calamari came after the food. Our server offered to take the appetizer back and off the check if we were unhappy that it didn't come first. We told her it was ok. I was not looking but my husband took a bite of calamari and a black long hair had been breaded inside and he pulled it out. We called our server and she immediately apologized and even offered to buy us dessert from her own money. We declined because the restaurant should do that. Not her. It was absolutely disgusting. One of the managers (seemed like from the kitchen) came out to our table and apologized and they took the calamari off the check. However we had left some of our asparagus side from the ribs on the plate so that got thrown away (we were sharing). The ribs however were tender and juicy and my spaghetti meatballs were a nice portion. It was enjoyable because I was with my husband and the rest of the food was great but we didn't really think it was handled properly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey?start=300,2.24,2.73,2.948,3.5,2.5340000000000003

Bad mistake. Paint nite has about 20 people there and two waiters to service all the people. I understand that the poor waiters are overwhelmed but as soon as we got their we asked for the happy hour specials, the waitress mumbled through them and I didn't want to be rude so I asked her to repeat them. My other friend couldn't understand her at all so then she asked a question about a special, the waitress Danielle asked us ""are you going to listen now?"" Ugh yes we are. Whatever she never smiled and then a nice make waiter was switched with her. Enough not to tip her but it only got worse. We got our drinks and food almost at the end of the paint session, many mix ups with our food but the worst was when another friend asked for a spoon like 3 times, never got it so she stood up and went searching for one, a random waiter Andrew Ponce goes up to her and tells her ""here is your fucking spoon."" How rude! Food was delicious and my beer was nice and cold but the service was horrible. I worked in customer service for years so I really expect good or decent customer service.

We didn't. After our server took our order, we got our drinks, and patiently waited.....while others nearby, who arrived after us received their food. I wish I would've timed it, but I'll say about 45 minutes before we finally flagged down our waitress (who seemed to be avoiding eye contact with us). She just said, ""your food's taking long, huh?""

I think I have come here more just to drink than I have to order food. The bartenders are super funny and are ready to serve you up another drink as soon as you are looking empty. I enjoy it when my bartenders give suggestions or tips on what to try or how to get the most out of your money. One of the bartenders asked if we wanted to try mixing beers and I thought to myself well that doesn't sound good. But whatever we went for it and it was pretty good, I can't remember what it was of course but it was a mix of two of their brews all the workers knew about it so it must have been an insider things. Also, we were a couple beers in when the bartender mentioned to us that it would be a little cheaper if we were to order a pitcher which would give us about 3 and and half beers and that way we could just go and chill for a bit. So we tried that, I appreciated that tip. I think we were really into trying a couple different brews though so we just stuck to ordered our beers separately.

It is so mouthwatering and delicious. The bread is so plump and fluffy. My favorite flavor is the BBQ chicken. I also love getting the pastas here, the garlic bread that comes with the pasta is delicious as well. If you want to try an appetizer I suggest the avocado egg rolls. For the beer, I tried the tatonka stout (8.5% alch) and it was great.  For dessert try the pizookies! They have multiple flavors and seem to have a new flavor on the menu every so often. The pizookie is a freshly baked hot cookie with icecream on top. It is the perfect combo. The cookie smells so fresh and every bite is amazing.  If you come with a big party there may be a long wait, so I suggest calling ahead and making reservations. Also, if you come here often you should sign up for the BJs rewards program.

The apps were all right, the best being the ahi poke. It came with crispy chips to contrast the soft tuna. My experience overall was disappointing. Everyone in my party received their entree, and they brought me a top sirloin instead of the ribeye I ordered. By the time my ribeye came out most of my group was done eating, while I had just begun to eat. It really put a damper on the whole vibe. Unfortunately, that wasn't the worst part; the ribeye was awful. It must have been select or canner grade. It was tough, chewy, and low quality. I didn't expect a Mastro's quality steak, but c'mon, I can make a steak at home much better than that for $24. BJ's claims to age their steaks 28 days. I can guarantee this steak was no where near that level. Fortunately I had a tomato soup before the ribeye. It was all right, very tomatoey, and not too creamy. The beignet dessert tasted stale. It's like they served us an old one that had been made hours before and sat around.

Our original server (whose name we never got; he was a long-bearded guy with plugs in his ears) took a while to get to our table to get drinks. When he did take our drink orders, he took our food orders as well since we wanted to do some appetizers. We ordered 2 waters, an order of Buffalo wings, and a mini deep dish pepperoni pizza. Almost 15 minutes pass by, and no sign of our drinks. We couldn't really find our server anyways, and when we did see him, he would be talking to people (friends) that he clearly knew at the bar (he gave one of them a hug). Mind you, our server never asked if we wanted our wings drizzled or with the sauces in the side (every BJs I've ever been to, they've asked, except for last night). He never brought napkins or plates either for our food.  Our food came out moments later, and we had to ask the lady who brought it out about our drinks. She apologized and then Adrian (another server in the bar area) brought waters out for us.  We also bothered him for some extra ranch, napkins, peppers for the pizza, etc.  We felt bad, but we felt that our server was nonexistent and needed better service. Adrian quickly brought out our needed items and asked if we needed anything else. Eventually we saw him again, and flagged him down for a pitcher of beer. At this point, my friend and I asked Adrian if he could just take care of us instead since our other server was never around (again, could see him talking to one of his buddies). We explained to him that we would prefer him over the other dude since he wasn't taking great care of us and providing the proper service. Without a doubt, he made sure that he could take care of us, and did an amazing job.  He was always on it for the rest of our dining experience, and was super friendly. At the end of the night, he handed us our bill and told us that he took off/discounted some items from our bill due to the inconvenience and unfortunate service. He apologized and said that it definitely wasn't BJs' standards and he felt bad. Overall, Adrian was just super great and we were glad to have the pleasure of him serving us in replacement of the other guy. I don't know if it was maybe because we are two young adults who he (our first server) may have just assumed we weren't going to tip well, or maybe he wasn't a good server...... not sure, but jokes on him because we tipped Adrian over 20%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-downey,3.6,3.73,3.32,2.9240000000000004,3.6780000000000004

My boyfriend asks the waiter who dropped off the eggrolls (who is not our waiter) if we could please get some plates. He literally did not stop walking from the moment he saw my boyfriend talking to him. He didn't even turn to look at him. He heard my boyfriend ask for the plates and kept on walking. We looked at each other puzzled and he said ""Did that guy just ignore me right now?"" I saw him just look over and keep on walking. I was furious. Our regular waiter comes with the plates and I ask him who was the waiter that dropped off our eggrolls. He says his name is Steven. I told him what happened and that we were very upset. The manager comes over a few moments later and says he heard we had an issue. We explain what happened and he was very apologetic about it. Our food arrives and the girl who brought out our food brings us the wrong pizza. First, she looked completely lost not knowing which table to go to. I suspected that would be our food and when she gets there it's the wrong kind of pizza. Our waiter comes and apologizes saying she made a mistake and that the correct pizza was right there the whole time. We were almost done with our food and a family comes to sit at the table behind us. They ask that waiter Steven something and again this asshole just walks by without responding to them. The lady turns to her husband and says ""Did you see the way that waiter acted?"" By now we're already getting our bill and about to leave. The manager was kind enough to comp our appetizer for the inconvenience. This review gets 2 stars because our waiter whose name I did not get was great and the manager was very nice. However, that dick Steven should not be working there as he has to deal with the public and he is obviously not fit for the job.

The root beer glazed rib appetizer is delicious but the regular sauce they put on their racks of ribs can be kind of spicy. The rib-eye steak is great. We order it medium rare and it is seasoned well and cooked as we like it. Their wedge salad, which is an old fashioned favorite that they do right, is great with plenty of blue cheese and bacon etc on top. We're beer drinkers and usually get their hefenweizer (i'm sure my spelling is off) but this last visit i gave my liver a break and tried the iced tea, it was okay...just iced tea...i missed the hef, it's a great beer. They have weekday deals and their $10 burgers are creative and filling. I like the fries; they seem to have changed over the years and now they look like they have a crunchy coating on them but are very soft and potatoey inside. We usually go on off hours and sit in the bar section and can say this location has attentive, informed, cheerful servers who never fail to enhance our meal.

I asked her to take it out of our check and she had an attitude about. Her response was well it's being made if you don't want to wait for it someone else can take it. What type of customer service is that???? So instead of taking it out the check she gave me a coupon for a dessert next time and said it will be out.

My granddaughter was too hungry to wait so she ate hers which was the less burnt of the three. Our waitress didn't bring out the steaks and promptly took the steaks back. Needless to say I'm very disappointed. The wait was just too long for my taste. Paying over $100 for a party of 5 with no alcohol, you should at least enjoy your meal.

I went to lunch today as I often do and sat at the bar so as not to take up a table for two or four. After a reasonable wait, maybe 5 minutes I was acknowledged and my order was taken.  There were 5 people at the bar area in an area that seats roughly 15 people. There were three very lovely ladies sitting to my left  who where taking up a staff of three people. Great service. For them.  So I wait for my small pizza. (My $16 small pizza) 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes. After 30 minutes I signal my bartender (who  was busy doing bartender stuff with the ladies) I had not heard from him since he set my place setting 1/2 hour prior.  I inquired as to the status  of my $16 small pizza.  Here is the thing. I realize the kitchen gets backed up.  I get it. I am in retail for God's sake. Things happen.

Icing on the Pizza? I ate one quarter of the pizza and inquired about the check. Oh my credit card was charged in record time. But  I was not offered a ""to go"" container for the 3/4 of my remaining pizza. Maybe there is a minimum charge before BJ's offers you a ""to go"" container? There is a reason the word  ""Service"" is used in the Food Service Industry.  I spent a great deal of money over the years entertaining clients at BJ's at the Stonewood center.

I was waiting in line to pick up my order but the cashier was on the phone for over 10 minutes and the other woman next to her simply said ""we will be right with you."" Thankfully a nice man jumped in and started to pack my order and help check my order out. I ordered a 2 flavor pizookie which was sad looking and after my 15 minute wait in their lobby and 2 minute drive back to work, my ice cream was melted.  My chicken tortilla soup should be called Tortilla Soup as there was 2 tiny pieces of chicken in it.  My ranch dipping sauce is unbelievably salty ... how do you get ranch wrong?

20,Rayshawn W.,"Paramount, CA",823,560,2240.0,4.0,2017-11-09,"It's that time of year again where Pumpkin Spice reigns supreme and BJ's has jumped on the bandwagon.  This is my preferred location and still remains to be so. I've never had bad service here. I stopped in to catch a Dodgers game and to grab a couple of appetizers. Fried calamari and stuffed mushrooms are my go to but instead of calamari I went ahead and tried two flavors of wings I haven't prior. The Nashville Hot and Exxxxtra Hot Buffalo are decent but the original hot & spicy buffalo still remains my favorite of the sauces.  On to the Pumpkin Spice aka Spiced Pumpkin. BJ's has conjured up one crazy mix of a drink with Rumchata, Mount Gay Black Barrel Rum, BJ's Pumpkin Ale, and pumpkin puree. A bold mix like that deserved a try from myself. The result is a taste that's as crazy as it sounds lol. I couldn't pin point an individual flavor in taste except for the pumpkin. All others served to give an odd but somewhat strong flavor. Enough of it would probably knock you on your back haha.  The Dodgers took a loss that night but hey, the food and service was good as always. Just another chill night at the BJ's Downey location.

Today, I went to order take out and wanted to use my rewards points for $25 off. When I requested this, the cashier named GLORIA M asked me if she can see an email or proof showing that I had the points to be eligible for the discount. (I wasn't mad yet) But, BJs has the entire thing on their computer system and I never had been asked to look for an email or code online. They literally print out the total points FOR YOU. She insisted that I needed a code and made me look for my email and online account to show her proof I had the eligibility. During the entire thing, she kept giving me attitude and was being rude giving me looks and all. This was frustrating because after several minutes of trying and failing to find proof I had enough points, she just went to the manager and asked for help. The manager showed her how to redeem on the screen and EASY and DONE. What should've taken a minute to order took 10 minutes. Even till the end, she was like ""next time, you still need to show us the code to redeem your points""...there is NO code. It's not even over here... Once I got my food, I wasn't even surprised to see that I got chicken instead of the shrimp I ordered. When I took it to the counter, she insisted I ordered chicken. She faulted me when she got the order wrong....why did I have to be the one to blame for the wrong order? I had to wait another 15 minutes so that I could leave with my correct order.  Yes, not even funny but it's not over yet... She was also discriminating customers? While I was waiting for her second try at my order, I noticed that she offered other customers water while they wait...but she never offered or asked me neither the first or second time.  When my correct order came out, she didn't even bag my food for me. She just placed it on the counter after announcing that my order was out and I had to bag it myself. What place makes you bag your own food order, whether or not you use the same bag...?  Thank you Gloria M! Thanks to you I was able to stay at BJs for 40 minutes to delay my family dinner so that I can feed them with half cold and half warm food!  I've never ever felt so angry with customer service here or at ANY BJs ever. But this was just the worst...
