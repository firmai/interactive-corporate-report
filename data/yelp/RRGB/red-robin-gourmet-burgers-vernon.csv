Gary F.,"Calgary, Canada",0,3,,5.0,8/2/2017,We had a group of 5 stop in for dinner on a Monday night around 7 and things seemed a little chaotic at first. There seemed to be lots of large groups and other tables were left empty and unset. However we were seated quickly and had our drink orders taken in a timely manner. Things just got better from there. Our server Nikki was funny and attentive and made us all comfortable. Nikki was honestly one of the best waitresses I've ever had and she seemed to really enjoy her job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vernon
Malaiya K.,"Vernon, Canada",0,2,,1.0,10/16/2017,I hated this place it was disgusting loud and so many people were obnoxious!  The bathroom  Was a complete disaster while I was there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vernon
Ashley B.,"Calgary, Canada",0,17,14,3.0,4/22/2017,"Service was prompt, food was good. I had the whiskey river bbq chicken wrap with yam fries, coworker had a bacon cheddar burger with fries and a milkshake and we both enjoyed our meals. I love the freckled lemonade at RR and it's bottomless! The staff were friendly and receptive toward my coworker who thinks he is funny but comes off weird. I normally love the leaning tower if onion rings but I was too full this time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vernon
Joyce M.,"Claresholm, Canada",0,26,,4.0,10/19/2016,"Delicious lettuce wrapped burger, and it seemed quite popular. Enjoyed trying a new cocktail too, and was surprised to be asked if I liked it. Choice do dips for the perfectly-seasoned steak fries was a nice change. Just a bit pricey for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vernon
Runny Y.,"Vernon, Canada",0,21,,4.0,8/27/2016,"Again a great late lunch at RR... Had a (semi) relaxing time with my children - enjoyed some Cheese Sticks (Yum!) and the boys had good lunches (A Loaded Kid Burger - and Mac and Cheese both with fries)... Unfortunately (I should know not to order outside my box!) My Bonsia Burger was Death Charred - both the pineapple and patty (Black - I even got my older boy to test it - he even said ""Yuck""). They did offer to remake it - but by the time they came to check I had eaten 1/4 and most of my fries....plus the Boys were almost done thier meals....and we had to go for our schedule. So the waitress was wonderful and had the burger taken off the bill. That was very kind of her as we couldn't stay to have another burger made (even though I bet it would have been great!) Disappointing because our burgers are usually so good :( Our service here is always so great. Especially with my ""interesting"" child - I always appreciate the care and service we receive :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vernon
D H.,"Okotoks, Canada",0,58,2,3.0,8/11/2016,"Atmosphere is good, location is good, decor is good, staff were fast and courteous. Burgers didn't taste or look anything other than basic store bought frozen patties, I wouldn't describe them as gourmet that's for sure. It was a decent enough meal, but for what you get, the price was high. I certainly didn't dislike the experience by any means, but I wouldn't be in a rush to search it out. If it wasn't claiming to be a specialist burger joint, offering gourmet burgers I probably wouldn't be a little deflated by the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vernon
Matthew M.,"Calgary, Canada",0,3,,4.0,7/30/2014,The  food is good but half the things from there website aren't at the restaurant. But the food is good and I guess that is all that maters.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vernon
