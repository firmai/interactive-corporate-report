Diana R.,"Orlando, FL",13,13,4,4.0,11/20/2013,"Consistent food and service!  Great place to have lunch while your at the mall.     Today I had one of their small plate meals, a flat bread.  I had the Bianco with Kendal Jackson Chardonnay, and they paired beautifully.  I would defiantly get this pairing again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Jonathan R.,"Orlando, FL",0,40,32,4.0,8/17/2014,"The BBQ salad was a refreshing higher scale choice for dinner. I also had the Tortilla spring rolls which I found to be a tad bit cooler on the temperature then I would have preferred. Love, my server, was on top of my experience and never let me get low on my ice tea. Overall, this is a better choice then the food court, especially during peak times at the Florida Mall. The 4 star review is based on other mall choices as most food court food cannot compare to the quality found here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Sumi G.,"Orlando, FL",85,33,,3.0,9/20/2013,"I usually avoid chains but CPK is one of the ones I like to go to every now and then, especially when I go shopping. The food is decent but the service is SO slow! I've been to this CPK twice and my apps have come out 20 mins later with the pizzas.  Don't come here hungry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Charles O.,"New York, NY",14,59,1,1.0,4/22/2014,"Dismal experience.  Slow, indifferent service, nasty food.  We have been to many California Pizza Kitchens, and have always found the atmosphere to be friendly, and the food to be tasty.  Not here.  We waited a long time (45 minutes?) for two pizzas.  One was cold, with raw mushrooms on top - not at all like the menu promised; the other was hot, but not cooked all the way through.  Avoid, unless you want an expensive, depressing dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
David H.,"Titusville, FL",13,18,16,5.0,8/3/2013,"My wife has been a fan of CPK frozen pizza for quite awhile  and did not know that it was a resturant as well. We found it tucked in a corner of the Florida Mall.  It was nice an modern inside, friendly staff, you can see them tossing pizza dough; our food arrived in good time and hot. Our starter was a spinach artichoke dip, which was warm, creamy and awesome. I had the fish taco's, my wife had roasted garlic chicken pizza and our daughter had the four cheese Ravioli; all of our food was outstanding, from the truly hand tossed pizza, perfectly cooked fish and the perfectly cooked Ravioli in its wonderful sauce.  Our waitress was Ashley and she was attentive, pleasant, friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Tony M.,"Boca Raton, FL",265,26,,4.0,9/3/2013,"First of all let's be clear, this is not the capital grille ... we all know that, so the rating is for that of a semi fast food type of restaurant.  W started off with the rolls and olive oil and they were okay. The service was very good.  We enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere and enough space for the kids to make a little noise playing with their new ""Despicable Me Minions: Kevin, Carl, and Steve...   the boys had a cheese pizza, my wife made her own cheese-less with veggies and I had the new garlic chicken pizza with caramelized onions and golden scallions off the chain for pizza!  The only disappointment was the margarita my wife and I split-way too much sour mix.  The night before we had the ""perfect margarita"" at Margaretville; which is hard to top, but that's a whole other review!  Oh, try the butter cake with vanilla ice-cream YUM!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Janene H.,"Apopka, FL",771,1351,2078,4.0,11/23/2008,"Solidly good food, especially for a mall! We wanted a place at the mall where we could get away, sit down and relax. The food is really good, we split the egg rolls, BBQ chicken salad and shrimp scampi pizza all of which were delicious. The salad is a favorite of mine, it has a great combination of flavors and textures between the BBQ of the chicken, corn and crunchy tortilla strips. Even if your not a salad person (I am not) you'll like this one.  The restaurant is tucked away by Bucca and Nordstrom and is somewhat cramped. Once our server came she was very quick which we were grateful for since we were eating with a toddler! BTW, even our picky toddler loved the eggrolls and his baby pizza!  Not a high class joint but a MUCH better choice than the food court! Oh, and at 2pm on a Saturday we had no trouble getting a table. The mall was crowded with people in for The Classic (BCU vs. FAMU) but I guess not many people venture to that part of the mall! It was a nice escape.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Dina N.,"Orlando, FL",480,155,93,3.0,3/15/2011,"I love CPK. They have a great variety of pizzas as well as salads and other dishes. All of their soups I have had, Sedona Tortilla and Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley, have been yummy as well. They started offering ""small cravings"" which are little appetizers. We tried the White Corn Guacamole which was yummy. It was served with blue corn chips which I love. It was just the right amount of food for two people to have a few bites. Then we split the Moroccan Chicken Salad and Hawaiian pizza on whole wheat. The half salad was huge and delicious, packed with ingredients. I would just get that next time.  We finished off with the Chocolate Souffle Cake with Haagan-Daaz ice cream. It was warm and chocolaty. Yum! Definitely my pick to eat at the Florida Mall. They have some great new menu items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Wayne + Penny W.,"Coventry, CT",0,85,,4.0,2/14/2012,"LOML and I needed to refuel before we hit the airport and when you are in a rush, need good food with terrific service...we're talking CPK. We started with white corn guacamole and chips, moved on to the original BBQ chopped chicken salad and field green with shrimp. I added some Sadona tortilla soup, a couple of cokes, and we're off to the airport and back to CT. All the food is fresh, the restaurant impeccably clean and the wait staff efficient and friendly. What's not to like? We don't like chains but this is an exception. Great work by California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Scott R.,"Orlando, FL",75,7,19,3.0,10/26/2010,"The pizza is actually good. However, every time I come here the service sucks. This time there was no greeter. I sat at the table for over 5 minutes without a server coming because he was, according to a girl who appeared to be a manager, ""overwhelmed"" by a large party. She also appeared to be overwhelmed herself. So, this place really needs to stop cutting corners on the employees or no more visits for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Eladio D.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,7,4.0,3/23/2013,The food is great . Ashley is excellent. But the carpet still has a musty odor . They need to replace it.  I would put ceramic tile.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Jamie S.,"Melbourne, FL",35,285,55,3.0,5/12/2012,Surprisingly tasty food. Decent prices. Very slow service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Laura V.,"Apopka, FL",95,142,16,3.0,3/25/2011,Pretty decent.  I got the Buffalo Chicken Pizza thin crust.  Our waiter was pleasant and helpful.  The pizza was really good.  We also got the guacamole.  Don't it isn't so much guac as it is chopped up avocado with tomato.  It was weird.  I would go back.  On a Saturday night at 8 we were sat right away and the Waiter was just great.  He went above and beyond for us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Terri W.,"Orlando, FL",10,7,,4.0,7/19/2008,"I had lunch here today after shopping with my niece for dresses to the upcoming Mama Mia show at Bob Carr.  I like this location better than the one at the Millenia Mall, even though I hardly ever go to the Florida Mall.  I tried the Chipotle Chicken Pizza and it was very good, the best I have had so far.  It claims to be spicy, but I didn't think it was.  My niece had the Pasta Bolognese, basically spaghetti with meat sauce.  I didn't try it, but she said it was very good. We split the brownie sundae for dessert (her choice) and it was very yummy.  We weren't going to split it because I was way too full, but when it came to the table, I definitely had my share. I am throwing in an extra star because our server Michelle was excellent, even though they were on a wait and very busy.  She was there with the refills, and right off when I ordered iced tea, she brought an extra glass of ice without my asking (I love ice in my drinks!) and a tall tea spoon so I wouldn't have to stir my tea with a straw.  That's a small gesture, but registered well with me because I grew up with a mom who noticed these things.  She also gave me extra lemons.  I am sure this was to also save her time as well, but that's okay with me.  She patiently answered my niece's questions as well.  Ask for her, she is that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Mike D.,"Philadelphia, PA",59,404,29,2.0,1/17/2010,"If I had to be a fan of any type of chain restaurant, the pizza ones would probably win out.  This place was not exceptional but it wasn't bad either.  I had the miso salad which was pretty big for a half size order.  I think the salads are made with too much dressing to make up for the lack of real flavor in them.  Since I got my dressing on the side, my salad lacked any real taste even though there were a decent amount of different ingredients in there.  My buddy's salad was hard to finish for him because it was soaked in ranch dressing and it made  his stomach hurt.  The pizza looked pretty good and I imagine that's what most get but I just wasn't in the mood for a crazy pizza.  For a place right in the mall I guess you can't go wrong but for the prices of their food I think you can do much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
David C.,"Reno, NV",124,22,26,5.0,8/24/2010,"Food was good!! Potion was just perfect price was a little expensive, the server and service was perfect.. Got there at 4 wasn't busy at all. Probably the best time to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
Amie B.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",9,50,3,5.0,6/29/2013,"i just went here with my brother for veteran's day. he got free pizza for vet's day, and he started talking to a manager, and was saying how he almost feels a bit bad for getting all this free food on veterans day, which seems like its for those guys that get blown up and such, to make up for that, and not for the guy who just gets coffee for those guys, who is also technically a veteran even if never in combat. it was my idea to bring that up to someone else, since he was telling it to me, and the man patiently listened to him, then smiled, and reminded him that even the guy getting coffee for the air force pilots and such are part of the machine, and they help it run, so theres no reason to feel guilty for it. the coffee is just an example, he did much more important stuff than that, but he didnt feel like it. but he made my brother feel so much better, and was so sweet. i liked that. i didnt know it then, but just being in the military DID takea huge toll on us all, it wasnt nonsense, he did deserve it, and much more than that, because now hes missing and now i have no one to take me to CPK anymore",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2
