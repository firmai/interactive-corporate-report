34,Carolyn E.,"Delaware, OH",28,185,202.0,3.0,2012-01-15,"I generally don't like Red Robin, no matter the location - there's  too much stuff on their food, yet not enough flavor for my taste.  However, I did enjoy my last visit where I split one of the seafood baskets with my Mom, who suggested we go there.  The waitress had no problem with this set up as we both got a cup of clam chowder to round it out.   The meal overall was pretty good, one of the better experiences I've had at any branch of this chain, with the seafood tasting very fresh and not too greasy despite being fried. The basket also came with fries, and I was a bit upset at first to see a bunch of the fries laying in grease that had dripped off the seafood, rendering them, in my opinion, inedible.  Not a problem, though.  The server got me a fresh basket of fries which were very good. We did decline dessert - the desserts at this chain are never as good as they sound imo.  They also are known for their milkshakes, if you prefer one of those as a sweet treat, though again, I am not a fan of theirs in particular.  I personally like shakes to be so thick that you need a spoon to eat them - super thin, whipped ice cream.  Red Robins' are okay if you like the more milk-like shakes, I guess.  I also like that you can ask to sample a flavor if you are hesitant to try something.   Atmosphere is the typical Red Robin...heck, typical U.S. mid-level ""let's party"" chain.  ....i.e. there's so much stuff on the walls you can't see the paint.  Some of the items are pretty interesting, though.  Lots of old movie posters.  Overall, everything is very shiny and brightly colored.   It also isn't horribly noisy, though it's definitely not a place for a quiet romantic dinner either.   Service is fine - friendly, efficient - no complaints.   Overall, its' a decent place, especially if you have kids.  They'll love the bright colors and milkshakes.  It's not my favorite chain, but it's not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee?start=20,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

I ordered a burger and specifically asked that the burger and egg on the burger be well cooked because I have dietary restrictions but when the burger came, the inside was raw and the egg was runny.  Usually, I don't like to send back food but it was too raw for me to eat so I sent it back.  I usually would give a lower rating because they messed up my order even though I gave specific instructions, but the waitress and the manager were super nice.

10,Dustin M. R.,"Pemberville, OH",5,61,76.0,3.0,2015-08-03,"My wife and I went to Red Robin for a 2pm lunch hoping that it would not be crazy busy.  Unfortunately for us, the restaurant was still crazy busy. While we were seated almost immediately at a table, it took almost 5 minutes for our waitress to come over.  Since we had plenty of time to stare at the menu, we went ahead and ordered our full meal, rather than just drinks.  We ordered a guacamole burger on a gluten-free bun, a southern charm burger with sweet potato fries, a Dr. Pepper, and rootbeer float.  Before tax and tip, our bill came to $33.74. Décor in the restaurant was vintage movies, which we liked, but had a hard time enjoying because it was so freaking loud. The music was loud, which caused the patrons around us to have to yell to be heard, which might not have been so bad if they were not 10 inches away from us on the other side of the partition separating our tables. Since the restaurant was busy we expected it to take a while to get our food ... and we were not disappointed. Once it finally arrived, our food looked great and tasted great, but both of our sandwiches were very messy and drippy. In fact, once I finished my sandwich, I excused myself to the restroom to wash my hands, as the one napkin I had could not hope to accomplish the job.  We also liked the endless fries, but quickly discovered that our table's ketchup bottle only had about a tablespoon of the good stuff left, and had to flag down a waitress for another bottle.  Additionally we found the food portion sizes to be typical for the prices.  Our harried but friendly waitress checked back with us a couple times during our meal and brought us a drink refill when asked. Overall we rate Red Robin as being Good, and would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-maumee,,,,,

I ended up going with Red because it was closer. I sat at the bar. I had to wait and no one was sitting at the bar other than myself. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce, lettuce and pickles. I waited for quite awhile on this burger. It wasn't what I ordered. It had no bacon, no bbq sauce or cheese on it. You'd figure with the long wait it would come out correctly. Then they just threw a couple strips of bacon and hardly any bbq sauce on it mind you they brought me a piece of cheese on a separate plate instead of having it melted on the burger. I also had an onion ring in with my fries. After all that for them to claim the have gourmet burgers is a little far fetched in my opinion. I was highly disappointed in the taste and quality.
