This establishment is the WORST run restaurant I have ever seen.  I can't believe they r still open! Absolute chaos!  And the staff are the not trained well & the most unprofessional food service staff I can remember.  Facts:  Visit  10/19/13 Saturday night Once our party placed our order it took over 45 mins to get the appetizers. The server apologized n said the ""kitchen crashed"" and ""the entire ordering system was down!"" But from that point it was still 20 minutes before any food was brought to the table.  Tables that came in 30 mins after us got there entrees before we got ours! When we finally got our dinner it took almost an hour mine was not my order! After all that I wasn't even right?  I told serve h took it back. It took 10 mins to get the right item...and it still wasn't my order!   Now on latest attempt it was not prepared as requested an served with a sauce I cannot eat because of a food allergy as I told my server when I placed the order.  ??? Every table around us was losing their minds complaining asking to see the manager. The manager took 20 minutes to show his face. By that time every table was comparing ""issues"".  Consensus was ""never ever, ever again!  Worst Fridays experience ever!"" People were waiting for more than 30 mins just to get an accurate check n settle it? Really! The ship is going down in a hurry and the captain doesn't have a clue! The worst dining nightmare of my life over almost 3 hours and at that point the only concession I was offered was the item that could have made me very sick I wasn't charged for?  Actually the first check wasn't even correct. I had to show the server his mistake. So even taking inordinate time to provide the most basic of services was not enough to even get things satisfactory or really substandard! I couldn't even get a bill that was ""looked over"" for accuracy after waiting for it for more than 30 mins!

50,F. T.,"Plainfield, NJ",10,40,91.0,1.0,2013-10-21,"Went to TGIF on Sunday 10/20/2013 for lunch with my partner and his mom.  Waiter was very nice but seemed a bit flustered.  Our lunches were brought out with an issue on each. 1- My partner ordered the triple stack Reuben and asked for very well done fries (this assures that they are fresh and not coming from under a heat lamp).  The order arrived with soggy, warm fries. The waiter asked him ""are they well done enough for you?"".  After my partner tasted them and responded that they were not hot or crisp, the waiter said that he would bring another order, which arrived the same way the first order arrived. 2- My partners mom ordered the skillet garlic shrimp.  She loved it EXCEPT for the fact that it had 7 large, uncooked cloves of garlic in it. Nothing ruins your taste buds like biting into raw garlic.   3- I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp.  Just as disgusting as it gets.  The shrimp (with tails on) came in an acidic, bitter tomato sauce.  The grilled chicken (which was on melted yellow American cheese) was so over cooked that the two small pieces were the size of a jumbo egg.  After fighting with two shrimps to remove the tails without making a huge mess, I just gave up.  The waiter came to our table twice, saw that my plate was intact and never asked if there was anything wrong with the meal.  Finally, he came to give us our check and I told him that my dish was just disgusting and I, obviously did not like it.  He said that he would send a manager over.   The manager who came to our table was the a piece to the puzzle as to why the kitchen did not know which end was up.  She made excuses about everything.  I pointed out the large, uncooked  garlic on my partners moms dish.  The manager claims that they make their dish that way and even oven roast their garlic daily.  From where I was sitting, the garlic was raw and never saw the inside of an oven.  As for my dish, she claims that the gentleman who wrote their menu is now a multimillionaire.  I would gather that if that was the case, Fridays over paid tremendously.   Stay away from this place unless you enjoy having smoke blown up your behind from the waitstaff to the management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=80,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000004

40,Paul C.,"Rockaway, NJ",26,6,1.0,1.0,2014-07-27,"If I could rate this place 0 stars, I would. This is not my first time to a Friday's, so the account of my time here is ENTIRELY due to a horrible staff and disgusting practices. I went here with a friend of mine for dinner date. The moment I walked in it was a NIGHTMARE. The hostess told someone to ""Get out her face"" and then proceeded to ignore us walking in the door. Another girl just grabbed a few menus, more than our party of two needed, and sat us directly next to the kitchen and bathrooms. When I asked for different seating, she ignored me entirely and walked away. Our waitress came over after 20 minutes and when I said hello she just looked at me like I had three heads, then asked if we'd like something to drink. I ordered a cherry coke (which I had to explain not only what I meant by cherry, but also grenadine syrup) and my date ordered water, as we were already fearing the worst. After another 20 minutes, she came out with the two drinks, placed them in the wrong locations on the table, then walked away. After yet another 10 minutes she returned and asked us if we wanted to order, something she should have asked when she brought our drinks. My date ordered the 3 appetizers Thai pork tacos, Ahi Tuna Crisps, and the Corn beef and Swiss sliders. I ordered the 6oz Jack Daniel's steak and shrimp with spinach and mac and cheese sides. This all started coming out nearly 40 minutes after placing our order. Starting with the appetizers...they came out one at a time, despite my asking for them to come out at the same time. The Thai pork tacos were DISGUSTING. Unseasoned, no sauce, and the taco shell they were on was soggy, wet, and tasted old. They were so bad I almost threw up after my date insisted I try it. The Ahi Tuna Crisps were only slightly better, with the tuna being cooked unevenly, and had the consistency of rubber. The ""crisps"" they were on was also soggy. The corned beef and Swiss sliders were dry, the swiss tasted almost like cleaning products, and were inedible. My meal was a true tragedy. The plate I was warned is ""very hot,"" but upon touching it, I was shocked to feel it nearly ice cold. Presentation was non existent, as the steak had a half melted pad of butter placed on top, the greens were tossed clearly from one end of the plate to the other making the entire plate covered in water, and the shrimp were sitting, soaking up the water from the greens, making their batter soggy. The mac & cheese came out 20 minutes after I had begun eating. The steak was like a piece of shoe leather, and it was not a Jack Daniel's steak. It was a regular 6 oz sirloin that was not done Medium, as I asked...it was instead so well done, there was nothing left of it. After mentioning this to the waitress, she quickly got then tossed Jack Daniel's sauce onto my table in a little cup and walked away immediately. The shrimp were over cooked and as I mentioned before, soggy. The greens were hardly cooked at all, and were mixed in with onions and mushrooms that come with the regular sirloin. After taking a bite, I tasted something with the consistency of sand in the greens. I was terrified and stopped eating them immediately. The mac & cheese, which was cold by the time it came out, was so god awful. I tasted it and there was NO cheese. It was noodles, which were not fully cooked, topped with bread crumbs. After a miserable night, and after not seeing the manager despite my asking, I payed the bill, regretfully. I will never...ever...EVER in my life return to this place. If you have any common sense, STAY AWAY FROM THIS FRIDAY'S!

Our waitress took 10 minutes just to bring us water. The people eating around us were very loud and kids were kicking the backs of our chair a lot, so we moved ourselves. We got our appetizer first which was good. Then my husband got his food first. Which is odd because usually all restaurants bring all the food together unless you tell them not to. I waited 20 minutes to get my food, thus I couldn't enjoy dinner together with my husband. The waitress actually gave my food to the wrong table that's why it took a long time. When we asked to talk to the manager, he didn't look professional. I complained and said that your waitress has an attitude and all he did was take $2 off the bill. Then finally when we were paying and signing our bill and writing the tip in, the waitress didn't even wait until we left our table to get the check book. She opened the book in front of us to see the tip and gave us a dirty look. Worst service ever!!!

This burger was SUPPOSED to come out with two parties, mozzarella sticks, marinara sauce, and cheese. And from my pictures you can TELL the first burger they placed in front of me was an insult. I had asked the waiter to bring me mayonnaise thinking this was want the burger was supposed to be. It was the driest burger ever! Two bites in I realize I can't manage to finish this dry burger. It's the equivalent to swallowing sandpaper. He gets the manager and she takes one look at my sandwich and KNOWS her kitchen staff messed up badly. I tell her I just wanna get the brownie dessert and forget about giving me another burger.  Here's where the better part is! She sends me my dessert AND what the BEAUTIFUL new burger that my first burger was supposed to be with a full plate of fries. She tells me that the burger is free and that I can take it home. It looked so much better I couldn't help but to take a bite out of it and it tastes BEYOND BETTER.  Would I come back here...possibly. A strong maybe. I'm sad my main entree wasn't as good as my coworkers at the times they were eating it, but the manager gave me excellent customer service.

I've travelled extensively and have yet to encounter this situation in even the poorest countries. Bathrooms were frightening, both women's and men's. Out of 4 stalls, 3 were unflushed and the 4th had t.p. hanging off the seat into the bowl. There was a dried brown substance above the door handle. Sinks were sopping wet with paper towels overflowing the bin. I realize these are the disgusting habits of customers, but aren't staff supposed to check/clean the bathrooms every so often?  Service was slower than a snail: It took 5 minutes to be seated as the hostess couldn't be found. And later, when she could be found, appeared to be chatting up a guy at the front (who, despite sitting on a stool behind the podium next to the hostess, didn't appear to be staff...)  Similarly we lost our waitress after our entrees were served. After clicking the ""call server"" button on the tabletop tablet and waiting for 15 minutes, we finally got up and walked to the hostess stand to ask for assistance in finding our server. The hostess said she'd find our server but continued to sit there entertaining her friend. Perhaps she used ESP? The food was good, but that's not surprising considering it's shipped pre-cooked to each location and then simply warmed up. And the server was sweet - when she was around. It's not her fault they didn't have clean silverware.      I'm very surprised corporate office allows this to happen.
