Thomas V.,"Irvine, CA",843,106,310,3.0,1/11/2017,"I really do enjoy their food, but it can be hit or miss at times. But that seems like a common theme among most chain restaurants. However, the food I generally get at this BJ's is usually well made.  This particular BJ's is situated at the Tustin Marketplace among a variety of different restaurants. It is located on the corner of Jamboree and Irvine Blvd. Parking can be an issue at times since the area is packed with many different shops and restaurants, but I usually am able to find parking without too much trouble. This BJ's is pretty large and there is a waiting area for those waiting to pick up food or waiting to be seated. The inside is usually pretty clean and the tables are well kept.  The food is the same food you would find at any BJ's, so I'll talk more about the execution. I've had the sirloin steak at several different BJ's and have never been disappointed by the quality of the steak at this location. I've also had several other dishes and have usually not been disappointed. The service at this BJ's is also usually very good, all of the staff and friendly and helpful. Overall, this BJ's is a solid choice if you're looking for some good quality chain restaurant food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20
Rebekkah C.,"Orange County, CA",598,385,3805,4.0,12/17/2016,"SOLID FOOD and GREAT SERVICE!  Complimentary meal valued under $12.95 to all Military Veterans. Staff were nice and friendly. We were greeted with a smile and was seated outside to enjoy the fresh air. Food we had were good and came in a timely manner. We had.. -AVOCADO EGGROLLS- Yummy!!! Crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. A bit greasy but tasty. -SPAGHETTI and MEATBALS (lunch portion)- Portion was still big and easily filled me up. Meatballs were perfectly cooked and noodles weren't soggy. It was delicious and I'd get it again.  -BISON BURGER- El Hubby enjoyed it. It was his complimentary meal. Grilled buffalo patty with bbq sauce, green chiles and pico de gallo. It was lean yet very flavorful and delicious. Highly recommend it.  -TATONKA STOUT- A rich dark beer with hints of coffee or chocolate. Get it.  Our server was really nice and attentive. She checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed. She was also knowledgeable with the menu esp with drinks. She recommended her favs and gave El hubby beer samples to try.  Overall, it was a good experience. I highly recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20

Jacqueline K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",919,153,932,1.0,6/18/2017,"Stopped by around 11pm because of late night cravings for pizookies. First time trying BJ's pizookies & was such a disappointment!!  Ordered the SALTED CARAMEL pizookie & BJ'S FAVORITE pizza. Both were awful & tasted like store bought/pre-made food. I could've bought Albertsons' cookies + vanilla ice cream + frozen pizza & had a more delectable meal. To top it off, service was meh & seemed like they all hated their jobs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20
Bruce A.,"Corona, CA",22,51,26,4.0,11/17/2017,"Mini Sweet Pig Pizza is my favorite. Couple that with a wedge salad, and some appetizers = I'm quite full. No room for a Pazooki today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20
Amado S.,"Tustin, CA",0,7,1,1.0,11/21/2017,"This review is based on ordering take out. Two nights ago I ordered boneless wings, avocado egg rolls, 2 side salads and a pazookie. My girlfriend went to pick it up about 25 minutes later since they told us it would be ready in 25-30 minutes. 45 minutes later, I get a phone call from her that the food is still not ready. About 10 minutes later from that point, I get a call that she finally got the food and she was on the way home. We live literally 2 minutes from this location. When she got home, the wings and avocado egg rolls were soggy and cold. How were they like this if the food was not ready on time and we supposedly got the food right as it was prepared? To top it all off, the pazookie was burnt.  I love BJ's and have never had a bad experience dining in, but their take out was terrible. It was a waste of my ~$35 because I tossed the wings, avocado egg rolls and pazookie in the trash. At least the ice cream was good..... guess they couldn't really mess that one up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20
Joe J.,"Irvine, CA",8,77,26,3.0,12/10/2017,"The Buffalo Chicken Pizza is the only way to go! Everytime I come here, I always say I'm going to try something different but once I look at the menu, my taste buds just gravitate right back to the Buffalo Chicken Pizza! Get it! The only reason why I didn't give a 5 star is because sometimes when I get my pizza they don't put enough chicken. They should really focus on putting more meat on their pizzas",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20

Grace B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",238,458,279,5.0,4/22/2017,"I am the last person that would ever be up for a corporate establishment for dinner. I just prefer my hole in the walls. The other night though, we were celebrating a birthday and this is where everyone chose to go so I made the best of it. It must have just been my night, cause we started off with impeccable service by Sam. He was one of the most genuine and friendliest servers I have had in a while. He patiently answered all our questions, was quick to acknowledge us if we ever needed anything, and consistently came by our table to check on us. We started with his recommended appetizer of the sampler plate since we didn't know which ones to choose from. It came with buffalo chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, spinach artichoke dip with chips, and avocado egg rolls. We all devoured it. Next, for my meal, I chose the barbacoa chicken and substituted the brown rice for coleslaw. The chicken was seasoned wonderfully and the flavor of the whole dish was great. My husband had the buffalo burger wrapped in lettuce and preferred my meal to his. Others ordered regular burgers and had no complaints. I couldn't keep my fingers off everyone's fries. They really do their burgers and fries like a burger dedicated restaurant. I'm pretty impressed, they're definitely doing something right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20
Michelle D.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/28/2017,"Great if you are there....not a great grubhub delivery experience. Got our order on time, however it should have been 2 burgers with fries and two add on wedge salads. Received 2 burgers, no fries and 4 add on salads...which they charged me for 4. When I called, they said, ""that must be frustrating, your fries are here if you want to come pick them up."" Really? I paid $2.99 for them to pack up the food. Paid 15% tip. Paid the delivery man $5 tip and paid a fee for Grubhub. Soooooo not worth the chance to get food delivery. Better to call it in, go, check it, leave and go home.

Bryan M.,"San Jose, CA",389,3,,1.0,11/28/2017,"Went there late night on a Saturday after work. Hostess directed us towards the bar. We sat waiting at our table for ten minutes, only to be passed by the bald waiter as he greeted a table who walked in during the ten minutes after us. He then proceeded to walk back to the POS station near the bar. I had to physically walk up to him and ask him for assistance. I was hungry and refused to wait to be noticed any longer but if I had who knows how long it would take to be noticed. Our table was in plain sight. Super annoyed at service, or should I say the lack thereof.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20

Yoshie M.,"Hemet, CA",4,35,29,5.0,6/17/2017,"My husband and I have talked about going to BJ's many times before but never did, until today.  We got there around 6pm the day before Father's Day. The place was packed with 30 to 40 min. wait. My husband HATES wait! However, the hostess suggested because we were just two of us we could get seated at the bar tables. So we did. Thanx to the hostess! A server came right away! Tiana was very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered 2 Ribs Pork Chop and 15oz Prime Rib. Pork chop was at least 2 inch thick, and perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned! The best pork chop I have ever tasted. Prime Rib was tender and flavorful and minimum of fat.  Pizooki came with Prime Rib dinner. Huge, freshly baked cookie ( many choices) with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. Yum! My husband said he would definitely come back, which he rarely say. Great food. Great service.   Btw, they gave my husband a ""Happy Father's Day"" glass and a 20% off coupon card for Father's Day.

Christina S.,"Irvine, CA",147,118,40,1.0,8/15/2017,"Service from the hostess the last few times at this location have been unpleasant and rude.   We just went this past Sunday as a party of 10 and my friend called me to let me know that she called in to put her name down.  When I arrived, I told the hostess, Liza or Elisa (was given both these names from different people), that we had reservations for 10.  She told me that there wasn't any reservations under that name and that there wasn't any reservations for 10 people.   Fine.  She continues to look at me with a blank stare so I asked her to put my name down and she said FINE.  Straight out glared at me and had so much attitude that I really was ready to walk out.  Does she not know that she's the greeter and is supposed to be pleasant and inviting?  No one taught her this working as a hostess at a family restaurant?   We were never asked if we were ok with the patio and that's where our table was set up.  It was 90 degrees out and the ceiling fan was basically a joke.  We were drenched in sweat.

Abbe W.,"Irvine, CA",618,617,1263,4.0,8/24/2016,"My family and I were there last week and found out that they now have a rewards plan.  Through the sign up, we found out about the Prime Rib Tuesday Special so we came to check it out. It's a three course dinner meal for $27.99 (I think).   The appetizer course had a choice of soup or salad.  My first choice was The Wedge but I really wanted to try the Twisted BLT, which was very good and light.  There wasn't any ""L"" but more of ""S"" for spinach.  Perfect size to get started. The main course was of course the Prime Rib.  My meat was medium rare.  It was done perfectly and paired with Roasted Brussel Sprouts, rice pilaf and 14oz goodness.  The au ju's and horseradish were very nice addon.  I couldn't finish it so brought some for lunch.  The dessert course was the signature pizookie.  My husband and I thought it was the mini pizookie but instead it's the full size.  So we had two pizzokies.  I would have been happy with just a mini but the full size definitely filled up the sugar level! Overall, it was very nice dinner.  The special is only on Tuesday selected BJ's so please check your local BJ's.  It's also limited so go early for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20

If you come here with that mindset, you'll love this restaurant. Don't expect to get gourmet meals. You go somewhere else for that. Service is always great. It can get very crowded, especially during Happy Hours. As for #Thinsulin approved green light drinks, go for the wine or hard liquor on the rocks, but avoid the red light drinks such as beers and mixed drinks since they spike insulin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20
Jake A.,"Irvine, CA",538,167,53,4.0,4/6/2017,"My wife has been talking about half-off pizza Mondays for... a long time. So we got the large deep dish classic BJ's whatever pizza and it was sooo good. We normally grab domino's or little caesar's on the go or a quick slice or for group events, and I think I forgot what a good deep dish pizza tastes like! Obviously, I'm not comparing to authentic Chicago deep dish or anything like that, but you know what I mean. It was only about 12 bucks and it could definitely feed three people. The avocado egg-rolls may say that it comes with six pieces, but it's really six HALF PIECES. When I bit into the deliciousness I forgot how upset I was about feeling jipped on the half pieces. But I won't drop 11 bucks for that again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=20
Karis K.,"Irvine, CA",27,14,,1.0,7/20/2017,"I know this is a chain and it's convenient to go to, but spend your money elsewhere. Some family and I went last night as a group of 4 and I called in 30 minutes ahead to put our name down on their 'waitlist'. Once we arrived, the host checked us in, but then said the wait would be another 20 minutes? Why would I bother being on the waitlist then? Luckily we were seated within 10 minutes not 20. SERVICE: Waitress was nice, but never came to our table at the right time. I had to FLAG DOWN waiters or waitresses to take our order, add to our order, and get refills many times. Our drinks were never filled unless we asked and even then, they would only fill the person who has the least water, but not everyone?!  FOOD: We all weren't feeling pizza so we opted for 3 pasta dishes and their new quinoa dish. -Thai Soba Noodles: Poorly cooked and came as a mush of broken soba noodles. Flavor was okay. -Fettuccini Alfredo: Super sticky -Jambalaya: I asked for pasta instead of rice, which maybe was my mistake, but this was the WORST Jambalaya I've ever had (and this is a go to dish for me at most restaurants). SUPER BLAND. How could you do that to a Jambalaya? The noodles had absolutely no flavor at all except for a bit of olive oil and the peppers, shrimp, sausage, and chicken were all poorly seasoned. DO NOT ORDER NOT WORTH THE $. -Quinoa dish: Unless you really need to watch your weight, no even then I wouldn't suggest this dish. Absolutely NO flavor. My mom had to put Siracha with every bite just to eat it. Pizookies were good so there is a star for that, but they should be good it's their signature. Just think twice about coming here because things have changed at this chain and not for the better. I used to go many times about 4-5 years ago, but now I won't be back for a long while.

The service from the staff is badddddd  it's sad because I visit different locations and they all have great food and service but not sure what's wrong here. Oh well I guess the manager doesn't care about training his staff to be more helpful or at least try to serve us that we just come to eat something good enjoy the food but can't when everyone here has long faces and can't even come to see if we are okay.

Elizah C.,"Corona, CA",62,2,,5.0,12/24/2017,"Absolutely FANtastic service and experience. I have to say tons of people will easily go out of their way to write complaints to receive compensation, but very few will to recognize prestige service. Haven't been to a BJ's in a while due to a few reasons. We came in last night 12/23 celebrating Friendsmas there was 7 of us, got sat on the patio which we weren't too happy with first off and the host could be a tad happier, it is the holidays. It took a brief moment for us to be greeted by Anthony our server who we noticed was quite busy so no worries. He came and Greeted us with a very warming and apologetic opening for the slight wait, took our drink order and was very knowledgeable, especially with all of us wanting to try new and different drinks. He then helped us choose a few appetizers and we asked him to surprise us with some as well, he made great choices must I say. I do have to say being a people watcher I was noticing how meticulous and organized he is with his tables and tables prioritizing "" me being a server for 15 years"" started to get a little empathic when I over heard a table complaining and talking about issues that were out of his control and not paying enough attention when he alone seemed to have almost a 1/3 of that huge patio! When our entrees came out he was completely on top of everything to make sure each dish was out and correct along with any condiments needed. must I also say we didn't once need to remind him for drink refills or removing dishes as needed. As for our dessert we provided our own alone with a few great pizookis and Anthony cleared out our whole table and set it for dessert as if we were eating at Mastros without even having to ask. WOW! With his load and continuing up with everyone! I hope to Have that gentleman as my server ever time I come BJ's from here on out!!! Bravo Service! Please be sure to thank Anthony for us as we were in a rush after paying! Merry Christmas Anthony & BJ's !!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=40
Teri Y.,"Irvine, CA",0,7,3,2.0,12/23/2017,Review is pertaining to delivery only. Saw that they offer delivery now so we ordered a pizza and appetizer to be delivered at 7pm.  Delivery guy showed up late at 7:30 which was fine but when we opened our food both the pizza and fried calamari was cold.  Not sure how long it was sitting out before it got delivered to us. We've never had a pizza that got delivered cold. They need to learn from other pizzeria and figure out how to deliver our pizza hot. Very disappointed.

Tina S.,"Tustin, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/14/2017,"We have been to other BJ locations in  LA and other cities. It's a decent restaurant and with the new menu they have added a lot of different cuisines as well as vegetarian choices. I would usually rate them 3.5/5. But this BJ's Jamboree location disappoints me third time in row. Each time we have gone the service has been below average. The server comes once  to take your order and that's it. If you need plates, want to order any additional food or drinks, you have to wait forever. First 2 times we went, we ordered vegetarian pizza, explained them no meat. Yet both the times we found meat pieces in the slice. We thought of trying third time today after almost a year since their menu was changed. But neither the deep dish pizza was good nor the service.

Worse part when the pizza arrived it was just warm. Cheese hard and totally tasteless. When I told our waitress she asked if I wanted it to be reheated. Wtf?!  Reheated?!  No I don't want you to nuke it in the microwave. All along we are still waiting for our salad. After having almost done eating the pizza the salad arrived.  Apparently the salad department was backed up.  Lame. After not having been there for quite some time, I don't think I'll ever go back.

Margaret L.,"Fullerton, CA",23,126,53,4.0,5/15/2017,"We came to BJ's for my graduation celebration.  Initially, one month before my graduation, we had talked to an employee named Daniel.  Daniel allegedly arranged everything for my graduation celebration.  My boyfriend spoke to Daniel on several occasions.  On the Thursday before my graduation, my boyfriend decided to go to BJ's (in person) to confirm with Daniel, for the last time, about our graduation accommodations.  Daniel was not there.  My boyfriend then talked to another woman, who was in a managerial capacity.  The woman said she had no idea who my boyfriend was, and that no reservations had been placed under his name, nor mine.  We were outraged.  The woman then put our names in, and told us she did not know what Daniel had arranged, but she would TRY and accommodate us.   On the day of my graduation celebration, we did not have the sides of the patio.  Our guests did not get to eat ""buffet"" style, as people generally tend to eat more when it is in a ""buffet"" style.  Rather, we were crammed in two elongated tables, with little to no room for anyone to mingle and talk.  The guests segregated themselves as the way the tables were set up did not allow anyone to mingle with one another much.   I was very displeased.  It was then that my boyfriend and I got the attention of a general manager, Ricky.  Ricky did everything and anything to accommodate us.  He made sure my two tables (along with our guests) were well taken care of.  He basically saved the day.  The four stars I am giving BJ's is for people like Ricky.  Ricky was a people person that day.  Because of him, I was content, my guests - happy and full.  Many of the guests that I was with even said that they would be coming back to BJ's because of their exceptional service.  THANK YOU RICKY.   The lack of the 5th star is for people like Daniel.  Because every employer is responsible for their employees (as BJ's is for Daniel), they should honor what Daniel had agreed upon with us, and hold him accountable.  Although we did not get the side of the patio as was previously agreed nor did we get food served in a ""buffet"" style as opposed to ""family"" style (which is what we got), our guests, nonetheless, ended up content.  We had plenty of food to give the guests to take home.   Upon leaving BJ's, I ran into another one of my fellow law school graduates.  I made sure she knew about Ricky, and told her that if she needed anything, to definitely talk to Ricky.

Had the salted caramel one and sampled the double chocolate one and omigoodness that was some heavenly chocolate. It tasted like a chocolate brownie topped with chocolate ice cream.

Abby G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,3,2,1.0,8/22/2017,"Oh boy. We have enjoyed visiting BJ's for weekly date night for years with the understanding that we are guaranteed an ice, cold West Coast IPA Green Flash. We noticed it was not on the menu for many months so they discontinued recently because it was not ordered often enough. Very strange. The best part was that we found Lazy Dog serves it (not as cold) and we went there to find all the servers from BJ's at the bar drinking Green Flash. Do the people who are actually in the restaurant (patrons/employees) have any say in decisions?

Cuong N.,"Irvine, CA",7,232,358,2.0,7/29/2017,"We've always gone to BJ's for father's day as it's a small tradition amongst our family.   Unfortunately, the past few years have been abit trying. We were seated outside.  It was hot this father's day.  If you're planning to seat us outside, please at least turn on the ceiling fans and have fans for use outside. But more importantly was the food.   It tasted like frozen food reheated.   My sister in law she ordered the prime rib special.  They asked for medium... it came out well done.  It was dry and salty too.  Another person in our group ordered pork chops but they were just way to salty.  I bumped this to 2 stars because they did replace the order with baby back ribs. After eating here, I'd say I'll take my chances with Norms rather then eat here again.  My wife used to eat here alot when she went to college, but says the food has changed alot since then (that was about 10 years ago) (she's just referring to the chain as a whole...other locations we've had the same sub par experience)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=40
Rosalie B.,"Lower Peters Canyon, Irvine, CA",133,1,,2.0,1/9/2018,"I went here on Jan. 6th for my sister's birthday and we asked for a table of four plus a high chair. They told us they would text us when our table was ready, so we waited. We got a text, so we went up to the front to get seated and this host just asked for our name and she looked at us like we were stupid because I guess she didn't see that they texted us. Then, another host realized that he didn't put our slip with our table, so he handed it to the host who looked at us like we were stupid. We arrive to our table and we see three chairs and a high chair. She rolled her eyes and said are you going to need another chair ? And we said yeah like it's common sense, so she sighs and adds another chair. And she tells us next time you have to say five people including the high chair with a major attitude. At this point, I've had it with her attitude, so I gave her attitude back and said that we said 4 people and a high chair. Idk, how hard it is to get that right. I worked at a restaurant and people would tell me that and I would understand that it means four chairs and a high chair. She ends up slamming the silverware on our table and says well you can talk to my manager like she didn't care. The manager ended up coming saying I heard you aren't happy with your table and we said that weren't at all it was with the service that we had receive. We explained what had happened and that we understand that it's overwhelming sometimes working a restaurant when it's busy, but that doesn't give her the right to treat customers like that. The manager just said okay I agree, we will go over it with her. Like that is gonna make up for having been treated horribly. Our server was very kind and made up for the horrible hostess experience. I wish I would have read the name of the hostess so I could right it on here. The food was good. I just didn't enjoy my whole time there because of the hostess. I won't be coming at this location again that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=40
Rob L.,"Irvine, CA",4734,412,1621,4.0,4/3/2016,"I haven't been to a BJ's in maybe 10 years or longer.  My initial impression when I visited the Irvine location today was that nothing much has changed.  I was actually quite surprised by the lack of technology at the reception area. They don't use any form of pagers.  They don't ask for your phone number or text you when your table is ready.  Instead, the hostesses will scream your name at the top of her lungs in the noisy lobby when your table is ready.  Just like the way they do it in those traditional Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. However, the menu has changed quite a bit since the last time I was at a BJ's. It was definitely more extensive, and more contemporary and creative. We ordered a BJ's Brewhouse Classic flatbread which was topped with pepperonis, Italian sausages, and fresh mushrooms.  The potions of the toppings were very generous.  The cheese was what they call BJ's 5-cheese blend and it was very tasty, with a rich flavor of mozzarella, which I like.  The sauce was light, slightly tangy and sweet.  The crust was baked to almost perfection. We also ordered an Asian chopped salad and we were impressed that we were able to custom order it without green onions and cilantro.  (CPK on the other side of the Market Place would not and could not do it because their salads were pre-mixed).  BJ's is certainly a winner here and beat CPK by a TKO! The salad was made with a wide variety of baby greens, romaine lettuce, napa cabbage, shredded carrot, mandarin orange slices, among other goodies.  All the veggies tasted very fresh.  The thick slices of grilled chicken breast meat that came with the salad were yummy and tender.  The final magic touch was the delicious honey ginger dressing which sealed the deal of making it an amazing salad. Service has been friendly and efficient throughout our meal.  The mostly 70's or 80's classic rock vibes are cool.  The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing.  Overall, it was a very nice dining experience and quite a pleasant surprise.  Will definitely be back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=40

I made my way to the Seats and asked for ice.  The manager came by and apologized.  The Meal was terrible and they did nothing.

Don H.,"New York, NY",56,130,36,3.0,1/5/2018,"I don't know...  Sometimes it's hit or miss with BJ's. The last couple of times we were here the pizzas were undercooked; they tasted better when we took them home and put them in the toaster oven, but that's not saying much. The beer samplers used to be a gem - 6 samplers was the # but  now it's reduced to 4 without changing the price. Not cool. The service is a bit chaotic. We'll have anywhere between 3-4 servers. In theory I guess that makes for efficiency but call me ol' fashioned, I like the one on one server so that the tip is well earned.  Lastly, and perhaps the underlying reason for a 3 star. There are numerous times (3x too many) where for whatever reason we could see the frustration on the staff- and I get it, everyone has their day, especially in food/hospitality. But this was between two co-workers... Not sure if it was matre D v busboy or whatever but that was very visible to the public patrons...

Sticky booths, screaming day drinking suburbanites, and fair weather football fans. All of that plus a terrible deep dish. I tried the Buffalo Chicken variety and you are 100% correct, I deserve what I got.  The pie is all dough and no go. Dry and wood-tasting chicken breast chunks are combined with diced celery, red onions with a sloppy drizzle of ranch dressing, buffalo sauce and... well, that is the good part! The bad part is the 3/4 inch of too soft, almost mealy, doughy crust these things have going on. If this is an attempt at Chi-Town pie, BJ needs to actually go to Chicago someday because this is a disgusting attempt at a deep dish.  Bleh.  This pizza stings like a first divorce, or that first Newport... Whichever hurts you more. The second star is for having Stone IPA on draft and Famous Dave's is conveniently located next door.

Durell B.,"Irvine, CA",393,146,813,4.0,7/5/2017,"This is the other corporate chain spot that I can get down with because they are consistent across the board (which is what chains shoot for, I know) but they have a GOOD consistency; which doesn't always happen with chains. While I have been to other locations, I am happy to report that this one is the closet for me and probably the best.  The last time I was here was (7/2/17) with fellow Yelper Candice K and we had a good ole time.  We sat in the bar area left hand corner, which had a great view of multiple TVs. Candice wanted to check out the Angels game and it was on the big screen. The staff is very accommodating with the TVs (I assume as long as they have the channels and no other guests care too much). On this particular day our server was Bianca and she took great care of us. Initially we were catching up and talking for a while but that didn't stop her from checking in on us frequently which is much appreciated.  We finally were ready to order and we decided to go with: *App* Root Beer Glazed Wings --- I ordered them extra crispy and they came out very nice, crunchy but full of that sticky flavor glaze. Cooked thoroughly, so there are no complaints here. I would order again.  *Entrees* Full Rack Of Ribs --- Good glaze. Meaty and not too dry. I was kind of surprised because you never know if they will be too dry but I would order these again.  Rib Eye --- A very nice slab of meat. Cooked medium. Good flavor. Juicy *Sides* Green Beans --- Tender. Juicy. Not much to say. Overall good. Asparagus --- Seasoned well with the right amount of crunch.  *Drinks* House Blonde --- Cold and good tasting. *Dessert* Pizookie Trio --- Monkey Bread. White Chocolate. Peanut Butter. The PB was the definite hit out of the 3 for us with WC coming in second. MB was ok but may have been a little too sweet and not as soft, but it was ok.  I believe this is all we had and the experience was overall good. We were also able to take advantage of a BOGO entree which wasn't a bad deal at all. And our server was cool about it. I say that because I've been to places where you would present a coupon and sometimes the server would seem like they had an attitude with it or something. My thing is, if they weren't meant to be used then the company wouldn't have made them. And with that being said, make sure you tip appropriately; especially when you're getting a deal. A lot of servers work hard and coupons shouldn't cut into their bottom line.  All in all a good day and a good job from Bianca. I will be back.

My husband had the Black and Bleu burger, he said it was among the best, the patty was thick and juicy with lots of flavor. The bun was soaked in flavor which added to every bite.

On this particular trip, I went for a healthier option and was not disappointed. The meal itself was the perfect amount of food and tasty. I ordered their Peruvian Quinoa with Shrimp bowl.

BJs is known for their pizzas and pizookie desserts, so I totally recommend those, but not really anything else except their root beer. I got the unlimited soup and salad and it was honestly disappointing. The soups tasted like they were from a can, especially the clam chowder and chicken tortilla. The chicken tortilla was a disgrace by the way. It was thick and way too salty. Chicken tortilla soup should be clear and light. The salads were kinda unhealthy. Definitely ask for dressing on the side because they liked to drown their salads. I got the wedge which was covered in ranch and bacon  No thanks. The tomato salad was whatever. House salad was the only decent one because it was pretty much a normal salad with romaine, spring greens, carrots, etc. But hey, it's unlimited, so I brought some home. I like their normal cookie pizookies, so I decided to try the monkey bread version. Unless you like dense and thick chewy bread, this is your thing. I like my monkey bread fluff and light, so this was disappointing. Ice cream was delivered though, especially the chocolate Ghirardelli.

A thousand calories of fun!  Is there anything special from other BJ's? If there is I don't see it but that shouldn't bother anyone.

Matt K.,"Irvine, CA",12,263,416,4.0,10/6/2015,"BJ's has a really cool vibe, I especially like the bar area.  There are high top tables, bar seating, but also booth seating within the bar area.  I put my name down for a regular table in the dining area for Thursday Night Football, but while waiting I was able to snag a bar booth instead.  It's a great atmosphere and you get waited on just like you are in the dining area, but you get the noise and fun of the bar.   They serve regular American fare such as wings, burgers, pizzas.  I think their deep dish pizzas are just ok, it's nothing like Chicago deep dishes, the bread is thick, but it's pretty full of air.  Not a dense tasty deep dish.  But the other dishes I really enjoyed like their wings and salad.  They have great quantity as well so you will be full. They are also famous for their pizookie desserts.  It's a mini-pizza pan, but filled with cookie and topped with ice cream.  I would definitely try this, it's good to share and it's really tasty and well cooked. Service was really nice and we were even alerted of happy hour deals when we didn't know it was even happy hour time!  Happy with the portions and taste of most items, the deep dish pizza could improve, but I still like the experience you get at a BJ's.  Their craft beers are great too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=80

For what it is, BJ's brewery is a solid lunch/dinner spot, but definitely not a huuuge favorite of mine by any means. I've been to both the Westwood UCLA and Huntington Main St. location one time each, and the Tustin Marketplace location 3-4 times. But to me that's not very many occasions at all having lived around many of them for the past 6 years!  My one complaint about food would be that I wish the pizza could be saucier. That might be preferential, but the last time I went, I felt like our 'BJ's favorite' was overloaded with all the toppings,  but terribly dough-ey. I doubt that is a trademark of deep dish but could be wrong...so my thoughts on that are... find a pizza that can do both! Other menu thoughts are that the boneless wings are really good!

I enjoyed my soup in a bread bowl, and was pleasantly glad that the bread bowl wasn't stale or hard as a rock like I've had at another establishment in the distant past; in fact, it was delicious, and I only wish I didn't get full so quickly so that I could actually eat the bread bowl itself.

Rachel T.,"Irvine, CA",67,969,239,3.0,3/29/2016,"3.5  BJ's has always been the bomb since day one! I remember when my sister first started taking us there in the HB location and I thought it was the cats meow! I still feel that way especially since their menu is forever changing and evolving! Sometimes we'd have lunch at the HB location while in the area getting our nails done but now that she's moved to Irvine and we've moved out of state things are so different now :( I was in town for 2 days to see my sister and we came here on our last night and I couldn't believe how packed it was for a Wednesday night! OMG! Just about every table was filled and bigger parties were coming in by the droves! Luckily my sister walks extremely fast and was able to snag a table in the bar area LOL!  In the beginning the service was spotty, it took quite a bit to get menus and water, our server was slammed and was constantly on the go so I can only be upset at management not her because their wasn't enough employees. Once she was able to get us menus and drinks, we started with appetizers! Coming to BJ's is the best place for appetizers! They have so many to choose from, some to eat by yourself, some to share with your pals!  We started with: -Bone in chicken wings (we like ours with sauce on the side so we can enjoy the wing on its own and dunk our own sauces on it) Their wings are always on point, I've never had a bad order of wings, their always crispy and never soggy! -Potstickers: These are my go to! I wish they gave you more! We can easily sniff these up! Their always delicious and the dipping sauce is great too!  -Cup of clam chowder: The chowder is nice and creamy, not too watered down, I wish it had more potatoes but other than this is a solid choice everytime! Down to the entrées LOL My mom and sister both went for burgers and I tried one of their new Piadianas and was kind of disappointed :/ In the picture they look super ooey gooey and cheesy! However without any kind of sauce it is really dry, and the cheese was melted properly so it was kind of thick and coagulated :/  Other than that everything else was just delicious! Service got better throughout the night and my sister took home a Cookies and Cream Pizookie! I was too full and sleepy to try it but she said it was delicious!

Jennifer H.,"Orange, CA",45,151,17,2.0,11/20/2016,"Overall, I guess it was mediocre. There's a few reasons why I deducted two stars. First reason is plates were dirty. And when I say dirty, I mean wet with dried up leftover pieces of food like an onion or something. Second reason, service was not exactly the best. I mean, the waitress herself seem nice enough but she wasn't such a great ""waitress"" if that makes sense. Maybe she was extremely busy, I don't know but her service was definitely lacking. And my final reason is the food was not hot. For appetizer, I ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms. This is a dish I've had many times before and usually it comes out so hot that I would burn myself. This time it came out room temperature, borderline cold. Same with the pizza but it was a bit better. Still not anywhere close to ""just got out of an oven"" hot, but it was still somewhat warm. Now if you're wondering why I didn't complain to the waitress, well she wasn't exactly around. Our appetizer came out and we had no small plates. Our pizza came out and we had no red peppers or cheese. We needed to ask for every single thing, that is if we can find her. The food itself is not bad though.

Regina O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1408,673,1940,4.0,3/25/2015,"I've always had good experiences at BJ's.  I usually go for their pizza's and pizookies.  On my most recent trip here, my boyfriend and I ordered their Spinach & Artichoke dip, their new Spicy Hawaiian Pizza--pineapples, jalepenos, roasted tomatoes & chicken and their Balsamic Chicken Entree. The spinach and artichoke dip was really good.  My only complaint is that they could've added more spinach to the dip and if it wasn't so runny.  The dip was really thin and I prefer my dips to be thicker.  Once we were done with the dip, my boyfriend asked our waitress for some salsa which she brought out for us with no problems or extra cost!  Great way to eat up all those left over chips hehe. The Spicy Hawaiian pizza was also pretty good.  I don't know what it was missing but it wasn't as delicious as we had imagined it to be.  I did like how the pineapples added some sweetness to the pizza while the jalepenos added spice.  It was a good twist of flavors but something was missing.  Maybe use ham or bacon instead of chicken?  I did like how thick the cheese was... you could literally pull and pull at it before it'd break apart.  The Balsamic chicken entree is one of my boyfriends favorite plates to get here.  We got it upon his request.  The chicken was tender and not dry at all.  The mashed potatoes was seasoned very well and I like how they added onion strings on top.  Everything just paired very well with each other and it's actually a pretty generous amount of food.   This place can get busy and happy hour is ONLY at the bar :/  Kind of a bummer because I hate waiting around at the bar for a table and I would rather eat my meals elsewhere.  I hope they change that in the near future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=100

The burgers were really greasy very old produce, the egg rolls were soggy The Salted Caramel Pizookie was not the size that you get in the restaurant and it was $7.50.  One of the burgers was not supposed to have cheese and there was grated cheese burned onto the bun.  The vegetables in the salad are old and wilted.  The french fries were cold they did not provide wedge fries they were both shoestring so the order was incorrect everything was so greasy the only thing we ate was the burger and that is just the meat we just wasted $65 McDonald's would have been Gourmet compared to this will never be eating again from this establishment!  So angry right now.   Update to my review:  my husband contacted the restaurant directly to put in a complaint spoke with Evan and Elin who were both very apologetic and handled the situation very professionally thank you to you both we were advised to contact GrubHub directly to deal with the issue and they credited our acct.

Jamie N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",632,520,3854,4.0,3/21/2015,"Okay, I know BJ's is a chain with guests packing the house nightly, but what I find most worthy is their selection of bottled beers. If you love Belgians, this may be the go-to spot you hate to admit going to, but the list is pretty legit. My brother is a fan of Belgian beers with Chimay Blue at the top of his list, but he often ventures into sours, trippels, dubbels, and IPAs. And believe it or not, BJs is also one of his favorite places for beers.  We decided to grab dinner and some beers. He got his Chimay Blue and I tried something new, a sour! I had Supplication recently and although I liked it, it was much more tart than I expected. Petrus Oud Bruin is a wonderful introduction to sours as the dark, caramel brown ale has a slight sour tang without being overwhelming. I totally dig sours now! Can't wait to try more :) For dinner, I wasn't very hungry, so I just got the usual bar fare and a salad. I rarely eat salad as a meal, but roasted beets has been a favorite recently. This one was superb and only $4! It's in the healthy section lol. Dried cranberries, sweet yellow beets, strawberry balsamic vinaigrette and arugula - I would love to have this again. And then I ordered wings. Theirs is drizzled with a buffalo ranch, but it's pretty sparse so it doesn't sog up the crunchy wings.  Bro got a burger sandwich or something with their famous potatoes wedges. It's a must have for him, the potato wedges haha. After finishing his Chimay, he also got Goose Island's Sofie, a Belgian-Style Saison (Farmhouse) Ale.  I used to come here for pizookies, but now I'm all about the beers. Impressive!

Bassel ..,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/2/2016,"I LOVED coming to BJ's with friends probably 2-3 times a month. Nothing beats being able to grab a pizza, a steak, pasta, or dessert at 1 in the morning. That was until yesterday..... I feel horrible leaving this review but feel compelled to. I got to the restaurant and was greeted and seated very quickly (so far so good).  I look over the menu and see the soup bowl made out of bread. Looked amazing. I didn't want the soup though so I ordered my normal tavern cut pizza along with a bread bowl.  The bread bowl was amazing (for now). The pizza, so-so. It's hit and miss for some reason but I always tend to come back anyways.  I eat up everything and get the tab.... $10 for a piece of bread?!? What on earth. My friend ordered the SOUP AND BREAD BOWL  for $9.50.  I asked the waitress why it was $10 for the bread she stated that it can't be discounted. Ok fair enough but why not charge me $9.50? AND WHERE IS MY SOUP...? That makes absolutely no sense. It's not even about the $10. I would have paid $30 for the bread if that was the cost of the bread. But don't charge me full price PLUS $.50 and then not tell me it's the same price as a full meal. Or at least give me my soup.  Just didn't make any sense.  Not sure if I will be returning honestly. It's sad because I truly do love BJ's. It's a great atmosphere with friendly people and close to home.

Erin M.,"Irvine, CA",149,62,14,1.0,4/13/2017,"Turned off by their lack of service and weird attitude. Our server got a little spunky towards my friend when she gave her an expired ID. She keeps both with her in case of emergencies and handed her the wrong one. Also, I requested no chicken on my Cobb salad, so at the end of the meal I simply asked politely if I could have a discount for the chicken since I didn't get it on my salad. I did get a tiny bit of bacon (but I could've held that, too). The manager then came by and said they don't have a way to do a discount on their computer system...so yeah...weird response and I just felt that I didn't matter as a customer. I think in this day and age, doing a tiny discount for people who don't eat meat or who do without some meat isn't a big issue. What if we was full vegetarian and wanted a Cobb salad? There's no way to ring it in without meat for a discounted price? That's a little confusing for everyone. I work in a restaurant part-time and take off $6 on salads and lunches without chicken, beef, and fish. If it's a corporate policy, I'd gladly like to speak to corporate.  Our food was okay. Hot appetizers didn't come out hot at all. Our first server took a break and our second server was really busy.  But he was polite. I enjoy going to BJ's when I sit at the bar- I feel like I get better service and it's faster. It's still a good place to get a cold beer and some good pizza.  *Side note- isn't it cheaper to order a plain cheese pizza rather than a pepperoni pizza?

We enjoyed the hot appetizers (Fried Asparagus, Stuffed Mushrooms and Spinach/Artichoke dip) with shots of beer (whereas I don't drink, I saw that my family enjoyed the samples.) The food arrived quick, smelled great and was freshly prepared. The main course was even better... entrees ordered included Veggie Quinoa, Deep Dish Pizza, Penne Pasta, Tacos and Portobello Burger. Each entree was prepared well, served hot and tasted awesome! The pasta was just a bit heavy with red tomato sauce. We pretty much finished all our food except a couple of slices of pizza (which will make a nice lunch for one of us.) A trip to BJ's is never complete without the final guilty pleasure...

Rabia A.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2017,"So my friend and I wanted to go to BJs after a very long day and knowing that this place is very crowded, we asked ahead of time to be informed that the wait was only 30 minutes. Because we love the food at bjs, we decided to wait. However, after roughly 40 minutes I asked again and they said we had to wait another 30 minutes. Angry and hungry we decided to go someplace else to eat but on our way there, about 10 minutes later, we got a text from bjs saying our table is ready. This has caused me to lose all respect for BJs and I urge people not to go to this restaurant especially on a busy night. Not only is the wait ridiculously long but the waiters do not know how to manage the wait times. Never going to this restaurant again. Waste of good food. The waiters are also incapable of serving food. They don't give out utensils or napkins and forget about the food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=60

We started stacking plates and they still weren't cleared until we were paying our bill. Our last visit the waiter was very nice but very slow and had too many tables so the service took forever... Both times we have come, the avocado egg rolls have been burnt, which is slightly disappointing; but they are still delicious. The pizza tonight was burnt as well and so was the balsamic chicken... maybe the food is spending too much time under the heat lamps while waiting for the servers and runners to take them to the table...?

Kate B.,"Irvine, CA",233,239,350,3.0,8/1/2016,"Thank you for the reply Howard (GM). We are back tonight: (Monday August 1st) and our server recommended the Barbacoa Chicken to my father this evening. I mentioned my experience last time to the waiter and he said this time should be better. We are anxious to try it again and intend to raise this review to a 5 star. Again, thank you for replying to me and I'll email you to let you know how it comes out this time.   Ok it came out kind of the same. Better but still could be improved.  I've attached pictures of the pizookie and how thin it is. It's not even an inch thick anymore. I remember when they filled the tin to the top. It's covered in ice cream, too much. I googled pictures from BJs website to show the drastic difference in the size of the cookie in the pizookie. Unfortunately, I don't feel any need to raise my review to 4 or 5 stars at this time.  (Previous Review) Bjs is a lot of fun. I like the style of the restaurant. It's spacious and has a cool industrial vibe. Inside is surprisingly quieter than the outdoor patio at this particular location. We almost ate outside to try to beat the wait and it echoed so badly out there that you couldn't hear yourself talk. It was filled with huge parties of almost 30 per party. Probably quieter on a less busy evening. We lucked out and the hostess just put us at the first open table inside that she saw. That was so nice.  We came in a few days ago and I ordered the quinoa with salmon. It was so good that I hyped my mom up on it and brought her back tonight. So I ordered her that and I decided to try the barbacoa chicken. It was served on a bed of brown rice with black beans, sprinkled feta, Greek yogurt creme sauce and cilantro. It came out looking like it had been under the heat lamp for about 5 minutes. The beans looked baked together and there wasn't enough Greek yogurt creme sauce so I requested more which made it a little better.  Thankfully my moms salmon lived up to my hype and she loved it.  We ordered the pizookie trio: blueberry lemon, salted caramel and chocolate chip for dessert. The ice cream overloaded the cookie a little too much for the miniature pizookies and made it real soggy. The pizookie cookies are a little on the thinner side. They would be awesome if they were as deep as bjs deep dish pizza. Service was a little slow tonight and food came out at different times but within 3 minutes of each other. but they were busy, that's understandable.  Salmon was a score. Pizzas are very good. I wouldn't order the barbacoa chicken again though unless it was a little better prepared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=60
Nathan L.,"Irvine, CA",37,1,1,1.0,4/5/2017,Worst take out service I've ever received. Ordered my large pizza at 6 pm and was told it would take 20-30 minutes. Sat and waited for another 30 minutes for my order and asked multiple times for an update and was ignored 3 times. Hostess then asked if there was a name change on the order AFTER she took my payment because she LOST my receipt with my name on it. Manager brought out my order after an hour and when I asked if he lost my pizza he said they were just running behind which was a lie because my pizza was cold. Got home and one slice of pizza wasn't even a BJ's favorite slice. Horrible customer service and communication. They never even apologized for the delay.

I love how you can basically sit anywhere an at least see the screens. It's a great place to watch sports games on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday. I've been here in the past and all I can remember is that the beer is actually pretty good and the pizza is pretty average. I came in the other night and did not order either. Instead, I ordered a flat bread pizza because it was later at night and it seemed like a lighter options. We had the Italian pizza with sausage and peppers. It was pretty average just like the deep dish. It wasn't packed on with toppings and had a lot of crust. I probably wouldn't get it again. The highlight of the night was the free pizookie. I got the monkey pizookie with vanilla ice cream. This was actually really good. Instead of a cookie, it was a cinnamon bun that was nice and moist. I loved every bite of it and would totally order it again. Lastly, I thought the service was excellent. Our server brought me back refills without me even asking.

We went back to the hostess and found a small crowd now. We were asked to sign in and had to wait several minutes for a table. I felt as if we should have just been given a table to begin with.

Melissa C.,"Long Beach, CA",13,114,182,2.0,12/21/2014,"1st... a positive - it's pretty cool they have happy hour during NFL games.  The California Club flatbread was $4 & tasted just like a club sandwich.  Perfect size for snacking. For $12 we got 2 Titos vodka drinks & the flatbread.  But it's really, really weird that they have a full bar & can't make a Moscow Mule.  It's a very popular drink right now.  I would totally understand not having copper mugs & serving it in a rocks glass.  But to actually say, ""Sorry we don't make those"" is really just weird.  So we settled on Vodka sodas - sadly the soda was flat.   No wonder this place didn't make it in Belmont Shore (Long Beach).  It has a very corporate, chain restaurant vibe which it so...well executed on the corporate, chain, blah vibe.  The service in the bar, we were at a table, was mediocre.  The server made zero conversation with us & barely cracked a smile when we joked with her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=220

We headed in because it's a chain place that we both enjoy and feel comfortable eating at pretty much anywhere we go. We were on a time crunch and picking something we knew was the best option for the night. There was a bit of a wait - 15 minutes, but we were seated in about 10. We let the waitress know that we were in a bit of a time crunch and she was extremely accommodating of it. She took our order right away and had the food out quickly. She even got us our bill right after she confirmed that our food was to our liking.  We had a great patio seat with lots of fans over head for the little bit of heat that was still sticking to the day before the sun completely set. The place was busy, but everyone was on their game and seemed to be handling the rush with ease and experience.  My honey chicken salad was amazingly fresh and delicious. Their homemade root beer is delish. Wish we had time to get a Pzookie, but it wasn't to be. Next go-round. Overall: A Great staff. Sit on the patio.

They all smiled, asked if we're okay, and answered our questions nicely. It's not my first time trying BJ's and my friends really loved their's. The only problems we had was that our food took so long including our check too. The waitress forgot to print us a new check since we asked her to split it in 2. But that's not much of a big deal.

No greeting Hi How are you....nothing. We sit down restaurant is pretty empty everyone's at the bar. We waited about 4 minutes to finally meet our server. The whole thing was a disaster.  Manager was gossiping alot with servers at one point my server was laughing away with her manager instead of getting me refill. I understand restaurants get busy and things take a while,  but it wasn't busy it was pretty empty in there. Our server didn't deliver any of our food to us.

Andrew C.,"Irvine, CA",297,2,2,1.0,5/23/2014,"I came here to watch the Super Bowl with a group of friends and the cheeseburger I ordered gave me food poisoning. That aspect of my experience can be forgiven.  What makes me  give this place one star is my experience with Howard, the general manager.  Howard is a complete jerk. I came in today to complain about my food poisoning, and was referred to Erin. Erin was very considerate and professional. He brought back his general manager however, who basically accused me of lying.  I told Howard that I had gotten sick the night of the super bowl, and that the next day I called in to complain. I told him that they referred me to human resources who told me they were going to send me a gift card for compensation. Upon waiting a few weeks and receiving nothing in the mail, I called back only to have an employee tell me they were going to personally send me a gift card. Again, i waited a few weeks and received nothing.  I happened to be in the area today, and decided to complain in person. Upon telling Howard my story, he questioned me as to the names of the HR person and the employee I talked to. Considering that this happened a while ago I couldn't remember. He then proceeded to say that my story ""didn't sound legitimate"". He asked me how much i wanted on the gift card in a manner that suggested I was being unreasonable. I told him ""however much"". He replied by saying ""since the burger you ordered is only $10 I think that's how much you should be compensated"" I chose not to call him out on his attitude considering I was with my little sister, but was very tempted to go off on him. not only was he unapologetic towards the fact that I had food poisoning and was forced to miss class for a week, but he was trying to make it seem like I was making stuff up just to get a gift card. He turned to Erin and said ""whatever just put $10 on the card and give it to him"". He then proceeded to walk away from me as if I had just wasted his time.  I want to make a point in this review that Erin displayed an exceptional attitude. Upon giving me the gift card, he made sure to thank me for my time and told me to have a good day. He was very polite and attentive.  It is beyond me how that douchebag of a general manager got hired to run this place. He is incompetent when it comes to customer service. $10 in no way makes up for the experience of getting food poisoned, being stuck in bed, and being forced to miss important class time. I will be sure to take my business elsewhere in the future to watch sporting events with my friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=220

The management actions were deplorable and the environment is not inviting or professional at all. They were not busy, yet the staff acted as if they could care less about returning guests.

Clara C.,"Irvine, CA",2017,776,2655,4.0,5/14/2015,"I always thought BJ's had good food, but what stops me from frequenting here is the wait time.  It takes a good 5-10 minutes for a waiter to take your drink order, then another 15-20 minutes for your food to come out.  If it's a busy night, you may have to wait a while just to be seated.  At this location at the Tustin/Irvine Marketplace, it gets busy quickly.   I love that BJ's has a huge menu: appetizers, entrees, salads/soups, desserts.  On top of that, their drink selection is pretty impressive.  Sometimes it doesn't help if you are indecisive..everything on the menu will start to sound awesome and you order too much food!  My favorite appetizer is the stuffed mushroom, although they added more items on their appetizer menu like the flatbread and carnitas fries.  My favorite entrees here include burgers and pizza.  I love their deep-dish pizza - so many great choices like Great White, Sweet Pig, and BBQ Chicken.  My fave salads include Thai Chicken Mango and Santa Fe (I love avocado!).  For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the famous pizookie.  Their newest on the menu is the smores peanut butter.  (Note: you cannot get this one in a mini/birthday size)  I tried red velvet, triple chocolate, and salted caramel, and I still prefer cookies and cream.  The previous three are VERY sweet. HAPPY HOUR: Mon-Fri 3p-7p and Sun-Thur 10p-close.  (Yes, they close late: midnight!) Their happy hour doesn't really work for me, but $5 martinis!  For this location's happy hour menu, see their website here:  The reason they get four stars is I received excellent customer service from Craig.  He was great with checking on our drinks and making sure we had everything we needed.  That particular visit I had an email coupon, and he had already applied it when he brought the check.  This really impressed me because most times the waiter makes me wait another 20 minutes to correct the bill with their manager (sometimes it still comes out wrong), especially on my trips to BJ's. Tip: join the BJ's premier rewards program!  I get free food :)  Here is the link to their website ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=220

Told the waiter the correct soup. Brought it out after everyone finished. Friend 4: Ordered Totonka Stout. Never recieved it. Waitress didnt even put it on the receipt.

I've had reasonable to outstanding service, and when something just didn't come out right, the manager has turned it around.  I tend to favor the bison burger or the deep dish mini veggie pizza. I find the small is good enough to share so I've done that with a salad.  Keeps the costs and calories low. But they do have great burgers, pasta dishes, soups, combo plates and fantastic calamari.  If I'm drinking, I like the Berry Burst. I will say the Bloody Mary is a go-to.

This time I decided to try the Honey lime Scallops and unfortunately couldn't find anything positive about it.  Scallops were seared to the point they looked a bit burnt. Rice was bland. The asparagus were just old and chewy. After combining the sauce with the rice, it was more flavorful but the sauce was too peppery. To top it off, my strawberry lemonade was too sour and my free salted caramel pizookie (free if you sign up to their rewards) was toooo sweet. The ice cream was ok but the cookie portion was packed with sugar (and I have a sweet tooth too!!!)

I was in total shock when I saw my friends *TEARS* and very amazed how they all kept quiet for a WHOLE month! You guys are awesome!!! :D  Our party was sat out in the patio area with two long tables side by side. It was easy enough for me to migrate back and forth to each table to chit chat with my buddies. The service was amazing for us and they made sure that everyone placed their order, got their order, and came back to make sure if anyone needed anything else. They also gave me a pizookie for my birthday (: and was searching for my cake, but we were holding it already (haha).  Food I've ordered in the past:  Avocado Egg Rolls - so crunchy and tasty!!! Totally recommended!  BBQ Chicken pizza - delicious! great combo with the bbq sauce and chicken (they are known for their pizzas)  Mediterranen Pizza - very interesting and exotic type of pizza  Food we ordered on my birthday:  Pork Chops - the meat was so soft and the potatoes were so creamy and buttery  Jalapeno Burger - super yummy! if you are into jalapenos then this burger is for you! Calamari - super crunchy and the squid taste perfect!  Pizza  (others got many options) to share with each other) - usually very good!  Fettuccine Alfredo - my best guy friend said it was delicious  The Jambalaya Pasta - couple of friends ate this dish and they said they really enjoyed it  Drinks: Adios my friend - it is exactly what it sounds like! ahahah Buhh Byeee to meehhh! Island Sunset  - it is almost like another version of a Long Island (:   Overall, this is one of the top birthday events I ever had! Thanks Bj's, my boyfriend, and my friends for making this wonderful event happen!! :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=140

The pricing for a place like this was not out of line...I just expected a bit more food for what I paid.   The service was fine.  Food came out in a timely manner.  Server came to check on us routinely.   I probably would not come back here, unless I was meeting someone else for lunch.  It's not that the place was so bad, but more so that there were plenty of other restaurants around (some of which I've been to and had a much better experience).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=180

Jacqueline R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2491,927,2572,4.0,10/31/2013,"I had an INCREDIBLE experience when I dined here a few days ago! I've been to my fair share of BJ's locations, and they've all been pretty mediocre. However, I came to this location with my boyfriend this past weekend and had by far probably the best time I've ever had at a BJ's. It was pretty packed because it was the night of some local high school dance, and annoying super dressed up teenagers were all over the place in their 20+ people parties. I thought it was going to take us FOREVER to get seated, but it only took us five minutes (basically the whole time I spent using the bathroom LOL).  Then, the seating hostess originally took us to a table that's located in the back section of the restaurant that is in this echo-y, different room where they had basically seated all of the loud and obnoxious teenagers. As soon as I saw that we were being seated there, I felt uneasy and was already regretting it. Either me and the seating hostess had telepathy or she could just see the expression on my face, but she then asked us if we wanted to wait for a table inside, far away from the teenagers. We said yes, and she took us back inside and was able to find us another table to sit at which was MUCH better. Once we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our hostess who was very attentive and friendly. She took our orders and it literally took like...10 minutes to get all of our food. With the restaurant being super busy, my boyfriend and I was very surprised that our pizza came out speedily!  The only reason why I give this restaurant 4/5 stars is because we had ordered regular sized pizookies, and the ones we ended up getting were the small sized. However, we were not charged for the full size, so it was ok. Good job, BJ's! This might be my new favorite location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=180

The chicken alfredo was really bland and I had to add salt and pepper to it. The dishes pretty much balanced each other out. I had the Chocolate Chunk Pizookie with vanilla ice cream, which never disappoints! I love pizookies.

It was clearly less cooked than the previous peanut butter pizookie - much blonder- and needed probably 4 more minutes in the oven.  Not only did I not want to eat a plate full of cookie dough, but uncooked dough is a health hazard. It can cause salmonella in a normal healthy adult.

Azzy O.,"Orange, CA",157,106,17,2.0,10/3/2015,"I decided to not pay anymore patronage to the location at The Block due to horrible customer service and give this location a try after so many years.  First off, at 3:00PM it was very empty. There were booths available for at least 4 other groups of parties if needed. We were a party of 5 and a child and the hostess put us at a table w 4 chairs and where was my 2 yrs old to sit, on my lap? I asked for a booth so she won't fall or even get a highchair and she said she couldn't because there were so many reservations. As long as I remembered, there were only reservations a day ahead for parties of 8 or more. So I had to ask and she did confirm that you only need if there were parties of 8 or more and that's why we couldn't sit there. After we sat, she sat a bunch of parties of 2 or 3 people per empty booth. Why didn't her excuse as to why we couldn't get bigger table applied to them?  My point was that it's not about table or booth, it's about how she was seating other 2 or 3 people that had no reservations where she could easily sat us with a child. This is not our choice of place to eat but where my daughter loves the pizza so it's the initial reason why we are here. I also let one of the manager know and he truly apologized how she handled us.  Tip to hostess, when you see a child (offer highchair), someone disabled or elderly... try to make their visit comfortable. It's not difficult because it was pretty empty at the time. There are plenty of other places to eat nearby. I was just trying to make my child happy on her birthday for her favorite pizza and pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=200

Again, this is a complaint on their customer service. This complaint is about our service on October 17th, 2015, and it began at 6pm. My husband, 8-month old son, and I arrived at 6pm to meet up with my parents and brother. I told the hostess that there was a reservation at 6pm under my father's name; instead of checking to see if they were already seated, the hostess said, ""I'm not sure if they're here, but feel free to walk around and see if they are."" What?! You can't check to see if they're here?! I'M the one who's supposed to do YOUR job? Ridiculous! As it turns out, my family had not yet arrived at that point; but after they did arrive, the seating hostess sat us at the BUSIEST aisle, knowing that we had a child that required a high-chair (that had to be placed in this very busy aisle, which was by the kitchen). My son's chair was pushed as far in as possible (so that he wasn't in the way), and a bus boy STILL came rushing around the corner and collided into my son. My son got startled and started crying, of course, but I was glad that nothing had spilt on him (like hot food or a stack of plates). Right afterwards, a man named Chuck (I'm guessing he was the manager/supervisor) came up to our table and asked us if everything was okay. We told him that, for the future, it would be best not to seat parties with a child requiring a high chair in the busiest aisle of the restaurant. He apologized and asked if he could get us anything; since we were still eating our dinner, we said we were okay at the moment. We were going to stay for dessert, but everyone was upset about the service that we decided to get dessert somewhere else. When we got the check, we were shocked that we weren't comp'ed for a meal or given a discount. I was so upset that I just wanted to get the hell out of there. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! You're so lucky that my 8-month old kid didn't get hurt! I'm not so angry with the bus boy as I am with the hostess and manager. The bus boy was very apologetic, and I can tell he was very remorseful. But the seating hostess needs to do her job (and use common sense), and the manager needs to know how to handle these situations better.

Cindy Y.,"Boston, MA",577,333,878,4.0,9/5/2014,"When you walk into BJ's, you are greeted with absolutely beautiful decorations, with huge TV's mounted high up on the walls and that intimate ambiance. It's definitely a great place if you just want some drinks, dessert, or a nice dinner. Service is great and food arrives pretty promptly, despite the fact that they are so busy! I came here several times, mostly for pizookies, once for brunch, and several times for dinners. While most things are ""A-OK,"" what I definitely recommend are the pizookies and the pizzas! PIZOOKIES: they have a ton! There is a new one (salted caramel), white chocolate macadamian nut, cookies and cream, triple chocolate, smores, and the classic chocolate chip (also available gluten-free). Out of those ones, my favorite has got to be the white chocolate macadamian. It's actually the least sweet among all of them, and that works well, in my opinion. Since this is practically ice cream and cookie, you're going to get a lot of sweetness. When the cookie isn't too sweet, it provides just the right amount of chewy, yet delicious, goodness that melts your ice cream and delivers heaven to your taste buds. The macadamian nut is amazing, because you get white chocolate bits and macadamian nuts as you bite into it. Provides a nice crunch that is great! PIZZAS: what's special is that their crust is thick. They do it well. The crust is thick, yet so soft but crispy on the outside. It tastes absolutely amazing. My family and I got the White Pizza, which was great. The alfredo sauce really gave the pizza a nice creamy flavor that paired well with the tomatoes on it. The mushrooms were also absolutely tasty. I had a hard time trying to stop myself from finishing all of it so my family could have some. Overall, come here for the pizookies and pizzas! Haven't tried their drinks, but they look great. We also got the pastas, which weren't that great. Not much flavor to them, although the shrimp scampi definitely wins out over the chicken pasta. Whenever I'm craving that pizookie or thick crust pizza, I know where to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=200

It took a while just to get sides of sauces we asked for in the first place and had to remind him. But this wasn't what really upset us. Upon paying the bill we were 62 cents short (I held the tip for later) so my friend put in a dollar then I put in the tip money ($16) and he kept it all without giving us any change. We would have given it to him anyway but we saw him shove the money in his back pocket.

I don't think it took us over 5 minutes to get our order in. The food arrived for everyone else, but after they finished, our food still hadn't come out yet. I wasn't really hungry to begin with, I just didn't want to hold everyone else up because of our order so we decided to cancel it. We were by no means upset, but they tried to rush our order out anyway. In the end, they offered to comp our food which would have been fine if they cancelled it, but they also brought out the food! I felt really bad because I felt like they thought we were a charity case or some freeloaders. I won't lie, the food was really good, but it still didn't feel right. Anyway, I just felt like leaving a review saying thanks and I hope we didn't get anyone in trouble. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=200

Emily K.,"Chino Hills, CA",539,297,1721,3.0,10/1/2015,"Decided to come here on a whim for one of my friend's birthday tonight. Our friends arrived first and put our name down for a table, I wasn't there to witness this but she said that the hostess looked like she hated her life and was leaning over the counter on her elbow with the bottom of her palm on her forehead when she was asking how many was in our party. Meh, I'll let it slide, maybe she had a long day. We had a party of 7 and all ordered our own dish, everything was pretty whatever. My friends split a pizza and said it tasted like a pizza hut pizza and that it was super dry. The avocado egg rolls were bomb though and so was the appetizer platter but I felt it was a little too pricey for what it was, some mozzarella sticks, egg rolls, chips & dip and youre tryna charge me $17? bruh. But anyways, I ordered the cajun pasta which had a really good flavor to it. My only real complaint would be that a lot of the noodles were stuck together as if it'd been sitting for awhile or maybe not cooked properly? I also had a few of my friends' fries that came with his burger and they were soggy. The servers were very attentive though and came by pretty often to refill our waters and drinks. At the end after we gave the bill back to them, we told them to keep the change but they brought it back anyways? lol. The service was kinda all over the place today, everything was either hit or miss I guess. Probably won't be back just because the food is meh for how expensive it is, but I guess they do give pretty good portion sizes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=200

Richard J.,"South El Monte, CA",0,18,6,3.0,1/18/2016,"There are a few things that come to mind when thinking of a great place to dine.. One is obviously the food, this place has it.  Variety, mid-range meals, bargain meals and beer!  The other things are ambience/environment which it has a bit of as well.  The last thing is customer service/experience.  That is where this location falls short.   I've been a customer of several BJ's restaurant and this one for quite some time since I work nearby.  The wait staff is usually chipper but I always seem to get stuck with someone who isn't very nice.  I have a high tolerance for issue and not complaining because I'm considerate to things that may be out of their control but bad service is just that.. bad service.  My recent experience there was on a Monday night for the College Football Championship.  I arrived shortly after 5pm and grabbed an open booth at the bar, good enough to see multiple TVs and enough privacy for personal conversation.  Our waitress was a very good looking gal who seemed like she was in a rush when greeting me at the table.  I had obviously just sat down and without hesitation she asked me if I knew what I wanted to order.  I get that she may have asked for my drink order but I felt it odd that she asked if I wanted to order food without giving me a second to look at the menu.  I know I've been here multiple times but it was how she said it.  I then began to feel like she was rushing me because she knew that I was going to watch the game and most likely, she didn't feel that I would be ordering throughout the game, which I did do.   I was waiting for a friend so I was very patient when ordering my food/drinks in anticipation that my guest would be a few minutes behind.  Nonetheless, I ordered some wings, a personal pizza and a beer.  As my guest arrived he asked for menu and he simply did not get one.  After we both finished our drinks, she comes back and asks if he was ready to order.  similar to my experience, he felt rushed because she had not even left the menu the first time nor did she bring my water that I asked for several times.   All that to say, during the start of the 4th quarter of the game I was about to order a final beer when the waitress came over and said that she would be leaving for the day and before she was going to introduce us to our new waiter, she wanted to close out the tab/check.   Not knowing what to say, we agreed to close it out.  I know this was done because she wanted to cash out on the tip which she did deserve but that was definitely awkward and unprofessional in my opinion.  I ended up making a mistake about the tip and I over tipped because it was a split bill.  Just a disaster of an experience.  I'm sure that doesn't speak for the entire staff however, this isn't the first time I've been to this location and the service wasn't great.   BJ's I still love your chicken wings, don't hate me for my feedback ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=240

Sundos S.,"Santa Ana, CA",79,18,28,4.0,3/16/2014,"We love this place. Consistently great tasting food, always buzzing with a laid back vibe. We usually head towards the bar area for self seating and no wait. Same menu & sometime better service!  I've tried a variety of things here ranging from veggie jalapeño burgers to yummy happy hour finger food.  The winner of my BJ heart definitely goes to their Jambalaya plate. They are totally open to substitutions, since I don't eat meat they always don't mind giving me all shrimp rather than their trio of meat/shrimp. It's spices, balance of veggies/protein/carbs, and filling deliciousness is perfection. This time though, we decided to switch up our order and got the avocado egg rolls & stuffed mushroom appetizers along with a medium half buffalo chicken half vegetarian deep dish pizza. Wayyyy too much food for two people, definitely could have gone with the small pizza!  The avocado rolls were delicious, light and flavorful. Perfect appetizer, love the taste of the slightly warmed avocado in just the right amount of crispy. Sometimes, some food just makes you moan close your eyes and thank the heavens for good food. Those were the stuffed mushrooms for you. Little and delectable, the appetizer portion comes as six lil scrumptious mushrooms. Comes with a slice of lemon, we asked for more, squeeze em on for the most epic finishing touch to these guys. The pizza was good, the crust was phenomenal and so soft it was heaven in ma mouth. My vegetarian half came with roasted tomatoes, bell peppers, olives, and artichoke hearts (which I substituted for the onions). Good flavors, fresh ingredients, but for some reason I wasn't impressed. Good, but probably wouldn't order again. Overall great place to have a nice meal or have drinks and watch the game-we've never gone wrong here.

Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",583,1424,6055,3.0,5/16/2012,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is OK. I wouldn't consider it comfort food however, it's definitely consistent; you know what to expect and you know what you're getting. So, yesterday, when friends suggested meeting up here for dinner, there was no argument from me.  Lots of parking as it's in the Marketplace of Jamboree but know that there's a handful of restaurants nearby so though there's parking, you might have to walk a bit.  Service was pretty good last night. Our server (forget her name) was pretty attentive even with our party (6) being seated out on the patio. She was on the spot with refills with our adult beverages as well as not argumentative when we let her know that the appetizer plates were all dirty.  Food was OK. We all split a pizza, Jambalaya and some fish dish. Again, the food is OK. it's not great though it's definitely not fast food. This is a chain so like I mentioned, you know what to expect. The selection of beer seems to be growing from what I remember. As a fan of craft beer, I appreciate how there wasn't ads for the inexpensive, domestic beer that you can pick up anywhere. If I were just reviewing the brewhouse, my rating would be one star more, but for the most part, and in general, BJ's is OK in my book. Not my first, second or third choice of places to go - but I won't argue too hard if others want to meet up there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=240
Clare S.,"Irvine, CA",633,71,116,4.0,2/16/2015,"BJs is a pretty solid restaurant - impeccably clean, good quality food, decent service, and a great ambience. Only grip is that the service is kind of slow, and the wait can be long.  I used to always get the Steak Salad, but I'm sad to say that I don't think they have this anymore. So the last time I was here, I tried something new - the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon (see picture) over a bed of fluffy Israeli couscous, spinach and asparagus. I found this under the Enlightened section of the menu, so I expected something small and light since it was boasting a low calorie count. I was pleasantly surprised at how large the portion was. I could barely finish it! And I was delighted to find the dish to be VERY delicious and flavorful. I was ""mmm""ing at every bite, and baffled at how this could only be only 590 calories. Seasons 52 better watch out! I liked this salmon A WHOLE lot more than Seasons 52's low-calorie salmon dish (and needless to say, Season's 52 is also a lot more expensive, and the portion is smaller). I think I've found my go-to, guilt-free dish here... Also, I usually get beer, but this time I decided to try the Sparkling Raspberry Lemonade Mocktail (see pic). This was a tad too sweet, but still good. $3.50 felt especially worth it because of the unlimited refills. Next time I'll probably get another Mocktail instead of beer.  All in all, 4 stars. I won't be frequenting place TOO often cause it's a bit expensive for my taste (I can buy two meals elsewhere for the price of one here), but I'll definitely be back with friends in the next couple of months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=240

Even though the place was really busy, she was attentive and refilled our drinks and was always checking up on us. We found the Manager after our meal and told him that we had a great experience because of Jennifer. The food: I ordered the new Angel Hair Classico pasta with blackened chicken. It came out a little salty but it was still great. We also ordered the BJ's Favorite and Great White mini for $6 each (HH pricing). The best part is that we had just signed up for their rewards program and received a free pizzookie. If you download the app, you can order and pay your bill with your phone! I think this is a great idea especially if you have a big group and like to pay separately. You can also put your name down for a table and order with your phone so the food is ready when you get there. I'm hoping other restaurants will start doing the same thing.

Bestie and I hit up BJ's because we both felt like going no further than the Tustin/Irvine area for dinner, and neither of us felt inclined to go anywhere more interesting haha! Santa Fe Spring Rolls weren't bad, not superb. certainly I could do better at home, but they arrived quickly and were a share-able quantity for more than just the two of us. We managed just fine though thankyouverymuch! I opted for the vegetarian deep dish pizza. and a house salad. The salad was tasty, definitely more than iceberg lettuce on that generous plate. The pizza was more than a bit dry though, the olives were just barely warmed through, and the cheese was hardly even melted. Bland pizza isn't how I recall BJ's of meals past! Still, like I stated before, the service was on-par, so I'll give 'em another shot one of these days :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=280

Both delicious, one quick tip on the lettuce wraps, make sure you just add a little bit of the spice mustard, if not your eyes will get watery very quickly!

Service is always friendly, and food comes at a normal quickness. They have an expansive gluten-free menu as well. Their brews are exquisite and very fair-priced. Their Hopstorm IPA can rival most SoCal breweries. Not to mention, they also carry multiple guest beers on tap as well. Overall, I have never left BJ's unsatisfied.

Katie N.,"Irvine, CA",1,8,2,1.0,4/20/2014,"I've been coming to this BJ's for years and I've never experienced any major problems with service or food. In fact, I would have given 4 or 5 stars, but my visit two weeks ago was enough to knock all those stars off.  We came on a Tuesday night as a party of 12 for a birthday celebration. To start, we were nicely accommodated considering we had so many people arriving at different times and we hadn't made a reservation. We had a nice table on the patio outside, and we ordered drinks, appetizers, and food without a problem. We even got a complimentary pizookie for the birthday boy! Our servers were adequately attentive despite our party size and disorganization.  Everything was fine, and when the check came out, I was really happy with how the main server was working with us. She told me that we could write numbers next to each of our individual orders so she could split the master check into smaller checks to bring back for each of us. How nice was that?? The glaring problem began when one of my friends handed her credit card directly to our server to pay and never got it back. It was nearing closing time and we waited around for a bit, everyone got back their cards and signed off on their checks, and we were still missing one card.  We decided to ask our servers what was going on, and they were confused, as if they had never received that card. They went to look for it; the main waitress came back a couple of times to tell us she'd had no luck finding it.  Now, I understand that large parties can be more challenging to take care of. It was extremely kind of our server to even offer to split our bill with that numbering method. I understand that mistakes happen. But every time this server came back to our table to give us the bad news, she didn't seem apologetic in the least. In fact, she acted like it was one of our faults that the card couldn't be found. Maybe it was the fact that it was now well past closing and she wanted to clean up and go home, but her attitude was completely unprofessional. I was surprised that the manager didn't even come out to address such a big problem.  The waitress essentially told us to pay that portion of the bill because we hadn't given her the card, and that my friend could call back in the morning to see if it had turned up. Talk about a buzzkill for an otherwise good night! Oh yeah, and after my friend had already cancelled her card, BJ's found it the next day in one of the check books, just as she remembered giving it to our server. Maybe the waitress just wasn't in the mood to look very carefully that night.  I can't say I'll be coming back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=340

The kitchen staff was bringing the food out to the tables, and everyone around us was frustrated because of how slow and bad service was.

We ordered 3 of the 2 for $22 special which includes 2 soup or salads, 1 medium pizza, and 1 pizookie.  We got the lobster bisque, caesar salad, and clam chowder soups. The lobster bisque did not taste very good, and was definitely not a favorite to any of us. The caesar salad had pieces of brown lettuce all over in it, and it was drenched in salty caesar dressing. We were pretty disgusted at the lettuce. The clam chowder soup was the best out of the three, but it was very salty.  For the pizza, we got the Great White, BBQ Pizza, and half Buffalo/ half BJ's Favorite. The Great White pizza was very bland, I couldn't taste the alfredo sauce at all. Most of us didn't really like the Great White pizza and were disappointed. The BBQ pizza was very bland as well. The flavors were dull. The BJ's Favorite tasted just like a combination pizza from any place. The buffalo pizza was probably our favorite out of the four, although it was very salty. It was somewhat spicy, and had a ton of celery on top.  After, we got 3 pizookies - the peanut butter, cookies and cream, and salty caramel. I asked for the peanut butter smores pizookie, but the waitress brought out the peanut butter one, so I just kept it.  The best part of the meals were definitely the pizookies. Although they're really sweet, they were tasty.  The service of this place was horrible. We constantly asked them for water, more coffee, etc. but they did not come back for the longest time, forgetting what we asked for.

The gravy over it had plenty of flavor without being overwhelmed with salt. I had the sesame chicken salad. It was big, but small. Does that make sense? hm. It was too much for me anyway. The dressing was light and not overpowering the salad, and they let me sub lettuce for cabbage (not a raw cabbage fan). I only wish it had more oranges & bell pepper.

I've tried almost everything on the menu, but the pizzas and flatbreads will always be my favorite. Awesome spinach dip too. BJ's has a pretty decent happy hour. Half off mini pizzas and apps, a dollar off mixed drinks and two dollars off draft beers? Starts at ten.

She acted like she was Homeland Security, asking questions about how long he was staying in the country, what the purpose of his visit was, etc. Not at all appropriate. She was way out of line.

Normally, I like you for your delicious pizzas, yummy pizookies, and my guilt-free favorite, the Honey Crisper Chicken Salad. You made your honey mustard sauce my all time favorite sauce, and i recommend it to everyone.  Then. Today happened. I come in, I forget my camera at your table, and I call in to ask if anyone found it.  You don't. But...that's not right, I know for a fact it's on the table. Please check again. I get put on hold for 10 minutes. I call back again, I get transferred to 3 different people for a total amount of 20 minutes. You finally tell me...""I'm sorry ma'am. No one's seen it"". I'm heartbroken. I just bought that new Sony camera! Still, I drive 20 minutes to you to make sure, to double check, that my camera isn't lost forever.  When I arrive, I shamelessly ask the people occupying my former table to clear out, and i check under the table, around the seat. Finally, a manager tells me ""oh, here's your camera. One of the servers found it but left it on the front desk drawer...withOUT reporting it"".  So...if i didn't come back, I would've never known it was missing? Why wouldn't you report something worth $250+??? Were you planning to hide it in the drawer, then take it home later?  I'm sorry BJ's. That's really shady. I'm not sure if the honey mustard can still tempt me to come back.

Jami A.,"Irvine, CA",44,124,22,5.0,3/31/2015,BJ's is definitely one of my favorites. We always get the pizzas here. Either the bbq chicken or the mediterranean. They're mouthwatering! We just had the shrimp wrap appetizers recently and we loved them. I love their drink selection too. So many beer options for the bf and tons of cocktails for myself. My personal favorite is the raspberry lemon drop martini. And of course you have to get the pizzookie to top it all off (if you're not stuffed to the brim).

We proceeded to tell him that the meal came out incorrect and he rudely denied and walked away. We checked the menu on the way out to find that we were correct and the manager did not even know the menu correctly.

The funny thing is that we came for happy hour and ended up ordering nothing but a few beers from the menu. Their were some great food choices on there such as the flatbread or lettuce wraps but we just were not feeling it that day.  Always order their deep dish pizza. My favorites are the buffalo chicken, Mediterranean, and white.  For dessert, everyone is obsessed with their pazookie and did you know that you can mix two cookie flavors?

I am complaining about what happened next. They first asked the couple sitting at our table to move, but we told them that is not necessary. We were sat at another table. We then asked for our beers that they took and half the appetizer that was left on the dish. What they did later was totally disrespectful. They gave us half a beer each and they discounted half of the appetizer we were having without asking if we wanted another one. Maybe i was still hungry and wanted to finish the food. It was their mistake and they gave us half a beer which could be less than what i left in my glass.

From the wide variety of pizza topings available to the great low-key atmosphere, BJ's has it all. Plus, there beer selection is definitely worth trying out! They have some great brews for a fairly reasonable price. OF course let us not forget the best part about BJ's: Their Pizookie! This is an incredible taste of freshly baked cookie with cool ice cream on top.  It really is difficult to select a favorite at BJ's, either the pizza or pizookie! The price is pretty reasonable and a great place to catch up with friends. The food quality is always exceptional and I do enjoy their wide variety of food options available. The restaurant decor and atmosphere is relaxing. They have very comfortable booths for seating as well as several TV's for people to catch the local sports game and a full service bar.  The only downside to BJ's is the service. I have been to BJ's for several years and always loved and enjoyed the food and quality of it but the service was nothing more than average- especially if you have a large party, more times than not the service will be slow and take a while to fill requests.

Nothing to write home about. I do like that they have been working really hard to re-vamp their menu with healthier items. Even though I still order whatever I want, regardless of nutrition facts.

Will M.,"Santa Ana, CA",554,646,2470,3.0,10/25/2009,"We usually visit this place every month of two.  This latest trek was on a Friday afternoon at 1:30 PM. What a difference this place is when there aren't a boatload of teens and/or little kids jumping on the seats and proving how they can manipulate their parents in a public place. You can appreciate how nice the place looks.  They've got lots of big screen TV's, and is super crowded when there are big sports games or events. Some of the servers go home at that post noon rush time. So you may get much better service or not.  Inconsistency is one thing you'll often experience with BJs at this location.   I only live a few miles away, so this is a convenient place for me if I want some microbrew and a decent meal.  Ome of my favorite items here is the Asian Chicken Salad. They use Napa Cabbage, red cabbage, carrots, chicken slices and green onion all put together with a creamy sweet sour sesame dressing, and topped with a pile of fried noodles, I really like it, but it's $13 now, and at that price, it's not a great value IMO. Neither are sodas at $3 now. It's going to make tap water a better option.  Water is better for you anyway, and I'm finally beginning to eliminate the ordering of cokes or beverages.  But being a beer fan,I will keep ordering micro-brews on tap which I can't get at home very easily. BTW, in years past, Tustin's tap water was rated by some agencies are better than average. I also like the Balsamic Chicken also $13.  It's got two chicken breasts, a rich sweet balsamic vinegar served with greens and potatoes, though I asked and got white rice instead. This dish is filling.  There are lots of good chicken dishes, including fried chicken breast and the lettuce wrap appetizer. With a glass of one of their lighter beers, it's excellent. Some other favorites are the lunchtime meals with a half sandwich or pasta dish,  and soup or salad. There are other combinations are well for about $12 but it varies depending what you get. The star of this place is the deep dish pizza.  I know lots of people prefer the thinner crust crispier pizza.  But I like their deep dish crust so much I could just have that with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and a glass of merlot.  My favorite is the works, the $20 for large combination pizza with a little of everything on it.  We always order the large, and is perfect for 3 people.  With 2 people, you'll probably take some of it home.  The really talk up the pizookie, and it's good warm served with their porter beer or coffee.  They have a really good happy hour deals at 10 PM at night.  I once rented out one of my rooms to a fraternity guy at UC Irvine, and he and his friends used to go at least once a week for their great deals on a college budget.

BJ's offers a pretty large menu that can meet most people desired meal. The pizzas are big and made deep dish style. I think these are BJ's best menu item, besides the pizzokies of course. Everything else it good but not stellar. Average salads, pastas, steaks, etc. I do enjoy the large variety of soups though. The tomato basil is my fav. And last but not least the infamous pizzokies.

I recommend the chicken jambalaya and the cajun pasta -- both filled with flavor and well-cooked. Try the deep-dish pizza, as those are rare in Southern California.

The food is consistent with all other BJ's so I won't spend too much time reviewing the food.  I will note though, that 2 out of 3 visits here (when I actually ordered food instead of just getting drinks at the bar) I had some sort of misfortune.  First time (back when they still had the marina meatballs) they forgot to order it so it took 45 minutes for it to come out.  Second time the bartenders were changing shifts and forgot to order our spinach and artichoke dip so the new bartender had to re-order it for us.  On that same visit, there was hair in our pizza between the cheese and the sauce.  Granted, they took care of the spinach artichoke dip for us, but no love for the hair in our pizza?  Just a ""sorry about that.""  I wouldn't expect to them to take care of it since we ate most of the pizza before finding the hair, but at least a more genuine or sincere apology would've sufficed. Overall, if you've never been to a BJ's before and this is the only one within reach, I wouldn't stop you from coming here.  I would, however, suggest going to another location if you're looking for outstanding service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=300

We sat in the bar area because we were going to order off of the happy hour menu. After sitting for 5-10 minutes without any service, our server, Bonnie, finally came up to the table and very coldly asked us for our order with no smile or anything. She rarely came back to the table and each time she did, my sister and I were shocked at how rude she was.

Mary J.,"San Pedro, CA",39,23,3,2.0,10/23/2016,"We ordered delivery last night through grubhub (I already posted the same review through them too). We were in the area visiting friends and decided to order food to our hotel. Our kids had been running around all day and we knew they were too tired to be able to go out to eat and behave even moderately well. So, we ordered from BJs. I placed the order at 5:50 and the delivery time was showing 60-70 minutes. We didn't get our food until almost 8pm, after we called the restaurant and they flagged down their delivery guy. The order was incomplete and was missing an appetizer, the food was cold and it took 2 hours to get to us. The total order was over $130 for 4 adults and 2 kids meals. It was a pretty big let down and the added joy of hungry young kids crying for the hour it was late icing on the cake. I'm not sure if it's the restaurant or grubhub who employ the delivery drivers (or if it is the fault of the delivery person or the restaurant), but either way it's a representation of your brand and it was significantly lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=300

I've worked in customer service before and I know how you're supposed to act.

Jennifer Q.,"Tustin, CA",782,364,373,2.0,8/13/2014,"so ive been here a few times and finally decided to write a review on this location. for the most part i have had good experiences with staff and wait times, but during happy hour times at the self seating area there is trouble with getting servers to come check in on us and take our orders. i have had multiple good experiences with having huge groups coming here to eat and being seated promptly and taken care of but usually only with big groups. ill be honest i havent had the best experiences here but its not a terrible location. but lets get down to the important stuff... the food: -Cheese & Tomato Large Pizza ($15.25): thought because it was so simple it wouldnt be good but oh boy.... DELICIOUS highly recommend because the crust is delicious and everything else tastes so yummy on this!!! -Pizookie ($5.95): it was okay but i dont think these are worth the hype. i do prefer the chocolate flavor over the others and i mean if you are going to try this then get the chocolate flavor -Classic Burger ($8.95): thought i could not go wrong with a simple, basic burger but i had a weird tasting burger. the meat was flavored very strange and overall was not good... DONT GET IT -Spaghetti with Marinara Sauce ($9.95): TERRIBLE! im a sucker for basic marinara sauce pastas and this was the worst!! im not sure if its the sauce or just idk it was not good... DONT GET! -Happy Hour Sliders ($5): simple, delicious, and lives up to the standard slider. for five bucks you get three (i believe) simple sliders with cheese and a side of fries to go with it. i would get this again! overall.... if you crave BJs then go here but i prefer to head to different chain restaurants unless its for the happy hour or pizzas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=300

I notice the ones in the green apron are more assertive and attentive then the ones in the other apron. Why don't I just ask for a server in a green apron next time just to have good service.

I've frequented BJ's over the years and this was my first time at this location. The hostesses seemed very flustered and didn't even bother greeting us.  We ordered a deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. Our server had placed our plates on top of the stand for the pizza... Later, when a different server brought our pizza out she just stood there staring at us. We didn't realize that the plates were in her way. She could have asked us to move them but chose to stare at us until we got the point.  Our server's shift ended and he introduced us to our new server. She did not refill our water once and barely said 2 words to us. When she brought our check she dropped it on the table without even glancing in our direction.

Overlooked and they tasted like they were cooked in old oil. Root bear wings were decent but the celery was old, water loved and the tops of the stalk (who eats that?). Oh, and then came the pizza...complete with the hair. I couldn't take any more. I got up and walked out while the GM was trying to defend the horrible food.

Walter M.,"Oceanside, CA",1865,1608,606,3.0,7/10/2014,"Some companies get it and others don't. Some things are convenient and others not so much. As many of you know BJ's can be hit or miss in terms of wait/service. Case in point. I've literally come during a rush and been told 30 minute wait, driven to another BJ's 30 miles away and been seated and eating before my friends who I left there was. That's the kind of massive discrepancies you'll find at some BJ's. It's very area and time dependent. As an early adopter I'm all over online ordering, mobile apps and of course rewards programs. Chipotle gets it, easy, fast, quick to navigate, accurate, convenient. BJ's online ordering is the exact opposite. Their large menu is not intuitive, it's not fast, it's accurate, but when you pull up into curb side and call in, maybe they pick up, maybe they don't. Maybe the ticket on your foot says 21 minutes before pick up and maybe your food comes out 14 minutes late. Maybe you eventually come inside and see the dining room pretty empty. Who knows. I haven't and certainly don't have the time to track and document the rushes here, but I can tell you if you want to get back to work in a reasonable hour and think that curbside or ordering ahead will work. It will not. As with most BJ's the food is solid. You can't really complain as their menu selection is good and they have solid items and great beer pairings. It's not a sports bar despite their full bar and TV's and dark wood. It's not the cheesecake factory with their way too big a menu and lack of more salt of the earth items. My go to items are the avocado egg rolls and santa fe spring rolls, balance, bold and I like the avo cream sauce for both, when fresh are excellent appetizers, seared ahi tuna salad and a cocktail or craft beer. Don't expect too much local, but I'm a fan of their Tatonka stout. They have a very middle eastern seaboard brewing style across their in house offerings. Love the craft root beer, but too bad it's not free refills. Nothing is overly hopped (except Hopstorm), seasoned, roasted or IBU'd so it's a basic, but full offering. Service is ok, it's pretty good when you come here late or early, but in between, forget about it. Staff is very polite and usually apologetic so I generally sit at the bar for faster more attentive service. Classic dark wood, wall window ambiance. I dig the gluten free menu options and the small bites offerings. Spinach stuffed mushrooms have tons of flavor packed in single bite sized eats. Baked, not fried. Fried artichoke hearts with just lemon are just fine, no need for aioli aka mayonnaise. Don't get the mac and cheese, it's a kinds of failure. Something about the mixture of meats and cheese for a deep dish really separates the supreme pepperoni from the  veggie options. The classic is ideal for the sausage. It's maybe kinda close to the style they do in Chicago, but very corporatized. Burgers are ok, tons of fries, but it ain't no red robin, they need work. Higher heat, better meat mixture, the burgers are well put together. I prefer the pork chops over the steaks because honestly if it aint prime steak it's not worthy. The pork chops are almost never dry and it's a hearty meal. Spaghetti and meat sauce are pretty solid a backup when carb loading. Appetizers are pretty large in general and shareable which is why the small bites are so good for those who eat alone. Pizookie is excellent, even to go. A must try is the salted caramel with the extra caramel sauce. Literally this 1 item is the saving grace to an otherwise mediocre restaurant. I'll keep coming back for that alone, love the 3 pack, but a variety sampler of all would be great, sure you can do it on your own, but ordering is a pain online like this. They are open late so your ideal is for people who get out of work late or those looking to wind down with a nightcap, but more often than not the experience will keep them mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=300

Beth T.,"Irvine, CA",114,39,,2.0,7/4/2014,"I'm so frustrated with this place.  We've had extremely polarizing experiences here, but at the end of the day the issue is with the staff.  The management seems to need a complete overhaul and while some of the waitstaff is excellent, they seem to be constantly struggling.  My Family ate here on a thursday night about 3 weeks ago- It took us 2 hours to get through service without alcoholic beverages or appetizers. We waited *Forever* for our food and our waiter was so busy, he had no time to be apologetic.  We attempted to use the app for bill pay but something happened and we ended up waiting another 20 minutes for a bill.  Also, they screwed up 2 of the three orders.  The food was not bad, but the service was so deplorable that I said we would never go back.  Yesterday, at 3:00 however, my daughter *HAD* to have a pizookie, and since it was 3:00 on a thursday I figured they couldn't possibly be busy.  We were seated immediately- not welcomed, just how many and right this way. We took our seat, and about 10 minutes later (this is too long) a young man came to the table and told us that our waitress Stephanie was busy and he was helping her. We ordered our drinks and appetizers.  The drinks came almost immediately, the appetizer did not.  We sat and watched a group of staff next to the bar and a man in a blue button down and a tie have a fairly jovial conversation, and we continued to wait.  The Young man then came back telling us that Stephanie was still our waitress, however he was going to go ahead and take our orders (at that point isn't he our waiter?) we ordered and waited about 20 minutes for our food.  All said and done the meal took about an hour- which is fine, but I feel like a restaurant like this should have service down better.  This is where I really started to struggle, my child was tired of sitting and rolling around in the booth. I couldn't find the young man and I had seen a young woman with HUGE eyelashes one time (Maybe he was stephanie? if she was she didn't introduce herself?) She didn't want the pizookie anymore, but if she had we wouldn't have been able to order it because we SAT FROM 4 to ALMOST 430 WITH NO SERVICE. NOT EVEN A HOW WAS YOUR MEAL OR CAN WE CLEAR YOUR PLATES.  I FINALLY grabbed a young woman who was not our waitress and demanded our check, at which point she walked over to the man in the long sleeve blue shirt who brought our check and gave me the LEAST sincere apology I have ever experienced.  He told me he would take care of our check, I handed him cash and he walked away.  HE HANDED IT TO THE WAITRESS. HE DID NOT EVEN BOTHER TO RING IT OUT KNOWING THAT I WAS UNHAPPY.  Apparently his time is more valuable standing next to the bar and chatting with the staff.   This is my perceived experience, but any business owner should understand that to your customer perception is reality and in my humble opinion you have a huge attitude and staffing issue and those problems clearly start with your management.  You should take a lesson from the BJs in cupertino I've been there on a number of occasions and never once had an issue with the service.  This is disappointing since we live in Irvine, fairly close.  I will never eat here again and every time anyone brings up BJs this will be the story I tell them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=460

Jim A.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Just visited BJ's in Irvine, had terrible service at the bar (waited 40 minutes for spinach artichoke dip). Then I ordered a simple cheese pizza with extra sauce to take home to my family. Once I got home I found out I had a large cheese bread.  No sauce could be found anywhere.  How hard is it to make a cheese pizza with extra sauce? Extremely dissapointed in the food.

The service here is always awesome. We come here for a lot of birthdays and gatherings. I love the fried artichoke with extra lemons. They are not those big soggy ones you get from the jar. They have a light batter around them, with the lemon and dipped in a little of the sauce they are delicious. Another delicious apetizer and I think 150 calories is the fresh watermelon and feta salad. Refreshing and nutritious. The new handtossed pizza is delicious, I usually order it with pepperoni, mushroom, jalepeno. It's cooked to perfection. For desert the strawbery beignet is very good and sometimes I like the berry cobbler. I love hot cobbler with ice cream. Awesome location and great with large parties really amazing!

Sent it back to be told they would redo it straight away. After 20 minutes of waiting I cancelled the order as everyone else had finished and just asked for the bill.

You see a burnt pizza and think 'I bet they will love this'.?!??  You would think this place would be good for kids... But it is not. The waitstaff gave us dirty looks as they passed by our table and saw our toddler throwing it's nasty mac & cheese (that we bought for six dollars) all over the floor! I don't blame him for throwing the food... I wanted to do the same with mine! I guess it boils down to this... There are so many options around this location to choose from...

P B.,"Irvine, CA",143,12,67,1.0,4/5/2014,"Sorry for the novel, but I'm pretty upset. This was not my first visit to BJ's, but it may very well be my last.  Our party of 7 arrived at 5:10pm on a Saturday, and were promptly seated at 5:13. After we browsed the menu for 2 or 3 minutes, I was expecting our server to come by and introduce himself/herself to us and possibly offer to place our drink order. The dinner rush had not yet started, and I noticed that a group of servers were seated, chatting, at one of the empty tables on the other side of the patio. The diners that were seated around us were either eating or their food had just arrived, but none of those servers seemed to look in our direction. After waiting over 10 minutes, our server STILL had not come over...not even to tell us that he/she would be right back or to apologize for the wait! I was getting pretty impatient, so I decided to try to catch the eye of any servers/managers walking by. Finally, the hostess who had seated us saw my pointed stare and asked if we'd been helped yet. I replied, ""Not at all!"" And she promptly went to retrieve our server who had been MIA for so long.  By the time Jessica came to our table, I was able to give her our entire order (including drinks and appetizers), and the 4 kids in our party had finished the entire activity/coloring menu. She whisked our menus away, and promised to place our orders right away. I was starting to get pretty thirsty, so I was hoping she would bring our drinks out right away. We saw her come back to our area multiple times to check on her only other table, but every single time, she did not have anything for us. Tables that were seated AFTER us recieved their pitchers of beer, sodas, and even appetizers, while we were left to sit and watch as the other patrons finished up their meals and ordered dessert.  We did not receive our drinks until 5:45!! I have never been to any restaurant, whether busy or not, where I had to wait THIRTY MINUTES for mere tap water. It was ridiculous!! Jessica seemed very concerned about taking care of her other table however, and came to check up on them often! We did not get the same quality of service unfortunately, and when our food finally arrived (on her third trip to our table in an hour), she had accidentally ordered a kids chicken dinner instead of the kids chicken pasta. Our pizza was lukewarm and our fries were limp. Tables that had been seated after us had finished eating and had left. The dinner rush was now in full swing, and the hostesses were coming by to look at our table, probably wondering why we were still sitting there, taking up space. I let it go because I was starving, and we had a mediocre meal.  When it came time to pay for dinner, I had 3 gift cards. One had $50, one had $25, and one had $15. (I always write the gift amounts on the front of each card). Jessica came back with our bill and said the card with $25 had $25 on it, but the one that was supposed to have $15 only had $10, and the card with $50 had $0 left!! I was shocked, but she didn't bring me my 3 cards back so I can double check their card numbers against the balance slips she brought over. I asked another server to kindly return our gift cards with my writing on them, but she came back to our table saying Jessica said they were gone and they could give me 3 empty gift cards in return. Wow! Why do I need empty gift cards?  I sincerely hope Jessica was brand new, but because of tonight's ruined dinner, I have 799 Premier Rewards Points and I don't think I'm going to make it to 800.

Robert L.,"Foster City, CA",6,74,,2.0,5/31/2013,"BJ's is within walking distance from my house, but I never come here because... well, it's a chain sit-down American restaurant, which I normally avoid, they specialize in beer, which I don't drink, and they supposedly have great deep dish pizza, which I think is terrible. One random weekday night last week however, we couldn't find anything to eat that was open so we decided to give BJ's another try. It's hard to find something to order when everything on the menu has like 2000 calories, so eventually I ordered this weird bento-box thing that came with sliders, an avocado eggroll, salad, and fries (there was no calorie count on this item). It took 35 minutes to get my order! That must explain why my food was cold. The sliders were possibly the worst I've ever had -- the beef was super dry, overcooked, and there was no flavor or sauce of any kind. The fries would have been good had they been hot, but the avocado eggroll's skin tasted like tree bark. We did get a pizookie at the end which was decent and the reason I'm giving 2 stars, but not as good as I remembered.

George P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/4/2015,"We've been coming here since it opened and recently the food quality and delivery has been terrible.  Yesterday, one diner got fish and chips.  We couldn't find any fish within the breading.  Huge pieces of breading with no substance.  Plus, it arrived medium warm with cool wedge cut fries.  After waiting another five minutes the Southern Fried Chicken special arrived nicely hot, but the chicken breast was tiny.  The chicken in a Chik-fil-a sandwich would have been bigger and more satisfying.  BJ's used to have a great chicken marsala dish but deleted it from their menu.  Maybe we'll go back if they bring back chicken marsala.  Very disappointed.  Still hungry.

Trang B.,"Los Angeles, CA",263,175,190,3.0,5/14/2011,"Probably more of a 3.5, but the price is WAY too steep for what it is. Deep dish pizza--okay. I get mixed feelings about BJ's stuff. Sometimes, it comes out piping hot. Other times, slightly warm and very greasy. So overall, their pizza is just o-k, nothing to get too excited about. However, I do like the softness/fluffiness that deep dish brings. Try the Sweet Pig. Pastas: mediocre, really. Very basic, and no WOW factor. If you're gonna get something, the rotelli with cream sauce, grilled chicken, and broccoli is good. Chicken Parm is okay, too. Entrees: Chicken fried steak is my fave... But still not AMAZING. On their best nights, this is almost good. Drinks: strawberry lemonade is off and on. Sometimes, it's just a little too tart, and is hard to drink. Rootbeer float, delish. Beer sampler, always fun and probably the best part to BJ's. Dessert: WHITE CHOCOLATE MAC PIZOOKIE. No questions asked. Just do it. *Wait on a Friday night?

I asked for the salad to be chopped and he forgot. He was running around like a chicken with his head cutoff.  The servers here always seem to have too many tables and too much on their plate. The managers need to find a way to improve service at this location because it is just unacceptable very time we go.  Also, some things are overpriced.

Candice C.,"Newport Beach, CA",1427,177,1501,4.0,8/19/2010,"I've been coming to this location for 5 years. The hosting staff is always welcoming and accommodating, the servers are always on-point, helpful, and well-deserving of high gratuity, and the food is always served in a timely manner - and of course it's always delicious. When I was pregnant with my daughter (4yrs ago) I used to come here frequently for the deep dish pizza, and as I became a ""regular"" the staff started to note my habits, my regular orders, and were even more friendly and welcoming than usual - I loved that. It's always so nice to come in, and now that I come with my daughter it's nice to come in and see regular faces. My favorite dishes: - Avocado Egg Rolls - Chips & Salsa/Guacamole - BBQ Pizza - Buffalo Pizza - Asian Salad - BBQ Chopped Salad - BBQ Ribs - Oreo Pizookie - Oatmeal Raisin Pizookie Of course, during football season, or any type of sports season - this is the place to be. The bartenders are always on-point during game season, and I love that it doesn't get too rowdy here. Doesn't matter who the bartender is - they always make great martinis here. I've been to many other BJ's locations, but for some reason the bartenders here just do it right. I highly recommend having any of their specialties, or having a lemon drop, raspberry lemon drop, or dirty martini.

Hiep N.,"Irvine, CA",94,481,565,1.0,6/23/2012,"Bj's was good at one time but they have decided to reduce the level of service and the quality of the food preparation.  When we arrived on a Saturday night for dinner we were greeted by our waiter. We ordered water, the traditional wings for an appetizer, and the BJs Favorite Pizza without onions for our dinner. The wings arrived and they were great. We enjoyed them and neatly stacked our side plates onto the platter indicating we were finished. We assumed the plates would be cleared in a timely manner.    This is where the evening took a turn for the worst.  We waited and waited for our plated to be removed from the table. Our water glasses were empty, no one noticed or cared. Our waiter passed by our table 15 times and the empty platter full of chicken wing bones, and side plates remained uncleared. Finally, a busboy cleared our appetizer plates 25 minutes after we finished. This would be acceptable and tolerable if our waiter was busy or preoccupied. Instead our waiter was bantering with other coworkers.   After the busboy finally removed our plates we waited another 10 minutes for our BJ's Favorite Pizza to arrive. When it arrived it arrived cold and with onions. We kindly asked the waiter to re-heat the pizza. We waited an additional 15 minutes for our pizza to arrive and it arrived luke warm. We grabbed a slice for each of us. Then flagged down our waiter, explained it was still cold and requested that he box it to go.  The manager brought our to go box back to us and some what insulted my ethics. He stating the box of the pizza he was holding warm. I explained to him first of all the pizza arrived with onions when I ordered it without onions, and furthermore, the waiter removed the pizza from our table within 2 minutes of delivering it a second time with his bare hands. He didn't use the pot holders and that clearly indicated the pizza wasn't hot. The manager responded with the metal pan doesn't retain heat. His response was unprofessional and condescending.  I wouldn't return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=520

Vanessa H.,"Bakersfield, CA",297,987,78,3.0,2/6/2012,"Once again I break my No Chains Rule to review an establishment whose food, service, and overall experience is meant to be uniform no matter which location you enter. Normally BJ's is a 4-star kinda place for me; I'll admit it. Their pizza is deeelish, and the Great White is one of my favorites. They have a good selection of beer, including their own house brews, and are usually clean and well-kept. But because of my solidly 2-star experience over the weekend, I'm averaging it out to 3 for this review. We had a group reservation, with a preset menu, for 21 at 6:00 on Friday night. The idea was that our pre-ordered food would be ready AT 6:00, and we could begin eating immediately. At 6:00, however, the front of the house folks insisted that we needed more people in our party in order for us to be seated. I get that you'd need this for a regular reservation (and it's a long shot to think that all 21 people would be on time), but for a group event where the food should ALREADY be ready, I'm not sure what the point is of making people wait simply because we haven't met some imaginary quota. Well, come to find out that the food ISN'T ready, and won't be ready for another 30-45 minutes. This was irksome not only because it wasn't what we had signed up for, but because some of us had pre-paid the event organizer and needed to grab a bite and leave early (and it would have been even MORE irksome to pay for food that we didn't end up eating).

Normally it comes with just sour cream and butter but my servers always gladly gives me a generous free side of cheese and bacon. (2) Any of their burgers!!! their HUGE and totally worth the money and they come with those crispy thin cut fries that i love so much as well. One of the newer additions, BJs bacon cheeseburger is a new favorite of mine.  (3) Gourmet mac and cheese... I always loved mac and cheese so of course I always like to order this. 3 cheeses and bacon included with bread crumbs on top. Best of all, it's only 4 dollars... too good to be true.

My potato was definitely smaller than the ones from the Torrance location, but only by a little bit. Size does matter, even when it comes to potatoes. I've come to realize that the chili as a stand-alone meal/soup was probably not that good as it was a tad on the thin side, but as a topping on a baked tater, or on a burger (as I also saw on the menu), I think it's muy simpatico.

We usually order The Great White, which is a nice creamy Alfredo pizza with mushrooms, tomatoes and grilled chicken. My absolute favorite appetizer is the mini-Bruschetta. I don't even like tomatoes, but BJ's makes this dish so well.  Over the holidays, BJ's had a 2 for $20 special - 2 soups/salads, one medium pizza and one pizookie. We chose a half/half concoction for our pizza: The Great White & the Bacon Cheeseburger. Bacon Cheeseburger was surprisingly good. The only thing I would say is that it's a bit heavy compared to the rest of the pizzas at BJ's. Another time we went, we chose half/half of The Great White and the Buffalo Chicken. I have to say, this is now one of my favorite pizza combos ever. The Buffalo Chicken was so good - the pizza was drizzled with just the right amount of ranch and buffalo sauce (not overpowering at all), topped with diced celery and grilled chicken. The diced celery gave the pizza the perfect crunch and texture, I was in love from bite number 1.  As for appetizers, we've tried the clam chowder soup, the broccoli cheddar soup, tortilla soup and Caesar salad here. Everything is great, but soups are a little too salty. Tortilla soup is presented in an awesome way, with the toppings served in a bowl and soup poured over at the table. Pizookies are always great - my favorite remains the original chocolate chip cookie, but the Oreo and Triple Chocolate are yummy as well. If you ever need to take your pizookie to-go, let your server know and they'll have the kitchen bake your cookie in a tin pan for your convenience!

Thanks Bonnie for provided such great friendly personalized service! CON - As for the waits sometime it's so crowded it's not worth a 45+ wait so avoid it on the weekends and or if a major sporting event is on if you want to get in and out. Possible Suggestion for Management -maybe consider better weekday sun pm - thur pms happy hour prices and times.... You have tapas the new brewery coming and they will give you a run for the money if you don't do something to lower the wait times and your rewards program needs to lower their limits and or should include total bill price towards rewards.  Also your front doors should be adjusted to open easier for all guest.

I used to go to a place in the valley called Numero Uno.  My mother-in-law also got a regular salad.  It was almost all greens.

Happy hr: Mon-Fri 3-7pm & Sun-Thurs 10pm-close I ordered the Spinach & Artichoke dip. It was a happy hour portion so it wasn't too big but the ooey gooey of the warm cheese with spinach and artichoke was off the wall served with the colored tortilla chips.  Also got deep dish mini pizza and tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch (it's a new one) and I was anticipating a creamy ranch sauce but instead it was a little dry and very bread-y. But then again it was deep dish so what do I expect ... $6 for a mini pizza. Not that worth it in my opinion but originally it's 10.95 so it's a good deal.  Service was excellent. Server was really good about getting our drinks, order, and bill in a timely manner. I also really like the lighting of the place.

To be completely honest, the clam chowder was a little bit too salty for me and the caesar salad was just a little below average. The barbeque chicken pizza however was quite divine and equisite to my taste buds. The only thing that it lacked was a harder crust because it nearly fell apart the moment I tried holding it. The taste of the pizza made up for it even if I had to use a fork to eat it. And I got to say, BJ's definitely lives up to having the best pazookies! We ordered the cookies n cream one. The warm cookie melted in my mouth while the ice cream cooled it after. It was the perfect balance between warm and cool.

There is just enough room between each section for servers/customers to walk thru.  It was crowded when we were there, but not to a point where I felt penned in.  We had no one next to us for a while, and were conversing in girl chatter when a mother and daughter sat down next to us... dang, now I gotta watch my potty mouth!!!   Service was good.  We both got a beer (didn't really like the Heff) and the flat bread ""pizza"".  My friend got the black and blue which was loaded with goodies.  I got the club flatbread (chix/bacon/tomato)... and while it was good, there were far less on top than my friend's order.  I didn't make a fuss because a) I was hungry, and b) I figured it was fewer calories for me to run off the next day! Not wanting to indulge in one of the obnoxious pizookies (although the pizookie sampler looked good), we just got some vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup (not enough choc syrup in my opinion, but then again, I drink it right from the bottle!).  Again, the service was very good, and the communication was great.  I didn't like losing out server 1/2 way through the meal(mandatory breaks), but our replacement  was spankably yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=440

Daniel G.,"Irvine, CA",128,168,6,2.0,8/23/2013,"Been going to this place a few times. Primarily I come for the happy hour which equates to me ordering Beer and Pizza. Pizza is average. Its a thick slice (i.e. not the thin crust a la California pizza kitchen). The ingredients are average (typical of what you find in chain restaurants) and pizza is never too hot (i..e won't burn your tongue). So its a good option for parents and their kids maybe? I usually like getting the berry burst cider/beer combo drinks (1/2 cider + 1/2 beer, usually an amber ale). its a good option and probably one of my only reasons to really visit. parking is decent, despite being in a shopping plaza with other restaurants, this place always seems to be busy for dinner. There are times when I come with a group of friends and after finding ourselves stuck in a 30 minute wait, we usually opt to try to snag a table at the bar. This is good because we get seated sooner, but bad since they dont serve all your normal food they would to you, had they seated you at an actual table. but w'evs. the rest of the food here is mediocre. pastas are bland, salads taste processed and i really haven't had the courage to throw money away by trying anything else because really, how terrible must you be to mess up pizza and beer. Oh yeah, service can be hit and miss here, there are times when i literally had to take the bill up to the counter because for some reason or another, servers refused to pass by and take the bill. annoying. And then, another time my friend had crutches, and they completely forgot to bring them back to us, which was also kind of annoying, so we had to go and ask for them back. it would have been a convenience but turned into an inconvenience due to their lack of awareness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=440
Sally C.,"Santa Ana, CA",39,28,16,1.0,3/7/2013,":I I wanted to give this place a better rating. Be nice about the first time I came to this location. Well, the very first time they apparently messed up my pasta so they had to remake it. So the boyfriend and I waited for a very long time. They even forgot my bf's salad that came with what he ordered. I understood that it was busy and passed it off as nothing too bad. The waitress was very nice and did come check up on us. The reason why I am giving this location a 1 star rating is because of today's visit. We got seated at a table which seats four people, which I found weird, but understandable since there weren't many seats available. It all started to get bad near the end when we wanted boxes for our food. We waited for our server to come by so we could ask for a box. Tons of seats started to open up, people started leaving. Our server passed by us many times to attend to the one large table of people. All we wanted was a box and our check. I believe it took 20 - 30 minutes and she never even bothered with us. She had like 4 tables or less to take care of. We just wanted a box. Before the box deal my bf asked for a refill for me. She says she'll get me my refill then disappeared for a long while and then we had to flag her down to ask again.  What really bothered me was the boxes. It took 20 - 30 minutes to tell us they were out of large boxes. I just wanted to take home my potato. Another server had to box up the pizza for us and still I waited for them to find a box for me. They finally found a box and then we got our check after a few more minutes of waiting.  I was kind of irritated that she put our check in a cup. Uh, I doubt you ran out of those black check books. I didn't want to be pissy, but I was getting sleepy and tired of waiting for a box. She should have had someone deal with that simple task first if she was going to be busy with the ONE large table. The check in the cup, not sure if she was being a jerk to us by doing that. I just thought that was ridiculous. We didn't complain to her about anything, we just waited patiently for her to simply check up on us and she couldn't really even do that. I was treating my bf out tonight so I paid with cash. In like less than 2 minutes she had change and everything back to us. Really? You could do that in 2 minutes, but not grab us a box in even 10 minutes.

I haven't been to Bj's in years and I was pleasantly surprised with my dining experience. The restaurant is located in the Irvine Market Place and offers plenty of free parking. Our party of 8 was initially seated in the patio area but it felt like the heat lamps were on so we requested to move to an inside table.  The host of our party ordered the following appetizers:  (1) Best Beginnings® Appetizer Combo - $15.95  An assortment of four appetizers: spinach & artichoke dip served w/ multi-colored corn chips, mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls and Santa Fe spring rolls. Nothing spectacular and kinda pricey. 2.5 Stars  (2) Calamari - $8.95  Breaded calamari fried crisp and served with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli. Yummy!  3.5 Stars  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone as my entree for $11.95  2 Chicken breasts sauteed with garlic, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes in a lemon butter sauce. Served over angel hair pasta with baby spinach. My lunch entree was delicious because of the budda sauce.  The chicken was tender and savory and the pasta was cooked perfectly. 3,5 Stars  If you dine at BJ's for lunch (Mon - Fri.) turn to pg 12 of their menu and you'll find a page of entree deals!  The other orders from my party included: BJ's Mini One-Topping Pizza & Salad, Half Sandwich & Soup or Salad, Fish Tacos, and Handbreaded Chicken Parmigiana. All the lunch specials ranged in price from $7.00 - $9.00.  We had BJ's Triple Chocolate ($6.25) and Cookies & Cream ($5.95) Pizookies for dessert. Order these ahead of time because there was a wait until they were served. The wait was worth it!  I wish I had known about these pizookies because I would have ordered one as my lunch entree. Delish and sinful. 3.5 Stars. We received great service during lunch.  Our server constantly checked on us to ensure we had everything we needed.  The food is 3.5 Stars but the excellent services earns an additional .5 Stars = 4 Stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=440

I have been at this place waiting outside in the cold for over 45 minutes when they are slammed, I know quality and service at this place, that's why I have to give them this particular harsh review. THere are 2 things I like about my food, my food being fresh and I like asking questions about my food so that I can educate myself and the person who is waiting my table educates me, it is a give and take situation for me. I am very open minded and tolerant when it comes down to food, and since I have worked at waiting tables before, i know how difficult it could get.  During my last visit, I noticed it was not very busy, not a lot of people eat out on a tuesday night. I had a great date at the Laguna play house and I thought I would close the date by having dinner in a place I knew and introduce my date to something she had never experienced, that went sour really fast. It took a very long time to get our drinks ordered and since my date was new to the place and BJ's brews their own beer, I asked the waitress to explain the differences of beer to my date, the flat out answer was "" beer is just beer, just darker colors"". I felt offended and I thought about leaving inmediately and ask for a manager but my date asked me not to. Next thing, was ordering an apetizer, I love the avocado egg rolls here, but that night, they came with ice, that's correct, you read correct, the sliced carrots that came with my hot egg rolls had Ice in them, when I asked where the ice came from, I was told it came from the freezer.  I asked for my bill, got up and left. I ended up in tacos de anda in downtown santa ana that night eating burritos and drinking horchata and happy.

My only problem with this is that i've never had good service when i've come for happy hour.

I also asked for ranch and he completely forgot about it until I reminded him and he was like ""oh yeah you asked for that"".   The manager was going around some of the tables asking about dinner.

Teresa P.,"La Habra, CA",308,197,273,3.0,6/22/2010,"Went here for a birthday dinner. Birthday girl was expecting 20 people. We got seated at two parallel tables in the back of the restaurant. 11 people showed up at the reservation time. Birthday girl elected to hold off on ordering to see if some stragglers would show up. Our server repeatedly checked on her to see if she was ready to start. Finally, an hour later (in which only three more people had appeared), he told her that he wasn't going to start taking orders until she gave the go ahead. Thankfully, she finally gave the go ahead. I paged through that thick menu over and over. I never found the secret cheaper menu. I ordered the parmesan chicken and a side cup of clam chowder. Our server was very cordial, and took the time to answer my questions about the soup. He even moved closer to me so he could make sure he heard what I was saying. He even smiled and said he liked the parm chicken, and that he usually felt sleepy after eating it. I really really liked him. Unfortunately, a few minutes later, he introduced his replacement, since his shift was ending. (Remember, we waited for an hour before ordering, not his fault). His replacement was indifferent. She brought the food and not much else. I saw other servers milling around, including one guy who looked perpetually surprised. He was fun to watch, until I realized that he just always looks that way, and that there wasn't anything continually surprising him. One of the girls from the other table came over and sat with us for a while, bringing her drink with her. The restaurant is so loud, I couldn't hear what she was saying. I ended up watching dads bring wayward kids out to the back walkway to burn off energy. (BJ's really needs a PlayPlace at the back of the restaurant). The chowder came very quickly. It was tasty, thick and meaty. Not too salty. I couldn't identify what they'd used to thicken it, though. The parm chicken also came quickly - shortly after I'd finished the soup. It was better than I thought it would be: two big flattened chicken breasts with a crispy golden parmesan coating. Served with a paltry amount of broccoli and a nice mound of white cheddar mashed potatoes. The lemon butter sauce under the chicken was quite tasty. I liked it a lot, but there was too way little of it. There was also too little of the grated cheese and tomatoes. Parts of my chicken tasted just a bit off. I ordered a pizookie to go. Because of this, our server held my table's check. Once one of the guys finally convinced our server to bring the check, I noticed that the drink of the girl who had joined us had been added to our bill, while remaining on the other table's check. It was a big hassle to get it removed. Our server brought another server, who didn't want to deal with taking it off and said she wasn't authorized to take it off. Eventually it got taken off. I needed a to go box. Our new server took initiative and brought two boxes for the couple who'd ordered pizza. She bypassed me completely. It was like pulling teeth to get service out of her. The couple ended up up using one box, so the server gave me the other. The pizookie to go was packaged with the warm cookie in a bag, and the ice cream in a cup, separate from the cookie. In short, food's okay, with large portions. Service varies from pretty good to awesomely awful. Food comes out quickly at least.

The Pizookie is a fresh and warm baked cookie (white chocolate, macadamia nut, chocolate chip, etc.) topped with ice cream and served in a mini pizza style pan. BJ's Restaurants Inc. is credited for creating this mouthwatering dessert that most of us enjoy. Not to mention the fact that this restaurant and microbrewery chain (with over 130 locations nationwide) also creates some enticing entrees that makes me cringe as to whether I should be eating something with such high calorie content. The Irvine location is always packed in the late evenings because the city is such a quiet community, that everything closes before 10PM. I've never really had any issues with the service here, except that they do sometimes rush you since there's so much foot traffic waiting to be served. The only other problem is finding something to eat, meaning I categorize my decision based on - Should I eat something fattening or go with something healthy? And the word healthy in this case, isn't all that safe and sound as you think. HERE'S YOUR BJ * Pick your style of pizza (deep dish, flat bread, hand tossed, gluten free thin crust). They're known for creating some delectable pies and these are my favorites - California Club, Black & Bleu, Great White, and BJ's Favorite. * Appetizers - Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Avocado Egg Rolls. * Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich - Roasted turkey breast, tomatoes, avocado, Applewood smoked bacon, bleu cheese dressing, lettuce and Dijon mayonnaise. Served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll. Don't forget the pickles, potato wedges, and ranch dressing. * Fresh Atlantic Salmon - Flame Broiled or Blackened Salmon fillet served with Lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, rice pilaf, and steamed vegetables. * BJ's Brewhouse Blonde Shrimp - Lightly fried Panko Crusted butterflied shrimp (made with BJ's Brewhouse Blonde beer batter), served with thin fries, creamy coleslaw, house made tartar and cocktail sauces. BJ'S AWARD WINNING, HAND CRAFTED BEERS * LightSwitch Lager, Brewmaster's Reserve Blonde Lager, Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, Piranha Pale Ale, Hopstorm IPA, Jeremiah Red, Nutty Brewnette, P.M. Porter, Tatonka Stout, Brewmaster's Reserve Imperial Red Ale, Annual Grand Cru, Oasis Amber, Nit Wit, Oktoberfest, Pumpkin Ale, Field Day IPA, Pook's Pilsner. PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN For some strange reason, this dish always moonwalks onto my bill. Marinated chicken breast coated with Parmesan cheese and crunchy Panko bread crumbs, lightly pounded and pan fried till it's golden brown. Paired with white cheddar mashed potatoes, I add onion strings to replace the steamed broccoli. All topped with Lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and Parmesan cheese. It's what I commonly refer to as - THE GAME CHANGER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=560

Also the bartender kept brushing me off as if he didnt want to bother serving me and my wife. First and last experience for a restaraunt named after a wholesale supermarket.

Doesn't matter what it is either. I will stand by the idea that the under performing church on my street should be renovated into a BJ's immediately. We've been going to this BJ's in particular since we moved to California. The food is always good, the service is decent and the prices are okay for a trendy brew house. My favorites are the Cobb salad, the chicken strips and of course any of the pizzas.  The only things I don't care for is the parking situation and that it's always stupid busy (doesn't matter what time). Because of this I go the take out route once in a while.  It's interesting that they put a Lazy Dog Cafe in the same parking lot. I'm sure the people at BJ's were less than impressed, especially since it's half way decent.

Charlene P.,"Irvine, CA",102,146,192,3.0,8/1/2009,"I've been here so many times for birthdays/get-togethers/award ceremonies/going-away-parties/end-of-the-year-parties/socials/ice-breakers... But, I still don't know what the ""BJ"" in ""BJ's"" stands for. And, no. Not that. Anyways, what makes BJ's such a popular place for eating and meeting and mingling? I'd say it's the atmosphere over the food. Lights are always dim (Yard-House-esque) giving off that sophisticated feel, there's a fairly good amount of room between tables, good accommodations for large groups/parties, there's a bar available (it is a brewery, isn't it?), and, let's face it, these restaurants are EVERYWHERE! So, convenience comes to mind when I think of this place. So that's a good plus. But, as for the food... The last time I came here I had: Chips and Salsa -- DO NOT order this appetizer. The salsa's just too soupy and the chips tasted stale and way too salty. Save your tortilla chip cravings for Albatros. Mini Vegetarian Pizza -- A-OK. Not spectacular. If you're looking for a good selection of their deep dish pizzas, don't get the vegetarian. Try the buffalo chicken; trust me, it's a lot more flavorful. But, I guess for what it is, the veggie pizza here does fulfill its purpose and isn't too bad. It's a bit pricey though ($10 for a mini). Pizookie -- Tons of vanilla ice cream smacked on top of warm cookies of your choice (macadmia nut, oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, etc). I think it's pretty good the first bite, but if you eat too much, you'll fall into a food coma faster than when you ate the deep dish pizzas. The ice cream is kinda whack -- I don't think it's real. But, try it out for a cool treat, if not for the novelty of the idea. At least they give it free for your birthday (if you tell them it's your birthday)! I also had a few bites of other entrees/appetizers, but nothing here has yet to impress my taste buds besides maybe the Avocado Rolls and the Buffalo Chicken pizza. Definitely give those a try. I think that I'll never escape BJ's, just because it's so convenient. But if I had a choice, I'd save my $20. Oh, and service is all right.

Melanie F.,"Irvine, CA",15,14,,1.0,7/27/2011,"Wow- I have finally reached my breaking point with BJ's in Irvine. If I could give it negative stars I would.  We have dined here several times, and also ordered take out. AND every single time (with the exception of one time) the orders have been messed up.  Our last time was this past Sunday night at 5:30pm. We were seated promptly with no wait. We brought a bottle of wine with us, since they now offer a no corkage fee on the first bottle. We were greeted pretty quickly, and when I asked for a wine chiller for my white wine she said she would be back in a minute with one. Well, 5 minutes went by and she came back and said they were preparing it at the bar. At that point my husband order a beer. So the server promptly got his beer. When we asked about the wine chiller she now said that they didn't have any since the Restaurant only carries 2 wine chillers. WHAT? She just said they were preparing it?? Plus, what restaurant only carries two wine chillers? Obviously this one!  So, at this point I just asked for a wine glass and some ice. She said she would be back with both. She never brought either, but instead came back 10 minutes later to take our appetizer order. At this point I had been sitting there for 20 minutes with no drink and a warm bottle of white wine. So I asked AGAIN for the wine glass and ice. She eventually brought the glass but not the ice. Really? Is this rocket science? I gave up on the ice.  Then to top it off 40 minutes later the manager approached our table to tell us the server forgot to put our order in.....What?? At this point I really just wanted to leave, but decided since we were with my in laws to sit it out. Needless to say I will not be eating here again. This is the reason why I avoid chains. They lack service. They offered us free desserts, but in reality I have no problem paying for my food. I just want good service and a freaking wine chiller.  In past take out experiences, they have left out the dipping sauce for my calamari, left our dressing for salads etc.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else like Bandera in CDM or Nicks in Laguna.  They offer fantastic service, the same prices as BJ's, no corkage and plenty of wine chillers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=600

She forgot to place a food order for one guest all together which was delivered to the table after everyone else finished eating. She ignored multiple requests for drinks and water, then tried to make a joke and brought three waters to the one guest all at one time. This server took a desert order, forgot, again, and  asked if we wanted desert a second time describing the deserts, once morel until we reminded her that she had already taken the order. She then told us that she had just been crying in the back and described to us her personal issues she was dealing with as an excuse for poor service. This story even included a Murder!!...Really? All of this while she continued to admit her horrible service, laughing, uncomfortably. Another water was served in a dirty glass. The water tasted sweet, as if there were a drink previously served in the same glass... Yukkk!!.  At that point we asked for the manager who was less than apologetic. We started this evening asking for separate checks which also was forgotten by our server, who had to then take more time to separate our bills and comp our meals while we waited, when All we wanted to do was get the Hell out of there as fast as possible!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=600

Kaung K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",17,6,,4.0,6/25/2012,"So I got invited to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, Irvine to celebrate a friend's belated birthday.  (Yes, I have friends and yes, I get invited to parties!) Environment: What can you say, it's in Irvine and at the Irvine Market Place so it is a pretty busy neighborhood with many stores and restaurants nearby. Which is a good thing by the way. I mean you don't want to go to a restaurant that is at a quiet dark corner yonder, do you? I don't think so! You don't have to worry about parking space either because there is a huge lot. I cannot guarantee you will find a spot but since I went there at night around 10 PM, there were many open spaces. It might or might not be the same for peak hours or ""day hours"". Service:  The place is pretty packed even at that late hour! Both outside dining areas and inside are packed! I was just a ""visitor"" so the seat for us was already reserved (by walk in). I cannot really talk about the wait time to be seated (sorry!). But from what I've observed while waiting for my food to come, out of starvation but without hallucinations from hunger, I noticed new customers were seated fairly quickly. Even a large group of 10-13 got seated within at max 5 minutes. So, I guess not much of a wait time. (Again, keep in mind I'm talking about the late night hours). The waiters and waitresses are dressed in the BJ's nice uniforms; they all look formal more or less. I felt like eating at a high-class professional restaurant, except with some noises around from other tables. I mean what can I expect, right? Our orders were taken quickly and the waiter made sure we got everything we need by constantly checking up on us. Very nice staffs there! A waitress even helped put my leftover pizza I ordered larger size out of greed into a to-go box on my behalf! Thanks for that! Oh, the waiters (not sure about waitresses, and NO I am not checking out the guys - I don't swing that way) seem to have mood or Hawaiian or some sort of wrist bracelets. Maybe that's how they keep themselves all cheerful or how they cast yummy spells on the food they served! Who knows! It's a world full of wonders. Yup. Nobody said Thank You or Bye when I left though. I felt ignored. Somebody there owed me a hug! (Message me on here for preferences of the person who should give me a hug! Haha just kidding!) Food (Full Menu Here:  ): They have varieties of food and drinks. Here, I am just going to talk about what we ordered, especially me (no, not being conceited). You can check out their menu in the link I posted above though! Prices are aright for everyone and the food served can be shared too because it's a good size for a nice price! Wine & Beer: We ordered wine and beer. I don't know what kind because I don't drink much and I always let people order for me or jump into the easy bandwagon while ordering by saying ""Same as her/him"". But wine we ordered was pretty good and satisfying, so were the beer few others ordered. Pizza: or PIZZA!!! I ordered their new Gourmet Five Meats (Housemade meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, salami, Italian sausage and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.) pizza small size. Trust me, small is still big considering they have ""mini"" size below it! It came with about 5-6 slices; you can actually check how many slices each size is composed of on their menu, so you can have a good estimate. (Menu in the restaurant for sure, not sure about the online one). It was delicious!!! You can taste the mixture of everything. You know, sometimes the taste of meat and toppings did not sink into the crust/bread so it's like eating them separately. But BJ's pizza, mmmm mmmm!! Oh I think you can special order birthday cakes and have celebration too. Check with BJ's if you do need one! Noise: Just the usual noise you always hear at the restaurants with bars attached. But it is nowhere half as loud as Yard House though!!! (Or Dave & Buster's)!!! I'd say that's good. - Ko (Tweeper @KaungKo on Twitter)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=600

Chloe H.,"Tustin, CA",26,48,12,2.0,8/20/2015,"This review is based off of one bad experience I have had here. My friends were already seated and had a drink/food order placed before I got there (I was just joining them for a drink), the server came back around once I was seated and asked my friends how they were doing without even acknowledging a new person was at the table and I was sitting closest to the edge with no drink and an open menu (clue that maybe I want to order??) Well she started to walk away still without even acknowledging me! I had to flag her down and let her know I wanted to order, I understand she had a lot of tables but she didn't even let me speak before trying to walk away. Also once she walked away my friends mentioned she had quite the attitude which was very apparent! She had the attitude of she did not want to be working and was not trying to make our experience enjoyable. Before we were ready to leave we mentioned it to some woman who was walking around to tables (she was a fill in manager or from another location - cant remember exactly) and her solution was to offer us free dessert, which granted that was nice but we had said we were full and would pass, well she came around two more times trying to get us to take the free dessert! After multiple times of telling her no she finally brought the check and said she was sorry for our bad experience and that they had sent the server home (which they did - we saw her out in the parking lot). We were surprised she didn't comp anything off the bill as we didn't take the dessert.

I ordered their Jambalaya for dinner.  I have never been to Cajun country, so I can't compare BJ's to one from New Orleans but I can say it was the best Jambalaya I've ever had!  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, with just a bit of crispiness but mostly tender.  Of course, you can't go wrong with Andouille sausage and the chicken was blackened, which added a nice flavor.  The vegetables were cooked down into a delicious, spicy sauce but not so much so as to become indistinguishable one from the other.  The portion was generous enough that I took half home for lunch tomorrow. The servers were friendly and accommodating.  The atmosphere was fun.  I also had a great view of the football game.  All-in-all, it was a fair experience, so I'll likely go for more BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=580

What prompted me to post it after so long is the fact that this restaurant made me wait 45 minutes to process my payment, added back an item that was complimentary removed by the manager, and had the audacity to add gratuity after the server forgot to do so the first time he came by with the check. I went here for my close friend's 21st birthday party. This is by far the WORST dining experience I have regretfully not enjoyed. First of all, there was a hair in my avocado egg rolls. I politely told the sever, so they removed the item, and the manager brought out a new avocado egg roll. So that was perfectly fine. However, we asked to split the check for a party of 11. The server informed me they don't split checks for parties of 8 or more because it is ""easier for the servers."" I politely asked for it to still be split since I know it can be done. I waited 45 minutes for this split check to be done and charged. My boyfriend had to go to the hostess podium to request someone over to charge our checks. On top of all of this? The manager apparently charged the avocado egg rolls AGAIN after removing them on the previous check.

Chris E.,"Palo Alto, CA",38,10,9,2.0,8/21/2011,"We went for lunch this past Friday. I had the California Chicken Sandwich and it was yummy! So why the 2 star review? Because the service was crap. Crap I tell ya. The hostess was rude. And this wasn't isolated to us, I watched her interaction with everyone else that came in while we were waiting. ""Stand to the side"" got the same perplexed face from each guest she threw it at, but she's either socially clueless or just doesn't care because she used the same approach with everyone. And then there was our waitress. She was pleasant enough, but kinda clueless and definitely didn't care. I asked for one of the specialty drinks i saw on the sign in the entryway (the one we just waited in at the hand of the rude hostess). I remembered the ingredients but not the exact name. The waitress didn't know those drinks, which I suppose is forgivable, but instead of offering to go figure out which one I was talking about (there were only 3 on the sign) she just asked if I wanted something different. And then I ordered a salad instead of fries with my sandwich but it came out with fries. Also forgivable, except that the sandwich came out via a runner who quickly scurried off and the waitress didn't do the ""did everything come out ok? anything else I can get you?"" visit.

My party of 8 came early around 7 to wait for a table AND somebody called around 6:45 to get a call ahead seating.  We did NOT get a table until almost 8 and only reason we got food quickly is because we ordered food BEFORE we got seated.   Then after all this crazy wait, we were seated in their indoor/outdoor patio area where there was some kind of company/large gathering party going on.  Their patio area is pretty big and it can hold close to 100 people.  Well, there were more than  50 people SCREAMING and being very loud because they were drawing raffle for the group for the party.  I asked for a manager on duty and asked 1) if we could be relocated( answer was no because he told me that we will need to wait another 30+ minutes) and 2) if he could talk to the big party to turn down the volume little.  The manager keeps telling me that the large party will calm down as soon as Bizooki(sp?)  comes out.  He never said we will try to make the situation better or we will give you free customer service item, such as additional discount or dessert.  The manager did not know how to handle this kind of situation well.  How can he call himself a manager???

Also, they only gave us marinara sauce and two slices of lemon as condiments, and I was expecting a few more options (cocktail sauce would have been nice). In addition, the batter was kinda soggy and the calamari itself relatively flavorless. -Hawaiian mahi mahi from the ""enlightened menu"" (i.e. fewer calories): the fish itself was somewhat bland, but it was soft and the consistency was nice. Also, the flavor of the rice was able to balance out the fish, so I enjoyed this plate quite a bit.  -BBQ Chicken pizza: Didn't order this myself, but tried a slice and thought it was meh. Probably personal preference, but the lack of sauce and rather dry chicken didn't cut it for me. -Pizookie trio: white chocolate macadamia, red velvet, and chocolate chunk.

The extensive menu seems to cater more to quantity rather than quality and while the portions are large, I have not been impressed by the actual taste of my food. The drinks are the same way. When paying for a $12.00 drink, you would expect to be served a drink that contains some measurable amount of alcohol. The drinks I have ordered tasted weak and were far overpriced considering their quality. The service also seems to take longer to deliver drinks to the table than food. During my last visit to BJs, my table had to wait over twenty minutes to be served our first round of drinks. Considering a few in my party ordered bottled beer, this wait time seems ridiculous.

Kelly J.,"Irvine, CA",65,6,,2.0,10/22/2012,"We've been coming to this BJ's for several years now, once and awhile we had some bad service but overall things were good and it was one of the best BJ's we had been to. However, lately it seems like this place has gone down hill. The service has been consistently bad -- bad attitudes, long wait times, dirty tables and or silverware, and you're just kind of made to feel like you don't really matter and the staff is annoyed that they work there.  The food has been pretty bad the last few times also. We were just there on Saturday and I ordered the chili giant potato, when it came out it smelled kind of funky and then I found a long, tubular, weird thing in the potato that looked like it had grown inside. After I took it out there was hardly any actual potato left. You could also see where it started on the outside of the potato and looked like there was possibly dirt on all the gross part.. It was pretty much a rotten potato that they cut into and put chilli on top of... so gross!  After letting the server know, the manager came and was pretty patronizing and said oh you just saw a little black right? And was getting ready to explain how potatoes have dark marks, etc. No. It was straight up a rotten potato and I didn't even get an apology from him or anyone! They did take it off the bill and asked if I wanted something else, but no I wanted to barf after that. Can't believe that the cook would see that (he had to have seen it) and send it out, I could've gotten really sick and after thinking about it we had gotten sick the last time we ate there but thought it was something else.  I'm just blown away that I didn't get an apology and no one was even a little bit remorseful about the situation except for me for the fact that I went there. Also, my daughter's macaroni and cheese looked like it had been sitting out for awhile when it came (and it's not the first time it had come out like that) so just totally over this place and if I ever return it won't be for a very, very long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=480

Better yet, their executive chef who was responsible for the crust actually quit his job last week because corporate made this switch.   Those are the facts, I urge you to go try the new pizza.  Personally, I'm not going back until they go back to the old crust.  Until then, Selmas pizza it is!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=480
Kim N.,"Orange County, CA",64,83,238,5.0,3/20/2014,"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for happy hour on and off for the past year. Recently, we came across a very sweet waitress named Brittany. My boyfriend instantly liked her and I found that she was very attentive and good with customers. Today we witnessed something surprising and astonishing. We witnessed an act of kindness, something that I think is lacking in our society these days. My boyfriend and I entered the bar and found the last open table at about 6:05PM. A few moments later, a man came and looked around for an open table as well; there were none. He stood patiently against the wall and waited. Around the same time, Brittany had begun her shift and was walking around the tables introducing herself. Anyway, a table opened up about twenty minutes later; the man and another group from the other side of the bar got to the table at the same time. He generously gave the table up to them and went back to wait against the wall. I felt so bad for this guy and wanted hurry up and finish my meal so that I could give him our table but we were still waiting on some items to come out of the kitchen. Other waiters and employees walked back and forth, passing the man and ignoring him but Brittany noticed that he was still standing around and approached him. They talked for a minute and then she went to the front and had a few words with what looked like a manager. She came back to the man, directed him to the manager, and they sat him down in the main dining area. Brittany brought him the happy hour menu. Poor guy waited forty five minutes and made it just in time to order before happy hour was over. Props to Brittany for noticing him and helping him out. That was really awesome of her. My boyfriend and I were very moved by this and we honestly don't know if this happens often or not but we have never ever seen this take place before. I thought it was a really nice thing to do. Hell, it's almost midnight and I'm still shocked by the whole incident.  FOOD: I love the mini buffalo chicken deep dish pizza and my boyfriend is obsessed with the avocado egg rolls. A friend of mine always orders the potato skins. Mmm. Both the deep dish and egg rolls are $6 during happy hour. They have some good deals going on at that time. Happy hour takes place between 3PM - 7PM (which is why I like BJ's...I get off of work at 6PM and by then, most places no longer have happy hour) from Sunday to Thursday.

For instance, my girlfriend asked for Parmesan and ended up asking the hostess. How is that appropriate? Come on give me a damn break, Blow Jobs! How can you treat or let your servers commit to such atrocious behaviors? Maybe you should send them to server boot camp to actually hone their skills in serving customers properly not carelessly and idiotically.  Another instance, I was there with my grandparents for their 70th anniversary for dinner. Our server took forever to take our orders and drinks. This server had curly blonde hair. After 20 minutes, she finally takes our order and by then my grandparents were very irritated. When the food came, I was very happy until I found a curly pubic-like hair on my fries. I was absolutely disgusted and it ruined my dinner with my grandparents. I honestly cannot stand this location. Just passing by it makes me vomit. Please close down or fix your staff because it's extremely negative for your business.

Worst part is the dessert tasted like it had been sitting Ready to go for a while, and the ice cream was basically a puddle. And lastly you think if the manager is notified the guests service has gone wrong he would make an effort to come over and apologize or make sure we are okay, but nope instead he just comped the cheaper dessert and left us to pay the more expensive one.

Nothing has me salivating like BJ's chocolate chip pizookie. Nothing. This is my hands down favorite dessert because it is so simple, yet so delicious. I just wish they served it with a glass of milk. If you don't know what it is, it is a fresh out of the oven, warm, gooey, giant chocolate chip cookie, with a couple scoops of french vanilla ice cream.  The pizza here is pretty good too. Not Chicago style, but decent deep dish pizza. It is a little pricey though for what it is. It is a very light and fluffy pizza, rather than dense and thick. They charge a dollar for toppings on a mini pizza which is ridiculous. Because that's like 3 pepperonis, and 5 jalapenos for me.

Chris C.,"Washington, DC",627,473,249,4.0,2/4/2011,"I've been to about 5 or 6 different BJ's locations, and this one is my favorite. It's a little more spacious than some of the newer ones they've built, and they also have a really large indoor patio area that can seat really large groups for birthdays and other celebrations. I've been here with a group of 25 people before and we only took up maybe 1/4 of the patio.  I really like their house beer selection here, especially the Jeremiah Red and some of the other lighter ones. They have a beer sampler where you can try 8oz. glasses of four different beers in case you're not sure which one you'll like. As far as the food goes, I usually get one of their deep dish pizzas and end up splitting it with someone. It's probably the best deep dish pizza I've ever had at a chain restaurant. My two favorites are the great white and the buffalo chicken, which I think are two of their more popular ones. The fettucine alfredo is decent and so are their sandwiches, but I think the one thing BJ's does really well is the pizza. I also like the root beer floats! But the one thing that separates BJ's from the other similar chain restaurants in my opinion are their pizookies. An oversized, warm cookie with melted chocolate chips with scoops of ice cream piled on top...so delicious. I've come here just for dessert before just to have a pizookie, which is something I probably wouldn't do at almost any other restaurant.  The service is hit or miss here, but i've had more good experiences than bad ones.

Richard T.,"Irvine, CA",3,56,,4.0,5/28/2013,"I am not much of a fan for chain restaurant. BJ is a convenience since its only a mile from home. We do both take-out and dine-in. The food is good and the service is very good. The joint is professionally run including attentive service. The food is not greasy and my kids love it so I am a fan. My 8 and 10 year old sons love the spaghetti with meat sauce. The meat sauce is like catnip to them. For take-out we order the regular size spaghetti with extra meat sauce. I usually boil up extra noodles and mix it in with the extra sauce to feed both the boys. My kids are a fan of calarmari. BJ's calamari is fairly good but the portion is terribly small for even two young kids. When dining in, the child size spaghetti easily feeds each of them. My wife loves the mahi mahi with pineapple fried rice. Our first time experience with this dish included lots of pineapple. This made the dish very tasty. However, when we ordered the dish during our return trip, they sparingly added pineapple to the dish. This totally changed the dish and made it much less appealing.  Their deep dish pizzas remind me of the old Numero Uno pizzas. Thick and slightly sweet breaded type crust with a large variety of toppings to choose from. BJ's beers are bold in taste and also have a big bite to them which I am not particular to. No problem, they have a good selection of common commercial brands available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=680

We were seated at a visibly dirty table that had pools of fluid and crumbs on it.  The first server who came by put our drink napkins down into the mess.  When she took our drink orders we asked for someone to come clean the table.  The person who did was quick and efficient, and then put the same (now) dirty napkins down on the table.  The server who brought our drinks wasn't the same server who took our drink order.  The server who took our food order was different, too.  As was the server who brought out our soup.  As was the server who brought out our food and first delivered it to the wrong table.  Nobody came back to check on our meal after the food was down, which was particularly bothersome as nobody had brought us silverware.  I went and found someone to give us silverware and brought it back to the table myself.  The only server continuity we had was at the very end and she refreshed our long-empty drinks and brought us our bill. Only the very first server and the final server introduced themselves and it was overall a chaotic and confusing dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=680
Rick D.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,2.0,9/23/2012,"Two star rating only because the food and beer is passable. HOWEVER, you can have the best kitchen staff around, but if the servers are rude and incompetent, customers stay away. When we walked in the door to a mostly empty restaurant, 3 workers who I assume should have greeted us and sat us, were busy chatting among themselves, just pointed and said,""You can sit at the bar.""  When the bill came, we paid using a credit card, which the server ran twice. Once for my bill, and another time for someone else's. He could have apologized for the mistake, and I would have corrected it with my bank. Instead, he never said a word, smiled at us and accepted our generous tip. I had to find the extra charge in my bank statement. Food and beer is OK. Rude and dishonest wait staff.

Melody L.,"San Francisco, CA",36,517,104,4.0,2/6/2011,"You know, this is another bar restaurant, but I actually like this one. I think because they keep the bar area more separate, and give the same amount of focus to the restaurant area. They are definitely a lot more family friendly. When I've been here, I've gotten a sandwich, and the shrimp alfredo - both were really good. I've had their famed Pizookie too, and I can see why people are such a big fan of it. For me personally, I kind of start to panic when my ice cream is melting and I don't like cookies too much.. But BJ's is always a solid dining experience for me - I've never gotten any bad service. Except maybe the time they didn't return my 4 cents in change after I paid, but apparently a lot of restaurants do this. I don't know why, because it's still MY 4 cents, and if I wanted to leave it as a tip I would do so AFTER I get it back first!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=680

Karen V.,"Anaheim, CA",2,5,,2.0,10/28/2014,"We came here for dinner and to watch the world series while dining.  I will start out with what went well - the food.  It is consistent with other BJ restaurants that I have been to.  I will also give a shout out to the waitress that we ended up with Tierra (they changed servers after our drink order) - she is the only saving grace for the night.  She was a good waitress and had a pleasant personality and was the only person that made us feel welcome.  Why am I rating them a 2 stars?  First of all the greeters at the front desk - anything but friendly.  I wish I got their names....but they were 2 younger girls.  I hope they don't have aspirations to be much more in life  than where they are sitting - because their attitudes sucked!  They had sour faces when we came in.  All they did was take our name and hand us a buzzer - they are not even the ones to seat people!   I asked if we could sit outside at the patio - one of them said ""yes - if i can find a server for out there.""  Not sure what that meant..... because people were seated out there already.  We searched the bar area, but it was packed due to all the sports events that were taking place...... our name was called in about 10 minutes.  The greeter now informs me that she cant seat us at the patio because a party of 17 will be seated out there (yeah we get it - more $$ - whatever) and she cant accomodate us.   The seater now takes us to our table....which is near a busy walk path and UNDER NEATH the TV screen.   I told her we didnt want this table - the whole purpose was to SEE the TV while we dined.   She said ""i'm sorry.  Are you sure you dont want this table?  I will have to give it to someone else"".    I said ""No, I don't want it and secondly, dont say you are sorry, when I know darn well you could care less where you seat us."" We ended up fending for ourselves and grabbing a table in the bar area....barely.    The first waitress we had in the bar brought us our menus....didnt get her name though... when my boyfriend inquired about a specific kind of beer....she says ""all our beers are listed in our menu.""  - which is fine, we didn't expect her to list the names of everything on the menu - but it was the ATTITUDE and TONE that was conveyed.   if i could guess what she was thinking, it felt something like ""read the menu idiots, I don't have time for this.""  The next thing we knew - SHE wasn't our waitress anymore and our new server took care of us, which was fine.    She was the only person that was upbeat and positive and acted like she CARED. I don't mean to seem trivial and I am not a high maintenance customer - it really all boils down to the ATTITUDE that one person after the next  at this location conveyed while interacting with customers.   These were all primarly the Greeters and Seaters.   If they aren't friendly - who wants to continue with eating there? Service with a smile.  Treating everyone like they are welcomed and that you are happy to answer any questions or concerns..... not at this BJ's. They could care less what their customers want.  Just get them seated, served and out for the next person.    I will still go to Bj's - just not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=680
Sean C.,"Upland, CA",75,6,,3.0,3/19/2011,"I was initially gonna give this place 2 stars, but I reminded myself that BJ's is a chain and it's not their fault if they don't serve high quality food all the time. Keep in mind that this is just a review on the items that I had during my visit and is not a review of its entire menu. Pros: The wait staff was amazing. I know this is hard to believe for some people, but we were taken care pretty well by our waiter. We initially had 6 people in a booth, but several of our friends showed up and we managed to fit 10. Despite it being a busy friday night, our waiters helped us accommodate for our larger party size. I found this quite nice that they brought us more chairs and they didn't seem to mind that we were spilling into the aisles. Our glasses were kept full of water during our entire meal. The waiters were polite and timely with our orders and they accommodated with our several credit cards at the end (all of which is probably not new to most of you who have eaten at restaurant chains). Anyways, the real reason why we're here, the FOOD. Ok, honestly the best thing I had were the fries and they weren't even mine! I know you're probably just thinking ""it's only fries...."" but I'm very picky with my food and I love when the little things are done right. The fries were great because it had a great crisp and crunch on the outside and the taste of mash potatoes on the inside. Perfectly salted and great with or without ketchup. Now on to what I had for dinner, DO NOT get the jambalaya. If you're gonna go to BJ's just stick with their pizza! A little overpriced, but their pizza is definitely what they're known for (although that's not saying much). Anyways, my jambalaya was unbelievably salty! The spice level was good (I expect as much when ordering jambalaya), but everything else was either bland or salty. There was no flavor balance and that's what killed the dish. The amount of food was decent, but given that you're paying 15 bucks that's not saying much. I also had their pazookie for dessert. It was good, but honestly I think you can save yourself a couple bucks and make it yourself. Baking cookies and buying ice cream to put on top isn't very hard.

It's the go-to place for my cousins and I when we get together for holidays or have a break from school/jobs..  Anyway, we had a party of five and came to this Bjs for the lakers game 6 this past week, and had a great time. We came an hour early to grab seats at the bar before it got TOO crowded for the game. The bar was already full, but a nice lady had a few friends who canceled on her and offered us one of the two tables she was saving. Happy hour at Bjs is 4-7p, and wine is half off on Tuesdays...perfect! Half off mini-pizzas, two bucks off appetizers and a dollar off cocktails. We got some refillable sodas, the mediterrenean mini pizza (my FAV), southwestern mini pizza, mini pizookies, and a couple glasses of wine.  Service was great- waiter came by every ten minutes or so to check up on us even though the place was nasty packed. Our friend's pizza took a while to arrive, so it was comp'd. A tiny fly decided to go swimming in my wine glass halfway through, and they replaced that quickly. Refills came quick and food was delicious. Line was out the door, as hopeful late-birds waited for seats to open. I'm sure on a non-game day it's not as hectic, but I'd definitely come here again to take advantage of the happy hour menu :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=680

This visit to the BJ's in Irvine was very very disappointing, especially when I was here to have my good friend celebrate his birthday. It was all good until our food order was placed by our not so happy waitress. Usually BJ's waitress / waiter are super friendly and smiles a lot however this time she wasn't. We placed our drink order, 4 appetizer, and our 2 large entrees with 2 sides. We waited for a little bit of time and we got one of our side dishes the tomato capree salad first to share as an appetizer. After we waited for quite a bit of time ALL OF OUR FOOD came out at once which includes  all 4 large appetizer, 2 large entree dishes, including full rack of ribs with fries. Immediately I was very surprised how all of these came out at once. I am betting someone forgot to bring out our appetizer as all of the appetizer were cold. We had the calamari which seems it was friend twice and was not hot from the fryer. We ordered another round of drinks but it never came. So we asked for it again and still nothing.!!  The buffalo wings were cold like it's been sitting out for about 20-30min. Our California Club flat bread pizza was also cold where the cheese already started to harden. The full rack of ribs was cold and the outside skin was burnt where you taste more of the burnt skin and heavy BBQ sauce.  We were hungry and I was embarrassed to even tell my friend this a great restaurant where I often visit frequently. None the less we ate as much as we can bare. After we finished most of the food, we told the waiter it was our friends birthday so we got a free mini boozkie. This requires some time to make but NO ONE EVEN bothered to take our finished plates away. We sat there and chatted for over an hour and when the desert came our mini table was still filled with used dishes. The waiter didn't even bother to help clean up the table so we stacked 3 piles of plates. While the candle on the ice cream was melting. The waiter came back and took 2 of the pile and left the biggest pile of large plates on our table. He never came back for it, no one wished my friend a Happy Birthday, and we had to take pictures with piles of empty plates on our table. I wanted to say something but no attention was given to us. We dined for about 2 1/2 hour and I wanted to get my check but my waitress was no where to be found. Being the tech guy I am I paid over the BJ's APP and continue to sit and chat for another 30min. No one thanked us.  Honestly I am very disappointed with the service here, the quality of food is terrible and i'm questioning the temperature of the food to even meet health code standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=360

My go-to drink is the Jeremiah Red mixed with the Berry Burst Cider - affectionately known as the ""Jerry Burst"" - drink it, love it, and savor the smooth beer cider medley.  Also, my friends and I tried the new flatbread pizza appetizers - actually a decent choice and pretty light compared to their deep dish pizzas.   A pretty good happy hour outing if you ask me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=360

A friend and I had just done the Tap'n'Run in Santiago and decided that after running and drinking beer, we definitely needed some eating and drinking beer. I'd been here once before for happy hour, but that was on a weeknight and I couldn't remember if they did weekend HH. When we walked in (still dressed in our silly outfits from the run), the hostess looked at us and said ""two?"" and I answered ""Actually we were going to grab a seat at the bar if it's happy hour - is happy hour happening right now?"" to which she wandered away to ask someone else a question, then came back, picked up our menus and said ""No."" I followed up with ""Oh, ok, we weren't sure if you did Saturday happy hour."" Her response was ""we do, but it's not going on right now."" Uhhh, for one, it was 4 pm, so I would think if you were doing HH it'd be happening. Two, you aren't helpful if you don't tell me what time it happens so I can know for next time. Whatever. She just had that tone that made us not want to talk to her any more than absolutely necessary, so we let it go. Other than the less than stellar interaction with the hostess, everything was just fine - same as you would get at any other BJ's. Friendly service from our waiter, pizza came out as we ordered it and the beer is always good for a chain.

Syndie P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",101,21,12,4.0,6/1/2011,"Best place for gourmet pizza! I have been to this particular BJ's over a dozen of time's and I even had my baby shower at this location. What I find so neat is that they actually train their employees here and I have yet to get someone that hasn't been awesome. Happy hour is great here too if you don't mind sitting in the bar area and having appetizers. I was at this location once, sitting in the bar area, and this lady was with her husband. She obviously was mad at him for some reason and was hitting him every once in while, she even threw her drink on him once. She had way to much to drink at some point during that day, so the manager came over to try and handle the situation. At this point, the lady was out of control, yelling at everyone and demanding more drinks. So long story short, the manager sat with her and talked to her just to calm her down and he had also called a taxi for her since her husband had left her there. I thought the manager did an outstanding job as far has how he handled the situation. Bonus points there! Why do I always wait to talk about the food last? It's always the best part, right?! Their appetizers are all very good, try to check out one ever time you visit. Their specialty pizzas are the best though, the mediterranean one is my favorite by far. The more bizarre they seem, the better they taste so don't be afraid to branch out. They have a nice variety of food if you don't feel like pizza, so it's really a great place for everyone. I know by the end you are probably stuffed and will be getting a to go box, but you absolutely must try their pazooki for dessert. Those that are beer drinkers, the Jeremiah Red is delicious. They have a ton of beers and specialty drinks, so check them out! They also have a ton of tvs and are always playing the current sport events. Check this place out!

The toppings are always really fresh.  I go with tomato and mushrooms.  I also get a side of pepperoncinis!  If they are cooked on the pizza, they become really spicy.   My husband gets the shrimp tacos, he says they are fab (he also has a slice or two of my pizza, of course). I wouldn't recommend getting the mini.  It's too small for the ""deep dish effect.""  The toppings sort of fall to the middle.  Nah, I get a small or a medium so I can have plenty to take home and eat the next day.  It's wicked tasty warmed up in the microwave.    And the absolute best part, you can call your name in when you leave the house....when you get there, you will be seated immediately!  I love the dirty looks I get from the waiting customers.  Booyah!  It goes a little something like this:  ""Hey! ....What?...Are you kidding me?...We were here first!""  Or my personal favorite, both arms straight out, palms facing up, ""What the hell?!...How did they...?""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=660

This is the most economical way to go. The salads are more finely chopped with all the ingredients included.  The pizza is deep dish Chicago style with lots of toppings to choose from. My son loves the French Dip sandwich. A huge plus with BJs is their special deserts. The bazookie desert is what they are famous for.

It's $2 off the appetizers excluding the little plates like kettle chips and bruschetta. $1 off drinks. 1/2 off mini pizzas. The pints of beer are not expensive. They're like $5 each which is a pretty good deal in my book. For 3 people, we ordered 2 mini pizzas (buffalo and mediterranean), potato skins, and nachos. I'm not gonna lie, they were all pretty good. Except maybe the mediterranean pizza. It had olives, sundried tomatoes, feta, pepperoncinis, and chicken. The feta and sundried tomatoes made the pizza taste dry. The buffalo pizza was pretty bomb though. Great buffalo sauce flavor, chicken, celery. The nachos were huge and was topped with chili made with pale ale. The potato skins were pretty good too. I do like my skins crispier though. We paid about $10 each which is great but I don't know...

The dressing tasted bitter, and the ahi tasted as if it had been seasoned with steak seasoning. I was definitely disappointed, especially because the waitress raved that it was her favorite and their most popular salad. I HIGHLY doubt that. I love BJ's but I will never order this salad again.

I ended my night here helping a 6-year old little girl with a bleeding nose in the restroom. I couldn't find her parents and she refused to leave the restroom to find them with me. There's a time when it's good to be Miss Independent but not when you're 6-years-old AND with a bleeding nose, babygirl!  Anyway, so that was the bloody highlight of my night. Other than that, the food was just mediocre and of course, overpriced just like the many other American chained restaurants.  We started off with a flatbread pizza. The fresh basil with italian sausage sounded amazing but it was the biggest let down ever. I was able to count only 10 little booger sized ""sausages""  with watery tomatoes toppled on the ""flatbread"" with a pathetic amount of cheese. What saved the flatbread pizza was their Crispy Calamari. It went perfectly with the pitcher of beer the waiter recommended to us.  Onto main course: the Southwestern Deep Dish Pizza. It was supposedly one of BJ's favorites. To me, it did not taste anything special. The chicken was too dry and I could barely taste anything but random bursts of spice that wasn't too impressive. The whole time i was munching, i was craving for a BBQ Chicken Pizza from CPK! Then came the mouth watering dish titled Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta. Eh? The waiter claimed that was his favorite dish. Umm, does BJ's pay waiters commission now? I did not taste anything in the pasta but was quite impressed by how plumped, juicy and fresh looking frozen shrimps could be. I left stuffed however. 200% carboOVERload. If only I was signed up to run a marathon the next day, I'd feel slightly better. Overall, I have to give props to the waiter. He was quite attentive and quick with what we needed. Before I left, I went to check up on the little girl. She was still there pinching her nose.

I was going to take one star off because I don't actually think their beer selection is that fantastic, which is disappointing. I've tried all of them and found them rather boring.

The second time I went back, I went with a business partner and we sat in the restaurant.  We went early, so were seated immediately and I must say, I really like the relaxed atmosphere.  The lighting is really nice and it feels like a great place for a conversation.  I didn't notice this before, but they have the calories of everything listed on the menu.  I found this really depressing as everything worth ordering was chock full of calories.  I ended up ordering something that seemed reasonable calorie-wise, but I have to say I felt like it was not even worth going out once I saw how fattening all the food was and what my reasonable options were.  Anyway, waitress was nice enough but our food was not prepared as requested.  Some will say this is NOT the waitress' fault, but it is her job to check the food before bringing it out (I used to be a waitress) and she clearly did not as it was obvious the food was wrong.  My friend sent back his meal, but I kept mine as it was not that wrong and the kitchen was relatively slow in correcting their mistake.  There was the awkwardness choice of me eating my food while it was hot and then having to sit there with no food while he got his or just waiting for his food to come.  I chose to eat unnaturally slow so that I would have something left on my plate by the time his food came.  And then to be nice, I shared some of small meal with him so he could eat too.  When his food came, he offered to share, but I didn't like what he ordered, so I ended-up with half a meal that night. I was shocked that the waitress made no attempt to compensate us for the problem with our food.  I was expecting a free desert or something given how long it took for them to correct the problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=640

If you can find another restaurant, (which there are alot of in the surrounding area) please do so. If you are dying for BJ's, please go the extra mile and do not give this BJ's in Irvine your service.  I am not giving a poor review on BJ's because of their food, but on their service. BJ's in Irvine HAS TERRIBLE SERVICE. DO NOT GO HERE.Our waitress BRANDY was obviously having a terrible day and was not paying attention to our table at all and was throwing back all types of attitude during our entire stay. Never in all of our lives has a waitress thrown her finger at us to tell us to wait (really?). WE ARE NOT DOGS. WE ARE NOT CHILDREN. WE ARE CUSTOMERS, PLEASE HAVE SOME RESPECT. That immediately was an EARLY indication that the service here was poor. For the rest of our time here, she didn't look us in the eye when speaking and again, was throwing all types of attitude. REGARDLESS of the terrible service, my companions & I remained calm and cordial. She gave us the check and forgot the pizooki (really?) and we waited another 20+ minutes to order, get the check revised, and get dessert. Way before the dessert reached our table, my mood had already gotten sour.  We wanted to complain. All of my companions and I have worked in the food industry and have NEVER been treated like that nor have ever treated any of our customers like that in our life.A second waitress came, she was not too much of an improvement from Brandy. We asked for her name, and she just did not want to give it to us (really?). As we told her the situation from the previous waitress, it was so obvious that she was DESPERATE for us not to speak with the manager.  Regardless, we are calling management soon to let them know of the situation in hopes that another group of people just trying to eat a meal does not have to suffer the same crappy service we did.  I had higher expectations for this establishment and it let me down. BJ's in Irvine was a definite dissapointment. All I was trying to do was have a decent meal with companions in a chain I was familiar with.

The man who took my order seemed winded but still very friendly considering the time of night. I usually try and avoid ordering from places shortly before they close but tonight I got off work late and I was exhausted, suffering from sciatica and not in the mood to cook. I work in food service so I mostly understand what goes through the kitchen staffs mind when they see an order placed an hour before closing which is why I kept it simple. Mini deep dish cheese and tomato only. My usual. My boyfriend picked it up for me and when I opened the box, there was a black film under the cheese that was caked onto the top of the pizza bread. This has happened before and always late night. I had previously assumed it was just burnt cheese but considering this only happens late night, I was irritated. All I wanted was my pizza. I was starving so I still ate it but I had to peel back the cheese and peel off the film. I get it, it's late and the staff wants to get all their pre-closing done but come on! If this film on my pizza is a result of just wanting to get out on time I'm really disappointed in the way management runs the kitchen.

I have a love/hate relationship with Chicago style pizza. I hate it because you really can't call it pizza. Not in the same respect you call a flat style pizza pizza. Chicago style pizza is a sort of lasagna with pizza toppings and dough. You even have to cook it differently, so why still call it a pizza?   Why yes, I would like to order a Chicago style pizza. Please serve me a trough of round bread with a bunch of shit in it. Can you make it really fucking slimy and awful? Thanks in advance, Chicago. You're the greatest.  Chicago style pizza is the second most corrupt thing to ever come out of that city. Want proof? Well how about trying what we had this night at this fine Chicago style pizza establishment in the form of a Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza.  Yeah, you heard that right.. we tried the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza. Yeah, I'm confused by this decision. I mean.. it's for people who can't make up their mind on if they want a burger or a pizza.. and it's Chicago style so add in that you can't make up your mind on if you want a Lasagna either.  The burger was disturbing in the taste. I didn't get much bacon out of the flavor, so that was one misrepresentation right there. You can taste the ground beef and the pickles and cheese the most. Which I'm not sure is the greatest thing to want to taste on a pizza.  Service was pretty average and considering the large party we had, it was pretty attentive all things considered.  The beer is tasty and well, that cuts across all the BJ's board. When you consider that they aren't a bud or miller sort of company, the fact that they are making such good quality beer is a note worthy item.  Over all, it's probably the location most ""date nights"" end up for the folks who live in this suburban sprawl area and considering the alternatives to choose from in chains, it's one of the better choices.. even if the pizza is a pile of grossness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=620

When you've tried authentic Lou Malnatis in Chicago, this one will have to do in SoCal. The options are great and the servings here are pretty big. We ordered a mini to share with meatballs mushrooms and green peppers. They definitely loaded the pizza with meatballs. I like how their ""build your own"" come with fresh marinated tomatoes, If you like tomatoes this definitely adds that juicy bite to the pizza. I do have to say that our mini was more bready and airy than a deep dish should be, but it was less oily which was a plus. We also orders the nachos that came with no shortage of cheese and a surprise hot beans sauce on the bottom which was a nice compliment. To end, a gluten free pazookie was ordered. It came warm with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The first few bites were nice but once the ice cream starts melting you realize the cookie is way too sweet.

I come here pretty frequently, but never been here for happy hour, but all I hear are really good things.  During Fridays and the weekend you should try and call in because the place is extremely packed, with wait times going from 15 minutes to about an hour depending on your group size.  Good thing is, is that you can go to the bar and watch some sports and drink there while you wait.  Don't want to wait? well you can even eat at the bar if you want to.  Food and alcohol...can't go wrong. This place is known for their pizzas and their delicious pizookies (sp?).  I love the BBQ chicken pizza and their chicken fettuchini alfredo.  The pizza is perfectly made and the chicken not dry at all in both meals.  I love taking the bread they serve and dipping it in the alfredo sauce.  The sauce was rich and creamy but not too creamy.  Id recommend both meals for anyone.  O and you cant have a meal there without getting a pizooki, ice cream scoops on top of a freshly baked mega cookie.  This may be the greatest thing on the menu there.  Cookie is baked to perfection and the entire meal just melts in your mouth when you take a big bite.  SUPER DELICIOUS.  The beers are really good as well.  I personally like the jeremiah red and the tatonka which is very strong and rich, not recommended for people who enjoy drinking bud light or coors when other beer is available.  But for the most part their house beers are all pretty good. Everything is pretty pricey during regular meal hours, but i mean you are getting what you paid for.  The service here is pretty solid and most of them are extremely nice and talkative, making sure your meal is wonderful, except for one time the waiter must have been having a horrible day because he couldn't help making us think that throughout our meal.

Their rib eye steak was really good and their pizza flat bread is good too. Their signature pizza is deep dish but it is really tasty. They also have hand tossed but I have never ordered it. In my opinion their beer is only average and I have tried all of it. So I just order Stone's IPA, which they have on tap. You may like their beer but I'm a bit of a beer snob. The best dish on the menu is the by far the Jambalaya. Remember to order it half spicy unless you want your mouth on fire. I love spicy food and never order something half spicy but their Jambalaya is WAY TOO HOT. Order it half spicy and it is the best Jambalaya in Orange County. Whenever I go to a restaurant I always order Jambalaya if it is on the menu. So I have had it at half a dozen places and theirs is the best. Chaparosa Grill in the District in Tustin used to be the best but they closed. BJs has fair prices and you won't leave hungry.

So I've tried lots of other things on the menu...giant stuffed baked potato with chicken in Alfredo sauce, sandwiches, pasta, soup. Pretty much everything other than pizza.

When we walked into the waiting area, someone was serving sample pieces of pizza, which was pretty awesome. However, the service the rest of the night wasn't that great. Some of my complaints include: - There were different versions of the menu printed, so when I ordered a taster of 4 of their beers, the ones I got were different from what I was expecting (they took care of it, so it's not a huge deal, but still...) - We had to constantly ask for more plates/silverware because our waitress hadn't brought the proper amount out; she wasn't very quick about remedying the issue - My cousin ordered a kid's pizzookie for her son, which cost $1.95; all the adults wanted one of the same size; the waitress said they could do it, but they would each cost $2.95. What a farce! We get the same product as the kid, but we get charged more for it!? I've had good experiences with the BJ's chain before, so I don't want to knock it too much, but this particular location wasn't very good in terms of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=700

Ann M.,"Anaheim, CA",95,253,2,2.0,11/7/2012,"I've eaten at BJ's - this location in particular - multiple times, but felt compelled to finally write a review after my last two experiences, one of which was last night.  While I generally like BJ's food (don't come here for fine dining or anything exotic but for decent pizza and similar fare it's pretty good), my last two experiences have been disappointing.   About a month ago, my uncle and I came here for an early lunch.  Despite the fact that we were among the first to arrive for lunch at about 11am, service was slow from the get go.  Basically, the staff did not seem ready to start their day, let alone the impending lunch time rush.  They were slow to offer even basic services (appropriate place settings at the table, refilling drinks, getting the check, etc) but the food was OK and we managed to have a decent meal despite the lackluster service. Last night, my boyfriend and I came here for dinner because his mom sent us a giftcard.  Thankfully, the service was greatly improved from the last visit, but our pizza was awful (our appetizer and salads were ok).  When we were presented with the pizza, it was obviously a rush job done by somehow who didn't care and/or wasn't paying attention because it just looked messy - the toppings (pineapple and pepperoni) were not added in anywhere close to even amounts and the distribution was completely uneven.  Also, the pizza was little more than luke warm when it was served to us so it had obviously been left sitting and waiting because a pizza from the oven should at least be hot if served immediately.  Furthermore, upon biting into the pizza, we both wondered if any sauce was even on the pizza.  I pulled off my cheese and saw the tiniest bit of sauce in some of the crevices of the crust - it actually looked like someone put sauce on the dough and then wiped it off.   It was a disappointing visit and a waste of a gift card in my opinion.  I'm unsure if I'll come back to this location again due to the spotty service and food quality.  It's too bad because it's convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=700

During lunch it's much more relaxed.  Service: Never had a bad experience here. Friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Food: The pizza. I've had their burgers, pastas and a handful of other apps and entrees and they've all been tasty, but the pizza is something special, especially with the tomato topping. Definitely one of my favorites around town. Add to that a solid selection of beers (the house beers aren't bad either) and you're in for a good time. Oh, and l'm not really a dessert guy, but the pizookie is too good.

Heidi M.,"Irvine, CA",69,8,,3.0,3/20/2011,"Pizookie, pizookie, wherefore art thou pizookie? Man, I love those things. Have you ever had one? It's like heaven in a little dish. On the seventh day, God rested, and had a pizookie. I'm serious. I should probably tell ya'll what exactly a pizookie IS. Because chances are, if you're reading this, you have not been to BJ's and therefore have not had a pizookie. You have also not yet lived. A pizookie is a thick, hot, melted, chewy, cookie in a little pan with ice cream on top. I know, it sounds like any standard dessert, right? WRONG WRONG WRONG! I don't know what they do. I don't know WHY it is just so good. But it is. You can choose from Macadamia nut, chocolate chip, brownie, and oreo cookies, and chocolate or vanilla bean ice cream. They are all just so fantastic. I know it's just a cookie and ice cream, but I can't help but express my love in this overly extravagant form. My family and I shared a white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie pizookie with vanilla ice cream and a brownie cookie pizookie with chocolate ice cream. The cookies oozed chocolate and were perfectly hot and delicious, and the ice cream was creamy and complimented them perfectly. YUM. The restaurant in general, however, is pretty meh. It is a chain. It is known for its overpriced but fairly tasty pizza and beer. The service is actually quite fantastic; our waiter was super friendly and prompt with his service. Still, the food is pretty generic, and overall the restaurant itself is a little more buck than bang.  I ordered the Mozzarella Salad for my appetizer, which is this quaint little salad with lots of delicious mozzarella balls, tomato chunks, and thickened balsamic vinegar drizzled on top of a lettuce leaf. I love the firm, smooth texture of the cheese and how the tangy but sweet balsamic vinegar compliments it. The tomatoes also add to the tang, and the lettuce leaf gives it some crunch. I love this tiny salad, which is the perfect size for me, and it's only three dollars! As my entree I ordered the California Chicken sandwich, which consisted of lean, grilled chicken breast, tomato, avocado, garlic mayo, lettuce, and garlicky white bread. They were a little stingy with the chicken, which was also a bit bland; it could have been spiced a little better. There was a PERFECT amount of avocado, however, and its creamy nuttiness definitely saved the sandwich. The tomato and lettuce were fresh and crisp, and the mayo was a nice garlicky touch. And the bread was fantastic. They took white bread slices, toasted them, and added some butter and garlic, which really made it tasty. Overall, it was a decent, rather good sandwich, though at eleven dollars it was a tad pricey. Now, for the french fries. I love thin french fries, so I heartily enjoyed these. They were crispy, and I'm sure they were fried to death, but they were so tasty. A little ketchup and ranch, and I was in heaven. They were spiced well, so they were also delicious without any sauces. The menu itself is fairly limited to generic American food. The calorie contents are displayed on the menu, which I suppose is nice for calorie counters but the fact of the matter is that people don't go out to eat in order to watch their physiques. I found the calorie contents quite off- putting; it's hard to enjoy your food when you're worried about the damage you're doing to your butt. Do us a favor, BJ's, keep your caloric information available, but only upon request. It does not help you to have it right on your menu, especially since the numbers are HORRIFYING. I really should work out tonight..... All in all, BJ's is a solid place. It's not great, but not bad. And it's a wee bit overpriced, but you can't really avoid that if you're eating out. Go ahead and give it a go if you're near the Tustin Marketplace, which is a great location. Just try not to wince at the caloric information. Honestly, I think from now on I'm just going to go to order dessert, and I won't need to look at the menu to know what I want :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=700

Prices aren't bad during lunch and happy hour, but if you are here besides those time frames expect to be overcharged for an average beer.  There is nothing special about BJ's in general.

Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,3/4/2009,"Conveniently located near the Marketplace in Tustin/Irvine.  I think I am a bit jaded toward chain restaurants but BJ's has great beer.  As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes. Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But, in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer. As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heif  at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert. On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap, farmed, crappy, Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap, farmed, Atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful. The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But, the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too. They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that. This location is much bigger than some of the Oceanside locations. The service is pretty good. Some times its very busy but there is a lot of seating. I assume BJ's makes big bucks.

The food is good, and some of it, like the famed pizookie, is unique.  The shrimp lettuce wraps (new) are nice, and the beers are okay.  The fact that they are open later than surrounding businesses certainly helps also.

I also hate to sound like a broken record but their Pizookie is superb.  My favorite has to be the Peanut Butter one.  When you combine the saltiness of the PB cookie and ice-cream, that's just PMS heaven for any girl out there =)   Altogether, It's  a scaled down version of Yard House, but their Happy Hour is my 2nd favorite place to go.  Only thing is, it ends at 6.  Their girly drinks aren't as good as Yardhouse.  I would say it's more of a place to chill with your buddies to watch a game, whereas YH is a combination of both socializing with new people and/or hanging out with your buddies.  Wait time sucks anytime of the day.  You're better off stalking those who are seated at the booths in the bar area, and just staring them down until they leave.   Decent local spot, but don't drive more than 15 miles if that's what it takes to get there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=760

For dessert our friend got two Pizookies for his birthday and we all shared that.  I know this place is famous for it and everything, but you can technically make the same dessert at home.  Still good I supposed.  I was super full from the chicken! The main reason why this place is a 2 star place, it's the service here!  I wouldn't mind to give it an average rating, but I can't.  We made reservations that one person said we could do.  Another said we couldn't the first time we called to confirm and were told we had to call a half hour before.  Did that and came to the restaurant.  No table.  1 hour wait.  Finally got a table and then we ordered.  Food took forever to come out.  Then the bill took about 40 minutes to come!  Ridiculous.

Matt R.,"Orange County, CA",20,419,238,4.0,2/16/2012,"I rarely update my reviews and I am not a huge fan of reviewing chain restaurants, period, or chain restaurants. However, I recently moved within walking distance of this restaurant and have the opportunity to experience it on a different level, more often. They have a very good selection of beers on tap. While not huge, they have some decent microbrews, including their own, that most places just don't have. For example: I'm a huge fan of stouts and porters. If I am LUCKY a place MIGHT have Guinness on tap. They have a house porter and IMPERIAL stout (high alcohol content.)  They also have a red ale, which no one seems to do anymore. I guess there aren't enough Englishmen in OC to make it worth the while for most places. They do a happy hour on Sundays with pints around the $4.50 mark. Not bad at all. They do not, however, discount their appetizers during their Sunday HH. The food is ok. I liked the avocado egg rolls a lot. The avocado becomes very creamy and it comes with a sweet and sour sauce that goes very well. Their spinach artichoke dip is pretty good, but it's got a lot of cream cheese in it, almost to the point where it feels like filler. I hate, hate, hate the name 'pazookie'. Did a 7 year old come up with that name? Regardless, it's good. Cookies should be warm and covered with ice cream. I like that you can get three minis and mix and match. That was a fun way to try a few. Their cookies n cream was the best, being an Oreo based cookie. Their pizza still is not good. But, I hate deep dish pizza. I don't like eating a soggy pizza flavored, meat pie. If I want pizza, it should be crispy crust, whether thick or thin. Their menu is way, way too big. It's seriously a dozen pages. It's just tacky. Maybe if they had the bar and food menu separate it would be better, but I have to sit there and study a spiral bound menu for 15 minutes at the bar. I would say they have a 'little' of everything, but they kind of have a lot of everything. I can understand having a couple sandwiches, burgers, etc. Instead they have about 10 kinds of burgers, a dozen sandwiches, several steaks, multiple dinner salads, it's overwhelming and irritating for the customers. Service has been excellent here. The bar staff knows their beer and are friendly and prompt. One of the few places where they are good at letting the customer pace their meal, instead of either rushing them or disappearing for eternity. Their bar area is a little too crowded. The tables are stacked right next to each other with barely room to get in or out. I recommend sitting at the actual bar, if you are going to be in the bar area. Good, cheap beer and friendly service will keep me coming back. Overwhelming menu with average food will push me to other places, but keep BJs in the rotation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=780

I experienced something at the Marketplace BJ's that I've had happen to me at numerous Bj's, and that is my appetizer and entree came out at almost the same time.  Isn't an appetizer supposed to come out BEFORE the entree.  And in the case tonight, all we ordered was a salad and bowl of soup -- doesn't that take a couple of minutes to do?  But sure enough, after waiting for a little too long, the appetizers came and then a couple of minutes later so did the mini pizzas we ordered. While I love BJ's deep dish pizzas, mine was screwed up.  When I got the pizza I noticed a couple of slices of pepperoni on my pizza -- but not so much as to think it was a pepperoni pizza since I had ordered a tomato and cheese and the person I was with actually ordered a pepperoni pizza.  When I looked at the bill, indeed TWO pepperoni pizzas had been ordered.  So I'm not sure what I got because if that is all the pepperoni they put on a pizza it was laughable.  At the same time, I really didn't want pepperoni, just tomato and cheese. This is why I eat out less and cook at home more.  Why spend good money for mediocre food and so-so service.  Maybe if there were MANAGERs at these places that gave a damn the food and service would be worth while...

Today's order included Santa Fe Spring rolls which have a tiny kick and come w/avacado cream and a spicy Santa Fe dressing, chicken tenders w/bbq sauce, bbq pulled pork sliders (4 to an order), the bacon cheeseburger pizza and cobb salad.  My favorite today was the bbq pulled pork sliders...soft roll, tender pork, bbq sauce plus fried onions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=740
DOUGLAS K.,"Tustin, CA",0,31,4,1.0,1/22/2015,"Just got take out, order number 319153. I ordered a small classic combo pizza(sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms) and specifically entered a special request online for pizza to be well done and a small salad with Italian dressing(w/ carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, shaved Parmesan and croutons). Picked it up at take out counter and cashier confirmed my order, I agreed and he politely put it in a take out bag. I had to ask for a fork, napkins and Parmesan cheese packets. Isn't it just good service if he asked if I needed any of these instead of just handing me a bag and a receipt? Manager problem. Well, stupid me for trusting the cook and the cashier and not checking my order before I got home. I open up my salad and there are no carrots, tomatoes or cucumbers and very little lettuce. Oh well, I think, I'm hungry so I just ate it. Then, I open up my pizza and notice that half the pizza is just cheese, there is only one slice of pepperoni on the entire pizza with a few small mushroom slices and a few pieces of sausage on half of the pizza and it was not crispy nor cooked well done as I requested. Again, stupid me for trusting their competence and that they actually care about quality and a positive customer experience. Again, a Manager problem. So, I call BJs in Irvine and speak to a Manager named Chuck to reiterate my frustration and dissatisfaction as described above. Chuck immediately goes into his trained managerial corporate lingo and actually says,""Sounds like you got the wrong pizza."" Really Chuck? Monday night at 8:30pm? Really? How bout this Chuck? How bout you and the other corporate bean counter managers get out of your office and get your eyes on your kitchen and wait staff to confirm service and quality are consistently being delivered? Just a bunch of sense of entitlement HS and College kids who work here with no work ethic, not a clue on what customer service means, it's just a playtime workplace. And, really no difference in the Manager's competence. So, keep counting your beans, watch your sales and stock price continue to drop and try to figure why your customers are not returning. You won't, instead you'll just find a way to decrease the portions and quality and increase your prices. I'm done. Never again! America, Stay with your local owner operated businesses. Boycott the corporate restaurants! They only care about their profits, not your experience or value received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=740

Sher L.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",597,183,1534,1.0,4/25/2011,"A MUST READ!  You'll definitely regret booking a birthday party here.  I made reservations here for my bf's bday party.  We thought it would be a cool and fun atmosphere and good for all ages since my nephew and his friends were attending and some are just 21 years old and the rest of us are in our early 30's. I had to change the number of guests a few more times than expected as many of our guests weren't prompt with RSVP'ing on the E-vites. Every time I called in to make changes to the number of guests, the rep had to put me on hold for a long time just to get a manager there to verify the bday reservation.  So annoying!  They also told me that if I was over 15 minutes late, they would give my table away. Unbelievable!.. as I had 15 guests RSVP'ing thus far. When we got there, the place was seriously so packed with literally NO tables available.  It was so busy it made the economy look like it was booming again.  It had a really nice casual feel but way too loud.  The hostess walked us to the patio area where all the birthday reservations were held and I noticed that they broke up my party into two separate rows of 10 seats per table as if a cafeteria style.  I was like wtf! How could my guests enjoy each others company if we're all broken up?  So I ask our server if he can move the tables together in one straight line and he said  there wasn't room for that.  He was so reluctant to accommodate us that my guests had to rearrange the tables ourselves. So we all get seated and the waiter takes over 20 minutes to come back for drink orders.  I thought I'd start us all off with a double shot of chilled Patron to kick off my bf's bday. 15 minutes go by and drinks arrive.  The alcohol was so warm and never even  chilled at ALL!  I tried to flag our waiter down again to no avail.  After another 15 minutes waiting for him to return to the table, he re-appears and I tell him that the shots weren't chilled.  He just acted nonchalant and took it back.  By now, everyone's so irritated because the wait was so long that most of our guests had already drank their shots.  The waiter takes my shot back, has it chilled, and comes back with a bill for my bf.   He pleads with us and tells us that he won't be seeing us again and that he's going on a break and asked if we would mind closing the bar tab so he can go.  My bf, being the really sweet guy that he is, paid him about $220 cash and another $20 for tip.   New waiter comes, takes orders, re-appears after 25 minutes and randomly lays down a bunch of orders on the table and left.  So I started asking everyone what they ordered because nothing looked familiar. To my surprise, the waiter only got two guests' orders right and the rest was NOTHING anyone else ordered.  At that point I am livid because the waiter disappeared again and I'm looking around trying to see if I can flag ANYONE down to help us. For the last hour, no waiter came by to check on us or ask us if we needed anything.  Another 15 minutes go by and he finally returns.  We send back all the incorrect orders.  An hour later, half my guests are still waiting for soda!  Some are just tired of waiting and the other half finally get their food.  It was so unbelievable that the waiter disappeared again and didn't even ask anyone if they needed drinks, let alone refills, and or condiments .  My guests just gave up at that point, ate whatever was brought to them with or without drinks and or condiments. There I was, spending 90% of my time trying to keep my eyes open to flag a waiter down again for the 25th time! I finally decided to get up and find the manager.  I waited about 5 minutes near the cashier's podium and asked our initial waiter for the manager.  He immediately asked me if I was going to report him and I said I was reporting the other waiter. Little did he know, had it not been been for the great Facebook group shot he took for us, his ass would be grass too. Manager comes by and I tell him the entire story.  All he did was say he was sorry and to call him next time we come again and handed me his business card.  I told him I would never come here again and it was the worst service I had ever experienced in my life.  It seemed he couldn't care less.   Fed up, we just decided to end the night and close the bill. The bill totaled over $300 with a mandatory gratuity of 20% included.  When my bf paid cash for the bill he added ANOTHER 20% on the bill without knowing it was already included!  It's no wonder NONE of the waiters gave a rats ass.. They were already guaranteed 20% on the bill. Imagine if we actually itemized the bill!  There would probably be a ton of orders that wasn't ours. Too bad we didn't discuss the bill until we got home. I thought about calling the manager but I figure it would just create a lot more stress on us and we were just happy to have the nightmare end. We seriously could've had a better experience at Chuck E Cheese's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=740

We got an appetizer maybe a minute before our actual food. Then after 5 minutes at most of trying our meal, we were rudely asked if we already wanted dessert and after saying not yet, she quickly added how it would take a whole 10 minutes to make so she needed to know. After another 5 minutes, the same thing happened. I said yes for the heck of it and we got the bill set on the table before the dessert was set down. Not to mention that during the service, we overheard her talking to another waiter about how we needed to hurry up eating and that she was trying to rush us out. So rude!

The pizza here always comes out great.  The crust is always crispy but not overcooked.  The verity of toppings that comes with it always complements it nicely.  What I love is that BJ's pizza always reheats up nicely in your oven at home.  I actually think the crust is even better if you reheat it just right.   The only thing I don't like about this place is the long wait and the chicks taking down your name are always a little snobbish, although it's always a different set every time I visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=740

Their food is consistent, their beer is pretty good (I like the Nutty Brewnette, the Porter, and the Red), and they have a ""secret"" menu of specials near the back of the big fat menu. These specials are served ALL DAY EVERYDAY and make eating here very affordable. You can get the SAME  mini pizza as on the regular menu for multiple dollars less. Or you can get half of the giant baked potato with a salad/soup for $6.95! What $6.95?!?!?! Yes, less than 7 American dollars. whoa. And the giant baked potato is truly giant. Even half is way more than I can ever eat and it is GOOD. Also they have the Pizookie. yes, the Pizookie. You may feel ridiculous ordering it but it's warm, gooey, and very tasty.  So why only 3 stars? Even though it's plenty good nothing stands out. Also the wait on just any old night (even mid-week) can be pretty long. And when it gets busy the service invariably slips.

We started off with 2 appetizers.  First was the Spinach Artichoke Dip. I have never in my life disliked any Spinach Artichoke Dip, Never! This was by far the worst. I believe it's due to the Alfredo Sauce they use. It's insanely bland and really has no flavor at all.  Then we had the Chicken Wraps: These were actually really good. Nice crisp lettuce and the hot mustard sauce hits you like Wasabi. It MUST have wasabi in it because nothing clears my sinuses like Wasabi. It was great! Next I had a ""Wedge Salad"" Now let me say.....I have NEVER disliked Blue Cheese....NEEVER! It was so gross. It was sweet...and tasted nothing like blue cheese. It also had some type of green seasoning in it...Again...I was disappointed.  Then out came my Entree....Chicken Alfredo: silly me, I should have known to change my order once I tried the Spinach Artichoke Dip. This meal was horrible to say the least. It tasted like.....nothing.....it' really had no taste at all. It was a flavorless sauce, with flavorless noodles, flavorless broccoli and four tiny pieces of chicken.  I was going to suck it up and eat it....but then I thought to myself....I paid way too much for this to have to force myself to eat it. So I sent it back and ordered something else.  The General Manager came over, he was VERY nice and approachable. I explained my concerns about the flavorless Fettuccine and my issues with the salad. He brought me out a Bacon Cheeseburger and took the Entree and Salad off of my tab. He did what he could to make it right.

Kyle V.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,339,15,1.0,3/26/2007,"oh boy! i'm going to rip bj's a new one. A few friends and myself decided to go to BJ's after work for a little happy hour action. When told we were in for a 45 minute wait for a table I went directly to the bar and got a drink. After looking the place over now that I had my drink and I was just getting comfortable, I noticed something disturbing. What I had just noticed is that at least 80% of the patrons in this establishment were fat, ugly, white, middle aged, and lame.  DANG!! The quintuple strikeout.  OKAY. At this point I ask my friend why he likes the place. He says, ""It's just a really chill place."" I guess if you consider an Applebee's atmosphere mixed with a hint of McDonald's chill you would be correct.  We finally get our table and the rest of our party arrives. Immediately we are bugged two or three times by our overweight, ugly server for drinks. We had asked her to wait but she didn't know how I guess. We get done with introductions and are ready to order. Fugly comes back an IDs everyone before we order. One friend has an expired ID and she says she won't serve him. Okay, she's doing her job, but do you still have to be ugly and fat?? Some of us already had a drink so we decide to get one round and then bounce. We get a sampler and the dude with the expired license takes a few sips. He is obviously of age (25) and the license just expired. The manager then comes over and recards everyone (wtf) and threatens to kick us out of anyone not of age drinks. Since we are all of age we continue to drink and 5 minutes later the manager comes over and asks us to leave.  If you are into places where lame middle aged, boring, white people congregate to talk about buying new SUVs and their OC watchin' little kid's soccer practices, then GO HERE!!! If you like ugly, boring, fat servers who have no personality, then GO HERE!!  If not, go next door to Opah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=900

We were told it was a 10 to 15 minute wait. After 35 minutes, I told my husband to go ask what happened. he was told we were still on the list. Then they call another party that came in after us. Finally we find out they say their computer system is down and instead of a party of 2, they have us as a party of 4 with a baby! Ugh, so then we get seated and they had the nerve to tell us that it's not THEIR fault, the computer is down. Umm, excuse me but you gave us the buzzer and it never went off, you were still giving other diners the buzzers and also telling them 10 to 15 minute wait. If it's not your fault, whose is it?Then we get seated. The menu pages are stuck together with FOOD. I'm afraid to order food now. FINALLY a waitress comes and takes our order. I figure coffee would be good and a salad. She brings the coffee and my husband's beer. We get our entrees and I ask for a coffee refill. After 10 minutes, no refill, no waitress. I ask another waitress because my husband is ready to go to the bar with the empty coffee cup. She brings the coffee - but no cream! How hard can this be! The servers here have not sense of wanting to actually SERVE anyone! The entrees come and they are just ok. The table next to us has their entrees served wrong - the salad wasn't tossed and the dressing wasn't served on the side - they are complaining. the table across from us gets a dessert that they never ordered - the server is wandering around trying to find where to serve it. Then I get my cream for my coffee.  Here is a piece of advice:  let the servers assigned to the table actually serve the food and take responsibility for their guests. Your serving system stinks!  If you order an appetizer be prepared for it to be served with or after your entree. The timing of this restaurant makes no sense. They have redone the menu and it is very confusing with too many choices and the menu selection is just plain dumb - they have 3 chicken sandwiches?!! Why?  There is a reason the Lazy Dog Cafe next door is doing so well. We don't come here much anymore and now I remember why.  If you just want a pizza and a beer come here. Otherwise, go to the Lazy Dog Cafe next door - where they know how to serve food and drinks.  Also, we looked for any NEVER saw a manager on duty.

Raymond S.,"Irvine, CA",337,192,30,4.0,10/17/2006,"BJ's has become the obvious first choice when it comes to planning a get-together dinner party/event...or if you really crave Chicago-style pizza.  Why?  There's so many reasons.  The food; the location; the hours; the good times...oh what the hell, who are we kidding here?  It's the alcohol!  Seriously though, BJ's is all about great food and having a good time there while at it.  It's no surprise the stars of the place are their Chicago-style deep dish pizzas and their wide selection of inhouse brews.    The Tustin location is especially large and classy looking, making it the ideal location to host large parties for any sort of occasion or just to hang out during playoff times.  There's huge TV screens at the bar to watch all the latest sports playing.  Just be prepared to arrive early as this place gets crowded on most week nights, especially the weekends.  Service has been good for the countless times that I have been here.  With larger parties that are out in the patio, service can be on the slow side occasionally.  Your mileage may vary.  The food is great.  While nothing particular stands out as the greatest or the best, BJ's does serve pretty good meals that will fulfill your hunger.  Their signature Chicago-style deep dish pies is one big reason to come here and a definite must if you're a first timer.  Their pizzas are as thick as they are tasty - that's how Chicagoans roll.  I especially like the barbeque chicken pizza and blackened chicken.  But even the plain tomato and cheese will hit the spot.  If pizza ain't your thang, then there's the pasta and sandwiches.  I can't really comment on these as I almost always get the pizza when I'm here, but the pastas are quite filling and large.  Pizzas can range anywhere from $9-20 depending on size.  Of particular note: I wasn't too satisfied with their buffalo wings.  It lacked that spicy punch to it but still decent.  Then there's the brews.  A half dozen selections of house beers, hefs and dark ales.  All pretty good but I mainly come here with friends for the ciders.  The berry burst cider is amazing as it's sweet and tangy yet strong without you knowing it.  We order at least a pitcher or 2 of this stuff and then it's all over for us... The cider is so popular, on two occasions they were sold out so we opted for pear cider instead which is equally as good.  Finally, there's dessert.  You can't end the night at BJ's without some pizookie ($4.95).  It's so good, it's deadly.  Literally.  Even though it's really just a big warm and chewy cookie topped with ice cream, one has to wonder just how much sugar they jack into these things cause it's just insanely uber sweet.  I'm sure these babies will make one diabetic in no time.  It's almost ridiculous!...but mmm...so good!  a love/hate thing, indeed.  But maybe the reason BJ's is so popular is that they open late every night till around midnight.  That makes it a good hangout spot late into the night when hunger strikes or for just when you want to eat with your buddies.  Whatever the reason, it's good times fo sho.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=840

I thought that now that they have competition next door with Lazy Dog's they'd try a little harder to impress you with the service, but no, they probably don't care.  The last three times, my friends and I have gone to a late dinner around 9:30, which is not a very busy dinner hour, service has been pretty bad. It took over 15 minutes to get anyone to come up to us to take our order. Before that, all the servers just looked at our table without asking if anyone has helped us. It wasn't until after I asked another waitress to send over our server did our waiter come over (after another 5 minutes). On top of the late service, they forgot to get us place settings; they screwed up our order; and they'd drop off food and drinks and walk away so fast that we would not be able to ask them to get us condiments or to tell them they screwed up the order. I'm not one to complain about service that easily, but these servers do not have have the courtesy to ask if you need anything else or even apologize for their mistakes.

You may enjoy the onion strings, which I think tasted Ok. I thought it was too difficult to eat cause the strings were too thin and small.  The APPEAL = 8 Looking forward to coming back anytime, though not anytime soon cause we go there a bit too often. Pizooke!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=840

Heather G.,"Indio, CA",14,34,9,3.0,6/18/2012,"Bj pizza lovers beware! Stand up and raise your voices! I will start by saying that my star value on food would have been a 1 but when you factor in service from both the management and our waitress I gave BJs a 3. My husband and I love this chain and frequent it often. Which can be hard since we do not have one within a 60 mile radius. Needless to say we enjoy the atmosphere, the service and the pizza. Sadly we might not be able to say this for much longer. Last night we arrived waited 45 mins for a table for 4 of us, normal for a Saturday night, and we were fine with it. But we were famished once our dinner arrived. The sweet pig pizza looks a little different than normal, dry to say it kindly. After one bite we were all immediately disappointed. And despite how hungry we were no one at more than one slice. The pizza had NO flavor, it was dry and fell apart when you bite into it. Not BJs style. It was so bad that I had to ask out waitress if something had changed. I was not complaining or sending it back that is not my style. I just wanted to know if I was off or the pizza was. I was even a little embarrassed when I asked her. Because really how could a pizza place change their signature dish to something as plain and unappetizing as what we were just served. But sadly I am right, BJs in the Tustin market place is testing a new 6min pizza. Yes I said 6 minutes and that's not a typo! It is a piss poor attempt to fool you the consumer into thinking you are getting a quality made to order pie, when in fact half of the pie is pre made before you even walk in the door! Dominos doesn't even do that! And may i mention Dominos tastes a hell of allot better than this new pizza and is half the price. So if you are eating at this BJs or any or for that matter and the pizza is off don't think the establishment is having an off night. Say something to the manager on duty or we we all loose the yummy pizza that made this chain so popular!  Or if you do not want to risk it simply call ahead and ask if they are serving the 6 minute pizza or their traditional recipe. That's what we are doing. Good luck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=820

Today, I went to BJ's after work for happy hour with my girlfriend and I ordered the sliders, the cheese and tomato mini pizza and my friend ordered the chicken lettuce wrap. Yes..I love food and I was so hungry. I thought the sliders were perfectly executed. The Angus beef lies in between a soft, small, round bun with just the right amount of ketchup and of course, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on the side. Gotta love them pickles with the sliders. The mini pizza is a small deep dish but it wasn't too doughy or was it too heavy, it was just right in my tummy. Although I thought the chicken lettuce wrap was decent, maybe cause I was hungry, my friend didn't think it was all that good. I mean you can't expect to eat authentic chicken lettuce wrap at a brewery, right? During Happy Hour, the appetizers are two dollars off and the mini pizzas are half off but keep in mind, this is only valid at the bar area  during the hours of 3PM - 7PM. I don't drink alchy so I didn't pay attention to the Happy Hour special. Sorry. I do recommend you should go there early to grab a table at the bar during happy hour, because it does get packed.

flo c.,"Irvine, CA",147,775,98,4.0,5/9/2008,"3 1/2 stars. 4 star for Happy Hour, 3 stars for normal hours. A bunch of us yesterday came after work or so. I'm not sure if there was a wait to get a table in the bar area, because I was a bit later than everyone else and they had already secured a table and started ordering. By sitting in the bar area (which has normal tables), we got to partake in the Happy Hour menu. I missed what the discounts were and all my co-workers could remember was that mini-sized deep dish pizzas were half-off and that mixed drinks were discounted.  The service is nice but spotty. BJ's was PACKED to the brim. They were actually people waiting the entire time we were there. Thus, it's a bit of a challenge to find/flag down a server. However, once you get one, they're quite nice and experienced.  I tried: -""What a Peach"": ABSOLUT VANILIA, Dekuyper Peach Pucker, BOLS Peach Schnapps, orange juice, pineapple juice, grenadine and a splash of Sierra Mist served on the rocks.  -Buffalo Chicken Mini Pizza: For Buffalo Chicken Wing lovers - diced celery, red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in hot and spicy buffalo sauce, drizzled with ranch dressing. Served with extra ranch dressing for dipping. (Incidentally, I never got extra ranch dressing for dipping, not that I would've wanted it.) I really enjoyed both items. The drink was definitely fruity and light. If you aren't much of a drinker, that's a fabulous choice. I mostly tasted juice and nothing else. The served on the rocks thing was definitely true because there was A LOT of ice after I was done, and it wasn't because I drank it super fast. The pizza was good and not too spicy or heavy. I like deep dish pizza, so I could be biased. Final total:  The drink was a dollar off. The pizza was half priced.  With tax, it was a little over $12 total. In the past, I've also had a friend celebrate a birthday here and rented out the patio area. There's a set menu, buffet style, that you can order from with pasta, pizza, etc. That wasn't bad, but it wasn't really exciting. It is AYCE (I think) and for the price, it was pretty good for AYCE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=820

He forgot our orders. He had our table waiting a ridiculously long time.  Our bill came out with a mandatory 17% gratuity charge.  Our table split the order and I paid by credit card and he added an additional 17% gratuity on my credit card charge.  I asked him if he could do anything about it and he said no.

Andy C.,"Irvine, CA",51,124,7,4.0,1/3/2007,"This place is exactly what OC diners gravitate towards. Comfortable, consistent, unimaginative, yet priced fairly. They have good microbrews for $4 a pint (get the red, blonde or hef) and awesome appetizers (santa fe springrolls, nachos, thin crust pizza). If you get there from 4-7 or after 10pm on a weekday, you get 1/2 off mini deepdish pizzas and dollar off pints too. Their deepdish gets overall thumbs up from most people but isn't anything insanely good or authentic, but it grows on you. I think their classic bjs burger is excellent and the turkey sandwich is good if you drown it in some kind of sauce. The blackened chicken stuffed baked potato is good, and the calzone are crispy and satisfying. There's a lot of little things that are good if you take the time to order stuff other than deepdish. On the other hand, there are some downsides to BJs... If you don't sit in the bar area, be prepared for some slow service, I mean, order 2 drinks at a time because the waiter won't be back for a while. If you avoid going there during peak times (6-8:30) then you should be seated okay, but I prefer finding a spot at the bar, which is first come first serve. As for their food, sometimes their salad is old and gross but just ask for a new one and it they'll get it to you without question. Pasta isn't special at all, so i'd avoid it because meat and potatoes is where they shine. Oh and if you're on a diet... just avoid this place altogether, even their salad is drowned in bacon bits and dressing. I can't say i'm a meat and potatoes kind of person, but I find myself craving BJs a lot more than other restaurants that I'd call great.

It is not uncommon to see a group of the waiters conjugate at the front of the restaurant, chatting it up, only to remember that they have a job to do, not because they want to or are obligated to, but because they would get fired by their manager.  Oh wait, the manager is over there chatting with them too. Damn, I wish I were having as much fun as they were... P.S. lunch is surprisingly good here (tons of lunch-portion menu options).  P.P.S. I must have become tolerant from all the bad service I have received in this County to continually return.

The Fish n' Chips are just okay.  OMG the jalapeno pizza was delicious and the worst culinary mistake of my life.  I was crapping fire for days.  I was flaming in a place that really concerned me, but I couldn't mention to anyone.  Did the maniac doing the cooking put too many on the pizza, was he suppose to remove the seeds?  I don't know, but that it is a wicked meal that you will never forget.    Oh wait, I have also ordered their enormous baked potatoes with all of the toppings.  You can't go wrong with that and is a pretty good take home item as well.   A casual place, at a casual price, for a pleasant meal.  The waits are long a peak times, so call to see if they take reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=860

And here is where I had the best cosmo EVER...seriously...best EVER!!! 3) The pizza is delicious! And I've ordered many different things on the menu and never been disappointed Now for the bad part...... 1) Wait, wait wait! No matter the time or day you will have to wait. Last week I met a friend there for dinner...5 pm on a TUESDAY and we still had a 20 minute wait... 2) Don't go in big groups, they can't handle it. I decided to have my 21st birthday dinner there and lets just say that it took 3 days of phone calls back and forth and me hounding the manager (they kept ""transferring"" me from one person to another) to get a simple reservation locked down. In total I was put on hold for over 45 minutes.... definitely a let down 3) I have had many rude servers while eating here. Servers who completely crossed the line of appropriate behavior to a girl who just could have cared less...she literally brought the dishes out and just left them on the empty neighboring  table and told us to ""grab which one is yours""....now I don't expect to be treated like the queen of England but isn't distributing the dishes to the right person a requirement of the job??? 4) And the last time I ate there we had multiple problems with the bill. They charged about $30 more than I signed for. And again, I was put on hold forever when trying to get ahold of a manager who could take care of it. AND AGAIN it took about 2 days of back and forth phone calls to get the problem corrected.  Needless to say, I come here for drinks and appetizers (or pizza). They do take to go orders as well.

Alex M.,"Irvine, CA",6,21,,4.0,3/16/2006,"If you love deep dish pizzas, this is the place for you! My family and I used to go to the BJ's in Brea until they finally opened one close to home. But try to go before or after dinner or even lunch unless you want to wait about 30 minutes for a seat. Although sitting at the bar cancels out any waiting unless that too is full. Some of the greatest Deep Dish Pizzas reside here at BJ's. You can get the usual pepperoni, sausage, etc. but it's best to try some of their original pizzas. I LOVE the Buffalo Chicken Pizza which has buffalo chicken, celery, onions, and a side of ranch dressing. Even their standard pizza with pepperoni and tomatoes is great. You can get the pizza in a nice mini size for those who want their own pizza but I like to get small and bring the rest home for the next day. If you're not into pizza, you're in luck because BJ's has some great appetizers and sandwiches. Occasionally I get a Chicken Breast Sandwich on the Garlic Cheese Roll. One of my favorite sandwiches of all time. But you can't forget the Pazooki which is a signature BJ's dessert. They put cookie dough into a deep dish pan, cook it, and top it off with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. The best thing about this, apart from the taste, is that you can get it in whatever cookie flavor you love. I usually get a Black & White which is half Chocolate Chip and the other half White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. The only small problem I have with BJ's is how long it usually takes for the food.

Brian B.,"Santa Ana, CA",15,11,,2.0,9/22/2013,"stopped by here for lunch on a saturday (13/09/21). greeted at hostess counter by what appeared to be a manger. he asked how many, we said two, then he directed us to a girl who would seat us. neither asked if we would prefer indoor or outdoor seating. the girl lead us outside, past many open indoor tables. neither of us is a fan of eating outside, but the weather was decent so we settled for the outdoor tables rather than make a fuss. we noticed almost immediately a very sour smell in the air that we determined must have been sewage. it remained throughout the entire meal. we also spotted trash on the floor. we were greeted within a decent amount of time by our server who was very nice, however when my girlfriend asked for the available soups our server was unsure and listed them with no certainty - telling her the soup of the day was broccoli something. when my girlfriend had a follow-up question about the soup/salad combo our server didn't know and actually resorted to taking my girlfriend's menu (i guess assuming my girlfriend had not bothered to look at it herself before deciding to ask the question) to research the answer and ultimately did not find or provide one. while researching she did note that the soup of the day was in fact chicken noodle and that my girlfriend's menu was missing a page. we ordered a water & salad and a club sandwich & iced tea. food was good. the tea tasted funky. not bad really, just strange like it was made in an unclean container with remnants of a previous batch of who-knows-what. it did not taste like regular iced tea should taste. while we waited for our food i felt something on my arm. i lifted my arm and found a small spider dangling from a web on my elbow. i flicked it away. our food came out very quickly which was nice. during our meal though we were annoyed by a persistent fly. with no screens around the outdoor area and with the stench of sewage  in the air the only surprise here is that we only had to deal with one. both of us decided we just wanted to leave and when our server came to check on us we asked for our check. that was the last time we saw her. we immediately put our card with the bill and waited (and waited) for it to be picked up. finally, a server for a nearby table, who i'm assuming saw we were waiting, came over and handled our bill and brought a box for our leftovers. admittedly, we probably should've just requested to sit inside from the beginning, but we feel these problems are problems regardless. we've eaten at BJs many times but this was an exceptionally bad experience. we will not be coming back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=800

I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the far and few in between times I do decide to get beer, I typically go for Hefs with a lemon wedge. I also got a small size pizza with sausage, chicken, and mushrooms. The service here is typically pretty good, especially in the bar area.  I think maybe once the server was a little slow, but whatever. Our server this time was funny because at one point, all three of us were messing around on our blackberrys and when she came up and saw us, she started commenting on how she just got one and just absolutely loves it and continued to make other comments a couple more trips after that.  Plus she also went along when we were razzing each other about this and that.  I just like it when the server seems like they're really chill and enjoys being there as opposed to just doing their job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=800

No problem. We got seated and had a middle aged male waiter. Everyone ordered their alcohol, then it was my turn. What I like about BJ's is that they have fufu (non-alcoholic) beverages with refills. So I order some fufu flavored lemonade and as we chatted away, 4 of the 6 dinners come to the table. 10 minutes later the remaining meals arrive. At this point my drink is empty and as my husband is ordering another beer he tells the waiter that I need a refill as well. The waiter looks at us and in a rather annoyed tone says ""you're going to have to pay for the refill!"" I protest that their menu states that my drink has free refills and the waiter stares at us with a look of annoyance as my husband says ok to the charge for the refill. Of course as we were leaving the kids that work the hostess stand were too busy to discuss the charge. It wasn't about the additional $3 or $4 for the refill, it was his horrible attitude all together. Needless to say we have not gone back.

Their shrimp scampi is also superb... all the flavors that they put into it blend well.

Marti C.,"Canton, OH",48,232,89,3.0,3/25/2011,"When you go to Bjs you should really stick to the tried and true. Usually I get a pizza. The crust is buttery deliciousness and  it's thick and savory. I think over the years I have tried every version of pizza and they are all good. And the perfect end to every meal at BJs the pazookie - my fave is the peanut butter it is melt-in-your-mouth fantastic. Went last night and decided to off roading and ordered the pot roast sandwich with white cheddar mashed potatoes and oven-roasted vegetables. Yea. Mistake. It wasn't awful it just wasn't as delicious as the pizza. The white cheddar potatoes didn't even taste like potatoes all you could taste was the cheese. They were too heavy and overpowered by the cheese. I rated the potatoes first because that is what was most plentiful on the plate. Next came the vegetables: onion, carrorts and celery. They were only lukewarm and still hard. Hardly oven roasted. They were drenched in the brown gravy for the meat that was surely out of a can. Again not unedible just not uber tasty. Finally the meat, for a second I wondered if it it too came out of a can. Maybe the meat and gravy came together, not sure. When I think pot roast I think melt in your mouth meat that comes in big hunks that just falls apart. Well this was in like strips of preformed meat or something. I don't know. Again it was edible for the most part. I left more than half of it on my plate. The service at this particular location is always sketchy. Our hostess definitely thought she was the mostess, but she was not. All attitude, not fun. Our waiter was nice just sparse. He was more interested in flirting with girls at another table.

Michelle N.,"Irvine, CA",42,136,26,3.0,10/3/2007,"Bugger. I read all the reviews and thought this place would be relatively tasty, and it turned out to be slightly good. I got the buffalo chicken pizza (mini) with a salad and then split a chocolate chunk pazookie for dessert.  Salad was yummy (but it's a salad) but then the pizza came. All I have to say to it is 'meh'.  The crust and dough were nice but there was too much salt and spice going on in the topping to really taste anything else and the chicken was dry with crunchy edges. The ranch dressing dip was also bizarre. It sorta tasted ranch-ish with a touch of bleu cheese and, errr, water. I only used this to tame the spice and salt in my mouth and found it left an odd coating. Meh. My friend's pizza (the BJ's fave) looked good, but she wasn't too impressed with the flavours (too salty), and the sandwiches were all right. I give this place three stars though because of the really scrummy pazookie. Dear Lord. We (6 women) decided to split one because we were so full (they were, I was just feeling kinda icky from that dip) and suddenly spoon fights erupted as people vied for the gooey chocolate chunky bits with the ice cream. See, the pazookie is a cookie baked into a small circular tin with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top, and is the best thing since sliced bread. Seriously.  This place also gets stars because the servers and hosts were super friendly, and they even had the Euro Championship Soccer Qualifiers on, which just warmed my heart.

The whole thing took over 2hrs. The boneless wings did not taste like chicken, more like a mix of plastic and some sea creature you aren't supposed to eat. The deep dish pizza was basically a pile of wet bread with almost no sauce and glue like cheese. The corndogs were burnt on the outside and raw dough on the inside. My baked potato was gray and slimy. Seriously how do you mess up a baked potato? All it takes is an oven and a potato! The sliders were sickly sweet and the buns looked like they had been colored with a yellow highlighter. The queso was fuzzy. That's the only way to describe it, a fuzzy texture in your mouth. Even the fries were weird. Who leaves most of their fries uneaten? That never happens, but at this place it did. Afterwards all of us felt ill. Gordon Ramsay would have dropped F bombs in all directions here. We should have know after seeing the huge and confusing menu. Potstickers and jambalaya and pizza and pasta and burgers and seafood.

I could tell the gentlemen taking care of us might have been a bit tired after a long slow shift however that did not stop him from flashing a welcoming smile and going above and beyond with waiting on our table. He was stealthy on our H2O refills without us even having to ask or do the casual ""look around for your server cause I'm getting thirsty"" neck turn lol. He didn't seem bothered by simple requests like more buffalo sauce on the side or extra lemon for my glass of water. The pizza hit the spot as always and he made sure that we were 100% satisfied with the meal. We ended up scarfing our meals down before they even hit closing time which was perfect seeing how the dining room/bar was still 25% full at the time we left.

Also you can split two flavors in one pizookie. Customer service isn't the best, but I don't really expect it here I guess.

Gabriela S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",49,288,1171,4.0,9/21/2015,For once we had a great waiter who was enthusiastic and on a top of things as well as flexible with some food substitutions. The Bison Burger is always fantastic and the chicken Mediterranean pitas were great as well. I do wish they had more bottle beer choices (import) as not everyone likes brewery heavy beers and their light beer is like watered down ale. I do have to say that the hostess should either start taking some happy pills or change her profession- she was so miserable and unfriendly that if it wasn't for already being 2pm and us needing to eat before heading up to Pasadena I would have gone someplace else.

Jessie L.,"Sacramento, CA",56,114,126,5.0,10/2/2015,"My favorite BJ's! If you are a beer fan, try the Jeremiah Red. It is tastey! The parking here is decent. Haven't not waited to be seated when coming to any BJs, unless we snag a random bar seat or we have call ahead with large groups. I don't mind the wait since I love their food. Rarely get a bad server. We did get one girl here with a big group once.  She had a huge attitude and was very rude. Not to worry she got the tip she deserved. Nonetheless the service is good 99% of the time. I must say there are a few things here I secretly desire like always. The tomato mozzarella small bite, the sweet pig deep dish (droooool), the pazookis, and their beer on draft. My counterpart part can't help but order the black n blue burger everytime. He says it's hit or miss with how well the do the blackened part, but still says it's good nonetheless. Attributes: plenty of Tvs with games on, good for loud parties, large parties, vegan/veggie friendly options, best pizzzzza, beer on tap, easy to find location.

Jonathan S.,"Irvine, CA",1,27,1,1.0,1/6/2017,"**Not a place to bring your family - unless they all drink and love to be loud** My wife and I were having a casual date night on a Friday. Place was fairly crowded and we felt fortunate to get a seat in their extended seating area. Soon after sitting down we didn't feel that way though. An entire area of the seating section was dedicated to a group of about 20 people who were doing shots and other libations all while screaming and laughing - playing their drinking game I guess.  There were families with children around us and you could see the discomfort on the parents faces. It was useless for my wife and I to try to have a conversation over our dinner because it was so loud.  As we were preparing to pay and get out of there we asked if the manager was available to talk with and draw his attention to this issue. After giving him our feedback he was ambivalent in his response. I think his calculation was this is a group of 20, paying top price for each of their drinks, 2 customers don't matter.   So sad, I liked BJs until I talked with the uncaring manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=160

BJ's is serving the idea of bad food in an actual bad food reality... like, over-processed food that tastes like cardboard, or like something that could be acquired through a box... I ordered the safest thing on the menu -- a deep dish pizza -- and it tasted so artificial and cold(!), that I couldn't even eat it to be polite... the fact that they charge $15 for this, is what I found most mind-blowing... I could have paid much less for a frozen pizza, and would have enjoyed it much more.  I'm amazed that the place was so packed/that they even get business, but I guess there's a first time for everyone, maybe.

I asked to be seated outside, but upon arriving out on the enclosed patio we discovered how loud and hot it was out there. The girl seating us was so nice and brought us inside and found a little table right by the windows for us. I had two Kicked Up Sodas (Jäger and cream soda) and it was really good! I haven't had jäger to drink for awhile and I'm not a fan of licorice, but the flavors paired well together. The man had a root beer and said it was delicious...I'm all for an establishment who handcrafts sodas and beers! Food! We stared with an appetizer of Santa Fe Spring Rolls and mozzarella and tomato salad. The spring rolls were delicious, perfect portion for two people and two really good dipping sauces. The avocado sauce was my favorite. Then the mozz and tomato salad...yum! It was on their small bite menu and for $3 you got tomatoes, mozz cheese balls, red onion and some olive oil/spices on a bed of lettuce. It was fantastic and refreshing. The man got jambalaya for his entree and I thought it was pretty good! It was spicy, like a back of the throat spicy. And the portion was huge! Really good and highly recommended. I got the crispy chicken sandwich and added bacon and cheese to it. I also eliminated the honey mustard and added chipolte mayo to the sandwich. Excellent sandwich, huge sandwich to boot! The fries were ok...I got the thin ones and they didn't really do anything for me. Crunchy yes, but other than that they weren't anything special. The service was really good, our guy was attentive, nice and even offered his suggestion on the fry type.

This is another restaurant that has been in the neighborhood for years.  It's a very popular spot for beer and pizza lovers!  During football season this is the place to be.  They have tons of TV's throughout the restaurant even in the patio area.  They also have the most AMAZING wings and you can choose ""wings only"" instead of drumlets!  I love wings and these are my top 3 favorite place for wings. The white pizza is also very unique and popular but I prefer the New York pizza crust over the super thick pan crust.  Once in a while I do crave a nice pan crust and that's when we head out to BJ's. The pizookie is one of the most famous desserts at BJ's.  If you never had one you MUST order one.  It's a hot cookie with ice cream on top!  How decadent does that sound?  The white chocolate with macadamia is my favorite!  Mouth watering dessert!  Nice contrast of hot and cold.  Definitely a party in your palette.  Good place for a good time with friends, lively and happening every day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=400

We moved to Tustin and continued our weekly visit to BJ's on Jamboree.   Then they decided to use pre-baked Boboli pizza crust instead of real, deep dish pizza.  The soft, doughy bread that you usually find under the sauce and cheese....GONE!  Now you need a knife to cut your pizza because you're pizza is now a week old pre-baked dry P.O.S. with all the ingredient's heated on top.  What a joke. You're better off going to Little Cesaer's Pizza and getting their ""Hot and Ready"" deep dish pizza.   No joke.  BJ's, your pizza has gone to the birds, so I won't be coming back.  Sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-irvine?start=400
Desiree D.,"Irvine, CA",77,8,,1.0,8/7/2014,"Let me start off by saying my family and I love Bj's Restaurant. We frequent the restaurant and being that it's a favorite of most everyone in our family it's always an easy option. This being said our last visit to the Irvine location was anything but satisfactory. In fact it was downright rude, the service lacked but the food was enjoyable. Giving the benefit of the doubt to maybe the servers we had come in contact with were just having a bad day we didn't complain. It's understandably human nature to have an off day.   However, this is what set me over the edge refusing to go back to this location. Our family consist of three children. Needless to say we went to the bathroom a few times, one two wash before eating, once to take my younger daughter, then again my oldest daughter accompanied my son near the end of our meal. That last trip took longer than expected so excused myself to go check on the two leaving my husband and younger daughter at the table. Upon my return my husband says that he very distinctively heard a server at the station near us say, ""watch them"". Excuse me, I was appalled. Our family is not the type to cause a big stink so we paid and quietly left.  I will not be returning to this Bj's to be treated second rate for whatever reasons we were on this day. Our family really enjoys Bj's and have never received this sort of service at the two Huntington locations, Brea nor Orange. I would rather drive further to enjoy a meal peacefully. It's so very sad in this day and age that this sort of stereo typing is still occurring.
