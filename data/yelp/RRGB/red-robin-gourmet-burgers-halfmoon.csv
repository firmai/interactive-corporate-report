John N.,"Rensselaer, NY",1,85,,3.0,11/25/2011,"I know this is a chain and as such should expect certain things like a cookie-cutter interior and uniformed waitstaff - but it mostly works here.  The burgers are pretty darn good.  We tried four different burgers and all voted for our own as the best of the evening. My wife's sweet potato fries were the only real disappointment - not hot/crispy but warm and soggy.  The regular fries were very flavorful and hot and REALLY SALTY!  So salty that all of our lips are puckering even now, hours later.  As my mom would say, the salt is making my ankles swell - cankles are really unattractive. Service was less than good - slow, inattentive, inefficient.  But dinner on Black Friday may be some of the problem.   Unlimited refills on soda and refills on fries were offered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=40
Frank Z.,"Gaithersburg, MD",47,339,22,3.0,8/18/2011,"Red Robin is a chain, but it's pretty good for a chain. There are a few things working in favor of this restaurant: 1. They actually know how to cook a burger. Even better, if you ask for it medium rare, they'll give it to you medium rare. Some chains I've been to lately (like TGI Fridays) will refuse to cook beef medium rare. 2. Free refills on...french fries? What the shit? Yes, they have ""bottomless fries"" which is the french fry equivalent of free refills on soda. The fries themselves are OK but refills on them definitely elevates them. 3. Ridiculous number of burgers to choose from. Pretty much every conceivable combination of burger + toppings has its own entry on the menu. 4. It's fairly priced, which is why Red Robin is one of my picks when I'm in chain-heavy touristy places. You can reliably get a good burger and a couple of beers for under $20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=40
Heather R.,"Somerville, MA",17,22,1,2.0,9/8/2011,"Went on Labor Day and for so few patrons, in the middle of the afternoon, the service was unacceptably S-L-O-W, from a 20-minute wait to seat three adults and two kids to the taking of orders, delivery of food, checking up, and ringing out. My shake lived up to memory: possibly the thickest, creamiest, most-crave-able chocolate shake ever, probably because they blend with heavy whipping cream. They had good options for the kids (nephew chose broccoli and niece chose oranges with their meals). Dad also liked his fried fish meal. When I finally got my hot chicken sandwich (good but not exceptional), my sweet potato fries were cold, but their replacements were good.  Back to the service, we had to filch our own ketchup off another table and keep flagging the waitress down (fresh fries to replace the cold ones, more napkins, the dipping sauce that was supposed to come with the chicken for the kids, a refill on the iced-tea, the check...) when she failed to bring them outright or check up on us for extended periods!  The hostess was really gracious to let the kids pick out their favorite color balloons when we left, but decent food aside, it was a rather frustrating service experience: one we're pretty unlikely to repeat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=40
Christopher F.,"Clifton Park, NY",28,12,,4.0,4/14/2012,"We love going to this place. Gourmet is kinda a joke for a burger joint. They have a wide selection of burgers and such. Unlimited steak fries makes my wife super happy. Service is usually pretty good, and the food is rarely bad. Great for kids and families.

H H.,"Clifton Park, NY",0,2,,3.0,1/27/2014,"Good burgers! ""Bottomless fries"" serving sizes have been reduced and are now served in elevated baskets so it looks like larger portions.

Ashley K.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,2/1/2015,"By far the worst dining experience I have ever had. My fiance and I were being seated by the hostess (who was incredibly rude) & as she was bringing us to the table says to the restaurant manager ""can we lock the doors, I am so sick of people coming in."" We were seated at a small booth by the kitchen. Our waitress had come to our table and greeted us by saying ""we are out of silverware so I can't bring any to you now, but will as soon as I can"". We ordered our appetizer (pretzel bites) along with our entrées, but said we'd like them served separately. The waitress came back to the table to tell us that appetizers were backed up and may come out at the same time as our meal, but that she would have her manager comp it for the inconvenience. The appetizer came out and then our entrées under a minute after. As we were attempting to enjoy our meal, two staff members began fighting and the argument moved to the side of our table. The one waitress quit and walked out. The food was mediocre at best. The staff, including the manager, were very unprofessional and clearly did not care if the diners were satisfied with their overall experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=40

Dan C.,"Waterford, NY",12,20,20,5.0,5/27/2009,"Id first like to say that Red Robin is not what I would classify as ""fast food"".  I also would not attempt to compare a festive burger joint such as Red Robin with a Thai food restaurant.  Dont get me wrong, I enjoy Thai, but typically you are looking for one type of food or another.  I do not think Id ever find myself thinking out loud ""burgers or thai.... thai or burgers"".   In any event, my family loves Red Robin and the ""Royal Red Robin"" , which is the proper name for that heavenly heart attack burger topped with a fried egg.  When we go to Red Robin or call in a pick-up order it almost always includes the Royal and a shake. Im not sure how someone could say they like this place and then give it 3/5 stars (thats 60% which is a failing grade in any class Ive ever taken) The atmosphere is upbeat and noise level is on higher side... but if you have young children like we do it just loud enough that your kid's random outbursts blend right into the dull roar. If the atmosphere isnt your thing... call in an order.  We enjoyed their food a dozen times before we ever actually ate at the restaurant. TRY THE ROYAL RED ROBIN.... ITS AWESOME.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=40
Jess P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",79,380,,3.0,12/30/2008,"After driving in slippery winter conditions to find the one local kitchen store that actually had a chinois in stock, we needed replenishment.  We were already on Route 9, which appears to only attract chains, so we picked RR. Neither of us had ever been there and we were curious.  For a chain, Red Robin is pretty solid. Keep in mind that my stars are in comparison to other chains. I wouldn't exactly rate this against a ""finer dining establishment,"" but for what it is, it's really not bad.  It's a little intense inside, with lots of bright colors and a massive menu. I'm not sure I've ever seen so many burger selections to choose from, including a bacon burger topped with a fried egg. Mmmm.... heart attack on a bun!  No, really, that sounds pretty delicious but not artery-friendly.  You can pretty much customize your own option if you want, and most of the selections are under $10. Oh, and they have a gluten-free menu, as is pretty much de rigeur at chains. Still, I always appreciate it.  Each burger or sandwich comes with ""bottomless"" steak fries. The fries are quite good, but I'm not sure that anyone really needs ""bottomless"" refills of French fries. As Dan pointed out to our waitress, the fries might be bottomless but RR's customers certainly are not. We gave her bonus points for laughing at our stupid jokes and for being delightfully sassy.  Chain restaurants always have a menu full of ostentatious cocktails, so Dan and I always feel the need to get a couple, or more. This time we stuck with the basic margaritas, and honestly, they were surprisingly good. One might suggest that's because it's hard to screw up the delightful combination of tequila, lime, triple sec and salt, but I beg to differ. I've had some stomach-turning cocktails in my lifetime.    I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to get here, but  if we ever find ourselves starving on Route 9 again, we wouldn't be opposed to trying another burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=40

Cory D.,"Midlothian, VA",5,63,8,3.0,1/17/2009,"Jess X. is dead-on -- for a chain restaurant, the Clifton Park Red Robin is very good.  Their burgers are very tasty and the bottomless fries are a nice treat.  I recommend their Campfire dipping sauce as an accompaniment! Like with all chain restaurants, service can be hit or miss. I've been lucky, but friends have complained about long waits. Out of all of the fast food chain restaurants in Clifton Park, Red Robin is my favourite. It is fast food, though -- for only a few dollars more (and if your party is a bit more adventurous) I'd recommend Shalimar or Sushi-Thai Garden instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=40

Gary L.,"Elnora, NY",0,2,,2.0,12/31/2014,"They must have been short staff tonight, service was terrible, long wait time and lots of empty booths.  We were immediately advised by our waitress that she had a big table but she would be able to get to us, she wasn't.  We ordered our drinks appetizers and entrees  at the same time , didn't think we would see her again. After 5 minutes the drink order showed up; wrong, had to wait  again. The appetizers and entrees came out together but my wife's dinner was wrong so we sent the entrees back while we ate the appetizers.  My son's sandwich was served in a plastic basket with a sheet of paper in it, we took the sandwich out and noticed the basket was dirty with food, thanks for the paper barrier. The entrees came out in a reasonable time, again wrong, my wife's salad had the wrong  dressing, but we gave up and just ate it.   We did not see the waitress again, I waited 10 minutes after we were done before I ventured out to find my waitress, we already have been here 2 hours. I would normally tip 15% if the waitress just showed up but this time I could not, gave her 12%. I don't fully blame the waitress, the manager should have been walking the floor so he/she could see if there are problemd. Maybe it's time for a management change.

Morgan B.,"Norfolk, VA",0,4,6,1.0,1/15/2016,"Just had lunch at Red Robin and am pretty disappointed. I ordered the ghost chili burger because I like spicy food. The burger that came out was not spicy at all, it tasted like a regular cheeseburger. Then when the bill came I was charged for the nacho burger. I asked the waitress what I actually ate because it looked and tasted like neither of those. Her reply, ""Well you should've gotten what you ordered."" with plenty of attitude. I know what I should've gotten, this isn't my first trip to a restaurant I know how it works, what was I actually served? Maybe if you work at a restaurant that already has an automated ordering system in place the human servers should put out a little bit more effort before they're completely replaced by tablets. Then I find out that I was charged a $1.99 ""entertainment fee"" for the kids to play games on the table top tablet. Talk about cheap. you can buy all those apps for that. So basically my lunch consisted of getting the wrong food, being charged for something I didn't eat, not knowing what I was served and being nickel and dimed. Is short, this place has terrible service, bad burgers and hidden fees. You'll never see me in a Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=20

Josh B.,"Schenectady, NY",4,5,,1.0,8/14/2015,"First Red Robyn has a policy of no children in the entire bar area.  I just wanted something quick for my son, and when I came in there was no one at the front door so it seemed like the logical place to go.  The way I was spoken to was rather embarrassing, like with a who brings there kid to a bar attitude.  I was quickly rushed to the hostess area, after giving some attitude to the girl who didn't look old enough to drink alcohol was behind the bar sending me away.  I was sat in the back away from all other parties.  No doubt my attitude determined that and perhaps it was justified.  When I ordered the food I asked about the portion size the waitress had no idea how many shrimp came with the cluck and shrimp.  She told me 12 but I only got 5.  My son wanted apples but after they brought him fries we were told they were out of apples, he got the oranges instead.  I was constantly out of soda and it was not refilled until I had to flag the waitress down to get more.  Although the tattooed guy in the corner reeking of booze and shame seemed to catch her eye, as his glass was never empty.  Finally you would think with 2 managers here when I arrived and a third before I left one would stop by and ask how things are.  Instead there are to busy looking at some new lights that were installed and the slightly overweight one keeps flirting with the ones that are young enough to be his daughters, sickening!  Bye Red Robyn you lost this guy today!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=20

joe k.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,46,2,2.0,12/4/2014,"This place is a lot different then a couple years ago. The burgers used to be pretty tasty and looked handmade. However now they are using some tasteless frozen patties and skimpy ingredients, pre cooked extra thin bacon.  Our service wasn't great, the waiter was slamming things around and didn't seem to care when we sent the food back. Honestly the guy was tossing things around and literally threw straws at us from a decent distance, wet straws. Overall the food was not as good as it used to be, it was very cold and that didn't improve after sending the burger back. The buns were pretty stale  too. I seem to remember getting tons of steak fries and now they give you about a dozen in a tiny little tin.

Robbie M.,"Raymore, MO",3,116,35,4.0,2/18/2013,"Today was my second time patronizing a Red Robin. The first time was for Veterans Day where all veterans got free Tavern Double cheeseburgers. I couldn't complain whatsoever since the burger was cooked as ordered (medium), and it's hard to say no to bottomless steak fries. That time the service was good, and I had a good server. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name, but he's a red-headed single dad roughly around 30 years old and is overall a nice person. Today I visited RR because I had a coupon for a free burger of my choice since it's my birthday. This time I went with the bacon guacamole cheeseburger, which I thought was really delicious. On this visit my server/bartender was Megan (brunette with blue eyes, bit of a beer gut), and sadly she seemed very indifferent about customer service. It irked me a bit because there were only two people including myself sitting at the bar, and Megan didn't seem particularly adamant about checking on either of us. Overall, though, this is a nice place to get quality burgers. The prices are on par with other chain establishments, but the value comes from the endless fries. It's also nice that the restaurant is decorated like a 1950s diner, so it has a neat atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=20

Steve N.,"Albany, NY",164,381,697,1.0,3/4/2017,"I'm of the mind that Red Robin is the worst burger chain in America.  I was curious to try their new 'tavern' burgers to see if they are any better than the insipid, chewy hockey pucks their standard burgers are made with. The tavern burgers are made with two thin patties as opposed to a single thick patty. Nope, the tavern burgers suck too. The ""beef"" patties on a Red Robin tavern burger are tiny. The bun and toppings dwarf them, and you can't really taste them under all that stuff (I think that's intentional). The grind is odd, and it makes for a mealy, gummy, mouth feel. There is no char or caramelization on them, mine had only three thin grill marks on two gray disks that are so perfectly round, and so thin, you would mistake them for a beer coaster if someone plopped them on the table. They taste like a beer coaster too, there's no seasoning on them, and they have no beef flavor whatsoever.  What Red Robin sells are not burgers. They are selling topping, cheese, and sauce laden monstrosities on a bun, that just happen to have beef in them. Low quality, flavorless, mealy, beef.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon
Steve E.,"Tampa, FL",201,1582,5020,4.0,12/22/2016,"I don't generally frequent chain restaurants, but when traveling late at night, and while out of state, I'll gladly stop anywhere that is still serving food. My flight to Albany had been delayed, and I was powerfully hangry, so I pulled in to get something to eat before driving to my sister's house. That's what brought me to the relatively new Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Restaurant, located in the Halfmoon Crossing shopping center along Rte. 9 in Clifton, Park, NY. The Red Robin chain started in Seattle back in 1969, and they continue to open restaurants all over the country. They're best known for their gourmet burgers, unlimited baskets of fries, and fast, friendly service. I sat in the bar area so that I could catch up on sports scores. Bella was both the bartender and my waitress, and she was extremely pleasant. In between sips of my frosty cold Adult beverage, I cheered as I saw the Bucs had won, and placed an order for a burger and side salad. The salad was a grilled Caesar salad, and that turned out to be halved Romaine lettuce heads, grilled, and then drizzled with Caesar dressing and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Certainly a different presentation, but darned tasty. The star of the show was my A-1 Peppercorn burger which was a nice burger patty, topped with hardwood-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack, A-1 Peppercorn Spread, tomatoes and crispy onion straws on an onion bun. I added onion rings for my side. And in the immortal words of the Red Robin TV commercials.......YUMMMMMMMM!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon
Nancy S.,"Cohoes, NY",188,183,79,2.0,8/11/2016,"Pretty disappointed with our most recent visit to a typically reliable chain restaurant. Opted to sit at a booth in the bar area, and ended up having the bar tender as our server. Her personality was probably the only redeeming quality of our visit. Ordered an appetizer, which usually doesn't take long to arrive at the table, but when it had been 10-15 minutes, we knew something was up. Our entree orders ended up coming out, and we had to ask for the appetizer we ordered (was brought to the table by someone other than our server). I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, which came out as just a crispy chicken sandwich with the buffalo sauce in a container on the side, not a huge deal, just annoying. So, I asked to have it be tossed in the sauce. Husband ordered chicken tenders which were pretty standard. Waited a while for drink refills, as well as refills on fries. In general, the service was almost nonexistent. I'm not sure why they would schedule a bartender to be working the bar, multiple dinner tables in the bar area, as well as taking care of to go orders. I can't really fault her - although she was clearly overwhelmed, she remained positive. Just wish we didn't have to suffer the consequences of Red Robin's illogical staffing choices. I understand a chain restaurant isn't going to deliver a 5 star experience, but I've experienced better at some others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon

Roger K.,"Clifton Park, NY",127,583,2672,3.0,12/13/2015,"Our last visit was about a year ago, and similar circumstances dictated a return for dinner.  When we arrived about 5:30 on a Saturday we were told it would be about a 20 to 25 minute wait.  Looking around, there were at least 20 people ahead of us.  But the hostess hit the nail on the head as our party of four was called at 5:55 to be seated. I was interested in trying something other than a burger since the handful of times I've had food at or from RR it's always been some type of burger.  I decided to review the menu online before we left the house.  I knew exactly what I wanted as we sat down.  But I couldn't find a combo of ribs and mac and cheese on the menu.  In fact, I couldn't find ribs anywhere.  Our server then let me know that they no longer sold ribs.  Obviously, I had looked at an outdated menu. So I decided to have the Buzz Clucks & Mac 'n' Cheese ($11.79) along with a pint of Shipyard Monkey Fist IPA ($5.29).  For the curious, Buzz Clucks are like breaded chicken fingers tossed in RR Buzz sauce.  The chicken was nice and moist and the breading was crispy, but that Buzz sauce, while being spicy, seemed to also be sour tasting.  My wife said the sauce tasted like Tabasco Sauce but don't recall the last time I put Tabasco on anything so I couldn't necessarily agree with her.  The Mac & Cheese is billed as made with four cheeses.  I found it very bland.  Maybe it was four different brands of American cheese.  It's saving point was the nice crispy top. My wife ordered the Arctic Cod Fish & Chips ($12.99) and a Soda ($2.79).  The cod was light and moist with a nice crispy coating.  The fries were nothing exciting, and I suppose that's why they offer a bottomless serving of them. Our dining companions said they were pleased with their choices of a Bacon Cheese Burger, well done, ($10.29) with Onion Rings ($1.49), Teriyaki Chicken Burger ($9.99) with Garlic Herbed Fries ($.99), Poppin' Purple Lemonade ($4.49), and Raspberry Cream Soda ($3.79). This trip was also our introduction to the wireless menu device on each table.  It can be used for viewing the menu, calling the server, playing trivia games, and paying your bill with a credit/debit card.  I was somewhat impressed with the payment portion.  It seems to know what table you are at since it brings up a listing of everything you ordered.  I wonder if the device was swapped with another table if it would get confused.  We decided to tryout the device with our credit card.  When it got to the Tip portion of the process, it calculates 20% on a slider bar.  You can move the slider in either direction to increase or diminish the tip.  It then even prints out your receipt.  Pretty cool. However, it was only while I was writing this review and looking at the receipt that I realize that we were charged an Entertainment Fee of $1.99.  I have to assume that was for the trivia games we were checking out.  When (if?) we return I think I'll go back to ordering a burger.  After all, there seems to be over 30 to choose from.  It the option existed, I would give 2.5 stars for a non-burger meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon

Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",593,1477,270,3.0,2/7/2016,"I'm not wildly enthusiastic about Red Robin; I'll always try to go to a non-chain restaurant first. But I've never had any issues with meals at this Red Robin. Their service is fine, though it was very awkward to watch the restaurant manager ask some folks who had been lingering at their table if they could move to the bar so more guests could be seated.  I'd enjoy a less conventional beer list. The french fries are industrial. But I do give them credit, I feel their burgers are getting better, and the wait staff does go through your ordering options quite well. In my most recent visit here, while everyone enjoyed their meal, my vegetarian friend was disappointed they had a limited number of meatless options (though he did say he enjoyed his veggie burger). This Red Robin is a decent and convenient option for lunch or dinner when I'm in the Clifton Park area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon
Carol B.,"Watervliet, NY",56,13,,2.0,12/18/2016,"I keep holding off writing, hoping to like this place again.  It's a chain, and the food is pretty mediocre, not horrible, but not gourmet-quality, either, for the price.  Not much flavor, and too much bun, but the fries are good.  My biggest complaint (and this is true of the Latham location, too) is that it is always filthy.  We sat in the bar area at the hightops, several of which weren't bussed or wiped down for way too long.  The women's room is downright disgusting, again, this is more than once.  Unflushed toilets, trash all over the floor (yes, even a tampon once).  The waitress was friendly, although maybe one should tell her that calling people ""honey"" and ""sweetheart"" in every sentence gets annoying quickly.  This was probably the last chance I've given, because as much as I want to have that first experience again, which was good, it's clearly not going to happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon
Mackayla S.,"Clifton Park, NY",2,9,12,4.0,2/2/2017,"Red Robin is always a great place to go for lunch. I am giving four stars because the food and service were great. The cleanliness of the bathroom is what lost them a star. Anyways, we went when it was not very busy, and had a very pleasant experience. The waiter was patient, kind, and very attentive without suffocation. The ghost burger was great and just as spicy as you would think! The burger with the mac and cheese was also pretty tasty! Once again great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon
Blake L.,"Henrico, VA",1,13,,1.0,6/13/2016,"To their credit, they contacted me about my review and asked for my email and phone number. I gave it to them and they said someone would contact me in 7 to 10 days. I never heard back from them!!! My question is when you are such a big national chain with I am sure hundreds if not thousands of employees, wouldn't you have a dedicated person who takes care of responses? How long does it take to contact an unhappy customer? Why does it not happen the same day? Why does it not happen in the time period you said it would? Just curios.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon

Kelly O.,"Albany, NY",57,186,155,4.0,2/18/2016,"Yeah, they are a chain, but they're good. They get the burgers right, the fries are tasty (and bottomless), and the service tends to be fast and friendly.  It can be a nightmare to go at a peak time, but things do move fairly quickly. I personally prefer to sit in the bar area because it helps me escape the inevitable hordes of kids (no offense to kids, just prefer not to sit with a bunch of kids at this point in my life). One thing I find a bit funny is their emphasis on their ""brews"" - like most chains, there are some decent options, but most of it is the standard fare. If they actually did step up their beer game, I'd be all about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon

Tyler M.,"Corinth, NY",0,11,4,4.0,9/30/2015,Me and a couple of friends went here because we had no place to go at all. We sit down and they have a little electronic tablet. It has games on it which a 99¢ a pop. Also when you're done you can pay your meal on it. Can go up to two orders on one check.  If you're looking for burgers this is the place to go. They have burgers I've never even heard of here. Really good! You get unlimited steak fries. (My Fav) so don't hesitate to ask for more. Little pricey. I got a regular burger and fries and it came out to be around $15. But well worth it.  Nothing to bad here.

Mike L.,"Latham, NY",52,451,419,2.0,11/10/2013,"Red Robin is the Friendly's and Ground Round of the new generation. A place where you can bring all your screaming kids, let loose and get cheap food. It's been awhile since I had been to Red Robin but they used to have this smoothie that was fantastic. I couldn't remember the name of it and didn't see it on the menu so I asked the waitress if they still had smoothies. She said ""Yea, they can probably make you a smoothie. I think they have strawberry or banana."" So based on that I assumed they no longer had the specialty smoothie I used to get. Later I come to find out they had a separate drink menu with the smoothies listed on it and they still had the one I was looking for. It was called the Hawaiian Heartthrob. Then I was really annoyed that she didn't mention it or at least point out where the smoothies were on the menu when I had specifically asked.   The food came out pretty quickly and was decent. But I have no desire to go back and be surrounded by screaming kids all night and dumb waitresses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon
Jim W.,"Mechanicville, NY",5,66,5,4.0,12/9/2015,"Burgers are like pizzas. Everybody likes them ""their way"". I'm not quite as fussy as most folks, I guess. I can appreciate any that reflect a good effort. Red Robin's are some of the absolute best that I've had, is all. My only complaint, and the primary reason for 4 stars rather than 5, is the number of choices on the menu. A burger joint, even a ""gourmet"" joint, shouldn't be so complicated, y'know?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon
