Diana E.,"Pompano Beach, FL",652,268,275,5.0,1/8/2018,"This is my third visit to this restaurant in the Gainesville area, I usually go to the one down in Coral Springs.  I love this location as much as I do my regular one. The beer is always nice and cold, apps and food on point and this time I had Ivana as a waitress who was wonderful. I even ended up getting a free Pozooki with my BJ loyalty points AND buying two movie tickets at a discount price ask your server for details. Score!  I will definitely come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Cierra G.,"Fayetteville, NC",196,121,195,3.0,11/29/2017,"I don't have much of a review for this BJ's location.  I've visited only one other BJ's location, in Tallahassee, FL, and I loved it, but I also went there to celebrate and have drinks.   On this particular visit, in Gainesville, FL, on a super long road trip back to NC, my husband and stopped here because we were hungry and tired.  We happened to come during lunch time, but it was early lunch, 11 am maybe, so the lunch crowd wasn't quite out and about yet. The hostess greeted us as soon as we entered the establishment and we were seated right away.  Our server came soon after and told us about the lunch specials.  She brought our drinks, took our orders and went on here way. The food was good, especially because we got a great lunch deal, however, it seems that she forgot to charge us for the special, she charged us regular price, but was quick to fix it after paying attention to our receipt. There was nothing special about this visit, just ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Robert R.,"Gainesville, FL",55,55,85,3.0,10/1/2017,"I have eaten at BJ's many time. But, it's exceptionally average. I enjoy the atmosphere and all the sports. It can be a bit loud sometimes.  I tend to enjoy the food but I have had some disappointments as well. The chicken tends to come over cooked and isn't great to begin with. But the fish tends to be good and not over cooked. The deserts are good. Some of their mixed drink are really good. I enjoy a drink like that. It's pricey but delicious.  Overall, I don't turn down an invite to go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Pam S.,"Blountstown, FL",1,3,2,2.0,9/30/2017,"This was our 1st time at BJ'S ever at Gainesville...thought we'd give it a try. Kinda wish we'd never gone there. We went there after a game about 3:30 pm & wanted to grab something to eat before traveling back home for 2.5 hours. We were seated immediately, which was great. However, we waited 10-15 minutes before we finally HAD TO ASK for our waiter/waitress. She came within a few minutes & was friendly enough. It was another 10 minutes or so before we got the drinks. I had a vanilla cream soda float & that was very good. We ordered the stuffed spinach mushrooms with garlic pesto aoili sauce as an appetizer. When we saw them, we were disappointed at the size of them...of course, we didn't know what to expect being new. There were only 6 of them but other restaurants at least give medium to large sized mushrooms. They tasted very good. We had to flag down our waitress AGAIN to order our entrées (deep dish pizza)...THAT took another 10 minutes to locate her. She was flittering all around us, when we actually got a glimpse of her, but she was NEVER attentive to us. We ALWAYS had to ask other waiters/waitresses for what we needed. When she brought some refills on our drinks, she said that she'd bring us some parmesan for our pizza. Did she ever bring it?? NO! So, we flagged down yet someone else. She never even commented or asked (or apologized) for not bringing it. We had already eaten 4 pieces of pizza before we got some. When we were finally ready for the check & a to-go box, my husband finally got up & went to the little area where the waiters/waitresses were to ask for the check & a box. Seconds after the box was brought, she happened to bring the check & she saw that someone had already brought a box. We will NOT be going back to the Gainesville BJ'S again...and we are there often during football season. Maybe in another town.... maybe. The vast menu was somewhat overwhelming to go through & pick just 1 thing (besides an appetizer). It would be better to have maybe 4-5 pages, front & back....not 20. To end on a somewhat high note...we loved the ambience & warehouse feel of the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Nan T.,"Gainesville, FL",16,316,2441,4.0,7/4/2017,"After a five year absence, I swore I would never return. But I did. (I was strong-armed.) And was I ever surprised! To our benefit, it was a late dinner & there were few patrons on site. Kudos to waiter Erich K; management should clone him after having him train the entire staff on how to serve professionally & w/ 100% accuracy. Kudos also to the chef for the Avocado Egg Rolls appetizer (see pic), which was one of THE best avocado appetizers we've ever eaten; the crispy golden brown wrapper, fresh abundant avocado, red onion, & soy-based dipping sauce were amazing. (Thanks for the recommendation, Erich!) The flavorful, slightly spicy Double Bone-In Pork Chop dinner (see pic) w/ crisp garlic green beans & cheddar mashed potatoes was both huge & superb! (It was another great recommendation.) The Tomato Bisque soup was very good, as was the Golden Beet Arugula salad. Lots of tasty food, decent prices, phenomenal service, & a pleasant decor. Kudos all around! But, unfortunately, there was one downer-- a 20-page menu (23 if you include specials) that is so extensive I lost interest after the turning of the first five. (Robert Irvine would poo poo that sucker:) Within such a vast & varied menu SHOULD at least be a page labeled, ""The Best of the Best that We Offer"" or something that sounds more creative while catching the attention of customers like I who found the monstrous menu most annoying. (FYI: According to our server, the menu will soon grow by 7 new items-- at least two of those items will be new chicken wing flavors.)  Thank you, BJ's, for redeeming yourself! And thank you Erich K. for being great at your job:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Kristyn W.,"Gainesville, FL",271,59,89,3.0,1/24/2017,"Bj's Restaurant is mediocre for its entrees and selection - the only reason I go here is for their chocolate chip pizookie to be quite honest! The ambiance on the inside of the restaurant is quite nice, giving you an upper class type feel however the menu just does not cut it for me. I struggled to find something to order because nothing caught my eye. This was my second time coming to Bj's and I've noticed that they changed the menu. I used to order the cajun chicken pasta, but now that's not available anymore. I was a little stumped because the one dish I liked was now gone!! This time, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken as my entree which came with roasted broccoli and mashed potatoes, but I mistakenly swapped the mashed potatoes out for a broccoli cheddar soup (HUGE mistake)! The soup was extremely cheesy, so I did not finish it. I was told by a friend after my experience that the mashed potatoes are to die for, so if you are going to choose this dish, then I guess stick with the mashed potatoes. We also ordered a couple appetizers - avocado egg rolls, calamari, artichoke dip and a California chicken flatbread. All of these items were pretty good, but nothing special or different than what you can find at a TGIF or Chili's. The ONLY reason I would be willing to go to BJ's would be for their chocolate chip pizookie!! It is basically a cookie that is baked in a deep dish (like a pizza) and has a couple scoops of vanilla piled on top. The cookie is warm and with the ice cream, you achieve that melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness!!! Plus, if it's your birthday, you receive a free mini pizookie with a candle lit in it! Like I said, not my favorite restaurant to come to because it's really average however the pizookie's are amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Kim R.,"Gainesville, FL",213,209,444,2.0,12/4/2016,"The restaurant has a nice high-end vibe to it and a good atmosphere for socializing and good interactions. The food left much to be desired. As a matter of fact it was costly below average appetizers (sampler). I got home with my leftovers to share with my husband to show him what he missed out on. I opened my goody box and he said, with a straight face, ""What's that?"" It was avocado rolls and boneless chicken wings and if I return to BJ's, I will not order it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Jen S.,"Streetman, TX",2,55,14,2.0,11/7/2017,Ok I am picky. Came to eat for lunch. Did the bar thinking it would be faster and waited by my table for three mins. Then finally a busboy came to clean the table. Almost walked out. The tomato sauce from the previous guest was smashed into the cleaning rag and the chunks came flying toward my tan shade shoes and the tomatos left streaks on the table . He didn't notice it wasn't clean and left chunks on the seat with the smear on the table.  We have the best waitress running full tilt however when the hostess finally arrived with menus she did not send someone to clean again. So my clean silver is resting on the paper napkins. Don't go here unless u don't care about cleanliness. I did ask the hostess to tell the manager but here I sit. I am ordering the prime rib!

Scott R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",170,191,1160,2.0,5/17/2017,"Fellow Yelpers, 1.5 stars  BJ's restaurant in itself tries extremely hard to be something it's not. It's begging to be the Cheesecake Factory. It wants to have a little bit of everything. I even think it's to the point where corporate office needs to take a look at the menu and ask themselves what type of restaurant are we?  Nothing on this extensive menu in my opinion is worth ordering to me  pages and pages on items that are all underwhelming. The kitchen staff must have it absolutely insane in there. The menu has 22 chapters. With all area of pizzas. Ordered the flat bread pizza (it was horrible) flat bread was more flat and harder then a saltine cracker. Ok so now we know I clearly am not a fan of the food nor their menu.  The service is hit or miss. Orders are all taken on a mobile device so they are staring at a screen the entire time while placing your order. I can see the menu is too large to remember everything so that's why they must use them.  BJ's brewery?  I never visibly seen anything that shows they are a brewery. No tanks or anything I show the process of making beer. No creativity   Bj's actually has a large space and nice interior and even has potential with a lot of changes  I will not be a customer nor do I recommend this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Crag F.,"Charlotte, NC",0,7,,5.0,10/23/2017,"Been here twice. And I'll be here a lot more. Menu is huge, not sure how they do it. Pizza, great - both flatbread and deep dish. Steaks, killer. Homemade guacamole, also great. Fish and chips, like from the coast. Seriously, not sure how they do so much so well. And their beers? What? Huge selection, all brewed in state, not far. I live in Charlotte, NC, and visit here to Gainesville often, so I'm not a local. There may be better places, but I doubt there's a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Lee L.,"Ocala, FL",19,113,240,4.0,6/8/2017,"My latest trip was about a month ago, during a weekday lunch.  We were a party of five total. The restaurant was not busy at all.  Our server came over and took our drink order and then our server disappeared and while she tended to other tables, she never acknowledged ours. I finally got up and approached the server and politely asked her to come take our order.  The food came out and it was good, as BJ's food usually is.  Even when it came time for asking a simple question to the server, she left and returned 10 minutes later with no answer.  We finally asked for the check and about an hour and a half later, we were finally leaving the restaurant.  My issue was with the amount of time we spent in the restaurant during a weekday lunch, when people need to get back to work, for example.  Those people would be late. There is no way anyone who works would think this is acceptable for a chain restaurant. I know you can do better than this during lunch time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville

They have a large selection of own-brews and their menus is quite extensive, from apps to pizza, pasta, salads, burgers, sandwiches, soups, bar food, and more.

I paid a good amount of money for the food and what I get are the smallest 2 pieces of lettuce and 2 miniature pieces of chicken, it was more of peppers and sauce then Chicken for my CHICKEN lettuce wrap which I have ordered many times previously and I get a lot more then that.

Rick P.,"Gainesville, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/1/2017,"I have lived in Gainesville for 2 1/2 years and tonight I had the worst meal I have ever had in Gainesville! When the Grilled Chicken Alfredo was delivered to the table I found it so dry that I literally had to pull to separate the fettucini. I was able to find 2 pieces of chicken approx. 2 inches long and 1/4 inch thick. On the plate were 5 pieces of broccoli which were cool and uncooked! I am sooo disappointed! My wife had Spicy Peanut Chicken with noodles which she said was flavorful with an adequate amount of sauce, but once again had only 5 small pieces of chicken 1 inch cubes. Both meals could not have had 1/2 small chicken beast combined.  The last time we dined at BJ's was about a year ago and the food was great and plentiful! What happened?

Long waits for a disappointment.  I was recently at BJ's with a couple of other critics and we decided to all order the same thing to check consistency.   We all ordered the BBQ Bison Burger with the ""Gourmet"" Mac n Cheese .  The mac n cheese....noodles were rubbery and the cheese was congealed which means was in the oven too long,  as for the burgers, we had a trio of sizes, small, medium and large but skinny.  My bun was crisped to the point of biting harder than normal, one of my friends buns seemed to dissolve away the more he bit into it and the last one was soup.  Inattentive wait staff and uncaring at our polite dismays.  NEXT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville
Richard D.,"Gainesville, FL",8,38,43,2.0,4/4/2016,We dine here very often. The half price appetizer special is very good. The food is generally good. The service is iffy however.  We dined Easter Sunday night. It was relatively quiet there which is unusual. The service was poor at best. We got a pazookie with ice cream as an entree and there was no spoon. Didn't get that until it was nearly finished by eating it with a fork.  Then the grilled sandwich we ordered had soggy cold bread on one side. The other 2 items were hot and fresh. They were obviously made last. The general manager apologized and took half the sandwich off.

Caroline J.,"Jacksonville, FL",260,232,74,3.0,11/23/2015,"The good: drinks! Whether you want alcohol or sodas, you can get some amazing concoctions. BJs brews their own sodas and beer in-house! The atmosphere is also pretty fun and welcoming. The ""eh"": The food! I've had some pretty good options here (like a flatbread) and some ""Meh"" options (The portobello sandwich). The food wasn't BAD, it just didn't blow me out of the water. Keep in mind that I'm a vegetarian so there are only 3-4 options for me to choose from.  The ugly: The prices! Goodness, a small alcoholic beverage can run you 12-13 bucks. The entrees are also around $12-30 for what I honestly could probably get at Ruby Tuesday's.  This place is nice to sit at the bar and enjoy an appetizer. It has a friendly atmosphere. Watch your wallet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=20
Jim W.,"High Springs, FL",118,91,231,3.0,12/27/2014,"We happened into BJ's on Christmas Eve.    The place was about half full.  We were warmly greeted by a hostess and seated promptly.  Our waitress was quick, timely, and didn't forget anything.  She was also very personable. The menu at this place is massive.  Pages and pages of selections.  It goes against every bit of the theory ""stick to what you're good at"".  It's obvious that most of the entrees and sides are frozen then steamed or nuked.  No kitchen can keep that much fresh food on hand.  It shows in the taste and presentation of most of the dinner items.  They do a pretty good job of steam and nuking though. The beers are pretty good and it's fun to try the different creations that they have.  Domestics are available if you have an aversion to microbrews. The best part of BJs menu are the lighter side entrees.   This is one of the few restaurants I can go to and order something that doesn't have a full days worth of calories, salt, and cholesterol in a single meal.  Some entrees are less than 600 calories.  Very nice.  I know some fast food salads that have over 1200! This isn't my first time at this restaurant.  My previous experiences have been the same.  It's middle of the road and solid.   What more can you expect from a chain I guess?  Good luck and thanks for reading my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=20
Loren O.,"Manhattan, NY",4,55,17,2.0,7/5/2016,"We came in for lunch and it took an hour and a half before we could escape. The server kept forgetting us. We never got refills on drinks despite finishing them in about ten minutes into our meals (both our meals were super salty.) We even asked our server for more drinks and after 30 minutes he brought ONE water out for a table with two people. It wasn't a busy day. There weren't a lot of people there, but every single step of the meal took ages. We were seated pretty quickly, but it probably took 15-20 minutes for our server to take our order. Our food took at least 30 minutes to come out, and it was another 40 minutes or so before we were able to get a check.  My mom got a burger and the fries were cold by the time it came to the table. Her burger itself was also weird. The lettuce tasted slimy. It was just your normal burger, nothing fancy, but she didn't even eat half of it. I got the fetticine alfredo with grilled chicken and it was super heavy and really greasy. I maybe ate half. We were supposed to get a free pazookie with my reward points, but we told our server not to bother since after our meals we really didn't want to eat anything else.

The crust had a good flavor but I would have liked it to be chewier and not so light. The fresh tomatoes on top were a good alternative to sauce. Get the Parmesan Crusted Chicken...it was true to its name, it was crusted and not a soft Parmesan covering. North Beach  Mahi and Shrimp was good but the broth was a little watery.

Boon C.,"Tampa, FL",363,1504,8724,4.0,3/7/2015,"Great American style food. I love to stop by here when I travel north I-75. This is one of my many visits in this restaurant. They are located just outside of the oaks mall. It is a mile off I-75. When I drive from Tampa, this is my 2 hours driving stop. The restaurant customers are the Mall goer, UF student and professional. Very little tourist. Today I have the Classic Rib-Eye for lunch. I have their New York Steak before. But the Rib-Eye is the go to dish if you have to chose between the two. The dish comes with two sides. They have great selection of the sides in the menu. Today, I have chosen the roasted asparagus and the soup of the day - clam chowder. I like the ways they have select the material, the asparagus should be young and thin stem - less than ¼"" diameter. This is the best size that asparagus is not too fiber. The asparagus is grilled and season with spice. The clam chowder is actually comes in a bowl not a cup size. I have crust some black pepper on top. The clam is good chunk size. It is good for the hungry person. My rib-eye is come with good size also. I like it when it comes with a bit of fat that enhance the flavor of the steak. The gilled the steak to my order medium rare. I like the wood fire smell when they have the steak brought to me. This is typical American cuisine to near perfection. The meat material is good for the price that under $20. The restaurant has the handcrafted beer. It include the BJ's Light Switch Lager, Brewhouse Blonde, Piranha Pale Ale, Hop Storm IPA, Berry Burst Cedar and more.....

Kelsey L.,"Fort White, FL",0,16,8,2.0,5/15/2016,"My boyfriend and I ordered food from this place. A appetizer and two meals. We got the calamari and I got the steak with mash potatoes and vegetables and he got the cherry salmon and we also ordered cheddar broccoli soup.  I'll start off with we ended up getting four broccoli soups instead of the Caesar salad my boyfriend also paid extra for. We did call and they took it off.  The calamari was horrible. No favor what's so ever. We threw it away. The steak was chewy, the mash potatoes was good, but the vegetables were disgusting. I ate the carrots out of it.  Let's move on. The cherry salmon my boyfriend said was good but the sauce tasted really weird. The best thing I'll say  was the broccoli soup. That was delicious. But the whole meal came out to $70 and just was not worth it to us. Go to chillis. Or tji Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=20

Coty S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1903,1448,3683,3.0,4/27/2011,"DJ's reminds me of a cross between Hop's and a sports bar.  The food is just a little bit better than at most sports bars, but the price is jacked up.  They ask your name and how many are in your party, even if you do not have to wait for a table, which is not needed.  Then, you are escorted to your table in a sea of seating dividers, then surrounded by televisions and handed a 20 page menu.  Most of the menu consists of alcohol and you have to check every page to see all of the food they offer.  Like most places, you are expected to order immediately.  So you basically have to have it memorized. Like Hop's they have house made (company made) root beer, but at least it is free refill.  My main attraction was their new small plates menu which ranged from $3.00-$4.00, which was on a photo menu on the table.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese with bacon (bland and runny), the Caprese style salad (delish!) with balsamic reduction, and the Spinach Stuffed Mushroom caps (will pass next time, lacking in texture and flavor). My Mom loves their Grilled Salmon, which is like $17.99 for a small rib of salmon on a plate of mayo smear.  You can get something much better and classier at Bonefish for a dollar less, if you are into these chain style places.  I had the Chinese Chicken Salad with citrus dressing, omitted the fried wontons, it was very filling covered in grilled chicken and actually worth the $10.50 paid for it.  We had to order a Pizooki, it is a mushy dessert cookie in a small pizza style pan with ice cream on top.  It was squishy and expensive.   Still debating if we should give them another try.  I wanted to take more photos, but it seems pointless because there are so many pictures of the food on their website.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=60

Yes it's a nice building. They do have a nice after work bar setup.  But the service is always average. They seem to forget about you. A big issue for me is this..I love blue moon..I love an orange slice with my hefeweizen. When I order their hefeweizen style I always get lectured on putting the orange in their beer. I've gotten ""we won't put it in, you'll have to do that, we'll put it on the side""..I've gotten lectured by the waiter that they don't offer that, and when I insist they do is begrudgingly.

Peter P.,"Orlando, FL",0,19,1,2.0,11/30/2014,"I went to BJ's with some work colleagues because, well, it's Gainesville and there isn't much in the way of anything to eat that isn't corporate low-brow. So, I suppose it fits in. Picture a Ruby Fridays or a TGI Tuesdays with more beer selection and you pretty much got it. Service was spotty, forgetful, uninformed. The place smelled like rancid fry oil, which explains the food. The food offered is almost entirely fried, overly-salty redneck food. Our table sampled a good bit of the menu, I had a ""pizza"" with the hope of it not tasting like everything else that went in the fryer that week (the experience with the sampler appetizer gave us a heads-up on that). It was like the puffy, salty, greasy, flavorless pizzas from WaWa. Even the Pepperoni was junk, below Hormel. I hoped the beers would get me through. After realizing they pretty much only had high-volume mega-brewer pee pee (sorry folks Shock Top is junk and it's Coors anyway), I turned to the bottled beer list. Hooray! They listed several domestic and imported farmhouses, saisons, and some sours. The server was pretty confused and pronunciations were a giggle, but one after another, he returned to tell me they were ""out of that one"". After several tries, he came back with a printed list of what they were out of to make it easier on me: it was pretty much their entire decent bottle selection (see uploaded photo). I settled for a special they had on tap, a poor attempt at a pumpkin ale. Horrid. Two stars for being affordable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=60

Josh S.,"High Springs, FL",7,84,,2.0,7/25/2014,"I don't understand how BJ's continues to thrive in Gainesville. I don't know what I was thinking during my last review. Granted, it was three years ago. I guess their success is partially because the location is convenient to the mall, NFRMC, and I-75, but so is the building behind Red Lobster, and a business couldn't succeed there if they gave away free food with unlimited government funds. On the other hand, it seems that BJ's will never die, no matter how many things they get wrong. It's not that the food is that bad... the Pizookie is a tasty dessert, and I always enjoy what I'm eating, even if it's not overly thrilling. They also have a decent beer selection (their branded beers aren't great, but aren't terrible), and they have pretty good lunch specials. In fact, the lunch specials are the only reason worth coming anymore. The space is way too big for its own good. To their credit, they don't have unoccupied tables at peak times, leaving customers scratching their heads wondering why they can't sit in the section with fifteen open tables. But it also creates chaos, because they have too few inexperienced servers assigned to too many tables. A ""quick"" meal will invariably take at least an hour, no matter what you order or how much you try to hurry up the ""check please"" process. Also, the food is extremely overpriced. Aside from the aforementioned lunch specials, you will be hard pressed to get out of here for under $15 per person. So, so, so not worth it. I'm annoyed at myself for writing such a long review for a chain restaurant (an updated review, at that!), but one more thing: this is one of the few places I have ever been that will charge you for infant-sized portions of a side dish. I hate to sound so entitled, but if I ask for a thimble of black beans for a baby, at least tell me that you are going to charge me over $4 for it. Might as well just order her an entree and call it a day. $30 for two beers, a margarita, and a baby black beans.

Brian R.,"Marietta, GA",4,35,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Let me start with the fact that we frequent BJs. I've been going to BJs for 16+ years and usually get decent service at this location. Not sure what happened today...took maybe 10min before our server even got to the table, but we were told by a trainee that our server would be right with us. When the server finally came we were ready to order. We order drinks, chips and salsa, and lunch. My wife ordered her beer with an orange wedge. Drinks came, wife's beer had no orange wedge so I walked up to the bar to get one. Chips and salsa never came so I had to hunt down our server to cancel that as we wanted them before lunch came, wouldn't have thought we had to say that when ordering, got nothing but an OK, no apology or anything. When our pizza came, our daughters fries didn't. We asked the lady how long it would be for the fries, she rudely said 2-3 minutes and so ""pleasantly"" asked us if we wanted her to serve us our pizza, we declined. Our sever checked on us, we mentioned the fries hadnt come yet, she said she would check and again no apology. The fries did come a few minutes later. The entire time we were seated our server checked on us maybe 2 times while the tables around us had her and the trainees undivided attention, very frustrating. We paid and were leaving, I stopped the manager to let him know about our experience. He apologized and asked if there was anything he could do, he did seem sincere, but at that point it was done; just wanted to share our experience with him so he could address it with his staff. So, I thought this was the end of this bad experience. We were out shopping and realized my daughter had lost her security blanket. We didn't recall seeing it while we were shopping so assumed she had left it at the restaurant. I called to see and was informed it wasn't turned in and they couldn't find it where we were sitting, but she took my number and said she would call me if it came up. Luckily we were close by so 15min later I stopped back in to see if they had found it, and it suddenly appeared on he bottom shelf of the hostess stand. Clearly they weren't going to call me to tell me they ""found"" it. Not sure what that was about but pretty sure it had something to do with leaving our server $0 for a tip and me voicing my concerns to the manager.

The waiter was nice but my husband asked for an extra side and when it wasn't given the waiter said he didn't hear him say that and it would be an up charge for the side. I'm not a cheap person by any means. But at that point the waiter should have told him not to worry about the up charge since he ""didn't hear him"". If he was writing the order down he might have remembered. (Im just saying) also we simply wanted lemons for our waters but there were none in our glasses but we didn't bother saying anything about that.  We didn't want there to be another up charge.........

It's nice that they have quite a variety of food but not all of it is great that was a group of 12 of us and we tried and shared each other's food it had some flavor it was nice presentation it was hot but it was really nothing outstanding.  If I had a group of friends who really didn't know what they wanted to eat and had no real sense of what all the food was I would probably bring them here because it is a chain restaurant that does a fair job of making a lot of different products for a lot of tastes.

The ambience is very loud a lot of music playing I'm busy nights you a lot of people hanging out at the front door or around the hostess station and it's very crowded.

Pam D.,"Addison, TX",156,619,1091,2.0,3/8/2011,"My friend wanted a burger and a beer to celebrate, and this is where she picked. I was just along for the ride.  We sat ourselves in the bar area and found out BJs was running a happy hour special: most appetizers, flat breads, and mini pizzas were 1/2 off. Draft beers were also $1 off. Thank goodness for that, because even though their beer list is very large and diverse, the prices were about $2 more than I see at most other places. Speaking of beer, none of their brewhouse beers intrigued me. With so many other unique beers on draft, why would I try one of the house beers? Anyways - if you're a beer lover you will definitely find something on the menu to sip on. I ordered a Bell's Oberon, which didn't really taste like a Bell's Oberon, but maybe I just haven't had it in a while. We started with mozzarella sticks (half off) and they tasted like they were straight out of the freezer. In fact, there is no way a restaurant can maintain this large of a menu without utilizing tons of processed and frozen foods, so this big menu was a huge turn-off for me.  I had the sweet pig mini pizza (also half off). It was the perfect size for me for a normal entree- it's about the size of those pizza hut pizzas you can get in the airport. It was okay. The crust was so deep and doughy that it just felt like a big ball of dough instead of a pizza.  My friend had a burger which she customized with added avocado. She loved it, but I thought it looked pretty gross. The patty was much thinner than most other places. Also on her huge burger, she only got one slice of avocado so we had to ask for more.  Service was spotty. Our beers took about 20 minutes to get to our table; they arrived after our appetizer.

Also, I frequently had to wait for my glass to be refilled though, to be fair to the waitress, their glasses are on the smaller side of medium and, when filled with ice, don't really hold enough for a thirsty person to drink and still have a lot of liquid left over.   Given the combination of price and service, I probably won't eat here again any time in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=80

Not a big deal, but definitely should have picked up a menu while I was waiting to have time to really look over everything, instead of just thinking I could pick something when we were seated. There are SO many choices for drinks and for food, that I felt like once I had decided on everything I might like to try, I had a usual restaurant's menu in choices. I am sure this means that some of the items suffer because the kitchen can't possibly keep up a high standard on ALL the items on that menu. Consequently I tried to pick something that wouldn't've been sitting in a pot or under a broiler for a long time waiting for someone to order it. I think that has to be the key to ordering here. Pick something they might have to make to order. I had a pear cider, but that doesn't even begin to cover the drink options here. Basically I am going to declare BJ's impossible to accurately review in one trip. If I return here, I'll have to review again and pronounce a better judgement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=80

First of all, I've worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years, I know she didn't want us to sit outside! Obviously if she would've been more understanding to what we wanted then we would've tipped her 50% of our bill. Instead she made us feel like we shouldn't sit outside because it would inconvenience her. This is why I'm rating 3 stars.

Nicole B.,"Austin, TX",111,362,176,2.0,8/8/2012,"I had never heard of BJ's before coming here a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised with the menu. However, I was here with 3 other friends and they messed up 2 of our orders, after making us wait for about an hour for food. First, they served my pizza with onions, which I had requested be taken off. Now, if there were just a few here and there I would have made do. But the pie was literally overflowing with sautéed onions, which I just am not a fan of. So I politely asked if I could get one without onions and the waitress was very gracious and apologized. My friends and I had already been waiting for SO long for our food at this point (which the waitress kept coming over and apologizing for, so I assume it was the kitchen's fault) that she said ""do you want to just keep that anyway while I have them make you another one?"" and I said ""yes, that's fine, thank you."" I guess she thought my ""that's fine"" meant ""don't make another pizza, this one is fine"" because I never got the 2nd pizza. My friends, also thinking I was about to get a new one, happily enjoyed this free addition to their meal and ate all but one slice of this already small personal pizza. So in total, I had one piece of pizza, stripped of most of the toppings. It was my fault for not saying anything when she came back, but at this point it was nearly 10pm and my friends had eaten their food, so it just wasn't worth it.   The second order mess up came when my friend just never got her food. They served 2 of my friends and me (with the onion pizza), but my 3rd friend never got her food--they hadn't put the order in and she had to wait for them to make hers. The manager gave us a free cookie dessert as an apology, though, which was considerate. Sadly, the dessert (a ""half baked"" red velvet chocolate chip cookie called a Pizookie) was insanely sweet and rich and I did not enjoy it, though my friends did, so a personal preference.   The bit of pizza that I did have was good, though I thought it was overpriced for the portion size. That, combined with the wait time for the food (over an hour, and the place wasn't crowded!) were enough for me to give this 2 stars in good conscience, despite the mishap with the pizza that I would usually brush off as a miscommunication and misunderstanding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=80
Lanise A.,"Miami, FL",7,85,98,4.0,2/13/2015,"Decided to try the Deep Dish Lasagna from here, although they may as well just call it Ravioli since it's not really lasagna. Nevertheless, it was the lunch hour so the restaurant was pretty busy. I did manage to be seated and get a drink without waiting quite some time. I thought I would order an appetizer before the big meal, so I opted for Mac n Cheese. Big mistake. Although it looked good, the taste said otherwise. Soon after getting Mac n Cheese my lasagna arrived, and it tasted delicious, but I'm not too fond with all of the sauce. The ravioli was drowning in it! I also wanted to order my pizookie early to save some time, so while I was eating my 2-flavor pizookie (Chocolate Chunk & Cookies and Cream) was served.  Overall, the food wasn't bad, but I know that I can save money by skipping the appetizer and ordering water instead of a soft drink and lemonade which is almost $3.

I told him we only have one salad and we ordered three he told me they bring stuff out as it is ready and they are working on it. I had to explain that when a family comes in to eat a meal together they intend to eat together not one at a time. I was taken back at what was going on it made no scene at all!

The appetizers could've been better; the slider appetizer has four Krystal-sized little burgers with rather tasteless thin little patties of meat and alongside as toppings are precisely four pickle slices with a sprinkling of shredded lettuce and nothing else, some tomato would've been nice. The fried artichoke hearts weren't quite hot on arrival, some of them had disconcertingly cool centers. The calamari was overdone, you don't expect the tentacles to have the texture of toothpicks in your mouth.

The bartender took it to her manager, who then brought it back to me and told me she couldn't accept it because it wasn't laminated..... I explained to her that it wasn't lamimated because of the counterfeit-proof paper they use, but she wouldn't listen. The paper license is made out of paper similar to a dollar bill.. you hold it to the light, and it has hidden watermarks that couldn't be copied anywhere. Laminating a paper license that you could only verify when held to the light would make it an illegal license.. We left the restaurant immediately extremely disappointed without ordering, and walked to Buffalo Wild Wings across the parking lot who happily accepted my paper license at the sight of the official water markings.

C.P. H.,"Gainesville, FL",121,8,,2.0,11/28/2015,"This was a disappointing visit.  My husband attempted to order the Southern Fried Chicken with something other than the red pepper succotash.  We knew this would be tricky, because, in the past, some servers have refused, but others have happily accommodated his request for a different vegetable.  Last night's server, Liana, refused, and offered the option of removing the red peppers and adding a separate side--for an additional charge, of course.  He ended up ordering something completely different (which came with asparagus that was improperly prepared, but that was the least of the night's problems). During the meal, the manager, Joseph, came to speak with us.  He attempted to pass off the succotash as a ""garnish,"" though it is, in reality, a side (2 ounces of anything is far more than a garnish).  Despite continually saying that he wanted to do what he could to make things right, he never really offered any concessions and, in the process of his ""explanation,"" ended up speaking condescendingly.  (One should never say things like ""I'm trying to help you understand"" or ""make this clear to you""--it implies that the customer is not intelligent.)  Joseph's explanation also implies that the kitchen staff is incompetent:  surely it is not difficult to get a ticket that indicates another vegetable be put in place of the succotash.  Given the enormity of BJ's menu, there are certainly alternatives that could be made.  It's clear that this is about laziness on the part of the server (and perhaps the kitchen, although they cannot be faulted for a decision made by the server).   Another aspect of Joseph's failed explanation dealt with ""consistency.""  We agreed that consistency was a problem, because servers on previous visits have made the substitution with no debate.  Perhaps the consistency the management should be striving for is that the servers consistently do what they can to accommodate what are extremely simple requests from customers; that's the kind of service that makes us want to return to a restaurant.  After last night's visit to BJ's, we're now rethinking if it's worth returning, knowing that simply ordering meals could become an ordeal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=40

The wait staff was pleasant, our waitress was nice, helpful and attentive.  We had the 4 beer sampler, with Blond, Hefeweizen, Red, and Brunette. Personally, I prefer dark beers, and the Red was my favorite. I was not impressed with any of the other beers we ordered. The husband-like-man prefers Hefeweizen's and didn't even finish his.

Their quality of selection is pretty good.  When I first went, prices seemed a touch high, but then I discovered happy hour on my subsequent visit - and that's where it got good. I think it was dollar of all drafts - which brought them down to a reasonable price. And half off all appetizers, including a few other things like flatbreads. All the appetizers I've had, have been great, and provide plenty of food to fill me up. I especially like the chicken dumplings and the ahi poke.

So far, I've had most of the appetizers--the best beginnings (spinach/artichoke dip, Santa Fe spring rolls, avocado egg rolls, mozz sticks), the Piranha Pale Ale nachos, the potato skins, the shrimp lettuce wraps, and the chicken wings.  The only one that we've ordered more than once were the chicken wings.  The other dishes don't stand out for better or worse. We've had all of the flatbread pizzas and enjoyed them thoroughly.  Those actually taste good and come out hot and fresh, which is a problem with some places in town (yo, New Deal!).  I would return for these. Entree-wise, I've stuck with the baked potatoes or the fish tacos.  Both are enjoyable enough to keep me from being picky.  I do observe what other people get when I come, but none of it looks like a must-try. As for the deep-dish pizza, very recently Brice and I tried a create-your-own pizza with ... meatballs, sausage, green peppers, and roasted garlic.  Could it be?  Is that ... an abruzzese pizza?  It is!  So that means we still don't like their signature pizzas. We're currently live right next to this place, but we're about to move, and I'm pretty sure that I won't be driving back over here to eat unless it's 11 p.m. and I happen to be awake and hungry.  The late closing hour is pretty much the only thing that keeps me coming back, but heck, I can make baked potatoes and flatbreads at home.  2.5 stars for the consistently good waitstaff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=120

I spoke to the manager, who apologized and offered me gift certificates, but we won't be going back.  This is a pattern for this restaurant. Once, I ordered a special Alpine martini and got an apple martini.  No big deal until the waiter returned with the same drink and told me that the bartender didn't know what I was talking about. I had to show  him the menu to get the drink that I wanted. Another time, I sent food back to the kitchen because it was wrong. The waiter took it back, still came back wrong. Then the MANAGER took it back and it still came back wrong. My husband was finished eating and I hadn't received any food.  I was shocked that I was still billed for the food.

Chet L.,"Gainesville, FL",44,65,25,2.0,4/27/2009,"Tried this place out the other night, somewhere new and trendy where we could all feel like we were cool.  We were put outside right underneath the loudest speaker west of the stadium, which gets really annoying when Todd Party Of Seven doesn't respond the first eight times they are called. Won't mention our server's name here, but we had to ask for utensils. And napkins. I wanted a straw but that would have been another trip. If she had tables inside as well as outside, then this is partly the fault of whoever scattered her tables so she couldn't concentrate on one area.  The food was okay. Waited ten minutes to try my chili after it arrived since the server forgot my Tabasco, but the rest of the food was arriving by then. Was told a 'Wedge Salad' was a quarter wedge of iceberg lettuce. It was more like a thin 1/8th of a quarter. So I guess it was actually as she said, a quarter of a wedge of undermined width, and I just assumed that meant a quarter of a head of lettuce. Anyway, it was okay, but goopy since their was much more dressing than lettuce. Since my friend's food was there by this time, I had only a bite of the chili before asking for a container. Having camped out that weekend, I am 92% sure it was Hormel's chili. If not, they did a great job at copying the essence of canned chili. Friends had the meat loaf and chicken parmesan dinners, both looked great with creamy mashed potatoes, but neither cared for theirs. The meat loaf was gelatinous and the chicken was sliced so thin there's no way it couldn't have been dry. Some chains have a policy that the manager is supposed to greet every table at one point during their visit. If BJ's has this policy then it wasn't followed or I would have mentioned this at the time. Wanted to see a pizza but no one near us had gotten one. I didn't have a beer, maybe if I'd just gone to the bar and not eaten it would have been a better experience for me. But  I got to do the 'told ya so' routine and insured that the next outing with be my choice and will be far from the mall. Parking was fine.

Brice O.,"Gainesville, FL",10,18,1,3.0,5/27/2009,"So after going to BJs a few times, with a few different people, at a few different times, I think I've figured something out: BJ's is a pleasant dining experience hidden in a field of land mines. I've had an overall pleasant experience dining there but I've noticed several things about the place that I knew I should immediately avoid. 1. DON'T GET THE BEER, IT'S A TRAP! I guess since it's a ""Brewhouse"" people feel obligated to at least try the beer. While I'm not a beer drinker, I've been there with casual beer drinkers and some pretty hard-core beer drinkers and the best reaction I've seen to one of their beers is ""meh"" with the more normal reaction being some kind of vague nasuea I will say that the first time I went they were nice enough to bring out samplers for me and my co-wokers (free of charge).  2. Just avoid the alcohol all together. I'm not a beer drinker but liquor is another story. I know that individual bartenders have as much to do with the drinks as anything, but drinks in restaurants are too expensive for me to get another one after getting a bad first drink. And the Manhattan I ordered was easily one of the worst drinks I've had this year. 3. It's worth eating but not necessarily worth the wait. This is a newer restaurant in Gainesville and in a high traffic area. So it's going to be crowded, especially during the times when the slightly older crowds would be eating. I've noticed that going there around 10pm or for lunch the wait is negligible, but during normal dinner time you're probably looking at a 40 minute wait (at least while this is the new place to go). The restaurant really doesn't help itself in this area because (outside of the bar or outdoors) there are no tables for small parties. Each table could easily seat between 2-6 people, which makes you feel a little put off when you've got 6 people and see 2 person parties taking all the tables.  4. The food is good, not outstanding. There's nothing on BJs menu that's going to make me go running back to them, but there's plenty there that I would gladly eat if the opportunity presents itself. I personally like their Fish and Chips (although it's admittedly a little on the bland side), Burger Melt, and the cookie desert. Also, I'm pretty sure my wife hates each one of those things with equal passion, but she's been able to find several things on their menu (like the baked potato) that she likes as well. So there's nothing wrong with the food, and some of it might offer a pleasant surprise, just don't go there expecting anything life changing.  So overall, I do like this place, and I'll be going there again at some point, I just have to make sure I avoid the alcohol, don't go when I know it'll be busy, and keep my expectations at a moderate level. (hmm, I swear that was supposed to sound better than it came out)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
J B.,"Miami, FL",0,11,,4.0,4/1/2013,"We have eaten here numerous times.  The service has always been great, as is the food.  Food prices everywhere are going up, and BJ's is no exception.  I have never been there when there wasn't a lot of people.  This is a good sign the food is good.  I do recommend this restaurant and will continue to visit.  Keep up the good job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Kate P.,"Gainesville, FL",0,4,,2.0,10/21/2013,"Went there today to celebrate a co-worker's b-day. Ordered a simple turkey sandwich, added charge for avocado. We got there at 11 when it opened so no crowd yet. The sandwich came with the core of the lettuce on it and less than a slice of avocado. Mentioned this to the waiter. Instead of bringing me a little more avocado, which I requested, he insisted on taking my whole plate back to remake the sandwich. By the time it came back out my lunch hour was up and my party was finished eating. Had to take my sandwich home in a box. I wasn't asking for a free meal but a small adjustment off the bill would have been nice since I paid $11.00+ to sit and drink water and watch my friends eat and take home a sandwich that I didn't have time to eat once I got back to the office.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Stacie W.,"Gainesville, FL",29,43,7,4.0,1/15/2012,"I like that this place is centrally located and their menu is so large that we can go and something different every time.

Gramley A.,"Gainesville, FL",18,68,,4.0,8/24/2011,BJ's is an enjoyable place to go in Gainesville. Good food great beer and they even have gluten-free options. Their gluten-free pizza as actually decent and a comparable price to Pizza Vito,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Gator D.,"Gainesville, FL",0,20,,3.0,1/24/2014,Been here more times than warranted given price and food. Most foods are pre-prepared and reheated and cannot be modified. Good beer selection but expensive. Happy hour at the bar is the best value with half-price mini pizzas. Usually always very crowded and calling ahead for a reservation still will not guarantee you seating when you want it. They say they will stay open late however I have been there a few evenings and have been gently given the check when it has been a slow night. I wish my friends did not like coming here as much as they do. Service here is also very hit or miss depending on how crowded the restaurant is and how many people are in your party.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Kevin W.,"Gainesville, FL",13,25,,3.0,5/8/2009,"Ok, so maybe I was a little premature in my original review.  Came with friends for Cinco de Mayo.  The place was relatively busy, but we got a table pretty fast.  The worst part was the wait time for drinks.  10-15 minutes per order.  I felt bad for the server who was actually really good and nice and attentive.  She kept apologizing for the bar.   I ventured away from their pizza and had the chili cheese burger.  It was decent, but nothing incredible.   The next time I go, I will sit at the bar again and order pizza.  Stick with what works, I guess.   I still think the place is decent and worth visiting again.  I enjoy the atmosphere and decor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Maria D.,"Gainesville, FL",0,5,,5.0,12/16/2013,"Probably my favorite chain restaurant in Gainesville, hands down. They have a fairly large menu, even though I always go for the pizza or burgers (their fries are delicious). I love deep-dish pizzas and theirs never fails. Check out their lunch menu (only on Monday-Friday) for some good deals. Last time I went I got a mini pizza and salad for about $8. If you sign up for their rewards card, they send out free pizookies (cookie with ice cream on top) pretty often. This place is my go-to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Shirley N.,"Dunnellon, FL",1,18,,3.0,8/8/2012,The kitchen is very slow.  My meal was not prepared as I wanted.  Salads very good.  Beer too expensive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Belle C.,"Gainesville, FL",10,82,,3.0,12/29/2009,"My fiance and I ended up here for lunch on Christmas Eve after finishing up some last-minute shopping at the mall.  I'd been curious about this place, but also wary of it because it looks like a knockoff Hops, and I never liked Hops.  Also because, although it's not actually in the mall, it's a mall outparcel and I never have good experiences with Mall Restaurants.  But we were hungry, and were already parked right in front of it, so in we went. The spiral-bound menu opens with a list of their specialty beers, which we didn't try.  The rest of the menu is a bit Cheesecake Factory - esque; they have a little bit of everything (soups, salads, sandwiches, pizza, dinner entrees).  We had a hard time deciding, so ordered a few things to try: avocado egg rolls, barbecue chicken chopped salad, chicken club sandwich (typical chicken club with the addition of avocado), and California chicken sandwich (this one had peppers, cheese, and chipotle mayo).  The avocado egg rolls were delicious, but you have to like avocado because that's about the only thing in there.  I enjoyed the salad, too - it was huge, and had a good ratio of toppings to lettuce.  The sanwiches, however, were completely bland.  Sandwiches come with a choice of seasoned wedge fries or crispy thin fries; we got one of each and both liked the crispy ones better.  Service was cheerful, enthusiastic, and quick. Overall, it was a pleasant lunch and I'd go back to try more of the salads and appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Lois R.,"Blue Bell, PA",2,38,,4.0,11/28/2012,"Went to this with my son and his girlfriend, just for dessert.  We shared a Pizookie Trio and it was awesome.  Menu said fresh-baked cookie, and this was still warm from the oven with ice cream on top.  They thought the chocolate was too rich, but it was my favorite of the three.  TVs in all directions, which was good since we were monitoring multiple football games.  The only negative was that after we were seated, it was quite a while before a server even came by to see she'd be with us shortly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
R. S.,"Gainesville, FL",0,21,,4.0,5/24/2010,"We have eaten here several times recently, both as just my husband and I and also with a large group twice.  I'm not sure why this has received such poor reviews - I consider myself fairly picky and I didn't think it was that bad. They have a huge menu, similar to Cheesecake Factory or TGI Friday's.  So if you don't like restaurants with a chain feel, this may be a strike against it.  I think because they have such a broad menu, they have a lot of variety but not every dish will be top-notch.  My husband really likes their deep dish pizzas.  I was pleased with the roast beef sandwich and cheeseburger, but I was disappointed with the calzone I ordered once - it was really small and honestly I've had better at takeout pizza places.  Overall, I think the prices are very fair but I did notice that they don't bring out any bread or salads for the table. Service has been pretty good and we have always been seated in less than 10 minutes even with a large party.  We received poor service once, when our server also had a large party and pretty much neglected us other than taking our orders, but that seems to have been an exception. My favorite thing about BJ's and what keeps us coming back is the huge selection of beers.  They have at least 2 pages of draft beers, including their own microbrews.  It reminded me of Stubbie's and Steins, but less pricey and more accessible (Stubbie's has more selections of course, but I thought BJ's was impressive considering it's mainly a restaurant and not a bar).   Overall, I think this is a decent restaurant for a casual lunch/dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
felicity b.,"Gainesville, FL",0,33,,2.0,6/18/2009,Tried this place twice.  It seems quite overrated to me.  Once I got a burger and the next time a pizza.  You can't really walk out of there without spending quite a bit of money.  Especially if you get a beverage. The atmosphere is very open.  You are literally right on top of the table next to you unless you get a booth. Food is just like eating at an over glorified Chili's that serves pizza.  I will probably only eat here again if someone else pays for the bill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=140
Camilo R.,"Gainesville, FL",0,9,,5.0,3/22/2011,"I love BJ's! Its a favorite spot for my family and friends to go when we want to do something special but not too pricey. I always go with their sandwiches, their burgers are great (especially the bacon cheese ones!) and my favorite entree is the balsamic glazed chicken. In one word, amazing. Their fries are delicious, and if you don't want to get their alcoholic beverages, getting their freshly brewed root beer is a must! It is by far the best root beer I have ever tasted, not too fizzy, dark and rich, with a slight toffee note. The best thing to do after a satisfying meal here? Get a pizookie, they are freshly baked deep-dish cookies served a-la-mode and are to die for. I have honestly come here just to order a pizookie and root beer (some say too sweet together, I say its just right!) Service can be a bit slow, but I have yet to experience something I didn't like (anything with their pale-ale chili though is so-so not amazing but not bad)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-gainesville?start=160
