It's attached to the mall so I'm sure it gets super cray around dinner/lunch time but when we came around 11pm it was empty. All of our food and drinks came out on time and everything tasted fresh. They did seat us at the back of the restaurant considering we were a pretty big party and about 7 different waiters helped us for one thing or another (I guess because we were in such an inconvenient spot?). They also only asked my boyfriend and I for ID for drinks because ""You guys look too young"", which is embarrassing when they didn't ask anyone else.

We didn't have to wait long which was a plus but our dinner ended up being over two hours due to the slow and rude service. Our waitress was less than happy to be there and acted as if we were an inconvience on her night. When I asked where our lemonades were in a polite manner, she responded by saying very harshly and an eye role saying that the bartender was still making them. Would have been nice to know during one of the three times she walked passed us. The food itself was bland and the night ended with the waitress giving us a chipper fairwell. I guess she expected a night of rudeness would be rewarded with a good tip. She also forgot to give me my debit card back and I had to go back to retrieve that which was annoying.

It took a long time for my drink order to get to me from the bar, but when it did come, the manager brought it and apologized for the wait (I hadn't even asked about the drink yet!). The waiter wasn't 100% on-point, because I asked for some extra chips after finishing with the ones in the Spinach and Artichoke Dip appetizer (to finish the dip), and we didn't GET the chips until after dinner AND me asking again.  I'm pretty sure it was the waiter who forgot because after I reminded him, they came out of the kitchen within 5 minutes.

2,Mikey H.,"San Diego, CA",352,821,2768.0,4.0,2014-01-06,"Our flight home was cancelled, and we were stuck in Newark, New Jersey.  We didn't know the area but when we couldn't get out on Saturday, I looked for a new hotel to stay at that was close to anything within walking distance.  We found this Applebee's at The Outlet Collection: Jersey Gardens. There was a little confusion at the host stand, but the hostess said 15 minutes, and it was actually 5.  We were given a table by the bar and in front of the kitchen doors, so we got to see the food coming out.  Some of it looked really good and some just average.  Our server, Ibn, stopped by and said he'd be with us shortly.  I didn't realize how deep the restaurant went.   We ordered two glasses of the Shiraz and fried mozzarella sticks.  It had been a while since we've eaten these gooey fried sticks that are not good for you but hey, we're still on vacation.  We also asked if they sold the wines by the bottle.  The only red we could get was a Cabernet by Cupcake.  I've seen this label, and the $30 price tag seemed steep considering you could buy this at Trader Joe's or Costco for much less, but we wanted wine!  I don't think people order bottles at Applebee's because our server said he'd never opened a bottle before.  The bartender ended up doing it for him. He: I'm just going to make a mess, so I'm going to leave it here for you. Luckily I still remember my food service skills...LOL!  I ordered the Napa Chicken and portobellos.  It is a very healthy dish with zucchini, purple onions, and red bell peppers.  I just wished the mushrooms were sauteed longer.  The partner had the honey peppered sirloin which was tender and easy to cut.  We did have to wait awhile for that bottle to arrive, but again, I don't think most people order bottles. Overall, it was a very nice dining experience.  A couple of the managers came by to ask how everything was.  Did we look like corporate?  LOL!  I can see how things can get a little chaotic, but all the workers we encountered were friendly.  We didn't encounter anything the other reviewers experienced.  Maybe we had their best server.  With not that many choices for us to walk to, this Applebee's was worth coming to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=20,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096

Our server didn't write down our order and she claimed she didn't cause she was good at her job. She didn't give us plates or napkins for our appetizer sampler. The patron margarita tasted like water. My sizzling fajita skillet was cold and not sizzling. My fried wanted fries and mashed pots with his honey chicken and shrimp and she didn't bring it out like that! Maybe if she would of wrote it down she wouldn't of forgot! She forgot my guacamole and my wraps. Kim also charged me for the guac after not recieving it! I had to eat it like that cause she took so long. She didn't bring us refills after being asked. She brought out our brownie with NO ice cream!! And no spoons. I'm a Applebee's employee but in another location and I expected better service then this !! She was very slow and forgot us and her other tables were also complaining about her. I love going out to eat but this place needs to retrain or hire new servers and cooks ASAP!

6,Jennifer H.,"Rochester, NY",40,57,48.0,1.0,2014-04-15,"For me, Applebee's is the abusive relationship of restaurants. He/She doesn't treat you right, none of your friends understand what you see in him/her, and you always walk away promising yourself you'll never go back.... And then you're stuck in a mall when you stomach rumbles...and you think to yourself ""Maybe it's changed...maybe it really wasn't so bad"" So you go back. And, true to form, the food leaves you with a figurative ""black eye"". I don't like Applebees. Why do I do this to myself? Alas, the above ""Mall stomach rumble"" scenario happened to me while at the Jersey Garden's mall. I thought I would stop in for a better quality lunch than what one typically finds in the food court. And, thus, my first Yelp 1 star dining experience ensued.... As other posts noted, the hostess was fine. Greeted me courteously, seated me promptly. All was right with the world. Then, the fun began. I was seated next to the service station. Not across from, not a few tables away from....NEXT to the serving station. Imagine my surprise when it took quite some time for the server to recognize I was sitting in his section. Aside from the time it took to get noticed, the service as fine. The real blow came with the food. I ordered a lunch combo of the Fiesta Chopped Chicken Salad, and the Artisan Grilled Chicken Ciabatta. Now, I think most people that know me know I eat just about anything, and really don't complain. Let this be the lens with which you view this next statement. They were both TERRIBLE! (Charles Barkley/Taco Bell style TURRIBLE:  ).  The salad nearly blew my tastebuds out, in a bad way! Normally I like really flavorful food, but this was so bad I wondered if Ashton Kutcher was going to pop out to tell me I was being Punk'd. The salad looked like it was dressed with the bottom portion of an Italian Dressing bottle - you know, all the little bits and pieces...and then had tons of oil. I almost took a picture to prove my point, but I didn't think the image would come out. As for the sandwich - pray tell, what exactly qualifies it to receive the ""Artisan"" title? It looked like a Chik Fil-A sandwich. As for the condiments on the sandwich. I like to imagine the cook had an arm injury that made it too difficult to spread the condiments across the entire sandwich. That is honestly the only explanation. Avoid this place. Applebee's doesn't really love you, despite what it might say. It's going to fall back into the same old pattern, and there's only so many times you can use the ""I hit my eye on a cupboard"" excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-elizabeth?start=20,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004

I give it 20/10 stars. And my boyfriend had the 4 cheese w/ chicken tenders and my god that was to die for.

We have had bad experiences at other Apple Bee's locations and thought it was just that particular one. Nope, my theory is that all Apple Bee's are crumbling down. This place is located inside the Jersey Gardens Mall. When we went to this place it was around lunch time. It wasn't busy at all but the service was slow. The servers took a while to take our drink orders and then when they finally did we had to wait a while for the food to come out. I don't mind waiting for good food but it tasted like frozen food and reheated. I ordered the steak, vegetables, and mash potatoes. The steak was chewy and the vegetables was very bland.

My server kept checking on me and the status of my meal and apologizing even though it was out of his control. By the time my meal came to me, my party had finished eating.

I sat at the bar and the bartender, Tashiona, was sweet, proper, and fast. I gave her my order, she left me my check, and I closed my tab out immediately.

Salad was full of wilted lettuce, and small bugs flying around it. Wasn't even correct salad. Advised server and she swapped salad out. It was correct second time around. Server is very pleasant, although not frequent. Music is loud and obnoxious, can't hear people talking at your own table. So if you want to come alone and eat, it's perfect.
