Taylor C.,"Mebane, NC",0,4,,1.0,3/1/2015,"Terrible service, and food. The steak was chewy and the chicken tortilla soup had no chicken. They can't even put together a grilled cheese sandwich. Definitely would not recommend eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2?start=20
lars h.,"Orlando, FL",0,204,24,4.0,7/17/2013,"well, we experienced a totally different restaurant  than the other reviewers. first, the food was fine. it is a chain restaurant, so expect less than top of the line.  second, service. very nice waitress and quick service. we will stop again, if in transit through the area. applebees definitely got the job done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2?start=20
Christoph G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",70,1,,1.0,12/18/2010,"We ate here on a Saturday.  We were rafting that day and we're hungry so this was the ""best"" option ad there are not many places here.  They were backed up.    The waitress said the kitchen was backed up when we sat down which was a nice heads up. It then went down hill.  Our appetizer came out cold.  The waitress said there was nothing she could do about and If we wan we could talk to the manager.   45 minutes later we received our meals and our first refill.  She didn't even take out empty glasses ad another waitress finally grabbed them 15 minutes later.    We had to constantly ask for refills.  Out burgers were not coined even close to how we asked and the fries were cold.   The manager gave us a basket of hot fries and took the appetizer off the check.  It took 2 hours from the time we sat down to getting our checks which also took forever.   We should have went to Wendy's instead or drive to another gown!  Bypass this restaurant while on 19!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2?start=20
Bev D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,3.0,10/1/2017,"We stopped for some soup. That's all I could eat today. They were out of Tomato Basil soup. However, they were nice enough to give us our drinks complimentary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
Brandon S.,"Essex, MD",26,157,153,1.0,7/31/2015,"I'm really giving this place credit for one star. Truthfully, they deserve less. On a weekend trip to West Virginia for a family reunion, we stopped in a familiar restaurant for dinner. Being from Baltimore, Maryland I can assure you I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Usually, I don't complain much for poor service and subpar food. But for the first time in a verrryyyyyyy long time, Applebee's pissed me off.  It all started when we pulled into the lot. A red flad was when 8 employees were outside on their phones and smoking next to a side door. I thought it was unprofessional and thought of my teenage years when I was a bus boy and they didn't allow smoking anywhere near customers. When we walked in the front door their was not a hostess. We waited a good 5 minutes but eventually the hostess got off her smoke break to seat us.  I noticed something odd. All the wait staff were wearing beer shirts.... Our waitress came to take a drink order. My mother and father in law ordered a blue moon draft. But they couldn't enjoy it right away. You see, they had to go to the hotel to get their ID. Clearly older then 21. But that's not the biggest issue because law and policy reigns supreme. They came back with their IDs and along came our other drinks as well. I watched my father in law take a sip of his blue moon and make a funny face. ""Taste this,"" he exclaimed. After a quick sip it was clear the draft lines are dirty and the beer tasted the same. But we didn't complain.... They took our order and the wait begun! But when asked for Mac and cheese the waitress said ""it's Kraft so it's the good stuff."" Mind = blown 30 minutes later our salads came. Mine was 40% rotten lettuce. I ate what I could and then couldn't stomach anymore. See pictures. My in law was given his French onion soup and it was halfway filled with a tiny piece of cheese. See picture. After we stated the disappointment, they comped the soup and salad. 20 minutes later come the main course. 3 steaks cooked with with ice cold uncooked carrots. I had a order of honey barbecue wings. I took one bite and noticed it was rotten chicken. But at this point I was so irritated I told myself I wouldn't say anything. But when the the waitress seen the uneaten wings, I couldn't lie.  She told the manager and a young, douche bag manager comes over to tell me that the wings are fresh everyday and that nothing is wrong with them. Again, I'm not a person that ever complains this bad! But wow.... Just wow. He told me that he already comped my salad and he can't comp anymore. Well thank you mr. Douche bag manager with your sears button up shirt. It was so nice of him to give me a free brown salad with complimentary rotten lettuce. I simply told him I'll pay for it and it's a small price to pay compared to getting sick.  This was truly the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Two other tables around me complained of poor service and long waits for food. I could go on and on with the horrible service, food and atmosphere Applebee's in Summerville, WV provided.  I was so irritated that I gabbed my tired son and waited in the car for the rest to try and finish their horrible meals. When I was out there I snapped a pic of these horrible cooks and wait staff smoking outside. I watched one of them go back in a deliver someone's food Straight from smoking. When the family came back outside they couldn't even finish their meals. Another couple in the parking lot was on the phone filing a complain with their corporate offices. But to end this horrible review with a cherry on top I must share one last thing. When they were walking out and said goodbye to the waitress, she told them she just got out of jail for drugs. Ok... One word to describe this Applebee's. HORRIBLE",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2

Amanda S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",146,13,2,1.0,9/28/2016,"Holy crap this place was awful. Not even busy took forever to order, forever to get drinks, and forever to get food.

John P.,"Raleigh, NC",0,48,,1.0,5/4/2017,"Took forever for the bartender - who was chatting interminably with the wait staff - to draw a couple of beers. Only mediocre food, or worse.

Normally Applebees is a go-to place when we are traveling but the Summersville WV location has gone WAY downhill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
Geana A.,"Staten Island, NY",1,15,5,4.0,8/1/2017,"Came in service was fast, but it was interesting that some of the items we wanted to order were sold out for the evening and we came in at 8pm.  They were out of baked potato, my son wanted a certain steak but they were out of that which I get they only cut a certain amount for the day and when your out our out but a potato seriously? Kudos to the server that denied an underage table's order for alcohol.  The table tried and tried to get him to serve them but he didn't give in.  I wish I had gotten his name he did jump in for a moment when our waitress was on break and asked us if we needed anything. Management you need to give him positive feedback for standing his ground. This was on Sunday 7/30 evening we came and sat in the large booth upon entering the restaurant to the left and the table that was asking for alcohol was about 2 booths down maybe you can look up whose table that was that night being it was about the start of happy hour and he knew his menu and prices for happy hour forwards and backwards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
Ted W.,"Bondville, VT",0,29,7,1.0,7/30/2016,"Well when I arrived to summersville I asked about the local restaurants and specifically asked about the Applebee's here.  I was told that it is a hit or miss.  One day at lunch I thought I will give it a try.  On the door there was a note that the internet is not working and since the net is important to me I went somewhere else. This evening I thought I will outsmart that chance and called asking ""Does your internet working tonight?""  The hostess said ""I think it does...""  Well I asked if she can check.  It took literally some 10 minutes and she finally came back and said ""Yes it does"". Great I thought I did good.  I went there happily set the waitress came.  The waitress was pretty short and rude but I needed to work, they had the Net, so I ordered my beer and connected.   The beer arrived the waitress was still rude but I will have an internet connection, I can live with the rudeness of the waitress I gotta do some work...  The hourglass kept spinning the screen kept staring at me.  After some 10 minutes I realized that the net will not arrive  The Brewster kept looking at me I looked at it Asked for the bill paid and left.   No I didn't eat at Applebee's Summersville, experiencing the poor care and service I got so far I would hate to see what they would do to the piece of the caw I didn't order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
Frank G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",18,10,,2.0,9/18/2016,"Stopped here on way home from Georgia. It was a late Sunday afternoon, there were less than 7 guests, the place was dirty, the bathrooms were disgusting with toilets overflowing. We asked for decaf coffee and were told that they don't have a pot, will have to brew in an open container, not sure what that means, but we did get decaf coffee.  Food and service was average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2

JR B.,"Dundalk, MD",4,2,4,1.0,7/31/2015,"To start, my Blue Moon draft was nasty. They must not sell much of it here, because it's obvious that the draft line was STALE AS H3LL! I tasted my stepdaughter's Bud Light draft and it was crisp and clean. I Well, everyone's appetizers came out except for my French Onion Soup. They did, without prompting, comp it. However, when it did come out, it looked like they scraped it from the bottom of the pot and didn't fill half the bowl. My son-in-law's salad was chock full of brown lettuce. The entrees come out. My son-in-law's chicken wings were nearly rotten and inedible. My and my girlfriend's vegetables were so raw and hard slamming the fork into them most of the time didn't help. Me and my stepdaughter ordered the shrimp and parmesan sirloin. The parmesan ""sauce"" could have been used to flavor about 15 of these meals. It was so salty and powerful, it was like they used a undiluted concentrate. Stay the f$ck away!  As a side note, the waitress was bragging how good the mac-n-cheese was because it was made by Kraft.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
Evette L.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,4,,4.0,8/30/2014,"This Applebee's has my vote for 5 star service! I went with my 2 teens on a Friday evening while we were traveling. The place was crowded. When we walked in, I asked the waitress how long the wait would be. She said ""10-15 minutes"". We went outside, sat on the bench and started to settle in. 3 minutes later, she came out and told us our table was ready. Already they had exceeded my expectations. Once seated, our waitress, Ruth, came to the table, introduced herself and took our drink and appetizer orders. The orders came out quickly and the kids enjoyed the mozarella sticks. After a short wait, before we even had a chance to worry that our meals were missing, Ruth came over to say the food would be out in a few minutes. 5 minutes later she came back and apologized for the wait. Next, the manager came over and apologized for the wait. (We were still fine with the wait time). He said that as the chef was plating my daughter's grilled salmon, they dropped the salmon on the floor. They were in the process of cooking a fresh piece for her. Again, he apologized and told us they would send the food out as soon as it was ready. Shortly, the food came out! My son loved the quesadilla burger and my daughter thought her salmon was perfect! My meal was good.We all appreciated Ruth's friendliness and attentiveness. She had perfect timing fir refilling the drinks. When Ruth brought our bill to the table, she told us the manager had deducted the cost of salmon, because of the wait! I was especially impressed, because they had profusely apologized so many times  and my daughter had really enjoyed the salmon. The gesture was above and beyond, but very much appreciated. My son, having worked in a restaurant for more than a year was adamant that I give Ruth a great tip, because she did everything right. Even more impressive than his cajoling me  into giving a 63% tip, was the fact that he went into his own pocket and added another $10 on top of that. He said that Ruth did such a great job he wanted to make her day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
Addie A.,"Elkins, WV",0,9,,1.0,4/15/2016,Gave it one more try.... Counted 10 dirty tables and the waitresses were sitting with customers chatting and eating.

Jeremy M.,"Chapel Hill, NC",56,11,,2.0,3/29/2015,Very slow.  Came in around 11am Sunday morning and there were maybe three others in the restaurant.  We had six in our party but didn't order anything special.  The food was ok.  There aren't many choices in Summersville so I guess this is an ok place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2

Mike P.,"Rock Hill, SC",3,5,3,2.0,12/3/2013,"I would have given this 3 stars if it hadn't been for the slow service.  I had the honey pepper sirloin and it was delicious.  My complaints are that it took 15 minutes after I had been seated before anyone asked me what I wanted for dinner.  I asked if I could get a beer and she said oh,  of course you can then took my drink order and dinner.  Didn't ask if I wanted an appetizer.  I ordered a salad and it came out after about 10 minutes,  before the beer ever came out.  When I got the bill I was charged for a 9oz steak when I ordered a 7oz.  In Fairness to them it looked like a 9 oz.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
Bruce E.,"Markham, Canada",8,21,,3.0,7/15/2014,Food was good.   What was weird was this: the servers did not come and remove our plates as they were finished.   Table became too cluttered!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
Luke T.,"Columbus, OH",979,819,491,2.0,8/14/2010,"Already a bit discontent that we were running behind to get on the road, my mood was only made worse when we opted for Applebee's. Not a lot of options in Summersville as far as food is concerned, but fast food with a 50% ""we bring it to your table"" upcharge wasn't really better than Taco Bell or Long John Silver's, in my opinion.  Initially, when the waitress refilled my sweet tea (an obscurity in Columbus) almost instantly, I thought this might not be so bad. However, our food took forever to come out. Our check took even longer. The mixed vegetables that came with my meal were clearly of the frozen variety, as is 90% of the food served, I'm sure. The beer selection was deplorable, Sam Adams being the only thing remotely close to a microbrew. To make matters worse, I kept getting stared at because of my being a weirdo covered in tattoos. Not by the staff, but the other bar patrons. That's negative points on the atmosphere scale. If you absolutely must be waited on with a tip expected, then this is an option. Not necessarily a good one, but an option. If you aren't kingly and don't mind walking your food to your own table, then I'd recommend other fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-summersville-2
