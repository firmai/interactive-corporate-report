And it comes with cantaloupe as well as steak fries, so on my good days I can skip the fries and fill the corners with the cantaloupe, and on my bad days I can enjoy the crispy fries. Hubby and I usually go during happy hour (5-7, M-Th), to take advantage of the drink and appetizer specials.    Oh, and if you want to avoid the kiddies, ask to sit in the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=20,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

It was ""magician night"" although I never saw a magician. There was no wait for a table but I have never seen so many empty dirty tables in any restaurant at one given time. In all, there were maybe a dozen active tables. We ordered the Tavern Burgers and my son actually wanted more of the bottomless fries however our waitress, Dakota never bothered to come back so we did not even get refills on our drinks. The food was delivered by someone else and we never saw our waitress other than her taking the order and bringing the check. We had planned to get desert but skipped it due to poor service, why stay longer? Anyway, the food was ok but was much better at the other location. I am certain that we will not ever bother to return to this location again.

I felt the menu was very limited in selection and I wish they had more of a variety such as chicken tenders, salads, etc. I remembered going a few years ago and they had chicken tenders on their menu. Not anymore. I was disappointed, so I ordered plain burger, and I was less than impressed. My burger didn't have any flavor and I felt like it wasn't cooked medium well. I thought it was burnt on the outside and my burger looked rare or medium rare. There was not an ounce of seasoning in that burger. Major no-no from me. The fries were not seasoned either.

Today was no exception. There are always plenty of business people here, which can be a little weird sometimes since I have my one-year-old always in tow.  Today my son behaved pretty darn well (at least no screaming, which is always a good goal). He left a slew of cheerios everywhere, but our waitress, Shannon, said it came with the territory and not to worry about it. When someone I assume was the manager came to see how we were doing, I apologized to her for the mess, and she said there were plenty of people she had to take care of it. They were both very nice. Our meals were great, and Shannon even brought an extra piece of bread with my salad when I said my son would just eat my bread. Our drinks were never empty, and several people stopped by to see how we were doing throughout the meal. The true above-and-beyond service came when I left my childless friend with my son and bolted to the bathroom. He's at that age where he has a bit of separation anxiety, and he panicked when I left. Not only did no one complain (I was pretty darn fast), but Shannon even sat down and played peek-a-boo to help my friend out while I was gone. It was a very nice lunch, and I'm glad this is where we usually pick to meet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=20,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005
39,Alex T.,"Livonia, MI",34,235,5.0,5.0,2013-01-18,"Red Robin has been one of my favorite restaurants in Novi since it opened in Novi about 20 years ago. Yes it is a chain, and with that in mind, there isn't much better.  Red Robin consistently serves up an excellent burger.  One that is balanced in both flavor and size.  My favorite is the Royal Red Robin Burger w/o mayo. The steak fries are awesome...my favorite after Five Guys and Penn Station.  The fact that they're bottomless makes things even better.  Just sprinkle some of Red Robin's special seasoning blend on them and you're good to go. Since Novi isn't exactly the place to find great local eateries, I highly recommend Red Robin. One last thing.  Since this location is on the older side, I think it has a much better atmosphere.  Most of the new ones are laid out in one big rectangle with minimal walls dividing different seating areas.  This restaurant has many different ""rooms"" separated with lots of walls and props.  It really adds to the feel when compared to the newer design.  When I think about it more, it must have been in order to divide the smoking section from the rest of the place before the smoking ban.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=20,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001

Seating wasn't really an issue here, luckily! While the food that was received was delicious, it did take some of us over an hour to get our meals after we ordered. To me, this is a bit excessive, even with a large group of people.  My biggest complaint would be that of the management on 6/27/13 from 8:30-10:30pm. Within our large group, 2 ordered were lost in translation, which was fine by us...because mistakes happen. While the 2 meals were comped and deserts were offered to those 2 customers...the manager on duty (female, blonde hair) was highly unprofessional about the situation. While we have no idea what actually happened behind closed doors, we did see that the manager yelled/spoke down to/reprimanded the waitress right in front of us. BIG NO-NO!  In a nutshell..

First off: if you are a garlic fan, ALWAYS opt for the garlic parmesan french fries. They are my favorite part about Red Robin's menu. They have sweet potato fries now which are also very good (and not steak fries either, which surprised me) but the garlic ones are my fave. I did the build your own chicken sandwich, which was a good deal - $7.99 (and 49c extra for the fries) for a sandwich with pickles and BBQ sauce. I like that they have a cheaper option now because I usually don't get cheese and all that stuff on my sandwich anyways.  Service was fine although a little slow at times and rushed at others.

29,Pete S.,"El Paso, TX",0,7,,2.0,2016-04-22,"First time and last time I will come here. It isnt necessarily the price or the food as Ive dropped 150-200 on a meal for two several times without batting an eye, it was all about the expectations here.  When I saw several items on the menu had the ""bottomless"" concept, I thought it was pretty interesting. The catch, however, was the initial bottomless fries was small portion, then when I asked for a refill, it took 15-20 minutes to get it. One would think a restaurant with this concept would have plenty prepared ahead of time and make the fast refills a priority. I just had a feeling of being lied to and cheated. Second, the regular size burgers were one of the smallest Ive ever seen at a dine-in restaurant. It is basically the size of a Mcdouble with some toppings. The plate that was brought to me looked pathetic, seemed like a fast calibre meal and not a gourmet burger joint. The place had decent amount of people, I guess they must like something about it, it just wasnt for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-novi?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

Stop in at lunch time and the place is always at least half empty. The service is painfully slow - not sure if it is the kitchen, the waitstaff or both.

19,Keisha L.,"Riverview, FL",0,40,29.0,2.0,2016-11-23,"This was my second time at this location. I simply wanted a small order of the bottomless fries.  The young lady at the front door greeted and directed me to the bar to place a carry out order. And that is where my issue begins. Typically when you sit at the bar or even at a table, the server greets you and ask for your drink order. Welp.....that was not the case. The bartender, Marc, was standing at the counter counting money from his drawer. This was fine, because I assume this was necessary at the moment. So I sat down and waited.....and waited.....and waited......AND waited. FYI: I'm very patient. No acknowledgement, no eye contact, no welcome to Red Robin, can I get you a drink or menu? Nothing!!  So eventually I was greeted, just not be Marc.  A lady came to the bar area and asked me was I a particular customer here to pick up a carry out. When I stated that I wanted to place an order, she gave me a menu and said ""oh, he will help you with that.""  Marc leaves the area as I look over the menu. He returns and stands by the cash register looking in my direction as if to say hurry up and make up your mind. I place my order, I ask a question, he stares at me and half answers, he gives me my check. Another couple comes in and sits to the left of the bar, directly behind. Good Ole Friendly Marc walks over to their table and says ""Hey guys how's it going. My name is Marc or you can call me super awesome like everyone else does *pause....they all laugh......What can I get for you guys to drink? So I'm thinking, so he is capable of a proper greeting. And here I was thinking I needed to lower my expectations. This was a very poor representation of Red Robin and a great example of what customer service should not look like. Needless to say WE will not be returning to the bar area as long as Marc is doing what he does best.

They sat us right by the kitchen door and that was a real show. I saw/heard more than I needed to. I'm not the fun police and I think everyone should be able to enjoy their jobs, but flipping off your coworker in front of customers or loudly telling an inappropriate story left me feeling like no one really cared about their jobs. Our waiter was very nice and attentive but when he asked how we liked our burgers cooked and we said ""rare"" he told us they had to cook them to a certain internal temperature. So why even ask? They came out well done. There was barely any arugula on mine so I asked for more. I was brought a greasy cup of arugula with grease also on the pieces on top. Who put that in a cup?? Why would he bring it out like that?? My burger was also really greasy and before long, there was a sizable puddle of grease on my plate.

The last two times we visited, about 4 months in between, we waited at the front entrance to be greeted. Both times, after 5 minutes of not being acknowledged, we walked out. They really need to fire the entire management team and start over. We have never had a bad experience at the Brighton Red Robin or other locations, but this one sucks.

I had already decided not to frequent the Red Robin in Westland because of multiple negative experiences there, but I did not understand that bad service is a franchise wide problem not a local problem. After waiting for our group to be seated for an hour an a half, the hostess and staff took their time cleaning the tables that had been empty for a while and didn't even clean enough tables to seat our whole group. When I let the hostess know that these were not enough seats for our party and asked if the tables adjacent could be cleaned so we could all sit, she became angry and kept repeating ""so your party is more than 20 people then?"" Even though the tables they cleared for us DID NOT fit 20 people in the first place, she kept repeating ""so your party is more than 20 people then?"" as if we were making outrageous demands by asking to have enough tables and chairs for everyone to be seated after waiting AN HOUR AND A HALF. I asked to talk to the manager and although she was trying to be more polite than her employee, it was clear she did not care about the terrible treatment we had experienced. A number of us left after this. After this experience I am DONE with Red Robin as a franchise. It cannot be a coincidence that I have had such bad experiences with them at multiple locations.
