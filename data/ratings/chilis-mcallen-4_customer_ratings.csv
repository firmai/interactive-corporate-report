12,Ace T.,"McAllen, TX",12,26,,3.0,2012-04-24,"Chili's is pretty good chain food.  Their drink specials are not bad, and the bar tends to fill up quickly.  The food is consistent, wait staff is generally friendly, overall a good place to eat and have a drink or two.  Fun fact - their chili, the namesake dish, is actually really good.  Try a cup with a side of Texas cheese fries and some southwestern eggrolls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
10,Robert R.,"Edinburg, TX",1,19,3.0,2.0,2014-03-13,"It's just not what it used to be. Chilis has always been one of the places to go when I want a good meal that it is a sure thing. Today their food tastes too commercial. With the exception of their burgers, other dishes I have tried taste like they have just been heated up in the kitchen rather than actually cooked on site. It tastes good but not good enough to have to wait for a table, then wait for a long time for your food to get served. There are other options out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
11,Lilly E.,"McAllen, TX",0,5,2.0,1.0,2015-05-05,"Been here several times and this is the last time I go. The service is horrible all the time. We went to celebrate my mom's birthday and after our meal, we had to get the hostess to get our server (he kept disappearing for a long time) so that we could order the cake.   After waiting for him for about 30 min. and finally ordering the cake... he actually made a face like he was upset that we werenot finished. Trust me, we were very polite to him because we wanted a pleasant experience for my mom.  Didnt even bother to speak to a manager since he was not around, Hope my comment helps. Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
8,Richard G.,"Austin, TX",0,3,9.0,4.0,2015-07-11,Good vibes. Food is good and the service is awesome. Really enjoy coming here. Chocolate lovers need to get the Chocolate Molten for dessert. It's amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
6,Rene C.,"McAllen, TX",79,69,38.0,4.0,2016-03-06,Been here several times and the staff are always friendly. On a packed night they usually say it will take 20-30 mins but usually sit you after 10 mins. No long wait. Everything I've had here is really good. A must try are the rib eye tacos. The meat was so tender and super juicy although in my opinion it did not really seem like rib eye. Meat was more like carne guisada.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
9,Blanca G.,"Edinburg, TX",0,15,1.0,3.0,2016-07-25,"We stopped by because we wanted quick service since parking lot was practically empty. When we arrived, the host wasn't quickly available but when she got there she quickly sat us . She was our waitress as well and when we asked for a coffee, it wasn't fresh,when asked , she went to make a new cup of coffee . She took our order, chips came out quick , food came out soon after and was delicious!! One of the things that I didn't see right is that the host had to take care of us and 3 other tables while other waitresses were standing around . Every once in a while we would see another waitress helping out another table. I think that they should've had more waitresses working on the floor so that our stay would've been shorter instead of having to wait so long to get the check. Our host/waitress did a great job!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
7,Gerry R.,"Coronado, CA",27,4,7.0,3.0,2016-11-11,"I am a huge Chili's fan. It's probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. The food is consistently good, and they are one of the few restaurants where the waiters will customize an order easily with a smile on their face. This specific Chili's, however has been consistently disappointing for the past year. The food is still great, but the service is poor. The hostess is never to be found, and it takes a very long time for a simple drink order to be taken. Most of my visits to this particular Chili's result in a waiter from another section eventually noticing my neglected table and coming to take my order. It's incredibly frustrating considering the food and environment are always great. When visiting this particular Chili's, prepare yourself for the poor service, or decide on a different restaurant or a Chili's elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
5,Mariana P.,"McAllen, TX",13,3,4.0,5.0,2017-01-20,"This Chilis serves some of the most incredible food I have ever tried. Most of these reviews are people complaining about the waiters and waitresses, but if you're looking for a good, delicious meal, this is where to go. Try the Big Mouth Bites, or the Chicken Crispers (Honey Chipotle). They're delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
2,Mauro P.,"Pharr, TX",66,47,317.0,4.0,2017-01-21,"Chilis is one our favorite places to dine at.  Love the taste, the portions and the prices. Came in for lunch and had their ""2 for $22"" which offer awesome meal choices.  The way it works is:  1). Choose an appetizer to share. Some our usual choices are the Chips and Guacamole or the Texas Cheese Fries. 2).  Choose an entre. Personal favorites are the Chile-Mango Chicken, Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers and the Cajun Pasta. We always have water instead of Flavors drinks.  Our bill came out to be around $26 including tip which is fair due to the Taste, Portions and Service.   Would really recommend for both lunch and dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
3,Vero S.,"McAllen, TX",14,33,105.0,4.0,2017-05-16,Good dessert and coffee... didn't know they had coffee :) Happy to be celebrating my bday all week!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
1,Regino G.,"McAllen, TX",827,248,1315.0,4.0,2017-06-27,I had lunch here a few times during my work breaks. I was surprised to see their healthy meal options since I have been on a diet. I usually order the margarita chicken dish which is very good with a side asparagus!  The service is usually OK but I try to be understanding since I usually go during lunch and this is their busiest time of the day and the waiters are simply trying to keep up with all the people.  I recommend this restaurant as a good lunch option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
4,Robert G.,"Arlington, TX",0,6,7.0,4.0,2017-08-13,"Had a wonderful lunch at this particular Chili's  today.  Food was on point!  The salad was very fresh and crisp !  I had the Mango chili chicken which was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  This would have been a perfect experience if the waitress would have been more attentive.   Our waitres, ""Ashley"", took our and was never seen again.  I had to ask a passing waiter for assistance.   Food was AMAZING!  Yay for GREAT COOKS at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcallen-4,,,,,
