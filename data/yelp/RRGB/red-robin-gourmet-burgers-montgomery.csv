Alexa H.,"Talbot's Corner, Nashville, TN",176,5,,3.0,12/5/2017,Tried to order three different beers and they were all out. Food was ok. Servers were very nice and apologized multiple times for their lack of drinks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery

Kat D.,"Atlanta, GA",78,149,196,3.0,7/20/2016,"The service was great!  My server, Alexa, was very energetic, happy, and helpful.  I came for lunch right after they opened (just after 11 am).  There were hardly any people there so our food came out in less than 15 minutes. If it wasn't for Alexa's service, this review would only have 2 stars.   I was highly dissatisfied with the food.  I expected to have an exceptional burger since that's Red Robin's specialty.  I had the guacamole burger.  It was so flavorless!  And for $11 I was very disappointed.  My husband had the boneless wings appetizer as his meal and felt it was mediocre.  His was also around $11 plus a couple bucks to add fries.  That plus drinks and a tip, I spent much more than I wanted to, especially for a flavorless lunch.  The restaurant seemed clean overall, however the bathroom shows this location's age.  Bathroom could definitely benefit from a makeover.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery

Damian W.,"Pike Road, AL",6,134,,1.0,3/26/2017,"I don't like writing this review because I love Red Robin. I was really excited when we moved here because we were going to live so close to one. The first time I came here in 2014, it was fine. Every time since, the service has been abysmal! Tonight, it took 20 minutes for our 2 beers to arrive. Then when I asked what the hold up was, our server gave me an attitude about it!!! Then, one of our orders was wrong. We had to get the management involved. Sad to say it but this will be our last time here. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery
Bailey N.,"San Antonio, TX",54,240,82,2.0,3/14/2016,"I am usually a huge fan of RR restaurants. I think their burgers are the best! However, the RR here in Montgomery has issues.  I've lived in town for about three years, and I've been to this location A myriad of times. The last six months, however, something has changed at this restaurant. Every server seems like they hate their job. Service is not good.  My last two trips here have been less than impressive. On our most recent visit, we ordered a short stack of onion rings as an appetizer. They came out after our burgers. At one point, I saw a server walking towards us with our short stack of onion rings, looking confused. I guess he decided he didn't know where the order was supposed to go, so he turned around and went back to the kitchen. They did not come out for another 10 minutes.  Our server was not very attentive. Whatever has happened at this location, has to be management related. Kind of sad. Can I just add a personal note? I absolutely hate that these restaurants have gone to the little electronic console at the tables. Part of what I tip you for is for you to take my card from me, run it, and return it. Having me pay my own bill at the table, just lessens your tip. The service industry at restaurants has gotten so lazy! And these people want $15 an hour. It's nuts!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery
Oriana S.,"Lakewood, WA",30,19,5,4.0,6/3/2017,Red Robins is AWESOME! I have always enjoyed Red Robins no matter what location it was in. Food was great as well as the garlic fries. My only complaint for this location is I wish I could have gotten refilled on the sweet tea and fries. Waiter was a bit slow. And my kids food came out on the cold side instead of warm/hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery
Scott M.,"Montgomery, AL",3,10,2,4.0,1/4/2017,"Was scared to come to this place because of bad reviews but you can't trust everything you read and hear. I remember coming to Red Robin's when I was a child and it was delicious. Was looking for a place to treat my girlfriend to while she was in town and I decided to stop here. Was immediately sat down, and served. The waitress was kind even when we was taking our time picking out some food to eat. The food took no less than 10 minutes to arrive at our table. The food, I must say was delicious. We both ordered chicken tenders and fries and it was out of this world. The chicken tenders were delicious, the fries were delicious but the coke I got wasn't all that. But overall, everything was great.

Kacey D.,"Prattville, AL",0,32,2,2.0,1/1/2017,"Mediocre and unsanitary.

Andrew W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,7,,2.0,7/27/2017,Prime rib dip pricey. Average at best. Not worth $4 more than a burger. Unlimited fries is a relative term. I think the plan is to slow roll you so that you give up or have to go to work. Been waiting at least 20 minutes. Took three tries to get an accurate check.

Welcome to low-class, unskilled, uneducated, ultra-high attrition rate Montgomery, Alabama.  It's close to the mall.... so people keep coming.  The servers could care less, the management could care less.  Within a week they will all likely quit, walk down the street and get another unskilled labor job. That's how it works here..... and you'll find this holds true for most of the ""chain"" restaurants near the Eastchase mall.  My family and I just simply stopped coming to all of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=20

I had a mushroom burger that was excellent and hubby had a great burger also.

They were steak fries too! They don't take too long to come out either. And they come out hot and fresh. My boyfriend and I also went to another location in Myrtle beach, SC. It was just as great.

Bruce N.,"Titus, AL",30,31,4,3.0,9/19/2015,"The service was great. Got seated immediately and the food was served promptly. The prices for the food was tremendously high though. I had the Prime Rib Dip and at over $14.00 for the plate, I was expecting to get full. Not happening. The sandwich was small and the bread was to hard to bite into. I had to fork it. I thought after I left that I could go right next door to Arby's and get the same thing, just about, for half the price and get more of it.  The Dipping Sauce for the ""Bottomless Fries"" was a joke. I ordered the Bacon Sauce and was brought a tiny plastic cup that resembled a coffee creamer container with what appeared to be a cream sauce with bacon it it. It was just taken out of the refrigerator so it was hard and I could not dip my fries into it. Again it had to be forked.  The wife ordered one of their Signature Burgers and she seemed pleased with it so there is a plus. Another plus is the Game Console at every table. It is a nice distraction for the outside world and a convenient was to pay the bill.  Over all - Good Service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=20

H C.,"Vienna, VA",1,39,15,2.0,11/21/2016,"I recently went there over the weekend. I order two burgers--one for dine in and one to go.  The burger I had for dining in was slightly over cooked. The burger I had to go was also over cooked and inedible. I don't know what they put on my to go order, but it tasted like bleach. After I bit into it and it tasted like bleach, I threw it away.  I live almost 2 hours from the nearest Red Robin, and was quite disappointed the burger I was excited to have at home wasn't even edible.  The facility was dirty. The bathroom sink was draining into a bucket. The bathrooms were worse than most truck stops.  The server was friendly, but not attentive. It wasn't busy when we went-maybe 4 families in there for dining in.  The staff was having a dance 'party' in the back, which was just not the atmosphere for it.  Overall this was and is not a place I would trust to eat at again. I'm actually quite disappointed the management has let this facility be run so poorly. The one in Panama City has much better food and staff.

Wendy K.,"Wetumpka, AL",10,10,13,2.0,9/3/2016,I'm very disappointed and quite surprised that the ramen burger tasted like it was cooked in urine. I had to return it and they gave me my money back. They offered something else but I was afraid to get anything else. I'm unsure if it was the sauce or the ramen itself but I asked our friend and my daughters and they said it smelled and tasted funny as well. I probably won't return now. That used to be one of my fav places to go. Also they didn't serve the fries in the chrome cups like before. I also asked for an Irish cream shake and the waitress had to come back 3 times to ask me what it was and how much it was. Then the bartender has to come and ask me for another time which one I wanted the stout shake or Irish cream and I was confused. Anyways when he filled the stout shake as it sounded better to me I couldn't taste any alcohol. It was like a regular milkshake lol! I'm going to try to make a ramen burger at home just to see if it tastes funny like it did there. I'll be pretty shocked if not.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=20
Sarah V.,"Montgomery, AL",218,190,142,1.0,8/8/2015,"Such horrible service. It took 20 minutes to be seated when there were plenty of tables available. We get seated in the bar area and it took another 10+ minutes for the waitress to take our drink order and she brings the wrong drinks.2 cokes a beer and a water and it was wrong. We ordered our burgers 2 out of the 4 were wrong and she never asked us how we wanted them cooked and they all came out medium well. My dad ordered another beer and the manager brought it over after my dad asked, not even the bartender who could have easily helped the waitress.  The waitress came to check on us and we said we did not need more fries but she brought 3 trays of more fries and no refills like we asked. It was absolutely AWFUL!!!  The only reason I am giving 1 star is because my husband ordered a salted caramel shake as an appetizer (I had to taste) that was yummy and the chipotle sauce that you use to dip the sweet potato fries.

As I stood there waiting for a table, I saw several meals sit on the counter for over 10 minutes waiting to be served to their patrons.

Rustin L.,"Papillion, NE",94,114,51,2.0,9/7/2013,"So...it's Red Robin.  It's a national chain at which I've eaten in probably six or seven states across the country. What I mean to say is that there's a level of expectation for a chain that this one DID NOT meet. First it took too long to get seated when there was no rush, plenty of tables, no waiting list, and no one waiting to say Hello at the door (as per every other Red Robin). When we were finally seated, we were crowded into a small section with a bunch of other customers (no necessary) and the wait for service was HORRIBLE. I felt like we were forgotten. And once the order went it, it took way too long for the burgers to come out. Of note, and this applies to many Red Robins, when I ask for a basket of free fries when I place my first drink order, I expect it to show up right after we order our entrees, NOT AFTER when receive our burgers that have fries in the basket already.

Sean S.,"Montgomery, AL",6,3,,1.0,6/11/2014,May as well be in the Arctic with how cold it is kept in here. Food is what you expect service on the other hand is amazingly slow and deficient.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=40

Jed M.,"Villa Rica, GA",0,23,1,2.0,2/24/2013,"The burger was good, but the bartender was borderline rude. She acted like she was inconvenienced by me choosing to sit at the bar. Some bartenders and wait staff act like they don't understand that their tip is related to their service and attitude. A simple ""Hi"" when someone sits down (as opposed to looking up from washing glasses, seeing me sitting there, and then just looking back down again) goes a long way. Adding, ""I'll be with you in a minute"" is graduate-level and, sadly, a bridge too far for most wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=40
Asia W.,"Montgomery, AL",0,2,,1.0,4/28/2015,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here last night and I am thoroughly disappointed. This was my second time coming here in about 8 years or so. My first visit was pleasant from what I can remember. But last night's service was just god awful. For one, it took 10 minutes for us to put in a drink order. I got the Spanish Red Sangria (delish!) and my boyfriend got a double Crown NEAT (no ice, no nothin') and a Dr. Pepper on the side. It took about another 15 minutes for us to receive our drinks (keep in mind that this was a Monday night, not a Friday or Saturday night) and when they did finally arrive, his double Crown was on the rocks (apparently the bartender doesn't know what NEAT means). At that point, we were already pissed off and didn't want to waste time sending it back. Now, for the waiter. I don't know what this dude's problem was, but he made me feel very uncomfortable. For one, he got all in our faces when we ordered our drinks and food. By that, I mean that he crouched down, put his elbows on the table and was about 2 damn inches from our face. I backed away and he just kinda got closer, my boyfriend was not amused, nor was I. When he came to take our food order, he got extremely close to me, putting his elbows on the table and getting in my space. I had to kinda lean over to the inside of the booth so he wasn't so close to my face. When he finally brought our food 30 minutes after ordering, he asked us if we looked at the Rewards Program. I told him that I had signed up for it and he asks for my number (by this point my boyfriend is fuming and says ""No, you can't have her number, dude"") and I tell him that I have the code that was texted to me. He was like, ""oh, yeah, the code. Let me write that down"". Very inappropriate. The food was excellent, don't get me wrong, but the service that we experienced was just terrible. I don't think it's appropriate for a waiter to crouch down and be at face level when taking your order, at all. Not everyone likes to have their space invaded. Probably won't be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=40
TJ P.,"Millbrook, AL",10,24,23,4.0,1/19/2011,"I've had good experiences and bad experiences here.  Most of the bad ones dealt with either a sleepy waitress or other diners being obnoxious causing the police to be called by another diner (Yeah, that happened). The burgers and chicken sandwiches are as tasty as they look! However, the fries are hit or miss. Sometimes (when they are hot hot hot) they are to die for. But from time to time you'll get the lukewarm potato logs that just ruin your appetite.  I highly suggest the bottomless root beer floats. Mad delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=40

Kisente F.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,111,61,4.0,4/15/2013,"I love Red Robin burgers! My favorite burger is the Blue Ribbon Burger (medium rare). Be careful when trying to order your burgers well done.

Matt A.,"Montgomery, AL",1,20,,3.0,1/6/2011,"The first time I went, I thought it was hot stuff. But really, it's pretty much average now that I've been a few times. Nothing stand out to me.  It's not bad - but there's really nothing that gets me excited about this place. So for the price, not my first, second, or third choice.

Phoebe T.,"Marietta, GA",49,553,4,4.0,3/15/2010,"Came here with my brother, fiance, fiance's brother and fiance's brother's wife after a One Republic concert. I've been to the Red Robin in Houston, TX but not in Alabama yet. We walked in at 10:30PM, 30 minutes before closing. The hostess wasn't there so we waited about 2 minutes before she finished up her phone call and seated us. Didn't bother us too much - we were just worried they'd be closed! I'd have to say, the service here is pretty amazing. Our waters were always being re-filled, the fries were always being re-filled and our waitress even asked us if we wanted to take a water to go! The burgers were decent - I got the natural burger and I liked how the components of the burger weren't on the burger yet so the bun wasn't soggy =) Everyone seemed to enjoy their burgers and we were all full afterward. I'd have to say - I'm surprised to say that this Red Robin has amazing service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=60
Melissa T.,"Pasadena, CA",77,169,20,3.0,3/24/2010,"Red Robin has a great selection of burgers. Also if you're not a meat-eater, don't fret, they can substitute in a Boca burger in place of the meat patty for any of their burgers. They also offer turkey burgers, which are one of my favorites. Other than burgers, they offer unlimited steak fries (which are just okay) and a full bar.  We came here one night looking for a late dinner. Surprisingly, there were a few tables of customers despite the hour. The hostess thought she was off the clock already, since she completely ignored us when we came in. Eventually, we got seated to find a very attentive waitress. I'm not sure whether the waitress was bored or she was on Amphetamine (speed). No complaints about constantly filled glasses and an abundance of fries. The food was pretty standard for chain restaurants, it's okay. We were all very hungry and gobbled up everything nonetheless.  Overall, it was an interesting and tummy-filling experience at Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=60
Ed A.,"Montgomery, AL",2,56,1,3.0,7/1/2013,Noticed food under the hot lamp for 10 minutes and longer. Service not very good. Long wait and dried food. This appeared unusual for this Red Robin. I complained to the manager who explained the situation and made no excuses. The manager did the honorable thing and did not charge us. Because of the manager's honesty and good customer relations we will return. This was making lemonade out of lemons.
