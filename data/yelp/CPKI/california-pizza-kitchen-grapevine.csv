Bryant was on top of everything making sure we had everything we need, he had great suggestions, and he made sure we had a good time!

Madiha K.,"Dallas, TX",60,48,3,3.0,12/24/2017,"We ordered the Margherita, California Veggie and Five Cheese, with the latter two being the only ones I would recommend. The pizzas themselves were pretty good, they only come in one size that is enough for about 3 people. I also got the Mango Strawberry cooler which was refreshing and pretty to look at. This place is good for larger parties so that's why we picked it as our pizza destination...but with that being said the service sucks. I don't understand establishments that pride themselves on being good for big groups but then hire wait staff that resent any party above 4.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine

David V.,"Keller, TX",113,347,863,4.0,7/4/2016,"3.5 stars. This location is pretty nice. I like the wall to ceiling Windows, very bright, clean, modern atmosphere. The outside can be deceiving.  I've been to many other CPKs before and just never fell in love with their pizzas. Not sure what it is. I'm more of the whole in the wall, mom/pop store type of person when it comes to pizzas.  On the two occasions I've been to this one, the pizzas were alittle soggy. I've had the works, it was alright, a lot more veggies than I expected. And my friend introduced me to the spicy chicken chipotle. Wasn't bad either. I like the white sauce that comes with it.  What I haven't tried yet were their non pizza items, maybe I'll give them another try in the fututre. I saw some pretty good lunch deals on their website. Service has always been quick and friendly. Will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine
Michelle D.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/5/2017,"It took one hour to get our food and there were only 5 at our table. There were four small tables of people at the restaurant so it was not busy. There seemed to be plenty of employees in the building, probably about the same number as there were customers. It took another 30 min to get our bill! Crazy! Then there's the food.

Mackenzie J.,"Round Rock, TX",10,8,11,4.0,1/12/2017,"Pros: I have always absolutely adored CPK's pasta sauce. My family's vegan so pasta is always an easy option to find when we are traveling. The pasta sauce tastes very fresh, the humus platter is delicious, and the cauliflower bites are very spicy and pleasant. Cons: No matter which location we've went to CPKs are always very cold. They have an open kitchen and no separate systems or if they do they sure don't use them. At the most recent one it felt like no difference when we stepped outside (which was 57 degrees) Overall I love CPK but wish they would do something about the temperature.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine
Ashmi B.,"Arlington, TX",103,12,24,2.0,2/25/2017,I wanted to try this place out because of the hype I heard. They have good services for the first timers. They offered us a complementary white corn guacamole - it was good but nothing special. We ordered a California Veggie and a Roasted Artichoke pizza (mouth watering names right ? ). We had to wait a little longer than expected for the pizza to arrive - but I can wait surprisingly long time for amazing food. This one was surely NOT worth my wait. Nothing special about the pizzas or the crust. I would not go there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",602,677,1990,3.0,11/24/2015,"California Pizza Kitchen can either be really good, or very mediocre so read as 3.5 stars since it's not always consistent. I can't remember the last time I went to one, but I know it was at least 2 years ago. We were running errands in the area when our stomachs both growled yesterday, so we caved and figured why not?  It appears as though they may be trying to revamp the menu a bit. They were advertising new mojitos sweetened with agave and fresh mint that sounded yummy. They still have a lengthy list of wines as well which always pair nicely with Italian fare.  My husband ordered a beer and we started with their white bean hummus. It's served with your choice of traditional or whole wheat pita bread which they brought us piping hot out of the pizza oven. It was delicious! The only thing I didn't care for were the chunks of tomatos on top. Roasted red peppers I would understand but the combo of hummus and tomatoes didn't make sense to me.  They bring out complimentary bread and oil to the table also with herbs mixed in like rosemary, parsley, and red chili flakes for a subtle kick of heat. The bread was a tad crunchy for me because of recent dental work, but I hollowed out a slice and took the soft center to dunk which I enjoyed.  You have to get pizza at a pizza kitchen yes? So we shared the pepperoni because my husband wanted something with meat. My favorite is their white pie personally, but pepperoni is a classic so I couldn't argue. They have a roasted chicken and garlic pizza right now as well, but I'm weird about chicken and would lose my appetite if even the slightest piece of gristle made it to my plate so we didn't risk it. (this is why I stopped eating chicken at chipotle years ago too).  The pizza was good this time, albeit very oily from the pepperoni. Bonus points to our server though who refilled our waters at lightening speed and brought us things like extra napkins without having to ask.  While it's not the greatest pizza in the world, it will do in a pinch. I'm sure we will be back again, even if it is in another two years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine

Mechelle S.,"Roanoke, TX",282,307,630,5.0,10/18/2015,Love California Pizza Kitchen! One of the original fresh Pizza restaurants in town. Sure authentic Italian pizza is available in the area but at California Pizza Kitchen you get a yummy pizza with a crispy crust for less than$11.  Order the California Club Pizza; you will not be sorry. At first I thought lettuce on top with avocado and the mix of bacon and chicken is a nice flavor mix. If you are planning on taking some of the pizza home them ask them to put the lettuce be avocados on the side. They will give you extra to take home with you.  The ambiance is nice and clean and has a zen like feel; so California. If you have not visited California Pizza Kitchen in awhile then give them another try. They are now one of my top 5 restaurants to eat at.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine
Emily S.,"San Antonio, TX",60,26,5,1.0,3/4/2017,"The service here was less than stellar. The server seemed annoyed and agitated with us all night. We came to eat with a group and requested separate checks (when we sat down to make sure they were aware). The server misinterpreted and split the bill evenly.

Thuy N.,"Arlington, TX",58,151,899,3.0,10/10/2015,I am not a fancy pizza place kinda person but they do have a lot of variety.. I had the california club which is basically a an arula avacado tomatoes salad on top of a chicken pizza.  I prefer hand toss over thin crust.  The pizza itself is bland and they did not have siracha or hot sauce.  We shared a red velvet cake which is really good.  It has a thin layer of vanilla bean. Surprisingly it was not overly sweet or that rich.  I may just stick with the Original bbq chicken pizza since that is what they are known for... Or red velvet cheesecake.. My favorite is red velvet cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine
Steven Y.,"Roanoke, TX",123,396,343,4.0,3/23/2015,"Last week we took a group of seven people here for a late lunch (1:00 pm) to celebrate a co-workers birthday.  It had been a long time since I had been to this location so I did not remember what to expect.  Our waiter was Alberto and he did a great job taking care of the group, luckily there were not a lot of tables still left from the lunch crowd. I arrived later than the rest of the group because of meeting that had already been scheduled, so when I arrived with one additional person in the party they got us caught up with the rest of the group right away.  Alberto brought the two of us a fresh plate of bread and olive oil and go our order in right away. I had the Thai chicken pizza which was very tasty.  The thin crust is very light and has a great crunch or snap to it.  The flavors are full and spicy which makes this relatively simple pizza a real winner. Everyone in our party seemed very pleased with their choice of food and we had a great time. Enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine

Naeem B.,"San Antonio, TX",39,157,264,2.0,1/18/2016,"CPK use to be my family's favorite spot to eat, but over the years it has faded into a distant memory because of their declining performance. Despite our disappointment with them, we decided to give them another shot because we were feeling nostalgic. We decided to order two pizzas from there hoping that with their renovations came revitalized dishes.  We ordered the california veggie pizza and the thai chicken pizza online and were given an estimated ready time. I arrived a few minutes early and parked in the designated pick-up parking spot as instructed. I'm pretty patient so I waited until 10 minutes after the estimated ready time before getting anxious. I texted my mom and asked her if I was supposed to go inside. She assured me that I was just supposed to wait in the parking spot. I waited another five minutes and then another car pulled up next to me. I decided I would watch them and see if they went inside. They didn't; so the wait continued. Finally after another 10 minutes, a worker came outside, but he only went to the other man's car. He didn't even stop by my car. This really made me angry. Then after disappearing for another five minutes, he came out with the other guy's pizza and a receipt for me to sign. He went inside right after and I continued to wait another 5 minutes for him to reappear. This time he thankfully had my pizza, which I presumed would be fresh out of the oven since they made me wait 35 minutes. When I got home (I live 2 minutes away) we were disappointed to find that the pizza was not even warm. We had to heat up our pizza in the toaster oven. As for the flavors, they were sub par. The thai chicken had a bit of a kick, but there was barely any chicken on it. The veggie pizza was decent, but once again nothing special. Definitely not worth the struggle with them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=20

Mike B.,"Dallas, TX",0,21,,3.0,3/22/2017,"After not trying their pizza in a very long time, I decided to give it another go. I tried their lunchtime special - single person pizza and a salad. The pizza was a bit cold and not that tasty, the salad was good, and the service was just OK....in other words, it's just an OK place. I do like their Arugula Salad (a regular menu item).

Solomon C.,"Dallas, TX",17,21,14,2.0,2/23/2015,"Came here with the wife and baby on a rainy Sunday afternoon after church. The place was pretty empty so we were promptly seated. We got the spinach dip as an appetizer which came with tortilla chips. We usually love spinach dip as it is a ubiquitous appetizer that is hard to mess up. That being said we were pretty disappointed with the watery tasting dip. I got the Hawaiian pizza with bacon substituted for ham and my wife got the tequila lime chicken pasta. The pizza was nothing great, and the pineapples clearly came out of the can and were in huge slices on the pizza. My wife didn't enjoy her pasta, and it did seem dry without enough Alfredo sauce. The butter cake dessert with a scoop of ice cream was pretty good and our server was nice, but those were the only upsides of our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=20
Brad N.,"Frisco, TX",486,1057,234,3.0,6/23/2014,"A co-worker picked CPK for his birthday lunch last week, and upon walking in, I realized that it has probably been (literally) 20 years since I've been in the place. For better or worse, the interior, though clean, looks like it may not have changed much in that 20 years. I was almost getting a coffee shop/diner vibe from it (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Upon being seated, our server brought out some small bread pieces with a tiny dish of herb infused oil; it was good, but the oil dish needs to be about twice as big as it was.  Browsing the menu, I almost went with my standby from the '90s, Thai chicken pizza,. but I decided to go with the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. Upon delivery, I was a bit surprised to find that it was cut into five (!) unequally sized pieces (I didn't try to do the math). It featured chicken, bacon, red and yellow bell pepper, green onion and possibly some other veggies. The sauce, although vaguely ""jerk-y"", almost seemed more like a sweet and sour. It was an OK taste, but I've had decently authentic jerk chicken, and this wasn't it. Most of the heat seemed to come from my self-applied crushed red pepper flake.  The crust was a tiny bit tough (and much more so when I ate the rest for dinner), bit was otherwise OK.  All in all, it was a decent meal, and the menu has enough variety to where everyone can find something to eat, but it wouldn't be my first choice for the best and/or most authentic pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=20

Ana O.,"Fort Worth, TX",73,246,96,3.0,8/4/2013,"There used to be a time when CPK was a progressive and cool restaurant. Those days have passed, and now CPK is just meh. The food is still good but they have fallen stagnant and service has deteriorated.  It has been a while since we'd visited this location and the old pizza standbys are there and I was glad to see some options with the calorie count next to it. I ordered the shrimp zucchini fettuccine - it was good but the shrimp could have used some more seasoning. The sauce is a broth but I enjoyed the way the zucchini is incorporated into the dish.  The most surprising thing right off the bat is how empty the place is. I remember when there was a long wait for a table. The service was nothing spectacular and I didn't see anything that needed improvement cleanliness-wise.  I did notice that our server was not even in uniform. He was wearing jeans and a polo short. Wasn't there a time when they wore uniforms?  I decided that what has happened over the years is this: the public's tastes and restaurant menus have become more sophisticated and have simply outgrown CPK, who has not changed very much over time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=20

The two soups, tortilla and pea complement each other well. They also have an array of pastas, chicken dishes and sandwiches. A little bit of everything. I noticed they recently put a few new things on their menu that look very interesting. I like that they are staying with the new ""get healthy trend"" and put quinoa in one of their salads. I'm not sure I've seen quinoa in a mainstream restaurant to date. I tried their Asparagus and Arugula salad which was outstanding!

I would easily be the Duke, King, Supreme commander of this CPK. My wife loves their Asparagus and Spinach spaghettini and has had it every single time we've been here ( or any other CPK). I've tried several of their menu items Mango-Tikka PIzza.. good.. no longer on the menu Japanese Eggplant, Goat cheese, roasted peppers pizza. This is awesome..again no longer on the menu... whyyyy? Pepperoni . OK. Boring after a while Margaritta, ditto Chicken Tequilla Fettucine... fantastic flavor Ive tried a bunch of their appetizers all of which were good. I just done understand who orders some of their pizzas though.. like the salad pizzas.. It has been relatively consistent for all our visits and never had to wait for a table. (for the number of times I've come here, they should have a table with my name on it by now). The Mrs finally said that she was bored of the spaghettini.

It had the flavor and the perfect sauce to compliment it.  The jerk pizza with thin crust by far was the best pizza i ever had. The Thai Pizza was so yummy that the word cant describe it.

I ordered a Cranberry Cooler to drink and I wasn't impressed. He actually brought me a second one because I thought their club soda was out. Turns out the club soda was fine, this drink is just lacking so I suggest to pass on this one. Everyone ordered something different at our table. Hubbub ordered Chicken, spinach and artichoke pizza. My oldest daughter ordered chicken Thai pizza. I ordered The Greek but opted to do the vegetarian version which has avacoda instead of chicken. They were all DELICIOUS! The Greek tasted so fresh! There is also a guarantee at the bottom of every menu. They want you to be adventurous and try something NEW! If you don't like it they'll bring you usual pizza at no cost instead allowing you to try something different.  Then I ordered dessert to go. Red velvet cake with vanilla bean cream icing. It was all very good! The only reason I give it 4 stars if because it can be pretty expensive. I would give it 4 1/2 stars really.

Colin B.,"Arlington, TX",389,453,699,4.0,10/15/2009,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is a chain. Get over it. Chains aren't such a bad thing and pump out great stuff. See Whole Foods, for example. Like everyone else, I am picky about my pizza. I like mine thin crust so I can taste the toppings and am not stuck eating bread with a cheese and sauce after thought. I like it out of a wood burning oven with a crispy crust, almost burnt in places. I like the toppings to be fresh with herbs and variety. And California Pizza Kitchen pulled through on just that last night. My wifey and I split The Sicilian and it was amazing. Thing crust, spicy marinara, giant slices of pepperoni, sweet Italian sausage and other stuff that was off the charts good. My Mom had a margherita (spelling?) and I am currently eating it left over... not bad. Dad had a salad I need to learn to make at home, the Miso salad with crab and shrimp. It was light, sweet, filling and fancy for whatever $10 or so he paid for it. I'd go back just to get a full portion of that salad. The service was great. We had some girl from Omaha (her badge said so) and she was chipper and gleeful and all kinds of helpful. The only downside is you can tell she had to go through the corporate motions of upsell this, talk about that, mention the raspberry lemonade, blah blah blah. I waited tables, I see right through that. Don't sell to me, I can figure out you have a full bar and probably serve Coors Light. A note on the decor in this place: I don't remember it being bad, but then again the last time I went in was 5 years ago. It is combinations of yellow and khaki and it just seems dated. It is like a Pei Wei but the tacky old 70s version of it. But the pizza was great, so who cares.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=60

That's what happens when you pre-bake the crust ahead of time. No telling how long they had been there. I witnessed the cook moving all over the kitchen working on orders and not once did she put on gloves.

I decided to try the strawberry mojito to, which was good. I ordered the mushroom pizza and my husband ordered the pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza, both on a thin and crispy crust. Both were very good. These are the things that earned the 3 stars awarded. Now for the problems that cost them the other two stars: when I ordered the mojito, my husband ordered a beer. They brought me 2 mojitos and him no beer. After returning one of mojitos his beer arrived. While waiting for our pizza, the waitress asked if I'd like another mojito and I said, ""yes."" That mojito never arrived. When the pizzas arrived, my husband's was not thin and crispy, but he didn't complain. Shortly thereafter, a gentleman from the kitchen showed up to offer the thin and crispy pizza, which had apparently been sitting there all along. He switched pizzas.

We got a free kids meal from a reading club so decided to give it an updated shot after a movie one wed afternoon just the kiddo and I.  The service was good, and we stuck to pizza because it was in the name. Yet I will admit I for what would be a ""plain one topping pizza"" it's on the pricy end. My daughter got a plain cheese and I did the smaller tomato and cheese. We ended up still spending about if not more after adding tip what we would have taking her somewhere a little more kid friendly.

Scott N.,"Bothell, WA",7,53,5,2.0,7/16/2014,"We've been going to this CPK for a couple of years, and always had a nice experience.  Until the latest trip a couple of days ago. Mid afternoon.  Very light customer traffic.  Were greeted by the smiling and friendly seating host who quickly put us in our favorite booth.   Then nothing. Seriously - nothing.  At least three waiters walked past us a couple of times, not even acknowledging our existence.  Then the manager walked by us.  Twice.  We had suddenly become invisible.  Lots of visiting other tables by the waiters and the manager; lots of laughter at those tables.  Crickets at ours. I tried to get the attention of the waiters a couple of times.  No.  After nearly 15 minutes, I finally walked back to the seating host, who acted surprised that I was visible.  He seemed genuinely shocked at my presence - didn't remember us at all.   So the seating host walked up to one of the wait staff, who then began to argue with him about serving us.  What the hell?  So far as we could tell, we didn't stink and we could see each other, so why did all this happen? After much arguing, she came to our table and I tried to ask her about a discount coupon we had.  She took our drink order and said she'd take care of the discount.   Then more nothing.  No drinks, no bread, no nothing.   Just as I reached for my phone to leave, another waiter showed up.  He had just arrived and seemed to be able to see us.  At last!  We weren't invisible any more! He took care of everything in a friendly, but cautious manner.  Apparently he'd been told we were trolls and he had drawn the short straw to be our server.  But, honestly, he did his best.  There was one strange interaction when he asked us if we wanted fresh bread.  We said yes (of course).  Then no bread.  When we asked him about it, he said that the kitchen had decided not to bake any bread.   Finally, the manager came to our table to open our discount card.  But, despite appearing to be the same manager who was friendly and laughing with other customers, he was stone-faced and very unfriendly with us.   Strangest encounter with a restaurant in my life.  I've had worse encounters, but this one took the cake for weirdness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=40

My friend used to work at one of the CPK's and frequently brought food back for us to try so I am lucky to have tried most of the things on the menu. I really recommend the Tuscan Hummus as a appetizer as they bring warm pita bread to accompany the savory hummus. It's topped with fresh tomatoes and parsley and thick enough to melt on your palate. Yummy.  I always get the Chinese Chicken Salad with my meal because the napa cabbage is cut thinly and nice, and all the meals regardless of what you order have great chemistry together, and you leave satisfied and happy after each meal.

So there pizza selection was amazing. Finally decided on the Club Pizza. Now I will hand it to them on this one. Never seen or tasted anything like it before. It had bacon and cheese, then on top of that was alot of lettuce rolled in a mayonaise sauce they make. Atop of that was huge slices of avacado. The pizza pretty much won me over. The size is not very big, but who wants to take that pizza home with lettuce and avacado and reheat it? So I saw there point on that one. Beer prices are too high for me there, so just had water.

Michael R.,"Dallas, TX",14,75,8,5.0,11/23/2008,"As with any restaurant, the service at this location can vary by the waiter you get and how busy the restaurant is that night, but overall it's good. This location is central to a friend I get together with regularly so I eat here probably 2-3 times per month or more.  Obviously their primary offering is pizza. All pizzas are personal sized, probably 9-10"" if I had to guess. Their standard crust is sort of a thick pita bread/thin pizza crust. They have a thin crust option that is nearly a cracker and from what I've heard from friends, not very good. Their standard crust is also available in a honey wheat variety by request. Pizzas are cooked in a wood oven in their open kitchen.  Their most popular pizzas are BBQ Chicken and Thai Chicken but they have lots of other interesting options. Some combinations sound odd but are probably very good. They offer an ""adventurer's guarantee"" which means that you are invited to try something new and if you don't like it, they will replace it with your favorite at no extra charge. I typically get the garlic chicken or the BBQ chicken pizzas.  They also have very good salads available in full or half sizes. My friend gets the Thai crunch salad which he raves about every time we go.  Some of their pasta offerings are good, but I wasn't all that satisfied with the fettuccine Alfredo that came with a salmon dish I got once. The alfredo sauce was too thick and pasty.  A favorite appetizer is their Tuscan Hummus which is made with white beans and garlic and served with wonderful thick pita bread. We get it almost every time we go.  This location offers free sourdough bread and butter if you ask. It used to be a standard offering but I guess corporate stopped it, but some people expect it so they continue to offer it on request.  They offer a variety of desserts beyond the standard cheesecake/apple/brownie offerings of every other restaurant. This includes red velvet cake, Chocolate Soufflé Cake, and a chocolate banana royale cake that was well received by our group in the past.  Seasonally they have pumpkin cheesecake which in the past I remember being incredible, but they seem to have fallen into the trend I noticed in cookbooks this year where plain pumpkin cheesecake is too boring, so they have to mix it with something. In this case, it's a pumpkin cheesecake with a ginger praline crust. If you didn't eat the crust it wasn't bad, but there was a layer of something else and really the pumpkin only existed on the top layer. Other places have better pumpkin cheesecake now. Saltgrass Steakhouse and Cheesecake Factory are the two best I know of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Beau F.,"Fort Worth, TX",74,71,7,4.0,3/5/2012,This place is pretty good. I love the bacon club egg rolls.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Izzy F.,"Addison, TX",0,2,,2.0,5/15/2012,"Probably won't go back here. Okay I won't. The food wasn't horrible, it tasted good. (Not great, good) The problem was: it was lukewarm. I don't know about you, but I like my food piping hot when it's brought to me.  Why? Because I know that when I'm talking or casually eating my food it's going to cool down. And that's exactly what it was cold. I guess I'm saying that it's not worth it, nothing really stands out with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Ken f.,"Fort Worth, TX",218,174,100,5.0,8/7/2011,Fire oven pizza good stuff. I like the wheat crust pizza dough. Ask for Robert or Boone who bartend. The food is a little pricey though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Vincent C.,"Arlington, TX",23,43,20,4.0,7/11/2011,"I haven't been to California Pizza Kitchen in a long time, and I missed how good it is.  The place has a nice atmosphere and our server was very nice and helpful.  We started off with the Crunchy Mac n Cheese, which was pretty tasty.  I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pizza and my friend had the Meat Cravers.  Both were really good.  My only complaint would be how pricey it is compared to other gourmet pizza places, but going there on occasion is a treat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Jamie H.,"Aberdeen, MD",144,467,169,4.0,10/24/2010,My hubby and I went to our local CPK ( for the zillionth time ) for a pasta craving and he ended up getting the Sicilian pizza. I choose something new & tried the Moroccan Chicken Salad. The salad was amazing with all sorts of flavors. I'm full but I still want more. We split a Tiramusu to top of the great meal.

Ashley B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",426,177,77,1.0,8/26/2007,"This review is pretty outdate since I haven't gone there more then once or twice in the past few years. But when it first opened, I was unfortunate enough to have friends that loved it. The service was always slow slow SLOW. People in California have never heard of this place for a reason. The food is gross! I love unique pizza (can you say spinach, mushroom, and alfredo anyone?) but this is just cheap and nasty. Avoid it at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
S T.,"Fort Worth, TX",245,380,1129,4.0,9/16/2010,I first tried this place in Atlanta off of Peach Tree and was so in love with the oven brick style cooking right up close and personal. The taste is sooo good and fresh. Drinks aren't that bad either.

Preston B.,"Queens, NY",25,100,1,5.0,8/31/2006,"I love California Pizza Kitchen! They always serve a great product! Last time I went they apologized for taking so long and gave me my pizza for free... and I had only been sitting there for 15 minutes, I didn't complain and thought the pizza was out earlier than usual... i was sooo happy! Their pizza's are all amazing and just are different than anything else you will get. It's always cool to try a new pizza. I have found the perfect one! The Japanese Eggplant with Goat Cheese!!! IT'S SOOOOOO AMAZING! Get it on Honey Wheat dough!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Ryan B.,"Richardson, TX",222,395,202,4.0,9/8/2009,"Even though it is located in epicenter of Grapevine's chain restaurant abyss, CPK is still a good option. A few things I can comment on: 1) They'll give you a healthier alternative to the 'bleached enriched white flour' dough and make you a whole wheat crust instead. 2) They don't have anchovies. 3) They use fresh-sliced Serrano peppers when you ask for jalapenos, and Serrano's are hotter. 4) Their tiramisu is awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Kelli R.,"Mesquite, TX",13,75,1,4.0,3/18/2010,Had a really good experience here.   They encourage you to try something new and if you dont like it they will trade it for something more standard.  I tried the Thai chicken pizza and didnt even think about trading!   Really different..and really good.  Our server was great..I will definitely go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Suzanne S.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",206,120,10,5.0,6/3/2007,"Since moving from D/FW several years ago, I've come to appreciate CPK. We now frequent the actual original location in Beverly Hills as our hometown CPK and what impresses me about the chain is that no matter what locale you step into ... the service and food are always top-notch.  The Grapevine location is no exception ... the wait-staff is so friendly and the food is just as tasty as at the original location. I don't typically love chain restaurants, but I make an exception for CPK ... they use quality ingredients, have one of the best salad menus around, and their pizza options are always consistently yum-e.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Steve M.,"Norman, OK",1,63,,5.0,6/19/2010,P.F. Changs had an hour long wait so we went to CPK.  Service was awesome.  Very friendly which always makes a big difference to me.  I got the Jamica Jerk Chicken pizza which was spicy and very good.  The waitress brought out my wife's pizza and then came back a minute later with another one.  She said they thought the first one was a little over cooked so they made her another one.  Note:  We did not ask for this.  They did it on their own.  Very impressive.  We kept the first one because it wasn't over done much at all.  This is the kind of service that will make us come back.  I highly recommend this CPK.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Elizabeth N.,"Las Vegas, NV",770,276,184,3.0,7/23/2008,"Overpriced everything (but still always returning to try more menu items). The pizzas are good if you pick the right ones, just make sure to read over the item descriptions and adjust accordingly with your server.

Traci B.,"Weatherford, TX",158,211,130,4.0,8/15/2008,Man this place has some yummy dishes! There is this lime-chicken-pasta thing that is exceptional.

texan G.,"Richardson, TX",0,6,,1.0,10/17/2011,"can i give a negative rating?? Please read below to learn why.. My husband and I went along with a few of our friends to CPK at grapevine,tx couple of weeks ago. My husband ordered a pizza first.  I later decided to order a salad as well. The waiter brought out the salad  and i found a hair nicely rooted into a dried tomato in the salad!!! Completely disgusting. My god!!You would think they would take some extra care preparing a salad.. Anyway I called the waiter and showed her the hair that was nicely rooted in the tomato. I asked her for another salad as no one in their right mind would go ahead and eat that. Anyway she said the kitchen was closed and that she cannot get me another one..Well in that case you would assume that they would at least take it off the check.. Nope non-apologetically she brought the check with the salad included in it.  She just acted as though nothing happened. Seriously I have not seen any other restaurant with such a worst customer service. who does this kind of a thing? It was their mistake so they should rectify it. If they have to charge me for it they should at least have the courtesy to bring me a new salad. I pay for something which is not edible b'cos of their mistake and I have to pay for it??? ridiculous.. Such a bad experience... It's very hard to fathom that a restaruant like CPK is capable of such a bad customer experience.. I did not ask them for a favor.. I asked them to fix something they screwed up and I was willing to pay for it once they fix it.. But CPK would rather let me pay for their mistake than fix it .. Good Job CPK.. This is how you run a business.. Anyway we did not want to beg them to remove the salad off. We paid.. One last final bill at CPK..We decided we will never ever go back.  Thankfully there are plenty of restaurants in DFW metroplex who offer a very good service and have xcellent food every time u go..  So GoodBye for ever CPK..  Btw, How do I post a picture? I actually took a picture so i can post it here..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=80
Jordan S.,"Grapevine, TX",23,153,16,1.0,9/12/2009,I honestly cant belive this is still around. Pizza styles are gourmet and not everyday type of meat and cheese. This place is normally semi busy which I just am not sure how this can be. Another dime a dozen pizza place that is overpriced. Id pass and go somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=100
Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",516,2583,7,4.0,1/4/2009,"I'll give this place credit for what it is, as it is a franchise that has to mass produce.  Business here is always pretty busy, as it is at a huge intersection in greater DFW.  Appetizers are pretty fun here, as they have California club eggrolls with bacon, avocado, and chicken.  Pizza is pretty clever here too, with a real California take.  Honey-wheat pizza is a nice healthier option, but texture is nothing to special on either crust here.  Just a simple palate for a variety of ingredients.  BBQ chicken sauce is a bit too sweet, but the California is a nice chicken pizza.  Another good chicken option is the jerk, which has a bit of a kick.  The Greek is also good, as the tzaziki sauce is not half bad, and the olives and feta give it an actual ethnic touch.  Wild mushroom pizza is actually pretty original, with this nice walnut pesto.  For a healthier pizza, go for the crispy, thin crusted Tricolor salad pizza, as it comes topped with a heaping mound of simply dressed greens and raddichio.  All in all, pizzas are a tad unique here, but it does lack authentic flair in each of its ethnic pizzas, though all are prepared up to pizza standards.  Definitely one for groups and families.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-grapevine?start=100
