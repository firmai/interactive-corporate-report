Chain restaurants stake their reputations on keeping their food quality the same from location to location so you know what you're gonna get. Why folks complain about that boggles my mind. So whenever a middle-of-the-pack chain restaurant breaks the mold (and isn't serving it) I think it extra worthy of praise. On our most recent visit, we were served-up two outstanding burgers -- both fresh, piping hot and equally mounded with Swiss cheese, mushrooms and other fixings -- as good as you'll find in many of the trendier burger joints. And it was served with fries still steaming, at a most inconvenient time, on a warm evening just before closing.

13,Joanna R.,"Portland, ME",140,223,3362.0,4.0,2014-12-03,"It's a Chili's, a chain I know. But it's a great Chili's! I am usually here during the week for lunch and each time the service and food were prompt. I never had the anxiousness that I was going to be delayed in getting back to work. It's the little things that go a long way with me. I love as I walk up to the door there is a greeter that welcomes us and holds the door open for us :) Typically we arrive around 11:30am and I have NEVER had to wait for someone to greet us or for a table to open up. There is always the option for high tables or dining room. Once seated the servers are usually at our table in 1-2 minutes taking our drink orders. Drinks arrive within 5 minutes and usually we are not ready to provide our order,  but no worries, they don't stray too far and seem to always appear when we look up from our menus. Here is where they lose one star. For some reason, the chips tend to be overly salted or stuck together, while edible it is not necessary. If I have time, I usually ask for unsalted chips and it is worth the wait. The food times very well, as soon as we are about halfway through chips the orders arrive. My orders have always arrived as expected based on the descriptions and prepared as requested, for example, medium for a burger, is typically medium. The lunch combo menu is a great value, good quality and takes no time at all to arrive, but if you are a slow eater, you may want to pass, because it is a lot of food for lunch portions. I love the chili - they use chunk tomatoes and shredded beef and a touch of melted cheese on top. Very tasty and terrific to dip the chip appetizer in as well. For me, the quesadilla is my go to entree - chicken, bacon, ranch. Very flavorful sometimes a bit too salty, but that's rare. Refills are not a problem - the lunch staff are ninja like and very attentive. They sneak up with soda refills without us having to ask and take away empty cups and plates so it doesn't look like we are hoarding dishes. The place has only gotten better recently with the pay terminals at the table. LOVE that! You can split the bill, it has a tip meter and it prints your receipt! It really can't get any more convenient and efficient for me. I highly recommend this place for a work lunch.

My boyfriend usually gets the fajitas which used to be great and now they are bland and not as sizzling anymore. They have changed the way they make their burgers they now taste like an slight upgrade to McDonalds. The burgers now have a ton of mustard on them and they are served on new rolls which never needed to be changed in the first place and their homemade pickles which are salty and tasteless. They no longer have mushrooms which I loved on the mushroom swiss burger and with a steak.

7,Kelly F.,"North Providence, RI",169,309,45.0,2.0,2015-12-29,"No bueno. This was my favorite locations until yesterday. We usually just sit in the bar area but when we walked over, the floor was sticky, and there was a smell.... So we asked to be seated in the main dining area. The host said he had to clean off a table so we waited. When he showed us to our table, the seat was dirty and there was literally a pile of trash under the table. My husband was like ""No thanks we'll just sit here. "" So we sat at the booth across from it that was clean. I don't know how he didn't see it. Gross.  The watermelon margarita is really good. It's made with tequila, sour mix and watermelon puree. I ordered the chicken bacon quesadillas and they were a tad too greasy. The Texas fries were scrumptious. They're served in a skillet and topped with bacon and cheese. We opted for the half order. The portions are huge here. We split dessert. The toffee brownie Sunday is perfect to split. My little guy had pizza. Meh. I like you can pay at the table kiosk but was surprised at the $1.99 charge for games. No big deal but I would have rather let him use my phone had I known. Overall I feel like this place needs a really good bath. It's just dirty all at around. My kitchen with a smelly old dog and 3 guys is cleaner....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

Nachos....well if you call 8 tortilla chips, should I say, burnt tortilla chips with burnt cheese on them , nachos....then they were great .... Figured the bartender when serving them to us would realize they were burnt.  She obviously ignored us, maybe she was embarrassed...when she asked if everything was ok and I said ""you can take the nachos back, they are burnt.""  She responded with ""you didn't like them?""    Sweetheart, they weren't touched.... Again.  It's chilis.  Don't expect much.    That all being said they did take the nachos off and she did apologize...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
16,Dina M.,"Manville, RI",13,74,1.0,1.0,2016-01-06,Yikes!!  This used to be my go to place for some fajitas but not anymore. They jip you on food so bad and the new spice they use is awful.  The fajitas I got were literally one string of meat loaded with fat. I picked up one piece and the whole thing came up by strands and chunks of fat.  Yuck!  The service is awful and food is not far behind. I've never gotten good service at this location ever. Come to think of it chilis in general has awful service and awful management as well as sub par food that has somehow gotten way worse. We refuse to go here anymore. Until they start using quality ingredients and start hiring quality management and staff I will not go to any chilis!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
19,Jennifer S.,"Woonsocket, RI",28,56,23.0,4.0,2016-01-20,Went here for the first time tonight and it was great! I had low expectations bc of other reviews but we had a gift card so we tried it.

17,Abby C.,"Cranston, RI",154,113,32.0,2.0,2016-02-17,"Came here yesterday with a friend to pick up our take-out order. Well, when we arrived (about 5-10 minutes early) our food was not ready and the staff claimed that our orders did not come in. I physically called the restaurant with my order, so I have no idea how that is possible. We waited about 10 minutes until our food was ready. Not ideal when you are on lunch break. Also, my side salad was shoved into a small cup. It was impossible to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
0,Kristen A.,"Lincoln, RI",66,184,189.0,3.0,2016-04-13,"As far as Chili's goes, this location is OK. When you take out location as a factor, this is how I see it: PROS: The restaurant is always clean Rarely need to wait to be seated Friendly staff Can actually taste the alcohol in drinks CONS: Frequent errors w/orders - at least one every visit Inconsistent quality SLOW diner service Monday-Thursday Can often be packed with borderline obnoxious diners on Friday/Saturday nights I come back simply because it's convenient, not too pricy, & there is always something on the menu everyone likes.

11,Elizabeth B.,"Lincoln, RI",1,18,4.0,5.0,2016-10-15,"I've been going to this Chili's consistently for the past four years. The 5 stars is because of the staff...I also have to average the amount of times the food is really good and weigh it against a couple bad experiences. We have had the same servers for years. It's nice to come in and have someone recognize you, remember your drink order or come over to say ""HI"", even when they don't have your table. I want to give a shout out to them because even though it's a chain restaurant,  it doesn't feel that way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
5,Patrick M.,"North Smithfield, RI",17,67,345.0,2.0,2016-10-30,"So I went to Chili's the other night with some friends and it was packed so obviously the service was slow, the waitress was nice though. I got the triple dipper with the original chicken crispers which seemed different this time and the honey chipotle chicken crispers that were barely crispy. Someone at my table ordered a tex mex bowl that was supposed to have avocado in it but the waitress didn't tell us they were out of avacado until AFTER she brought us our food. Some people just have no commonsense. I do have to say my non alcoholic strawberry margarita was a little sour but super delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
8,Jason P.,"Whitinsville, MA",25,34,54.0,3.0,2016-12-13,Came here with my son.  Ordered some wings as appetizers.  Unfortunately they came out lukewarm at best.  Almost cool.  But they did replace them.  Staff was very nice.  The rest of the meal was fine.  I had a burrito and my son got a burger.  Both were good.  I would go again as they have a pretty big menu and I'm sure they have some better items.  But for what we ordered it was just ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
9,Laura T.,"Lincoln, RI",3,12,,3.0,2017-01-03,"I would not recommend going here unless you have a party of 5 or more. The waiters don't care.  I work right next to this Chili's so I order food from here a lot. However I have not had very many good experiences.  On 1-2-17 we had stopped in late to grab some dinner. Our waiter Adrian seemed much too distracted. It took a long time for him to come and take our drink order and even longer to bring them over. He just ran by and dropped the glasses without stopping.  It took even longer to get the check, and even thought we really wanted dessert, we were unable to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
10,Cuitlahuac G.,"Woonsocket, RI",1,25,,4.0,2017-03-25,"Decided to go out for lunch and the restaurant looked very full but we walked in and sat right down, it was surprising. I love the chips and salsa it's a solid choice. We decided to get burgers, I ordered the ""ULTIMATE"" bacon burger. The bacon wasn't ultimate I don't think it even had 1 full strip of bacon. The burgers are good I just found it funny that the bacon burger lacked bacon. I loved the strawberry lemonade and the service was on point. Didn't have to ask for a refill at all. The only down side was the lack of bacon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

1,Mason S.,"Providence, RI",2,14,5.0,1.0,2018-01-07,"If I could give this place negative stars, it would be a negative -5.  Awful service.. upon entering, hostess made us wait only stating that it would be a few minutes.. when we asked exactly what a few minutes meant, she responded, well more like ten minutes.. meanwhile it's 2:15pm on a Sunday, and they are not busy.   Finally seated at the smallest booth on earth for two people.. ordered the trio app and a drink.. the margarita mix was spoiled and tasted mad funky, when asked to fix it, the waitress just said order a replacement, no apologies.. the second came with little/no alcohol, just mix..  The app trio was ""dropped"" by the food runner with two plates tossed on this small ass table.  The sliders where over cooked and dry with congealed cheese.. the southwestern egg rolls where dry and looked like they were sitting in a pan waiting to be freed.. they had a film on the filling.. disgusting.. the best was the fact that our apps were served, within minutes the entree was served.   Like no room on this small ass table and the runner left us literally holding the plates in the air while they took off.. the salad had quesadillas on the side, which were rock hard with congealed cheese in the center.. and the chicken waffle crispers had the most sawdust dry waffles I have ever tasted.. they were cold and dry and bland.  Did help that they served that entree wrong with incorrect sides.   The best was after this dining experience to be handed the check, and the waitress disappeared, we sat for over twenty minutes trying to exit this horror show of nightmare customer service.  Finally had to get the hostess to cash us out, and yet the waitress was still no where to be found!  AVOID CHILI'S In Lincoln!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lincoln-3,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
