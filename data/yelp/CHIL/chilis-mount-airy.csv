Allen T.,"Boonville, NC",5,94,195,4.0,1/21/2017,"Have eaten at this location twice. The first time was great service and great food. This time however the service was subpar. The server brought the wrong items and or wrong plates. There were items that never arrived even after reminding the server. Never came back to check our drinks. Just not sure what was going on tonight. Update:  Recent visit: Our server Savanna was very professional and attentive. Our drinks were kept topped off and she checked on us several times to insure the food and service was right. Wait time was nothing at 4ish on a Saturday afternoon. Food was presented neatly and appetizing. The dinning area was clean and neat. The bathrooms were clean and well supplied. The food was very good, hot and fresh. A very different experience from my last visit. I would have to visit again to insure the experience is consistent before I would really recommend. But this time was a great one",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Rusty J.,"Concord, NC",11,101,59,4.0,7/17/2016,I ate at this location tonight with my son.  We got the 2 for 20. My fajitas were good as always. My son got quesadillas and enjoyed them.  The service was above average and very nice. Our food arrived in a somewhat timely manner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Haley M.,"Mount Airy, NC",0,48,11,5.0,9/2/2016,"The management was replaced and I haven't had any more problems since. Talked to the new manager once and he was much nicer than the last one. My chicken wings are tasty and hot again! And the waitresses all seem to remember my usual, which is fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Chandler M.,"Pilot Mountain, NC",20,43,,4.0,8/2/2016,"It's a Chilies so the service is fundamentally flawed, so they don't turn tables quickly, but the individual servers are really good. The food is what it should be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Taylor T.,"Ahoskie, NC",8,13,1,5.0,2/21/2016,Good service on a busy night food was ready in a timely manner. We ordered to go and order was correct although they forgot utensils and we were staying at a hotel.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Chad M.,"Concord, NC",0,4,,1.0,4/1/2016,The worst chilis I've ever been to. I ordered a smothered carnitas burrito and it had day old dry hard chicken in it. It was so hard I dinged it on my plate and told the bartender how the hell can this be eaten. It was taken of my bill but my god this place is sketchy. Stay away from this place. I think it should be inspected. I'll never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Sascha F.,"Winston-Salem, NC",218,17,1,1.0,4/18/2015,The service was Terrible.  We spent the night dodging head wounds from careless wait staff and hostesses,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Haley B.,"Pilot Mountain, NC",0,2,,5.0,5/25/2016,"Great place, best restaurant option in Mount airy by far and great customer service!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Jess M.,"Tijuana, Mexico",366,364,1041,4.0,8/16/2013,"Chili's pretty much rules the mid-grade chain restaurants. I like the healthy options on the menu. Their grilled chicken is delicious. I wish they had a few more draft beers to choose from, but I can make do. This one is in a convenient location too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
Michaela L.,"New York, NY",0,23,3,4.0,5/10/2013,"Standard chilis menu, good size bar with booth, bar and high top table seating. Noticed that this location scored an ""A"" and 98 points from their health inspection in late March 2013.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mount-airy
