Shaby F.,"Hidden Hills, CA",88,32,1,4.0,12/26/2017,"Updating my review: Management sent me a courtesy E-giftcard to go back and try this location. I thought that was super sweet and so the family and I ventured back to try one more time and we were pleasantly surprised.  Hostess was a bit rude, she asked me to stand in a walkway, and then a waiter asked me to move and she basically told me to go back to the walkway. But we were seated in half the time estimated so that was nice. Our waiter was so sweet and friendly. We really enjoyed having him as our server. Although he seemed busy, and a bit flustered, but he was a total sweetie pie. Our food took a little long, but it was all SO good. I wasn't disappointed at all this time. Warm food, good taste, and all very filling with great portion sizes. We will most definitely be back to this location and I'm glad we gave it another shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village
Carly M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",51,42,8,1.0,12/12/2017,"I feel sick.. worst food ever.  I ordered the shrimp scampi & the shrimp tasted awful. Spaghetti had some greasy cheap butter blend with a tinge of garlic. Even the wedge salad was awful.  Most of the lettuce was the hard center part.  The Dressing tasted like some awful cheap low end salad dressing.  Pure nastiness.  High prices for cheap low quality food.  This area has some nice places to eat & Bj's is NOT one of them.  Best to take your money elsewhere & not eat here.   I used to love this chain but the quality of their food has gone so downhill, it's time for them to either re-evaluate or close down.  I don't drink beer so they can't get me drunk to not notice their food sucks.  If anyone who reads this & still makes the decision to give Bj's a try, don't say I didn't try to warn ya.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village
Dan G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",9,14,3,2.0,12/5/2017,"Came here last night for dinner. BJ's has 50% off on pizza on Monday nights, so we went for that. While it was busy, the service was extremely poor, probably the worst it's been in all the times I've been there. Firstly, I gave the waiter my phone number so that I could get the points (as I'm a premier rewards member). As of this morning, I still have not received credit and don't expect to at this point. Secondly, it took nearly 10 minutes for our waiter to initially come to our table to ask us what we wanted to drink. Throughout the time we were there, he rarely came by to check to see how things were. By the time we got our food, it was not very warm. Apparently we were not the only ones dissatisfied with the service. There was a group of people at the table behind us that asked to speak with the manager for the same reason. To top it all off, we were originally charged full price for the pizza. Fortunately we noticed before paying the bill, but who knows if there are others that this happened to that didn't catch it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village
Moshe L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",79,84,39,2.0,1/4/2018,"So me, the most beautiful woman in the world and Crazy Kid #1 AKA Long and Lean went out to eat for dinner because it was the MBWITW's birthday.  So naturally, it is her choice of where to go.  She mentioned new gluten free this and dairy free that choices available at BJ's so how could I say no?   It is her birthday and they do have Pizookie (the large freshly made cookie in a big tin topped with ice cream) - so double score.  We get in and the place is not quite as busy as it used to be and only a 3 star on Yelp?  What's happening here?  Normally 3 on Yelp - I'm Audi5000,  What could it be, I imagined?  Didn't they get the Pizookie? Don't like MicroBrews?  Cant reach the Barstools?  Not sure.  So hoping to see for myself, I stayed.  We were greeted by a very cheerful hostess and sat within 5 minutes at one of the nice cushy booths facing the Bar no less so we could watch some of the activity.   Now on to the meal.  I had the chicken fried steak because it is such a large menu and I had to make a decision.   CK#1 got the thin crust pizza that was 15.95 and advertised at 16 X 10.  The MBWINTH got a quinoa dish mainly to show off that she can pronounce quinoa.    First thing I noticed.  The pizza looked good, but relatively small for 16 bucks.  I would have it at about 12 X 8.  So we were missing quite a lot of mass on the pie.  The MBWITW quinoa dish was alright and she claimed it had some stones in the quinoa, which it sometimes has.  And my meal was served with cold fries - that I had to send back.  The sandwich I had was actually very good.  Chicken fried steak with avocado and tomato and a fried egg and gravy on a brioche bun.  I do not usually mark down a restaurant for poor service but we were waiting for 20 minutes after our meal was finished just to get the check and box for take home.   So my suggestion for BJ's is go back to what you know  Forget the thin crust, forget the menu with so many items.  It is better to do a few things great than a number of things meh.  You do several things right such as Good Beer, Deep Dish Pizza and Pizookie!  Stick to your roots and up your game, you are a few tweaks from being a great restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village

Dani N.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1860,292,3433,5.0,3/23/2017,"This review is based on the million Pazookie (dessert) experiences I have had here and has nothing to do with the rest of the menu, just a fair warning! In high school, this was our go to spot for meet and gossips. We'd all hop in our cars, cruise down TO Boulevard like we were ""all that"" and grab a booth at BJ's for a round of Pazzokies! That. Was. The. Life. It seemed like every flavor they ever added we tried but all would agree the OG Chocolate Chip would over rule all.  Thinking back on my experiences back then to even my most recent experience not 2 months ago, the service has always treated me with respect and a smile on their faces. The wait was never that long, even if there was a line of waiting parties posted up around the corner. They really seem to have a smooth system down and put their employees through a proper training course.  My obvious favorite part about the BJ's chains are the Pazzokies, but this restaurant location in particular always has the whole table's orders out, hot and ready in a timely manner. They even offer to split bill without a single fuss. It makes the group dessert experience so pleasant all around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village

Danette A.,"Oak Park, CA",0,13,,2.0,1/7/2018,"I keep wanting to give this place a chance, but on very visit, there is always a challenge. First off, why is this place always on a wait on a Friday night until 8:30pm?! Yes I know because most think it's a great place to enjoy a night out with friends or family but if any of my visits were at 100% then I would get it or if their happy hour pricing was worthwhile. Visit #1: Server was new (he told me and my guest) so we went with it. Guests order arrived incorrect. I asked for a glass of wine but sent it back and ordered another. When check arrived, the first glass of wine never removed. After receiving the check, server never returned until about 20 minutes later? So after the check arrives then that completes your service? I usually pay the tip based on the timing of how you close out the table. Visit #2: Sat in the bar this time. Server was monotone and no emotion throughout service. Got my order and my guests order incorrect let alone forgot what we both ordered and had to return to our table to ask again. Write it down, man! When check arrived we asked to have the check split onto 2 credit cards. Took awhile to return with bill and credit cards. Next day, my credit card had fraudulent charges from Mexico City for $700 and the server had charged my card for the full amount of the bill, but voided out and then charged the halved amount. My guest did not have this happen on her credit card. Called manager to advise of this and also that the name of the server on the bill noted a woman's name but our server was a male. Hmmm Visit #3: All I can say is that my guest and I were quite thirsty for water from beginning to end. After check arrived before paying, server no longer inquired if we needed more water but glasses were empty. After we signed the check and paid, we sat at the table for a little longer and no sign of the server to collect or if more water was needed. I get it, it's just water but server should be just as attentive until the guest leaves the table. Visit #4: not sure yet if I want to come back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village

Mike R.,"Sandy, OR",0,5,2,1.0,12/24/2017,"Really disappointing experience last night.  Went there for a rare evening out with my wife plus our 2 & 4 year olds. Got a salad, steak with asparagus side, and kids plain pasta. Here's the summary of events: - ordered pasta to come plain with no sauce/oil (how my daughter eats it) - waited and they bring a bowl of pasta with oil (middle is room temp, surface is actually cold).  - we call to ask why it's cold and that we requested plain pasta.  Waitress checks with the manager and they said they cannot do that because ""the pasta is premade and sitting in the back"". (Reminder, this is angel hair pasta which takes 5 minutes to make) - they take the bowl away and bring back a ""warm one"" - by the dried surface, they probably put the original the microwave.  - steak arrives.  Ordered med well. See photo depicting menu and actual item.  Steak looks like roadkill which was then over cooked.  - we call someone to inquire if 3 stalks of asparagus (one missing the head) is considered a ""side"".  They admit that isn't right and being a plate of it.  - after we are done, we sit for 10 min waiting for the check or even someone to recognize we are there (notably several tables are empty). We can see other waiters standing on the sides and watching football.  - check finally comes. They have charged us TWICE for the pasta.

Ali S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,31,3,1.0,8/20/2017,"I've been to a lot of BJ's and I have to say I found the absolute worst one! It started off when I gave them a call to find out if it was happy hour. I wanted to confirm when it started and when it ended, also if long island ice teas where on the menu. Oddly long islands were recently removed.. Ive been getting long islands from Bjs for over 5 years whenever I hit the happy hour. Not sure if this is a franchise thing or just this location.  When I got there with my gf I asked the hostesses for a booth that so that I could sit next to my GF instead of across, she looked at me like I was asking her to build a rocket-ship then dragged her way over to another table with a shitty look on her face. Our waiter came by and I asked him where the happy hour menu was and he pulls out this stupid Ipad looking thing and says to me that I cannot get happy hour where I'm currently sitting because the technology has changed and drinks cant be rang up at the bar and brought over. Then he repeated to me two times ""but happy hour is only from 3-6"" like it was already past the time or something and it was 530.My mind was blown!  Finally the straw that broke the camels back... My GF asked the waiter if she can have a glass of water and he says to us ""we charge for water"" I'm not sure if this was a joke or not but he sure didn't smile or say he was kidding!!! What is this!?!?! At this point a couple behind us turned around and said ""we've been here for 30 min and no drinks have even been brought out yet"" After all of these circumstances me and my GF decided we are taking our business else where... years of HAPPY BJs dining I have found the absolute worst BJs ever and I'm telling anyone that reads this review go somewhere else you'll thank me for it!!

Sasha P.,"San Francisco, CA",2,3,,1.0,12/8/2017,"The quality of the experience at this BJ's has declined so much recently, it is mind blowing. I came here the other night with my boyfriend and waited by the host stand for 15 minutes trying to make eye contact with someone who worked there, to no avail. Eventually I just seated myself. Waiter after waiter walked by me at the table and didn't even give me a glance. Finally someone noticed us and I asked for a menu. Soon afterwards, a guy appears at our table and hands us menus but speaks in a very manic way that made my boyfriend and I uncomfortable. Finally, we order a couple beers. The waiter we have disappears for over twenty minutes in the back, and as there is barely anyone else at the restaurant, he certainly is not busy helping anyone else. My boyfriend and I consider walking out, but at this point we are very hungry and do not know where else to go. When he returns without our beers, he tells us that someone else has inexplicably taken them but that more beers will be poured. We then order a couple appetizers. We finally get the beers at about the same time as the food and discover that everything we ordered tastes strangely stale, as if perhaps it had been in the freezer and microwaved for a couple minutes. Our waiter disappears for another twenty minutes and we glance around constantly, hoping for his reappearance with the check.  Though this is a place we used to go occasionally for a beer and appetizer, we certainly will not be making another trip.

Michael A.,"Westlake Village, CA",1300,771,2689,4.0,4/1/2016,"BJ's gets 4 stars overall, though their service is probably more deserving of 3 stars. Came here today for lunch and ordered the soup-salad lunch combo, which includes bottomless soup and salad.  Awesome, except that it took 35 minutes to get my first bowl of soup and salad. After that, service picked up, however, and the waiter seemed sincere about apologizing for the delay. The food itself was decent. The clam chowder was good, but not the best in the area by any means. The salad seemed fresh, and tasted pretty standard. What's really awesome about this place is their home brewed beers, drinks, and desserts. Their famous pizookie lives up to the hype, and is a must-try item when coming here. Their beers are delicious and they offer some pretty cool cocktail choices, as well. Their chocolate ale ice cream float looked good, and I think I'll give that a try next time I go. Unfortunately, I would not really recommend their pizzas. Though deep dish, I'm never really happy with the taste. Below average in my book; their pizza gets 3 stars from me. Their food menu does have a lot to offer, their bar area is sizable, and they have a bunch of TVs constantly playing sports, making this a great place for happy hour, and for watching games. If you have kids, they do have a pretty solid kids menu, and they brew their own root beer and cream sodas. The root beer here tastes amazing. Give this place a try. The menu is big, and you're bound to find something that catches your eye. They have sashimi-grade ahi tuna that I've been dying to try.

The Denius J.,"Anaheim, CA",7,120,6,1.0,10/21/2017,"I'm not from around here but I thought that a BJ's was solid place to go to for good food and decent service. We sat down at about midnight and there were very few customers. There were more employees walking around than actual patrons. Our server was Bobby. My fiend's has a different opinion of him but I thought that he appeared overwhelmed with the three tables he was helping. One of my friends ordered a queso dip with chips as an appetizer. Almost 30 minutes later, Bobby comes out and says that they're out of queso. I fell out of my chair laughing. It took the team of kitchen staff and servers 30 minutes to realize that they were out of queso dip. I was laughing because I was getting that feeling that service was going to be hard to come by tonight. Long story short, our food came out an hour after we sat down. During that hour, we had nothing but our drinks given to us. We spoke with manager MONICA, whose attitude was such that this was not her fault. She was asked if this was her store and she said yes. She agreed that it should not have taken an hour for the food to come out especially when there are only three tables occupied and there was a bounty of employees just standing around. Her response was that she would ""talk to the kitchen staff."" The unapologetic nature of Monica leads me to believe that training from top down at this location is completely inadequate. Our concern walking in at midnight was that it was close to closing and that would lead to poor service or receiving low quality food. We unfortunately got both. The one decent thing Monica did was comp our meal. I don't know if you've ever eaten a meal while angry but whatever you eat tastes bad. If I had to pay for that meal I would never go back to a BJ's ever again and strongly dissuade everyone I know from going there. I typically like the food here.

Simone M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,94,364,2.0,5/27/2016,"CURIOUS as to why there have been no reviews posted since 2013?  Is my phone app reading me wrong? 64 unpublished reviews are mostly 2-star  yet this establishment is always busy.  It must be that they are on a major corner of two high schools, well-known name in neighborhood, and off a convenient freeway exit  -- that they keep getting the crowds.  But why no recent reviews? Since I am one of the original reviews posted here I will update and see if it posts.  We like the free seating in the large bar area. The service is consistently good here.  You can see the TV's; but you can't hear them.  There is a loud din in the restaurant.  No music playing so voices (and children's cries) seem to carry.  But since it is such a large restaurant, the server has to go clear back to the bar or kitchen for refills, etc... The menu is vast and constantly changing  aside from pizza.  Vegetarian options are becoming more available. I have tried the deep fried artichoke hearts (kind of desperate that night... Lol) and they were too salty.  The spinach stuffed mushrooms were good.  No true vegan if you ask me...  Side note:  I'm so concerned about all the steps up and down out of the different levels with no hand rails. Makes me concerned for the older folks who come here.  Also there is a very tricky curb right in front of handicap parking which someone could trip on while getting into their car easily.

Usually two tops are in a quieter spot, not right next to large parties. However they're usually pretty accommodating about other seating.  Dishes are hit and miss. Guacamole, meh. Salsa with chips is terrible--and this is same salsa on other Mexican dishes. Canned flavor. Brussels sprouts appetizer, meh. Pizza is ok if you like deep dish.

PROs--The food at BJs is usually pretty good.  The pizzas are great and so are the burgers.  Their beers are good to.  The place was clean and so were the restrooms.  There were enough TVs to enjoy some sports. CONs--Where do I start....You think it is a coincidence that this place has several 1 stars??  Never been to a BJs this bad...and I've been to a few.  The service was absolutely terrible.  For starters, one person in our group didn't get her meal until almost 25-30 minutes after everybody else.  My child also didn't get his ice cream, even though all the other kids did.  The wait staff was unable and/or incapable to split the check.  It took him several times, and still couldn't do it.  The manager at the time was even worse.  Very surly, rude, and not helpful at all.  She also stated that they ""don't like large groups.""  Really?  Since when?  I've had many team parties at the one in Oxnard, and always felt welcome there...sometimes with 20-30 people deep.   Rest assured I will inquire with their corporate office to ask if they are a family-friendly restaurant and whether they welcome large groups.  Maybe I'm wrong, and BJs doesn't, I'm just curious if that is the case or not, because it has never been before.  A large company turning down a lot of $$$$ from a large group?  Interesting business model. I've worked in the restaurant industry and it really isn't that hard to split a check, especially if you know BEFOREHAND that you will be doing so.  If this was a rookie waiter, fine, but the manager needs to step up and make the situation better, not worse. Would I go back?  Hell no.  Forget this place.  Many other places in East Ventura County to eat.  If you are hell-bent on BJs, go the extra few minutes to the one in Oxnard.  They will treat you better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=20

We arrived at the restaurant around 5:00 PM.  They sat us at a table and we were given our menus.  It took about 20 minutes before our waiter came to our table to take our order.  My mom ordered the clam chowder soup and I ordered my usual, chopped Asian salad.  It took us another half hour to get our meals.  When we finally got our meals, my mom's soup wasn't hot at all! At best, maybe Luke warm if even that!   My chopped Asian salad was the worst! It wasn't chopped at all.  After a while, the waiter came by to ask if everything was ok and we said, no! We told him about the soup and he took it back.  I explained to the young male waiter, with a thin build, and a high pitched voice, that my chopped Asian salad was not chopped! He told me that's a chopped salad and told him I beg to differ! I explained that I've had this salad numerous times and this is not chopped!  He was trying to make up excuses and told me that the chopped Asian salad has changed. I told him that they need to remove the word chopped, if indeed it has changed. He never asked if I wanted something else.  And he never came back to our table to fill up my iced tea that was empty for the duration of our dinner.

From my experience the food is always good and the service has been fine as well. But tonight I probably had the worst service I have ever experienced. My friends and I were meeting up here to celebrate one of our friends. The experience started well, but went all downhill from there. I was here with several friends and we got our 1st set of drinks and proceeded to order food. 1) The waiter 100% forgot about the burger that my friend had ordered. He didn't bring it out for about an hour, and said, ""This is a fresh one, not the one that has been sitting there for a while"". Yet the burger was luke warm and unappetizing.  2) Another friends ordered a plate of burnt sausages as an appetizer. 3) I ordered a small pizza. To find out once I received my check that small pizza's weren't actually on sale. Why would I pay 17$ for a small pizza, instead of 10$ for a large? And why didn't the waiter let me know that a small was not part of the deal? 4) After the first beer our friend asked for a water. The waiter didn't come back. Ever. We honestly watched him walk to his other 4 tables with a tray of water and give them all water, and he neglected us. Needless to say, the water never came until 2 more times of asking. About 40 min later (Beginning to see a trend). 5) One friend asked for a check, 30 min later it finally arrived. She left angry leaving zero tip. And proceeded to ask for our checks as well. 30 min later we got our checks. This was the one and only time I've almost walked out of a restaurant, simply because the waiter was so oblivious that he wouldn't have even noticed that we were missing anyway. I work in customer service, and 5 tables is NOT difficult for any server. So in my eyes there is simply no excuse for this poor of service. My friends and I came for food an pizzokies, and we had terrible food and no pizzokies. I was legitimately too scared to order a pizzokie incase it took 30min longer.   Cliff Notes: Worst service I've ever had in any BJ's location. I rarely saw him, anything we ordered came on average 30 min later or not at all. This guy just left a sour taste in my mouth. Sorry BJ's, I used to love ya.

They are open late which is a plus. The food is pretty good.  The menu is quite extensive and everyone can usually find something they like. The portions are large and I always end up taking half of my meal home. I have tried a variety of items on the menu and everything has been delicious.  I especially like the roast beef dip, the pizza, the wedge salad, any of the soups or chili, and and the crispy fried artichokes, The pizookies are super yummy and it is always hard to choose which flavor to get. The offer a full service bar and if you like beer, the beer samplers are the way to go! Service is usually good and the servers are friendly. Sometimes when they are busy, it can get kind of slow.

The service was the main issue. They did not have enough staffing and our service person was not very proficient and even rolled her eyes when asked questions. Too rushed. etc. We asked for a new person in fact and it was partially granted. The wait for everything was long to the point that we were there for over two hours last night.

Michael L.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/22/2017,"This was my first time at this BJ's restaurant in Westlake and it was bad experience. BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants and I frequent this eatery at least once a week near my home in Orange County. We arrived around midnight to find the place nearly empty. The few customers I observed had either already finished their meal or were ordering dessert. We ordered chips and Queso dip to start. 30 minutes later I asked about the chips and dip and our waiter stated he would go check on the order and apologized because he was too busy scooping ice cream. He came back and said they were out of queso dip. It took them 30 minutes to figure this out. I let that go. We then ordered our food and it took closer to an hour which was now near closing time. I again had to remind the waiter on 3 different occasions about our food. My friends and I observed at least 15 other employees standing around or counting money to close out for the night. We asked to speak to a manager and a lady by the name of Monica came to our table. She made us feel like our complaints were minimal and knew the buzzwords but it was obvious she truly didn't care. I work in administration and this Bj's is obviously ran from the top down and the employees resemble her leadership. I would have had multiple employees helping out the remaining customers instead stating how busy it was earlier that night with all of Westlake high school students that overwhelmed their staff. I observed 3 waitresses counting their money towards the back of the restaurant and walking past our table with cash in hand. Could have been tips. We saw a few at the bar mingling and joking around. We saw a few at the entrance standing their joking. It was frustrating to witness this as we were wondering where our food was. Our waiter also stated that sometimes the kitchen staff packs it up early for night and how it was frustrating for him. Again, a leadership issue. After we complained, our waiter stepped it up. He annoyingly asked if we wanted water refills even though water was in our cup but why does it take a complaint to get a descent service. I normally don't write reviews unless the service is really great or really bad. Time for a new manager or better training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=60

I'd say this meal is the epitome of what bjs brewery embodies (aside from the beer, which we all know is always spot on). Considering I decided to order take out there was nothing I could do to change that though. The deep dish cheese pizza was a delight. It was warm and had soft dough with the right amount of crust along the edges. The pizza is incredible here and the tomatoes are cooked to perfection.  The pizooki I ordered was a pumpkin pizooki topped with vanilla bean icecream. Amazing. Just beyond incredible. Every bite brought me to euphoria. I couldn't stop until it was all gone.

Our food finally came out about 35-40 minutes after. We had asked for extra sauces such as Alfredo, Santa Fe, and ranch. She assured us that they were all in there and after waiting so long we believed that everything was in there like she said. We had also asked for the burger that we had ordered for the meat to be cooked well done, and unfortunately we got home and the burger was rare and very red. Also, no garlic aioli on the burger or even extra on the side like we had asked for.

It was my daughters Bday and she really wanted to go here for the pizzookies so I gave in and decided to try it for a third time.  Well you know what they say ""3 strikes and you're out"" I will not be returning to BJ's in a hurry.  The service was terrible. It took our server a full 10 minutes just to greet us. He took drink and app orders and never returned until we were done with those. We had to ask another server for share plates which took forever. I ordered a margarita but was very specific that I didn't want any sugar in my drink. It was was swimming in sugar. He told me that they didn't put any sweet and sour in it so I asked if the lime juice had sugar in it. His response "" I have no idea"". Seriously!! Menu knowledge is a key component to good training at any decent restaurant especially a chain like this. Instead of trying to fix my drink he just said ""ok I'll take it off the bill"" again, seriously!! Isn't it important to try and accommodate your guests? Come up with an alternative, not dealing with neuroscience here.  Okay, so now we ordered our main course, everything was cleared away (things were looking up). I do like a clean table. Food arrives and no one has cutlery. We ask someone to bring us knives and forks, waiting waiting waiting, food is getting colder by the second. Our server approaches, we ask him, his response ""oh yeah, how many of those do you need?"" Tiresome just writing this, not to be redundant but seriously?? There are 8 people at the table, how about you just bring 8 instead of us having to count it. Food still hasn't been touched.  Now onto the food. Average if that. The crispy chicken salad was comparable to McDonalds. The chicken was completely overlooked, the salad was soggy and tasteless. I would have sent it back but our server didn't check in again so we just ate it.  My daughter got a avocado, tomato, bacon grilled cheese. Bread was soggy, cheese wasn't melted, avocado barely noticeable. Just blah.  The only redeeming thing BJ's had for us was the pizzookies.  Next time we'll do dinner elsewhere and maybe, just maybe come here for dessert but that won't happen for a while, need to get rid of the very bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=140

We are pretty selective about our choices and mostly order salad - we like the Santa Fe or Asian Chicken Salad.   Service is spotty and the food is not consistent when we dine in .  We do like their pizza and pizookie and tomato basil soup. Editing to add.....we ordered in again tonight and once again - we got home and the order was wrong.  They gave us a salad we ordered with the wrong fish on it.  I ordered two salads identical and we got two different versions of the same salad.  Food was good but I was annoyed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=140

Others ordered items which the restaurant screwed up on. Shrimp pasta with no shrimp. This does not include the lack of service we received after the food was corrected and brought out.

Haley R.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,4,1.0,7/5/2017,"This was my boyfriend and I's first time eating at BJ's. My 22 year old boyfriend ordered a beer and the waitress stood there looking at his ID for a while (which is normal), but then she walked off with the ID and didn't give any explanation. She took it over to two other ladies standing by a register. They then all walked over to the bar and stood there with the two bar tenders looking over the ID, looking at us, and laughing. My boyfriend was so confused. Why did it require 5 people to calculate a birth date and approve an ID? He walked over to ask what the problem was. Apparently that wasn't an acceptable question to ask because from where I was siting it looked like an argument. I walked over and asked what the problem was and the response I received was an extremely rude, ""I'm not talking to you."" We said we didn't understand why the ID had been taken away. The female bar tender then threatened ""not to serve us anything at all."" We said we just don't understand what the problem is. The male bar tender said we have to take the ID because it's a chain restaurant. I explained that we eat at chain restaurants all the time and never have this problem. After this whole unnecessary scene they caused, the male bar tender FINALLY tells us their store policy for out of state IDs is to have it scanned in the back. Due to this unnecessary damper on our 4th of July, we decided to leave and we don't plan on returning. Waitresses, if you have a policy that is a bit unusual, make sure you kindly explain it to your customer.

We are both fans of other BJ's locations, but I've only been to this one a handful of times.  At 6:15 my husband placed our ""Dine In Order Ahead"" on his mobile app. We arrived at BJ's at 6:45 (the time we selected on the app) and after 5 minutes of the desk fiddling around not finding our name they handed us a pager and said ""we'll call you when something is ready"" Ummmmmm.  Isn't the the whole point of the app not to wait in line with everyone else? We were not seated for 20 minutes.  On a Tuesday night.  Maybe I'm oversensitive on the issue.  But the point of the app is to ""revolutionize"" my dining experience and then I have bad customer service from the front desk with minimal information as to when my advanced order will be ready and dirty looks like we are inconveniencing them by having used the app.  When our buzzer finally buzzed 20 minutes later I heard the host telling the party ahead of us it would be a 5-10 minute wait. Outrageous! Our waiter brought us menus and asked if we would like to start with any appetizers. We told him that we already ordered on the app & he looked at us and said well what about what would you like to drink and we again told him we ordered our drinks on the app, too. It was very frustrating for us and he really didn't seem to care very much.  They messed up my husbands order which is crazy because again, we ordered it on the app.  In the end the food was fine.

I was glad to see that all that I heard was true!!  But it turned out that the service was terrible.  There were so many open tables but they still made us wait for 30 minutes. And then it took at least 15 minutes for a server to even come up to the table. At that time the server told us ""I will be right with you"" but she still took forever!  By the time the waitress finally came to take our drink order we had been there for almost an hour. And the food took even longer to come out. And on top of that the waitress messed up our order. But I do have to say that once everything was corrected, the food turned out to be very good, and the bill wasn't too expensive. The meals were very large and I couldn't quite finish my salad but I was able to take it home and save it for the next day.  I hope that the service was only a one time deal and that if I decide to go again BJ's will step up their game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=120

Natalie K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",1166,913,2031,4.0,1/19/2013,I have been to so many BJs locations and I honestly have to say that this one is the best by far in terms of service. I'm surprised to see only 3 stars on yelp because my experience was quite great. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived. They gave us a buzzer and we ended up only waiting about 5 minutes before being seated. The host and the server were both extremely friendly. Our food also came pretty quickly. My friend had their pizza and I ordered the salmon. I know their pizza is great but I really wasn't in the mood for it. My friend enjoyed her BBQ chicken pizza a lot. My piece of salmon was huge and it tasted fresh. It is served with this flavorful rice pilaf that has a hint of curry. I ordered a beer but my friend had a blueberry mojito and she loved it. Actually it may be blackberry. I'm not 100% sure but she did say it was one of the best mojitos she's had. My only complaint is that this particular BJs is more like a family restaurant than a restaurant/bar. We went for happy hour and I was surprised to see so many children running around. The table next to us consisted of 6 adults and 10 kids under the age of 8.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=120

Just to name a few of my favs: - Spinach and artichoke dip - BBQ chicken salad- get the half size if possible at lunch and ask for extra bbq sauce - New Orleans Jumbalaya: blackened chicken, shrimp and Chicken- Andouille sausage, sautéed with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce.`Served over rice pilaf and topped with green onions. 13.95- great flavors! - Ahi poke: but the wontons could be crispier and thicker - Thai chickent lettuce wraps- great bite!

Kelsey B.,"Portland, OR",47,30,2,1.0,8/19/2014,"BJ's in Westlake Village is like the terrible friend who doesn't listen to you that you keep going back to in hopes that your relationship will change.  I primarily order through LABite and there is always SOMETHING wrong with my food. When I order fettuccine alfredo, even if I specify my desire for pasta without chicken, it's like they flip a coin to decide whether or not they're going to throw some chicken on top. On top of that, the fettuccine alfredo always has random bits of other food mixed in it (little black things, broccoli, and other unidentifiable crumbs), which really leads me to question how clean their kitchen is. I must be a masochist, because until tonight I've continued to order food from this BJ's location 1-2 times a week and it's almost always either terrible or flat out wrong. On a typical night, they overcook the mozzarella sticks to the point that there's dried cheese on the outside and the sticks themselves are hollow. You asked for your fish with light batter? Surely you must mean extra batter, so that's what we're going to give you. I think the most mind boggling mistake is the fact that I've ordered a Triple Chocolate Pizookie several times, and instead of giving me the double chocolate ice cream it's supposed to come with, they keep giving me vanilla. Even when I add 'double chocolate ice cream' to the special instructions, they STILL give me vanilla. If I wanted vanilla ice cream, I would have asked for it. Oh, and the cookie itself is always burned. How challenging is it to NOT burn a cookie? Eating at the restaurant itself is no better. The waiters are rude and have a bad habit of never refilling drinks or asking if you need anything. On top of that, they'll leave you waiting for your meal for 30 minutes on a slow day and the food is no better when it's fresh. Eating at BJ's is like playing Russian Roulette, except with food quality. Save yourself the frustration and eat somewhere else. Obligatory 'if I could give them no stars, I would'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=180

Patrick N.,"Philadelphia, PA",155,433,533,2.0,8/6/2011,"This time I ordered from the ""Small Bites"" section of the menu. I got the Mac and Cheese for just $4. I was so eager to try it because it sounded so good. It has a blend of three cheeses, bacon throughout, a bacon and breadcrumb topping, and even chipotle seasoning. It sounded so good, so flavorful, I couldn't wait.  When I came I thought it was definitely a good lunch or snack size, and is served with two garlic parmesan crostini's.  I finally took my first bite. What a let down! It was completely flavorless! I could taste only plain pasta. The cheese sauce with chipotle and bacon had no flavor whatsoever. I couldn't believe it. At least it was only $4.  I might try to make this at home because the blend of ingredients sounds brilliant.  If you go to BJ's, stick to the pizza.

Being a waitress myself, I'm very understanding of mistakes but I feel like the problems we have had here are repetitive and do to pure carelessness. The staff here has to deal with a lot of teens who don't tip them because of its location (in between two highschools) so I think they just assume any younger person is the same and they won't put the proper effort into the table but I'm 20 years old and do not like to be treated less then because you don't think I will tip you (as I tip AT LEAST 20% no matter what, it's the right thing to do) I know that it's a huge restaurant so I give them props, but I just wish that I felt more taken care of and attended to when I come here.

Regan R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",58,23,4,5.0,6/17/2015,"Hadn't been here in about 4 yrs cause the pizza was kinda crapy every time we went there and they don't brew beer on site. Visited there today to get a cheese pizza and some brews and it was perfect! I worked there back in 2004 and ate there every shift. Food was yummy and the staff was upbeat. Later, when I moved on and changed jobs, my friends and I would go there and the food and atmosphere kinda went south for a while, so I hadn't been back. But I'm happy to know the food and service is better!  FYI They don't have a hostess between lunch and dinner cause it's slow and there's no need, so you have to seat yourself at the bar- this pretty much goes for most restaurants.  From what I remember when I was a hostess- it tends to be bananatown mainly during basketball games (cause of that big screen tv...oh and booze) so if you hate people and want a quiet dinner, don't go on a big sports night. Some hardcore sports fans can tie up the seating for hours, so you have to expect to wait a little longer for dining.  When I think Bjs, I don't think it'll be equivalent to Mastros, where they give you the birthplace, family history, and the life hood of the meat you're about to eat- I expect pizza-and-beer and maybe a pizookie full of regrets ;) After tonight I know we'll be back.

Worst part was a wealthy looking family same amount of people who sat right in front of us were non stop being helped. Also when we complained our server was rude about it. I've been to bjs in other locations before but never coming back to this one again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=220
Dennis S.,"Dallas, TX",510,854,21,3.0,6/21/2011,"I have been to BJ's several times. It is very reliable for consistently good service and excellent food. I know it is a Brew pup but I have only had one beer there for dinner. It was long enough ago that I don't recall which beer I tried but it was very good. The salads are excellent and my iced tea was never empty. I guess my only complaint is that I sometimes feel a bit rushed to order and turn over the table. There is usually several people waiting for tables so I understand the rush. If I am looking for a place to hang out with a friend over lunch for an hour or more I usually try another restaurant.

We were seated in Blake's area and we are so glad we were. He was phenomenal - friendly, entertaining, polite and efficient. The thing that struck me most was that unlike other servers, Blake took the time to talk to our almost 9-year old son. He made sure he was happy with his meal, made sure he got his food first and treated him like a real person. Anyone with kids knows most servers ignore the kids.  Thanks, Blake for a great Friday night dinner experience! One other thing that impressed me about the restaurant itself is that they were super busy. We got there around 6:15 and the wait was about 20 minutes.  (Not bad for a Friday night). A young lady came around apologizing for the wait and offering people slices of cheese pizza.

Megan E.,"Agoura Hills, CA",93,94,173,2.0,9/9/2014,"Definitely need to update my review after last nights experience. Seriously management needs to do something about that RUDE hostess that they have (She has black hair and is hispanic/asian looking & about 5'3) I unfortunately did not get her name but I'm sure she is easy to point out. I don't understand how she got a job in the customer service industry seeing as in how she seems to hate everyone.  So... My mom, brother and I walked up to the host stand to be seated (it was empty) we waited for about a minute until someone finally showed up (this is SO unlike BJs because there is always someone at that stand.) Guess who showed up? The super happy hostess!-NOT! I kid you not this girl did not even smile when she walked up to the host stand. She didn't even greet us with a hello, she just said how many? (rudely I might add)  After we told her how many people were in our party she began to walk to a table-- let me add that she didn't even say ""right this way please"" or anything... she just expected us to follow. As we made our way to our table she was SO far ahead of us (I was a hostess at one point in life, and I know very well that you are supposed to make the customer feel welcomed and comfortable) and she did NOTHING of the sort. We finally caught up to her as she was slouching with attitude as if she wanted us to hurry up. My mom even caught on and said ""wow what's up with this girl?"" -- we got in our booth and she literally threw the menus down at each of us and stormed off! I kid you not, SHE THREW THEM!! At this point, I just wanted to leave. I was SO disappointed, more so because I always come to BJs and this girl ALWAYS looks SO miserable... and not only does she look miserable, but she acts like it too, and boy does it rub off on the customers. I mean I totally understand that everyone has their bad days, but every time I see this girl she is so unhappy. I am so mad at myself for not getting her name but I do have a perfect (maybe not so appropriate) description of her so that you guys know to watch out! [[If I find out her name, I will update my review with it.]] Basically, if someone were to ask me to describe what she looks like I would say: The short pretty Asian/spanish looking girl with the look of hatred permanently glued on her face who has black hair and is skinnier up top but heavier on her bottom half.  (SORRY! rude & TMI but it has to be said) Management seriously needs to sit this girl down have have a chat about customer service because I can honestly say that I will not be back to BJ's because of this girls nasty attitude.  On the other hand, my server was lovely. She was tall and thin and had super short hair. Excellent service by her.

However, the slaw it domes with it tastes straight out of a bag with no sauce on it. I would recommend trying the bison burger, but substituting for another side. It was a very good price also, less than $10. Word of advice, call ahead if you are coming on weekends or for dinner any day because there are long waits here. If you are sitting at the bar, you're set because its open seating.

When we finally had a bartender come take our orders we asked if we could also place our food orders, she said she would let our server know we were ready to order.

When our server Blakely came to the table, he immediately turned our visit around and was extremely welcoming, cheerful and helpful.

Not to mention the waiter who went to retrieve utensils for the couple stopped in his tracks to hug and chat with some friends who had just walked in.

This evening we ordered the BBQ chicken pizza which is always yummy (deep dish style) and the pizookie (cookie baked like a deep dish pizza and topped with ice cream). Both very yummy as always. It's pretty hard to come to a BJs and not have a pizookie, they are so delicious; you can share one or get a mini for yourself and they have a few different flavors. They also have a full bar with a bunch of great beer options.  I had a fruit beer and hubby had a pale ale which we both enjoyed.

So yesterday 3-25-12 was my friends Birthday, she requested we go to BJ's. I went with an open mind even though my first time there was awful. Well the fact is the place is consistant. Awful service. Disinterested or just imcompetent server. The food took forever to come. The appetizers came with the main meal-except for one of our party of five. Two people ordered dessert-one was complimentry due to the birthday, guess which one they ""forgot"" to bring. We had to wait TWENTY MINUTES for the second one to arrive, we had asked our server to just credit the one that was ordered for the B-day one.  He said he could not do that. His additude was reflected in the tip we left. If you want awful service and mediocre food then this is the place for your. --------------------------------- I had heard great things about this place so I was excited to try it today. It took OVER AN HOUR for us to get a Pizza and an order of Fish and Chips. The Pizza was ordinary and the Fish and Chips were greasey and overcooked.

When we ordered our drinks and the first time our server only brought 3 out of the 5 we ordered. 5 minutes later she brought the second round from the bar. I still had to wait 17 minutes to get a diet Pepsi. When the food finally arrived it was tasty.  We did over hear our table next to asking if anyone worked here and struggling to get someone's attention. Apparently their service was as prompt as ours. We dropped $80 tonight and the service was horrible. The manager just stood watching the train wreck and was doing nothing about it. As we were leaving the two hosts completely ignored us and didn't thank us or even look at us. This place is a joke.

Maria P.,"Simi Valley, CA",8,41,3,1.0,7/1/2015,"My review is solely on the service I received today. The biggest issue was the server that we had "" Shane B"". We sat at a booth at the bar. The whole place was almost empty with at most 10 tables occupied. Most of the servers were just hanging out since it was that dead inside. By hanging out I mean socializing with one another by the bar and on the phone . We ordered only a small pizza which took 30 min to receive. The server we had took 10 min to have us place our order. Normally this isn't an issue but the fact that the place was empty was really frustrating. There was a table behind us that ordered a lot of things and the server went to that table well over five times to ask if everything was OK. Not only that but a few times he would update them on there food coming out. We feel that we did not get the same level of service due to the fact that we didn't order that many items. When we finally received our food and were all finished we asked for the check and Shane walked to the register to retrieve it. Instead of bringing it over to us he began socializing with the guy at the bar. It wasn't until I looked at him with an upset look that he wrapped up his conversations and brought us the tab.

While we were eating our food, I had finished my beer, but had to wait a good ten minutes before the waitress came by to ask if I'd like another.  We were still a little hungry after the first round of apps, so we were trying to get our waitress' attention to get another menu.  When she finally came by, we requested a menu, but she never brought one.  We had to flag down another waitress to ask for a menu.  We ordered another app which was delivered by yet another waitress whom actually did bring us appetizer plates this time. Our original waitress then told us she was going on break and introduced us to her substitute.  I requested our check from the substitute.  When the check came, I put my card in immediately, but then she walked off without taking the check.  I decided to leave it on the table and head to the restroom.  As mentioned in a previous recent review, the restroom could have used a little tidying up as there were paper towels everywhere and the trash was overflowing.  Came back to the table and the check was still there with the substitute waitress nowhere in sight.  Took the check and walked up to the hostess to pay the bill.  A guy who appeared to be the manager took the check so I could pay, but never once asked how anything was.  I kind of thought that was standard operating procedures in most restaurants, but I guess not at this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=260

I am also a server, so I understand that when you're super swamped you may forget a couple things or mix up an order but that was not the case tonight.  We came in for a late dinner just after the dinner rush had died down. After being seated it took 10+ minutes for our server to finally make his way to our table to take our drink order, at which point we were already ready to order our dinner; avocado egg rolls to start, a dinner Caesar salad, the fried artichoke small plate, and a side house salad. He then took quite some time to bring us our drinks, and when they finally arrived there were no straws in them so we had to flag him down and ask him to bring some. There were two of us, and he came back with ONE unwrapped straw in his bare hands! Disgusting. We then had to ask for another one which he brought out in the same way.  The avocado egg roll ""appetizer"" (the only thing worth ordering again) came out just 30 seconds before the rest of the food. What was supposed to be a dinner-sized Caesar salad was the same size as the small house side salad. We decided to overlook the mistake and just eat our dinner because it would have been too much of a hassle to flag him down because he rarely ever came to check on us.  Once we were finished we asked to look at a dessert menu and he said he would be right back to check on us and get our order. 15+ minutes later he came back to get us a half salted caramel/half white chocolate macadamia pizookie. I asked for a refill on my root beer when he took our dessert order, and after waiting for the pizookie to bake, receiving the pizookie, and eating the pizookie my refill still never arrived. When he finally came back to see if we were finished I had to ask for my refill to-go and he said, ""oh, 'they' never brought it to you? Oh that's right, 'they' were changing the keg.""  Right...I'm sure that HE wasn't the one that completely forgot about me. And it wasn't just our table. I heard the tables surrounding us in his section also repeatedly ask for things that he had forgotten to bring.  Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was far below average.

Jaanhvi V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",20,19,1,3.0,1/12/2014,"BJs has pretty decent food (love me some pizookie!) and service can be good, but really nothing outstanding. However, it is open later than most places in TO so I end up coming here often. They have good happy hour (M-F 3-7 PM and Su-Th 10 PM to close) prices and pretty good drinks and on Tuesdays they have half off all wine.  The worst thing about this restaurant is their to-go service. I've tried it about 3 times and will never again do it. The first time, my order was completely wrong, and of course I didn't notice until I came home. I had to go back, and they apologized, made my order (not rushed at all), and did not offer ANYTHING for my troubles. The second time, my order was somehow misplaced and they had no recollection of it, so I had to wait while they made the order. Again, no offer of anything. The most recent time, I ordered online, and the order was in their system, but somehow the kitchen did not have the order so nothing was prepared. No one told me this though. The woman working the carryout station just said ""give me a second"" and disappeared for 5 minutes before coming back and telling me that they weren't sure what happened but they would make the order now. This time they offered me a soda or ice tea while I was waiting (but that too only about 15 minutes into my wait), but I only drink water so I said no thanks. But that's it, nothing else. No free mini pizookie or anything like that, and I waited there for a half hour. I got home and noticed that the bun of my burger, which I had asked to substitute whole wheat for, was not actually whole wheat. Overall, I definitely would not recommend getting carryout from here.

The other times the servers have been inaccurate and inattentive. I am not a horrible patron. I don't ask for tricky substitutions or picky nonsense. But, if I ask for water 3 times and it still doesn't arrive, I do start to get tempted to just hit up the station myself. Meals arrive spaced oddly, either with apps or a long long time after. I've had to practically send up a flare to get a dessert order in. And the consistent irritation is getting hold of my check.

I called Rob the manager today to let him know, and without apologizing, asking if he was ok, or anything of the sort, he immediately starts defending the restaurant saying they inspect their products and nobody else has complained. I always love the ""nobody else has complained"" BS line. That's because not everyone reacts the same way to issues, some people don't like confrontation and some people are just too lazy to be bothered to complain.

Jarrod M.,"San Diego, CA",18,43,3,4.0,2/25/2012,"The convenience of this location makes it an easy choice when at a loss of places to go for dinner. Parking can be a bit of a pain in the small parking lot, but not too bad. The cavernous interior easily fills with the noise of the crowds that seem to be ever present in a place this popular. These crowds seem to also slow the service a bit, which can be a bit trying at times. The food is almost always good and serving sizes are more than adequate. Try the flatbread appetizer pizzas for a great starter for a group, or a meal that is plenty for one person. Fanburgers are always a good go-to and the grilled chicken pasta is tops. The food is good; my only gripe is the menu is not super dynamic. All the beers on tap are great. My personal favorites are the porter, the hefeweizen and seasonals, as available.

My family has been coming to this BJs regularly since it opened,  and we almost always receive good service but today things were terrible.  Our own server paid little attention us and was impossible to find,  leaving us waiting for a long time to order,  get our food and other things we needed, and our check. When she was taking our order I ordered for my 3 year old daughter and instead of waiting for me to tell her what I wanted she moved on to the next person and ignored me. She never brought my daughter water,  even though I asked for it both when we sat down and when she asked me what my daughter wanted to drink when I ordered her meal. We had to shout to get the attention of another server who tried really hard to ignore us, so we could get water after waiting ten minutes and never seeing our own server. The other server made no attempt to hide her irritation that we dared to ask her to help even though she was not assigned to our table. She was rude when we asked and rude when she delivered the water,  I even apologized for asking her to help and explained we hadn't seen our server. When our food came I asked,  nicely, for the food runner to bring me the oil and vinegar I had requested with my salad and he said,with major attitude, ""Did you ask for oil and vinegar?"" As if it was my fault that I hadn't received it. I did ask for it,  and since when does it matter? I'm very polite to servers and I wasn't rude today despite bring treated so badly by them so I was surprised with the attitude. I understand when things take a long time or orders are messed up and I would never hold that against a hard working server. These people were just plain rude,  ans it wasn't one person,  it was everyone we encountered. I've never worked in a restaurant but I have worked in hospitality and retail so I know how hard it is to be in front of customers all day,  but we weren't  asking for anything exceptional or giving  them a hard time.

Suesue E.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,21,,2.0,8/27/2014,"I had my 20th birthday here recently with a party of 20. I honestly did not have a pleasant experience at all. First of all, my server started speaking with ""this is how it's going to go."" No introduction, I never found out her name, nothing. She started explaining how we need to divide ourselves into groups of five because it makes it ""easier"" to split the check that way. I am a waitress myself, and I understand it is difficult to split checks with a large party, but I didn't appreciate how that is the first thing she decided to say. How about a ""Hi, how are you?"" ""Are we celebrating something?"" ""My name is _____ I will be your server.""  We divided ourselves into groups, but she split the checks wrong. I had a mixture of guests at this dinner (some from work, some from school) and she mixed guests who have never met before so it made it very awkward that she messed that up  because people who have never spoke before were discussing their money. Also, she got upset that we changed seats. I UNDERSTAND there is a seat order that the orders are taken, but I was the third seat from the edge of the table. Myself & the 2 people to my left moved over ONE seat to make room for a guest who was on her way. We also did this BEFORE we even ordered our meal. She came back and told us ""Don't move."" and looked at us like we completely jumbled the whole entire party. 3 people literally moved down one seat. That is all. When my guest came (the guest that seat I made room for) she brought another guest, so I had to move over one more seat. She came back and said ""Hold on. Was there another switch?"" I said ""Yes there was. I just moved down one more seat."" and she said again not to move. and I responded ""I moved before you even took orders, so you're fine."" (obviously irritated) & she stated ""Yeah but I took your DRINK orders in an order."" It was really frustrating. People move seats at a restaurant all the time. I experience this at my restaurant. I never tell my guests they aren't allowed to move seats! Obviously I am moving somewhere where I am more comfortable. My job isn't to make your job easier. My job is to be your guest & the server's job is to accomodate the party. Again, I AM A SERVER MYSELF I understand the confusion. The seat switches were minor! It is an easy fix it wasn't a big deal! Our server wasn't friendly and barely cracked a smile which made it feel like every request was such a burden. Not very welcoming at all. My food and pizookie came out and tasted very delicious, but on the other half of the table their burgers were dead cold. and they ordered a pizookie and the entire bottom of the pizookie was black burnt, so they were only able to eat the top layer. Another guest got her food after everyone finished eating, but they did comp her meal so that was okay. The paying process was horrible because of what I said earlier of the checks not being separated correctly (even though we split ourselves into fives for her convenience), and I was really upset that gratuity is included when I felt like it was undeserved. The only thing she did that I appreciated was that she kept up on her refilling of drinks. I am someone who drinks 3-4 cups of water and I never had to ask for a refill. I don't know what this woman's issue was, maybe she was upset she has a younger table and was concerned about her tip...whatever it was it was unacceptable.  Overall, really negative experience.

Plus they offer half off wine Tuesdays. Here are my two reasons why BJ'S gets a mid rating.  1). No WiFi offered. Really?  In this day and age? 2). As a patron I should not have to try to manage the order of the food coming out of the kitchen. Ever. But you need to every time you are here. Otherwise the soup/salad comes out prior to the appetizer which may or may not come out with the entree. And if you advise your server, without fail, you will receive  a learned by rote reason why it happens and it's the timing of how the orders are placed. It is never, ever the servers fault, the kitchens fault or the managers responsibility. Every area passes the buck. So, we order our appetizer. Once received we give the next part of our order. After received we give our entree order. BJ'S, if you bother to read  this you really should make some changes. BTW, I have heard  this from so many of your patrons.

At this point I feel kind of sorry for the waiters because they're obviously being put in an uncomfortable position; they can't exactly kick out the other occupants.  Finally, 35 minutes AFTER our reservation time, they seat us out in the patio. The service is subpar; nobody's hurrying to come take the orders that we've already decided upon while we were waiting for our table. At one point nearly everybody's water cup is empty and not a single waiter comes to fill them back up for 15 minutes. That's kind of ridiculous.

My dad and I had to clean it ourselves... the hostess wasn't bright enough to just move us to another one of the open tables and have the bus boy clean that one again.  Then after waiting for over 10 minutes, without any waiters attention, someone was seated right next to us and had service within a minute.   Our first trip there was several months ago.  The service then was slow and similarly inattentive.  The food was ready on time I'm sure but it was cool when it was finally delivered after a barely excusable delay. Two trips in a row with the same bad experience and no manager to be seen... maybe their staff just doesn't care when the manager isn't around.  Or maybe the manager doesn't care.  If I ran a restaurant and had waiters and waitresses texting on their phones as paying customers waited without any service I'd be looking at getting new waiters and waitresses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=380

He gave us exceptional service and after I complimented him and thanked him for such great service, I learned it was his first night behind the bar! This is what led me to write this review! I have been here several times, mainly because its the only place open this late in town, but tonight it was noteworthy! I had a mini pizza for $6 on the happy hour menu and got to pick any items I wanted all for the same price! Also had the buffalo wings, and avocado egg rolls. All very good! It was definitely Kevin who made my friend and my experience such a great one! Also, I told the manager, Kyle, on our way out about the great bartender he had and he agreed and said very nice things about him as well. It's so nice to see a manager appreciate and acknowledge when they have good employees and give them there due respect! I've been in the industry for a thousand years and it's very rare to experience management that truly cares and takes the time to listen to a an employee compliment and be in agreement.

In fact the appetizer came out first which was surprising given the lack of patrons at the time. Son's food came out wrong,  (server rang it in wrong) and we mentioned to Michelle the supervisor who was extremely good at her position. She offered him a pizookie which went a long way with him! As a server myself, I try to be impartial and understanding, knowing that every place has a bad moment now and then. So I was a little disappointed but not enough to not return.

Having worked in a customer service position, I know how to treat customers and the way this manager treated me was not right. Not only was he rude, but he was extremely condescending and was very unwilling to accommodate us. There are upwards of ten TVs playing a UCLA game, while we wanted to watch another game. I realize we live in Los Angeles, but I would think that a franchise who wants to appeal to a large audience would be a tiny bit more accommodating. Let's put their mediocre food and not so great service aside - I love coming to BJ's to watch a game. But now, knowing that this manager is working there, I am so unwilling to return. We weren't the only ones complaining: another party wanted to watch the same game and he said, and I quote, ""just relax, it's basketball"". If that's the case, then change the channel on ONE TV. Regardless of this game or this whole situation, the customer service at this location is abysmal.

Something is most likely to happen every time I come. Don't get me wrong, I'm a server as well. I understand when food takes awhile because it is crowded, or the chefs are just taking their time. I completely get that. But make your tables aware of it at the time instead of just telling them what's going on. And I do believe that even though there are expos at this location, that the servers should also check up on their food and bring it at, especially when the salad comes out after the meal when they know it's a starter.

Caleb H.,"San Francisco, CA",1,4,1,2.0,9/27/2010,"Let me first start by clarifying that this review is not a reflection of the restaurant in general, but rather this specific location. The girlfriend and I eat at this location approx. once a month and while the food is always killer, service problems plague this location. Here's the experience from last night which, unfortunately, isn't that far off from normal: We arrived around 7:40pm, no reservation, and were seated in about 10 minutes (the only good thing about the evening). The restaurant was active, but definitely not full. Our server (I believe his name was Michael) took our drink/appetizer order. Shortly thereafter he returned with the drinks and left without a word. 15 minutes later, the server returned to the table to clarify our order before he entered it, which he had completely wrong. I understand the need to clarify orders from time to time, but to wait 15 minutes before even putting in the order to the kitchen? No way.  Fast forward 35 minutes: our food is delivered to the table, about 5 minutes after the appetizer. No apology for the wait, no explaination for delay, not even a ""can I get you another beer""?  I ended up speaking to the manager, who comp'd one of our entrees, which must have pissed off the server since, when boxing up our pizza, he flipped it upside down in the box (while making eye contact), messing the whole thing up.  I've resisted writing reviews before and have always chalked up the poor service to the server having a bad night and tried to be understanding (having worked in food service). But I honestly can't give this BJ's location more than 2 stars since good service is an integral part of the dining experience.

Edit: be careful in large groups - I got overcharged when I split the bill and split the 18% tip, which was included in the total, but then was charged the tip again. The server made out like a bandit after lying to me about how it was supposed to work (not to mention that I only signed to pay 64, but was charged 75).

However, the whole experience last night was bad. We got a table after about 15 minutes waiting. We sat down and our server came by a few minutes later. He was very nice and talkative. Since I had my wife and two kids with me I decided to place our entire order with our drink order. We waited for over 15 minutes to get our drinks (iced teas/water.) About 20 minutes after that the food slowly started to arrive. We finished the 1st course of our meal and continued to wait. Our server never came by to check on us or re-fill out beverages. Our pizza was finally brought out my someone else. After eating our pizza, we still couldnt find our server to  put our pizzoki order in for us which came with our dinner. He should have been aware of this since it takes like 20 minutes to bake it.  My wife finally complained to the hostess to get a manager. That took another 10 minutes to get her attention to our table. The manager comes over offers an apology and says I will get your bill, a box for your leftovers, and your dessert. The server whom I had'nt seen in ages comes by and apologizes saying they are really busy. They were busy but it he I also noticed him socializing with several other tables in the restaurant. If he were that busy he should'nt have time to do that! My wife eventually had to take our kids to the car after an hour and half being there and it would have been longer if we had'nt said anything. The manager didnt even offer to comp our drinks which was never re-filled once. Disappointed to say the least. I am normally not the type to complain but this experience was terrible.

Stefani S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/5/2014,"BJ's has been my boyfriend and I's favorite restaurant for the past two years, but as time has gone by, we have realized that it is solely for the food quality.  Their food is phenomenal, but tonight confirmed that we need to start going somewhere else. Out of the countless times we have been to this location, there have been maybe three good experiences with regards to service.  Both my boyfriend and I have been serving tables for about three years now, so we are not clueless people who do not understand server struggles like being very busy or making a little mistake.  The service at this BJ's is absolutely TERRIBLE nine times out of ten.  Our first experience that really threw us off was with a girl server.  We did not get greeted for over 20 minutes, but as servers we tried to be patient and understanding and just let it go.  We told her our drink order but she did not let us get to our food order, then had us waiting for our drinks for over 10 minutes.  When she finally brought them, she turned around immediately and it took her 15 minutes to come back and get our food order that we already knew since the moment we sat down.  After we got our food, she did not check on us even once.  The next time we saw her was about 20 minutes after we finished eating when she dropped the check and turned around.  Again, just terrible. Tonight, we had another terrible experience.  We went in for pizookies only, and were there for an hour and a half.  We waited for 10 minutes to be greeted, and our drinks took 15.  Luckily, we got our pizookie order in with the drinks, and asked our server to please make them undercooked.  However, the pizookies took 25 minutes.  When we got them, my boyfriend's was crunchy like a cracker.  We immediately got his attention and he apologized and went to get a new one.  After about 10 minutes (I was already done with mine), my boyfriend got another that was slightly overcooked, but he was not wanting to make another problem so he just tried to eat it.  It was white chocolate macadamia nut, not peanut butter like he ordered.  At this point it was almost funny.  We got it replaced again, and the pizookie came out slightly overcooked again.  He ate it even though it was not even close to what he wanted.  The one pizookie was taken off the bill, but never did the manager come to talk to us, let alone take care of the rest of the bill which I think would be absolutely necessary in this terrible of a situation. Anyway, we are tired of the service at this BJ's location and do not plan on returning.  The two stars are only given because the food is great... so good job to the BJ's cooks...?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=360

Ajay G.,"Spartanburg, SC",102,310,133,4.0,9/12/2009,"My dad's very fussy about where he eats out, including some pretty contradictory things like bundling a lot of add-on items into the entree and including unnecessary amounts of service at virtually no price with virtually no calories. Somehow we always build a list of about 20 places for going out, and eliminate all of them except BJ's as causing too much fuss from him. So I've gotten a lot of BJ's over the years, and have learned a few things from experience along the way. I say that we always go to BJ's, but oh, no... it's always this BJ's. The one in Woodland Hills didn't cook something the way he remembered, so now it's just this. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven't really noticed anything different about the BJ's locations, except that this one's always busy in the evenings and nights, more so than the others. The service is consistently great, and the interior's very tasteful, but that's held for all the other BJ's I've gotten in other places. The first big thing I've learned is just to skip the pizza. They make such a big deal about it, but they've got a very broad menu, and the pizza's the weak spot in it, regardless of the size. I got to like them a lot more after I started spreading to the rest of the menu. The second is that the microbrews are good, but not outstanding. I've had most, and none are bad, but they vary. I think I had the best experience with the porter. They have surprisingly good wings, too, so you might want to combine them with that. The third is that they'll surprise you with a few of the menu items which turn out a lot better than you expected. They seem like such a sandwich place, but probably the best I've had as far as it concerns BJ's involved some solid noodles -- the grilled chicken pasta, or equivalently good, the blackened chicken pasta. Most recently, I had two surprisingly good -- and large -- fish tacos. My sister, who's a pretty reliable judge of taste, was similarly impressed by the shrimp tacos. The stuffed baked potatoes are also enormous, but I've never tasted those giant spuds. Lastly, the highly-touted Pizookie is overrated, but does the job. I've tried all the Pizookies by now, and like the macadamia best but they all sort of taste the same. I didn't really get the appeal, but I think I wasn't really keeping it in the context of what it is. It's not love. It's not acceptance. It's not the meaning of life. It's not even chimi-cheesecake. It's a big, warm cookie, a la mode, served in a mini pizza pan. Keeping in mind that you're just tasting someone's nice warm cookies with cold cream on top, it's actually pretty good. The edges are the best part, though, so if everybody else is done, you might want to just grab the handles and dig your face right in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=400
Ashlee F.,"Moorpark, CA",132,3,1,1.0,1/20/2015,"Tonight was the third time i have visited b.j.'s in Westlake in hopes that the service would not be as terrible as the last two times. Unfortunately i experienced the worst restaurant experience i have ever had. Our server was clearly overwhelmed, and the fact that they were slow on this random Monday night did not help ease her pain. Our party of ten told her from the beginning that we were all going to want separate checks. We also informed her that we all work as servers and would help her out the best we could by not switching seats or over staying our welcome. Each drink we ordered took 20-30 minutes to get to our table. The food we ordered took 37 minutes (we timed it after the fiasco with the drinks) and when our food arrived cold, we asked to speak with the manager. Our server sent over Ron McBride, possibly the worst restaurant manager of all time. He asked us if our food was cold, or just not hot. We asked if it mattered and insisted he take it back and bring us a new dish. After much hesitation, he agreed. At the end of the meal, she brought us one check and asked us to put numbers next to what we ordered. We did, and handed out back to her. We waited over thirty minutes for her to bring our separated checks. When she did not, i approached the manager Ron McBride, explained the situation and asked for our checks. His immediate response was ""if you leave without paying you will be arrested"" i had not threatened to leave, only explained how long we had waited and how frustrated we had all become. I insisted he help our server so we could leave and he walked away from me. After another 20 minutes,i approached him again and asked about our checks, his response was an agitated ""i have not been rude to you, you will have to wait"" i insisted on the checks and told him we would be contacting the corporate office. Again, he walked away from me. The checks arrived shortly after that. There were drinks on our bills we had never received, and it took another ten minutes to have them removed. A couple sitting near us approached our table to tell us that they had arrived when we had first given our server the bill with the numbers separating our checks, and were now finished and leaving. They told us after the fiasco they had witnessed between us and the manager, Ron McBride, they would never return to the chain again. I would encourage everyone to think twice before entering this chain. Any company that would employ a restaurant manager this under qualified and ill equipped at dealing with customers is clearly not worthy of any person's time or money. I am very disappointed with this experience and would urge the company to take a closer look at their management team.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=400

I've been coming to BJ's for many years, probably dining with them well over 200 times. It's a great place for hosting small business meetings, or just having a nice lunch or dinner with your family. You couldn't ask for a better menu, especially when it comes to prices which are pretty reasonable for the portions. The staff is always friendly and attentive, even when they are super busy and fully committed. The pizzas are bomb (although fattening as they might be), the pizookies are definatly a winner, and the salads are my personal favorite section (try the BBQ choppd chicken salad, amazing!!!). I also love the fact that over the last few years they have really started to improve the restaurant building itself, small changes make a world of difference, new floors and decor has really taken BJ's to the next level...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=480

Kristina R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/26/2013,"I've been to BJ's multiple times as I work down the street and go in at lunch time during the weekday. This is the first time I've gone in on a Sunday afternoon and will not be back during this time. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because I really like the food. My husband and I walked in and were greeted by the host. We sat at the bar top. The bartender Craig, although he seemed nice, he only had the bar top and there were a total of 3 people including us. My husband had to ask 3 times for water before he finally brought him water. The third time when my husband asked for water Craig had asked 1 or 2 waters my husband said ""2 waters please"" and even put up 2 fingers indicating he would like 2 waters. The bartender only brought 1. We had to ask yet again for another water. He was more concerned with his coworkers than with us. Which is weird because you would think he would pay more attention to us since we were 2 of the 3 people at the bar top. We ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and great as usual. I ordered the California club pizza which is always good and my husband ordered the mini pepperoni pizza. Now here's what really ticked me off...I was watching the Nebraska/Oklahoma softball game the entire time I was there. A guy came up to the bar and asked the channel to be changed. No big deal because there's 4 screens at the bar. Craig said the manager had to change it. He didn't ask me or my husband if we were watching anything on the tv. That's the channel that was changed and it was towards the end of the game. At that point I was pissed at the lack of service throughout the entire meal that I loudly said ""really? I was watching that game"" and Craig was standing 2 feet away from us and I know he heard. He didn't bother saying oh I'm so sorry let me get the manager to change it back...nothing!! All he said was ""oh can I get you change"" I turned to my husband and said let's get out of here and we left. I will not be back during this time again. I love their food and overall service is okay to good to great even but today wasn't the case. It was more of a service thing to me when I went there today. Please train your bartenders to be more interactive with their guests instead of focusing on chatting with their coworkers.

Smush P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/9/2013,"Dear Yelp Officianados, If you have the opportunity to visit this extraordinary pizza planet, definitely ask for Kobe. She may not have 5 NBA rings, but she is still a champion in my book. She was nothing but friendly, efficient, and beautiful. Just like Mr. Bryant is an efficient basket maker, so Kobe makes every trip to the table count. Kobe (not the beef but just as tender) suggested their seasonal mojito which was the ""bomb diggity"". Our food came out in a timely manner, and as an added bonus, it came on plates this time. Even though the kitchen forgot to put bacon on my pizza the first time around, she grabbed the offensive rebound and brought my bacon to the table, for the win. Kobe told us that bacon is the best and we agreed. Someone below said that Costco has better pizza. While that remains to be seen, the question begs to be asked: does Costco have Kobe? The answer is no my friends. So the next time you are choosing between Costco and Bjs (like the lovely people below) ask yourself this question: Ko-be or not Ko-be? Even though Kobe is not a 6 ft 6 basketball player, she has a tall standing with us!

Christi C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",31,20,29,4.0,5/4/2011,"I've been here quite a few times for Lunch. The lunch prices are reasonable and the food is really filling, so even if you order the smaller lunch sized portion you'll probably still take some home. The menu is ginormous, it takes forever to skim through all the delicious choices, just when you think you've got it narrowed down, turn the page and boom there's something else you have your eye on! So the selection of food items is quite extensive compared to other restaurants. I've ordered the burger, the BBQ Chicken sandwich, and the Chicken Parm and they have all been delicious.   Our servers are always very attentive and friendly. My favorite drink is iced tea and they make a point to fill up my glass every time they walk by the table, because there's nothing I hate more than not getting adequate refills. One time I ordered a bottle of Cream Soda and they informed me they were out of the Cream Soda, so they brought my second choice, Black Cherry on the house.  The noise level is not so bad if you come in the afternoon...I assume it's much worse when there's a bigger crowd in the evening or a sports game on, but for us it's always been a pleasant Lunching spot. Most times we come here, we get a table right away, or within a few minutes. One night we came here for dinner and it was right around Westlake's Homecoming so there were big pre-dance dinner parties being held. We thought it would take forever to get in, but just as we walked up to ask about a table, a large group of teens came walking out the door and we were seated right away.  From burgers to sandwiches, salads to pastas, BJ's has something for everyone! And don't forget to save room for their famous Pizookie, which is a warm cookie baked in a pizza pan and served hot at your table with vanilla ice cream, sooooo good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=420

The bar area has been pretty good for watching sports as well until I walked in the other day to watch some of the Sweet 16 teams in the NCAA tourney. In my opinion, these are pretty big sports events yet the management and staff refused to turn on the volume, opting for ""mood enhancing Kenny G"" musac that typical bar and grills play. I was literally told by the manager ""the game audio only comes on for important games"". This was a huge slap in the face considering I was dressed in fan gear of the team playing at that moment.  We walked out and went to Fox Sports Grill a couple miles away off Lindero Canyon Road.

KaSushi M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/3/2012,"If I could give a no-star rating, this BJ's would be the honorary recipient. This restaurant consistently gives the worst service available in Ventura County (and before I get cast as a BJ's antagonist, I have been to the Oxnard location several times and had a great experience every time). I have been here more times than I'd care to admit, and on a select few occasions I've gotten to deal with humans who have personalities (Michelle, a former bartender, is awesome and deserves to be back at the bar, btw). That said, this place is astonishingly consistent at making sure you feel like you're intruding on employees' chat time.  Several friends and I went there last night after summarily running out of ideas in a night-life-deficient place like Thousand Oaks, and upon WALKING IN, we were already being ignored. 3 separate employees walked by us at different times and asked if we had been helped, and when we said, ""not yet"", all three walked away like there was some pressing issue in a half-empty BJ's at 10:40 on a Saturday they had to take care of before someone could give us one of the 20 or so empty booths. First guy comes back to seat us after an awkward few minutes up front, and we're finally seated.  We order drinks first (and in fairness, our waiter wasn't rude, condescending, or flagrantly uninterested as has often been the case in the past) and we get them pretty quickly. Unfortunately, this was the only thing they got right.  We walked in at 10:40, got our drinks at 10:50, and ordered food around 10:55. Not all of us were hungry, so our whole table only wanted an order of potato skins and an order of guacamole eggroll-type things. You would think this would be no problem, but we didn't receive the food till about 11:30. A half an hour after we ordered 2 appetizers, we get the eggrolls, which my friend said were okay. The potato skins, on the other hand, were DISGUSTING. It looked like they deep-fried the potato before they put any toppings on it, which gives it the look of an old piece of a work boot that's been deep-fried into carbon crunch, then topped with cold bacon and a *pinch* of cheese. There seemed to be real potato inside, but they fell apart the moment you bit into them because of being deep-fried. We all joked about how nice it would be to be in a TGIFridays at that moment, as well as how we never thought we'd say something like that. But seriously, those potato skins called into question several other food items I've had there.

First of all, the reason I would come to bj's is 1) the extensive menu of food and bear 2) the atmosphere of (in my case sunday night football) I went with my brother and my little sister to go finish up the game. We walked inside and we asked if we could be seated in the front booths (which some where open) because we wanted a view of the very large tv above the bar.  We were told that that was not possible because we seating was done by which server needs people. I asked for the manager they said he was on break. Reluctantly and hungry I sat down at the designated seat.  This seat was both by the bathroom, by the back door and by the register. It smelled like a toilet, it was freezing as hell, and the shear amount of servers brushing my backside as well as customers trying to get to the bathroom was uncountable. To try and drown my pain (after waiting 20 minutes just to get asked what drinks we wanted) I decided to order a brewed-in-house beer. I asked for the one that had a asterix next to it as the most popular.  When the beer came with mine and my brother and sisters food, it was warm and had that taste of it being set out for a good 15 minutes, no fresh tap taste to it at all.  the service was poor, the food was alright (portions very small).

Taymoor J.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",11,9,,2.0,12/2/2011,Food is all right. I usually go after work during happy hour. I'm pretty sure they have one server work the entire bar area. I waited 45 minutes for a water. No exaggeration.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westlake-village?start=420
