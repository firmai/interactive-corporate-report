Building was clean and nicely decorated. Fries and certain other sides were bottomless and our waitress Gabby C asked us if we would like another round of our sides before we could even finish what we currently had.

31,Kelly S.,"Mahomet, IL",59,56,,3.0,2016-08-10,"I've always wanted to try a Red Robin, having seen enticing commercials about their gourmet burgers. I love a good ""house"" burger. On Monday of this week, Red Robin in Champaign opened for general service. They don't yet have call-in carry out, but they'll do carry out if you go in to order. TLDR: I'd give the experience 2.5 stars if I could; we're calling this a ""weak 3"" around the house. Given this rating, we don't anticipate becoming regulars. Overview Red Robin is not a fast food joint. There's no drive through. The default expectation is dine in. The fare is upgraded bar food (or pub grub) with a focus on good burgers made with fresh ingredients in tried and true flavor combinations. They also have turkey, veggie, and lettuce-wrapped burgers. Burgers come with a side; three of the sides are at no extra charge and these include garlic herb fries and coleslaw. Both of these items are just okay -- nothing special. I couldn't taste much garlic or herbs on my steak fries and the coleslaw was standard mayo-based restaurant coleslaw with a medium shred.  Red Robin serves more than burgers: salads, wraps, other sandwiches, soups, appetizers, and even a few entrees (like fish n chips and mac n cheese). There will probably be something on the menu that everyone in your party will enjoy. They also have a bar (separated from the restaurant) and for the bar seem to mainly promote their beer selection. First Tastes For burgers, we ordered the DGB (oven-roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic aioli, and fresh arugula tossed in citrus olive oil dressing on a toasted ciabatta bun) and a straightforward cheeseburger on a sesame seed bun with ketchup and pickles (yes, for the progeny, who doesn't care for novel culinary experiences). We asked for the burgers ""pink"" and added caramelized onions to the DGBs. The progeny liked his burger and fries just fine. His single-word response was ""good."" For all that he's a teen with a picky palate, he also has a refined one. He can tell quality, and I've come to trust that his assessments are on point. We thought our DGB gourmet burgers were slightly overcooked (they offer a choice of cooked all the way, slightly pink, or pink--we chose pink and got very nearly all the way), greasy (whether the grease came from the onions or the burger we couldn't be sure but the sandwich was greasy enough to soak the bottom bun and send runoff into the fries), and lacked balance. There was an astringent tart and sour note to the toppings. Was this note produced by the oven-roasted tomatoes or the citrus dressing on the arugula? Whatever caused it, the tart and sour note overwhelmed every other flavor: the savor of the beef, the pepper of the arugula, and the roasted garlic of the mayo. I suspect that whatever produced it broke the mayo, which dripped down loosely in curds off the patty. Even the caramelized onions couldn't stand up to the note, and that's too bad, because they really are caramelized and not just grilled onions. The manager told me their kitchen caramelizes the onions with brown sugar in batches and then reheats them on the grill to order. The flame-grilled burger patty itself, I should add, was of a square and somewhat compressed variety. It was thicker and heftier than a Wendy's patty, but also had a chewier consistency. It wasn't the hand-formed, soft, luscious patty I would have preferred. Bottom Line At $42 for a family of three (for one sandwich with one side each included, no drinks, no tip because carry-out) this was an expensive meal compared to fast food. Was it worth the price for the extra gourmet factor? No, I didn't think so. The burgers were of a generous size (half a pound), the meat (Black Angus beef) was decent quality, and the toppings were also made with fresh, good quality ingredients -- the price point is just too high for this to be satisfying, especially given the poor technique used in constructing our gourmet burgers. Although we didn't dine in, I can say that this place was hopping. By 430, the parking lot and restaurant were packed. Inside it was incredibly, deafeningly loud. The music was loud. The several flat-screen TVs were loud. The staff was loud. The customers were loud. The decor suits an extroverted atmosphere like a better-lit, less cluttered TGIFriday's, with oversized toys (two 2' tall army men, a giant Rubic's cube) and pop art (two mosaics of Roy Lichtenstein portraits made out of crayola crayons and a vinyl stacked hamburger foot stool). The look is fun and energetic, but also modern. Expect that in these early days, the new staff is still working out some kinks. I was initially told that there was no carryout option, but the manager was nearby and corrected the front desk staff. He made sure to accommodate us, and we're always glad of a place that shows it wants our business through good customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-champaign?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

16,M B.,"Champaign, IL",4,19,10.0,2.0,2016-08-13,I had their original burger (figured I'd go with what put them on the map!). The patty seemed on the thin side and didn't fill the bun. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. Cost around $10 with their bottomless fries. My dining companion  had one of their upscale offerings with blue cheese and portobellos. It had two smallish pieces of mushroom on it and the patty itself didn't look to be a half pound as advertised. And it was over $16 with the $2 surcharge for sweet potato fries?!?

38,Heavy Z.,"Champaign, IL",2,5,1.0,2.0,2016-08-29,"First review here (applause) thank you. There's a reason for it. To paraphrase Python, this is not a restaurant for enjoying. It's a restaurant for laying down and avoiding. So Yelp may file this under robot or paid-shill category but here's proof: I've been to Red Robins before that were GOOD. That being said, even though this one is new, and you give a restaurant benefit of the doubt when they're new because some things aren't ironed out yet (the wait staff doesn't know all the details, orders come slowly, or whatever), this place had none of those issues. It was working like a well oiled machine. CLEARLY everyone from the front desk to the waiter had been schooled.  It's just that the ""schooling"" was done horribly wrong in this case. Seemingly not like other Red Robins. (Tho I admit it's been a few years since I've been to a different location) Start with the minor beefs. (ha ha pun not intended) Front desk. ""Polite"" as in ""officious"". No welcome, just kind of a stare and a snide smile, as if they thought they were too good for everyone. They spend more time entering data into their little terminal so they can text you when your table is ready, than it would take to just jot it down on a piece of paper like a restaurant that isn't run by a machine. Then they wind up shouting out names anyway. Get to the table and the waiter comes back every minute to see if we are ready to order. Already getting the vibe that they are trying to turn tables as quickly as possible -even though there are plenty of tables with no one at them.  And a (less than predicted) 20 minute wait to get to a table when there were plenty free, even though we were told there was nowhere we could sit while we waited for a table to become available. Our waiter offered burgers done with ""some pink"" or ""no pink"" or something along those lines. I've never heard this terminology. Trying to be clever and invent something new just for the sake of being different, when something different isn't needed? At least he understood when I said ""well done"". We had a question about the sizes of milkshakes. Perhaps there was a regular & ""monster size"". The waiter was clearly prepped for that question because he enthusiastically answered ""For only a dollar more you get TWICE AS MUCH!"". Let's nip that in the bud right now.  The ""twice as much"" milkshake is LESS than you get at Steak & Shake or Courier Cafe.  If there is a milkshake that's actually half that size, it would fit in a juice glass, 8 ouncer easily. What a joke. So the burgers come and we were with a couple that likes to say a quick grace before they eat. No worries. Bad habit #2 of our waiter revealed: he consistently comes to the table and disregarding whatever conversation (or prayer) might be going on simultaneously, or even waiting for a pause, just shouts down the conversation with whatever he wants to get through. He did apologize for interrupting but really is it that hard to notice when everyone has their heads down? That would be a recurring pattern throughout the time we were there. Someone would be mid-sentence and he would just barge over them, interrupting whatever they were saying to ask if everything was ""okay"". Yes, go away, a good waiter will just pass by regularly to make their presence known so you can flag them down, maybe check in once. A REALLY good waiter you won't even notice, but they will NOTICE when something needs attention just based on signals they pick up. That level of expert service is not expected here. What IS expected is a polite pause so we can finish a sentence to recognize him vs. being interrupted. Getting back to the food itself, burgers were fine, the major gripe we had was the ""bottomless"" fries and broccoli. (The only other thing we got besides the MONSTER shake) They are called bottomless because literally they come in a small round piece of metal, like a cylinder, but it has no bottom. The bottom is the tray it sits on. So you just pick up the metal and the fries come out.  And there aren't that many of them. Like VERY FEW.  And unfortunately when we asked for more (both fries AND broccoli) they showed up long after our meal was done. We figured they actually forgot about them it took so long. OK I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on this before Yelp cuts me off. The cap on the waiter story is at the end when he's walking you through how to use the wireless terminal at your table to pay for the meal (which for some reason couldn't print a receipt despite having paper) he tells you that the machine is going to give you a survey, and LITERALLY word for word he tells you he needs you to give him 9's or 10's, or else he wants you to talk to him first. Awful fancy request. I'll wrap with a list of burgers in town that we could have had that would have been a way better experience: Meatheads! Five Guys! Steak n Shake! Courier! Wendy's, McDonald's, Po Boy's, BK, DQ...don't go for hype people. Red Robin is a tourist trap.

The server was pleasant enough, but did not check once to see if I needed any refills (aren't the fries supposed to be bottomless?) or even to see if I was enjoying the food. Honestly, there are several places in the C-U that offer better burgers and fries and are comparable in price or less. Overall, not a bad experience, but not one that makes me want to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-champaign?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.248,2.56

I ordered the smoke n pepper burger cooked medium and my typical diet soda.  The wait person was fast, attentive, and knowledgeable.  My meal came out quickly to order.  What?  No mistakes to complain about?  Hot, juicy.  Loved the bun. The vegetable toppings perfect.  I even got a second order on the steak fries. I usually hate steak fries as they are never cooked properly.    When it costs so much to eat a premium burger out, ($21.39 including tip, no desert), it has to be perfect or I'm not happy.   It in fact was perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-champaign?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.452,2.8

However, I got a salad the next time I went and it was pretty good. The garlic fries are an absolute must!! (99 cents more).  I rated 3 stars because their service was really slow. 1 lady maintaining the bar and the bar area was pretty full. She was our waitress. We continually had to ask (whenever a waiter/waitress came by) for this and that because they forgot it. Someone, I believe a manager, asked my husband if he wanted a refill on his drink, and he said yes. My husband waited about 10 minutes for it and we saw the guy twice before our waitress got it.

My nephew ordered a chicken entree and it was not delivered with the rest of the food. It was clear by the food delivery person's face that the order had not even been keyed in.  When our waiter realized the error he didn't say sorry, he just said he stole one from someone else's order so it would be out fast (it wasn't, and how does that do anyone any good anyway because now 2 people don't' get their food on time?) and then left our table as quickly as he could.  Another server or maybe the manager (unsure of which because he never introduced himself) came over and said sorry and asked if we needed anything. We made another desperate request for sweet potato fries, but alas, we were again given the ""they are on the way"" spiel but never saw them.   They did take my nephew's chicken entree off the bill without being asked.  But that was it.  There are plenty of good places in Champaign to get a good burger, so I'm not sure we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-champaign?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

My first experience, at this location, was right after they opened and, frankly, I couldn't see the big deal. This time, however, was much better. This time I chose the bruschetta chicken sandwich, fries, and coleslaw. Bruschetta sandwich - 4 with a 1 star deduction for sogginess in the bottom half of the bun.  Coleslaw - 5 since who knew adding stone ground mustard to a very traditional coleslaw recipe would make that much difference.  Unfortunately, the famous Red Robin fries only rate a generous 2 since, for my money, French fries should have some crispness and these were too thick and lacked the desired crisp surface.  But the thing that really draws the overall rating down was the service. The restaurant didn't seem particularly busy, but it was a long time from ordering to service and then the server disappeared when it was time to ask for the check and again when the cash was available. I finally flagged down a different server and paid the bill.  This resulted in a 1 deduction in the rating. I guess I could have used the ubiquitous tabletop credit card terminals but I don't like them and I tend to deduct from the server's tip when the gadget does some of the work",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-champaign,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
