93,Tammy C.,"Kent, WA",118,138,89.0,4.0,2012-03-27,"I am a fan of the Dirty Bird. However, I would recommend only eating in the bar and (I am really just about to say this) only when the male bartenders are working. Our last experience in the dining room was a complete dining out FAIL.  The times we have eaten in the bar while the female bartender was working, our service was sub-par and we had to ask several times for different parts of our order. On the other hand, we love Dillon.  He does a great job at making customers feel welcome, making suggestions, and making sure your order is right and you leave happy. I also highly recommend signing up for the Red Robin perks card.  We have enjoyed free appetizers and look forward to other bonuses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=100,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

Went out for lunch with my co-workers.  Asked for the gluten free menus and had some yummy burgers.  I love that you can get a bunless burger. Id rather save the calories for the fries instead of the burger bun. There was a slight mess up on my order,but the staff here was super friendly and quickly corrected it!  The place itself is cozy and has its own old school personality. I cannot compare to other red robins as it was my very first experience.

She offered accommodations for our needs. (Baby) and made sure we were comfortable. Our server was also very kind and helpful, she helped us with menu questions and checked up on our table appropriately. Not annoyingly buzzing around us or the opposite, hiding in the kitchen or back like some employees actually do. Water was refilled :) Our food was good. Fries were HOT and fresh. Burgers were good, too. The size of the burgers are plenty enough to get one full and with endless fries- pretty good deal for your $. We were offered more fries before we had the chance to request, cool. One thing I may note is that I ordered a whole grain bun for my burger. It wasn't the same quality or freshness of the regular buns. It was a bit dry and crumbly.

Wet, nasty, dirty, sticky tables no matter which direction you looked.  It also appeared that a shift change may have been going on as we had more than one server. No one was rude, but the place was filthy and the service was inexcusable slow based on the fact that there appeared to be an employee for every table in use.

It also seems if we eat in the bar, you don't get the annoying upsell of expensive drinks and desserts, (with the bottomless fries, we never have room).

141,Katlynn H.,"Des Moines, WA",0,9,,1.0,2013-12-15,I love red robin in general but I absolutely detest this red robin location. let me tell you why: so my grandmother and I decide to eat here one Saturday afternoon and she and I both ordered our burgers and each of us took a couple of bites just too discover that both of our burgers were burned charcoal black! We asked the waiter if we could get a refund and if the cook can remake our burgers. So he comes back and offers half off our order but they wouldn't remake the burger! Are you kidding me???!!! You expect us to eat an inedible cheeseburger! So we asked to speak with the manager and he said the same thing but this time didn't charge us for the meal but charged us for our drinks and still wouldn't remake our burgers! We just walked right out and I later called corporate and complained and they sent me a $25 gift card. I will use that gift card at perhaps the tukwila or at the Bellevue location. Never again will I dine at this particular Red Robin location! You should only dine here if you enjoy eating burnt burgers and not getting another burger after you were served an inedible one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=140,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.148,3.3600000000000003

114,Shane Y.,"Seattle, WA",46,176,17.0,3.0,2014-01-14,Its better than McDonalds yet worse than any other sit down restaurant that serves a burger. The prices are on average $3 more than fast food and the ingredients taste like they could be used for fast food. The burgers need the red robin special salt to make them enjoyable. There are probably 100 better burger places within a 15 minute drive of this place.  The service is and always will be slower than acceptable. For whatever reason when this place is empty it takes longer to get your food than when its packed. If you call in an order for pick up and they say 10 minutes that really means 20 if not 30. Twice I have ordered pick up and the order didn't get put in until I walked in the door.  I have now officially sworn off Red Robin for the fore sable future.

A table was seated near us.  One of the members of their party was an autistic teenage girl.  The waitress was rude to her and her mother.  Telling them if they weren't ready to order then they'd just have to wait because she was busy.  The mom was fighting back tears.   Perhaps she didn't pick up on the signs.  But when I was paying my bill I pointed out to the waitress that the young lady was autistic and wasn't being rude.  She said "" I know.  Thanks.  The hostess already warned me.  But thanks for the heads up.""  It wasn't a ""heads up"".  I was politely giving her a ""mind your manners.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines?start=100,2.64,2.64,2.64,1.924,2.64

I remember eating there when they first opened, and it was wonderful.  That is NOT the case any longer.  We arrived at 7:40 pm - not exactly the dinner hour rush.  I requested a full, large booth, and we were told we'd have to wait for 10 minutes, although there was a full booth available.  During the wait we both went to the restroom.  The restrooms were filthy and looked like they could be hazardous from the lighting hanging from the ceiling, and the sides of the stalls propped up with wood blocks.  I'm assuming they are remodeling the restrooms, but this is the worst I think I've seen in the U.S.  Finally we were seated, and instead of the full booth we requested, the hostess sat us in a half booth with a small table.  Strike one.   It was 7 minutes before the server even made it to our table to say ""hello"".  We requested water (plus an extra glass for my husband), some fries to munch on while we were waiting for our meal, and a chocolate shake to come out before the meal.  It took a total of 20 minutes to get our water, and then the server only brought one glass for my husband.  No shake.  No fries.  No silverware.  Strike two.   When we finally got our meal, about 40 minutes after being seated, we still had no silverware and my husband had to request more water.  The waiter left quickly and didn't check back for quite awhile.  When he did check back to see how our dinner was, my husband had already finished his meal.  It was after that, that we finally received the chocolate shake.  Strike three.

100,Thomas S.,"Des Moines, WA",67,31,7.0,1.0,2015-11-18,"It's got to be really bad if I'd rather write this review than eat the food. This visit 11/17/2015 negates our 3 previous 4-5 star visits. It was that bad. It's not that it was unusually busy for a Tuesday night. That was taken into consideration during our long waits. So, this place is newly remodeled. That part is good. The service was terrible. And I mean terrible. One of the top 10 worst experiences ever. So, our server comes to our table relatively quickly. I order a coffee, my wife a white wine. Server comes back a few minutes later and informs that a fresh pot needs to be brewed, no problem there. Several minutes later, she returns with my coffee and the wine. Takes our order, and is gone. 30-40 minutes gone. Empty coffee cup, empty wine glass. No server in sight. So, 45 minutes post order, I use the handy-dandy call server button on the automated table doo-hicky. Flashing red beacon blinking. This might get us a refill, right, WRONG!!! Several servers and staff walked right by us. Finally 10 minutes after pushing the button, our server carries some drinks past our table, clearly looks at the light. So, we figure she'll serve the table she is headed to and check back with us... WRONG AGAIN!!! She checks the table next to us and bails. I push the blinking red beacon to the edge of the table with our empty cups. Several minutes still. And finally. But, my wife now wanted coffee instead of the stale tasting wine she had before. The server seemed annoyed at this. Fancy that, SHE was annoyed. She the says ""I'll go check on your food, I wonder what's taking so long"". Yeah, I wonder. So, here it comes. I wish I could post the picture to this review but, you'll have to see it up there. I substituted sweet potato fries. And, that's what I got. A tiny handful of old, dry sweet potato fries. At this point I am ready to walk out. After sitting for an hour, that's what I get. I really no longer had an appetite. I pushed my untouched plate to the side. The server apparently noticed a few minutes later and asked if everything was OK. A few minutes later a fresh basket of fries was brought to me. But, apparently what was taking so long was our food sitting, getting cold. Mine was a borderline acceptable temperature but, my wife's burger was cold. She waited to tell me until after we left, knowing, I was on the edge of talking to the manager. I was irritated enough to want to walk out before the food came. After the fries, I really didn't feel this place deserved my money. One simple note to the manager. If you have staff unaccustomed to working on a busy night, actually train a TEAM. The fact that all of your servers have tunnel-vision and will not at least give a ""thank you for waiting, I'll get your server"" gives you as a manager a big FAIL. So really, this is your failure. The waits, and food mishaps could have been heavily softened by some kind attentiveness by the staff. This is basic customer service. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

I cannot spend money at a place that treats their people that horribly.

If you guys want to know why there's so many new people in and out of that place I'm betting that's why right there. Restaurants need a good team and you can't form one doing that.

Then it goes sideways. 45 minutes for food is a long long time.  My fish was so over cooked, the batter actually cut the roof of my mouth. I had a half a cup of tartar sauce, not enough for all the fish, so I left over cooked fish uneaten. My salad was withered, scraps, nothing I would serve, nothing I would eat, but I couldn't eat it anyway.  My daughter had the corn dog bites. They were as dark brown as they could get without being black. I asked for ranch for her, she said she would bring it back. I gave my daughter my ranch from my salad, she never came back. (Why I couldn't eat my salad) My wife's burger bun was almost too crunchy to eat.  The waitress never ever came back to our table. Ever.  If I had to guess our good sat under the lights by the horrible waitress a long time, only a guess. Those darn computers allow them to not have to cone back to get your money. Well guess what, they won't get anymore of mine. We have had less than good experiences there before, but nothing like this. They are understaffed with unqualified employees and management that must be oblivious. It's deteriorated over time, we used to go every week. I noticed last night it's been two months. It will be a cold day in he'll before we go back.

After ordering it took about 40 minutes, if not longer, to get our food.  I was starving by then.  I finished my burger, fries, and water in less than 10 minutes.  We wanted more water, and refills on our fries and sweet potato fries, but out waitress had disappeared after taking our dinner order.  We were finally able to stop another waitress and ask if she can put in an order of sweet potato fries for us. Another long wait, at least 10 minutes, and no fries.  Another waitress came along and asked if we wanted more fries.  We told her we had put in an order already.  She came back with regular fries, and we asked if the sweet potato fries were coming, which we had ordered.  She said there were no sweet potato fries out, which I'm sure the other waitress had never put in the order for us. So we finally got our refills of the regular fries and sweet potato fries, but by this time, I'm highly irritated because we spent so much time here waiting.  And one of my pet peeves:  no refills on the water.  I hate eating with no water. Our actual waitress still had not come around since taking our order, and we were definitely ready for the check.  I couldn't even pay using the electronic pad sitting on the table because it had other people's orders mixed with mine.  Took some time again to find another waitress to give us our check.  I really really regret not getting Chinese food like we had originally intended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-des-moines,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.608,2.12

I came in on June 1st 2016 after moving to the area the exact day. I had a group of friends help me move my stuff and we came down here to grab dinner and relax. Relax i say? Yeah i tried doing that but i was sick for 3 days in a row & that was NOT MY IDEA OF RELAXING!  This location has a bunch of young girls working here but they were all pleasant with us. Because they don't actually ""Take your order"" you instead just order from the table tablet (Wee technology), so you really have little interaction with them except for the food being served. The wait time was somewhat long and i made a mental note that the location seemed dark and dull. Not as lively as i remember red robins to be. So when we finally got our food, I don't remember the sandwich i got but i do know it came with avocados and we did have some fries but that was all i ate. The food tasted great but half way eating it i did notice i wasn't feeling well so i took the rest of my sandwich to go. Afterwords all i could do was take pepto bismol and lay down for hours upon hours. Then the next day i had pains in my stomach and threw up on the 3rd day. At first i didn't think too much of my Red Robins meal because i was still in the process of unpacking but by the 3rd day i understood what it was.  So i am never going to this location again & if i had seen all the one stars on yelp before i went down here, i would of avoided this place like the plague. Please take my warning & stay away.

The only good thing about this place is they just updated the looks of it so now it's not crusty, more sports bar-y. But nonetheless it's still dirty... Sooo idk this restaurant looking nice is even a ""pro""  I used to go here for everything as a kid. After school concerts, birthday parties, family dinners. It was a place to get chicken tenders and play video games (which they no longer have btw) and I was a little kid. Didn't take much to please me then.  But now I HATE this place. The wait staff sucks so much, the food sucks even more, and I have had far too many ""this will never happen again"" moments here. Nuh uh this place deserves zero stars. The worst and last experience I've had here: my mom ordered take out for my family and I (just me, my husband, my mom, and my dad). I had just had a baby so I was hangry and tired and wanted a Groovy Smoothie from here cuz the couch was extremely comfortable at the time. Clucks & fries for my husband and I to split, a Groovy Smoothie, an order of fish n chips, and a bacon cheeseburger.  K she called it in and they said 20 minutes but we've ordered take out from them before and it's more like 45 min. So she went after a half hour and sure enough the food was not even ready. At all. She sat in the bar (that's also where you have to pick your food up) for a half hour before the dumbass brought her the food. She just took my moms debit card and handed the stuff and didn't say anything. She didn't have to sign anything which was weird and she asked the lady, ""is this all?"" and the stupid waitress told her yes. Note: my mom didn't check to make sure the order was right at this time. She was tired af of waiting and you really shouldn't have to check. But yeah. When she got home she was giving everyone their food but there were no clucks & fries :'( None. But guess what there was instead? A box with literally 4 fries in it. Four fries!! That was the dinner my husband and I were supposed to share LOL LOL LOL omg. Everyone else's food was correct. Except the smoothie I got was only filled halfway in one of their to go cups! And the to go ones are small as it is so I'm positive that's not how much you'd get if you sat down and ordered it. It's normally huge. But whatever.  She looked at her receipt and she was charged for TWO clucks & fries. But she received NONE! And she ordered only ONE! So wtf. She was pissed because she felt bad because it was food for me.. She went back and they gave her an order of clucks & fries but she had paid for two and brought in the receipt and everything. I'm sure she was screaming at them by then because they're so. fucking. stupid. here. I can't say it enough.  But some guy who was the manager came to talk to her and gave her a $10 gift card... Hahahahah like no. She took it and I'm assuming stormed outta there.  Bitch, please. That $10 RR gift card has been sitting on the desk and will probably get thrown away. We're never going back here.  *****this is just one horrible experience but there have been too many to even write about. Like the time when another table was given our order from someone random in the kitchen who brought it out and then after it was put in front of those people it was given to us. EW EW EW stop.

2,Kelly M.,"Renton, WA",10,36,4.0,2.0,2016-10-04,"So here's the deal, for the last year or so I've come here about twice to three times per week for lunch.  I was a regular.  My service was always good, food was usually good--I mean it's Red Robins, it's what I'd expect.  Plus they always knew me and knew I didn't want to sit at the bar and I like Root Beer floats.  Until lately. Then within the last few weeks, they went thru a rotation of employees and the young friendly staff at the hostess stand was replaced by a older lady who hates her job.  And I mean this woman really hates her job.  Every time I came in, she'd invite me to the bar and I would tell her I don't want to sit in the bar, I want the dining room.  Then (every time) she'd scoff at me for taking her valuable time and seat me at a table.  It got to a point that I felt like I was going to the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld.  Now I don't feel I should have to explain myself, but the reason I don't sit in the bar area is because I am wearing my company logo and I don't want people to be telling my boss I was drinking during lunch; secondly, I don't like high tables--if I do something stupid, it is a much farther fall to the floor from a high top table than a booth. But my last visit was the last straw.  I came in on 10/3/16 at or about noon.  The place was practically empty.  There was no hostess, standing up front, hating life, so I figured I'd just sit at the bar so I wouldn't have to waste the her time.  I sat for about 10 mins while the female bar tender was on the phone.  When she saw me, she came over 5 mins later, I got my float and then I ordered a bowl of soup and sweet potato fries (simple stuff right?  After all it's note even busy).  She left me for 20 mins and my bottomless float was no longer bottomless.  So for fear of running late back to the job, I had to skip my lunch, and leave.  I did offer to pay for the float and they said don't worry about it.  So at least my not-so-bottomless float was free.

The food is decent (pretty good when you want something heavy) so don't expect the place to have 4.5 stars+ on Yelp. I sat at the bar during dinner time because it was pretty busy in the main dining room. Got the menu and then it took a pretty long time for the bartender to get back to us to take our menu. She was off on her own in the beginning and didn't return to the bar for a while. We weren't in a rush though, but it was longer than I would have wanted to order food. I always get the short stack of onion rings here ($5 appetizer menu). It comes with six onion rings and the campfire and ranch sauce for dipping. Out of all the locations, I think this place did not do a good job in making the onion rings. The fried batter was just falling off the ring, and it was falling apart completely. It was never like this at other locations. I enjoy the tavern menu here because the burgers are smaller than the regular burger menu. Because the fries are bottomless (aka unlimited), I don't need a huge burger to fill me up. In fact, the tavern leaves me feeling pretty full by the end of it. If you like the tavern, you can make them bigger for an additional charge. They come up with different style taverns, and I tried the taco one. It comes with guacamole, salsa, and tortilla strips inside. I didn't taste the strips (I wonder if they turned into mush from all the sauces inside?). The guacamole was good, but I wish there was more. The salsa wasn't very potent, just subtle. Fries came out crisp and I dipped mine in honey poppy (the good stuff!). The bartender came back toward the latter half of dinner and was very attentive from then on. She filled our water, asked us if we needed anything several times throughout our dinner and was available if we needed her.  Checking out is simple now that they use the little electronic pads at each table. You can split the bill easily as well and then head on out as soon as your done! No more flagging down a waiter and waiting for your check, hurray! Overall, food was pretty good and service was decent. I still come back for the endless fries time after time.
