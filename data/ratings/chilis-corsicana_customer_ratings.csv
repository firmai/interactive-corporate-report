9,Sara C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,3,,1.0,2012-02-24,"Worst restaurant experience in years.  Nice people, no idea how to run a restaurant.  Food subpar for Chilies.  They forgot appetizer, never offered refills. Burger, potatoes were lukewarm at best.  Even chicken fingers looked pitiful.  Bathroom changing table blocked access to sink,  really!?  If passing through avoid this, and hold out for something closer to civilization.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000004

Almost 1-1/2 hours later we were still waiting for our food. When the food did arrive it was warm, and much of it wrong.

I would have expected them to come and explain this before serving the incomplete dish. Then ordered some fajitas which came and were pretty much raw. Had them returned to get them we'll done.

5,Crystal M.,"Katy, TX",1,1,,1.0,2014-07-05,"The service was beyond terrible. We got our food at the same time as our appetizer. When we ask to return the appetizer and not pay for it the server would argue and just walked off leaving our food on the tray not even serving us. We talked to one of the managers and she was just pretending to listen. Our server ignored us the rest of our time there and accused my father of cursing at her when he told her to take the appetizer back, which was a lie. She argued again claiming that he cursed then walked away throwing her hands up. All we wanted was an apology for her behavior and she couldn't even give us that. Horrible service. Never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001

10,Tabbey E.,"Dawson, TX",0,6,,1.0,2014-12-26,"I'm all about the service! The male host was lazy,rude and partial to certain parties! And they were not Families with small children. By passed us and another couple with a small child.he was leaning on the podium when I came in and looked at me without saying a word, like what the hell do you want! Had words with him several times had to get the Manager involved. Although she tried to be accommodating by giving us a free appetizer, the damage was done. Our waitress Jean was also very accommodating . Left her a nice tip.We live near Corsicana and have only been to this Chilis a handful of times because the service is always terrible in one form or another. The food is so so. They get one star from me. I personally will not be returning . Would not have went this trip , but received gift cards for Christmas. What a waste of my Families hard earned money. I'm not in a habit of paying people to be rude to me. My advice , steer clear of this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20,,,,,
4,Mike F.,"Corsicana, TX",9,64,13.0,1.0,2015-01-09,"Food was alright, but my major problem i have with them is that the beer there is probably the ""warmest beer in navarro county"" i love draft beers, but i just wont ever order a beer there again due to the beer temperature. And this isn't the first time. They have good margaritas but DONT order a draft beer unless you don't like them cold. I will have to say that a new restaurant in town under the bridge is probably the coldest in town. It had ice in it. Me and my wife's favorite food is the texas cheese fries",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana?start=20,,,,,

Visit was just what it should be: prompt greeting, friendly service, tasty food. Tried the new Top Shelf tacos with pork and enjoyed them. Hubbie liked the enchiladas he ordered. Am torn about the new table-top tablets with games, menu, ordering, and check-out functions. On the one hand, it's another excuse for people not to talk to each other over a meal. On the other hand, waiting too long for a check after a meal is a pet peeve and the new gadgets eliminate that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana,,,,,

There were ants crawling all over the tabl, which the mananger crushed with her fingers, then asked if I'd like a drink.  As a server..I witnessed someone take a DIRTY plate from the dish pit and give it to a cook, then SERVE SOMEONE FOOD ON A DIRTY PLATE.  I SAW SERVERS PICK THEIR NOSES, SCRATCH THEIR ARMPITS & NEVER WASH THEIR HANDS.NOT ONCE.  This place is dirty and breaks numerous health code violations left & right.

17,Angel T.,"Longview, TX",70,57,9.0,1.0,2016-01-26,"Wow is all I can say about this chilis.  I do not recommend coming to this location.  We came with a party of 6 to celebrate a birthday and are now leaving after paying for food that was inedible, just to go to mcdonalds to feed everyone.  The appetizers that came AFTER we got our food were so old and cold that after being sent back twice, we just had to give up.  The manager did nothing to remedy any of it even after seeing the food.   I can't even believe food can be sent out that way from such an established restaurant.  The guacamole that came with the fajitas was brown.  The fajitas were old and inedible.  The queso was completely burnt.. TWICE!!  The triple dipper looked like it had sat out for hours (which was the entree for the birthday boy), and was completely inedible.  The cheese fries that came after our food had jalapeños that were so old, the manager even said that shouldn't have come out that way.  The margarita chicken was cold in the middle and again, was completely inedible.   Out of 6 dinners, 3 were eaten.  Out of 3 appetizers, only 1 was eaten.   And again, the manager did not even care to listen.  He simply walked off while I was talking and said he would take the appetizers off the bill. Fellow yelpers, I always tend to give a restaurant a chance for a couple bad reviews because sometimes it's just a bad experience, but this is not just a bad experience, this restaurant needs a serious health inspection and NOW!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana,,,,,

Today, however, we sit down and wait...finally our drink order and appetizer order is taken. Took considerable time to get here...oh, no napkins or flatware on the table. In fact, my husband had to go to the bar and get the napkins and flatware. When the appetizer got here, chips and salsa, the chips were fried in lumps. Waiter did not check for drink refills...had to ask. Like I said, up till today we have never had a complaint to make but our waiter basically is very bad. Oh...and we have been here long enough for two servings of chips and still waiting for food. The waiter has yet to come back by. We won't give up on this location yet but this kind of service is what causes a normally good business to lose faithful customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana,,,,,
26,Amanda K.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,3.0,2016-05-22,"We were taken to our table right away, and our server appeared immediately. Ordered our food and drinks, which came in about 5 to 10 minutes. The server was always checking on us about every 2 minutes. Kind of hard to eat when you're having to talk. The food was also a much smaller portion than what was pictured, and the salmon was a little rubbery. The manager did come out and publicly humiliate a new server, because he did not put the salt bottle to the right, and the sugar in the tub was in the incorrect order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-corsicana,,,,,
