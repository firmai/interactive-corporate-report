126,Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",613,1079,2515.0,3.0,2012-01-05,"TGIF is a standard chain restaurant.  We've all been there.  We all love it and we all hate it.  Here are some of my reasons: Love: The Jack Daniels Burger.  Oh My.  The sauce on this burger is amazing.  It's sweet and smooth and taste so good on not only the burger but the sweet potato fries. Love: The Service.  It's usually pretty good.  Waiters rock red and white striped shirts and are generally friendly and energetic. Hate: The Sound.  It. Is. Soooooooo. Loud. In. There.  Why?  Because the designer of this particular location decided it would be a good idea to put tile on the floor, and tin on the ceiling.  Sound bounces around the place like crazy.   Go.  Eat.  But if you're looking to have a real conversation request to sit in one of the side dining rooms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

134,Mike M.,"Kirkland, WA",36,49,2.0,1.0,2012-07-14,"Don't come here.   The service is pretty horrendous.  It took thirty minutes to get water, forty minutes to get two salads.  Ridiculous. I'm pretty sympathetic when it comes to restaurants and the wait staff, as we all know they deal with some of the most unruly of patrons.  But that is not excuse for the attitude that I received right upon sitting down. The waitress I had was extremely rude; and seemed entirely bothered by my presence.  She was far more interested in her friends that sat in a booth near our table. We were largely ignored, not given any courteous service, and had to wait ridiculously long for everything - EVEN WATER.  Now, I realize the 'kitchen' gets packed, but WATER is ALL THE WAITRESS.  The food came out late and cold, so it was pretty clear that this woman wasn't doing her job. Positives: - Nothing.  Food probably would've been good, had it not cooled on a damn window sill while our waitress passed pleasantries with her loud and annoying pack of morons. Negatives: - Gets extremely packed, so be prepared to wait for your seat for an extremely long time. - Horrible service.  This absolute WORST I've ever had to deal with in my life. - Prices for drinks are pretty horrendous. The space Yelp allows me does not give me enough to express how displeased I am with this place.  I will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

There wasn't too many people there a the time (around 6ish) and we sat in the bar. It was a nice TGIF; clean, cool, with crimson walls and booths, and with less crap on the wall compared to other TGIFs.  The bar was a big square and we all fit in to sides of the bar that formed a right angle. It was a good seating arrangement since we could all see each other and talk to each other without craning our necks. My bf and I took advantage of their Happy Hour deals: Half priced appetizers and $2 to $5 on select drink specials (ask the bartender which drinks are included in the happy hour special).

Wrong! Tasteless, with solid cheese inside, couldn't even melt the cheese!   Arguably, these items are not hard to do well, however, everything tasted as if it was taken directly from the freezer, and thrown into a fryer without a care as to its preparation.

The hostess told us the wait would be 20 minutes which for how busy it was didn't seem that bad. About 15 minutes later another party of 4 walked through the door and I went to follow to see how long their wait time would be. But, they didn't have one. They were seated right away, and when I asked when we were to be seated she said another 10 minutes. She told every single group of people that their wait time would be 20 minutes. It was vague and poorly handled and she was rude. They didn't have a proper system and no pagers were given. Finally when we were brought to our table I saw at least 6 empty tables on the way to ours. Empty tables on a Saturday night with at least 10 parties waiting to be seated? Bad move. At least 3 of those tables were dirty during our entirety in the restaurant. We ordered quickly since we waited so long (at least half an hour) and waited again. Drinks took at least 10 minutes to hit the table. 2 of us ordered Margaritas which were surprisingly good. One ordered a 22oz angry orchard, which he enjoyed, and then my fiancé ordered coffee. But, of course, not before getting mocked by our douchey waiter! I bet making jokes at your customers expense will help you pocket a solid tip, buddy.  Food was pretty good and it came our relatively quick. We ordered two 3 for alls and two of the new sharing appetizers. Nothing to write home about but we were satisfied. New bacon mac and cheese balls were really good and I liked the pretzels with beer cheese.  But, yet again service was crap. Our waiter did not bring our food out. So we were separating dishes and the waitress got pissed she had to hold the plate for more than a second and put them down on the table and told us ""to figure it out ourselves.""

My friend and I got cokes and split the three for all appetizer plate. We had traditional buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks, and potstickers. The wings were good but not terribly meaty. The sticks were very tasty and not greasy. The potstickers were particularly good. There was a sauce provided for each part of the meal. My only complaint is that all the sauces blended on the small serving plates we were given, which gave some weird flavor combinations.

We had a huge round table to ourselves with a full view of the TVs situated at the bar. Our waitress took forever to get our drink orders and then even longer to get our food order.

Several of their options are calorie-friendly and come in at under 600 cals. This is better than places like Applebee's, which only offer a handful of items under 1,000 cals. I went with the chicken and shrimp. The chicken was good and tender, the shrimp was full of flavor, and the sauce on the side was actually pretty good. Overall, it's a quick and decent place if you're in the land of chain restaurants (this area close to Roosevelt Field only seems to have chains) and you're hungry.

It was so bad my daughter had to watch everybody eat while waiting on them to make her entree from the beginning. Not to mention all the different sides that came to the table that we had to send back. He did try to make it up and bring her some fries. Which was nice, but....... When her food finally came and she asked for some condiments, they took FOREVER to come. Like really!!!!! My daughter took it upon herself to ask the hostess for a manager. No management came. We had a ToGo order that we gave to the server at the beginning of our entree orders and specifically let him know it was a ToGo order. When we were asking for the ToGo boxes and ready to leave, my husband inquired about the ToGo meal and the server went to put it in. LIKE REALLY!!!!

I had to be healthy so I ordered the harvest salad without chicken because I'm a vegetarian and a side of spinach.  Our waitress was very nice but I asked for the spinach about 3 times before it actually did come out. I was disappointed in the spinach. It tasted okay but it was drenched in oil and served with Parmesan cheese on top of it with mushrooms and onions. Maybe they could have made it a little healthier before they killed the nutritional value of all the veggies.  The salad was pretty small.

We are stripes members and ordered chips and salsa and it never came. The waiter never acknowledged this. Finally 30 mins later out food finally came. The waiter never came to check up on us and my fiancé had to leave our table and go to another table to grab a ketchup bottle. We asked for then check which took another 10 mins to show up. We were waiting for our check to be picked up and 15 mins later the waiter still hadn't come back to our table. Frustrated we took back our credit card and instead left cash for the bill.

We were sat at a table that was filled with crumbs and floor was sticky, since it was a cramped corner for our party of 9, we described the problems and asked to be moved.  We were moved. I cannot even get involved with how many complaints I have about this visit because there are too many, but I will just tell you the main parts. Our side of fries was forgotten and my sister finished all of her food before they finally brought the fries out when we reminded them that they forgot.  My meat was very pink and I ordered well done. The two coronas that my mother ordered with the waiter, were never brought to us. We had to go to the bar to retrieve the drinks ourselves (two separate times!)   Then when I went to use the restroom, there were 3 stalls. 1 of them did not lock, 1 did not have toilet paper and the final stall had feces literally spread all over the seat and piled inside the bowl. I am immediately went and found somebody to address the issue, I apologized for being the bearer of bad news and the hostess said to me "" it's OK, this happens on a weekly basis and I'm sure it's not nearly as bad as last week when I had to clean it"". Then I saw a female employee come from the bathroom removing her dirty gloves As she passed a bunch of tables WITH PEOPLE EATING.  I wish I took a picture of the table with crumbs and the sticky floor but I didn't know it would be the least of my problems. But I do have an image of the toilet.

Let me explain my experience, walk in to an empty restaurant and was told I had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table, it took the waitress another 20 minutes to come to the table at which time we asked for water that never came. We eventually got the attention of a girl wiping down tables and asked her for water . We did finally get water 25 minutes later. Our waitress finally came with a horrible attitude, the plates from the appetizers were never cleared and our main dish was served leaving very little room on the table. The waitress never smiled the few times  we did see her which wasn't very often. I work in a profession that requires my staff to uphold values of providing excellent customer service.

Hey Monday is Great time to go to Friday's. I need a cold Beer! I chose to sit at the bar today, I like sitting at the bar because service is usually pretty quick.  That is not the case here at this Friday's on my 4th visit here. I still was not immediately acknowledged at the bar, in fact a good 10 minutes passed as the barmaids did not even contact my eyes.  I noticed immediately that the service staff seemed overwhelmed with the volume of customers tonight. I had not been greeted yet and decided I would help myself to a menu. This seems to be a disconnect here between the staff and the patrons. After another 10 minutes no one had acknowledged me yet, I decided it was time to clean off the bar in front of me, to wipe away the crumbs. The barmaid was straightening and maintaining the bar in front of me, I finally had to said  ""Hello"" myself.  Looked up  I noticed half of the TVs surrounding the bar were  Turned off and or Broken?!!   Come on guys ?? This is Monday night football!  I was just in another  bar with over 100 big screen televisions. This is Totally inexcusable and unacceptable for Monday night football.  Or ""Any"" Bar, that would be open.  I asked about Monday night football specials, there either were not any, or the barmaid did not know.  In a saving grace they did have $5 Octoberfest On tap.. The  Barmaid did not even know what kind?!   There were not any runners bringing the food out with the exception of the poor overworked manager.  As a result some of the food was coming out cold as the barmaids themselves had to go down and get the food from the kitchen.  My spare rib dinner was not bubbling hot and my fries were ice cold.  My barmaid was kind enough to bring me another order of fries but with no food runners these also were not piping hot.  The manager and barmaid tried as best as they could,  but they are totally Understaffed here. A decision corporate makes to save money at the expense of the customers.  I hate giving any place A 2  Star rating,  but how can you even open your bar with most of your televisions broken.  There are literally a 100 eating establishments in a 5-mile mile radius in this Westbury and Garden City area, offering incredible, fabulous Dining experiences.

Asked him once again for the container, he said ""I'll take care of it.""  Came back with a container (no bag to put it in), and one more round of the endless appetizer, but had it placed slightly off the table, that one misplaced hand gesture sends it to the floor...

74,Michael G.,"Glen Oaks, Queens, NY",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-29,SUCKS!!! Wish I could give negative stars.  Miserable individuals working there. Not one smile in the place.  Was seated for 20 minutes without one person asking if we'd like a drink. Place is crap. Should turn it into an Applebee's!! We walked out and went down the road to Houlihan's where they greeted us with a smile and served right away. The way service is supposed to be.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury,1.92,2.17,2.17,,2.0700000000000003
67,Seta M.,"Hempstead, NY",11,59,16.0,1.0,2017-12-30,"After my complaint here and on their website, I received a call from their General Manager. The details are below. Still waiting for them to take care of their end. I will keep U posted: ""This is a follow up to my initial complaint regarding events that took place on this day. After filing my first complaint regarding your server giving me a beef patty after my wife and I specifically advised we were vegetarian and wanted a well done black bean burger (which we had at your establishment before), I received a call from someone identifying herself as the General Manager. I gave her details about the incident and included something I did not write after my first contact, that the waitress gave us tortilla chips that had half eaten chicken in them. Now this might be heresay, however I took a picture of the item and it now resides on yelp.  The General Manager listened to this and apologized profusely and said she was going to send me a gift card to make up for it. I advised her that it should be sent to my wife and that we would come during the day because I really didn't want to see that server again because I am allergic to beef and didn't want her serving us. She verified my email address and since then, I have heard nothing.  This is not good follow up, especially since this was an incident that could have devolved into a legal battle. This feels like exact what I mentioned to the General Manager: Lack of attention to detail. Except this lack of detail is now coming directly from her.  I want to make you aware of this before I decide how I will respond to this situation. I want to be clear: as I stressed to her, I am VERY upset about this and feel something should be done. It is my hope that you feel the same way.  Thank you. """,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury,1.92,2.15,2.15,,2.0580000000000003

I rated 3 stars bc it took what seemed like almost more than half an hour to get our food and when we Finally got our food, it was disgustingly cold. They were short staff. Waitress  was good.  Floors needed to be cleaned. The place ran out of popular appetizers- granted it was a holiday season. I'd still go here again - Bc It's Friday's !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury,2.0,2.15,2.15,,2.0900000000000003
