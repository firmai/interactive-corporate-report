Martinus I.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,18,,2.0,12/2/2017,"Well, we went today and it was very crowded. We had to wait but that was all right since our party was not all there yet. We were seated and we waited for our waitress came. Our waitress was Hunter, and we know here. She's a great waitress and she took our orders with no problems at all.  I told you it was busy so we had to wait a bit until our order was done. I and another member of our group ordered a double tavern burger with all the trimmings on it. The other person just ordered appetizers because he wasn't that hungry.  My burger came with a dismal piece of tomato, NO onions and what seemed to be a piece of wilted lettuce. My friend's burger came with only a piece of lettuce and nothing else. The appetizers of my friend we're not that great either. He ordered Battered Mushrooms and when they came they looked like little pieces of dough dumped in batter. THEY WERE SLICES OF MUSHROOM DUMPED IN BATTER AND DEEP FRIED! REALLY? We complained to the manager and he gave us new burgers and an extra order of zucchini sticks. Also he cut the bill in half which was very nice, but we heard from more tables that their orders were not correct. It seems that the kitchen is not really working good when it is very busy in the restaurant. They need to work on that. I am used to see better food at Red Robin, so this is definitely a point of improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield
Melissa S.,"Milwaukee, WI",29,202,879,1.0,4/3/2016,"So I am so disappointed with the remodel of this location I have to downgrade it to 1 star. The designers did a horrible job with the layout. Seats are almost touching or with very little space between tables. I could barely get into the bench seat against the wall in the bar area. I can hear every word of people sitting next to me. No privacy and even worse the tables in bar area are high tops with the smallest top ever. Barely enough room for 2 plates and drinks - each table has those ziosk things you use to pay or order and they take up a huge space now. Center of table is filled with 2 spices ketchup and drink menu which takes up even more room. What if I want an appetizer and a glass of water plus a cocktail?  Where am I going to out all that???? Very bad design overall. When I went to restrooms the whole corridor was filled with extra chairs apparently removed from the main floor to make more room. Clearly there is a problem. Poor lady in wheelchair was waiting for table and I have no idea how they were going to get her to a spot safely.  The food is the same but the ambience is ruined. I will wait to go back for awhile to see if they fix it. If not, I'll have to seriously consider giving up one of my favorite chains to eat at.  Please corporate or local manager at Red Robin - do something quickly before this location loses more business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield
Dejuante W.,"Milwaukee, WI",57,14,68,4.0,5/20/2017,I didn't think the place was going to be as good. I was blown away with how good and tasty the turkey burger was.

Donna C.,"Lafayette, CO",29,239,25,3.0,7/26/2016,"With small and mid-aged kids, Red Robin is always reliable. Adults can find something too. Gourmet burgers is stretching it a bit. This location is ok, on par with others I've been to.  Service: Waitress was friendly, attentive and helpful.  Food: eh, ok.  Ambience/cleanliness: Leaves something to be desired. We went for late lunch on a Saturday and the place was trashed. Felt like no one cleaned up after the lunch rush. Women's bathroom was a mess.  Probably other choices right there by the mall.

Kelly B.,"Milwaukee, WI",280,530,529,4.0,3/21/2016,"I had a surprisingly awesome lunch today at Red Robin; I had never been before and pictured it to be a lot like the chili's. It was a little more updated and cool than I thought, and I dig when they have the pay at the table option on the tablet - makes work lunches a nice quick in-and-out.  They offer their meat patties as well as either a Boca burger or a Gardenburger for no extra charge. There are options of either steak fries, sweet potato fries which are bottomless with any entree. For upcharges you can also get garlic fries or other delicious options.  I got a Gardenburger with onion straws, steak sauce, blue cheese lettuce and tomato. The burger was great, the toppings were so flavorful and the fries were hot and fresh. Our server was prompt and our drinks were always filled. The pop glasses are actually really big too so it cuts down on refills :) It's near work and super convenient, which helps too :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield

We got to the restaurant at 7:10 pm. After 14 minutes of waiting for our server to come to the table we hit the ""call server"" button. Within a couple more min someone came by and said she was sorry, our server was tied up and could she grab our drink order. We ordered drinks and 10 min later our server finally showed up with two small plates (she apologized that they were out of baskets) of fries, without the ranch dressing we had asked for! She again asked us if she could take our drink order (she just brought our drinks!) We placed our order and she once again apologized for everything taking so long. All the while the manager was walking in circles around the restaurant! I tried to get eye contact with him but he never looked at us!!  Our food showed up and of course my husbands burger didn't have the BBQ sauce that it was suppose to come with!!  Horrible service, fries were soggy, hamburger bun was soggy, just an overall bad experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield

While the company was good, the food and service was lacking. I had the turkey burger which I think should have been accurately described as a 'turkey patty' since it was ground and compressed into a pile of grey matter (not ground turkey).  AVOID.

Steven G.,"Chicago, IL",146,246,2,3.0,7/18/2016,"The staff at this joint are quick and friendly. I do like the implementation of the Ziosks, which allows you to order and pay instantly, without having to haggle with the server. The dishes have become less plentiful over time, and the quantity of fries they provide is so minuscule you certainly will have to ask for more.

Now they have upscale the burgers. Quite tasty!  And as a bonus they were one of the first (and one of the few now) to offer lettuce wrapped burgeees for the lo carb folk. So no knife and fork or knife  needed (like George in Seinfeld eating a snickers).  Bonus: lots of adult beverages to choose from. Some wacky for me (beer and ice cream is something I pass on) but lots of brews, spirit and the like.  So, red robin...yum",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield
Kasey K.,"Brookfield, WI",0,27,3,2.0,11/15/2016,"I've eaten here before and it was decent; pricey but decent.   So my wife had a hungry moment for a burger, so we said sure let's go.  First impression, this will be interesting. The seater looks like she is high on something (not life) and simply looks at us, ""how many"" she finally mumbles. She then disappears and seats the people ahead of us, ok but then another seater comes along and takers the group that came after us.  Ok interesting.  Well we finally get seated and I must say waited on rather quickly. Our orders are in and we received our drinks, life is looking up. Except everyone around us is getting their food, even the people who came after us. Interesting again right. I guess our freshly butchered cow took a little longer to go down then everyone else's. Finally we got our food and it was ok, didn't look like the pictures but it was ok.  My wife's and my burger were good, my sons meatballs on sticks were decent, sad looking but decent. However my daughter's past looked like left over noodles microwaved with the last of the sauce drizzled on the top of it with some form a weird parmasen cheese sparsely put on the top.  We ate, drank (with the slow refills, first off I'm getting my money worth by how many drinks I can put down), and the kind of sort bottomless fries must of found the bottom with 1 refill split between 4 people.  Now any placer that gives you Lawry's season salt should know that their fries are going in my belly faster than mini Me.  Instead of seeing how everything was the waitress came over and set us up to inn the damn table tablet and looked bothered that we asked for more fries.  Fry me damnit so I feel like I got my money worth.  One look of disgust was enough so we left after that. It would of been better with a little better service and some smiles. You are in the business of service, whatever happened to service with a smile. If you don't like your job stop, but you're getting paid so just pretend damnit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield
Damon R.,"Milwaukee, WI",38,295,594,3.0,7/27/2015,"I have never been much of a burger person. I do enjoy a good turkey burger.This is what i have always ordered when i went to Red Robin. The burgers were average. The bottomless fries are cool they are better will the fry salt of them. I like my fries a tad bit more crispy out and inside. I enjoy the apps more than the burgers. They have some of the best onion rings and cheese sticks. They are to die for, believe me. They have large servings and other things such as salads and entrees that aren't burgers. So you can have your pick.  The restaurant is set up like a old school diner with modern upgrades. Pretty nice ! The kids menu is awesome. They can get a little backed up on the weekend. The issue is they are in a hot bed of restaurant on the south side. If i want a burger and im  in south ridge without a doubt ill grab a grilled chicken sandwich from Kopps or a turkey burger from Ruby Tuesday. Red Robin is a good addition to the choices of places to eat from southridge. I have no complaints. Im more a local home grown type of guy who wants to support that. Versus the chain eateries that move in my area. I will go back to Red Robin in the future.  Dont let the 3 stars fool you. Its a great place to dine.

Aimee T.,"Sussex, WI",61,211,54,4.0,2/7/2016,Let's face it. You are not really going here for gourmet burgers.  It's a place kids love with lots of options and endless fries.  Expect screaming babies and loud kids.  If you expect anything else you will be really upset.  That being said the food is still a huge step up from a Culver's or a McDonald's.  It's more expensive too.  We have tried many things on the menu and I've never had anything that has been horrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield

Denise M.,"Milwaukee, WI",28,27,45,2.0,9/23/2015,"Ok, I usually like Red Robin, but last night's meal didn't really cut it.  I am loving that they embrace low-carb options like lettuce wrapped burgers (and they do it well so you can hold it like a regular burger to eat it) and they offer a ""skinny"" vodka strawberry lemonade drink, however, the quality and taste were lacking.  First the drink.  It was $7.03 for the skinny strawberry lemonade and vodka.  It didn't have any flavor and I can tell when there's vodka in my drink and this was waaaay light.  A $7 drink better be good but this didn't even hit the mark.  No sweetness or lemon flavor and no vodka flavor ... It tasted like strawberries in water actually.  Second, I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and lettuce-wrapped mushroom Swiss burger.  It came on a rectangle shaped plate with a little square ""cup"" of soup that spilled out onto the burger wrap.  The soup was the best part of the meal, just wish it had been a real cup ... Felt short and cheated a bit.  The burger lacked a sauce like mayo or something.  It consisted of a burger, a piece of cheese and just dried sautéed mushrooms that were falling all over.  I've had this there before and it was awesome so I know it was different.  Usually there's a mushroomy gravy and mayo ... Not last night. Hopefully this isn't a sign of quality changes there.  For price and quality of last night's meal I have to rate my visit there a two-star event.  Will consider a revision of I have a better experience the next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield

Dhaval V.,"Pewaukee, WI",6,54,50,3.0,1/3/2014,"I have eaten at this Red Robin a number of times before.  It is almost always crowded.  I guess being in a mall has its advantages.  It attracts a wide variety of patrons - families with kids; friends eating out together; older folks and just folks tired from being at the mall and eating at the first available joint. Food is your typical burger and sandwich fare.  There are a large number of options and so everyone will find something that suits their palette.  My personal favorite is the Burnin' Love burger with jalapeño slices in it.  It is consistently good but I can't say its spectacular. Overall, a decent place to eat.  But don't expect anything fancy - it's not meant to be that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=20
Andrew G.,"Germantown, WI",25,62,35,5.0,11/25/2015,I really enjoy their bottomless steak fries as well as their bottomless shakes the last few times I went to Red Robin.

The waiting time for a seat was exceptional and their staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.

Maria B.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,22,,5.0,11/15/2015,"Stopped in last night after doing some shopping at the mall.   The place was PACKED!   The wait was about an hour.   Kind of a long wait for a burger joint, but we didn't feel like going elsewhere and finding out the wait was just as long.   Not everyone was being as patient, as we heard one group complain to the Manager that they were about 5 minutes longer than their quoted time, but he seated them quickly after that.   We were seated near this family, unfortunately.    The service was fantastic, the food was good as it usually is at Red Robin, they are always very consistent.   The only thing that detracted from our experience was the guest that complained about EVERYTHING.   I saw our server struggle to take their order as they basically disregarded the menu and made up their own menu, which took about 5 minutes.   Then, once the food arrived, they complained about it very loudly to the manager, who was clearly exasperated with them.   They complained about the ladies room being dirty (I went in, it wasn't).   Basically, they couldn't be pleased.   I even heard them talk about how excited they were to send in a bad review. So I'm writing this review because despite dealing with these difficult customers, our server was fantastic!   She kept a positive attitude with us, despite our neighbors.   Our burgers were fantastic, and served quickly.   The Manager stopped by and chatted briefly, and was very professional.  He even personally delivered more fries to us!  Yes, the wait was a bit long, but it was a Saturday night at the Mall, so it's to be expected.    Great job, Red Robin!   Keep your chin up, some people are just difficult to please!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=20
Jon C.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,2,,1.0,6/17/2016,"Usually love Red Robin and have had nothing but good experiences at other locations. This location was the exception. Started out ordering a blue moon and getting a Stella. Not a huge deal I don't mind Stella so I just went with it. Ordered one of the new burgers(something with tortilla chips on it). Got the $2 upgrade for what I was told was a ""larger"" quantity of meat. The sandwich came and the patty was about the same thickness as the fries. Would have hated to see the amount of meat the normal sandwich came with. And the normal sandwich had 2 patties. Must have been paper thin. Then my wife commented on the consistency of the bacon on her chicken sandwich. After trying it i couldn't help but notice it was pre cooked bacon you would get in a box at the grocery store. It was paper thin rubbery with next to no flavor. And lastly my wife ordered a Mai tai and it had no flavor of alcohol. She is a light weight when it comes to drinking (1 glass of wine and she is sleeping) and she felt nothing after this large drink.

Colin A.,"Milwaukee, WI",118,320,113,3.0,7/9/2013,"For Milwaukeeans, there will always be better choices for grilled meat sandwiches (aka ""burgers"") than Red Robin: Sobelman's, AJ Bombers, Oscar's...you get the point. But when you're trapped in suburbia and want a burger to sate your hunger, you could also do much worse. As a chain, Red Robin has their schtick (bottomless fries, the ""Yummmm"" commercials that might drive you bonkers), and the menu rarely changes, but the service is spot-on and even if you only dine here once a year, there are enough choices for carnivores and veg-heads alike. Flavor is good, lots of ""Red Robin exclusives"" (Whiskey River BBQ, chili cheese). I tried the chili cheese burger during my last visit -- great flavor, but holy salt lake city! The sodium content was out of this state salty. Whew. The burger wasn't as sloppy as advertised, but that was OK, too. The bottomless fries are nice if you have a huge appetite, but I prefer mine to be a bit crispier. I tend to eat at Red Robin establishments when traveling for work conferences with a large group of people. Not my preference, but this is a place that can please a large group of folks and do so in a hurry. Parking is crazy here unless it's late in the evening, and the place is host to a zoo of people -- birthday parties are a big draw here -- but unless you've been shopping all day in Brookfield this probably is not your preferred location anyway. Oscar's & Sobelman's -- among others -- will always be my first choice for burgers in the 414, but again you can do much worse than the chain that is Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=20

Its reasonably priced at $5 for as many refills as I can drink. Sadly 2 but I was very satisfied nonetheless. My cousin had a burger with a mint brownie shake that she downed with no problem. Except her burger that only half was eaten. It wasn't as good as the shake (according to her as I looked at the licked clean drink). But then again she had no idea how to fit the burger in her mouth... it was huge! Appetizer: spinach dip....creamy cheesy goodness...with spinach. Our meals came also with bottomless steak fries. I don't know anyone who eats more than three servings or fries but hey...its a good deal Red Robin! Our single portion was enough.Totally going back again. And I'll be thinking of the Purple Lemonade for days until my next visit, craving that purple lemonade!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=20
Terra M.,"Riverside, CA",1,32,4,2.0,8/5/2014,"Burger was way over salted, and I love salt. Service sucked! We went on a Tuesday at 2:00 PM!!! No excuse to mess things up at that hour. Waitress screwed up our daughter's kids meal, left us waiting for refills until we reminded her. Hardly checked on us. Bottomless fries were the only redeeming factor. Prob won't be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Don M.,"Nashotah, WI",0,2,,1.0,12/6/2014,"Horrible service.  They will keep the waiting area full of people, and have many tables sit empty throughout the restaurant.  We counted 6 tables empty, and they stayed empty for 20 minutes or more!  Meanwhile, people are sitting/standing in the waiting area.  Makes no sense, other than making it appear to be a popular place, when in fact, it is very average.  I think this may be part of their business model.  We have noticed this trend a few other times. After a long, frustrating wait, we were seated.  Then the next wait began.  15 minutes for a waitress to show her face!   Never again!!!   I am done with Red Robin.  Go to a local tavern, or Fudruckers, just around the corner from this place in Brookfield.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Joe P.,"Milwaukee, WI",96,560,94,3.0,5/6/2013,"Descriptive phrase: Surprisingly delicious pub-grub saturated in flair. I came to Red Robin at Brookfield Square recently with a coworker for a quick lunch. We were seated immediately by a peppy server at a tall barstool table. This place is kitschy to the max, with flair everywhere. Walls are covered with signs and photos, colors pop, and servers are always excited to serve. Our waitress was very attentive, but a little too laidback for my taste. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap. Our meals came out quickly, which was appreciated since we were on lunch break.  I really liked my meal. The spinach tortilla straddled that fine line between crispy and doughy where wraps should be, and the ingredients were plentiful. Lettuce, tortilla strips, ranch dressing, and chicken breast drenched in a sweet and tangy bbq sauce. Highly recommended. The steak fries were bottomless, but weren't good enough in my opinion to even finish my first helping. A little too raw still for my taste; I like'm a bit crispier. A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Sara S.,"New Berlin, WI",23,112,24,4.0,10/27/2014,"I had an enjoyable lunch here with my son.  He got the cheeseburger with fries and I got the Banzai Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. My son loved his and was happy to have several cheeses to choose from. My sandwich was actually too messy to eat with my hands so I ended up eating it with a fork and knife.  Just a tad too much sauce, I think.  The salad was fine...uneventful.  I should've gotten the bottomless broccoli.  My son though the bottomless fries was cool! Fun place to go with kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Julie L.,"Cedar Grove, WI",37,37,8,4.0,2/28/2015,I have never had bad service or meal here ever! I love their fries that are bottomless and there are bottomless drinks other then soda too. There is always a wait but they seem to always seat those waiting fairly fast.  I wish there was a Red Robin near us but its probably a good thing because it would be as special of a place to go for a birthday. This is a kid friendly clean restaurant to take your family to. I enjoy Red Robin when ever we go there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Janine S.,"Milwaukee, WI",32,11,9,3.0,10/16/2014,"I give them A for effort. Had the Whiskey River burger...done perfect medium rare as requested. But, toppings way to salty and meat very bland tasting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Melissa F.,"Milwaukee, WI",7,106,,4.0,12/15/2012,"Red Robin, yum indeed. Burgers are really good, fries are good (and bottomless). I like the freckled lemonade and their raspberry limeade. At our most recent experience, all the staff was excellent. Best service we've received at a chain place (especially when comparing similar places). Don't want a burger? Lots of chicken options as well. Some yummy sounded appetizers that I haven't tried yet, but don't worry, we'll be back! Parking can be a pain in the mall (if you've been to Brookfield Square, you know the structure of the lot in the front isn't the best). Not Red Robin's fault, but not fun to walk around the whole mall after a really full stomach. I also like that the only entrance is from the front of the restaurant, no mall entrance!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Jeff M.,"Milwaukee, WI",267,244,82,4.0,12/23/2010,"The Red Robins in Brookfield Square Mall is pretty new and you can definitely tell when you walk in. Very clean, bright and the staff still looks happy. Though, it wasn't very crowded around 6pm. We had a group of 5 and ordered a tower of Onion Rings... unfortunately the rings were a little moist instead of completely crispy. I was told to try to Royal Red Robin Burger... not the best burger with egg I've ever had, but it's up there. The egg actually covered the burger which was great, and the bacon was crispy and cooked nicely. The thing I wasn't a fan of was the dry steak fries. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal. They also had the Red Robin mascot come around to each table... great attraction for the kids, not so much for adults only tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Melanie B.,"Milwaukee, WI",128,304,92,3.0,4/5/2012,"Reddddddddd Robinnnnnnnnnnnnn.....Yummmm.. Okay now that we got that outta the way.  Yes, it was kind of Yummmm but I don't think I would go outta my way for a Red Robin burger in the future.  However, the server did intrigue me when she was talking about how good the Veggie Burger was.  I love Veggie Burgers and if it is a made-in-house veggie burger, then I usually fall in love.   This time I was craving the real burger though and that's what I got.  I got a regular cheese burger and added fried onion rings.  I was starving so I probably gobbled it way too fast however it didn't have tons of flavor that a burger really should have.  The bun was also really dry!  MINUS--I wasn't going to send it back for the bun though--I was way to hungry for that business! My husband got the sweet potato fries in lieu of the streak fries and I think I would make that choice next time.  I wasn't too crazy about the steak fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Curtis B.,"Milwaukee, WI",16,41,15,3.0,11/6/2011,"Red Robin will always hold a special place in my heart, it introduced me to something that I now must have on a burger when I get the chance.  Bacon and egg. I am sure the Red Robin is not the first place to add a fried egg to a burger and it's not even the best, but it is where I lost my egg on the burger flower.  Ever since then, I've been to red Robin a half dozen times and I can't get away from that Red Robin Royal burger.   It's good every time.  It's simple, a burger patty, cheese, bacon and egg (no onions, thanks), but they do a pretty tasty burger, even for a chain.  Add on to that bottomless steak fries (which are good, not great) and some pretty awesome bottomless virgin lemonades (or limeades/root beer floats) and you have the makings of one of my favorite chains.  Yeah, you can get a better burger locally, but Red Robin still gets the job done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40

Mark S.,"Milwaukee, WI",5,95,1,2.0,5/13/2011,"I tried Red Robin for the first time today and was less than impressed.  It wasn't too bad, but I must imagine I can get a better burger somewhere else in the area. I was with a group of about 7 others, and we all got burgers.  I ordered the A1 peppercorn burger and received it after everyone else was about half done, even the guy that joined our group about 15 minutes after we got there, so the service sucked. The burger was okay, but sort of a mess, and not in the good way.  I ordered my burger with 'some pink' and it actually came rather pink to the point where the burger was all together too mushy.  The fries were pretty bland, not nearly as good as 5 Guys fried.  They clearly favor quantity over quality offering bottomless fries. I'll probably be back, but won't get a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
Steven T.,"Milwaukee, WI",91,965,11803,3.0,10/11/2013,"It's no oscars pub but it was ok. They can't do rare at all because it was void of any red meat. I had the guacamole burger which didn't have much guacamole flavor at all so I looked and if it was there it was spread very thin and didn't look anything like the picture, why do they allways show a picture of something that never looks like what you order. The movie falling down is so true and every one should see the restraunt scene because it's true. The frys were good and plentiful. For $ 10.00 you expect better when a whopper is $ 4.00 and is just a burger too. The toppings were fresh just like BK and it was tasty but not all that. I came, I saw and I tasted but this will not be a regular stop as long as oscars pub is around. It's ok if you around one but if you go out for a burger with a burger in mind this is not the place. Would I go back for lunch ? Yes because it's close and has great variety compared to Wendy's, MD and BK. I just expected more. For me it's over priced and under the wow factor for what they claim. Now after all being said its a chain restraunt and Oscars, Soblems and Pistol Pete's is where the burger lives if you want better than average burger where rare is cooked correctly or any temp you want.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40
D L.,"Tri-Cities, WA",0,83,,4.0,1/22/2015,I love the bottomless steak fries here. They literally come in a container without a bottom. The other food is tasty too.

Insun M.,"Bloomingdale, IL",29,248,22,1.0,8/10/2011,"I've only been to one other Red Robin and this one is a sad sad comparison. The food was just simply BLAND. We got the guacamole burger and mushroom burger and both were horribly bland. Good thing the fries were good at least.  Also ordered the macaroni and riblet platter. The only cheese on the macaroni was layered on top and none of the noodles below it had any trace of cheese. The riblets were burnt.

Amy P.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,90,11,4.0,1/27/2012,Red Robin was a little better than i expected.  I went for lunch with my 4 yr. old around 11:30.  We were able to get a table right away and our server was very attentive.  I wanted something healthy so i ordered the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad.  Very good!  I should have asked to hold the deep fried peppers.  I did sample one and it was yummy.  My son ordered the mac & cheese. He was happy with the order.  I like the number of options with the kids meal along with the crayons & coloring page to keep them occupied.  I will return if i'd like something a little more than fast food when i'm at the mall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40

We didn't have to wait very long (maybe 10-15 mins) which is not bad at all for a Friday night. The service was fantastic. The food was definitely good and the prices were reasonable.

Kim S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,101,11,2.0,8/17/2012,"We got there at 6:30 on a Sat. night and were told there was a 15 min. wait. That's fine.....but I never expected to have to wait almost 45 mins. Next after we were seated it took an additional 10 mins. before the waiter came and asked for our drink order.........then we waited over 10 more mins. waiting for the drinks. He never did come back to take our food order, we had to flag him down. He was also taking care of 2 other booths and a party table of 20. He was definitely catering to this larger group which was very obvious. After we ordered it took 20 mins. to get our food. Mind you, we're with our 2 granddaughters (8 & 7 yrs. old). They did great until we had to wait that long for our food. The food was ok, I had the tortilla soup which was god awful and 3.99 for a bowl of it???? The burgers were very good and the fries were outstanding, nice and hot & crispy. The kids food from the childrens menu was awful and WAY overpriced for a kids meal. I tasted the mac 'n cheese one of them ordered and I had to agree with my granddaughter that it was not very good. It was like a bowl of soup. Anyway, I won't be returning to Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=60
