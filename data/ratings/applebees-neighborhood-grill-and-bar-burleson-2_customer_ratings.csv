0,L R.,"Burleson, TX",2,49,,1.0,2012-03-31,"Generally I will always try a place twice before I write it off.  But this one is a no-brainer to me.  It had been years since I ate at an applebees- there are just too many other, better, options in Burleson along the restaurant row.  Deciding to try something different, we chose this place and after being seated in the nearly empty dining area on a Sunday evening, ordered the chips and salsa appetizer, which came recommended.    The chips were thick and stale, and the salsa tasted like tomato paste.  No flavor at all.  When my pasta with ""Italian breaded"" chicken breast came, it soon became obvious that they used a southern seasoned (likely pre-made and reheated) chicken breast with more paste-like tomato sauce on top.  The sauce on the pasta was greasy and, being a trooper, I just tried to eat it anyways since there were no employees within sight.   When our waitress finally came by and asked how everything tasted, I told her, ""Ehh, its okay."", at which point she started to scold me for not telling her sooner- I was only a few bites into the meal.She then brought out the manager to our table, who also blamed me for not saying something, and then the waitress when I told her no one was around.   Finally she offered to get me something else, but because I was on the verge of tears at that point I politely declined and asked for my check.  They did omit that dish from the check, which was nice, but I was just very unhappy from my service, which went from bad to worse.  I really do hate complaining or sending back food, and due to the embarrassment I incurred there, I will not be going back. Applebees seems to lack brand identity nowadays... if you drive past at 1AM there are a ton of cars and you can see the bar is packed, so if you are a 30-something single perhaps it is a good place to go.  But because this is a lackluster option in an area crowded with tens of different restaurants, go elsewhere if you want a decent meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2?start=20,,,,,
22,Michael M.,"Burleson, TX",7,32,26.0,3.0,2013-02-11,"Previous reviews for this location must have been before the renovation.  Sadly they didnt paint a very good picture of the restraunt. All wrong.... Clean, warm, inviting and very friendly staff.  I found that the food was spot on and even the pretzles (Deep fried) were better than those I get at my most favorite TGI Fridays.  Lunch here is a pleasure.  Will and have returned many times.  I would reccommend this place to all my friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
2,Pat Q.,"Fort Worth, TX",90,128,180.0,3.0,2014-03-05,I ordered the steak lunch off their 550 calories or less portion of their menu.  It was really good.  I was surprised that it was truly so low in calories.  The flavor was all there and the server was attentive. The Manager was very personable and came by several times to talk with us and make sure the food was to our liking.  The only negative I had was that I thought the price was a bit too high.  My lunch was $11.99.  Either reduce to $9.99 or add a side salad to keep at $11.99.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2?start=20,,,,,
20,Meghan F.,"Fort Worth, TX",96,16,,5.0,2015-08-05,On 7-30-15 my mom and I went for dinner. We are in a weight loss competition so there are very few things we could eat. The manager spent time with us and went over items that would be approved on our program. He was soooo helpful and so professional. He was vivacious and attentive to all of the guests around us including the other employees. He honestly loves what he does and we felt it as soon as we walked in the door. We will return to this location because of the manager and the excellent staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
1,J J.,"Lynden, WA",2,18,,2.0,2015-11-19,"Meh. Asked waitress what beers on tap she named the usual swill and ""another one I can't remember""...but wouldn't go find out which one. I wanted Blue Moon (which they had and I was pretty sure they did) but she didn't know. Easily fixed if you ask another waiter or bartender. She just stood there. My steak was ordered medium rare, it was well. Ordered sautéed mushrooms on it, it had none. Appetizer came before my gf got her drink, had to remind waitress to bring her drink. This could probably have been avoided if she had written our order down rather than try to remember it. Service not so great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2?start=20,,,,,
21,Ron M.,"Alvarado, TX",0,1,,1.0,2015-12-18,"First off, I love Applebee's. Especially the chicken wonton tacos. But this location in Burleson needs to have their franchise license yanked. The last 2 times I TRIED to eat there I could not get waited on and the place was filthy. I sat for 15 minutes at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and no one even acknowledged my presence. The first time I thought was just a fluke. My second visit was even worse. I will keep eating at Applebee's, just never again at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
12,Bill M.,"Crowley, TX",0,4,,1.0,2016-01-25,"Buyer Beware of this Place. I am a regular at Applebee's, my friend's wife and kids were out of town so we had a Monday's, Guys out! We went to the  Burleson, Tx Applebee's. We ordered the bottomless wings for two, 2X 9.99. We also enjoyed the beverage selection and we can eat! The bartender gave us our bill and we were charged for individual wing orders. The bartender could not help us with the 100.00+ tab with wings priced individually. During our dinner were asked to take some home?? I figured this was a tipping point for ten nuggets, that's ok but (Nope, it's a Set-Up)... We asked for the Manager he finally showed but was hung around the axle about the suggested (Take Out)!!!! The Manager made a point of (Oh, you wonted to take some home?)! No, Slick not my plan it was suggested! Welcome to Texas, I'll pay for the 9.99 and pay for a take home ( Not my Plan) but a set-up for individual appetizer priceing. Both I and my fellow workers (Army) love Applebee's but not this clip joint! What happened to this place in the last few months?? The bartender is over worked and not appreciated. SHAME ON YOU! Applebee's!! What happened to your good reputation?:( .. Can one give a negative star?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
13,Brithany G.,"Dallas, TX",9,58,113.0,5.0,2016-03-20,"Came for a late bite and drink. Originally going to TGIF but they were closed even though according to their hours of operation, they should have been open for another hour. However it worked out! Got seated at the booth with Sam. Typically sit at the bar but noticed it was smoking and kinda disappointed.  Anyway, Sam was very friendly and got our order right without writing it down. He was very attentive and made us laugh. Decent time and decent food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
17,J T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,2,,1.0,2016-03-31,"We've never been to Applebee's before. I saw a commercial on TV for the Quesadilla burger and it looked delicious (mainly because we love quesadillas). I picked several up today...spent almost $50 on them, and it was all bad. After an hour's drive home, we were ready to eat. The meat had zero flavor. A pinch of salt or pepper would have been great. The quesadilla was soft and flavorless. There was a little bit of bland watery sauce and a few strings of what looked like lettuce in it. If it's a quesadilla burger, it should have decent sauce and cheese. Not just plain hamburger meat and a yellowed tortilla.   There is no outside signage pointing me as to where I should park - so I parked in front. I placed my order online, using my phone. I selected carside service. Since it asked me for the model and make of my car, I assumed carside meant my order would be brought out to me. Wrong, I guess. It showed completed on my phone and I waited past the time it said it should be ready. I finally went inside and was pointed to a small unmarked doorway in the very back. I had to squeeze through a dark, packed bar to get to the small counter. The employee said I needed to pay for the order. I said that I paid online with my CC. She said I didn't. So we stood there as I pulled it up on my phone and showed her. She said the receipt didn't print, gave me the food, and I left. I wish I had gone to Schlotzsky's or Taco Cabana. I'll assume not all Applebee's are like this?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,

16,Summer T.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,,1.0,2016-05-21,"First off, the smell of cigarette smoke just about knocks you down as soon as you enter the building. We were seated close to the back where the stench was still really strong.  I am not one that enjoys huffing cigarette smoke as I try to enjoy a meal.  I ordered what looked on the menu to be a nice meal with sliced zucchini and squash. Sliced, my butt!!! The cook simply chopped them in half and put grill marks on one side. Couldn't even eat the raw veggies.  All the steaks ordered at our table were over cooked.  This was the third time in a row our experience here was horrible.  Not my idea to dine there, but definitely will be the last time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,

Service was extremely slow and not everyone got their food at the same time. They blamed it on a computer error that the tickets got mixed up. There we're maybe 6 tables full in the restaurant.

9,Helter S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,24,4.0,1.0,2016-10-11,"Cold food, rude waitress, Birthday ruined. This location is always terrible, Applebee's is great, steer clear of this one, though... The waitress was rude. Legitimately rude, short and didn't even pretend to smile. I wish I remembered her name, but she was never around so I never saw a name Badge. I brough my husband and sister here for my sister's birthday dinner. Waitress was cold and seemed to be in a hurry even though after watching her like a hawk I never saw her stop at another table. We were her only table. She ran off so fast after we placed our order I didn't get the chance to tell her I didn't want what I'd originally ordered and wanted a substitute. She was nowhere to be found so I had to walk up to the hostess stand for service. When the check came we were overcharged for the plate I substituted and the waitress looked annoyed to have to change it. We waited for 10 minutes with cold, empty food plates in our faces for her to come correct the ticket. Then when she dropped  off the corrected check she ran off (literally) again and we had to wait even longer for her to return to collect our payment. Sorry, but if your job and your customers annoy you that bad go home. My table was nothing but nice to her. It was my sister's BIRTHDAY. This waitress, with ONE table, never even offered us dessert. I actually wanted to order a Dessert for my sister but I guess the waitress didn't want us there any longer I'm guessing because of the speed in which she slapped our ticket on the table. My Husband ordered the Mac n Cheese plate with Chicken Strips. The Chicken strips on top of it were good and crispy but the Mac N Cheese was lukewarm, not cheesy (had dried cheese on it like it had sat under heatlamp for a while) and had a pile of cold honey at the bottom of the dish. My sister's burger was cold and stiff like a fast food burger. My Bourbon Chicken came out and was not even sizzling. :'(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
14,Kendall B.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,81,33.0,2.0,2017-03-18,"The past 3 times I've gone to this location I've regretted it. Last time I got the grilled chicken breast with sweet potato fries and broccoli, the broccoli was good, the chicken was hard as a rock and all dried out and they gave me the smallest portion of sweet potato fries I had ever seen, I paid $1 more just for the fries. My husband got the Parmesan Steak and Shrimp and asked for double sweet potato fries and he was given the same amount of fries as me. My kids were given more regular fries than either of us. My husband caught the Waitress Kasondra and told her that he was missing an order of fries... she replied ""no, that is what they consider a double order"" my husband said ""well I'm paying $2 extra for this ""double order"" so could you take that off the bill because my wife has the same amount"". Kasondra said ""no, but I could get you more"". My husband agreed and Kasondra walked away from the table and rolled her eyes at him as she turned, my sister and I both saw her. A few minutes later she brought him more SP fries however they were burn't, and I mean hard and black, like she had picked them out out of the bottom of the fryer. My husbands steak was undercooked, like rare and he asked for medium, there was a lot of blood on the plate and my sisters  steak was overcooked. Yesterday was a very bad experience. The time before last I ordered the Cedar Lemon Grilled Chicken and the chicken was not cooked, it was rubbery they took it back and recooked it but I don't know what's been going on with the way they cook things there, I'm gonna be taking my business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
11,Jill B.,"Crowley, TX",0,7,,1.0,2017-03-24,"I was there today around 2 pm with my daughter and grandkids. It was not crowded or busy accept the bar. We were in a booth and around us there were only 2 other tables being used. My point to this is the older couple behind us   I'm back was to them and heard the husband say "" are you choking? ) when I turned around she was already starting to change color. She stood up I and I did 3 thrust before it broke loose. A gentleman from the other side of the restaurant saw and came to help. Not one waitress or manager came to check on her at all. I know I saw a waitress at 1 point. Not one employee came to help or show concern. I didn't want to embarrass her anymore than needed so I went outside and called the manager. Johnathan came on the line and I told him he could have cared less. No concern at all. My issue is if nobody was around what would have happened because she was trying to get up to go to the restroom which would have been fatal. It was not busy there is no reason. Thank you to the gentleman who came to assist from the other side of the restaurant because had we not been there to help no telling what would have happened. The fact that Johnathan could not even try to care concerns.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,

We went around 4 or 5 pm on a weekend.  Not crowded and we were visiting from out of town.  Seemed to be we were in for a pleasant experience but that wasn't the case. Being in Customer Service field I'm not looking to grade but looking for differences to compare.  We were seated and were told someone would be over to take our order.   1. Sticky menus are my pet peeve  2. Dirty or sticky table is next 3. Ignoring us  All three of these situations presented itself  I noticed someone doing what appeared to be cleaning in the area where we would be seated  but apparently our table was missed. The table was sticky as well as the menus.  Another family was seated directly across from us to which one of the wait staff approached almost immediately after being seated. We promptly left the establishment due to the possibility poor service. If the place isn't cleaning to begin with, who's to say the kitchen where the meals are prepared is or the person preparing is practicing cleanliness.. .nevermind the service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
4,Dana D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,11,,1.0,2017-07-07,"I do not normally write bad reviews but I just had to with the experience we received last night. We had 5 of us come in around 7. The waitress, I think her name was BREE,  was horrible. The service was just ok but her attitude was so shitty that I will NEVER go back, she snatched receipts out of my friends hands, got a round of drinks when no one wanted another, when we asked who ordered these, she just shrugged and said I thought y'all wanted another so I got y'all one, who does that? Then at the end, she asked two of my friends if they wanted to be on one ticket, they did. But then one found that she didn't have enough cash so we asked if it would be a big deal just to 1/2 it one on the credit card one for cash! OMG, you think we asked her for her shoes! She was PISSED and said I ASKED Y'ALL if you wanted on one ticket, Well guess what BREE, shit happens!  Her attitude and hers only is the reason none of us will go back to this store, one of us who is a server herself stayed back to tell the manager about her, HE SAID HE COULD CARE LESS, Well buddy if you don't care, I sure dont care to bring my $$ to your establishment. She must of been having a bad day but in the hospitality industry you cannot bring that shit to work. So goodbye Applebees Burleson, I am sure you could care less,  I will be going to Hulen or Arlington or anywhere but here. Bree should work for the DMV! She would fit right in.

So I stopped her and ask her who bought the round of drinks for us she said oh no I just brought on myself really who does that I don't know I'm a waitress and I have never in my life just decided to order around a drinks for a table without their permission very unprofessional so then we got our checks and two of the girls asked to split their check and half yanked the check out of her hand and took it and stormed off then brought it back so very rude of her we were there for almost 2 hours we would have definitely kept her at least fifty bucks but instead she got about 12 really sad that you had to be treated like that because he think you're not going to get a good tip if you would have been a sweet girl and did your job properly he would have got a great tip don't think I'll be visiting the bar at Applebee's anytime soon,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-burleson-2,,,,,
