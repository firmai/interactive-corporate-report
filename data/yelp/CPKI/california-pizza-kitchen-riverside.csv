Asma A.,"Fort Myers, FL",6,76,30,3.0,7/22/2017,"It was my first time here we were started with agree appetizer which was good. We ordered vegetarian pizza and barbecue chicken pizza, barely any sauce or cheese on both pizzas just an average pizza,we were expecting more, I like how it's made fresh but the flavors were off. We ordered a salad with BBq chicken and it was delicious. The food is very overly priced for such small portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=20
Di M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,12,25,1.0,5/20/2017,"7 months pregnant, almost 100 degrees outside and my toddler urgently needed to use the restroom so I thought, perhaps, they would allow me to use the restroom at CPK. It was my first time visiting Riverside Plaza so I didn't realize there was a public restroom. Nonetheless I was hoping they would be understanding at CPK and help a momma out. The older woman with dark black hair who opened the door greeted me kindly until I asked if my toddler could please use the restroom. She looked annoyed, completely changed her attitude, and told me coldly that in the future I needed to use the public restroom and pointed in some direction outside. While I sort of understand why they have these ""policies"" but I wasn't really asking for too much - a little kindness from one human to another perhaps? I wondered: if I were a man would this woman have treated me the same? If I were white?  Would it have mattered if she knew I were a doctor? None of that should matter.  I shouldn't have to show credentials (by way of skin color, gender, or degrees) to be treated with a little respect and humanity. But I am quite certain that any of those descriptors would have changed the way she responded to me. Anyway, recognizing that I was not wanted I went ahead and told her ""okay I will go find the public restroom."" When I arrived it was closed.  This was my first experience at this CPK and will likely be my last. I hope that the door lady feels wonderful and powerful knowing she upheld the all-important ""customers only"" restroom policy at CPK.  Pretty sad...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=20
James M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",128,233,424,4.0,6/13/2016,"CPK....I'm kinda biased.  I love this place.  The service is usually spot on and this one did not disappoint.  I ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls and my buddy got the all mixed meats pizza.  Both items came out together and in a timely manner.  Both were piping hot as well.  The ice tea glass was never less than half full before refilling by staff.   This location is in an extremely busy center.  The wait was 15-20 minutes, but we walked right in at the bar.  If you make it over to this location, expect to wait, but give it a whirl!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=20

The chicken  lettuce wraps were good ( the dipping sauce good). They changed up their potstickers.

Mandy M.,"San Clemente, CA",2,38,2,4.0,7/24/2017,"A good place to go if you want pizza in a casual environment but nicer than Pizza Hut, dominos, or other similar eateries. The restaurant is very stylish and they have a wide selection of food. The pizza isn't the best I've ever had and it's somewhat pricey, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars. However my dining experience here has always been pleasant, except for one time a bug crawled on the table but even then it was was an overall a positive experience haha. The wait staff is professional and courteous, their healthy meals are tasty, and it is a pleasant environment to eat.

David B.,"Riverside, CA",3,9,,1.0,9/4/2017,(Written by Anita Bonner) We just left one of our favorite spots to get dinner. Not busy but they had a couple of large party's already seated. Our drink orders were taken by the hostess. As we sat at our table without service. I looked around to see who our server might be hoping they would see us in their section. I made eye contact with a chef (in a white jacket) walking by. He immediately came over to our table and asked if we'd been helped. We told him no and he took our order. During this time our server came over very apologetic stating she had a large party she was attending to. She made jokes with the chef and left to place our order. CPK like most restaurants has shared servers so we received our order from another server. I asked the server if he'd bring us extra dressing for our salads. He said yes but never returned. We started eating waiting for the salad dressing after about 7or8 minutes I went to the bar to ask for the dressing. Another server brought it to the table. By the time our server came back to our table we were nearly finished eating. I told her her that I didn't feel that she gave us the best service tonight. She asked why and I explained that she never came to the table even after she had apologized for not being attentive in the beginning of her service. I had to go to the bar and ask for the salad dressing we also needed refills. She went to get the refills and brought it back to the table. We never saw her again. Instead a manager came to the table (She was possibly sent) asked if we needed anything... I asked for our check. After we paid we explained how the service had been and shared our disappointment. Again she apologized and thank me for sharing my concerns she also offered me a $15.00 gift card. I didn't accept the gift card but I did accept the apology. We always have a choice in where we spend our hard earned dollars. Poor service is never acceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=20
Silvester G.,"Riverside, CA",0,22,9,5.0,10/7/2016,"From the get go, our server Jude was very well spoken, well mannered, knowledagble, and extremely fast with any and all requests we had. We experienced a small problem during our experience. My girlfriend's cocktail had a small bug(in a strawberry). I sympathize with the staff because I know that it's not entirely their fault, nor is it our servers fault. But Jude was extremely professional and apologetic. His manager returned to our table, as well as the bartender to ensure we were completely happy. The chef even came out and brought us our dishes when they were ready. The staff really did go above and beyond on a busy Friday night to ensure me and my girlfriend were completely satisfied. I will be coming back soon and will be requesting Judes section.  I ordered the Moroccan chicken salad and it was absolutely amazing. Probably one of the best salads I've ever had. It had dates, eggplant, beets and a champagne vinaigrette. Really complex flavors, and to be frank not usually something I expect from a franchise restaurant. Definite kudos to the chef.  We also ordered the Silician pizza. Pretty solid. The sausage was very very good, and the crust was baked well. Will be back soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=20

We asked what she recommend as far as wine and desert and she was on point! The manager at the time found out that we had not been there in a good while & brought us a complimentary appetizer.

We waited 20 which turned into 25 we asked if our table was ready we were told it was being prepared for us and will be ready shortly. The wait turned into 30 to 35 minutes, at this point were getting annoyed we ask once more of our table is ready as we see several empty tables available. We were told that sorry were not getting a table because they  have tables for 13 and a few of 9 that called in . So at this point were not getting a table. Very rude, and inconsiderate don't lie and say our table is being prepared and then say we're not going to be seated .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=40
Vincent P.,"Alhambra, CA",280,299,602,4.0,11/13/2015,"Business students attending UC Riverside should be familiar with this place. The good o' spend $30 a meal for extra credit. Bring a friend to split $15/15! Professor Jasso sure does know how to strike a deal. I'm pretty sure I've spent at least $80~ dollars here over the course of four years. So for now, I'm on a bit of a CPK break, okay?  Anyways, CPK does serve some good food. The dining experience is nice with a darkly lit ambience and the waiters are always excited to serve. It does get hectic when its busy causing it to be difficult to flag down your server. Nevertheless, my dining experience was good.  On the contrary, I don't order pizza here. I usually get the Pesto Cream Penne with sun-dried tomatoes and chicken. This dish is so delicious, I love the pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. Prices are so expensive though. Definitely shouldn't be a regularly visit.  Now that I'm done with my college career, my yearly CPK visits are finally over!

Annette O.,"Fontana, CA",41,16,22,4.0,9/24/2015,"We had a good time. Had the kiddos so asked for the option to sit on the patio under the night summer sky. I ordered the Chimay reserve by accident but we made the$15 bottle worth the buy. We ordered their Maine Lobster Flat bread, Jambalaya Fettuccine, a kids crispy chicken and kids personal pizza. The first two were plenty enough for us two and our two girls to share delectably. Both dishes had just enough spice flavor. When you order off of the kids menu, you already know what they like or don't. The crispy chicken wasn't horrible, but it leaned toward the drier side tonight. You can't go wrong with the pizza so that was gone. We had a friendly wait staff.

The old interior design was screaming 1999 so it was long overdue. The new design of the menu is a little more simplified and the offerings for lunch are fantastic. Great new selections.

The service here is usually nice, considering i come between lunch and dinner rush. The atmosphere had a very calm but welcoming aura that when we are seated we can enjoy our meal. I usually get the garlic cream fettuccine with chicken and mushrooms to meet the $15 mark. Definitely something I always enjoy and the taste is pretty consistent! You can also ask for additional sauce for no charge at all! My friends usually get the pizzas which is their specialty. The thai chicken pizza is good if you like that peanut sauce taste and the margarita pizza cant go wrong. If you want something more meaty, there is the mushroom pepperoni and sausage that a lot of my guy friends enjoyed. They do offer light entrees but I never feel like its worth it.

Bridget P.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",814,996,100,4.0,1/4/2013,"My brother and I took my mom here for Christmas Eve dinner... she had never been to a CPK. Haters always hate on chain restaurants like this, but I've always liked CPK.  We ordered the mushroom pizza, jamaican jerk chicken pizza, cobb salad, and the corn-avocado stack appetizer. CPK has a new menu of apps around $3, which is pretty nifty. Ours was forgotten, so we got it on the house. The food wasn't something I'd crave or really want to come back for, but it was good. The jerk chicken pizza pulled off the spicy/sweet combo in an unusual way. I actually liked the salad the best, even though it was so simple.  I don't usually go to CPK to get slizzard.... it's usually for a work lunch for family thing, so I didn't notice how CHEAP wines by the glass were! There wasn't much over $6! I took advantage and had two. My mom was there, after all. Wine and beer selection is a little lacking, but it's cheap. Maybe it was the company, but we had a great Christmas Eve dinner here, lingering, catching up, telling stories, and talking shit. Just how a good family gathering should be.

Lisa C.,"Grand Terrace, CA",627,85,1641,4.0,4/1/2014,"I've been to several California Pizza Kitchen but  this location is one of my favorites.  CPK has a variety of items on it menu such as a variety of different pizza topping combination, to pasta entrees, & sandwiches for those who may not want pizza. First of all, ever time I've come into eat here I'm greeted by a friendly happy host & I've never have had to wait to be seated more than ten minutes. And the waiter or waitress have been quick to come and get a drink order while we look over the menu & they are quick to point out whatever specials they currently have. Secondly, after our order is taken our salads & appetizers are promptly on our table within 7mintue or so. And if the appetizers we order are supposed to be hot it comes out hot like the flat bread I ordered. However, if its supposed to be cool like the salad I ordered then it served cool. Thirdly, the pizza crust is always perfectly cooked  crispy & which ever combination of topping the menu describes is what is on the pizza.

Melissa S.,"Corona, CA",228,127,16,1.0,3/27/2015,"Came on a Sunday night and it was my boyfriends first time trying CPK. We were told we had about a 5 or 10 minute wait and only had one party in front of us. 20 minutes  and 3 parties seated later (two of which were 2 people like us, and one with 5 people- all came after us), we were sitting in the lobby and the serving staff was trying to convince us to sit on the porch in the wind and cold because they realized they had skipped us and wanted to get us seated. We werent upset because accidents happen and we had come a little earlier than we usually eat so we told them we would wait for a table inside...... and then we were ignored for another 15 minutes while other people were seated or greeted. Get to the table and they are in the middle of a remodel so its dark and disheveled around our table. The waitress tells us the bread is in the oven and will be right over to us... 10 minutes later she takes our drink order and apologizes again that we don't have any bread and says she will be right back... another 10 minutes goes by and she comes back to take our order and remembers that she forgot the bread. She takes the order and then sets off again for the bread, which we never asked for but now that we have been waiting to eat we really are looking forward to.  Drinks get dropped off and then about 15 minutes later our food arrives and our waitress again apologized about not getting the bread for us and she is sorry the food came out first. We were pleasant and never said a word about the service the whole night because we were hungry and just wanted a nice Sunday night dinner date but I couldn't believe how horrible it was. The food was great but I didn't get a refill on my drink until I asked for the check and a box.  The check arrived, the refill arrived but no box. I left the payment, I left a tip for her effort and I left my leftovers on the table. I don't think it was a very good first impression for my boyfriend and I don't think I will be back to CPK for awhile... and probably not this one if I do go.  California Pizza Kitchen is not supposed to be a run of the mill dinner option, it is supposed to be a premium pizza restaurant with outstanding service to match their quality and pricing. I unfortunately had better service at Denny's that morning than I did at CPK.

There is no rule, you know!  Ask for whatever dressing you like... something tells me the salad will be good regardless.

Chris T.,"Riverside, CA",65,124,360,4.0,12/15/2011,"My best friend and I are very indecisive people. When we planned to have a dinner date, of course, we couldn`t decide where we wanted to go eat. We tried to think of where we hadn`t gone in a while, and CPK was the first place that we thought of. It wasn`t that busy, but we had to wait a while for a table. Once we got seated, we looked over the menu for a while, and ordered a Chicken Chipotle Pizza and the Pesto Cream Penne to share. They have complimentary bread that they serve, but sometimes you have to ask for it. I`m not a big fan of their bread, but my friend wanted it. I`m more of a hot bread kind of person. It`s so much more satisfying to eat when it`s hot and fresh. CPK`s bread is cold. Not room temperature cold, but taken out of the fridge and let it sit out for a while cold. Bleh... The Chipotle Chicken Pizza is a favorite of mine. It`s THE pizza that I always get when I come to CPK. It has chicken, chilies, and cheese sitting on a spicy sauce with a black bean and corn salsa on top. I can`t take spicy food all that well, so I ask for ranch on the side to cut a little bit of the heat. The Pesto Cream Penne is really good too. I`ve had it once before and I really enjoyed it. It has chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, parmesan cheese, chicken (for an additional charge), and a delicious pesto cream sauce. The last time I had it, the sauce was more green. This time, it took the color of the sun-dried tomatoes. It didn`t really matter because it still tasted yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=140

Creative toppings trump simplicity and pure love and skill poured into making a crust. On my most recent trip I settled on splitting a grilled veggie salad (I actually think the salads are better than the pizzas here) and a mushroom pizza. We made the call to add red sauce to our pizza and I was impressed of being offered an option of a few different kinds.

About a month ago we went to CPK being in the mood for some pizza. The hostess took us to our table and was very kind and friendly. When our waiter finally arrived. There were way too many mistakes or should I say - excessive rude treatment.? First, he did not give us plates, nor napkins, nor utensils for our appetizers. (We let that one go) Second, when we finally received our order he did not give us plates (again) nor any parmesan cheese and pepper. (My boyfriend had to bother and ask to receive all this ""standard"" stuff.) *He mentioned that he was getting trained to work on the bar, and that's why he was not completely there.* Third, he NEVER bothered to ask us if we wanted any refills or anything else. Fourth, at some point at the end of our dinner some other waitress (whom was not our server by the way) came to our table and without asking if we wanted refills just gave us refills. Made me think, is this lady deaf? Can't she ASK us if we want any before she barges in our business? She never bothered to say a word. (Did I mention it was at the end of our dinner? It's too f-ing late lady, I volutarily produced more saliva to get my pizza to go down!) Fifth and last, the worse out of our terrible experience in this CPK was the long a## wait for the check. Our waiter took too long to give us our check. He CLEARLY ignored us... And he ALSO didn't give us a pen. We waited longer to get him to pay attention to us for a pen. He NEVER apologized for anything. I'm assuming it's normal and okay to treat customers in that form. If you're wondering if we tipped this poor level waiter, the answer is ""hell no""!

Malik A.,"Riverside, CA",10,4,5,4.0,1/24/2014,Me and my colleagues went to this CPK establishment after school(late afternoon). The hostess sat us in a near the front which was nice however put us in the middle of two sets of customers  when there was clearly more than enough empty seats in this part of the restaurant. The waitress was quick with the ordering and very nice and kind and attentive to what we wanted. However it took some time more than me am my colleagues would have liked to receive our food when I saw people who had gotten here some time after we had arrived gotten there food much quicker. The waitress wasn't pushing dessert down our throats like most establishments which I found refreshing. Although maintenance had begun vacuuming around us which I found could have waited being there a many of people and found it somewhat rude. The food was nothing spectacular however was CPK standards.

One was another Fettuccine pasta and the other was a small side of Quesadilla. Both tasted good.  Price wise, everything was super expensive, but i was already expecting that when coming here to CPK, Their portions seemed super small. Each pasta looked like it serves only 1 person.

Raechel F.,"Corona, CA",88,5,,1.0,9/5/2013,"As a pharmaceutical representative in the Riverside area and having spent many thousands of dollars here on large catering orders, I was very dissapointed by my experience here with take-out today.  There was a mix-up for a catering order that I had to pick up and deliver to the other side of Riverside.  I had to go back to pick up the part of the order that got left off.  When I got back to the restaurant, I was informed by the manager that he and his staff did not make the mistake and the order was not placed correctly.  I told him that regardless I need to fix it with the office I delieverd to and wanted the remainder of my order.  He told me I was going to have to pay for it because it was the office who took the order's mistake and not his. This explaining of how he was not at fault went on for several minutes as my customers are waiting for their food.   When I told him that it is not okay for me to have two charges for the same event for expense purposes and that I do tons of business with his restaurant on a weekly basis anyway, the manager told me that he has tons of business anyway and it doesn't matter to him if he loses mine.   It is very sad that a company who prides itself on customer service would hire such an incompetant and highly rude individual to be a manager.  Pharmaceutical reps make up a large majority of the lunchtime business in that particular location, and I will do my best to make sure that every rep and doctor's office in the area hears about this incident and the condescending nature of its manager.  I will never support that location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=180

The service is usually decent and sometimes ehh on busy nights, which is a little understandable. But today I had my worst CPK experience.  I went in Thanksgiving Friday noon and was greeted by a nice young lady who told me about the new rewards card system. Which was nice because I eat at CPK quite often. Sat down, our server, Ricky took my order, and everything went as usual.  I asked Ricky for a basket of bread. After waiting for a while, I felt like he forgot. So I tried to catch someone's attention to remind him. But everyone would just pass by me like they didn't  see or hear me. And they wasn't busy at all. A server named Kim was just standing in front of the bar chatting away, right in front of me. And when her eyes met mines and she saw my hand she just tried to look away. she walked by my table and I said ""excuse me!"" She just rolled her eyes high and pretended not to hear or see me.  I understand the whole ""it's not my table thing."" But come on.. Your here getting paid and if your not busy is it really hard to just grab my server. She just posted leaning on the bar table with another lady who I couldn't see the name tag but and chatted. It was soo hard just to get anything I needed. My server was more concentrated on his bar duties than us. And he seemed almost annoyed to serve us. And trust me we weren't needy. All we wanted was a basket of bread before our meal and butter. Refill of water. Check and to go box. We spent more time trying to get someone to help us than eat. But there was a server named Maggie, she was amazing. Even though she was holding plates in her hands and she wasn't or server, she took the time to stop and ask what we needed. And she helped is every time. I almost felt bad that it was only her picking up everyone's slack. Well over all I'm super disappointed in CPKs service staff.

Sheila C.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,1,1.0,9/28/2014,"Disappointing and painfully slow. My daughter and I wanted to enjoy a later lunch on a lovely Sunday afternoon. CPK seemed to be a good choice.  The place was not busy and we got seated right away. Unfortunately, it took 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us at all. I had to call a server over to let them know we had been waiting. After getting water from the server I beckoned, a different server came over to get our drink order. It was still another 5-7 minutes before our server ever came over. She apologized for the wait, and took our order. I finally got the beer I ordered initially some 5-10  minutes later. But that was not the end of the painfully slow ordeal. It must have taken another 15 minutes before we got a salad to our table.  Finally our pizza order arrived, some 40 minutes after we were seated. After we ate, I asked our server why the service was so slow and why it took so long for us to get food. She apologized, said it was her mistake for not noticing us, and offered us a free desert. THEN SHE DISAPPEARED FOR ANOTHER 15 MINUTES!!! Once again, making us wait. By the time she returned, I was so exasperated, that all I wanted was the check. This type of service is completely unacceptable, with all the competition out there, we will definitely be taking our business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=80
Veronica R.,"Woodland, CA",51,137,147,4.0,1/12/2018,Came here on business travel and hadn't eaten all day.  I came in with the idea I would have a lighter meal like a salad.  That didn't happen.  I ended up having the short ribs and a sangria and it was soooooo good.  And to top it off I ate the entire entree simply because it tasted so good.   Service was ok.  I sat at the bar which is typical for me on business travel.  Bartender was nice enough but took a while to take my order and also cash me out.  I'd still return and order the same meal if it's on the menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside

I'm a regular at cpk and this review was based on one person. So I've edited my review to 5stars because I come here weekly and the service is always good, just not this one time.  I come to Cpk all the time. I always order the bbq chicken salad which is my favorite salad of all time. The food was great but the waitress we had needs to work on it. My daughter asked her for flavored tea so she offered to bring 2 diff syrups she can try, when she returned to the table she brought her a lemonade. She clearly was confused and not listening because we didn't order a lemonade. Then we asked her for bread as she did not automatically bring it to our table with the drinks. She again forgot that. I had to ask the waitress that ended up bringing our food to us to bring bread. Never came by our table to bring refills of my water. Then when I asked for the check and boxes for the pizza and the salad. She brings the Check with only a box for the pizza. Again not listening! Sigh. So I asked for the box again.

I also felt like splurging so I got the flavored lemonade...I had forgotten how yummy that was until I was consuming it on a hot, Riverside day. Highly recommend and unlimited refills!

Denise F.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,1,4.0,9/13/2017,"It is sad that good food does not always guarantee good service.  We had a large party (12), arriving for reserved dinner at 6:30. So it's not like we weren't expected.  Unfortunately for this staff on a Wednesday evening, we apparently were too much for the cook. Credit the waiter for trying his best, but he failed to bring any information on why there was a long delay in service. None of us had our orders at 7:45. Thus, the manager was summoned.    Perhaps another cook would be beneficial in granting more stars for this particular restaurant.  That said, my Crunchy Thai salad was delicious. But not worth waiting for over an hour. Update Added 10/12/17: To my surprise, management went above and beyond to rectify the 2 star rating I initially gave this restaurant!  It's highly likely I will return soon, because they've practicality begged, haha, but in all seriousness, their menu selections really are delicious",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside
Paul S.,"Tustin, CA",1373,444,3634,4.0,6/5/2016,"A quickie before the movie, CPK was a good choice overall. Since I arrived first I ordered for my friends who arrived just in time. I figured sitting at the bar would expedite the process, while not super smooth, we were accommodated well and received the food and drinks before showtime.  Cudos to the gal bartender who made me the delicious and refreshing Blueberry Ginger Smash cocktail featured on the menu. 5-stars for presentation and balanced taste (meaning alcohol was detected). I also had Samuel Adam's Summer Alex. Food: Appetizers, including the really delicious Avocado Roll. While I don't eat ranch dressing or its derivatives (I developed a lifetime aversion working in restaurants during undergrad), I found them delightful as is. Cut into six pieces it served three just fine. Next was the Flatbread, but I thought the price to value ratio quite low on account of the anemic size of the portion. While it tasted good, I'd certainly never order it again.  We paid and left.

Maribel S.,"Menifee, CA",6,24,13,3.0,4/2/2017,"My Reviews Preface: People have different taste buds and preferences. Some may like their food more/less salty, spicy, and seasoned, etc. Some may prefer mom-n-pops restaurants, others more fancy or both. Some prefer fresh & organic ingredients; others just want their food to taste ""good"". As far as customer service, I think that can be tricky based on people's personalities. So, I'm of the opinion that you try the place your looking to eat at & judge for yourself, unless there are horrid reviews of course. My Review: Food: ""White Corn Guacamole + Chips"" - wasn't very impressed. Had no flavor and I was expecting to be what the menu described in it's title and that is ""Guacamole"". It was more like small chunks of avocado mixed with the other ingredients. ALTHOUGH, in their defense, the menu did state diced avocado, HOWEVER, I expected it to have somewhat of a creamy consistency throughout. I wouldn't have this appetizer again.  Next, ""Chicken Tequila Fettuccine"": the pasta was not quite Al Dente, it was a hair under cooked but tolerable. At first glance, it was not an appetizing looking dish, it looked mostly ""earth toned"" and that didn't appeal to me. The taste, however, surprised me. I wasn't expecting it to taste good since I didn't like what I saw initially and it was also creamy. All the flavors described, however, did not deliver. I couldn't taste the tequila (nor was I expecting a strong flavor to come through) but I could taste a bit of the jalapeno, although it didn't hit the right spicy notes that I particularly wanted. Although it wasn't tasteless, I wouldn't try this dish again. Atmosphere: typical restaurant food chain Customer Service: Hostess was pleasant, greeted us well. Server was nice, not extremely attentive during the course of our lunch but I don;t prefer all the fuss while I eat anyway, just for my server to be available should I need anything further. Cleanliness: Adequate, at least in the eating area Price: typical price for such a restaurant $$ but I don't think the pricing was appropriate to the quality of food I received. Timing of Food: acceptable Overall: I would dine here again to try something else. Although it is a chain, I believe that our experience can vary from different restaurants due to who the cooks are and management of course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside

But thanks to me I'm showing off my grand master skills in packing. But before we do this chore, we grab a bite to eat for pick up. I tried something new in ordering. I did the online route. It was quick and easy. It gave options for date of meal, what is the time we wanted, too... the choice of curbside, pickups or delivery. We had plans to have a drink at the bar while we picked up our order. We walked in sat at the bar. Bartender asked what we would like, I told him I had placed an online order he said ok,but we would like to have a drink, he said no problem, let me get your name and check your order. He said it will be ready in a few min do you still want it to go. Mr.GC and I both said yes. I saw on the menu a new drink called Cha Cha Agua Fresca it really was refreshing. This is an alcoholic drink I might add. It had a chilly spice you could taste at the back of your throat. Mr.GC had a little sip while he enjoyed his tall blonde beer. Are meal was ready in no time, the bartender asked if there was anything else we would like extra; oils cheese,bread. We said yep, to all those things. Mr.GC's favorite meal is the tequila lime pasta w/chicken, I tried one of their new dishes. The spicy Chinese spaghetti w/ added chicken & shrimp. I have to say I was surprised on how spicy it really was; it definitely had a kick. Would totally order the drink and meal again while using the online ordering service.

It wasn't until near the end of our meals that we were able to flag down our server to ask for refills. We didn't get the refills until after we'd already finished our meals.  During the entire time we were eating, no one checked on us.  I certainly understand that restaurants can at times get hectic - that's why they still get 4 stars.
