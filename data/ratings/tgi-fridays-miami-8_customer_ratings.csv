The center of this mall has a built in lake w/huge rocks & waterfalls making it the most romantic mall ever.  The food in this TGIF is Pretty good, the service is great from my experience. And the bar has a 7 day happy hour special from 3-7 pm & 9pm - closing. Where the apps are 1/2 priced, well drinks $2, other drinks $4 & some beer specials. Good to sit, enjoy & watch a game. If you choose to sit in the restaurant side, make sure to sit next to the window for a cascade/lake view - this TGIF is romantic style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=120,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007

Went back for the first time last week. Nope. Just as amazing as it was the first time. If every TGIF in America could be like this TGIF then America would return to its former glory. Amazing service. Great atmosphere. DELICIOUS FOOD and at a great price! Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp here were more tender, juicy, crispy, and tasty than every toher TGIF. Compared to other good restaurants, it may even be better. Great steak fries which more potato than tasty grease. Really good bbq pasta, which really shocked me. The flatbread appetizer and mozarella sticks were okay.

62,Mark P.,"Miami, FL",35,3,22.0,2.0,2013-02-03,"Used to be a regular here, and maybe this place was always terrible and I never knew it due to my youthful naïveté.  But now that I'm older and wiser and drafting a review over a premium long island, It's clear this place has decent food, yet horrible service.  I'm here with my good friend and my gf. The staff here always got weeded (inable to cope with moderate traffic) with just a few people around the bar. Tonight is no different. The two bartenders on shift are both too busy talking to their significant others sitting amongst the other customers. I say ""significant others"" because that's the only explanation for the cuddling and kissing they engaged in during our visit. I don't usually mind witnessing love blossom, but it seemed out of place when you're waiting to make another drink order.  When I get frustrated while waiting for my drink, I usually scan the other patrons at the bar to see if they're also impatiently waiting for a refill. It helps me rationalize that I'm not being irrational, but instead, feel like part of a collective effort to capture the bartender's attention for the benefit of all of us. This unfortunately happened several times tonight.  Bottom line, this place is cool for celebrating your 14th birthday party in a booth with all of your best school chums while drugged-out 20-something's grudgingly sing ""happy birthday"" to you. But otherwise, don't expect much in terms of decent service from the bar.  And by the way, a ""premium"" ultimate drink isn't really really premium. It's mid-shelf booze.  Two stars for decent food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=100,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

My hubby and I wanted to go somewhere casual where we could sit down right away on a Friday night, so we went to TGI Fridays at the Falls. I grew up coming to this place as a kid, but this restaurant really needs to step up their game and renovate not only the restaurant but take a crane to lift up their staffs smiles. We sat at the bar thinking we would get fast service and it was way slower than sitting at a table. The male bartenders were slow, barely smiled, didn't seem like they wanted to be there and were NOT attentive at all.  We ordered 2 bottomless appetizers and 1 entre to share between my husband and I. We got the wings first and soon after came the potato skins. When we would finish with our apps we would have to get the bartenders attention after waiting 10 minutes with empty plates and drink glasses. We asked for another round of apps and they neglected to take the empty plates away. If you've ever eaten at a bar top you know that there isn't a whole lot of space.  Throughout the night, the bartenders would never check up on us - we always had to get their attention .... heck, they wouldn't even look at us!!   The service was terrible!!  The food is your typical TGI Fridays cuisine, so the food is nothing out of this world, but is good enough to top any wing, potato skin or any other craving you are having.

As the years have passed on by, I have seen the lines to go into this restaurant dwindling over time and for good reason. The waiters and hosts working at this location don't have any passion or interest in giving good customer service. Years ago, people had more spunk and charisma to take customers feelings into consideration. Now, all they care about is getting you out of the restaurant as soon as possible. The last time I went into Friday's was this past February and I was feeling a little apprehensive about it, but since I haven't been here in years, I decided to give it one more go and ordered their chicken bruschetta pasta and was surprised that I wasn't given two garlic toasts with my pasta. They always used to give toasts with their pasta and I guess they aren't giving out those anymore.

We went on Sunday, 11/22/15 at around 1:30 pm. When we walked in, we were hit by an awful stench. Like old beer mixed with bleach. We also wondered what to do because there was no sign and no hostess. I was about to go ask the bartender when a hostess came scurrying out. She was nice enough but tried to give us an ugly little deuce with a view of the kitchen. No thanks. We asked for a booth in the next room. Much more comfortable and there was actually some natural light. Our server was an older heavyset man (Stefan?) who was sarcastically friendly. That would have been ok had he been around when we needed more napkins or drink refills. My friend said he liked his seafood pasta. I got a cheeseburger, cooked medium, which came out extra well-done. Dry hockey puck. I'm not the type to send food back (the waiter had disappeared anyway), so I removed the dry bun and ate it. It came with a side of overly salty fries. The experience wasn't horrible but with so many great options in The Falls, I certainly won't be back.

130,Dalyah W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,1.0,2016-07-24,"Amy B. You must be from corporate because  you are full of it with your review! If  I could give no stars to this place i would the worst TGIF I've ever been too. Let's start from  the beginning. I understand Adults, kids, teens we are all humans  and deserve  to be treated with respect. If you are  a family looking to have  a nice dinner after a day at  the mall or before watching a good  movie at the cinema this  is not  the place  to go. For starters  they have kids working  there that have  no care in the world or even  know what  it is to  work in a place where customer service is so important. Coming in and signing  the waiting list is a joke  because  you could be  waiting  forever to be seated as the kids in the front  just  bump their  friends  that  come in from hanging at the mall all day and families patiently waiting never  get to be seated. It took  my family  and three others waiting about  11/2  before we realized  what was going on  with  the seating and we had to  all  go and complain to be seated. When  seated by one of their  young staff  who had no manners of how to treat  the guest we got no water  no utensil on the table and we literally had to call about  5 times to have  someone wait on us. When  finally  they  came they took our drink  order and didn't come  back for another half hour  with  the  drinks  to take  our dinner order. When  the dinner  came my nieces chicken, nuggets were ice cold and my sister  inlaws order  was completly incorrect. They offer  to  reheat the  chicken  nuggets and  replace my sister inlaws order but we  thought it was better to leave it that way. When the food was brought out we never  got utensils to  eat and  had to call  waiter  twice who never acknowledge us . I had to get one of the busboy  attention to see if he would bring us the utensil and  the kid  said with  a very sarcastic response. ""We are out of utensil and are waiting  to get some more clean"" at this  point  full  of anger and humiliation we requested  a manager who  to our Not  surprise was also  a young  kid. We explained all  we've been thru since  we arrived he apologize and offer  a discount  and  a free Brownie  for my niece  for all the inconvenience. they  replaced my sister in law dinner  and gave my nice a fresh  chicken nugget  dinner to go but  when  the bill  came back they  charged us  for both  chicken nugget meals they  charged  us for  the  brownie and  to top  it off they  never  brought the brownie to us. At this  point my sister in law  was furious called the manager  and gave  him  a piece  of her mind.  Need less to  say  we only paid for the  original meal order and for the Tip  well   you can imagine how  that one went  $0. We will never recommend dinner here to  any family that  wants  to have a pleasant day with their loved ones. We will never eat at this TGIF restaurant again and we will make sure as  a Pinecrest resident  every one local and not does the same spread the word and fight for our right as a customer to be treated  with  respect & dignity . Because the  majority of their clients in this  location are teenagers they probably don't care much about  the clients because kids  cannot give  the  kind of tips they  would expect to get. And because  its kids running the place  they  all  think  its a BK job  and treat everyone like crap but  that doesn't excuse  them. Everyone  should  be treated  like  a human being kid or not and behave  like one. So sad what  we have to go  thru  these days with the lack of morals and  education this new generation is growing up  to be. This is why  more and more restaurants are  closing down and loosing business for  lack  of cleannesless, professionalism and just plain lack of basic manners. Even the kids that frequent this place are being treated like SHIT only I don't think their bright enough to  know any better. Only god know what their being served and how when they  go to this  place.

49,mike p.,"Miami, FL",128,27,1.0,1.0,2016-08-15,"Disaster. STAY AWAY.  So many things went wrong with our visit that I almost don't know where to begin. The worst part was the terrible attitude of our server NICK and the indifference of the manager ""in training"". The ""manager"" was a bit more empathetic but still did not handle the situation properly.  1. We were originally a party of 5 plus a big double stroller with two babies. We needed a big table that was easily accessible. Then before being seated a friend came in and joined us so 6 plus stroller. Despite being empty the staff couldn't figure out where to seat us. They finally decided to send us to a big table atop TWO FLIGHTS of mini-stairs - the most inconvenient table in the place. . We had to carry the stroller up because apparently that's the only table to accommodate us even though it was almost empty! 2. It took the waiter 21 minutes to show up and that's AFTER I asked the hostess to please find our waiter. She found him and I watched as he basically was indifferent to the long wait. He strolled over to our table a while later looking like he was strolling through the park without a care in the world. I asked him to please take our order immediately because we had hungry kids and they needed to eat. I also asked him if he could bring something quickly for them. He said a basked of bread could be brought out right away. TWENTY MINUTES LATER the bread comes out! I asked him what's going on and he was clueless and indifferent/borderline rude. I asked for the food and he said ""most of it is ready"". I asked are the kids meals the ready ones he said YES. INSTEAD OF leaving them under the heat lamp bring them out! And the dishes that were they hold up? Cold sandwiches! Finally 50 minutes into our ordeal the food arrives.  3. The food was a disaster. We ordered for the adults 2 of the chicken clubs with avocado and gouda and it sounds great in the description. What arrived wasn't fit for animal consumption. The chicken was ICE COLD. The bread was like concrete. it had no cheese and the avocado was almost not present. The sandwiches were a mess.  4. I asked for the manager and the ""manager in training"" came out. I was obviously upset. His response? The waiter didn't put the order in on time. Its his fault"" Then he shrugged and said sorry as though he had no clue what to do. The waiter came back and I asked him what took so long. He said the kitchen screwed up. So one of them is lying or they are both clueless.  5. The ""manager in training"" then offers me 2 appetizer coupons and another shrug of the shoulders. I asked for the check, sent back the sandwiches. In the end I had to go find a bartender to actually accept payment because Nick the happy-go-lucky waiter was no where to be found. Zero tip for him. The manager then handed me the processed credit card slip to sign and had no clue why I had him run it. I explained the situation and he apologized, blaming the cook because ""he's new"".   Bottom line: the staff DOES NOT CARE about doing a good job. Some people can be retrained. Nick has the attitude that he is too good to be a waiter. You can't fix that and he should be dismissed. The manger in training communicates that he doesn't really want this job but maybe took it out of necessity and does not plan to excel. Not good either. The manager needs to monitor his staff more closely and do a better job of hiring. Food service is an important industry where reputation and quality are key to long term success.

But this Friday's deserves it. This isn't my first bad experience with the Friday's at The Falls. It's happened so many times that I feel I have to share it. This place needs to close. I'd rather starve than eat at this death trap. Every time a group of friends suggest Friday's I try everything to convince them not to go there. Most of the time it's been so long since they've been there and they don't believe how bad it's gotten until they experience it first hand. This is not the restaurant you remember going to when you were younger. The service is the worst in all of Miami. I've never been to a place that takes an hour and a half to get out an appetizer. You have to get up and flag your server down. The place is filthy. The food is disgusting. You're better off going to publix, buying frozen appetizers, and throwing them in your oven. It would be like a five star restaurant compared to the food at this Friday's. I got sick for two days after eating here. Our table all ordered bottomless appetizers and none of us were able to order more than one appetizer... So what's the point of bottomless?? We had to leave because we were going to be late to our movie and we arrived at Friday's with TWO hours of time to eat and pay. The best part is that the restaurant was empty. There's no reason why the food should have taken so long. Two hours to get out one round of appetiZers and the food? Everyone had to put their meal on Togo boxes and leave. On top of that they refused to sell one of our friends a drink because her ID was vertical. Friday's apparently has the right to refuse a drink to someone who holds a VALID, non expired, license and is of drinking age. Who is running this place??? Please fire them because they don't know how to run a successful restaurant. There isn't one good thing I can say about going to this Friday's. The food is horrible and overpriced.

My husbands soup was cold so we had to send it back. My small salad arrived without the dressing. When I asked the young man who brought me my salad for the dressing he simply ignored me and never came back. My daughters bruchetta chicken pasta was also lacking any flavor. I had a sandwich and again very bland. We will never be back . I wouldn't be surprised if this restaurant chain starts closing its doors.

23,Juan V.,"Goulds, FL",0,24,,3.0,2017-07-14,"We have been intermittent customers at this location for over 20 years.  It reminds those long gone days when my half orange and yours truly were dating. Like in any restaurant whether it is a chain or family owned, it's a matter of luck:  You showed one day and have a memorable dining experience; visit again next day and the experience is horrible, truly a nightmare. I must point out most of the time we have seated at the bar, having some draft beer and appetizers while my daughter and her friends are at the movies, so here are my comments: Pros 1-Extensive menu:  You can order a lot of different stuff. 2-Location:  It's conveniently located next to one of the main entrances into the mall. 3-Service:  maybe because we stayed at the bar, our service was generally speaking faster and without bumps, both for beverage and food. Cons 1-Service:  Twice we sat at the tables due to being with daughter and BFF, realized the service at restaurant not bar was remarkably slower.  Waiters were nice and polite, but slow. 2-Packed:  On Saturday or Sunday afternoon do not even attempt into get there, unless want to wait 1+ hours for a table. 3-Prices:  The food in my humble opinion is good, but with all honesty believe it is a little over priced; if you do not mind to drive further 20-30 minutes north, go to the Chilis at Kendall and you will find basically same kind of food at more reasonable prices, and if you love draft beer they have a long term 2-1 promotion. 4-Bathrooms:  Normally I do not care about bathrooms, but here I do an exception:  those are filthy.  There is toilet paper all over the floor and now and then seems as if a patron peed in the floor, really disgusting. After reading the zillions of 1 star comments from other folks here at Yelp, definitively I do believe my significant one and yours truly have been very lucky! I do not recall any bad experience like those other people mentioned here; Like I said you can visit the best restaurant in the world and if your waiter is in a bad day take for sure your dining experience will be ruined...But in other hand I do think it's impossible so many people can agree on bad comments concerning exactly the same issues (bad service, bad food quality, etc.). Please note I have never worked for TGI Friday's nor I do have any sort of interest there; I'm just giving my 2 cents opinion on this matter...  However there is a point I want to mention:  I traveled years ago to both New York and Buffalo, and by coincidence had to visit the TGI Friday restaurants at both cities and these were better managed and served than this location here in The Falls; furthermore the restaurant at my hotel in Buffalo was TGI Fridays and they had several promotions like Canadian beer 2-1(I know the border is nearby) and some others dinner specials which have never seen here in Miami...why? Bottom line, Chilis at Kendall is more closer to home, so for next visit probably will get there...Sometimes you should not listen to bad press, but I'm getting the opinion that things are going downhill at least with this particular TGIF location. P.D.  For those few people whom gave more than 1 star to their reviews and specially those which have visited the place for several years, do you know they used to have their own brand of beer? It was named TGIF and of course the label had the restaurant red/white logo on it...The taste was not bad, like those 'draft dry' beers en vogue during earlier and mid 90's...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=20,1.48,1.97,1.97,,1.774

2,Kim K.,"Miami, FL",121,40,47.0,1.0,2017-08-08,"Here with kids on a Saturday night around 9pm. SUPER busy. We were told 20 mins for a table, ended up waiting 40 mins. I have to say, as irritated as I was with the extra 20 mins (had the kids), the staff was excellent in demeanor and had an eagerness to please. The food did take forever to get, but once we got it, it was good. I say ""good"" because, after all, we are at a TGI Fridays. My steak was cooked perfectly (med-rare), my spinach was lightly sautéed (not mushy) and my mozzarella and tomato salad was really tasty. This was all a nice surprise considering this is not a steakhouse and the restaurant was obviously at capacity. I will say this, the restaurant could use a good scrubbing... to me this is lack of good management. The lack of management can also be seen in the inability to have enough staff available so the wait is either not so long OR the wait time given is correct.  Also, it seemed the servers were overloaded with tables, thus,our two-hour long dinner in what should have only been an hour, MAX! Go with the expectation of this being a family-friendly chain restaurant that is convenient and has value-priced meals rather than a 5 star dining experience and you won't be disappointed. Here again watching my waitress do everything but wait on our table all 1.5 hours I was here at an ""off hour"" and only 1 other table in her section. Took her 15 minutes to even greet us (after I had to go ask the hostess if we had a server), 10 mins to get our drinks and a painful 30 mins to bring us our food after she told she put a ""rush"" on it since we were sitting so long waiting for her.  I always order the same thing; the flat-iron steak, steamed spinach and tomato salad and must confess, it's pretty decent. If this place could just get some good management, it would make all the difference. The manager actually passed by me, nodded his head and told me to enjoy the meal. He didn't stop to ask me how things were. Truth be told, I wouldn't have said anything, as it's evident it doesn't matter based on all reviews from other yelpers. I come here out of convenience, price and my kids like it. Nothing more.  Oh... and never, ever when I'm in a hurry.  Was getting ready to post this with a 2 star. Changing it to one star. Took ANOTHER 10 minutes to get my server. I had to go ask someone to find her. Then another 15 mins to bring out my check once I told her I wanted the check. Honestly, the WORST service I've had in a very long time.
