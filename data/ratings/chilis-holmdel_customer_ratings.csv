I wasn't happy from the start but willing to give Chili's a try since i do like mexican. In the door - waiting for 5 minutes for a hostess. I tell my husband, ""let's leave"". He insists we stay. restaurant is not packed, bar is small, decor awful. We finally get noticed and seated after 7 minutes waiting. As we sit and i ponder the sticky menu, avoiding the crumbs on the table - 3 servers walk past u. we are sitting at the table for 5 minutes & the smell of the restaurant is nauseating me. I say, ""Can we please leave?"" Husband says, yes and bolts for door. We leave menu's on table. What a disappointment of a place but definitely not surprised.

We decided to go to Chili's for their ""infamous"" 2-for-$20 (the amount of commercials we were seeing had officilaly brainwashed us). What was surprising was the place was PACKED on Saturday night. We somehow managed to sneak in after only waiting 5 minutes (yes, we got a lot of glares moving through the waiting area). The 2-for-$20 menu was pretty extensive. There were a bunch of dinner entrees you could chose from, and a bunch of appetizers you can choose from. We split the guac/chips. I got the mango tilapia and my hubby got the baby back ribs. All were OK, nothing life changing. I probably should've gotten something a little fattier (mine was off the healthier option) like quesadillas. My husband said the ribs were a little dry.

It is that bad of infestation that they are in the waitresses clothing.  After she put the straws down we noticed and she just picked up the straw with the Roach still on it and walked it to the garbage. It didn't even bother her, like she was used to it.

9,Dan L.,"Brick, NJ",0,15,,1.0,2014-03-09,"Bad, bad, bad. This place is broken. Came in at 730 on 3/8/14, party of 6. Waitresses work in team duos creating confusion. One friendly who comes over often, but never with the correct items. The other stone faced who we see only when bringing incorrect items. So many mistakes it was laughable: 1st we're told its a 50 minute wait. Ok, it's Sat night and we're waiting for some of our party. Wait winds up being only 30 minutes..... Good start? Nah. We are seated where they have maneuverability to adjust tables for larger parties. This is done poorly with tons of wasted space. Not my problem, but a warning sign definitely. Also noticed the floor wasn't swept. Now for the highlights: Appetizer sampler served with incorrect items, and no app plates. Noticed there's no plates. Asked server. We didn't notice app items yet.  No plates come. Waitress comes over. We tell her about the wrong apps and no plates. She apologizes, says she'll be back with plates and replace apps. Replacements are quick, and the friendly waitress brings an extra plate of chips and salsa, trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together...... Still no plates. Dad's soup comes cold, sent back. Still no app plates. Told there are none?! They're being washed.  Dad's soup comes back. Still no plates????????? 10 minutes later app plates are here! 1 minute later entrees. Well most of the entrees. One is missing. Let waitress know, and ask for napkins.  Missing entree comes quick. No napkins. Ask again, they show up at some point. Mom's sides are wrong. Says it's futile to say anything. I agree. Bill comes. Over-charged, have to wait for correction. Wow, Chili's you set a record last night. I never saw so many mistakes in such a short amount of time. Whew. Also, one member of our party walked passed the kitchen and said it was a mess in there. ""Disaster"".

Tonight we stopped in and found a machine on the table which evidently has replaced most of what the server is supposed to do. The service was awful, appetizers were stale, food cold, no one checked on us after being served, couldn't get a glass of water and never had anyone offer to wrap up the leftovers. While paying the machine, a server did finally come over the ""show"" us how to leave a tip; the machine conveniently lands on 20%. We have always tipped well, for the sake of a few dollars we'd rather make a server's night. Tonight I would have left 10% if not for the server forcing the issue. Chili's, you've lost two customers.

I had the New Craft bacon cheeseburger at the Chili's in Holmdel NJ. Once again, it rocked! I ordered it medium rare, it came out medium (exactly how I like it). Good bacon, nice tomato, great brioche bun. That sort of thing. But the burger was fucking delicious. Goddamn it. Juicy and flavorful. It melted in my mouth, but had just the perfect amount of chew. A great combination of tender yet resilient. Once again, the fries were anemic and sparse, but for this burger, I would endure much worse than a few soggy potatoes. Burger aficionados must try this.

Ordered the special TNT burger featured in a large special menu. The food was incredibly late. The burger was so overcooked that I could have played 3 periods of hockey with it. It looked as though my 8year old put it together. How a restaurant that highlights burgers COMPLETELY miss on all levels is unforgivable.

1,Shaké K.,"Middletown, NJ",3,68,3.0,1.0,2015-09-13,"Our first visit a few months ago was ok except for all the chips we received with our appetizer and meals and when I say chips I don't mean tortilla chips, I'm talking about all of our dishes/bowls all having chips and cracks.  Our second visit was because someone in our party really wanted to go there. The food was never that good to begin with but as time passed, we've noticed a decline in the quality of food. This last time we went, it was only because we had a gift card and let me just say that it will be our last time. The service and food was ridiculous. I wanted to order the burrito with the prime rib but they were out. They were also out of the carnitas burrito and something else that the table next to us wanted to order (couldn't hear what they wanted, all I heard was that they were out). So I ordered a chicken burrito and she asked if I wanted sauce on it, I said no (the picture didn't show sauce on top). What does the waitress bring me? A burrito with sauce on top, then she proceeds to ask if it's ok that it has sauce on top...um really? You knowingly bring me the wrong item and push it on me?  Anyways, I know better than to send food back so i accepted it. I cut into it and what do I find? A filling that looked like a giant saucy, lukewarm, mess that didn't look anything close to the picture on the menu. I couldn't even tell if I was having chicken or pork. I wouldn't be surprised if it was someone else's incorrect order thay they melted cheese on and tried to pass off to the next person ordering a buritto. To top it off, my husbands burger had onions, which he asked for no onion and more than half the burger was so burned that he couldn't eat it. Add to it the fact that the waiter asked if we wanted our check before he asked if we wanted dessert and the fact that instead of bringing us our exact change of $13.50, they brought $13 (its not about the 50 cents, it's the principle of the matter), were pretty much done with this place. I think next time we'll hit up taco bell instead where they always get your order right and bring your food out nice and hot. It has been 5 hours since dinner and I'm still naucious from this meal.

Then I saw, it was cooked, so then I thought, oh, they're like McDonald's, they keep the food on a warmer.  But no, as I was eating it, it all came together.  The plate was someone else's, they either sent back our cancelled, it was sitting in the warmer for a while, and then rather than cook me a new one, they served me someone else's old food.  Gross.  The bartender did a great job elsewise, I would have gave a one star",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel?start=20,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

27,John D.,"Old Bridge Township, NJ",60,68,13.0,1.0,2016-05-08,"We've been to this Chili's twice now. Both times were comical.  The first time, it was super busy, so service was slow and awful. My burrito was missing the side sauce when it was brought out. No one was anywhere to be found to ask for some. When we finally found our server, she took forever to bring it out. The meal was inedible without it. I ate my food alone, as I didn't want my girl to wait and have her food get cold. This last time, 5/7/16, we both ordered smothered pork burritos and a guacamole/chips app. Service was fast. The guacamole was barely mixed. Many large chunks of avocado. Not bad, but hard to eat without mashing it ourselves. The burritos that came out looked bad. Plating was pretty poor. One burrito was torn open. The side of beans was mostly bean water with a few beans and a piece of tomato. One side had several chunks of jalapeño, while the other had none. The kicker was that both ""pork"" burritos contained shredded beef. We didn't mind, because they actually tasted good, but when we pointed out the error, the waiter insisted it was pork. We did find some pieces of actual pork toward the end of the burrito. It seems that whoever was in charge of shredding meat did not know the difference, and shredded a piece of steak into the shredded pork bin. Like I said, we weren't upset, because it was actually good! It is just comical that they would make the mistake, and insist it was correct. The server did not give half a shit. Of course, the paying kiosk had no paper for a receipt. Typical of Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

31,Dave C.,"Carteret, NJ",0,50,10.0,1.0,2017-03-06,One of the worst experiences in recent memory for the two of us. first of all it was a Monday night and the restaurant was practically empty. there were a few people at the bar but they seated the two of us in the one area of the restaurant where everyone else is. we asked to sit in a more quiet area and they did. we ordered and everything was fine. then a waiter behind us started dragging tables and chairs behind us making so much noise we couldn't even talk to each other. turns out they were setting up for a table of 8. we asked for our waiter so we could leave and then our food arrived. we were greeted by the manager who said there was no where else to put the party. we asked for to go containers so we could go home and eat in peace. he comped one of our meals even though the whole dining experience was ruined. I guess a party of 8 rates more than a party of 2. won't be returning any time soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
29,Ruth C.,"South Amboy, NJ",19,4,,4.0,2017-04-21,This is a very good place to eat.  The food was great and the service is excellent.  Our server Kim was great.  I saw bad reviews on yelp but they made a turn around.  Kim made an awesome guacamole at the table.  I will return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
25,maria r.,"Hazlet, NJ",9,166,325.0,3.0,2017-05-08,"Drinks were ok, but waiter spilled then a bit and didn't bother to clean up or give us coasters. We cleaned up after him. Food was ok but not much attention given to serving the plates, just quickly shoved towards you. Not the best service, shame cause this used to be a nice spot, once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
22,Melissa D.,"Matawan, NJ",399,501,699.0,3.0,2017-07-11,"My husband and I had dinner here on Friday night. It's located on Rt 35 in a shopping plaza next to Texas Roadhouse and with Marshalls/Homegoods, Five Below, etc.  The place was packed as expected on a Friday night, but we waited about 15-20 minutes to be seated. My husband had the Chicken Crispers with the Roasted Street Corn and French Fries and I had one of the Mexican bowls, Chicken. Our food was okay and service was also okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
24,Don B.,"Middletown, NJ",10,23,39.0,4.0,2017-08-18,Delicious meals at great prices.  Friendly staff that are willing to please. They assign two servers to each table to overlap assistance if needed. Grab a dessert too when visiting or a drink with your meal. No regrets to eating here on a regular basis.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
21,Amit P.,"Jerusalem, AR",131,18,16.0,4.0,2017-10-20,"My first time in a Chili's was a great experience.  Far better than their chain competitors. Service was excellent; staff hustled and the manager came by to check on us twice during our stay. I also like the move toward table top technology for some ordering and paying the bill. Good diverse menu. Our fajitas were very good, plenty of food. The presentation of the cheese, sour cream, etc was cumbersome and took up too much room at the table. Rice and beans could have been warmer, but overall a very good meal. Kids burgers were fine. Dessert of a lava cake dish was very large and tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
23,Pete R.,"Keyport, NJ",0,6,,1.0,2017-11-19,"Had Dinner tonight at this location and was very disappointed. I ordered the three chicken Taco combo w/black beans and rice. The chicken was awful. It was pulled finely and mashed with something that i could not identify. Nonetheless, the chicken was comparable to a chicken salad consistency.  It was so different then what I was expecting I found the consistency nauseating. Sadly disappointed. Most other places that serve chicken taco's fry small cut piece of chicken. If you should order this meal be aware that the chicken of salad consitency  and its taste is so different you too may wonder what you were served. Beware!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holmdel,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
20,Nicole C.,"Port Monmouth, Middletown, NJ",303,51,1.0,4.0,2017-12-23,The burgers were actually really good! They were juicy and tender always came with French fries that were crispy.
