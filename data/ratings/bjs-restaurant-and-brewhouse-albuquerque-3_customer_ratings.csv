77,Shelby W.,"Albuquerque, NM",9,12,,5.0,2015-04-18,"Great food, great beer, great atmosphere! This location has just opened, but it wasn't insanely busy as most new places are. We were told on a Friday night that our wait would be an hour, but were seated within 20 minutes. Very cool system that allows them to text you when your seat is ready.   Their deep dish is amazing, and the best I've found anywhere outside of Chicago, and I love that it's one of the few places I've found that has layered beer choices!

40,Jeff M.,"Rio Rancho, NM",9,118,94.0,4.0,2015-04-20,"Straight up - I avoid chain restaurants. Usually pretty awful... That being said, the new BJ's Brewhouse near Cottonwood mall is GREAT! The NY strip was killer! My son had the crispy jalapeño burger, and loved it! Home made root beer was AWESOME!  You HAVE TO order the cookie trio dessert - called pizukis??  Salted Carmel, cookies and cream and peanut butter cookie - TO DIE FOR!!! Service was stellar!!!  Ask for Gary or Cheyenne - they were really nice.  Had a great time.  Definitely a new favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=40,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416
61,EstMar M.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,23,4.0,4.0,2015-04-25,"So far so good. The place was packed and we got seated as soon as we walked in. Rene (I hope I spelled her name right) was really nice and gave us a lot of info about the place since it was our first time. As always we started off with our appetizer of calimari. We placed that order and not even 5 min later it was at our tabel. Perfectly cooked and crispy but not overly crispy. Has a good flavor and two dipping sauces.  We both had the roast beef dip, it came out pretty fast. However the presentation of the food was not pretty at all. It came with two sauces one au jus and other horse radish. The sandwich was not packed right all the meat was falling out from the middle because it was all packed there. Our fries were all in the horse radish. If you don't like horse radish then your kind of screwed. Food was good a bit on the pricey side. Overall it's a good choice just not to happy with my fries all up in the horse radish.

I don't know what standards they hold but the BJS in Cottenwood serves at best mediocre food. My kids Mac and Cheese? Kraft! ! The Black and Blue burger seemed burnt and doused in Salt. My pizza was a small began size and saposed to be for 3 people, with Raw dough in the middle. The tomato soupe was chunky and cold and bland. Campbell's condensed would have treated my taste buds better. And there Famous Wedge salade had blue cheese dressing and no crumbles of blue cheese as promised plus the bacon crumbles? After a bit of a search I found three. Disappointing all around the table. Thankfully our server saw our disappointment and comped the cold Kraft mac and cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=80,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
87,Robert J.,"Rio Rancho, NM",2,5,,4.0,2015-04-28,"My friend and I went to this restaurant on a rainy Monday evening. I knew nothing about the place and neither of us had dined here before. So my entire experience was all first impressions.  BJ's impresses when you first walk in. It's a very open and spacious bar look and it was pretty busy even for a rainy Monday. The first thing people may want to know about the place is that it isn't a romantic setting in any way. The ceiling is very high and it has a ""stadium"" like feel and there is a loud murmur from the crowd at all times. The only people you can hear are the people in front of you. If you're looking for a quiet dining, this isn't the place.  Our waiter was exceptional. He answered all our questions and was fast and courteous.  The first thing you will hear, (and will be a common theme) is ""hand crafted"". This buzzword is abused here. Hand crafted beer, soda, pizza, blah blah blah. Who cares? Does it taste good and is it a value? The brewed Beers are clearly listed on a giant blackboard so that there is no confusion. The ""hand crafted"" sodas are actually really nice as they add a great deal of variety from the common Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper (""Is Mr.Pib okay?) nonsense from every other restaurant... ever.    The food is where this place looses that fifth star. For what little I was exposed to on my first visit, it was delicious. My friend had a ""hand crafted"" pizza and I had a deep dish lasagna. We debated on the large selection appetizers. Ultimately we got a  pepperoni pizza dip that was creative and really tasty. But, the quality and the taste of the food was not the issue.  The price was.  Holy crap. $15- $17 for a personal size pizza? Really? I hate to be ""That guy"" but you can get a large specialty (everything) pizza at Dion's for $12.  Dion's is the freaking place to beat in New Mexico and every New Mexican knows it. Pizza places just need to realize and accept that. This may be a chain restaurant, but please do some research! There's literally a Dion's Pizza connected to the SAME PARKING LOT.   Aside from the pizzas, I perused the entire menu. There isn't a single adult entree under $13. When you realize what you are eating is pretty much glorified bar food, it puts that into perspective. It's hella tasty glorified bar food, but still glorified bar food.  One thing that I will mention, and this is either a positive or negative depending on your personal opinion; The menu is huge. When they hand it to you, you're like: ""Golly, that is a weighty tome!"".  All in all, I enjoyed my experience at BJ's and I have every intention of visiting again. I will be weary of the prices when I go in next time and I will probably get a steak if I'm gonna pay that much. The steaks looked pretty good. We'll see.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352

59,Ricky M.,"Gilbert, AZ",198,633,23.0,2.0,2015-05-06,I have been to each BJ's location in Albuquerque and both of them are really similar. The service is slow and the staff is rude. I showed up on a Sunday afternoon when it was somewhat busy went to the hostess to get seated and she just kind of stared at me without greeting me after giving me a blank stare for about 2 minutes asks how many are in my party and then just turns around and starts talking to her co-worker after feeling awkward since she didn't get my name or tell me how long it was going to be I just sat down and about 10 minutes later her coworker comes up to me and seats us at a dirty table so after the dirty table incident our waiter takes our order and about an hour later our food comes out. Sure the pizza here was good  and the avocado egg rolls are tasty but the service here is just horrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=40,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216
67,Jenn W.,"Rio Rancho, NM",44,366,76.0,3.0,2015-05-10,"I would honestly give this place 3.5 stars. We have been here twice - both times for a weekday lunch. Both times we were seated quickly and found the server to be efficient and friendly. The menu is massive - just about about anything you can imagine is served here...this might be why the kitchen is a little slow, not super slow...but expect lunch to take a full hour (even though we have been ready order to quickly). The food is solid chain-type food and has always been cooked correctly. It is easy to take the kids here because the environment is a little loud and distracting. I really appreciate that servers (other than the one assigned to your table) will run the food out, stop and check on you and refill drinks. This level of teamwork makes all of the difference for the customer. We will keep coming back when we are in the area and want a restaurant with a lot of variety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=80,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

Well, this was no exception.  Our waitress was nice & efficient.  The food came. I ordered the bison burger -- medium. It came well done. My table mate ordered medium well but with sauce on the side.

Service is bumpy, and the food runners are still learning tables so you get them coming by with food and not knowing where to takeit so they tend to just ask every table down the row. I been there, I have done the restaurant biz before. I feel bad for giving only 3 stars, as I know once they get runing right It's going to be a great place.

Service was fairly good for our waitress being overworked. Food came out on time and was just as we have come to expect, good.  I was impressed that all BJs new locations import waiters from out of state to help train the new staff.  We had a guy who was from California that he been there for couple weeks training others.  So that right there tells me this place puts a lot into making sure all locations are keeping up there great service.   So like I said, this place is good as all other BJs we've been too and will definitely be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=60,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48

We ordered our drinks and upon getting them I cheered my Dads beer and my glass bottom completely broke off and the beer and glass went every where.

No, just pick that hair out and I'll dig right in!  What the heck did she think?!  When the 'fresh salad came out, the plate had a large chip in the edge...quality control anyone?  My burger was ""charred"" not 'flame broiled' but I was hungry so choked down about half.  Our friend's salmon salad lacked salmon.  The server brought it five minutes after the meal was served and it had clearly been microwaved too long, crusty and dry.  Saw the manager grab-assing with the waitresses but never once saw him approach ANY table to engage with customers.  At the end of the meal we asked to see the manager but after 15 minutes waiting decided to bag it and leave.  The hostess told us ""Quite a few tables have asked to see him so he's busy making the rounds""  Of course in the hour we sat there, he never 'made a round' and I could see the entire restaurant.  Haven't had this kind of problem before so was pretty surprised and embarrassed that this happened in front of our out of town guests.  Learned my lesson though.  No more chances for BJ's.  Too bad because I like the beer and the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=100,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

The staff at this restaurant are very friendly, prompt, and helpful. We have never had any problems with service. The food is good. I have tried the Mediterranean tacos (which you may like if you enjoy Greek yogurt), the veggie and goat cheese flatbread pizza (very delicious), and the ahi tuna salad (tasty but has some wasabi-zing to it).  As for drinks, I have really been enjoying their Temple of Stone IPA lately, and let me tell you- I am not one to like hoppy beers. This beer is an IPA for the weak. ;) I can enjoy it down the last sip. My boyfriend also has been ordering it lately, and can drink IPAs like no other.

98,Robert P.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",56,100,22.0,3.0,2015-10-30,"I have two very conflicting experiences here. One I would rate a 1-star, and the other I would rate a 5-star. Both experiences were with the same two people, at 10pm at night (after we got off work). Let's start with the 5. 5-stars:  The three of us sat at the bar and received great service. The bartender was extremely social and tended to our every need. He was on top of everything, recommended us great drinks, and joked around with us. The food came out great, albeit a tad slow, but it was a fine experience non-the-less.  For the one-star: We were sat down at a table this time by Amber (I believe, says she has a husband that works in the kitchen). She smelled like cigarettes, must have been after a break. She was alright in the beginning, served us our drinks and took our order fine. Now the kitchen was slow as heck this night, I don't know why. There weren't that many tables, either that or we all ordered at the same time. The food that came out was good though, no complaints on that. Where it fell apart was our waters were empty, and I was waiting to order another drink. When she came around we ordered drinks and ordered pizookies. We ordered the pizookies at around 10:50, and we didn't receive them until around 11:30. The worst part was, after we ordered our pizookies, without even receiving them yet, she brought us out our check. Dessert wasn't even ready, and you brought out our check? Not to mention we paid at 11:15, and she kept reassuring us that the pizookies would be out soon. At 11:20 she said, ""Don't worry I have a girl in the back that's going to bang them out in 2 minutes!"". Still, nothing until 11:30. To give us the kicker she gave us a coupon for $5 off $25 our next meal. What the f? Honestly, just an overall bad experience and no manager to be found.

It took about 30 minutes for a soup and a sandwich.  When they finally came out, they brought my husband a BBQ platter not a sandwich and my bowl of soup was about a half of cup!  We didn't care at this point to say anything, we were so hungry. The bill was messed up twice, the server assumed that my husband was the only military person, eventhough, we clearly stated we both were.  I showed him my paperwork and he was able to fix it.  This process took 30 minutes since requesting the check.

The snobby hostess should have been our first warning that the place was going to be a disappointment. I guess she believes that smiling will give her crow's feet, so she opts for the stick-up-her-ass look instead. The guy who sat us shared her same demeanor. Our server was pleasant, although, he was very forgetful numerous times.  The food was equally disappointing. Our friends ordered spaghetti for their three-year-old, and it came drenched with basil. Who the heck decided that putting tiny pieces of herbs in a kid's dish would be a good idea? So, our poor friend was picking them out one by one. Veggies or herbs should not be included in a kid's dish. I'm pretty sure the veggies on my vegetarian pizza were rancid. It smelled and tasted off. I ate anyway because I was starving, but I kept picking things off because it just tasted funky. I just warmed up my leftovers, and took about two bites and threw the rest away because I couldn't stomach it.  So, overall, this place was not what I was hoping it would be.

Last week I went for my birthday dinner with a large group. One person in my party did not receive his food so the waiter offered a soup while he waited for his meal.. nice gesture-all is forgiven. When his meal came out it was not correct so the waiter had to correct the kitchen's mistake. We figured that was just due to us having a large party so we didn't mind it too much.  The time comes to collect our ticket. This is where mass confusion hits.. another table's entire ticket was on our tab. You would imagine this would take maybe 10 minutes to sort out- boy was I wrong. 45 minutes later I still had not received my dessert I ordered, the manager couldn't figure out how to fix the multiple mistakes on our tab, and we hadn't received refills on our drinks. When all was sorted out we received a discount on our entire ticket. My biggest complaint is that BJs has moved to a paperless program. The waiter was unable to fix his original mistake of accidentally placing another tables order on our ticket due to the program. The next complaint I have is that we made reservations a day in advance but they still gave us only one waiter who happened to have the least experience with large parties.

I ordered the Southern Comfort which is the chicken sandwich of all chicken sandwiches! Crispy, juicy, fried chicken breast, bacon, ham and Swiss cheese! No veggies needed for this bad boy! Delicious! My boyfriend ordered the two bone pork chop and MY GOODNESS! IT WAS HUGE! It takes a while to cook this monster but well worth the wait. It was so tender and so juicy and seasoned perfectly. For dessert we got the beignet. This was the true test since we are both lovers of the Cajun cuisine. It was a nice light take on a beignet.

This brings me to another review for the delivery service GRUB HUB. See you there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3,3.0,3.1,3.1,,3.0600000000000005
23,Robbie S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-17,"Bad Service, Just OK food, I ate at BJ's last night --What a Mess, the server got my order wrong -My corrected order was recieved  after everyone else had finished--So they ordered a dessert and the order was received 20 minutes later. The best is we had two servers - one was a trainee and while the training server was taking our orders the trainer--was texting on her phone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3?start=20,2.84,3.08,3.08,,2.9840000000000004
14,Stephany N.,"Placitas, NM",35,11,3.0,4.0,2017-10-22,"This place is pretty cool, has a laid back atmosphere. The beer is served in super chilled glasses, which is pretty cool and not bad prices for a pretty large mug. Burgers are great and so are the pizzas if you have someone to share with. Large variety menu and a full bar. Good place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3,2.92,3.07,3.07,,3.01
18,Corina D.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,2017-11-03,"I use to love this place.   I don't know what happened, but the last 3 visits where undesirable. I am patient when it comes to the food industry. I always give them more than one chance at a bad experience before I decide not to do business with them. I figure maybe server had a bad day, maybe they were short staffed......  These were my last experience on three separate occasions  1. They did not acknowledge us for at least 15 minutes after we were seated.  It wasn't until my husband got up and asked the hostess if our server was aware that we were there. Our food traveled at snail pace and we had to wait 20 minutes to get our check. 2. This time they brought me the wrong plate and by the time I got the right plate my husband was done with his dinner.  Since I figured it would take a while before I got my food. My husband and I shared his dinner. When my dinner finally came around, we asked for a box. 3. Last and final time. We had out of town coworkers that we invited to dinner. Our server got our drinks wrong and Once our server brought us our food, he never checked on us again. We had to ask the other servers for extra napkins, water, flatware.  He did finally show up, but only to drop and collect the check.   It's too bad, I really wanted to love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3,2.84,3.04,3.04,,2.9600000000000004
4,Bruce H.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,28,,4.0,2017-12-21,"Really good food at a reasonable price. I had the quinoa shrimp and it was fabulous. Lots of shrimp and tasty quinoa, arugula and tomato in a light garlic sauce. My companion had spaghetti and meatballs (something I would not have thought to order here) and she said it was very good, although way too much for one sitting. (She took at least half home.) They also have a very good selection of craft beers on tap at very reasonable prices. I had the Lightswitch Lager - excellent. The waiter was attentive but not intrusive. I hadn't been here in quite a while and I had forgotten how good it is. Now I'd like to return again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-albuquerque-3,2.96,3.04,3.04,,3.0080000000000005
2,Adam B.,"Albuquerque, NM",9,69,8.0,3.0,2018-01-05,This place is hit and miss.

3,Trish R.,"Albuquerque, NM",33,4,1.0,2.0,2018-01-06,While I enjoyed the environment & servers I can't say the same for the food. I've been there twice & both times received under cooked (raw) chicken.
