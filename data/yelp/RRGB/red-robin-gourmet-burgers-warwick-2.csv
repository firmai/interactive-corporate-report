Fran F.,"New Bedford, MA",1,23,11,1.0,11/14/2016,I would like to add the beverage manager ended up comping the entire bill.  I left the bill amount on the table for the waitress.  I was not looking for a free ride by complaining.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=40

To me, it's not a big deal, but, it was a little surprising. Everything else, I had no complaints.

Mitch K.,"Seekonk, MA",36,561,63,2.0,1/1/2014,"You would think that a place known for burgers would beat Five Guys, or at least equal it. Nope, sorry, Red Robin isn't even close. The waiter was pleasant but his upsell tactics wore thin by the end of the meal. Me: ""I'd like a raspberry ice tea please."" Server: ""Sure, you said a Long Island Ice Tea, right?"" Me: ""Sigh, no a regular one."" Our first mistake was the chips and french onion dip appetizer for $3. It was worth no more than $3 as it consisted of a plate of (I guess) fresh made chips and a weird cold ranch-y onion dip. Disappointing. My blue cheese burger was cooked ok but it was lukewarm, there were very little blue cheese crumbles on it, and overall it was just a very bland burger. Another disappointment. You also only get a little cup of steak fries. Sure, the fries are ""bottomless"" as they say, but who the heck wants to wait for more fries? Just give a good amount to begin with. Needless to say, we'll never go back as I don't appreciate being badgered to pay more $$$ for liquor, dessert, etc. and the burger was very underwhelming. Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=40

Kate W.,"Wakefield, RI",55,159,13,3.0,4/19/2014,"I have only been to a Red Robin once before (in PA), and I should start by saying  not a huge fan of chain restaurants. But, we were on the go and needed something fast, and we were starving/craving burgers.  If I didn't have the prior visit to a different location to compare this to, I would have assumed all Red Robins were like this experience. Unfortunately, everything was super greasy and oily. The burger and bun were literally soaked in oil/grease and would drip when being lifted off the plate. My husband had the guacamole burger and he said it was not as greasy as mine and much tastier. So different from the past experience. Also, at the other location, we received bottomless fries as soon as we sat down. Here we had to ask for them, and she still didn't bring them out until our whole meal came out (keep in mind we were starving;) Maybe it was just an off cook/day for them? Also, as a side note, there was a manager meeting at the table next to ours and we could hear the whole meeting. It was awkward because an employee was being reprimanded and it became a little loud at some points.  Overall, not horrible, just not as good as the other location we went to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=40

Our waiter took our drink order and explained the deal. My husband enjoyed the  double burger with french fries. My garden burger was tasty but the sauce, a country dijon, was very spicy. the attentive manager who was visiting tables brought me a new roll and I chose ciabatta instead of wheat.  that was an improvement.  My mistake was that I had the bagged shredded lettuce on it rather than fresh romaine.  I chose broccoli as my side and it was very plain so i requested olive oil to give it some flavor.   Lots of good choices and adjustments on the menu of which I was unaware - next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=40
Brianna B.,"Warwick, RI",0,1,,1.0,8/1/2016,"Went to red robin on a Saturday night and was surprised at how empty it was- until we experienced the service.  My first complaint was that the floors were REALLY slippery, and mentioned it to the hostess who basically agreed with me. Then after browsing the menu, we ordered some drinks. For a place with only 5 tables, we expected quick service but that was not the case. After finally ordering and another long wait, we received our food-yay? Too bad the pineapple wasn't grilled and the bacon was cold on my friend's undercooked burgers. I ordered some doughnuts, as I just wanted dessert. They were out of berry dipping sauce, and my server told me someone was making more. It tasted like jelly mixed with water, and it was far from appetizing. After clearing the plates, our server never came back, and we paid on the kiosk at the table and left cash because she never came to collect it.

Bethany S.,"Warwick, RI",251,154,43,1.0,2/25/2014,"I've been here twice, and both times were much less than enjoyable.  Now, I know, it's a chain restaurant, but the service and the level of food was subpar at best.  Our waiter had no clue what he was doing.  We had a larger party, which again, I know can be difficult, but it took over half an hour for us to get our drinks and even longer than that for him to actually take our food order.  My hopes were not high for the quality of this meal, but little did I know, they would be dashed even worse than expected.  When I recieved my grilled bruchetta sandwich, it was quite obvious that it had been sitting around while the rest of the orders were completed.  The bottom bun of the sandwich whats soggy to the point that it fell apart the minute I picked it up.  I informed the waiter of this fact to which I recieved a blank stare.  I had to ask him to bring me another sandwhich to which I did not even hear a muttering of apology.  10 awkward minutes later spent watching everyone else eat their meals, they brought me another sandwhich, which prompltly also fell apart and I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork.  All in all the meal took over 2 hours, which in the setting of a birthday dinner was fine, but had we been planning on having timely meal, we would have been furious. All of this being said, the manager did come and apologize for my meal and was very friendly and nice.  It almost seemed as if he was subconciously apologizing for the embarrasment of his staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=40

Alex B.,"Providence, RI",13,86,33,3.0,9/16/2014,"The wife wrapped up work early today and wanted to go out to lunch with the baby and I. She also wanted to stop by the Rhode Island Mall. We decided to grab a burger at Red Robin. The last time we at Red Robin was in Arizona.  We arrived around 2 pmish, the place was dead (It must get busier for dinner). It took us about 2 minutes to be seated. Our waiter Chuck was Great. He was very friendly and very accommodating.  We ordered onion rings for appetizers they were delicious, wife ordered a burger and I ordered a bacon burger with bacon. While looking at the menu, I noticed they sell those cool glass cups, I ask chuck if I can buy a few for the house? How much are they? Chuck replies "" $ 3 or $ 4 let me ask my manager. Chuck comes back states they dont have those glasses in stock, they have the coors light cans. I ask him to show them to me. He does, I say what the heck their $4 bucks let me buy a couple. The manager comes over, I ask him why no glasses he says "" well we really dont carry them???? Hmmm then why you trying to sell them on your menu???  Not a big deal! Thats one of the reasons I got out of retail, good help is hard to find! So Im trying to keep my 3 month old son occupied, the burgers show up. Im eating while taking care of the baby. My wife says hows the bacon burger, now mind you i am half way done. Im like BACON what BACON???? She replies you ordered a bacon cheeseburger didn't you??? So I lift the bun, I look and guess what NO BACON!!! So I ask Chuck did I order a Bacon Cheesburger he says yeah. I lift the top of the burger wheres the BACON??? Again here comes the Manager, I know what he was thinking half the burger is gone this guys trying to pull a fast one. Manager says do you want BACON, I say no its ok not a big deal, he says well I will only charge you for a Cheesburger.  So after getting home and jumping on my laptop, I am thinking. The place maybe had 10 customers in the entire place. How did your staff forget the BACON????

Meaghan M.,"Pepperell, MA",2,9,,3.0,11/3/2015,"I'd love to give a higher rating, but our visit last night was a letdown. We have come to this location for about 10 months, about once or twice a month. This was our second visit this week with family (who we had to persuade to go since during our visit a few days ago it had taken 48 minutes to get our entrees even after we were seated in the booth). The waitress tried to keep on top of the negatives, but it was kind of hard. Last night, our drinks (soda) took a while due to both machines needing some sort of filter maintenance, then our appetizer never came. Our waitress was very busy the whole time, so our first opportunity to talk to her came when she brought out our entrees. She checked and someone in the back had forgotten to make the appetizer, and it was just being started and would not be ready in time for us to eat it before our meals got cold. We asked for it to be boxed, which it was; the item was missing its sauce, which we found out after we had left. I asked for a refill on our drinks, and it never came. At that point, we just paid using the kiosk box on the table and left. Food was excellent, service is slipping. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=60
Dave L.,"South Kingstown, RI",53,240,49,2.0,11/22/2011,"We went here the other night with our two teens. The restaurant is nice enough - seemed clean, I liked the stuff they had and there's a full bar. Our waitress was very good, which is unusual these days. All four of us ordered burgers, no special orders, straightforward.  We waited about 40 minutes for our burgers to arrive, which for a Monday night is inexcusable. Burgers don't take that long, especially when there's barely anyone in the joint.  My burger was fair. The meat was ok I suppose, but for nearly $10 I expected a substantially sized patty. It was lost in the bun and toppings. My wife's burger was ok too, nothing special. The boys, they're teens so they'll eat pretty much anything put in front of them. They seemed happy enough. To be brief - these burgers were not nearly as delicious as Five Guys, twice as expensive as Five Guys, and took far too long to get to the table. On the plus side, Red Robin has beer. This was too expensive for just an ok burger. Not a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=60

Melanie M.,"Warwick, RI",11,13,,4.0,6/26/2014,"So, we received a message from a manager to discuss our concerns by phone, after which we were asked to come back and try the restaurant again. She seemed genuinely concerned and wanted to know whether similar things had happened there more than once.  She offered us a gift card to give them another try, so we figured it couldn't hurt.  It came in the mail the following week and we tucked it away for an opportune moment (they're more rare these days with a toddler and an infant, which is why it took us nearly 2 months to make it back).  We were also supposed to let the manager we'd spoken with know when we arrived, but she wasn't on at the time (sorry, Sarah, we did try!). In any case, things went much better this time.  The food was hot and delicious, the waiter was friendly and attentive, and when the fries took longer than anticipated coming from the kitchen he popped by to let us know that they were on the way and he hadn't forgotten them.  Really, that's all it takes to keep us happy.  We don't abuse our wait staff and don't ask for much- we had one refill each on beverages and fries.  Even if we hadn't had the gift card, we would have left much more satisfied this time, and chafed less at the price, since we really felt like we got our money's worth this time. So, amended rating- five stars for this visit, averaged with 2 from the last review, makes 3.5 (rounded up to 4 since that's convention).  I hope they're able to maintain consistency in service in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=60

We only ordered guacamole and chips yet it took over 25 minutes to come out, then our meals came less then 5 minutes after that...the couple next to us got their meal before their app came out.

Serge H.,"Providence, RI",0,30,,2.0,6/4/2016,"Red Robin creates quite an illusion in their advertisements. What appears to be big, hearty pub style burgers in their slick commercials, ended up having more in common with chains like SONIC. The Pig Out Style bacon burger I ordered was somewhat small, and average. Nothing to write home about there.  The endless fries gimmick was quite a disappointment too. I'd rather have one decent batch of fries, than get a scant 10 French fries, and then, wonder when I might catch the wait staff's attention to bring me another dose. I did ask for a second helping, and they eventually arrived. Of course, by that point I was long since done with my meal, and ready to pay the bill.   In summation, the food isn't terrible, more akin to a middling fast food burger joint.  Essentially you are paying more for the ambience of the restaurant chain, than a great burger. If I'm going to do that, I'd probably go with a place like JOHNNY ROCKETS, and be much more satisfied with the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20
Andy L.,"Barrington, RI",0,7,,1.0,6/11/2017,Bad service and poor food quality.  Soda had no carbonation.  No menu that summarizes toppings and waitstaff screwed up order and brought wrong order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20
Nicole R.,"Providence, RI",28,334,118,2.0,6/12/2015,"The hostess was pretty terrible and made it seem as if we were troubling her with our existence. We were then brought to the table where we met our waitress who was less than welcoming. About 10-15 mins later we ordered our dinner and appetizer. It took quite a while for the food to come out and then they brought us the wrong order. When i was able to flag someone down to let them know about the mix up the waitress inspected the burger, brought it to the back and then came back with the same burger about 10 mins later and said: ""The order was right and this is what you ordered."" She then proceeded to plop down the food (which was most definitely NOT what i ordered) and walked away. I didn't see her again until the check came and was plopped down in a similar fashion to the burger which i didn't end up eating. No checking on drinks, no fry refills, nothing.  Awful. 2 stars for the onion ring tower, and the onion ring tower alone. If you're torturing yourself by going here at least do yourself a favor and go for the rings. Only thing which didn't disappoint during our visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20
Cuitlahuac G.,"Woonsocket, RI",1,25,,1.0,3/19/2017,"This was our first time at Red Robin, and I wasn't impressed and will never go back. The burgers are ok, what do you expect from a chain. They are over priced for no reason, the endless fries are a joke. The unlimited refills on drinks is a joke. The service in this location is horrible, and I know it because I watched people get up and go look for food and drinks so it wasn't only my experience. I received 6 fries with my burger, 6. I ordered lemonade with my drink and I got a cup of ice with some lemonade. I asked for a order of fries and a refill of my drink and the waitress went to go clean the booths that were already clean and walk around. At the time we had about 4 empty booths around us and that's what everyone was concerned about. About 10 minutes after I was done eating 7 fries and a drink magically appeared and we just wanted to leave. At several points of the evening all of the waiters and waitresses just disappeared somewhere. That's when several tables went looking for food. We received our food before other tables that had already been sitting for a while. So I wasn't impressed at all I will stick with my usual spots for burgers, I can get better quality for a third of the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20
Josh C.,"Johnston, RI",3,13,1,1.0,8/1/2016,"A short preface by saying I have worked food service before so I tend to be more lenient when it comes to restaurants. Tonight's service is definitely up there with poor quality. I've been to this location before and it wasn't nearly as bad as it was tonight. We got there about 7:07p and, for a Monday, waited about ten minutes before being seated in the bar area. I had ordered the red sangria, I generally will only get one drink if I go out for dinner but when this arrived it tasted like watered down red wine. Long story short on the sangria the waitress informed me that it was box sangria. As I mentioned ""when"" the waitress came over to take our order was twenty minutes after we got there.    Despite my best attempts I try not to be terribly picky, especially when something is on the menu, my wife ordered a ""Pig out Tavern Double"" burger with cheddar cheese and fries and myself had requested a ""Southern Charm"" burger in a lettuce wrap with sweet potato fries. Halfway through the wait on our meal, the wait was about another twenty minutes, the waitress came over to inform me that they ran out of lettuce for the lettuce wrap.... yes... they ran out of lettuce. So I told her she could just put it on a plate and that would be fine.   All the while my wife and I are sitting there waiting and our waitress and the other servers are texting, cleaning up for the night it seemed and overall not checking in with us for any reason. By the time our food arrived we had cold fries, and a burger with some iceburg lettuce stacked on top and bottom, where my wife's meal looked like something we could have ordered from McDonald's and it had American cheese that looked like someone just opened up a few slices of Kraft singles. This is far from what I would justify to anyone as a ""gourmet"" burger being part of their slogan.   Around 7:58 our plates had been empty for a while, and yet the waitstaff just keeps walking by us, there are three of them now and not a single one looked over or said anything as small as "" let me get those out of the way for you"". Eight o'clock rolls around and still nothing, finally our waitress comes over to see if we would like a refill on the fries, so we indulge and say sure. Another ten minutes later fries arrive, also cold to luke warm and covered in oil. I could not get out of there fast enough. We paid and picked up to leave. The real kick was on our way out, the hostess was looking down at her phone the whole time and never said anything as simple as ""Have a good night"" or ""Thanks for coming"".  All in all, a ""gourmet"" dinner for two took over an hour and a half to ""enjoy"" with some of the worst service I've had in a long time. I would have bet there were no more than twenty or so customers inside at any given point during my ordeal.  Advice: Go to Long horn right next door, may be a little more expensive but the quality and service is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20
Amanda P.,"Providence, RI",0,10,,2.0,3/7/2017,"Just got home from the Warwick, RI Red Robin location. Walked in and as we were being seated I almost fell down because the floor was so slippery. I'm not sure if the floor was wet or just washed, but there were no wet floor signs so I'm assuming that the cleaning products used just made the floor slippery. I ended up pulling a muscle in my back and in my arm from trying to catch my fall. The hostess asked me if I was okay right after, I replied yes because I was pretty much embarrassed that I was falling in the first place. When I sat down, is when I felt the discomfort in my back and arm from the potential fall. The waitress came over (which I'm sure she saw my fall because she was in the kitchen, which we were seated near) and didn't ask me if I was okay, she just wanted to take me and my friends order immediately. I could tell she was a little annoyed. We had no idea the kitchen closed at 10 pm we walked in at 9:05 pm, we also asked the hostess prior to being seated if we were too late to come in because we could have gone somewhere else that was open close-by. ANYWAY, I wanted to order a vegetarian/vegan burger, but didn't see anything listed on the menu because I felt so rushed (and the menu's design is super confusing and clustered). So I had to go with a salad and fries. I am lactose intolerant so when I received my order I saw cheese on the garlic fries I was a little surprised (again because I felt rushed and didn't read the menu thoroughly), and also found 2 pieces of mac and cheese in my HOUSE SALAD. I pushed the shredded cheese off of my fries, but I wasn't totally positive all of the cheese was off. I didn't want to make a big stink because my friend and I wanted to get out of there and as I said earlier the waitress was annoyed. Towards the second half of our experience the waitress was nicer than she was (most likely because a family of 3 came in at 9:43 pm and she didn't have a reason to be annoyed with us anymore). Moreover, I'm glad I have a couple of Lactaid pills at home so I don't feel sick tonight, and a heating pad/ice.  Sorry for the bad review, but I had to be honest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20
Robert F.,"Lincoln, RI",27,8,,1.0,2/14/2016,"I would choose zero stars if that were an option.  We went to the location next to the Warwick Mall complex and it was one of the most disappointing dining experiences that we have ever had the displeasure of enduring.  It took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive, even though it wasn't busy.  Really?  Forty-five minutes for burgers and fries?   The other negative aspect of our visit is that I went out of my way to specifically ask for a PLAIN cheeseburger with just bacon on it.  Forty-five minutes later, my meal arrived and when I bit into it, there were mushrooms, which I am very allergic to.   When I brought this to the attention of our server, she aggressively tried to place the onus on us by maintaining that my sister-in-law must have taken my order by mistake.  My sister-in-law had, in fact, ordered a mushroom cheeseburger and that was what she got.  To summarize, even though only one cheeseburger with mushrooms was ordered, two of them were delivered to our table.  So either this overly contentious waitress messed up the order, or the kitchen did.   Also, not once during this interaction did the waitress ask how I was or express any concern that a customer had been erroneously served a meal with ingredients that he/she was allergic to.  Fortunately, there were no ill effects, but this should not be the attitude and reaction when something like this occurs. Furthermore, arguing with customers, especially when you are in the wrong, is not only bad form, but it is also bad business.  To her credit, once the waitress realized that a mistake had been made, she said a corrected order would be expedited within a ""few"" minutes, but it took another 25 minutes.  Apparently, in Red Robin world, it normally takes 45 minutes to cook a hamburger, but in a pinch, they can expedite it in only 25 minutes. Lastly, they did not even have the business acumen and/or public relations sense to take the offending burger off our bill.  Perhaps I should have pressed the issue, but by that point, I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could, rather than prolonging the agony. I blame most of this on poor management.  We will not be returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20
Altena L.,"Warwick, RI",257,162,456,3.0,2/17/2015,"This place is usually okay with decent service. I really like their wings and enjoy their burgers. But from experience, I'd rather sit in the bar area, where there are less errors! This was our first time in the dining room. During my most recent visit my server was new and was polite.  However, it took 3 tries to get an actual seltzer for my boyfriend (she always brought over different ones - first time it was tonic). When I advised that tonic was different she explained she didn't know the difference.  Then, I asked if they had the wings with the bone-in, not boneless. She explained they only have boneless. I then pointed out wings and chips and asked what the difference was. She explained that there wasn't any. Then I questioned her on that it seemed different...and she advised that she was mistaken and they do have the wings with the bone-in but you only get 4 of them. My boyfriend really wanted to get them so I did so.  She only charged us $5, meaning we could had done the actual one that I requested for $9 and probably would had more wings.   She also questioned me when I told her it was my birthday and she pretty much doubted me. She explained it would had automatically popped up in the system if it was my birthday. I advised her with the email and my birthdate. She also had to get her manager to figure it out. Her manager advised I was unable to get a free black angus order and just took off the most she could on a burger. I advised that it was okay. Our waitress never apologized nor wished me a happy birthday. She was argumentative when it came to the wings.  The service there was very slow and it was a Sunday and quiet. We waited over an hour and a half for just our food to come and never any updates besides one; because of the burger you ordered it takes longer. There were never any updates. A request for another seltzer took at least a half hour for one seltzer.   Also, when the wings came I requested blue cheese - which never ever came. This place can certainly improve as I know they have some new employees. Every table served I heard the manager apologizing for a number of errors from their wait staff. Hopefully, their place and service will be faster and better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20
Jake H.,"West Warwick, RI",54,4,,1.0,11/13/2015,"I was very disappointed in my meal. I ordered the ""clucks"" (chicken fingers) in ""buzz sauce"" (buffalo) with Mac n cheese.  Problems:  1)There was basically no ""buzz sauce"" involved at all. The ""clucks"" were dry and had no appreciable ""buzz"" flavor whatsoever.  2) There were only 4 ""clucks"" and one was a runt of the ""cluck"" litter and was only one bite's worth of food. 3)While the Mac n cheese was good, they gave me about a spoonful and half of it.  4) All of the above would have been annoying but tolerable had this been a $7 appetizer but as a ~$12 entree it was a terrible value.  I typically enjoy RR but do yourself a favor and stick to the burger menu.

Rob B.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,2.0,9/20/2015,"After trying other Red Robin locations before, we were expecting at least a halfway decent experience at this one.  Were we wrong. Everything was a bad experience and ultimately a waste of my time and money. The menu looks great, but the food that actually got delivered and the quality of service of those waiting on us was horrible.  First, we were seated in the bar area and our waitresses were the team of bartenders, so they were already in a position of disadvantage having two areas to tend to, but that was no excuse for the piss-poor service. Both waitresses conveyed an attitude that we were interrupting their day by being seated away from the bar. They rushed us through our order and missed a couple things in the process.  The beverages came out with foodstuff stuck to the straws as if someone bussed a table and then made my drink. When we asked for a new one, that's where things really turned: we were completely ignored for the rest of the time. Every table around us was checked on but once we raised a concern we were blacklisted.  When the food came out it was well over cooked, sloppy in presentation and took forever. We actually debated walking out a few moments before it arrived. When we got it, it was incorrect and missing anything we added - but they were sure to put it on the check! We stared at the culinary embarrassment placed in front of us for about twenty minutes before the manager (Dave) finally came over. To his credit, he did take off the items and apologized, but my experience has been so poor that it has influenced me to avoid the chain all together.  In summary, the menu looked good but the food was mediocre at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20

I sent that back and got soggy fries as a trade. I was also disappointed that neither myself or my daughter got offered a refill on our drinks or sides, since we are supposed to get free refills. In previous visits, the refills would arrive without being asked. I noticed the table next to ours received their apps after their main course arrived, and i could tell they had waited quite a while as well.

Mary K.,"North Providence, RI",53,184,457,3.0,8/17/2016,"Needed something quick while in the area shopping. Came here b/c it was convenient - located in the Warwick Mall shopping plaza. The hostess warned us the floors were slippery - according to other reviews, this seems to be a problem (when we left they were still slippery/sticky). Got seated right away but took our server a little while to finally come over - we were in a rush so we put in our order right away. I got the whiskey river bbq chicken sandwich and my niece got the clucks (chicken tenders) and shrimp. Both came with bottomless steak fries. Our orders came out about 10 mins later - when it was placed down, the server said ok clucks and shrimp and a burger. I said I'm sorry I didn't order a burger - he said oh I'm so sorry - I see burgers all day so I just said burger, but yes this is a chicken sandwich. Umm ....ok? Is it chicken or is it tuna? =) All in all, the food wasn't bad - chicken sandwich had a nice flavor to it and my niece enjoyed her meal, didn't go for seconds on the fries but what we did get was hot and crispy. Although our server was nice, he forgot to bring us a box for leftovers, we had to remind him. If using a credit card, you can now pay directly at the table on a tablet - tip can be added after you've swiped.

Some of our food was hot while other food was as if it had been sitting out for a while.

I've never been asked this before ordering a drink and it was slightly embarrassing. We were sat in a very small booth directly in front of the door which made it extremely chilly for us, and near the entrances to the kitchen even though there were several available tables. Throughout the meal, I overheard who appeared to be managers complaining to one another about the employees.  It doesn't make me feel good about eating somewhere when I hear that the hostess has been seating guests at tables that were not wiped down. First we ordered pretzel bites, which were extremely greasy. I didn't like the taste of the beer cheese dip but was unable to ask our server for another dipping sauce because the next time we saw her was when she brought out our entrees.  I ordered the crispy chicken tender salad which sounded great. ""...Hard-boiled eggs, hardwood-smoked bacon, tomatoes and Cheddar over mixed greens."" The ingredients in my salad that were NOT listed on the menu were the ones that ruined it. Usually in a tossed salad, you don't notice the cabbage and carrots. At least one fourth of my plate was cabbage. I picked out much of it out and was able to see just how much there really was. After I ate most of the lettuce and toppings, I realized that the entire bottom layer was shredded carrots. At least a third of my salad was carrots. My friend insisted on buying me the chocolate fruffles for dessert even though I was ready to go. The fruffles were not soft as advertised in the menu, but came straight from the freezer.

Kristin P.,"North Kingstown, RI",0,4,,5.0,4/14/2013,"I've read a lot of bad reviews for this Red Robin so I felt the need to leave an awesome review.  First off, we have always enjoyed great service whether in the bar (awesome if there's a wait for the dining room) or in the dining room. Our favorite waitress is Emily and she has an amazing memory - she remembers us and our order every time! She also is one step ahead of everything you need like drinks, dipping sauces or fry refills. Recently we started getting their new spinach dip (which is amazing) but beforehand we got the fried zucchini and mushrooms (also very good). I am a fan of their royal burger (no pink due to digestion issues). The one time it was accidentally served with pink, they took it back no fuss and replaced it in no time with a hot, juicy, perfectly cooked burger. I also love their whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap. It's always the perfect combination of crunchy tortillas, hot chicken and cold lettuce and tomato with just the right amount of sauce. My fiancé loves the bonzai burger and the royal burger. Their fries are always hot and seasoned very well.  We actually don't go that often due to traffic around the mall, but I'd say we go at least twice a month. Sometimes we just want takeout burgers and go to Five Guys which is closer. However, we still love Red Robin. We are also part of their rewards club and have gotten free birthday burgers and every 10th burger is free.

Tony S.,"North Smithfield, RI",4,7,,1.0,8/18/2012,"Let me start off by saying this rating applies to this location in Warwick RI only as I have had good experiences at other Red Robin locations... I was originally going to review this Red Robin after my first visit which was a very disappointing experience, however I figured they were newly open at the time, new staff so screw it give them another chance or two to win me over, well they haven't. I went in with my family yesterday late afternoon approximately 4pm and the place was slow, very very slow. We were greeted at the front door immediately by the hostess however we had to have her repeat herself a couple of times because the music was so loud we couldn't hear her over it. She seated us promptly and that is where the problems began, I ordered a diet coke and it tasted bad, not like diet coke at all, but I figured OK their mix must be off no biggie happens all the time, any way we placed our order and my son need to use the restroom, so we walked to the restroom, as we rounded the corner we were greeted by a staff member sprawled out in a booth sleeping and continued on our way to the restroom. The restroom was clean however just before traditional dinner time on a Friday evening you should probably ensure your restrooms have paper towels to dry your hands with, as both machines were completely empty. as we walk back to our booth past the sleeping staff member I remember looking at the table thinking wow still no food, considering the place was empty and  our order consisted of 2 burgers, a corn dog for my son and chicken fingers and ribs for my daughter.  When the food arrived the disappointment really set in, Myself, my wife's, and my daughters fries were cold... not warm, cold to the touch cold. Both mine and my wife's burgers were also cold, actually the only thing that was close to hot was my sons corn dog which was actually over cooked but at least it was warm for him to eat.  When the server came back to ask how we were doing we told her of the issues and she went to get her manager, I will give the manager credit as she was very apologetic didn't charge us for anything (not for nothing if she didn't waive the prices, except my my sons corn dog, I would have flipped out as nothing was eaten) But anyway she showed concern, apologized, offered to re cook our meals, and gave us a coupon for 2 free entrees and 2 free kids meals, which we will probably never use. I don't know how this location is so bad and the others I have visited are vastly better but the lack of quality control, and staff control at this establishment reflects poorly on their management.... remember management you can't get away with having to comp food all the time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=80

Constantly, I would see these commercials for Red Robin on TV and I really wanted to check one out.  Hell, these burgers have the ability to CATCH CRIMINALS. So, much to my delight, Red Robin kicked Macaroni Grill out of their location next to the Warwick Mall and decided to serve the greater Warwick area with delicious burgers.  They were, in fact, delicious.  However, I'm not sure if most of the staff mentally knew where they were that night. I went there with a friend who shares my excitement for a good burger on a Saturday night.  It was crowded and took awhile to get a seat, but that's expected.  Finally, we were guided to our seat with that smile only seen in training videos that one watches in a closet on their first day. We sat down and I was impressed because there was no napkins.  That's right, I was impressed.  Clearly, these burgers were so good that I wouldn't need to clean up after myself.  Much to my disappointment, this was just an error on their part and I was given napkins. Time to order and when asked for the size of a 12oz or 23oz beer...I clearly had to supersize my order.  When I got it, she brought me a 12oz.  They're already trying to cut me off. Got our food and the burgers were good.  Like finger licking good (luckily I had napkins!)  The fries were your normal type of fries. Well, it was time for us to leave and we requested the check after trying to flag down our waitress.  When we got the bill, we saw the total amount we had to pay: $0.00.  Our meal was free?!  Oh wait...no it wasn't...apparently she messed up on the receipt and put into the computer that we already paid.  After having her fix this, along with trying to charge me for a 23oz that I never got, we paid and went on our merry way. Would I come back?  Probably not.  The staff isn't well trained and most look confused.  If they cooked the burgers themselves, I'm pretty sure I'd be served a bun patty in between two burgers.  That...I would definitely need a napkin for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=80

The restaurant was able to accommodate a party of 4 at 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon fairly easily, which I attribute to the newness of Red Robin finally wearing off.  We were seated at a very clean booth, and what I appreciated most was the lack of clutter that's seen typically at chain restaurants: various drink promotion cards, the drink/dessert menu, gift card promo cards, salt/pepper, ketchup, malt vinegar...the list goes on. Our waiter was quick to come to the table and get our drink orders, and was attentive without being overbearing. For lunch, I opted for the Souper Sandwich Combo - for roughly $11 you get a full sized sandwich and a side soup. The BLTA (BLT plus avocado on a croissant) was surprisingly tasty. Like really tasty.

Lisa D.,"El Dorado, AR",61,38,,2.0,6/15/2012,"I just finished my second visit to Red Robin. I think it will be the last. It's not good enough for an adult night out, and too expensive for a kids-level meal.  The service is average, while the decor is equivalent to a rough collection of mismatched treasures amassed by the weird older brother of your middle school crush.  Trappings aside, the food is just not that good. The fries are bottomless, but who wants more pale, dry steak fries? The toppings have mild flavor, but the most painful taste offender is the burger. There is something unsavory about the meat... It has very little/ no beef flavor, and the texture is a sponge-like, as though it were a firmish cake rather than a beef patty. I'm not sure it's 100% beef, honestly.  At about $10 for the burger and $2.50 for a soda, this felt like a rip off.  And now for a phrase that has never before crossed my lips: ""Go to Applebee's instead.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=100

I was surprised to see the parking lot full on a Monday evening but they had plenty of room in the restaurant so no wait for a table. Almost everywhere there was family's full of children so I assume perhaps its a family place for a ""gourmet"" burger. Anyhow, the waitress was decent not to attentive but very nice I almost felt bad I sent the food back. Getting to the food now, the food when I got it was cold to the touch, the tomato on the burger was warmer than the meat. Absolutely horrible, so bad I sent it back! ( I never send anything back, believe me!). I would say that the place needs more organization, the food sat in the window for more than 5 minutes hence the cold burger. Once I complained I got warm food and decent (for previously frozen) fries. The food tasted good but not the best I've had for that price-point. Better than the other chains such as chili's, applebee's etc for a burger but I will not go there again.

Our server approached us promptly to take our drink orders and greeted us with a warm smile! The service was just out of this world! We would get refills without even asking which is a big deal nowadays! That hardly ever happens!  The menu surprised me as well! It had much more than just burgers! There were salads, sandwiches, wraps, and your typical appetizer foods! Everything looked so delicious but I ended up getting a regular cheeseburger and my husband ordered a sandwich.  The food was good, and although I was satisfied, I have had better. My husband ordered broccoli instead of french fries and still got the fries.

Orlando R.,"North Providence, RI",21,87,13,4.0,11/17/2011,"""REEEEEEEEEEEED ROBIN...YUUUUMMM!"" I've eaten at Red Robin a few times now since they finally opened up one here in Rhody. After reading some of the reviews, I honestly don't know why most of them are so negative about this place. I work in a restaurant myself and work through rush hours. It's nothing to be happy about trust me when you have people hounding you all at once...but to be honest I've yet to have a bad experience here. The food is just awesome. First time I came here with my girlfriend and one of my good friends. My girlfriend is from Texas so she knows how Red Robin is, but as for me and my friend we've never tried it. I went ahead and ordered the Wiskey River BBQ Burger with endless fries and mac & cheese. First off let me just say that that burger was one of the juiciest I've eaten in a long time from a fast food joint. I also put some of that special spice blend they leave on the table and it absolutely rocked on my burger. Very tender, juicy, and hearty and it gave the burger lots of flavor. I ate the whole thing. The fries were really good and so was the mac & cheese. That meal gets an A from me. The waitress we had was really pleasant as well. It was worth the money I'd say.  The second time I came here I tried the Burnin' Love burger. If you've read some of my reviews you know I'm a Spice Lord, and this burger was full of it no doubt. Juicy, spicy, steamin' hot and really good. I enjoyed it! I was offered more fries but unfortunately I couldn't go another round. The burgers so far are awesome and hopefully next time I stop in I'll try some of the chicken or a different burger.  Like I said I have yet to experience a bad time here. I mean c'mon people, this is Rhode Island what do you expect...where are you gonna find southern hospitality around here? All that matters is that the food was totally awesome and I plan on coming back for more! The only con I have is that every time I've come here so far, I ALWAYS catch someone falling on the way down to the dining area. You guys might wanna fix the floor over there on that small ""hill"" or add a rug because people keep falling down. One of my friends actually fell too.

Lastly, when our burgers were delivered, the guy (not our original waitress) asked if we wanted another drink and I ordered a beer, but that never arrived.  We noticed the table next to us also ordered drinks that never arrived.

We ordered an appetizer & meals for ourselves too. About 15 minutes later, our appetizer came out... but our waitress still hadn't brought our drinks over. We flagged her down & she brought them over, then informed me that the kitchen was out of broccoli, so I asked what other vegetables they had & she said carrots so I got those instead.

We went one night before we went to the movies.   We waited about 45 minutes for our food and there were probably about like 10 people in there.  The servers were never to be found.  We waited 18 minutes on the dot for our drinks and we only ordered a soda and a water.  My Boyfriend got a burger medium well - it was covered in some weird mayo sauce that was hot, but once he got to the center he noticed it was extra pink and cold so he didnt finish it but we were sick of waiting for waiters to come by, and by that time he didnt want anything to do with any of the burgers. We were already late for our movies anyways.  The waiter never even offered to recook it or take it off the bill.   Then the bill came it was 40$ I was so ready to walk out.  He ended up with food poisoning and in the hospital 2 days later.  it was awful.  we will never be back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=120

Kate T.,"North Kingstown, RI",1,15,1,1.0,10/4/2011,"Awful, awful, awful. My husband and I went to RR on a Friday night. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, but we waited for over 30 minutes. I don't mind waiting, but I'd appreciate being given a real idea of what the wait is going to be. We were finally seated and then waited another five minutes before we were even greeted by the waitress. She apologized for the wait and took our entire order, since we had plenty of time to look at the menu at that point. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and an entree. The drinks showed up but the appetizer never came I didn't see the waitress at all or I would have asked where the appetizer was. Fifteen minutes later the entrees came and I asked to just cancel the appetizer order. The waitress apologized and said she would ask if she could take it off the bill. She also said the manager would be over to speak with us but he never came over even though he walked past our table several times. The food was very unimpressive. My husband ordered a $10.50 burger that has been heavily advertized in print and on TV, but the burger he got looked nothing like the one in the commercials. After the meal was over, the waitress brought the bill. We wanted to pay with cash but we needed change. We waited over ten minutes for the waitress to come back to pick up the cash/give us change but finally I just went up to the bar and asked for change there. Bottom line: Food: overpriced and underwhelming Service: shoddy at best",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=120

Tony L.,"East Taunton, MA",9,18,5,2.0,8/12/2012,Great service but Restraunt was out of a lot of supplies. The food was greasier than other Red Robbins we have eaten at.

Steven P.,"Chepachet, RI",102,122,,4.0,10/9/2011,"Our family's first Red Robin experience was hovering around a one-star rating, but maybe because I was in a  good mood, I'll give them a four instead for turning around an epic disaster. Let me explain. We visited early on a Sunday afternoon at a very busy hour, and was told there was a 25 minute wait. We were in no hurry, and the family had been looking forward to the visit, so we chose to hang around and tough it out. As our 25 minute wait morphed into a 45 minute wait, we noticed that there were several empty tables, but no one was being seated. We were also watching the frenetic kitchen staff try to fill the 30 or more hanging order tickets visible from the dining room. Something was wrong. Two obnoxious elderly women, who had been seated, walked out saying they had been waiting over an hour for their orders and gave up, instructing us to follow them out. The hostesses were receiving severe grief from nearly everyone by now, and their stress levels were visible and likely at an all time high. Customers entering the front door were being turned away. Who knows why we chose to hang around. After an hour, with the dining room nearly empty, we were finally escorted to our table. Our server was friendly and eager to apologize. She said something went wrong in the kitchen and they were unable to fill any orders for a while. That's when they decided to no longer seat people. She said a group of employees who were on their way to Nashua to open another restaurant were re-routed and called in to get things back into shape. Our server was attentive, pleasant and fast, despite the drama, and our orders came out hot, fresh and delicious. I ordered the ""Royal Red Robin Burger"" that included a fried egg. Honestly, other than adding cholesterol to the meal, I'm not sue what purpose the egg serves since you can't taste it with all the other flavors in the burger. And who can argue with bottomless steak fries? Our server went out of her way to be sure we were taken care of,and dropped by the table often to express her appreciation for our patience. We could have easily walked out early on and never returned. With some background working with the public, I sympathized with the staff and was impressed with how they pulled things together and gave my family a good meal and good experience. Good thing for them, I guess, I wasn't in a hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=140
Bill W.,"Westborough, MA",32,243,183,2.0,10/6/2011,"With so many great places to eat in RI it is hard to believe these guys can keep their doors open. I have eaten here twice and it is basically overpriced, run of the mill, average food. I am not saying it is bad but it just is; I feel major buyers remorse after spending $20-$25 on a burger, fries, and a drink.

Reginald C.,"West Warwick, RI",66,2,,1.0,4/5/2015,"My church had a youth night and we decided to come here for dinner before heading to the movies.. We waited 15 mins to be seated. Which is ok.. However when we finally were  getting seated there was food all over the floor at are table which was disgusting.. Took them another 2 minutes to clean it.. We finally got seated, took another 5minutes just to order water...my appetizers came before the group received there waters! Really? ..are meals finally came. My burger was not cooked well done as I requested. And the buns felt as if it was sitting in the heat for two days. My sister had a salad that they did not have right. Nobody came to check on us to see if we were doing ok, no re fills on drinks till the bill came in. That's when I told the manager how I felt after he asked how the service was . And he seemed to get upset with my honesty and he quickly became defensive. He then offered to take my burger and the salad off the bill...Saving me a few bucks didn't make the experience any better.

The waitress Annie that took our order was very polite and our food came out quick and I enjoyed my bbq chicken wrap sandwich and my boyfriend enjoyed his chicken sandwich and the bottomless fries were hot.

Jacqueline D.,"Lakewood, OH",28,125,42,5.0,7/15/2013,"From the time that I walked in to the time I left I had the best service as well as the best experience ever. The first time I came here was on Veteran's Day where  I had awesome service. However it would  not be wise for a company not to piss off a former service woman..definitely not  a good look but the  meal and service was great. Though the place was busy as hell,the waiter was attentive and friendly.  Yesterday I was starving before I wanted to stroll over to Macy's so I stopped by.( Getting my free birthday burger is another plus) I was greeted with a smile by a really sweet hostess. We talked for a little bit and waited for the waiter. My waiter came over...yea wow....tall, killer smile, hot (and hopefully single lol )..he would have been flawless  but for the Red Sox shirt he was wearing,but everyone working there was wearing one so maybe there is hope. Anyway when I was done drooling over my waiter, I believe the manager came over and sat down at my table. He was so adorable. So nice.  We chatted for a bit. He took my order and I waited for my Banzai burger to be made. I used to frequent the Wareham location and even the one in Milford CT. Cooking a burger is pretty simple. I like my well done which is simply leave on the grill until it's fully cooked. For some reason the other two locations can't figure that out, my burger yesterday was on point. Everything was awesome . Seriously, I felt like they rolled out the red carpet for me yesterday. It was crazy. I've been to some high priced places and I can say not one place has treated me like they did yesterday at a burger joint. A really hot waiter was the perfect touch too. In all seriousness, I was more than taken care of and I really do appreciate it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=140

There was no I'll be right with you, no can I help you, nothing. When she came back without so much as looking at me, I actually had to ask her if this was where I would place my take out order, if only to remind her to do her job. The food was good, but portions were kinda small for the price.  We enjoyed our burger, salad, and sweet potato fries, but my son's grilled cheese was way below average.  I had a delicious drink while I waited for the food to come out, freckled lemonade. The bartender was nice, not very attentive though since I sat for awhile and had to ask for a drink instead of being offered service.

Megan B.,"Exeter, RI",142,6,,2.0,1/27/2013,"I was SO excited to try this place since they are the only place around serving gluten free burgers with a bun! I really really really wanted it to be good. Unfortunately, the only two things that were good were the service (waiter was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about gluten free items) and the strawberry milkshake. And, one more thing, the gluten free BUN was good as well. The fries were lukewarm, soggy, and mostly very undercooked. The burger had no flavor, and neither did the cheese. The bacon was so thin I could see through it, and there were only 2 small slices on the burger. No good. I guess I'm back to getting Five Guys take out and slapping it on a gluten free bun at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=140

Waitress comes back to see what we want for lunch, we order and ask where our tenders are. ""Oh, they will be right out"". She says. Waiting, waiting...and here she comes with our burgers!!
