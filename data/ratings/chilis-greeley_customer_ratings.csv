12,ElizabethAnn B.,"Denver, CO",103,284,255.0,4.0,2013-03-11,"Ya know Chili's may be just another chain restaurant but from beginning to end our waitress made the entire visit just awesome. From greetings and selling to offering a free dessert for the man's birthday, EVERY server should take after Josette.  To say that we were impressed would be an understatement! Thanks for making a quick birthday bite with a gift card a great one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
13,David G.,"Greeley, CO",8,14,,1.0,2013-12-09,"Chili's used to be a decent place to eat. Now the food quality is very low. We were there Sat night 12/7/13 and had the honey chipotle chicken strips, we used to get 4 large strips, not now, they give you 3 or 4 small 2 bite size pieces, and the fr fries used to be nice 4 inch frys....not now....they have cut back on the quantity and they are like 1 1/2in small frys. Needless to say they have lost a long time customer for good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
7,Joe H.,"Greeley, CO",10,286,25.0,3.0,2014-03-02,"Ya know, it may be a franchise, but Chili's is an a-ok place to go. Food is always good and generous, wait staff is always attentive and prompt - even when they're outrageously busy.  I think this is a darn fine place to go on occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
11,Cathi L.,"Mangum, OK",2,103,16.0,1.0,2014-07-01,"My husband and a I went there for lunch today and it was horrible. My turkey, avocado bacon club had Dat under a heat lamp for so long that the lettuce was cooked. So I sent it back and waited for 20 minutes for them to make a new one. When it finally got to me the fries were not all the way done and they were greasy.  My husband's flat bread pizza had a piece of black plastic on it. Plus our waitress was no where to be found. The last 3 times I have gone to Chili's it has been really bad, I will not eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
0,J.B. R.,"Greeley, CO",85,60,20.0,4.0,2015-08-16,"This is a Chilis chain restaurant, that being said it is on the better end of most Chilis that I have eaten at.  The customer service here is always really good as well as the food is always served in a timely fashion.  The margaritas are what I come for!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
9,Steven W.,"Windsor, CO",0,23,,2.0,2016-01-31,"Service was good but the food is not. For whatever reason they love dumping salt on everything. Also just feels dirty, a lot of stuff on the ground.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
8,Matthew J.,"Greeley, CO",112,4,3.0,5.0,2016-03-31,The service and food were awesome. All special requests made correct the first time and the speed was on point. Great place for lunch,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
6,Alicia Kristen Q.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,5,,4.0,2016-07-30,"As generic as it may be, I can't get enough of the Chili's chips and salsa! Food and service is always good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
10,Jon V.,"Greeley, CO",0,6,,1.0,2016-08-03,"A sore disappointment.  I know they are a chain but they don't all operate the same.  Our family joke is at the Greeley Chilis, what Chilis will we get tonight, until last night.  We are done! First off we walk in with a child and the girl directs us to the bar, no thank you can we have a table.  Then without exaggeration it was easily 10 minutes before we even saw a server on the floor, let alone one to take our drink order.  Must have had a group hug going on in the kitchen.  Then when we got our ""crap shoot"" as we call it, we never know what queso & chips we will get, will it be the soup of the day, will it be almost set concrete, but no, we got.....drum roll.... Burnt tasting weird flavor, did this go thru the dishwasher before we got it queso.  But wait, there is more.  Next was my wife's chile chicken, that was stiffer than a woodpeckers lips because it was so overcooked, and they told us that the delay in our order was due to my prime rib tacos (which I wouldn't order again, 2 small pieces of prime and 5 buckets of picoDeGallo (?).  But then we are half way thru our meal before they can get fries out to my daughter, apparently the prime rib tacos weren't the only issue and Boom! Hat trick, over cooked fries and so greasy that I took one with me out to my truck because I was a quart low in oil, but not any longer, thank you Chilis oil & lube!  Maybe go to the Loveland location but we are for sure done here.  PS, all of us when to bed with nausea, apparently the queso was a bad choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
5,Nikki H.,"Greeley, CO",52,1,,1.0,2016-08-09,Don't eat here....ever!  It was horrible all around. The queso was orange but tasted like 3 day old homel chilli. The chips were greasy and clumped together and the steak was so hard and rubbery we spit it out in our napkins.  It was cold and dirty. The people working were cooking and running cash register.  Not cool. I want our money and time back spent there. Gross!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
4,Tonya S.,"Lima, OH",10,20,8.0,5.0,2016-09-29,"Had a wonderful lunch today with my husband. Food is great, service is even better. I watched them clean after people left...let me tell ya it wasn't no swip the table with a damp rag. They actually cleaned. I was so impressed.  Let me just say thank you to Tiffany. Your awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,

2,Connie F.,"Windsor, CO",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-08,"I usually am okay with chain restaurants, I know what I'm getting. Sadly this location is different from other locations I've visited, this Chili's is horrible.  Visited before lunch rush, so they were slow. Sat in a bar booth, bartender was very chatty with people at the bar about sports,but 10 minutes of sitting there listening I gave up, got up,went to the hostess to be seated in the restaurant side so I would be waited on. Sat at my table and finally got service, ordered and then noticed how filthy this Chili's is. As in, I don't think they even cleaned he night before or decided that morning to have a huge chip fight and leave all of the chips on he floor, along with other junk. Table wasn't clean. Floors were nasty, decided to avoid using the restroom to be safe. DO NOT go to this location. Dirty, rude, too busy chatting to wait on customers and he food wasn't even hot, not that my server ever checked up on me. Way too many other options near by to bother eating  here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
1,Briana R.,"Greeley, CO",16,2,,1.0,2017-11-11,"Manager on the night of Veterans day 2017. I decided to take out my father for a nice dinner since he is a United States Airforce Veteran. As soon as we walked in there were about 15 people waiting and no hostess in sight. So we patiently wait for her to finally appear and blatantly ignore us. Then we see the manager, she was wearing normal clothing(no uniform)in a dress up floral shirt, my father who has been patiently waiting to just put our name in politely walks up to her to give her our name only to have the MANAGER rudely put her finger in my fathers face and tell him to wait. Which we did, a little irritated at this point, we put our name in to find out the wait is 15-20min (no problem!) we sit down and wait our turn. After 20 min of waiting still with 2 parties ahead of us, a family of 8 walk in and put there name in to be seated.. Not even two minutes later she sits the table of 8 at 3 SEPERATE tables near each other and completely skips over the rest of us who have been waiting 20+min. So now we are upset and decide to ask the manager if this Chili's runs by first come first served... Only to have the MANAGER once again put her finger in my father's face and told him no. So we immediately left without hesitation! Go to loveland Chili's, it's worth the drive for quality customer service and no rude managers who don't even help there staff buss tables!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greeley,,,,,
