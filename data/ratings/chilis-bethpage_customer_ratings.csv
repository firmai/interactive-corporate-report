61,Laura C.,"Farmingdale, NY",33,97,,2.0,2012-01-28,"Because I work locally , I gave into hunger pangs and went to Chilis against my better judgement. Someone who loves me , please smack me for my laziness in choosing  the local dopey chain place instead of seeking something a little better!!! I'm not a food snob as anyone can see.  I mean , shit, I seriously like Popeye's fried chicken!  Having said that, the food was ok but  no love was going into your plate.  Try desperation and panic more like it! lol We were seated promptly and our orders were taken quickly.  But for whatever reason, our simple order of a burger & cheesesteak took forever.  When it arrived my bacon cheeseburger had burnt bacon, burnt roll , and maybe 1o fries.  The cheesesteak  sandwich came out as sliders instead of a sandwich with the same lack of fries.  I didn't send the burger back , but we sent the cheesesteak sliders back because they looked lame.  I mentioned to our server about the fries and she did promptly send a basket of fries over, gratis.  When the cheesesteak arrived, it lacked cheese and onions& peppers and was a soggy mess.  Not in a fun way , either.  We also ordered nachos and they were tasty.  The best part of the meal , actually. Our server was very sweet and the place did get hit with a lunch rush.  I know from service experience that the kitchen snafus werent due to the server.  But, I left knowing I could have made a tastier choice- elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=60,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248
64,Allison M.,"Bethpage, NY",0,15,,1.0,2012-04-02,What a horrible experience! We went the other night for my cousin's boyfriend's birthday. The waiter took 20 minuted to come to the table to introduce himself and take our drink order. When he (Joe) finally came he claimed it took him so long because the utensils were not done in the dishwasher. Whatever that means.  He was rude and didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or anything else after our meal. He brought the check and I wanted to order coffee. He got mad and gave us an attitude. Needless to say we left him no tip and will not return to this restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=60,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

This location makes you wait for 20 minutes when they have several tables open. Additionally, there are tables waiting to be cleared. Those tables took a long time for a buss person to clean them off. The manager on duty walked past the dirty tables several times but did nothing about it. The hostess couldn't understand why the people waiting at the door were annoyed at her....perhaps because she not only had an attitude problem, but didn't want to do anything help help resolve the problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=60,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

We ordered burgers, well-done. When we got them, I emphasize an HOUR after ordering, they were... let's say rare, to be generous.

33,Christopher C.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",255,124,75.0,4.0,2013-02-22,"I gotta say this is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  I come here all the time and am rarely, if ever disapointed.  First off, when you come to a place like chilis you gotta know what to expect, your not gonna have the best meal you ever had in your life, the food is not gonna be of a superior quality, but its gonna be damn good and hit the spot.  My usual go to appetizer at chilis is the classic nachos with extra jalapenos.  Its about 10 tortilla chips with beans, queso, and melted cheese served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  So good! The last time I was there I wanted to try something new so I went with the jumbo soft pretzels. They were fresh, soft and served with a delicious cheese sauce. For the entree i usually go with the steak fajitas which I usually eat without the tortillas.  They come out steaming hot with peppers and onions, and sides of sour cream, guacomole, cheese and tomatoes.  The last time I was there I was in the mood for the spicy shrimp tacos.  They give you three tacos with grilled shrimp, cilantro lime slaw, avocados, and pico de gallo with a spicy chile lime sauce.  It was great, hit the spot with just enough spice. Now as far as dessert I usually dont get it because I'm usually on my 6th or 8th beer by now, considering there 2 for 1, another great thing about chilis. All day everyday!!. But this last time I had the chocolate chip cookie skillet which basicall is a large fresshly baked cjocolate chip cookie with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on it.  Yes, I was in heaven it was fantastic.  Yes, a very simple dessert but damn, it was great. I left Chilis a very happy man. Thank you chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=20,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

54,Jeanette E.,"Levittown, NY",12,35,16.0,5.0,2013-05-06,"UPDATE 3/25/14 - I'm very happy to update my review.  This place has more than redeemed itself over the last few months as far as I'm concerned.  This place has been on point with their food and service.  Chili's rocks! It pains me to give a bad review to a Chili's restaurant.  I really love the food and the atmosphere, but service is a huge deal to me and this place has gone way downhill in that department.  I've attempted to call-ahead numerous times, and each time I've been told I don't need to put my name on the call-ahead list because there is no wait. Even when I say I'd really like to have my name on, they insist there is absolutely no one waiting and there is no reason for it. It seems that in the 5-minute drive from my house, hoards of customers have arrived each time this has happened, and our wait is 20-30 minutes.  In my former life I wouldn't have cared, but dining out with a 1-year-old has changed my dining-out experience.  Part of the reason I like coming to Chili's is that it's a kid-friendly atmosphere and I feel comfortable if he's a little noisy.  But after waiting 30 minutes just for a table, he's usually a mess by the time our food comes, and it's a horrible experience for me and the other patrons around me which is unfair to everyone.  It's too bad because especially with a young child, dining out can be such a relief and a fun experience.  Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case here for us lately.  I don't think I'll be dining here again for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=40,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.8360000000000003
34,Katie H.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1212,687,492.0,4.0,2013-05-13,"Honestly, I really believe that Chili's is different from most chain restaurants. I like their food a lot. Overall, I have never had a bad experience here and the staff is very friendly and willing to go the extra mile. I went right before Cinco De Mayo (I was craving a margarita soo badly) and I couldn't decide on what flavor to get for my ""El Presidente"" rita and the waitress was kind enough to give us flavor samples. She also got us extra chips too. Some of the drinks are 2fers or BOGO, which is a sweet deal.  I love the 2 for $20 menu and whenever I go out with friends we usually pair up and get that. My main go-to dishes are the chicken fajitas or the chicken quesadillas. They're always piping hot and delicious. I love getting the chips (they're very addicting). Chili's is a really social place for people of all ages. It's good for a hangout, date, family time, etc. And as for the drinks, the El Presidente is one heck of a killa'. Be warned... super tasty but the top shelf tequila creeps up on you quickly. The sunrise one is really good too.

66,A A.,"Levittown, NY",2,28,1.0,1.0,2013-06-29,"We were having a lovely dinner with our party of 5 and our infant.  Our server was wonderful, the runners were great, but we had our dinner completely ruined by the manager of the Bethpage Chilis.  She was incredibly rude, insulting, and nasty.  There was an issue in which she insisted that we move our infant car seat out of the way so another table of two could be seated.  I told her that wasn't going to work for us because there was no place to move our baby.  The tables are very close together and it was a busy night.  We were in the middle of paying the check and she was insisting that we needed to move the seat.  I told her that she could wait because we were just finishing dinner and packing up.  At that point, the manager told me that she didn't know what to do because the other couple was mad at her.  They felt they needed to be seated immediately.  I explained to her that the server was clearing another table for that couple at the moment.  I also told her once again that we were just waiting for our bill, and we were leaving.  She then told me that I wasn't very nice.  I find her inexperience with ""managing"" unbelievable.  Chilis gets very busy and I would think that a manager would be more adept at managing customers.  She was still yelling at me while the other couple was already seated at a different table.  I am mortified at how she treated me in front of our family.  She absolutely made a scene in front of the other patrons.  The manager at the Bethpage Chilis needs to be retrained in customer service if she is to continue in her position.  I understand the difficulty in managing an establishment of this size, but I don't understand her loss of composure when dealing with people.  I will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage?start=60,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

Got to my car and checked the receipt to make sure everything was there and it was. Yet, I had a feeling I should check the bag. Turns out the last item I added didn't make it to the bag but they definitely charged me for it. So I went in and was given a little attitude from the bartender when I said I had a missing item. At least I got a ""sorry about that"" when I was handed the missing food. Sigh... maybe the Farmingdale location can do better. Also, Chilis, your mugs are nasty and are ALWAYS dirty.

17,Laurie M.,"Melville, NY",143,32,30.0,1.0,2016-11-07,"I placed an order on Sunday, November 6th at 5:51pm via phone as the online application said that ""one or more of the items I selected was unavailable at this location, please call the store"". I successfully placed the same order on the phone and the order taker told me 15-20 minutes. I get to the store surprised to see many cars on the to-go side. I walk in to the small To-go area where I see a decent amount of people waiting. The cashier, which I later found out to be a manager, was quick to make sure she got everyone addressed and paid for. While waiting I noticed a lot of yelling coming from the kitchen such as items having to be re-fired because this is ""old"" and I can't serve this and or confusions about orders. The kitchen area in the back is somewhat open so you can see into it when waiting. I noticed pieces of food and other garbage on the floor. When the cashier couldn't find some orders I noticed she asks several times to several people if they placed their order over the phone or online. Orders for people ahead of me were eventually resolved and people left. At this time it's now 40 minutes in to when I placed my order and there's 3 of us left waiting for our orders. She asked one gentleman twice and another server asked what his name was and what he was waiting for. He seemed to be getting annoyed by the wait as well. I then asked if she could check on my food because it is now 45 minutes past when I placed my order (if I didn't already pay for my meal I would have walked out at this point). She said the gentleman came in before me and my order would be out right after his, but I know this not to be true because several people came in after me and and left before me. So 50 minutes go by and another person brings out my over stuffed bag and kind of throws it on the counter, asks if it's mine and walks away. I take a look in the bag to see no silverware and food on the bottom of the containers so I ask for another bag to separate so the food doesn't spill in my car. I quickly rearranged the food and left to go home. On the way home I was kind of shocked that during my visit of being in the restaurant for 40 minutes longer than I was promised, I wasn't offered anything or apologized to for the long wait- Not even a glass of water. So, I live 1.3 miles from the restaurant. I open the boxes with my mother and father to notice that the food is ICE cold. Even if the food was prepared while I was waiting it certainly wasn't sitting on any warmers or anything. The cheese on the burger seemed to be completely melted into the burger almost to the point where it looked like there was no cheese on it. The burger was over cooked. My father got half a rack of ribs which was so small he made a joke ""this must have been a tiny pig"". The cheese fries were solidified together and the sauce opened on the quesadilla so it was soaked in whatever sauce was included, again with the cheese being hard. My fresco salad and chicken both came with the ""standard"" sauces even though I asked for different ones. Over all, I think this was a unfortunate experience as we're close to Chili's and visit quite regularly, I don't know if we'd be returning anytime soon. The service and the quality of the food are not even close to what we're used to when visiting this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
4,Jc B.,"West Babylon, NY",244,71,126.0,3.0,2017-01-30,Ok so many people rave about chilis im just left unsatisfied.  It was an immediate seating on a Saturday night so I think we just got there in time. They use a two server per table system which is pretty interesting as to give the best service.  Ordered guacamole and cheese curds for an app. And the two nephews meals were put in as well. The kids meals came out before apps. I was ok with that. Real corn on the cob is ruined by microwaved Mac and cheese. Places really need to switch away from this type for kids. The other kids meal a corn dog and fries. Not bad.  So now the guacamole comes and they do it right next to the table. Everything in a huge bowl and the waiter asks if you want it chunky or smooth. And mixes it table side. Nice and fresh. The fried cheese curds  came with a spicy ranch but tasted fine in their own.  The waiters were on point and laughed when I asked for two cokes to save them time. Being in the industry I know what would help out. They were great servers.  Unfortunately my dinner came. The mashed potatoes although made from real potatoes were extremely bland even with bacon cheese and sour cream. The corn niblets were bland except for the taste of fish yea they tasted fishy. I got a rib eye I love rib eyes. And I love medium rare. The steak was apparently to thin to get it cooked that way. And again very very bland. I put salt pepper and a little ketchup to get some sort of flavor but I got nothing.  I feel that chilis kills it on apps and then loses it on entree.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bethpage,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

Who wants wings without sauce or blue cheese? I also ordered the ancho salmon, which I get all of the time from other chili's establishments and this came out terrible too.
