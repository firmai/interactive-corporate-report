Shari S.,"Perth, Perth, Australia",48,155,893,3.0,8/1/2011,"It's the airport. It's not a proper CPK. Accept those two things and you'll do fine.  Unlike other airport CPKs (McCarran in Las Vegas comes to mind), this is a counter service facility with seat-yourself tables. The menu is smaller than a regular CPK, but there are still at least eight pizza options (two vegetarian), salads, pre-packaged desserts, and breakfast items. You can get a fountain soda or something (Snapple, bottled water, etc.) from the refrigerator case. Tables (two-tops and four-tops) are close together, but if you get a table against a wall or the rail by the walkway, it's not too bad. We chose one by the rail so we could stack our luggage on the other side and not clog the somewhat narrow space between tables.  My husband liked his Thai Chicken pizza, but mine (a Veggie Works) was a little on the cardboard-y side and definitely not as tasty as at a regular CPK. Despite the short cooking time, it was cooked through - something local pizza delivery places sometimes can't offer in their rush to get the pizza to you. The menu doesn't offer make-your-own option that I noticed, and maybe that's key to their speedy turnaround, but you can always ask. The staff was very nice when we visited. Considering that you're in captivity, the prices aren't bad. I paid about $9 for a four-slice circle of around 10 inches. Drinks ran about two bucks and came in two sizes. If you're hungry enough to eat airport food, this will get the job done without being too heavy, snack-like, or simply lacking in nutrients, and the menu is varied enough to suit larger parties. But take ""ASAP CPK"" out of the concourse, and I'm not sure the flavor could make it to two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Vince L.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,678,281,2.0,4/25/2012,"I'm putting on my airport food-service reviewer's cap on. In other words, I'm dropping my level of expectation here. Even with that, I was stunned by the rudeness of the girl taking the order at the counter. I had a few minutes for breakfast before my flight, so I decided to get a breakfast burrito. Here's the exchange: Me: I'd like the breakfast burrito please. Girl: What meat? Me: Uh...where are the choices? Girl puts finger over her shoulder to point at the sign. Me: I'm sorry. I don't see where the choices are. Girl: What meat? I'm trying to scan the whole menu board as fast as I can before I finally see it under the item. I know that I might've been a little slow because it was the morning, but my question is:  wouldn't it have been faster and easier if she just asked, ""bacon or sausage?"" I think so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Jon L.,"Bellevue, WA",805,2131,9776,3.0,11/28/2010,"For an airport place, the food here is decent. Though prices are inflated due to the airport location. The place is set up like a fast food version of CPK with a limited menu. There is a refrigerator case of salads and sandwiches if you need to grab and go before getting on your flight. I had the half sandwich/soup combo ($8.39) which consisted of a choice for each item. I decided on the pesto chicken sandwich and tortilla soup. The soup was rich and warm. The tortilla are given separately which I thought was best. The sandwich which uses focaccia was fine, but a bit slight. The calorie content is a little higher than I expected too. CPK is an okay option out of the food options available at SLC airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Andrew L.,"Seattle, WA",1309,489,513,3.0,7/12/2009,"Hidden down the ways in the terminal, the California Pizza Kitchen - ASAP is a chain located in a bunch of airports.  They serve a couple key items, Thin Crust Personal pizzas, Sandwiches, Soups and Salads.   Their pizzas are simple, and tend to have a good amount of flavor.  They few times I have stopped by, to grab a pizza, it comes out, with a nice crust, and not heavy.  It's light enough, that if you decide to eat it before a flight, you won't be left feeling too full.  Good or bad, depending on your desire for a food coma on the flight, I'm 6'1"" so it isn't going to put me out.  The sandwiches are good, solid, and have good seasoned meats.  The vegetables tasted fresh, and for the location at an airport, it is decent fare.  It's not cheap; you are spending at least $10 bucks, if you are getting a drink also.  There aren't that many food options near this location, and if you have a short hour or less layover, which is the normal time for Delta flights, this place can make your food in about 15 minutes or less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Scott P.,"Los Altos, CA",173,727,511,3.0,7/27/2011,"This is my go to place to get my Thai Chicken pizza craving fixed when I pass through this airport.  Decent enough service, but with a poorly designed register line for anyone who has luggage - at least I get my pizza piping hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Clint W.,"Seattle, WA",310,863,9,3.0,6/8/2008,"Like Nadine, I was in search of food and figured this was the best option.  I managed to grab an oriental chicken salad that tied me over to I got home.  $10!   My buddy had a pizza, which allowed him to sleep through the flight home.  Me, by the time I got home, I was ready to eat again.   It was pretty nice to get some light fare before the plane ride home.  I'm not sure I could suck down a pizza but it's good to know the option is there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Jason S.,"Reno, NV",28,174,3,2.0,8/15/2011,"Dough tasted papery (I refuse to use the overused description ""cardboard""). Tomato sauce was actually good: zesty and bright. Cheese on a cheese pizza was low quality. Trapped in an airport with two hungry little kids-- this place satisfied the hunger, but not the taste buds. Even the kids were un-thrilled (and it's pizza!). Like most everything in an American airport: Avoid if at all possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Ryan T.,"Mountain View, CA",374,796,152,2.0,7/11/2010,"How many people like burned pizza? Well, to be frank, it wasn't so terrible, but still, if something is overdone, not much of any excuse, even if just on the edges. I also must say, albeit a CPK-ASAP store, and after not having CPK in a number of years, this has to be the oiliest looking pizza from a CPK of any kind I've seen. With the simulated wood-burning brick oven, this was just a sad excuse for CPK. But methinks it was still a better choice than Sbarro's, also in the airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Jeff G.,"Provo, UT",8,36,52,4.0,8/27/2010,I can't speak to the quality of the pizza but the breakfast menu is amazing. If you are leaving on an early morning flight skip the scrumptious Cinabons and get something real tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Bert A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",8,61,,2.0,6/12/2008,"Yet another chain to appeal to the masses of Utah. I've been to CPK a number of times and I just don't see what all the fuss is about. BBQ Pizza???  Shrimp Scampi Pizza??? I will say that I like the Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza. Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza????? Yeah, but it was good. Still, chains lose stars with me and if your food can be found in the frozen food section of the local grocery store... well you get the point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
Nadine N.,"Vancouver, Canada",186,724,295,4.0,11/5/2007,"I've already said that I am not a fan of SLC International Airport. However, I am a fan of CPK-ASAP at the airport. I had a morning connection and was starving. I really did not want to eat a muffin in a hermetically sealed bag, so I wandered the concourse looking for something hot and fresh for breakfast. The only thing that matched this description was CPK. It was a good 15 minutes after the posted breakfast time was up, but the good folks at CPK-ASAP were still allowing weary, hungry travelers to order breakfast. It was hot and good. CPK-ASAP is, hands down, the best thing about SLC International Airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4
