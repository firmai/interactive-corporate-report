Zoey A.,"Suisun City, CA",1,5,3,1.0,9/21/2017,This place is total basura Trash!!!!  Service and food is unacceptable. Should of looked at yelp first. SMH,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20
Alexis M.,"Fairfield, CA",1,33,19,1.0,9/11/2017,"Lol at the reviews. Not even necessary for me to explain for my bad experience, looks like everyone else just wrote it for me.  But I'll go ahead anyway. Like everyone else has said... TERRIBLE SERVICE! We were 1 of like 4 parties seated on a slow Monday late afternoon. All of the waitresses had no sense of urgency and one even had her back leaning against the wall while having casual conversation with a guest like she didn't have anything else better to do. I made eye contact with at least two waitresses but I guess to them it doesn't mean anything unless you're verbal about being ready to order. Not like that isn't the waitresses job or anything. I don't even know why I give this place a chance anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20
Ivanna M.,"Fairfield, CA",15,23,1,3.0,10/11/2017,"For a group of 3 people, this place can be a little underwhelming since we waited outside for 10 mins to be seated. Our waitress Jennifer was nice enough to let us know that they are understaffed and there was only one cook and it's going take about 35-40 mind before the food comes out. Knowing that we still waited. Food turned out good and she apologized for the long wait. I'll give this place another go since I feel like we came at A bad time since there was a wildfire going on fairfield.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20
Sabrina J.,"Fairfield, CA",94,123,652,2.0,7/23/2016,"This location is very hit or miss. The appetizer and entree portion of our visit was fine, I will give them that and service was good until we got to the dessert. My sister ordered the cheesecake, my mom had the lemonade cake, and I ordered their yummy mud pie.  The cheesecake was frozen like they literally took it out of the freezer and served it. My sister basically ate large chunks of frozen cheesecake the entire time. My moms lemonade cake tastes like freezer burn. This cake definitely looked like the frozen store bought SaraLee cake but tastes much worse. After 2 bites, my mom was done.  My mud pie was disappointing. It must have sat for a while because it was melted. The biggest and best part of the mud pie is the whipped cream which you can see is visibly missing from my attached photo. We made our server aware of this minor issue and instead of taking the dessert back and adding whipped cream, she brought me a dollop. Seriously, a spoons worth of whip cream on the side, wth??!! After we brought it to her attention again, she said they were out of whip cream, hmmmm, are you sure? Even if they did run out, she could have made that known to begin with. After speaking to the manager, he took the dessert back and guess what??!! He covered it in whip cream. This is the second visit here where we have had to consult management, I won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20
Kash D.,"New York, NY",16,267,324,5.0,2/19/2017,"First time at Red Robin here in Solano Mall.. We got here and there were already 3 people waiting in line to be seated.. But we actually did not cut them, my husband just looked for the hostess/host so we can get in but the host grab a menu and seat us first before the other 3 who got there first.. Funny but we went ahead though.. We ordered Salad Grilled chicken platter.. Our server Mike was accommodating and upbeat guy who chatted with us..  Food was completely delish.. Chicken was so tender and yummy as well as their salad with my requested Honey Mustard Dressing.. Going back here for sure..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20
Kia P.,"South San Francisco, CA",186,15,5,1.0,10/21/2017,"Seating took 5 minutes. Ordered a drink and the waitress came back to notify they were all out. Ordered within 10 minutes.  I waited 30 minutes for food to come out. Mine and my families food came out over cooked and cold. I told I wanted it pink , it was burnt. My mushrooms tasted fried and burnt. Water had a bad after taste. Waitress did not get my mother sauce that was ordered with initial order. Thanks for a good birthday lunch Red Robin.

Michael P.,"Vallejo, CA",18,62,47,1.0,12/21/2017,"I hate writing negative reviews of businesses and establishments, but this one has to be written for the benefit of you (as the customer/consumer), and hopefully (if they take the time to read this) the business/establishment to improve upon.. Anyway, my buddy and I chose to eat here as he had won a gift card from his work. We came around 7pmish on Wednesday and we spoke with the seater about getting a seat. We were sat within 15 mins. The wait did not bother my friend and myself. However... roughly 10-12 mins of being sat down at a table, 2 female customers (arriving after us) sat across from us and within literally 3-5 mins, a waitress had come and attended to them... like wow... really?? My friend and I had looked through the menu which only took 5 mins and we waited to be attended only to have the next table who came after us attended first... not only that, but the podium employee attended to both them and made sure their waitress would serve them. My friend and I just literally watched as this was happening and we made eye contact with both the podium employee and waitress to which we were ignored... heck, even a couple who came shortly after that were attended to in a timely manner. As for me and my friend, we were literally ignored! I'm not one for causing a scene or complaining aggressively, but when two tables that arrive after you get served first, and you have to literally get up and look for the server and waitress to inform them that you haven't been served or attended to just goes to show how lacking they are in service. Finally our waitress came and informed us that no one had told her we were seated (as if making eye contact wasn't enough) she apologized and took our order. While the waitress was nice and apologetic, we did not get any sort of complimentary food/drink/discount for the inconvenience. The food to be honest came out mediocre. The fries were hot outside and crisp, but was cold in the inside. The bacon tavern burger was ok, comparable to a Burger King whopper. My friend had ordered the A1 burger which he said was good but the fries were undercooked as well. We were both really hungry and just decided to not waste the food and it all.. our waitress not once even checked if we needed refills on our water. She did come back one time to ask if we wanted more fries to which we happily declined due to the way things turned out. We couldn't wait to leave. Thank goodness we had the gift card and just used that to pay for the meal. So no money really wasted on our end. I know it was a busy and crowded time, but come on.. I've worked in busy restaurants before and I've always managed to serve tables in proper order. We weren't even asked how we wanted the meat cooked.. not that it mattered anyway but in customer service (especially waitressing and serving) you ask specific things your customers want or don't want. We didn't even get that option. I always like to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were busy. However, the way service and food was rendered did not justify that. I felt miserable and totally ignored dining at this Red Robin. When I got home my stomach was feeling upset and without going into excessive detail, my digestive system did not agree with the food either. Upon reviewing , I remembered that the fries were undercooked so that may have had something to do with it. Really, my major complaint is that we were ignored and served last as other tables that arrived after us were served promptly. Followed by the mediocrity of the food. I myself will never return and dine at this specific location in the Solano mall. In the end it's up to you to dine here if you want. I recommend reading the other reviews first before you go. Who knows?? Maybe you'll get better service and quality. If I could, this place would get no stars. 0/10.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20

Manny G.,"Fairfield, CA",51,3,,1.0,10/28/2017,This restaurant used to be very very well and very exciting to go to get a great burger. But since they change the format of the restaurant the burgers not fresh very stale no flavor... there's less fries in there very very greasy. I was a restaurant and I gave it a special for 699 Burger I would make the burgers so you would want to come back unfortunately this restaurant is a restaurant I would definitely avoid going home do not go if you want to feel like you're lonely like they don't pay attention and when you do get the food feels like even punished or you did something wrong sad home a great restaurant has been so bad,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20
Sherry K.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",5,13,2,1.0,10/29/2017,"Dirty, understaffed, no one cares!  This location is in a mall and has two entrances (we did not know this).  We entered from the parking lot entrance but no one was there, a good while later we walked through the restaurant to discover the mall entrance where we came upon a rather unkempt young man in a dirty uniform shirt standing behind the host stand.  He was totally unconcerned with why we might be there.  We asked for a table and proceeded to wait.  We asked and he confirmed he was responsible for both entrances, he wasn't capable of efficiently managing one entrance let alone two.  No greeting, no acknowledgement, nothing.  He needs to be working on the curb dressed as a liberty tax sign and hopping around for $2 per hour.  We were seated and provided water fairly quickly, then placed an order for two adults and two children about 45 minutes later.  Fries arrived stone cold, no eating utensils provided, the rest was ehhh!  Server was overworked (there were only two for the entire restaurant plus ""manager"" helping to run food), everything was overlooked, late, or cold.  Trip to the restroom sealed the deal, gross!!!!! This was at 7PM on Sat night, no wonder it wasnt very busy, its a mis-managed dump, go ANYWHERE else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20
Chelsea L.,"Davis, CA",39,6,7,2.0,8/4/2017,"I really like Red Robin...just not this location...it literally sucks a**. This Fairfield one seriously needs new management because that is the underlying issue to most of the bad reviews. We checked yelp before going but decided that because we like Red Robin that it should be fine and the negative reviews could just be ignored...NO...don't ignore the bad reviews like we did. It is not worth your time and money to go to this Red Robin.  I went here for a birthday lunch with my fiancé, sister, and her boyfriend around 2:00 pm on Sunday July 30. The person who greeted us as we walked in was super nice and had great customer service.  My sister and I have a couple dietary restrictions that are reasonable to work around at these major chain restaurants. The waitress told us the raspberry iced tea came unsweetened so I ordered that. Upon taking my first sip I was overwhelmed with something akin to liquid sugar...the raspberry tea was clearly not unsweetened. When she returned I requested just a regular unsweetened iced tea because the raspberry one and her response was ""oh its too sweet?"". lightly sweetened and unsweetened are not the same thing....the raspberry iced tea was obviously neither. I can't remember the name but I ordered a black angus fire grilled burger that was one of the higher end burgers available on the menu (~$15). I just wanted a simple burger but this was in the section of the menu where they had ""creative"" selections. By creative I mean they add a bunch of sugar and fat to it.  The burger I ordered originally came with grilled onions, caramelized bacon bits, cheddar cheese, BBQ sauce, and a brown sugar finish to the burger patty. I requested no cheese, bacon, and brown sugar and for it to be wrapped in lettuce...side note: why would you need to add more sugar to a burger by finishing it off with brown sugar? It just shows you how addicted to sugar people are in America.... We waited not 20 minutes for our food, not 30 minutes, but an hour for our food to be delivered. We were about to walk out when our food came. The waitress kept coming by to tell us it was almost ready. She even gave us some ""bottomless"" fries to start on while we waited but the two baskets only had like 10 fries each...10 fries is not really bottomless for four people who are waiting an hour for their food.  Finally when we were about to leave, my sister's boyfriend told the manager we were waiting for almost an hour and voila! our food arrives...how convenient. The food was fine but the customer service by management was horrible. They clearly do not know how to manage if a kitchen takes an hour to cook food. The place was not even busy; several tables were vacant. They didn't even tell us why it took so long but our best guess is they made my order regular and realized it was wrong. One table arrived at the same time as us, ordered the same time but left way before we even got our food. The manager did not even comp anything off our receipt for the inconvenience...apparently 10 ""bottomless"" fries should be satisfactory.  We didn't let the poor overall service that was all on the manager influence the tip for our waitress. She was attentive and provided good service. People like Red Robin and this place would get better reviews if it was more organized and had better leaders for the kitchen staff and the wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20

Our table lamp was out and I guess they couldn't find a blub because all the others were on. the table they put us in was located near the restroom so people were always coming and going.  oh yeah, the kicker now.

Gotta add another review for this crappy place called to place an order and was told that they shut down early because their gas line had a leak! I pull up and they still have costumers walking in and out. I walk in the lady discloses oh we're closed while decorating I said ummmm it's actually 15 min untill close. I just wanted some soup.

The most recent time we went, our waitress was great, but I don't think the rest of the customers had the same experience. A table next to us had gotten the wrong food sent to them, another table had to get up to get their check, and there were about 3-5 tables (with no customers) that had all the plates & mess still on them the entire time we were there!

Leeann P.,"Vallejo, CA",249,111,689,1.0,7/31/2016,"WORST LOCATION EVER. Just left and made it a must to write this review right away. It's like we were invisible when we sat down. Took 20 minutes to even take our order and only because we had to complain and ask for a manager. He then apologized and said he wouldn't let our table be forgotten again. LIE. We literally waited for 35 minutes then we finally decided to ask for the manager again realizing that it's been almost an hour of us sitting at this same table with no food. It felt even worse because the place started getting empty and were still just sitting there. As we're waiting for the manager to come out, the hostess asked if we wanted refills in the mean time. And brought 2 out of 5 of the refills that we had to ask another waitress for the other 3 in which she gave us attitude.  Someone finally brings out our food. Literally just dropped it off then left. Burgers are usually finger food but we also ordered Mac n cheese and soup so obviously we needed utensils and of course, napkins. Since she left so fast we couldn't ask. My boyfriend got really upset and walked to the kitchen to talk to the manager that never came out.  It was a different manager this time named Josiah. After he heard from us, he was very sincere and offered to take care of our bill considering that our experience was ridiculous. Thank you Josiah for doing that but please fix this location and your staffs attitudes. The whole time only the hostess (barely) and the manager actually helped us.  As were walking out, the waitress that was suppose to be ours steps in front of us, ""did you pay?"" With this dumb little neck roll. She really had the audacity to have an attitude with US like we did something wrong. Did you help me at all tonight? No. Did you serve us? No. You have the time to ask us if we paid but where were you the whole time we were there? Ignoring us and only came at the end behind the manager pretending you actually cared. I just wanted to slap the dumbness off her face with her sick attitude. The manager had came out right after she asked us and told her it was okay. Hope she felt dumb.  While we were there, a table of 4 by us was so upset that when the food finally came out to their table, they walked out and left.

Mariah C.,"Fairfield, CA",173,10,24,1.0,2/27/2017,"Super disappointing experience I had tonight with my family. We came in at 9:00pm an hour before closing and were the only ones seated in dining. David, the host, was great, he greeted us and was very helpful.  We didn't really have any problems until it came to our food. Some of our entrees came out around 9:50 - 10pm, pretty much closing. We finished 3/4ths of our meals before the next two peoples arrived. One being a side salad that came out warm after my entree. We ended up taking the salad off and sweat potato fries that we didn't know were out until about an hour later. Even worse, we had a soup that never made it out because it was taking too long. Even better, when we went to check they were just making it.  Once we had some food, they were quicker on giving us endless fries and some ranch. However the miss communication with the staff really messed up the experience. As a former server this was very disappointing because we would of understood any delays if they were reasonable. I think our server tried her best, maybe she's new but we could tell she was overwhelmed with us.  Additionally, if they were closing down the kitchen, we would of much rather been turned away. I understand it's a Monday but we were left in the  dark on how long food was taking and so on.

THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST. The servers are so SLOW and LAZY. We waited over 30 minutes before someone took our order.  Since we were seated by the kitchen I could see what was going on in the back. I saw our food ready and just sitting there for over 20 minutes while our waitress stood there chatting it up with another waitress, while stuffing their face with fries. I understand that they also need to eat, but they're on the clock. They have breaks for that. By the time we got our food, we were starving. My burger was a little cold to be honest, but I was hungry so I ate it anyway. When I asked our server for a refill on my fries she said ""sure"" and never came back with them. My friend wanted to order a drink later into our meal, but again our server was no where to be found.  After an hour of waiting for our server to return, we decided to just leave. We got so tired of waiting for her that we ended up just playing the bill on the little machine thing on the table. When we were paying, our server finally comes back and asks ""you guys doing good?"" and leaves before we can even reply. Still didn't bring my fries, didn't ask if we wanted refills on our drinks or if we wanted dessert. Nothing. Horrible service.  This location is also really dirty. When we first arrived there, a few tables next to us hadn't been cleaned yet, we were there for over 3 hours and they still didn't clean them. Our table was also sticky and we had to wipe it down ourselves with a napkin and some of our water.

The server is the only other positive thing about this place. Yes she did remove the burger from bill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=40
CeeCee M.,"San Francisco, CA",136,1,,1.0,7/27/2017,I just took my girls to Red Robin. One of the waitresses saw us as soon when we walked in and she said she'll be right with us. Waited for over 5 mins to get seated even though the restaurant is not busy. So I decided to walk over the Buffalo Wild Wings instead since my girls are hungry. At least they seated us as soon when we walked in. Never again will not come to Red Robin. Smh!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=40

I usually love Red Robin and am a huge fan of the chain. This location, however is worse than horrible. Twice now we have received agonizingly, mind numbingly slow service, cold food, and terrible value.  Top this off with an obnoxious waitress, and you have the perfect storm of terrible experience.

Jose C.,"Vallejo, CA",53,1,,1.0,8/31/2017,"**only put 1 star cause i couldnt put no star** So i went to this Red Robin because i was already in the mall with my 3 yr old daughter, amd i been there a long time ago and enjoyed it. Got seated right away then waited... waited.. waited for bout 15 min for our waitress to come and ask if we wanted drinks. Then waited 5 more minutes to take order (i ordered a burger and fries and my daughter ordered corndog bites) so 20 min into being there i noticed  3 families(white families) coming in (place wasnt busy) 2 families with 4+ ppl. Mind you we were the only colored ppl eatin. Well some how some way all 3 families get their food before us (mostly burgers). After waitin bout an hour and asking the waitress to check on our order 3 times mind you the second time i told her i just want my daughter's order out asap, We get our food. My burger(cheese already looked hardened)  and fries were cold my daughters food was warm. I sent mine back but my daughter was starving so she ate hers, i didnt eat cause didnt want to wait more. I spoke to manager and asked if it was a racial thing cause i see no other reason for our food to take so long and the fact the other families got their food so fast and they ordered same thing as me. He says its not cause they hire all kinds of people, then i asked why would no one bring me my food then? Especially since i had my daughter with me had no answer. He didnt charge me for my daughters food but honestly worse experience ive ever had, literally  felt like i was 100% discriminated against for no reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=40
Nikki L.,"Suisun City, CA",70,8,,1.0,1/12/2017,I have been to this Red Robin on several occasions. And I have to say the customer service is really bad. My last visit on 1/11/17 was probably the best service I have received. Unfortunately I went to lunch with my cousin and we both became ill. We shared both items we ordered. We ordered the chili con queso and the A1 peppercorn burger.  So I called today to inform the management of the problem. Again the customer service was horrible the first time I called.  I was placed on hold for over 15 minutes and never actually spoke to a manager. I hung up and called back and finally got to speak to a manager. The manager was polite and apologized for the problems. Needless to say I probably won't be visiting this Red Robin again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=40

Wait time is usually between 15-30 minutes for seating, especially during the holidays. But drinks will always come right away. Definitely try their onion rings, which they serve stacked up. Service is alright, definitely didn't receive that much love from our server but it was busy. Food took awhile to arrive (we did see it sit under the hot light for awhile before making its way on our table). Food didn't arrive hot, in fact, my mother had to send it back because it wasn't to her liking. But other than that everything was okay. Food isn't like ""wow amazing"" but it'll get the job done.

I normally go to Vacaville Red Robin but I've decided to give Fairfield Red Robin a chance. Overall issue is poor service.

As we sat there, more customers walked in. Unfortunately (?) for us, as soon as they arrived, a waitress walked past and sat those 2 groups before us. That waitress somewhat acknowledged us that we'd be seated next. Not a big deal, we weren't in a hurry. Next thing we knew, another group came in and a different waitress passed by to get them seated. Oh well, not a big deal... I guess? Guess what! Another set of people came in and the first waitress showed up to seat that set of people, too... Totally dismissing us! We sat there for a bit and looked at each other with our rumbly tummies echoing in unison... ""Yeah, let's go elsewhere..."", we thought to each other.

Once we got a booth table, I noticed pizza and other large scraps under the table. There's flags we're flying high but it was late and we decided to stay. Big mistake.  My husband ordered the Bruschetta Chicken sandwich ... he noticed the chicken had an odd taste after a couple of bites and looked at the sandwich - it was raw inside!  We told the server, who seemed nonchalant about it. Although she deducted the meal, we felt the situation could have been dealt more appropriately, such as having the manager come talk to us. In fact, I left my food as well but it wasn't deducted.  So, should you choose to eat at this place, please look closely at your meal.

It was fixed after we complained, but damn, it was horrible. Plus they had a leak from the ice machine that ran our into the dining area.

The only plus side to this visit was the waitress who was pregnant and actually worked harder than the man with dreads who just flips his hair after he seats the guests. What does he even do besides flip his hair and gives creepy looks to men he finds attractive? Our first initial visit it took them 15 minutes to seat us because no one was even at the host station to see if anyone was waiting to be seated. There were three cooks. Which I seemed plenty to man orders that came through when the restaurant didn't even have a lot of customers. But I guess not.

I visit Red Robin wherever I go (Seattle, California, Vegas) and even my home town of Fairfield. I must admit, even though I never thought I would, was the only bad one I've been too. It was terrible. When we got there, there was a sign on the door saying that they were closing early for maintenance and there was water on the floor as we walked in-- forgivable. However, most of us didn't eat our food. There was 6 people in our group and only one was pleased. The drinks had to be returned and we didn't bother with the food. We should have returned it, it was too hard to get someone to come over to our table.  This RR needs super help! Look at the ratings... and nearly 400 reviews.

First of all wait time for my party was over 30 min, pathetic and honestly there was 1 or 2 more parties with less than 4 people each ahead of me and half the restaurant ro this point is still open to seating. Our server never came to ask for drinks, he just dropped off silverware and came back 15min later to take our order and completely forgot that he never took our drink order. It gets worse, our DRINKS, just drinks took another 15min to get here and he had forgotten what half the drink orders were. They ran out of orange cream for my soda. Note: He's telling me this 20min after I ordered my drink. I think I'll stop here for the ranting because it kept going so Angel please step up your work performance I don't like to point fingers but when it's necessary I have to because I like Red Robin and would like some average service at least for the future if I ever do plan on going. On the good side (the only good thing in the review if you skipped ahead) the food was actually good and it's mever dissapointed so a thumbs up there for the Crispy Chicken Burger along with the other burgers ordered.

Dan W.,"Warrenville, IL",8,12,2,1.0,9/4/2017,"******ROACHES!!!!  Stay away from this place !!  Usually I don't put up a 1 star review but in this case I feel it necessary.  My parents were in town visiting from Chicago last weekend and we wanted to go to a decent dinner. We decided on Red Robin because we have been to them back home and it was always good .  We arrived at about 745 pm and waited to be seated. We then were taken to our table and placed our order within a few minutes. Then we waited... and waited .... and waited some more.  They were busy and I understand things happen, but it took almost an hour to get 4 burgers (which were warm) and fries (which were all cold). They were pretty stingy with the ""bottomless "" steak fries and we didn't even ask for more because we didn't want to have to wait again. Our waitress did not check on us once after the food came ..not even to bring the bill.  ****After our meal , I noticed a bug crawl out from the shared bench seat my dad was sitting on.. the bug kept coming closer to my dad so he swatted it away with his phone and it landed on the ground under the table. I realized that I was staring at a cockroach and immediately asked for a manager to come over. My family and i were sick to our stomachs realizing we had just eaten here.  It took about 5 minutes for the manager to finally come over. I showed her the roach and she started apologizing saying that because they are in a mall they get ""critters"" sometimes and she would have the restaurant sprayed that night.  The manager then grabbed the payment kiosk on the table, added a gratuity for the server to our check and charged us full price for the meal! I was sure she would do something besides apologize after what had just happened. But, NOTHING.   I  decided to try and let the restaurant know of the problem by calling the feedback hotline. When I finally spoke to someone  I explained what had happened and the terrible service we received . I asked for our bill to be credited back and not charged for our meal.  The guy on the phone said that wasn't a problem and I would be credited back within a few business days ... it's been a week and still nothing.  It's not the money that matters. THERE IS A SERIOUS MANAGEMENT ISSUE IN THIS RESTAURANT.  AND CLEANLINESS ISSUES OBVIOUSLY.   Nobody at the corporate level even seems to care at all.. nothing has been done to rectify the horrible experience my family and I had .

Chris G.,"Fairfield, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/1/2017,"There are so many things wrong with this place I don't know where to begin. This was my husbands only day off -after working for three weeks straight, so we decided to treat ourselves and our family to a nice meal. Before we walked in -from the sidewalk, I noticed how dirty their glass doors were! There were hand marks all over, from top to bottom. My first thought was maybe it is part of the decoration? As we got closer to the glass doors, it became clear that it was indeed greasy hand prints all over. I thought how gross, but maybe they had an energetic little one come in and maybe they hadn't had enough time to clean it all up?  Upon entering, there was no one there to greet us in the waiting area. We waited a few minutes. My kids began playing with their chalk boards. After some more time, I realized no one had heard or seen us walk in -so I approached the manager who was sitting directly across from the entrance ( he was filling out paperwork). I asked him if we needed to go over to the other side of the restaurant (where the entrance from the mall is) to be checked in and wait for a table. He got up immediately, and grabbed us a waitress. It was pretty empty inside.  As we're walking in -I notice dirty napkins laying all over the place. The carpet was very dirty. It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in days. Our table was sticky. All red flags but we wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Our waitress came by for drinks and to take our order. She never once stopped to pick up that dirty napkin that was laying right in her path. When I received my plate I noticed right away that the cucumbers were old. They looked like clear, green jelly. I picked them out and didn't say anything -because I did not want to complain. I go to add ranch and I notice that the lettuce is brown. Then see that the tomatoes also look old and colorless. As I am picking all the bad bits and pieces out, and mixing the lettuce around -I see hair. I pulled on it, and out came two long, blonde hairs. I called the waitress over. She went to grab the manager. My family and I had all lost our appetites. The fries looked like they had been reheated or re fried. They were dry and stale. We all decided not to eat. In that time that we waited for the manager to come, not once did our waitress come over to talk to us or to at least offer us a refill on our drinks.  After a few minutes go by , the manager finally came to our table. He offered me a new salad, I said no thanks - he offered me fries, I said no thanks. I couldn't imagine eating there anymore.  I told him to take the salad and burger that I had ordered off of my check. He did.  When the manager left our table, we started hearing the cooks hollering loudly and laughing. So disrespectful. The manager never apologized or explained anything to me about why it happened. No one ever came back to check on us. It was completely awkward for us and we all felt bad. We sat there for a few minutes trying to understand what was happening. It was incredibly ridiculous and not expected from such a nice looking restaurant. We decided to leave, but we were trying to take those charges for special sauces that never made it to our table off our bill so we called for our waitress but she did not come for another 3 minutes or so. We had already paid because at that point we were frustrated. All the ladies were turning the other way completely ignoring us.  Our total for this bad service and food was way unfair. It was a nightmare.  We took all the food in boxes because we paid for it -but tossed it as soon as we got home!  For half the price -we got jack in the box and ate that instead.  I felt that the manager should have offered a sincere apology and a discount for the entire check. They ruined our family time. We had so many other options but decided to give Red Robin a chance. This is newly remodeled restaurant and seemed like a good choice at the time -but we were very wrong. This place ruined our evening. The Manager here, really needs to get on top of this mess! Take some management classes and train his staff on customer service, have someone go around cleaning/vacuuming every single morning before opening, wiping all the doors and windows, have staff pick up any garbage they see, clean the tables with some sort of disinfectant, inspect their food, train staff and cooks on proper food handling, train staff how to properly handle these situations to stop customers from feeling uncomfortable and grossed out!  I strongly believe that Food/Health inspectors should randomly go and take a look at this place! The kiosk didn't even have paper to print our receipt, so I'll be double checking to make sure the waitress did not somehow add herself a tip.  $50 thrown away!

Aaron G.,"Fairfield, CA",6,14,17,2.0,12/28/2016,"(I will be updating each time I visit/have experiences at Red Robin--I'd love to see improvements here) Poor customer service overall. Some of the wait staff are just fine and dandy but they don't have sufficient coverage during rushes--even the hosts/hostesses look like they can't handle seating properly. They need training in how to manage seating and faster table bussing. I don't understand how there's so many staff but they look mismanaged and inefficient during the busy hours and rushes. Tables are left uncleared while people wait too long. Now the food--most of the time it comes to me cold or warm for the dozen or so times I came to this place. Especially the fries--cold (I order second round and then they come to the table hot--that always does the trick). Asking for your burger well done means there's still pink in the middle. I think they use frozen burgers since that can only explain why the meat is still pink but clearly well done on the outside. I don't make much of a fuss but I've been with friends that won't accept cold food or pink meat. Menu items are great and diverse but again, temperature of the food is a bit disappointing. I still come here because the food is (still) good and some servers are friendly but the overall management of this restaurant needs some serious overhaul.

James R.,"Suisun City, CA",168,496,658,1.0,6/28/2015,"Man what happened to this place? Red Robin use to be pretty consistently good, but boy did something go wrong. I came here last night with a party of six. The place has been remodeled and looks fantastic, unfortunately that's the only good thing to say about it. They sat us on the outside area that comes into the mall. I personally didn't have a problem with it, but the lady never even asked us if that was ok (some people don't like people watching them eat ya know?).  The waitress we got was absolutely terrible. Let's lot of what exactly went down. First off the lady took forever to get everyone their drinks. I'm talking close to 15 minutes to get a drink. Refills were pretty nonexistent. We asked several times to get more water and lemonade. She would say yes she was on her way, but ten minutes would go by with no new drink...like cmon. Another one of our friends waited almost half an hour for water and she said all the glasses were getting clean. Total BS. We got two appetizers. Mozzarella sticks and onion rings. The mozzarella sticks were delicious I will say, but when she brought the onions rings there was a slight problem. They were not stacked because she said the stacking tool was gone or they didn't have enough. Wtf?! First the dirty glasses then this? She didn't even attempt to stack them and sloppily out them on the plate. The food was terrible. My girlfriend ordered the clucks and fries and the chicken was absolutely dry. I ordered the new genisys burger and it looked nothing like the picture and wasn't that great (as seen in my photo). The fries were all soggy too like they'd been left out too long not to mention they barely give any fries anymore regardless that's it's ""bottomless."" The big kicker here was my friend can't eat any kind of pork product. When his burger arrived lo and behold he had bacon on there. The waitress brought it back two minutes later and said they put a new bun, new lettuce and cheese on it but removed the bacon. Whoah lady! My friends religious background means no bacon. And the bacon grease had seeped all over the meat and she thought it was ok. We sent it back to get a brand new one, but it took over 25 minutes to get it...absolutely ridiculous. When we paid the bill we all agreed we were never coming back. My friend asked the lady why the food was so bad. Was it a new cook? The lady replied they were short staffed and that if we knew any cooks to tell them to apply. Wow. That's all wow. I hope she enjoyed the $2 dollar tip. My real tip to her is to find another job ASAP. So overall never coming here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=60

I told them I don't keep receipts so they sent me another email saying they will contact this Red Robin to fix whatever is wrong. That's all..... *eye roll* Shitty ass franchise, no wonder why the restaurants are the way they are. Stay clear!  I came here about a year ago and got stuck with a new waiter. It took about 30 minutes just to place my drink order and then after an hour of waiting for my food, I walked out. I called the manager and he was upset that I left because just as I left, they brought my food out. He offered me a free meal so I decided to go back and try it out again but they ended up screwing up my food.   Fast forward to today, I was at the mall with my 3 year old and decided to try Red Robin again. What a mistake. We got seated right away and it took about 10 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us and take our order. It took another 35-40 min to get our food. When we got our food, my burger was pink. Like, raw. It took me another 10 min to get someone's attention just to get my burger remade. By this time, I had to pick up my 5 year old from school so I asked them to make it to go. The manager brought my burger out 20 min later and said she was sorry. I got my bill and I was charged twice for my burger and had to bring it to my waitress' attention.

She goes on to tell me that it's better to order online.  My main issue here is the lack of customer service. Not everything needs to be online, almost every other location I've been to offers great service. This was disappointing. I worked in the service industry and I know it's not easy and the most rewarding career and I dont want to break anyone's balls here and maybe the issue is above the staff here, maybe it's chain trying to adapt to technology. My advice here is stick to the basics. Have problem solvers and don't let people wait 10-15 minutes to order take out.  I left without placing an order, opting to go someplace else.

Kids pizza.    It's a shame because the Vacaville RR is completely different everytime we go there.  Hot food and good service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=120
Carol T.,"Fairfield, CA",0,33,8,3.0,1/3/2016,"Love that this is located in the Mall, makes is convenient for pre- or post movie bites.  Hit and miss with service though.   Careful on trying to special order dishes - 50/50 chance that they get my Son's cheese pizza no sauce order correct from the kiddos menu.  And while I can appreciate new plate ware, was it really necessary to cut the salad and soup portions down so much with the change?   The newly updated interiors are nice though.  Gives a fresh modern vibe.   **** Last note, and request for Red Robin.  You put those fancy appetizer, drink order machines on the table.... But we have to sit here for 5 - 10 min once we get here for our waitress to come over to take our drink and appetizer order to use it.... Defeats the purpose wouldn't you say?   Can you have those activated as part of the initial seating process please?  ****",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=120
AJ Y.,"Petaluma, CA",0,4,2,2.0,4/17/2016,"I'm giving this location two stars because I have had decent experiences in the past. Unfortunately, our last visit ended before we were seated. Rather sad for the restaurant...they missed out on our large order, plus tips and future business.  We were given a wait time and then waited twice what they had said. This is due to the hostess writing a 5 next to our name. When she asked my husband ""how many children"" and he said 5, she forgot to record the two adults also present. So, that should have been a ""7"". Didn't have to be a big deal. Everyone makes mistakes. But when I asked about a table that was vacant, the hostess was snotty and defensive.  Then when my husband said ""never mind"", she *shrugged* and did not offer an apology for the inconvenience, etc.  I will not give our hard-earned money to a place that has that representation at their front desk.   Good news is that Fuddruckers is a short drive away.  That's where we ate that night and had a great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=120

I'm a fan of Red Robin in general and I couldn't imagine one location being so much worse than others. I was wrong.  When we arrived, there was a couple ahead of us, waiting on the hostess who was taking an order of some kind on the phone. Had she acknowledged the 4 of us it wouldn't have phased me but we were all standing there kind of confused instead.  After we were seated the waitress seemed to be engaging and kind so I didn't think much of the previous interaction. Unfortunately, after we ordered things began to fall apart. It took quite a while just to get our chips and salsa. When it arrived, the chips were soaked in grease, about an inch of which had collected on the bottom of the bowl. The guac and salsa also had a strange, sour taste to them. Our entrees took twice as long and were just as lack-luster. Our salads were not the normal size I receive at other locations, this was much smaller (not worth the $11) and there were more onions than there was lettuce. The lettuce itself was soggy and discolored.  TLDR: the food and service at this location is no where near the quality of other Red Robin establishments.

So we skimmed through the drink menu feeling a little rushed and just ordered a freckled lemonade, a purple lemonade and a kids lemonade. He then tells us ""ok! I am not your server so I cant get those for you, so I will just go ahead and put in a water."" Wtf? Really??? What was the point of that?  A couple minutes later our server then came by took our orders, and told us our drinks were on the way. She was very nice but was not attentive to us at all. She would ask how we were doing and when we answered ""good, but can we get...."" she cuts us off before we can finish and says ""great! Let me know if you guys need anything!"" And walks away so fast that we dont even get a chance to stop her. We had to ask for everything ourselves! Refills, more fries (bottomless), more salad (bottomless). Not once did she ask ""would you like a refill?"" Or more fries?"" When I did get my refill, I could see another server asking each table in front of ours asking if they had ordered a purple lemonade with my drink in her hand. She finally got to our table and before she could ask I just looked at her in frustration and said ""yes! That is mine."" She apologized and said it was put in for the wrong table. A few seconds later, another guy came by our table with another purple lemonade and said ""oh, you got it already?"" And then walked away like I was the one who made him bring the drink. I then saw him hand it out free to another table around the corner.

Stefani T.,"Madera, CA",0,26,,1.0,6/19/2016,"This was THE worst restaurant experience I have had in quite some time.  I thought the Applebee's in the Solano Town Center Mall was bad, but Red Robin managed to outdo them last night. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at first, it was after all 8:30 on a  Saturday night at the mall, so I figured we'd have to wait a little bit.  Plus we were a party of 5 with a small child.  However, the hostess stand was unattended when we got there, and it took at least 5 minutes before we even got a ""someone will be right with you"" from a passing server.   5 more minutes passed until someone did actually come over and seat us.   Even after pressing the ""call server"" button on the little computer thing on the table, we didn't see a server or even get offered so much as water for the next fifteen minutes.  Just as we were about to leave (after watching the couple at the table behind us walk out, presumably for the same reason), the server finally showed up.  We ordered drinks and food all at the same time, hoping to expedite the process.  My friend's little niece had also asked our server very politely for some crayons for her coloring page, which she never got.  I had to get up and go over to the STILL unmanned hostess stand and get them myself.  TWENTY minutes later, the drinks show up, and one of them was wrong. One of my friends ordered the bottomless root beer float.  The glass was maybe half full, with about a quarter of that being root beer. It looked pretty putrid. We're just about finished with our drinks, still no food.  Once again, we were considering just paying for those and leaving, since it was approaching 9:30 at this point, but we were so damn hungry by then we waited.  Two of our meals arrived, not brought by our original server.  We still had no napkins or silverware in front of us.  I asked this server if we could please get some silverware and such, she basically dismissed me, set down the other meal and walked off.  Thanks. My friend seated to my left got his burger, and it had been sitting under a heat lamp so long the bottom bun was completely soggy with burger juice.  My other friend's sandwich was almost cold.  I will say that the food, once we got it, was the best part, and even that wasn't anything to rave about.  We finally got silverware and napkins, unwrapped, and plopped down in front of me on a plate, which I guess it was up to me to distribute to everyone at the table.  Not once did a server ask us how everything was, did we want more drinks, one of my friends couldn't even get a refill on her water.   The place looked disgusting.  Tables weren't being bussed, garbage and food all over the floor by the tables from kids, fruit flies buzzing around.  When it came time to pay, one of us had to go get the check ourselves.  Then when we paid, we had to take the credit card up to the server station ourselves, and there was a LINE to do so.  Our group was waiting to leave as our friend who was treating waited to get his credit card back.  He was just standing there, for 5 minutes or more.  I finally got fed up, walked over and asked him, ""Do they still have your credit card?""  He said yes.  I hollered at the 4 or 5 people milling around, ""How long does it take to run a credit card??  Let's go!""  I don't like being pushed to have to speak to people like that, but the service in this location is beyond awful.  However, this was what was necessary to finally get his card back, as it magically appeared all of a sudden with the receipt.  Not sure about you, but I get a little suspicious when my credit card disappears behind the scenes for that long. The odd thing was, it really wasn't THAT crowded in there, so I'm not sure what was keeping the servers so tied up other than poor staffing and even poorer management.  This will now be the second restaurant in this same mall that I will never visit again.  I don't know if it's the mall management, or Red Robin themselves, but this location needs a serious overhaul, and fast.  I've eaten here previously and it was decent all around, not sure what happened, but judging by other reviews on here, this wasn't a one time thing last night. If I hadn't been with a group of friends, my patience would have run out much sooner.  It's pretty bad when the 4 year old was able to keep her cool better than I was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=140
Roberta K.,"Vacaville, CA",2,19,5,2.0,3/3/2017,A friend and I decided to grab a quick bite to eat after returning something at the mall. We decided to sit in the bar at Red Robin thinking the service would be faster and grab a quick meal before having to pick up my kids from school. We sat down right away and drinks were ordered and delivered reasonably fast-about 5-8min. But we ordered our food and waited 40-45 minutes before I got up and said something. Two other tables of 1 to 2 people were given their food even though we were there first. We had not ordered anything complicated just a burger and a chicken burger but our food never came and we were running out of time and the store wasn't even busy. The food was given to us in Togo boxes because I told them I had no more time to sit there and eat. The manager was very nice and apologized for the wait as other people were starting to get upset as well. The server never really came back.

Anyway, she took our orders and brought me back a soda that tasted foul, then she disappeared.

The service is consistently terrible - waitresses who could care less and management that needs to step up and get their employees in gear. This last visit was a to-go order (we assumed just call it in and skip the tremendous wait times). Had to call three times. First call I was on hold for over eight minutes. Hung up and called back, the woman who answered asked to put me on hold again. I said that I had been waiting and no one picked up. She gave the excuse of them being busy, offered no apology and continued to insist to put me on hold.  The length of time she spent arguing with me she could have just taken my order. I said forget it and hung up. My husband decided to call and try his luck (I am currently pregnant and my sweet husband wanted to make sure my craving was fulfilled). He was able to place our order with another gentleman who answered pretty painlessly. He got clucks and fries and I got the french dip sandwich which we were told would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. Went to pick up our order (arrived 25 minutes after placing the order) and was directed to the bar. With one bartender making drinks she was also required to handle the to go orders and package them herself. After waiting 10 more minutes our food was brought to us. Order was correct but I received a laughable amount of au jus sauce. Asked the bartender for a bit more and she got an attitude. Acted like she was majorly inconvenienced by my request for more. We got home and began to eat, our food was what we wanted but again we were disappointed in the serving size of their ""bottomless"" fries.  Again, a laughable amount.

The last two times I went here the service sucked and I think I know the problem.  The servers who are mostly younger women think they deserve a big tip for what I see as mediocre service at best.

Used to be my favorite dine in burger joint to a place I'll never go to again. Make the trip to Vacaville instead and that's my recommendation without even going there, this location is that bad.

My husbands food was just as bad. The people sitting at the booth behind us were also disturbed by their food and sent it back telling the waiter ""it does not taste right"". The waiter tried to make it up to them but they refused anymore food. I could go on forever about the fruit salad. Do not order it. It's some very sub par canned fruit and sliced apples. I've got a picture of it.  All in all if you're contemplating going here, seriously don't bother. It is a pretty bad disappointment.

Who is running this place? He or she needs to look at all the business that they are losing due to this new renovated restaurant being consistently filthy, cold food, dry drink glasses, crappy servers and just down right a hot ass mess.

Michelle R.,"Oakland, CA",158,148,113,2.0,7/30/2017,"I really love Red Robin but they need to tighten up the execution of the food orders. I'm giving them 2 stars because our waitress Angela was great and she pulled up my rewards account for me so that I can use my email coupon. I'm beginning to think the cooks can't read. I go to three other locations (Vacaville, Concord, and Pleasanton)and this location is the worst of them all. The food never comes out right. It never fails. Today, even the machine that takes your payment wasn't even working. Now, the waiters are not the problem but then by the time they come back to make your order right, your food has gotten even colder (and it's not like the food is hot in the first place). It seems like the helpers never come back when you ask them for something. Because the things you ask for when you order never come the first time. And it can be difficult getting help when your waitress is busy. Today, there was a strawberry in my water. I ordered a BBQ burger, they didn't put BBQ sauce on the burger, I ordered a salad with my burger, they brought out fries. So irritating. I hope this review reaches someone in power that can change this. Serving burgers shouldn't be this hard to do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=100

The New look they did to the red ribon looks amazing: inside and out! Bar area, looks really nice as well as the nice cushion the seats had to them. Big Flat Screens everywhere throughout the restaurant.  Food: The food was good, the mozzarella sticks aren't the best. But when I ordered the BBQ whisky BBQ it was delicious. The fries are still bottomless, but you can't order them before you food gets to the table.  Service: Service was pretty bad, the lady rarely came to our table to check on how we were doing. The table needed to be picked up from old dishes and they were just sitting....sitting...and sitting! I would ask for more water, she would walk before I could even ask for something else in need for!

Mind you my burger was not what I had even ordered , it was supposed to have the fried jalapeños on it , the server said oh I'll be right back with some so you can add it on. Where we were sitting there is glass where you can see the expo line & literally watched the server drop them all over the expo line scoop them back up with her hands and bring them to me & acted like I didn't see her doing so. So by this time I asked for a manager and walked out because it seemed like the manager didn't even care! So we tried to come a second time only because my girlfriend wanted to again before a movie , and we literally waited at the front to be seated for about a good 30 mins.

I've been here a couple of times in the past five years and the quality and customer service seem to be declining quite rapidly.  I'm usually not one to complain so I gave this Red Robin a couple of chances but maybe I shouldn't have. There were a couple of encounters where I asked for sweet potato fries instead of steak fries but always ended up getting steak fries.  Every time I've been here, service has been really slow and it looks like the waiters don't know what they're doing. There were even times we had to remind our servers that we've been waiting to order after maybe 30 minutes and once we finally ordered it took another 45 minutes to get our food. My sister had to remind a server we were waiting a while for our food and it had actually been sitting out the whole time. The last time I went here, I was with my boyfriend and another party of two were seated before us. Once we were finally seated, our servers never got to us. I heard the people on the left and right of us complaining about everything. While waiting, I decided to look at the yelp reviews and saw someone got food poisoning from this place.  I've never left a place before ordering but I guess there's a first time for everything.

Two pieces of wilted celery sat on the plate, with bunch of overly greasy chips. There was barely any dip given compared to all the chips that you were served. The actual burgers we ordered were decent, my friend seemed to enjoy hers, and her sweet potato fries. I got a turkey burger that fell apart by the time I had eaten half of it.

It actually took a full 30 minutes to get our drinks.  First the server forgot to even ring them in, then she came back to tell us they were out of the wine I ordered, so I chose something else to drink.   We watched the drinks get made and then the bartender sat them down on the service bar and went back to standing around doing nothing.   Our table was about 10 feet from the bar.  She saw us.  She knew they were our drinks.   She didn't give a shit.   I was just about to get up and grab them myself when the waitress came out of hiding and picked them up.     The food took forever and came out wrong. My boyfriends BACON burger came out cold, overcooked.... Oh and without bacon.   And the fries (all four or five of them) tasted about a week old.   My salad was missing the bread, which I had to ask for, and when I finally got it, it was so hard I could have used it as a doorstop.   The absolute best part of this phenomenal experience were the lazy bitchy girls behind the bar.  They did nothing but talk shit about customers very loudly.    All the while every other table around us was dirty and had been dirty for over half an hour.    (See awesome not-so-incognito photos I took).  Get off your lazy asses and do something!!    Worst service, horrible food, filthy tables/environment, laziest, bitchiest bartenders I've ever seen in my life.   Which is saying a lot considering I've been a bartender for 18 years and I've pretty much seen it all.  Just AWFUL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=100

They took a long time to seat us when the restaurant had more staff than customers. The booth we were assigned was wet, had a sweaty smell to it and it took around 5 minutes for a server to be assigned to us. I can understand if a restaurant is crowded and it takes time for a server to be assigned but it doesn't make sense when the restaurant is mostly empty. To the servers credit, she was mostly prompt with the service and hence I settled for this rating.

bcast b.,"Solano, CA",121,67,32,4.0,7/26/2015,"Red Robin had messaged me personally about the bad experience I shared here and they invited me to come back at their expense. First of all, I'd like to thank them for caring and reaching out. I really didn't expect all that so good job there guys. To be fair I really took the time to give RR another chance so I've been back twice, once on a weekday and again on a busy Sunday.  Both times I had the same waitress and I must say she is one of the best I've had at RR, her name is Esperanza. She really hustles and makes sure you're enjoying your visit.  On the weekday, we went in for lunch and it wasn't too busy. Drink refills were adequate and we requested fries to come before the meal so we could have something to snack while waiting for the entree. The food came out fast so we didn't have to wait.  Big plus there. We also had several fries refills no prob.  On the weekend, ordered the same meal but with broccoli this time. We got a bowl of broccoli early and fast. AND It was piping hot! THIS is the RR I expect. Thank you lunch staff and Esperanza. It did get very busy there afterward and the kitchen unfortunately got backed up. We only got 1 broccoli refill and it didn't arrive until we were full.  Esperanza did what she could and was very honest and apologetic so I appreciate that.  To fix this, I think the kitchen may need to make more of the refill items available for the servers to fill.  Also for peak hours perhaps have more staff.  The new men's room layout is amazing. It finally makes sense in there. And it smelled nice. So far A+ for the renovation.  With a good server and a little patience, you can still enjoy and get your Red Robin fix.  But weekdays have much better service over weekends.  I still got a little irked by one of the intense waitresses but it looks like she works hard as well. She may need some training in caring about all patrons as valued guests and not as in-laws. Thank you RR. I know you guys strive for excellence.  You guys did good enough and I enjoyed both visits.  But pls pls get your refill game on point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=100

Ava M.,"Benicia, CA",18,4,,1.0,10/8/2016,"This rating is mostly directed toward the Manager that was on the floor but clearly didn't feel like all of the customers were important. My husband and I wanted to take our 3yr old out for lunch after having a nice time at a near by pumpkin patch. Since we are Red Robin Royalty card members we thought we would stop at this Red Robin and have a nice lunch. We were seated right away and they didn't appear to be too busy, so I was shocked when we just kept being passed by and ignored. We waited 15min before getting up to explain the girl up front that we have been sitting for 15 min and no one has even come by to say ""Hi"". She told my husband that she would get someone to come help us right away. Another group that was seated next to us, having the same issue, was at least told by the manager who working the floor that he would have someone right with them....and then just passed us by. We waited a little longer and as it become evident that no one intended to come help us we got up and left (as did the group having the same problem). The best part of it all was as we were leaving we looked back through the ""Patio"" seating and saw the Manager who had ignored us clearing our lemurs off the table and acting like he was the hurt party in all this.  I have had mostly bad experiences at the Red Robin as of the past year. While I have had a few good experiences (all of which have been in the evening), they unfortunately do not out weigh the bad.

Deborah H.,"Fairfield, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/23/2017,"Visited tonight with the hubby. We entered via the parking lot entrance as two employees exited from a side door conducting a nosy profanity-laced conversation including the F word. Walked inside to find more dirty tables than clean. There were literally more dirty tables than tables with diners. When we told the hostess we wanted to sit in the bar, she handed us our menus and said we could find our way. When we arrived at the bar we were seated at a table that had not been wiped off. When my husband asked the bartender to wipe the table he got some attitude going, grabbed a rag, made a swipe at the table and left us to sit on the last patron's crumbs...next to a dirty dish-covered table to our left that was never bussed during our entire meal. The table of four seated to our right had to reorder missing food items more than once, and due to a lack of attention had to get out of their seats to locate a server for help to rectify their multiple food issues. We began with iced tea and the pretzel bite appetizer, obviously deep-fried, over done on one side and undercooked on the other, with runny lumpy cold cheese sauce for dipping. I ordered the chicken caesar wrap with a cup of clam chowder. The wrap was executed without garnish but otherwise perfect. The soup was served at room temperature and sent back. In addition, the soup was not served in a cup but instead served in a vessel the size of a ranch dressing side. Hubby ordered a cheeseburger which he said was okay, came with bottomless fries. He wasn't offered additional fries until we were finished with our meal. We were never offered iced tea refills. As we were leaving Hubby mentioned to the bartender there were ten dirty tables just in our area. The bartender glanced around and said ""yeah that's about right."" Hubby asked if they had a busser and was told they did, but the bartender had no idea where he was. Next time Hubby wants a good burger we'll need to find a cleaner establishment to visit.

She continued to enter on the terminal, checked on her table again and then walked away. By this time it had been about 7-8 minutes that I'd been sitting at the bar waiting. I was so turned off by the complete lack of customer service I decided to walk out. A sorry and a water would have helped the situation.  As soon as I asked if I could speak to a manager, the bartender walked past me quickly followed by a couple of other staff members giving me a smirk.

A couple of months ago my husband and I experienced a meal where there were little black gnats flying all around the table and landing in our food and drinks. The server and manager apologized and said they were having a problem with pest control in the mall and were trying to have it remedied. They comped our meal and were very apologetic. We were pretty grossed out though and didn't really want to eat our food.  We just went back with two of our kids yesterday. They are remodeling and it seemed that the gnat problem was remedied. Nope. It was better but they were not gone. We had a few flying around at our table. My clucks and fries were cold, my lettuce under my fries was brown, my son's meal was cold and there was a long brown hair on his fries. YUCK!  When the waitress came to refill my drink she asked if everything was good and I said no, I don't think she expected that answer because she took a double take. I showed her the hair.

My hamburger, which I requested to be medium rare was actually burned and well done, not to mention the soggy bun from siting too long. The french fries were cold and they looked like only half order each, just old fries tossed in our plates.

Now I understand that this location is being remodeled and all but does the service have to suck as well? So we sit at the bar and the lady asked us what would like to drink? I ordered two beers and a shot. She said ok, poured the beers and then disappeared. I mean she never came back! So as I'm looking around her co-worker approaches and ask if she could help. I re-ordered my shot and asked where was the original bartender in which she replied. I don't know, I think she forgot about you and went to run food. Alrighty then. So after it seemed like forever she shows back up and asked if we were ready to order. We placed the order and she turned to us as she was typing in the order and laughed. She mentioned something about her log in number and that the system didn't recognize her. She walked off and I assumed she went to take care of whatever was going on with her log in and still place our order. Well I must say we sat for about and half hour not including the time we had already been there. The guy sitting in the back of us came in after we sat down as well as others and they all received their food! Ok something is very wrong here. She delivered her food to other tables but ours was no where to be seen. She even came back into the bar joking and laughing, but with no food and explanation why? Just as we started to get a manager and cancel the order, she finally brought our food which was unsatisfactory. My fries were ice cold and my husbands chicken was cold and his salad looked pitiful and thrown together. I also want to point out that he asked if he could have his chicken grilled to which he got a no response. Now I have worked in the same industry for years and have been told by many managers that if we have the ingredients to make what the guest request, then we do it. I can't believe that Red Robin has to just fry everything and can't put chicken on the grill instead. Needless to say we refused the food and she removed it from our bill, but I have to say that if I were her. Because it was her fault all the way and I told her as much. She simply forgot to put our order in the computer and instead of making it right by apologizing and possibly getting the manager involved. She thought by bringing us cold, dry food to two ""drunk"" people at the bar that it was going to fly pass us. We only had 1 beer and I had the shot. I would have comped the entire bill and or offered fresh food or something. We will not be returning and to think I had never been to a Red Robin before and now that I have had such crappy service, I won't give it another shot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=160

In regards to the food, they tend to load the burgers with mayo, BBQ sauce, or whatever sauce you get which makes them slippery and falls apart easily. Tip: Ask to have it cut the burger in half. It doesn't fall apart as easily. In my experience the fries have never been great. They're either soggy or not very hot. I like my fries crispy and warm thank you very much. As far as taste, it'll hit the spot if you're really craving a burger, just don't expect anything spectacular. The service is just okay. The waiters don't really seem to want to be there. This isn't related to the service, but the last time I was there the forks and knives were really gross and needed to be cleaned again. So I suggest you check those before using them.

After being seated my and my nephew waited 10 minutes to have our dirty table cleaned and then an extra 15 minutes to have our order taken. (Nearly in an empty environment mind you.) I ordered a $13 dollar burger. Nothing special just well done with cheddar cheese. My nephew ordered spaghetti with shrimp. He asked the waitress if it could be made al dente. The waitress promptly looked at my nephew as if he had two heads. After taking the time to explain to the waitress what cooking something al dente means, I went ahead and ordered a beer.  My beer arrived almost 20 minutes later room temp and almost flat. My 24 year old nephew asked if he could take a sip and of course I obliged. Another waiter saw what happened while cleaning up someone else's dirty table that another customer had already sat down at. Immediately stopped and took a B-line to our table and grabbed my beer that I ordered and very rudely scolded us telling us that she will not have minors drinking in her restaurant, and will no longer serve alcohol at our table. After my nephew went to his car and another 15 minutes gone by without so much as being asked for a different drink, he showed the licence to the manager, got into a small tiff with her and was actually YELLED at by a female member of management.

Eric A.,"Vallejo, CA",654,234,46,3.0,12/8/2013,"Just right off the bat, the following are the things I like about this place: decent service, bottomless fries, that tower of onion rings though, and the Irish milkshake. Those things aside, this is another one of your run of the mill diners that I only seem to hit up when I'm the mall with a large amount of friends. Out there, you've got the king of chain diners, the one and only Denny's. At the bottom of the barrel, you've got Applebees... ugh, I feel my stomach turning already, just mentioning that place. Then you've places like Red Robin's. Also a diner, but they seem to have a particular specialty in the area of burgers. Crack open their menu and you'll find a bevy of all sorts of burgers. I've had a couple of burgers here. While nicely sized, they never seem to come out just right. They always tend to come out on the dry side. I've ordered medium rare and I once even attempted rare... but alas, the end result was the same. Burger tasted alright though, and no ill effects on my digestive system, so that's always a plus. Like I mentioned at the onset, there's a few things I like about this place. Though on somewhat of a downside, they a little on the slow side when it comes to the bottomless fries. Still, gotta love that tower of onion rings and that Irish milkshake. I guess if I ever had to choose between this or Denny's... I might still end up at Denny's for nostaglia's sake. That being said, Red Robin is an alright choice. Just... you know... never settle for Applebees. And I'm out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=200

We sat there for 15 minutes with no one bringing our drinks, letting us know they'd be with us, NOTHING and there were open tables everywhere, not like they were busy. So I asked the hostess if I could speak to a manager, and they said he'd be right with me. We waited and he never showed up. Finally about 30 minutes later a waitress showed up and took our order. We waited another 5 minutes and still no drinks. We wasted 35 minutes there with little to no service. We walked out. I doubt they noticed or cared. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!

Stacy N.,"Fairfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/26/2017,First time coming to this location and their customer service is not good at all. Slow service since I first walked through the front door. There was no host at the front and had to wait along with other customers. Once I was seated I had to wait again just for the waiter to take my order and took even longer for our food to come out. The simpliest thing like a milkshake I order didnt get to my table until maybe 15 minutes. My waiter did not provide any napkins and utensil for our food. Waiting and waiting still no one coming by so I had to walked up to asked someone. By far this is the worst experience I've had anywhere. Looking around most waiters are working slow compare to the amount of customers they have. These workers need to speed up and check on their tables more often or they need to hire more people working every day. This is a spot located inside the mall and they should expect a decent amount of customers walking in on a daily basis. Food taste decent but customer service need to be worked on. Not only the service was very very poor they also need to maintance the women's restroom. It smelled bad and is definately in need of air vent or a freshener.  I do not recommend going to this location and rather go a different location or another restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=240

I was about to barf when i saw a dried on piece of lettuce stuck on our fork plus little bits of food on our knives. Yikes. We ordered the onion tower, no plates were given. We had to eat our food on top of napkins. Server walked by like that was no big deal. The burgers themselves were okay. Fries were on the skimpy side. I wanted to ask for more fries since they always advertise them as bottomless, but I just wanted to get outta there as soon as possible. Didn't really have much service either. The cherry on top of this crummy and dirty experience was our server asking us to fill out a survey at the end, give her good reviews or else she'll get written up and lose her job. It just got really awkward after that. Once she left, we just payed on the tablet and bolted outta there as soon as we could. Did not fill out the survey either.

First, out of 3 place settings, one knife and 2 forks were dirty.  I don't mean inspect with a magnifying glass dirty, but very obvious dirty.  They were replaced when they brought our soft drinks. Second, after drinking about 1/3 of her soft drink, I could see garbage in her glass.  No, not back wash, and we hadn't received our food as yet.  It was replaced. Third, when our burgers and fries arrived, the fries were a mix of medium hot and warm fries.  It was as if they put hot fries over leftover fries and served them after a 10 min wait. Forth, and the final, two of the burgers that were ordered ""Well Done"" came out Medium, and the one burger that was ordered ""Medium Well"" came out medium rare, with emphasis on the rare, cool, middle of the burger. The server was apologetic and offered to fix the burgers.  No thanks.  The manager came over to apologize and took one burger off the ticket.  My son and I ate our burgers, my wife couldn't eat hers at all and wouldn't take a replacement meal from ANY restaurant, let alone one that has shown this type of food preparation.

S. P.,"Suisun City, CA",0,45,23,1.0,6/18/2016,"I give up on this place; it's just been consistently bad every time I've gone lately. Most recently, I asked for a booth and was seated near the bar- which was fine. The server that was helping me seemed distracted, which isn't the worse part. She brought out an appetizer but no utensils, and when the food was brought out, told me that I would need to wait for any sauce to go with the fries. I thought they were suppose to ask you that before hand but whatever.  Now.. On to the worse part. I understand fully well that fruit flies are common around a bar (wine, sweet drinks); unfortunately red robin does not have this under control. When a bug inevitably landed in my sauce, I calmly pointed it out to the waitress and politely asked for a replacement. Throughout the time I was eating, I was waving my hand to keep the little bugs away. Instead of apologizing or offering to give me another seat, the server simply agreed about the bugs and never checked on me or refilled my water again. As a result, I ended up paying electronically and leaving. I completely understand that they are a busy restaurant but I've received consistently crappy service so many times from them that this review just had to be written.

The only reason I'm even giving stars is for the manager who went out of his way for us and the host who did everything she could to accommodate us. We had trouble getting a table, but it wasn't the hosts fault it was another host who sat people who had just walked up at the table the original host was saving for us. We waited a total of 25 minutes. The manager came out and gave us a free appetizer and gave us an awesome huge booth. I mentioned once to the host it was my sisters birthday and once to the manager,  Our server was nonexistent. We finally finished paid and left on the way out the manager asked if they sang happy birthday to her. I told them no they didn't and I don't even know who our server was. Three different people came to our table for drinks to drop off the food and then to drop the bill. We were HALFWAY down the mall when the manager ran up behind us and gave us a gift card for our bad experience and I just thought that was the sweetest thing. Not the gift card but the fact he didn't give up on us because we walked out the door he chased us down! That's an awesome manager!!

I hung up and tried calling again however no one answered so I keep calling and same thing, no response. When I finally got ahold of them they put my on hold again and I didn't even have a chance to say anything. When I finally got off hold the man on the phone told me he's going to put me on hold but I cut him off and said I'm not going to be on hold anymore and if he can just take my order now. I was just upset that I was being passed around playing phone tag just for some onion rings! He took my order and that was that but what made me mad was there was no one in the restaurant so why was I being on hold?? I only know this because I work in the mall and my coworker passed by the place when she was picking up her food from Buffalo Wild Wings and she told me that there was no one in there.

Paulamertha A.,"Suisun City, CA",287,472,639,1.0,9/21/2012,"A friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat here earlier this week (on a weekday). We've been here several times in the past with no big problems; however, there was a bunch of stuff that irked me this particular night that we went. First and foremost, the hostess saw that I'm using crutches and that I have a walking boot on, but when it came time for her to lead us to our table, she basically took off so it was hard for me to keep up with her. Luckily my friend asked her to slow up and pointed towards me. She stopped so I could catch up, but she didn't apologize or anything, just smiled. That was the first thing that rubbed me the wrong way about that night. Our waitress came by quickly to ask us what we wanted to drink; however, it took her FOREVER to come back and take our orders! The place was NOT packed, so I felt like there was no logical reason for the service to be so damn slow!  My friend & I both ordered garlic fries, but when out meal was brought out to us, our fries looked completely different. Usually it comes with garlic (duh), shredded cheese, and parsley (I believe). His had everything on it and mine just looked like they quickly threw on garlic on it before it was brought out to me. I usually don't nit pick at stuff, but for some reason that bothered me but I couldn't complain because the waitress disappeared once again. She was nowhere to be found until she saw that our fries were low, when we were almost done with our burgers. As if our dining experience couldn't get any worse, when she brought our refill of fries, she pretty much just threw them on the table and immediately walked to the people sitting at the table behind us (they were waiting such a long time that they just told her that they weren't going to eat there). The only time she was attentive to us was when it came time to pay. I was already out of water long before I finished my burger, but since she dropped the bill off and since I was still somewhat picking at fries, that's when she wanted to give me a refill on my water. I'm honestly very disappointed with my latest experience at this Red Robin location. There weren't a lot of guest dining here, yet the service was slow as hell! On top of that, I felt like the hostess was rude and inconsiderate when she clearly saw that I'm temporarily disabled. It just makes me wonder what the hell does she do when there are people with permanent disabilities. The waitress was slow, not really attentive to us, and I felt like she was rude since she threw our fries at us.

After actually getting our water our orders were taken.  We waited more than thirty minutes and when our food came out orders were wrong. We ate and while eating no one came to see if we needed anything, we were out of water from our FIRST drink for about twenty minutes. We sat while our waitress continually went past us without looking at us or asking if we needed anything. Asked her to speak to the manager and she never even brought him to us so we had to get him ourselves. Told him about our service and all he had to say was sorry continually and that he would get our tickets. Took him thirty minutes to do that. Other tables were complaining for poor service and wrong orders. Terrible place.

I will usually order any of these items and be content with my selection: caesar's chicken wrap, royal red robin burger (medium-well), clam chowder, fries/garlic fries (bottomless as well), mighty caesar salad with chicken.

Mary F.,"Suisun City, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/10/2014,"I see now that I'm not crazy! So many others are having the same experience!  My sons and I have been coming to this RR for several years, at least a couple times a month or more. During the past few months the quality of the food and the service there has gone downhill FAST. It used to be great??? I'm confused. I will mention only our last two visits, as there is too much else to mention here.. I kept giving it another try hoping the old familiar place would be back, but last night was the LAST straw.  Yesterday - My son ordered a plain hamburger. It arrived with a BITE taken out of the meat. Yes, a bite. Maybe it was just a fluke and the patty happened to be shaped that way? But this SCREAMS re-plating.  Also, I am vegetarian and ordered a wedge salad with NO BACON. The first one came with EXTRA BACON. Sent it back. The 2nd one came with a little bit of bacon tucked under some of the dressing like they either scraped off the other one, or somebody thought it was funny to throw a little bacon in there so I wouldn't notice because I sent it back. Insulting. As a side note, roughly half of the time that I order a garden patty on my burger, they send real meat and I have to send it back. Anyway, on this occasion the manager came over and apologized and took care of our check. Its sad that he had to do that. He will never have to do that again if he properly trains his staff.  A few weeks ago we were there - Our waitress was DRUNK. It was me and my kids again. I ordered ONE beer, and I was the only one at the table old enough to drink. A while later a different server arrives with TWO beers. Huh??? I send one back. It makes me wonder if the waitress wasn't hoping to keep one for herself. She had slurred speech and was quite obviously intoxicated. A short time later I was actually ready for a 2nd one, and it never arrived.  Many of the wonderful servers that used to work there I noticed are no longer present. Many of them knew my family by name because we go there so much. Now it seems the turnover is high and staff is not properly trained.  I'm very sad that I have to give up on this RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=320

I think I deserve a good burger that'll give me a blast from the past!  I've been eating pretty good lately and got rid of hella weight I might as well.  I got myself a freckled lemonade and I'll have to admit if any bar made that... I sure would stop being an alcoholic.  I got my usual with a side of sweat potato fries and got this plate that looks all fancy.  The fries wasn't as much as I remembered it 'cause they got it all hoarded together in his metal contraption thing (it has no bottom... better not be a pun to their ""bottomless fries"").  I had my burger cut in half so I could save it for later and asked for more fries.  The waitress comes back with a red basket of fries and about ten minutes later I ask for a box.  She gives me a small box and I thought... Hey, make it simple and just take the paper the fries were on and just put it in the box! So I did.  Dude, the bottom of the basket was HELLA GNARLY. Not just hella gnarly but HELLA GNARLY (high emphasis on capital letters).  There was old ketchup on the bottom of the basket that was incrusted in between the spaces of the basket, crumbs from what looks like the past meal that was placed in there!!

So we have literally watch this place take its turn for the worst.  The food is so-so but I gave this place one star because of the service. The service is terrible. If i have to go to the bathroom to get napkins to wipe our face and hands, you fail at your job. We received no napkins or silverware.  We saw our server a total of 2 times, when she ordered our food and when she brought it out. Our drinks had to be refilled by the manager but only because we waived him down. We complained, but it didn't seem to do any good. One server was clearing plates from his customers table and dropped forks and spilled sauce all over the floor. It even got in another customer. I saw him look at what he dropped, but did he return to clean it up? No. He didn't even let a busser know. I expect that when i speak to a manager about his server that he would let her know to be more attentive to her table. Its not like we wanted her to sit at our table and wait until we needed something, but we didn't even get the bare minimum of what i think a server should be doing. Clearly, they need to do more server training.  The reason we came back was because our server from the last 2 times was outstanding (her name is Jessica ). Honestly all of their servers should take tips from her, or she needs to be the manager of this location.

Lazandro S.,"Vallejo, CA",5,8,,1.0,12/30/2015,"Where to start...was really excited to eat here again and was really looking forward to my Bonzai burger that I normally get. I brought my brother and mother along. Once we were seated and placed our order, it took much longer than it normally did; and I've been here (and other Red Robin locations) when it was more full. I ordered my burger medium done. The food finally came, and I ate my fries first, which did not take too long because there were only around 10 pieces. I took my craving bite into my bonzai burger, only to see that it was prepared well done. I am not the type that likes to waste food, so I did not complain and just ate it, disappointed. We were given napkins and knives, but no forks, which I have always been given in the past considering these are gourmet burgers. My mother called our server over and asked for a fork, and my brother and I asked for more fries. She said okay, and that the fries would take 3 to 5 minutes. My brother and I finished our burgers, and my mother finished her sandwich, and a fork was never given. At this point, no fries were given either, and I saw other parties getting fries. At this point, more time has passed by than us waiting for our burgers in the beginning, and still no fries. Our server finally came back with just one basket of fries, and never gave us a fork, which would have been pointless at this point since we all finished our burgers/sandwiches. Having been to this location many times, all of this was a huge disappointment, and this was the only time I ever felt that a server did not receive a tip of any amount. Instead of receiving bottomless fries, we received bottomless disappointment. It will be a while before I dine at this location again. I would advise this particular server to communicate realistic times to customers instead of giving random, short times. Also, carry around a notepad so that she can remember what the customer(s) asked for. This location has really gone downhill compared to my previous times eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=280
Keila Renée R.,"Concord, CA",41,32,11,2.0,10/25/2014,"Okay so before I write this review I would like to state that I work in a restaurant, therefore I can appreciate the hard work it takes for everybody part of making it function. We walked in & it took about 5 minutes to be acknowledged. There was a woman standing at the station right beside us gathering checks for a party of 4 who apparently all wanted separate checks. It's a little more of a hassle when people ask for that-I know. However I didn't even get a ""be right with you"" or anything. She proceeded to drop off the checks & check on a few other tables, count some cash from her apron, & walk out of sight. Finally a lady came to seat us and I was already a little frustrated because I was hungry.  We were seated, a woman asked for our drink orders and she must've been new cause she was confused when I asked for the Thorny Señorita Rita and I had to point it out on the menu. She didn't ask whether I wanted it on the rocks or blended and I forgot to specify, and she didn't card me. I just turned 21 earlier this month so getting carded is somewhat fun for me because I finally have the proof! But anyways, our waiter was a different young man and was very nice. He took our orders and I asked him to make sure my drink was on the rocks. Our food came out, it was not good. I ordered the fish & chips and a cup of clam chowder to share with my sister, my mom ordered a cup of tortilla soup. The chips tasted stale, the soup was room temperature, & the bread that came with it was stale as well. The fish tasted fresh and pleasant but it was the only thing I really enjoyed. I asked for my soup to be re-warmed and they did it. In my restaurant, when something is cold, we have it re-made completely but I doubt the soup here is made to order. By this time my margarita still hadn't come out. Our server kept checking on it and it wasn't ready. I didn't want to make things difficult for him because I hate when customers blame me for things that go wrong in the kitchen and I ate it anyways because I was too hungry to wait for it to be re-made. A review for a restaurant as big as Red Robin probably won't make any difference, people will still come. However I hope they work these things out to become better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=280

Christopher C.,"Solano, CA",285,111,23,2.0,10/9/2014,"This Red Robin has gone down hill tremendously and quick!  While the food is just what you expect from a mall restaurant the service has pretty much hit rock bottom (again). My family has been coming year for quite some time and there has always been service issues. Whether it be slow, wrong, or just lazy it never quite gets high marks. Even at one visit a couple of years ago my wife made a comment to our server about the lack of organization and gaps in service to which the server went on to explain that the whole management staff was just fired and everyone working that day was replacements. This actually gave a ray of hope for the restaurant. We understood the chaos that could be brought on by a sudden change in leadership and embraced the fact that finally service might actually get better. I did...for a little while. Soon enough it was back to the inconsistency we have found to be the norm at this location. Fast forward to last night. We (7 of us) arrived at about 7:00p on a Wednesday evening...not very crowded. Actually about at 50% capacity if not less. However, with the amount of time we saw our server you would think that she was covering the entire restaurant herself. She took our drink order, then our food order, delivered food and that was about it. No refills, not coming by to check on us (even though other servers did and so did the manager). We asked for more condiments which were brought by another employee about 10 minutes later. My wife asked for a spoon for our son right when the food was brought out, she never came back. My wife went and got one herself. THEN 10 minutes after that, after our son had finished his meal she brought the spoon acting like we had just asked for it. Still no one had offered refills or anything. The server came back and pretty much offered us anything we wanted since she was doing such a bad job. Any food we wanted a ""refill"" on we could have....Kind of weird but whatever. After we had finished eating we waited....and waited...and WAITED for about 30 minutes for our check. Not only did we have to wait, we had to get another server to get the manager to get our check. Our server pretty much stopped caring and never came back.  Luckily the manager comped some of the meals but really thats not the point. It was just embarrassing how bad the service was and how little they seemed to care about it. Just as we were leaving the server came back and acted like she was trying to save face or something but gave a very lackluster ""apology"" and went on her way again.  Im sure we will go back at some point but we will never go to Red Robin when it is actually busy or when we are in a hurry.

Alexander E.,"San Pablo, CA",355,636,830,4.0,11/12/2011,"I've been wanting to try Red Robin ever since seeing those Red Robinnnnn commercials.  Lucky for me, the Westfield at Fairfield has a Red Robin.  The entrance for Red Robin is on the first floor of the mall and lacks a podium for a hostess, which is an issue: being that it was a Friday night, there were plenty of people trying to get in. Subsequently, there's no organization and I was quickly annoyed. Nevertheless once on the list, the wait was short and we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The restaurant resembles Applebees, both in price and atmosphere. The food offering is ""Gourmet Burgers"" and other American dishes.  I'd definitely say the biggest draw is their burgers, but their sandwich offerings sounded too good to pass up.  I settled on the Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich, which consisted of grilled chicken, bruschetta (on a sandwich!), pesto aioloi, provolone cheese, lettuce, and balsamic cream all on a rustic ciabatta roll.  Sandwiches come with bottomless steak-cut fires, which I opted to substitute with some steamed veggies. The sandwich was on par with some of the better delis I've tried.  The ciabatta bread was fresh and fluffy.  The bruschetta and pesto was an amazing combination, along with the perfectly grilled and seasoned chicken.  The provolone cheese gave it that last bit of perfection. I skipped on the fries, but I'm sure they would of been a perfect combination. All in all, I was really impressed with the quality of food and its price and value were just as great.  Our server was friendly and did a decent job of serving us.  She did disappear toward the end of our service, but its not a huge deal.  I'll definitely be back to try some of their other signature sandwiches and steak-cut fries.

We were seated right away but it seemed forever for the waitress to come and take our order. The hostess took our drink orders and didn't seem like she knew what was going on. After about 10 minutes the waitress finally came to take our order. At this point it seemed like things were going to go great. High hopes, and high dreams.  The food took forever, at one point we saw the food on the counter and watched it sit there for another 10 minutes. So by the time everything came it was pretty cold. I order the sweet potato fries, they cam out not so sweet but burnt. You would think a burger place could get fries right. I guess that would be asking to much. The steak fries were also cold.  Things were so slow that it reminded me of why I don't come to this place. The waitress seemed to be having a conversation with her friends at another table.

They're always crispy and very tender.  The bottomless fries along with their house spice is the bomb dot com.  If I want a burger I will get a Royal burger which is bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and a fried egg on top of a medium rare meat patty.  Mmmm just writing about makes my mouth water.  I have only encountered one problem at this location but the manager was sure to make things right by giving me a $25 gift card and asking us to check in with her each time we came in.  I thought that was class service.  I feel like this location has better food and service compared to the Pleasant Hill location. Oh and I wanted to mention I'm not a milkshake person but when Red Robin offered the gingerbread milkshake I had to try it and it totally changed my mind about milkshakes.  I'm picky about them and theirs was delicious!

Jada B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",16,105,86,3.0,11/12/2011,"Like I previously stated in my Concord and Vacaville reviews, I would give this 4 stars for my love of Red Robin as a whole. The 3 stars is just for this location. Something about this location just feels cramped. And its kind of awkward that people doing their mall shopping can just stop and watch you eat your food. The last particular time I came to Red Robin, we cam for happy hour.  We ordered: 2 margarita's 1 order of happy hour nachos I swear we order things other than margarita's and nachos, we just seem to be on this trend lately. Anywhoo. Service was kind of slow with the drinks, but there was only one bartender on staff and the bar was busier than the rest of the restaurant. When we did get the margaritas they were the tasty standard you expect. Then it went all wrong. The nachos came out and all looked well until we started digging in and realized 95% of the nacho topping was black beans. Basically just tortilla chips that had a can of undrained black beans dumped. Why we didn't send them back, I don't know. We kept telling ourselves ""oh the rest of the toppings are underneath this next layer"". Stupid I know. At least we had a little bit of guacamole and sour cream. We finally found the ""cheeseburger queso"" at the bottom of the plate. I felt so let down, RR had never failed me before! I don't know if this is just the happy hour version, but these were awful. I would give them .5 a star for the tasty guacamole.

Krish A.,"Sacramento, CA",63,53,4,1.0,8/15/2011,"Red Robin used to be the place to go at the Solano Mall, but man have things changed. My friends and I decided to come here late Saturday night and the place was so dead. When we entered, half the restaurant was not filled and the person seating people was already ready to leave. We were seated in the back, more towards, the entrance to the mall. There was one server for that whole section and it took him more than 10 minutes to even ask for our drink orders.  He seemed frantic but was still trying to be friendly. When we placed our orders our food took longer than expected to arrive. The person handing out our food didn't even know the difference between each burger. He continually kept giving the wrong burger to each of us.  I specifically ordered a bacon cheeseburger with no mayo and bleu cheese. When I received my order I got a bleu cheeseburger with mayo and no bacon. When I pointed it out to our server he offered to give me a side of bacon or have my burger re-cooked. Normally I would have let them re-do my food but I knew I'd probably get my food spat on or other horrible things. They were kind enough to take a dollar of my bill, but it doesn't take away from the bad service we received. This place used to be packed and the food used to be better. Maybe it was an off night, maybe their whole restaurant just sucks, I don't know.

It's close by and we needed to eat. However, we were both extremely disappointed with the service and quality of food.  The service was alright (not trying to be a difficult customer), but really please give us more than 2 minutes to look at the menu and decide what we want. She came over twice asking if we were ready when we clearly weren't. Again, I'm not trying to be difficult, but seriously, stop hovering over my table and ruining my dining experience. Anyway, after a careful examination of this chain restaurant menu, we both decided to get the clucks and shrimps entree platter... the description made it sound pretty decent. However, when we got our orders, they only gave us chicken strips.. Where were the shrimp? We had to clarify with the server that we ordered cluck AND shrimp, not just cluck. So, he brought out a plate with 6 pieces of shrimp. My first impression was, ""Wait, that's it? Is that for two people or just one person?"" Apparently, the 6 pieces of shrimp was for 2 people.. so 3 pieces of shrimp each. I was very disappointed... and even more disappointed when I took a bite of the overly breaded shrimp with no seasoning or flavor whatsoever.  Overall, it was a very unenjoyable dining experience... so maybe next time (if there's a next time), I should follow what the restaurant sign suggests.. and get ""gourmet burger and spirits"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=340

Clarke J.,"Vallejo, CA",47,114,1,4.0,3/30/2011,"For me to give a ""chain"" restaurant a four star rating is odd, as I usually avoid the cookie-cutter eateries. But, I have to be fair, and honest. It's funny to me, almost unusual, that Red Robin has the best fish and chips in town, better than any of the independent specific places that are geared only towards this meal. Here's the deal: Red Robin calls it ""Arctic Cod Fish and Chips"". Whatever. The filets are always just right crispy, there's and endless supply of large cut fries, and they always, without complaint, bring me extra lemon wedges for my fish. Now for the kicker. Their tartar sauce, which has lots of dill and a secret ingredient, is the bomb. Not in the least mayonnaise tasting, it makes a wonderful dip for the fries! Go figure. Not greasy or oily in the slightest. Just wonderful. It's a recipe that they've got right. Who'da thunk it? Best fish and chips in town at a chain burger joint. Huh! Wash it all down with a real milkshake with extra in the tin cup, and you're good to go. A complete meal, if a lit bit guilty. Then, head right upstairs to the movie theater for the latest flick. Perfect. The only downside is that you need a booth. Their little tables for two are just that. Little. Hardly room to set down your cellphone, sunglasses and newspaper. Midget size. Get a booth and be comfortable. Wee but noisy, too. But, it's a family place in the mall, so  you expect some noise. The food comes pretty quick, and is consistent.

Zac O.,"Fairfield, CA",30,141,34,2.0,10/24/2009,"Well, I am not a huge chain restaurant fan, but due to me being at the mall and not wanting Chik-fila again, I chose to grab a bite here. After all, how bad could it be? It was getting near closing for the mall so we got our car from the other end and parked at the outside entrance. Getting closer to the door, we see the pack of nicotine freaks,employees and customers alike, huddled under the stairs about ten feet from door. We are bombarded with the scent of smoke and another smell most resembling sewage. You would think that would have turned us back immediately, but we must have been ready for adventure, cause we just commented on the stink and continued inside. We were greeted by a very friendly server and seated right away.We got what I felt was the best seat in the place, it was on the far edge where we could see the mall while we ate. That's where the good times ended.       Our server came by table to let us know that he would be back in a second. We didn't see him again for 5 mins or so. Then when he returns and asks us what we wanted to start the meal with, he seems bummed out that we only wanted to order our meals and not get any appetizers. After about 10 minutes, we hear him tell the tables behind us that he is sorry about the wait, something has happened in kitchen and has slowed down the food. Where is our apology, or our drinks? He must have read our minds because he quickly shows up with our drinks and does a little song and dance about the wait. Finally, our food arrives. As my rating states, Meh I've seen better. maybe the servings were small due to the promise of bottomless fries, but when I spend $12 on a chick sand, I expect  the sandwich to be the HNIC of my plate.       Don't get me wrong, the chicken had good flavor, but it was smaller than my hand and was gone in what seemed like much too short a time for a twelve dollar burger. I am not a huge french-fry fan and for what we paid, we could have been ass deep in Chik-Fila or even a Carl's Jr Chicken sandwich would have killed what we were served. Our waiter didn't come back around until it was obvious that we were finished and our glasses were empty for most of our dinner. He had a little smirk and tried to be upbeat, but I think he knew what he was serving was like slapping each customer in the mouth. 2 stars because the sandwich had good flavor, 0 stars for the rest of the bullshit.

First of all when you walk up to get a table they say that the wait is about 20-25 minutes which is fine, but when you see maybe a quarter of the tables empty and they aren't calling anyone something has to be up.  But they don't tell you what is going on and I watched the person calling names just keep looking at the clock before calling people.  I'm pretty sure they were literally waiting for each person to have been waiting for 20-25 minutes before seating.  (Later on in the evening I heard the manager telling another employee that they were making people wait longer rather than seating.)  At that point I wasn't entirely sure what was going on but that should have been a good indicator that I should run the other way. When we finally got seated it took a couple of minutes for the waiter to take our order, but it took at least 15 minute just to get our drinks.  Then another 10-15 minutes just to get our onion rings.  So at about 30 minutes that was more or less the last time we saw our waiter for the next 30 minutes.  An hour after being seated our waiter comes by and tells us that the manager will be around shortly to explain what was going on.  He never showed up at our table, but I saw him stop by a lot of other tables....We were getting pretty annoyed at this point.  Our waiter came by again and said that our food was coming right out in a few minutes...(didn't happen).  Then he started bringing out fries to tables, but this was over an hour after being seated and I just wanted my food so I could get out of there.  I believe after about an hour and a half we finally got our burgers.  They messed up our bill so it took even longer to pay but when we finally got out of there, it was basically 2 hours wasted. I believe in the past we waited upwards of 20 minutes just to pay the bill, so I'm not convinced this is an isolated incident.  I won't be returning again...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=400

Our server sees we are done with our fries and says I will get you your bill. I look over at my girlfriend and ask did she just say ""i'lll go get you your bill?"" My girlfriend says i think so. We wait till the server comes back and she does bring us our check. We tell her we never got our food. She replies in a shocked voice ""Are you serious."" In our heads we are thinking how can you forget, you never brought us our food. Without even giving any apology she just says i will be right back. My girlfriend was very upset and she got up and asked the first server if we can speak to a manager. The manager comes over within a few minutes, and my girlfriend explains the situation, and again the manager didnt really say i am sorry. We say can we please just pay for our drinks and go. The manager says no let me go check on your food. The manager does eventually come with food and it is completely the wrong order. After we tell her it's the wrong order she goes back again to check on our order. The third time she comes back to our table she says i am sorry for what happened and says our drinks and food is free and she offers us a gift card. We take take the gift card and decide to just leave. I've had bad service in the past but never this bad.

Today, we decide to go to a movie at the mall.  We noticed that Red Robin had a lot of empty seats so we should have ample time to eat lunch and go to the movie.  When we walked up, we noticed that there were 2 hostesses, one being the same one we had had previously.  After waiting approximately 10 minutes while others were being seated or others went to the bar to eat, our names were called.  Once again, it was the same hostess and she started taking us to the bar.  Since we didn't want to eat at the bar and could have gone there earlier, she took the menus, went back to the front, and proceeded to ignore us while others were called to be seated.  (I know that there was at least 6 empty tables because I could easily see them from the front.) Needless to say, we were not happy campers.  After being ignored and being in a hurry to get to the movies, we left and went somewhere else.  Upon arriving home, I immediately shot off an email to Red Robin corporate letting them know about the treatment that we had received both times at that restaurant by the same ""hostess.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=400

Lester A.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",114,345,4,4.0,12/18/2007,"I've eaten here a number of times and can say I've never had a bad experience.  Service has always been OK to really good and always liked their food.  I was actually happy that they opened one in Fairfield.  They have great burgers, love the bottomless fries and freckled lemonade.  I've never had to wait long at a red robins and it's even a cool place to get a few drinks at the bar.  Sometimes there's a lot of traffic in and out of red robin cuz a lot of people cut through the place to enter or leave the mall.  But if you're in the mall and want a good burger, go to Red Robbin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=440
kellea p.,"San Diego, CA",3,33,,2.0,4/9/2009,"Red Robin is a chain and being so they should all be pretty standard in their food quality.  Unfortunately this Red Rob gets a pitiful 2 stars.  The first week my husband and I moved to this area we decided to check out the mall and get a bite to eat.  We decided to go to Red Robin because the one in San Diego (where we lived) wasn't that great (although the one in VA is AWESOME).  Well, unfortunately, this one is on the same level as the one in San Diego.  First, I asked for cheddar cheese on my burger, instead of Swiss (hate Swiss), and lo and behold it had Swiss on it, when it came out.  Second, everything was greasy! It was gross!  As I held my burger I had grease going down my hand.  Obviously, I didn't finish it.  Finally, our check was messed up when we got it. We got charged for things that we didn't even order.  Seriously?!  Lame.  Yes, this review is partly to blame on the lame waiter we had but also on the overly greasy food we got.  So, if you're looking for a casual burger place to eat... keep going and find somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=440
Ashley M.,"Fairfield, CA",6,13,,1.0,5/23/2009,So one night my boyfriend and i took his lil sister to dinner with us. The service honesty SUCKS!!! Even though they were about to close we got the worst service. We didn't even get utensils. I had to walk up and get it myself. the tables weren't clean. It took awhile to get our re-frills! You'd think that if you go right before they close you would get great service. Guess wrong!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=440
