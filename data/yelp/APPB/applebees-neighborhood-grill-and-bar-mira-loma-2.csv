Ana C.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/21/2017,I'll just copy and paste what I sent to corporate  Hi I visited one of your restaurants in eastvale I ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizers and when I bit into it it had a faul taste Immidiatly rushed to the restroom and threw up my food I asked to speak to a manager and she told me it was bacon that it comes with bacon and told me and there was nothing else she could tell me i told her none of the other pieces have that smell or that brown stuff in them Then asked her if she could smell it bc it didn't smell like baconshe refused and went to the back she came back and said it was seasoning I told her it's really hard to believe it smell like a bunch of chemicals and grese it made me throw up  and she was being extremely rude and told me i didn't have to believe her. I'm contacting you because I don't wanna have to go threw a lawyer i will contact news channel as I kept the quesadilla and will have it tested if you can't provide me with a solution to this situation. What was in my quesadilla was not edible!! The managers name was huyapa,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=20

Sandy P.,"Norco, CA",19,6,,2.0,5/8/2017,"Pretty disappointed in this establishment. We've stopped coming for a while due to the uncleanliness of the restaurant, but decided to give it another try. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and opened our silverware... my fork still had rice remain between the prongs and my guest had lettuce wrapped theirs - gross. We asked for plastic cutlery (like the ones they give the take out orders) and even that had been previously opened. One bonus star to Larry who accommodated us and brought us another -unopened-set. When the beers finally arrived I noticed there was still lipstick marks on the rim and enough fingerprints to supply a lifetime of Clue games. Bartender was cool and swapped is for ""fresh"" new glasses... at this point we were ready to say screw it and leave, but Larry assured us and the food was already on it's way out. Luckily we just had a couple appetizers.  Long story short- this place isn't what it used to be and hasn't changed much for the better in the past 10 months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=20

Hannah L.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/5/2017,"Omg the service here is ridiculously slow. Came in on a Thursday before 5 pm and it wasn't even packed. It took about ten mins until someone finally came to the table, we immediately ordered because who knew how long it would have taken until someone finally would come back. It took over an hour just to get our food, you would have thought they went to kill the cow with the time they were taking. Hands down this was the worst Applebee's experience I have ever had and will never come to the eastvale location. Oh and to top it off the food wasn't even properly cooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=20

Estefania S.,"Covina, CA",73,23,14,1.0,2/18/2017,"One of the worst sirloin steaks I have ever had. For the past few visits this place has been getting my order wrong when I order a sirloin steak. I ask for a medium well I get overly cooked. I ask for a medium rare I'm practically eating the cow as soon as they butcher it. Who is managing this kitchen that the chefs don't realize they have clearly over cooked my steak. They do they just don't care and don't want to waste money on starting on a new piece. As a customer I feel cheated because they are pretty much saying ""hey you ordered a medium well steak but we messed up so here you go.

Scott C.,"Corona, CA",0,42,,1.0,7/17/2017,Haven't been to Applebee's in years!  Can't figure out why I don't eat here more often.  The food and the service was great and I really truly always enjoy it.   Again can't figure out why I don't come more often because I do eat out a lot  Update...!  What a nightmare this place was this time. No staff to get anything done. I feel like we are hassling the server if we ask for plates or silverware. He's acting out out because they can't get their act together. Been here a hour and still no food. And yes it's been a full hour.  Saw two people walk in and they left because they weren't ever even greeted or led to a table. What a stark difference from before. Not sure what happened but there's barely and customers here and yet they still can't have even a 1 out of 10 when it comes to service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=20

Brett M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,99,36,4.0,8/13/2016,Stopped by this afternoon with a bunch of families and boys with a soccer team.  We showed up before they opened and once they opened they took care of us so very well.  Very courteous and patient and made sure we were well taken care of.   The waitress was absolutely wonderful and had a smile the whole time.  Took care of all of the checks separately and did it with a smile.   My only complaint was I ordered a sirloin salad and the meat was very tough.  And there was not a lot of it.  Salad was decent.  Lots of dressing.   But very impressed with the service.   Most places get grouchy when a team walks in.  This place was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=20

Jose U.,"Rialto, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/1/2017,"Hey All,  Although I have never really been much of a Yelp reviewer, I felt that this particular experience at this Applebee's warranted coming onto this site and making an account.  On January 29th, 2017, I decided to meet up with some old friends for food and drinks at this location. Although, admittedly, Applebee's food and drinks don't necessarily blow me away, we figured why not, considering it was on the way to our destination. The reason for this review is for one thing only: TO PRAISE OUR SERVER MARK! In the 23 years that I have been on this Earth, I have never had a server as attentive, funny and just downright good at his job at this guy. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by the host and Mark immediately stepped in, asking us how our day had been so far and showing up to a table large enough to fit our group. Upon being seated, he was quick to offer up some drink recommendations and even quicker to input what we had selected into the computers. I ordered the BBQ wings and our group ordered a combination of platters, other flavors of wings and several types of drinks. I don't even think that 10 minutes passed before our food started arriving at our table. Out of all of our orders (there were 7 of us), Mark didn't even miss one thing... not even getting one of the orders of wing dry with the sauce on the side (you'd be surprised how many restaurants mess this little thing up). The entire time that we were waiting, Mark checked in on us a couple of times and always made sure to refill our waters. This was probably one of the few times that I haven't felt like I was dying of thirst before my server refilled me! As we ate, drank and caught up with each other, I could see that Mark wasn't just attentive to our table, but to everybody else's as well. Even when a customer complained that that she had received the wrong drink, he had no problem going right back up to the bartender and bringing back a correctly made (and probably stiff!) drink. A couple with a child came into the restaurant a short while after my group and Mark kindly asked us if we could scoot our two tables over to make room for this couple and their baby, which we did. In the end, my party was there for a few hours and the entire time, Mark never let our continuous calling of him to our table frustrate him or obstruct any aspect of his workflow. If all servers were as professional as he was, Applebee's would rake in the big bucks.  At the end of the day, I hope somebody from management sees this and rewards Mark or something! They'd be wrong to not do something for I will forever consider one of their best employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=20

Britney M.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",217,625,1057,4.0,9/26/2015,"So I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's but the service was good and the food was decent. We stuck just to happy hour specials so the check was super cheap considering all the food we ordered! I believe we ordered like 5 different appetizers; mozzarella sticks, chicken tacos, buffalo wings, artichoke dip, and a kids meal pizza with fries. The bill was so freaking cheap since happy hour prices are half off! Wooohoooo. Pretty awesome. Our waitress was very attentive and food came out pretty quick and was nice and hot. Overall good experience! Oh yeah we did desert the butter cake with nuts and frosting.

Stephanie V.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,12,,4.0,3/13/2017,"The 4 stars is for the food in general, I've been here a few times and it was either a hit or miss. Best thing I've tried here was the chicken with tortilla strips. The service, however, 5 stars! Our waitress was Ginger and I loved how positive she was. I'm picky when it comes to service and of course I'm not expecting the best for a place like Applebees, but Ginger really made the top of the list as for service wise. She had such a bubbly personality and gave great suggestions and told us what she liked off the menu and she didn't seem to be in a hurry to leave us (even though she had other tables) which makes the customers feel important. Definitely will be asking for Ginger whenever we decide to eat here and really recommend her to be your waitress!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=20

Service was horrible ! I don't know if our waiter was overwhelmed or not but he did not pay attention to us our food took 25 min to arrive he didn't check on us at allll we wanted another drink it took home about 20 min to come and ask us if we needed anything drinks took along time to Come we literally waited about 15 min maybe even 20 seemed like forever when we would ordered more drinks he said the bar was backed up well I suggest knowing there is nothing to do in Eastvale you know Friday and Saturday is going to be busy be more staffed .

Glen C.,"Carson, CA",1431,290,544,5.0,12/11/2013,"This particular Applebee's popped my Applebee cherry after a long day of promoting with my girlfriend and some street teamers years ago.  The ambiance is like a dark version of Tchotchke's.... the restaurant that Jennifer Aniston's character from the movie ""Office Space"" worked at.  I was like ""DAMMIT!"" when I couldn't find anybody acting like a Brian, to tell me about the steak fajitas and that I had a case of ""The Mondays"".   Applebee's looks like a place where random horders left a bunch of their stuff around the damn walls and walked away for months so they can buy even more stuff to put around their walls.  The food is AWESOME.  Damn near everything at Applebee's is delicious.  Parking is cool abundant since it's within a huge stripmall off a freakin' freeway.  I wish there were more Applebee's around the Carson/Torrance area though.   5 stars for this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=100

Tiffany N.,"Westminster, CA",27,52,38,1.0,3/16/2015,"My girlfriend and I entered the building and we were greeted with a smiling face - what a good  hostess, probably the best employee there. We were promptly seated and the hostess was excited to tell us of their custom tablets that could be used to order appetizers and desserts, or even pay the bill. Our server came over and this is when it all went downhill. She was friendly and smiling the entire time through. She offered us FRESH strawberry lemonade, my girlfriend's favorite, with strawberries in it. She took my order as well, a root beer. She came back with our drinks and informed us the restaurant was out of strawberries (really? At 3pm? The restaurant was practically empty), but instead of asking us if we wanted something else to substitute the drink, because the fresh strawberries was what my girlfriend had been hoping for, our sever just brought out pink lemonade from the tap and still charged us the full price. She also brought raspberry ice tea. Not even close to soda, and put it on the bill as ""pepsi"". Then we went to ordering ""2 appetizers for 9.50"" the menu said. Our server failed to tell us that the tablet didn't have the option of doing the combo deal so we ordered two regular sized appetizers thinking we would still get the 9.50 deal. Then I ordered the pepper crusted steak with whole grains, medium rare. My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders platter for her sister that was with us (literally the ONLY thing they got right). Our server left, another table was seated in front of us, business went on. The appetizers were alright. Spinach artichoke dip had very thin chips, every single chip broke as you tried to dip them, not to mention they were unevenly salted (one would be bland the other would be just a thing full of salt). The siracha shrimp was alright. Nothing special. It was fried shrimp with a very salty, not so siracha flavored coating.  Then the table in front of us got their food. Excuse me? We had gotten there first, and we both ordered steaks, different kinds, but how does your kitchen work when a customer who orders practically half an hour after you get their food first? Anyway. Our food eventually came out. My steak? Well done. I asked for medium rare. I had the food sent back. The chicken tenders were made perfect fine. My steak came back out. Medium well, close to well done again. I said ""forget it. Sure my steak is fine"". I took a bite: chewy and not seasoned at all. I took a bite of the rice and spinach and tomatoes that came with the dish and it was disgusting. I can't really describe the taste for you other than it was very chewy, the spinach tasted over cooked, and the tomatoes were filled with the seasoning but in juice form.  Absolutely tired and disappointed with the food, I asked for a box when the waitress came by. I paid while I waited. The box never came. The server was off helping 2 other tables. Let's talk about the service. Like I mentioned the hostess was great- friendly, energetic, a smile the entire time. Our waitress was nice as well, but not very helpful. She decided to check on us either too frequently at the wrong time, or not enough at the right time. She asked us how our food was, but our appetizers hadn't  been on the table for more than 2 minutes. Then she wasn't very courteous about placement of food either, she shoved and placed the plates wherever she felt she could put them. Then she asked us again in a very quiet, mumbled voice,  5 minutes later with our mouths full. I had to ask her to repeat herself. Then when our actual food came out, she was no where to be found. She did ask how it was and proceeded to walk away when we hesitated to answer about the incorrect cooking of the steak. She politely took the plate back and got a new entree done. Two minutes after receiving it, and putting a small piece in my mouth, she came up from behind and asked ""how's your steak?"" - somewhat creepily. I was startled and had a mouth full, and just answered ""oh it's fine"" before really getting to taste it, but she scurried away. The steak actually was under seasoned and medium well, close to well done again. Then we never saw her until she passed by us to help another customer. When I confronted her about the appetizer deal, she tried to explain it as ""oh the deal has smaller portions..."" and I said, ""The tablet doesn't have the option... It just says what you can order"". She looked flustered (even though she knew we were going to order appetizers since we sat down and TOLD her we were going to order them from the tablet) and proceeded to try and scurry away to try and attempt to get someone to help her. I just was over it at this point and said ""it's fine, though"". Though next time, they should tell their customers that since the tablets are KNEW, they should feel free to ask the server for help or just have the server take the order. Not a happy customer. We will NOT be returning to ANY Applebee's restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=100
Jason P.,"Corona, CA",112,36,15,1.0,4/4/2014,"So....I am not the type of person to write a negative review, but our experience at Applebee's in Eastvale (on Limonite w/15 Fwy) was absolutely horrible! My wife and I went there with our 2 boys, plus our friends and their son.  It was semi busy, wait time for a table was about 10 min and the server was friendly. But honestly, I think he and all the employees were overwhelmed.  We ordered our food and first, they brought out a wrong order. Our appetizer never came out. 6 out of the 7 meals came out and the last one finally came out 10 min later.  My 2 year old sons Mac n cheese had a long, black, curly hair in it....it was mixed into the food!   The manager on-duty came by, apologized and knocked off $10, but we weren't looking for a hook up, we were looking for them to say something like ""we are sorry that is a hair from the line"", but instead, he said ""wow, we don't do that""!  Really?!?!

We finally order and the food is fine. We get ready to go and my friend asked for a box. (I knew that was going to be another 15 minutes.)

Food: 1 to 2 star average (It's gross) Service: Somewhat slow and rude at times Decor: Contemporary with bar on the other side, night club conducive View: Parking lot and streets Outdoor seating?: Don't know Parking?: Plentiful Noise Level: Noisy What is up with the gross ass food?  It doesn't matter which Applebee's you go to, they pride themselves with preservative laden, too salty, gross stank food.  If you were to ask corporate about their food, they'd give you politician lie drivel.  Will never eat there again . I don't even go if people invite me.  Last time I was there I asked for lemonade and the waitress brings me something made from a packet mix. Really? People are supposed to be satisfied with that? How much freaking trouble and why is it too much to ask to squeeze a lemon and put sweet water in a glass? The mix tastes disgusting. Gee the bar has tons of lemons, so the lame excuse of a response, "" Oh we can't do that"" is not only lame, it is rude. Their menu is strange and for some reason seems very limited in choice. And they don't like substitution requests or modifications, not even simple ones. Some of the food at this place is ok, but not outstanding, and some of it is gross and has too much of a chemical taste. I believe restaurants like this are trying to weed dining customers out and focus on and expand the bar, because that's where the real profits are. You certainly don't go to places like this for the food, or do you? And if so, why? It's gross, one preservative or another and far too much salt The ambiance is urban sprawl casual with views of the parking lot, street and stores in certain corners of the restaurant. There is a huge bar on the other side. The design inside reminds me of The Outback, (same company?)  but I like the Outback. Applebees? No. ______________________ Most recent  visit was in November of  2014 for Veteran's Day.  After the chubby waitress spilled iced tea all over the table  and  my friend, she had the nerve to charge for the splash of cranberry drink I ordered on top of my iced tea (50 cents) Seriously Applebees? If it were up to me, she wouldn't have gotten any tip. As usual the food wasn't all that great The highlight of this visit was the distinctly nervous male host.

Matt A.,"Riverside, CA",95,33,11,4.0,12/7/2011,"Pros: Service, Atmosphere, Happy Hour Cons: Average Food Been to many Applebee's their locations can be hit or miss. I know the one in Corona is horrible, however this one closer to home is actually enjoyable. Their food compared to most major chains is below average. Its comparable to Dennys. But Applebee's like Dennys are always busy, so people must keep coming back. So to me the assumption is, you should know that going in and not be surprised right? Knowing the food is going to be average at best, I haven't tried something there I didn't enjoy. Their appetizers are equivalent to bar food, but my wife and I really enjoy the chips and salsa. You get a lot for like $2 and they're actually pretty good. What separates this place from most Applebee's is the service. From the people who greet you when you come in, to your servers in the bar area, we always show up and leave happy there. Also I love how the place is decorated in local memorabilia including historic photos of our towns history.

Tamara E.,"Riverside, CA",0,66,4,2.0,5/6/2014,"Went there today for lunch with my 1.5 year old and mom. I can't say the experience was bad, but it was definitely strange. The hostess sat us quickly and at first our waitress was friendly enough. I always order for my daughter upon seating and she put in the order and brought out her juice very quickly which I appreciated. So definitely a good start. The weirdness started after. My mom went to order the wonton taco's but then realized she could get them in a trio special and sample a couple other items. I heard her tell the server instead of the tacos I want the trio with wanton taco, pretzels, and a steak quesadilla. Easy enough right? Wrong. They bring out a plate of wonton tacos and the trio. That's a lot of freakin wonton tacos for one person. When the server came by she told her about the extra order and the server said I thought you ordered both. My mom is way nicer then me and told her she didn't but it was fine. The server replied okay good and walked away. Umm.....we were both dumbfounded. Then not even five minutes later she brings our check and places it standing up between my mom and I who were talking. We weren't half way done with our food. She claimed it was for convenience. Once again ummm... Then she went to check on the table next to us turned around and asked if the check was ready to go. No, I've taken like three bites. I laid down the book so I can talk since you obstructed my view of who I was speaking too. So odd, and so rushed. It's not like we take our sweet time, my daughter was well behaved and it wasn't busy. We seriously had just gotten our food an for as much as it is id like to have enjoyed it. We were also charged for the wontons that weren't ordered. I wanted to speak to the manager but like I said before my mom is super nice and doesn't like making a fuss.  Overall the food was tasty. No complaints there and the service started strong and midway through got bad and rushed. So so so strange.

So we got one next to the door. Boo! Lol. There were a couple other booths open but for some reason they wanted to give us the crappy tables. Oh well. We ordered drinks first which were Captain Bahama Mamas. They were really good. I didn't even taste alcohol in them, which must mean they're water down, because I hate the taste of alcohol, and most drinks are usually too strong for me. We also ordered one of the blue Hawaiian Long Island Iced Teas. I could taste a little alcohol in that one. It was a good drink though. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer. They give you a ton of chips and a tiny tiny bit of dip. The dip is very good though. Has a huge glob of mozzarella cheese on top, which I accidentally ate in one bite thinking it was a big piece of artichoke LOL. I ordered the barbecue brisket tacos. Those are pretty good. They had some crunchy fried onions on it, some salsa, and a little sauce. I added sour cream. You got three of them and they're good sized. They come with fries which were absolutely amazing. They are seasoned fries, and I loved them. And a tiny little thing of coleslaw, which was okay. Nothing special. Hubby got the six ounce steak with the fried mushrooms and onion, although they forgot the mushrooms and just put onion. And he added a butter sauce to it which was really yummy. It came with steamed broccoli and hashbrown casserole, which wasn't the best thing ever. Had an odd taste to it. It was nice inside. Super busy, but not super loud.

Adriana G.,"Eastvale, CA",64,123,222,4.0,6/22/2017,"Applebee's is a family staple, and having frequented quite a few across the state, this Eastvale location has proven to be one of the best.  Like many Applebee's, this restaurant is located in a shopping center - the Eastvale Gateway, to be exact.  Either before or after your meal, you can enjoy a Target run, grab some tech at Best Buy, shop the deals at Kohls or TJ Maxx, or catch the latest flick at the Regal theater just a few steps away.  Parking is generally adequate, however due to close proximity to a Carino's restaurant, it can get busy at peak ""eating out"" times (Friday/Saturday/Sunday evenings).  Given its newness, the facilities feel updated and there have even been some minor furniture renovations in recent years.  The decor features the local culture of Eastvale, which is fun given that the city was incorporated in 2010. The menu is clear and easy to read, boasting a good variety of foods.  Something Applebee's gets right is the inclusion of calories with every menu item.  The definitely helps me make better dinner choices and I appreciate the gesture and wish more restaurants would do the same.  They frequently refresh their menu with rotating items and there are always a few good options regardless of your calorie intake.  There is even a smaller-portioned dessert - the brownie bite (360 cal) - for those who have a sweet tooth but don't want to waste a whole meal's worth of calories on it. Options for kids are pretty standard and they do offer healthier sides, although my children always opt for the fries. The service is usually great, and sometimes there are standouts, like Ginger who was extremely kind to me and my children this evening.   Overall, you can't go wrong with this Applebee's, although we do like to avoid the busiest times so as not to have to wait for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2

Joe G.,"Eastvale, CA",410,550,5225,4.0,1/23/2017,"I remember when Applebee's was all the buzz. It was a place I would frequent with college classmates and eventually became a regular rotation for the family. The Eastvale location has been a regular part of my family since moving here 6 years ago; offers a simple and easy menu to please every eater. It has been a long time since eating at this location, probably since I have been into Yelp, so this place doesn't offer that excitement like most new spots. Kids wanted to eat here, so I decided to entertain their idea since they usually accompany me on most of my Yelp adventures.  Restaurant is family friendly and offers a separate bar area for those who want to escape the dining area. I like to dine in the bar area but now there is a waiting list when it is busy inside. Service is usually a bit slower because there are only a couple of servers covering about 15 tables. The bartender covers the bar area, people sitting at the bar, and the restaurant.  Kid's meals are simple and do not come overloaded with food. I think it is the perfect amount for a small child. I do enjoy the lighter calorie meals. You can even get a semi-decent steak here for under $15. I like the portion sizes for the regular meals as well. I like to get the salads and ask for the dressing on the side because the cooks usually drench it and you will have lettuce that floats.  Happy hour menu is just okay. I have seen it evolve over the years. The HH menu was great back in the day but now they have limited to just a few items. I tried the won ton tacos. The tacos were surprisingly good but would easily fit in the palm of your hand. Everyone is nice at this location. In fact, I do not think I have ever had a negative experience at any Applebee's besides the wait time on food. Whenever they are semi-busy it seems to take forever for your order to show. Drinks are good. Nice to see they still had my good old friend Brewtus. This location is cool. Easy place to grab a bite and see some familiar faces working. Inexpensive place to feed the family.

No, not here! No more business for this place!

Unfortunately the food still isn't that great, but I don't think that has anything to do with this establishment in particular and it's more of a franchise issue. The appetizers are pretty good, but the main courses leave a lot to be desired. However, the service here is great. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed the whole time. The manager even replaced my daughter's meal after she had gotten it because she ended up not liking it.

She was just amazing. She was able to handle all 5 of us, which isn't an easy task for usual waitresses. She was nice and a great listener! The food, was spectacular. The best chicken I've ever had, the best sauces, the best salad, even the best strawberry lemonade! My wife didn't really like the taste of her plate, she thought it needed more salt or something. I believe it was a chicken Alfredo. But everything else was just amazing and my whole family loved it! Will definitely return again! My ONLY complaint is they didn't really handle bringing out things too well... They brought all the drinks, but didn't bring my lemonade until minutes later. Then, everyone's salad came but mine, and no one brought it! Next thing I know everyone is done with their salads and they're bringing out the main entree's and I'm like, uh, I never got my salad!

I had the cajun shrimp pasta and it was surprisingly good.  The sauce had a good flavor and they give you a good amount of shrimp, which were also very good.  Overall, I really enjoyed it.   The service sometimes is not that great here, but if you sit in the bar area, hopefully you'll get ""Michael"".  He's really attentive, helpful, and doesn't treat you like a number.  We usually come here once or twice a month, and whenever we get lucky and he's our waiter, he always gives us great customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=140

Yet, the server, who was Latina, immediately served the group of Latinos who came in several minutes after us. We found this very conspicuous considering we are made up of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Indian people.  After finally getting menus, the server still didn't swing by to take our order! We waited another 5 minutes before the hostess happened to walk by and noticed we hadn't been helped. She apologized profusely and said she would get someone to help us. It took almost 15 minutes before someone took our order! Needless to say this was the start of a horrible dining experience. The food took forever to come out, we never received items like napkins we asked for, and the server never checked in on us after we received the food.

Amber Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,6,2.0,7/20/2012,"The customer service here was so bad.  Let me start off by saying that this was my first time ever coming to an applebee's and probably my last time.  When my boyfriend and I came in, the lady sat us in the bar area...I was kind of turned off by this atmosphere because I was just expecting to eat at a nice restaurant without any neon lights and tv's all over the place. It was just loud and not what i was expecting.  So, the waitress comes over and asks for our drinks and while she's doing that, she's blatantly flirting with my boyfriend. I don't know bout ya'll, but that kind of ticked me off. Anyway, I got over it and was just trying to enjoy myself.  It was kind of hard hearing my boyfriend in the bar area because there were tv's with their volumes up and older people kicking back after a day at work. My boyfriend asked another waiter if we could switch to the other side and the waiter was like ""why..."" and my boyfriend replied ""well it's just too loud over here and the other side looks a lot more quieter"" and he replies, ""well, its not that much quieter over there, it just seems quieter because it's a bigger space."" ....what? Like, what kind of logic is that? After a couple times going back and forth he finally said ""alright, then"" and seated us to another table. It honestly felt like we were such a huuuugeeee burden to him when we just asked to move tables. I work in the retail business and deal with customers all the time and if they're unhappy about something, I do anything in my power to make sure they walk out satisfied with what they purchased. I just dont understand why he was so irritated when we asked him to move. Isn't that his job... to make the customers have an enjoyable experience. The other side of the restaurant was not even half full. I'm the type of person that doesn't really complain while I'm there, so to get that kind of reaction kind of ticked me off.  The food was mediocre but when I got home, my dad told me that applebees just unfreezes a bunch of food in the microwave and deep fryer. So, I'd say if you wanted that kind of food, just go to a fast food restaurant and not waste your money and time going here. there are a lot better places to eat and that deserve your money in the area, trust me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=140

Once she took our order and brought us our drinks everything went downhill from there.  The food took forever. She brought out appetizers without bringing any utensils or plates but we were starving and just used our fingers anyway and didn't mind too much. Then it took a really long time for the entrees to come out. Steaks were burned which I get its not a nice steak house or anything but don't bother asking how I want my steak done if they are all going to come out medium.  Water was never refilled once during the whole meal. Asked for a drink refill and waitress acknowledged it twice but didn't bring it over until the end of the meal. Ordered 2 sides of sweet potato fries to go along with the steaks we ordered. Sweet potato fries arrived well after we were done with the meal. One of which arrived cold and unappetizing to which I wondered why the hell did we wait so long when the fries were just sitting back there?? After we informed the person that brought the fries (who was not the waitress) that we had two orders the manager personally came by and brought the fries and apologized for the ""few minute delay"" but never apologized for the terrible service. My brother asked for a frozen lemonade refill and the manager said they don't refill those to which my brother replied I thought you were the manager? He said he was. I couldn't help but laugh because the measly refill could've prevented the bad review. It was an opportunity to reverse a customer's poor experience at his restaurant. But nothing. To top it off the waitress finally came back and said here's your bill and check it thoroughly to make sure you know what you're paying for. I expected a comp on something, anything. One drink.

John L.,"Brea, CA",47,86,,1.0,8/10/2008,"This Applebee's makes me face palm. I'm not the biggest fan of mega chain restaurants, but I don't think they're as bad as people whine them to be. They're usually satisfying so-so meals that'll get the job done and have something for everyone at a reasonable price. But this Applebee's seems to try hard at sucking. I went to this particular location a few times. There aren't too many sit down restaurants closeby in the area, so people are pigeonholed with few choices. But at the same time, I suspect it gives some business proprietors a reason to suck, since they know people don't have a choice to go somehwere else. I think this Applebee's uses the same tactic. Their foods are overcooked, improperly seasoned, put together with haphazard presentation, and generously served on consistent platters of fail. This place can't even follow the tried and true mass production methods their parent company devised for them.  Case in point? Chicken breast dishes (several of em) that are all dry and shriveled. Steaks that haven't been trimmed for gratuitous gristle and are cooked above or below what you ordered. Appetizers that are half-assed and look like they were cooked with the help of an EZ-Bake Oven. Avoid this place at all costs unless you're going there to enjoy a beer or drink at the bar casually. I'm sick of these Norco restaurants thinking they can get away with serving second rate food to people they suspect won't bother to go elsewhere (and with gas prices the way they are and the alluring comfort of a place closest to home, I can understand).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=160

Sophia L.,"Chino, CA",223,259,124,3.0,8/29/2014,"Applebee's is very kid friendly, so we like to bring our kids here. This is the first time we've been to this particular one and the service was SO slow. It was the middle of the week and the restaurant was no where near full, so I don't know what was going on. Our server was attentive and the manager even came over to ask if everything was ok. (He knew the food was taking FOREVER) The food is always good, not great and it's decently priced so that's why we continue to come here. The best part about this place is the full bar.

Maria R.,"Fontana, CA",188,95,41,1.0,10/8/2015,"I'm kinda disappointed.  My sons reaction after seeing and tasting the food.  He said ,'I guess Applebee's don't care if their food suck as long as the photos nice.'.  He was sad although he loved the churro s'mores.. Oh well it seems like every time I dine in there's always a problem, bland food, servers not taking care of you.  Honestly curve side was the best when my husband and I had curve side service food was amazing and the person was really helpful and nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=80

I asked for medium well steak and it came out extremely well done and salty along with salty sweet potato fries and my veggies were soaked in butter they are suppose to be steamed veggies, they looked soggy and old. The other plate we ordered was the American burger it was missing the bacon and the fries with that order was ridiculously salty and my mom likes salty food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=80

Quoc T.,"Corona, CA",162,19,2,1.0,5/6/2016,Carside to go requires you to go inside. What's the point of asking for the make and color of my car if I have to go inside anyways?

Danmo H.,"Montclair, CA",232,590,1953,2.0,2/16/2015,"It's your typical Applebbee's.  We usually get the 2 for $20 and order the cedar plank chicken which is surprisingly good and one of their healthier entrees.  We were first time visitors to this location.  Food was fine.  The reason for 2 stars is because of service and the company's attempt to take that away -- on the table was one of those electronic devices where you can place your own orders, etc.  While a server did come to our table to greet us and get us started with drinks, etc., it was clear that he was overloaded with tables and had difficulty getting around and refilling drinks.  More staff was needed.  Sure there's that electronic device, but it can't answer questions about the menu or make substitutions to dishes.  It's also very impersonal.  And if you used it and received next to no service, why would you tip.  It's definitely going to hurt those servers.  Sometimes you just can't replace people with computers and or machines--this is one of those areas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=80
Kathy K.,"Mira Loma, CA",0,28,,5.0,7/6/2016,"My husband and I had lunch at Applebees today and it was very, very good. We especially liked the new menu and their efforts to raise money for children with cancer. We also like how the restaurant is trying to become part of the community by posting pictures of various schools and sports team. Staff was friendly and efficient. I ordered the Oriental Salad and Mac. & Cheese from the lunch menu and it was perfect size and super delicious.

Heather D.,"Corona, CA",1,3,1,1.0,11/1/2015,"Server was unfriendly, didn't introduce herself, walked away while taking our order, didn't smile. I think because we got the 2 for $20.00 deal she didn't care about us. The app hit the table and she never checked on us. Someone brought our dinner and still no server to check on us. I would've ordered a drink from the bar or maybe even dessert but none were offered to me. When she brought the check she didnt say thank you or ask if we wanted anything else. Such a let down. Definitely don't recommend this location at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=80
Katie D.,"Riverside, CA",4,3,,1.0,9/11/2015,Decided to go here with my husband and give this place another chance even with our bad history of them messing up our food. We waited quite awhile for our server and when she finally came she had an attitude. I asked to substitute the side for my steak for rice instead and she rolled her eyes and said she will ask and brought the manager out to clarify what I wanted because she couldn't grasp I wanted rice instead of quinoa. They undercooked my husband's greasy hamburger and didn't not refill my drink even after I asked for it twice within 30 minutes. Will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=80
Dave S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,37,4,1.0,10/16/2015,"So the All-Day Breakfast burger it is for myself and the wife. Both arrived about 15 minutes after we ordered and both were wrong. Nowhere on the menu does it say pickles are on the burger (we verified). We both hate pickles so we asked the server (Jesse) if this particular burger was supposed to come like this. He says ""oh of course, all of our burgers have the pickles."" So great, now we have to send them back while the kids eat and wait. Both came back looking and tasting terrible. We notify the manager who apologizes.  Long story short, even though both burgers were terrible (wife ate less than half and I ate even less), the server drops the bill off and says ""we took both burgers off, sorry about that."" I was relieved, I didn't have to pay for something I didn't eat. WRONG, he lied. He took one off and left the other. When I asked him, he pulled a used car salesman tactic and began circling things on the itemized bill and ran off. As he left I said ""ok, so you didn't take off two right?"" to which he replied ""both are off, yes."" Um, ok.  Times must be tough for Applebees. They really needed that additional $10.99 to stay in business I guess. Well, I guess I'll have to stick with one of the other 17 restaurants in the area from now on. There was absolutely nothing good about this visit. Thank you manager and Jesse for nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=80

Richard G.,"Corona, CA",3,10,28,3.0,5/31/2012,Went to Applebees for lunch today. Was not my best experience here. Now i have to say it wasn't really Applebees fault. Our hostess and server were both very friendly and prompt. We were just seated next to a couple of screaming kids that kind or ruined my overall experience here. I like kids just not screaming in my ears while I'm trying to eat.  As for the food........now first I have to throw out there that I'm the worlds most pickiest eater. I ordered the new fried green tomato and turkey sandwich. The sandwich sounded like a somewhat healthy pick but it was actually very greasy. Probably from the fried green tomato im guessing. The rest of the foods and drinks were good. Ive been here a bunch of times and had both really great experiences and not so great experiences but this rating is based off mt visit today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-mira-loma-2?start=80
