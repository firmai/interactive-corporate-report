82,Jenny C.,"New York, NY",83,586,516.0,3.0,2012-06-03,"It was Saturday night and I was STARVING. I didn't really care where I was eating at that point. My boyfriend suggested TGI Friday's since we figured Texas Roadhouse would be a 2+ hour wait or something ridiculous like that. At TGI Fridays it was merely a 20 mins wait (maybe less actually). We were seated in a cozy booth and greeted by our server Denise. She was nice and friendly but a little too friendly/perky? While she was quite helpful with the menu and ordering and bringing us refills without asking, she wasn't always around when we actually needed her.  As for the food, we had the spinach artichoke flatbread, which was decent but it was less flatbread and more matzo-type cracker. For entrees, I tried the spicy beer cheese burger which was pretty good, but I got tired of it after the first half. My boyfriend had the caribbean rubbed ribs which were pretty good. For dessert we had the salted caramel cake.  Overall it hit the spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=60,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

92,Victoria M.,"Levittown, NY",0,1,,1.0,2012-10-05,"Must have been one of my worst experiences at any restaurant. The hostess was extremely rude, did not greet me as I approached her through the entrance, continued talking to her coworker as I stood in front of her waiting for a number as there was a 30-35 minute wait for a table for 2. However, the hostess was completely polite and courteous to the couple just before me.  After being seated at our extremely filthy table (table surface, seating, and underneath were all soiled and crumby), we were greeted promptly by our waitress. We ordered and received our drinks and appetizers. Main entrée was served soon after; I had ordered the black angus cheeseburger. Ordered the burger medium, it was served fairly pink throughout, most definitely NOT medium, I could almost say it was barely cooked. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she insisted that I was wrong and that the burger was most definitely medium well. Completely irritated, she offered to take the burger away and quickly did so. She was short with us for the rest of our brief time there.

The absolute best item I've had here is the Jack Daniel's ribeye steak.  It is always tender, cooked just right and comes with an amazing, sweet and savory Jack Daniels glaze.  It is addictive.  I've eaten steaks at the best steakhouses, and although this is smaller and not quite the same experience, the meat is very high quality.  And the price is right for a quick, casual bite in the afternoon. The sides are surprisingly good too.  The parmesan fries are outstanding.  They are thick steak fries and come with a garlic sauce and nice shavings of cheese.  The vegetable medley has zucchini and yellow squash, my favorites.  I also like their wedge salad with chunky blue cheese and bacon crumble. My friend got a garlic shrimp dish and it was very good, but very heavy on fresh chunks of garlic so be prepared.  The nice new addition they've made is to serve our meal on cast iron skillets, so the food stayed hot throughout the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=80,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

Upon entering the restaurant my party and I smelled something really bad. Like not 'bathroom' bad, but almost like the smell of something extremely musty. Or honestly the spell of the extermination spray. Maybe they just got sprayed? However the restaurant had this horribly stale smell. Almost enough to make us want to leave. Stupidly we stayed.  We got to the table and I immediately took out the silverware from the incredibly wrinkled napkin ( I was hungry and ready to eat). I almost threw up when I saw my silverware was so dirty. It had these sticky smudges and gook all over it. Cmon really?  I am not a picky person but to have that nasty of silverware is unacceptable and it just shows the overall cleanliness of the store. Good thing we had a super nice waitress who took care of us right away! She was very pleasant!  Our food came to the table cold and not fresh at all. The food itself was nothing special and pretty lame. I could make better food myself at home with a few regular ingredients. It seriously was not worth the price. I should really be criticizing it more because it really was a joke. The two stars goes to there onion soup. I always get onion soup here, it is my favorite. Luckily that part of the meal was good!

First, two if the orders came out, and then about a half hour went by then a 3rd order came out delivered by the manager apologizing that it was late, and he didn't even notice that 3 other peoples orders were still missing. Well another 35 minutes later and the other three orders made it to the table. Also may I add it was there 10 special on three, all you can eat apps well more like when they feel like bringing the food you may be able to eat a few plates but you may have to dine for hours to exceed what you would normally get if you just ordered one app. Then the drink debacle.... Well they bring out two drinks in one shaker, and if they hadn't added a ridiculous amount of ice it may have actually filled up two glasses, but no such luck. The first time wasn't as bad as the second time. It literally filled up one glass and a sip in the other. Now let's get to the check... I guess Florida and NY are different in the question would you like separate checks, because that as well was a ordeal, and when it eventually did happen they just decided to add a whole extra meal that no one got at our table to my bill bad mistake since I am a huge yelper. I had to once again leave the table to track down the waitress that actually occurred on three separate occasions through out the night , and ask to please remove the charge, and never did I receive a canceled charge receipt   So the entire experience of the dining portion of the evening was a nightmare joke.

90,Mark D.,"Nassau, NY",7,22,9.0,3.0,2014-11-02,"Well, it is Friday's.  It was busy but not prime dinner time, under a 5 min wait for two. Some staff seemed to be super busy while others seemed to be dancing to the music being played and not working.  Our drinks came out quickly but when the chips and salsa seemed to take a long time I decided to check yelp.  I pointed out the poor ratings on service to our server and he stated ""I am not qualified to comment on behalf of the company, I will get my manager"". Humm... Sounds like he had to call in the legal department. The manager came out and notes they were trying to do better.  looking at the calories, they didn't have a burger under 1100 calories. I thought that was rather silly. The 10oz sirloin was only 570.  I am not counting calories here but a burger and pie and coffee was nearly 3000 calories. I try to keep under 2500 for the day!  The entree menu is really rather limited since I was last at a TGI Fridays over 5+ years ago. I ordered the 10pz sirloin with 2 sides. baked potato, and creamed spinach.  Out of baked potatos??  But they had mashed.  Humm.. Asked for creamed spinach  without the mushrooms the waiter notes were in them. The shrooms can't be removed.  OK, now I got it.  Their food is ""flash frozen"" and just reheated.  I asked if the mashed potatoes were fresh or a mix.  He went and pulled his manager over again.  I asked how is it you are out of baked potatoes but have mashed ? And are they real?  he advised they receive the potatos and the mashed potatoes flash frozen, but they are ""real"". The sirloin was not quite ""restaurant grade"".  The industry generally gets the best cuts of beef before consumers.  If you were not aware, you are now.  This was a bit tough and more consumer grade.  It was OK. But to be honest, for $23 for the entree I can pay another $7 and get a better sirloin and fresh baked potato and have my spinach without the mushrooms because it is made fresh not flash frozen much in the same way as ""first class"" airline food.  Great for first class airline food, but this is a restaurant. I gave it 3 stars because I suspect there is a need for a chain that you know what you are getting.  It will be rather consistent based on its manufacturing process, as opposed to ""cook"".  it wasn't great and it wasn't awful. It was good for that ""mass consumption"" style chain.  $55 for two of same entrees and a blue moon draft x 2.  OK.  Fresh in most places would have been $75-80. But I know some nice ""hidden treasures"" where you can get fresh for that price.  They are not as easy to find, nor as common as a TGI Fridays is.

They also didn't mention the Fridays want more stripes card at any of the Fridays I've been eating at! Our bill was over $600 and they should have payed extra attention to us. Just because a restaurant is busy should not mean bad service and long waits.  Fridays should be aware and equipped for that!

33,Steve D.,"Tampa, FL",3,17,1.0,1.0,2016-03-12,"Dear Mr. or Mrs. Fridays, I hope this message finds you well. My name is Steve and I have been a long-time patron of your Levittown, NY location. And when I say ""long-time"" I'm not referring to the number of years since my first visit to your restaurant, but rather the amount of time I have spent recently in this establishment.  I'm no stranger to TGI Fridays. I grew up in suburban Long Island, in the shadow of your original 63rd street and 1st Ave Manhattan location. Although my local Friday's was always your illustrious Westbury restaurant, I'm happy to say that I have sampled many of your locations throughout the continental United States and abroad. I've been to Friday's as diverse as the Fort Lauderdale Airport, all the way to the TGI Friday's Dundrum, at the Dundrum shopping center in Dublin, Ireland. Clearly, I'm no stranger to your delightfully tasty microwaved food, middle-of-the-road service, or moderately priced alcohol.  However, it has recently come to my attention that your Levittown, NY location is not living up to the run-of-the-mill standards Friday's has become tolerated for. In fact, if I may say so, every experience I have had at this location has been poor to unbearable. Allow me to explain. Although I would never actively go out of my way to visit any of your restaurants, your Levittown location happens to be situated within walking distance of one of the finest movie theaters I have ever visited. The AMC Levittown not only features reclining seats, but also offers pre-assigned seating. Why is this important you ask? Because simply, I no longer have to worry about getting to the movies early in order to secure a seat. But what has this got to do with Friday's? In a word, everything. By giving me extra time to arrive at the theater, AMC Levittown has opened for me what I like to call the ""buzzed window"". This is the brief amount of time I have to consume enough alcohol to make the first two-acts of any movie bearable. Realistically speaking, this buzz can only last two acts, as by act three I will likely be sober and annoyed, or asleep. I assure you, those recliners are comfortable beyond belief. Even if the movie is terrible, I still feel like I get my moneys worth.  However, the problem is that the only bar near enough to the theater is your TGI Friday's. Unfortunately, the service at this location is horrendous. Your bartenders consistently ignore patrons when they arrive, take forever to deliver orders, and in many cases are down right rude. Just this evening, I had my good friend time our transaction. It took 4 minutes before a bartender even greated us, and another 3 and a half minutes to get 2 simple beers. This falls far below even the mediocre standard established by your other restaurants.  I've worked in the restaurant and hospitality industry for ten years. Although I'm no expert in TGI Friday's, I like to think I know a thing or two. I've danced with a three-for-all on several occasions. I've stared down an ultimate margarita in the face without flinching. And I've got enough Jack Daniels sauce in deep freeze to keep me knee deep in flat-iron steaks and baby-back ribs through the zombie apocalypse. But your Levittown location makes me wonder if my preparations for the fall of society  would have been better at the Applebees take out window. Normally, I give restaurants a pass. However, the Friday's of Levittown has let me down in almost every way. No matter if it's a bustling Saturday night, or a Wednesday afternoon when I'm the only customer there. They fail every time.  After finally speaking up and saying something tonight, the manager gave me a business card for a free entrée. I'd considering going back to use it, but I don't know when I'll have the time. Sincerely, Steve",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,1.8280000000000003,2.6

First and foremost are the pan seared pot stickers. Chewy like bubble gum on the outside and pork product flavoring inside make for quite a pair when dipped in szechwan sauce. This trio delivers an abundance of flavor. Hibachi Skewers are another favorite of mine. So much flavor happening at once with the ginger lime slaw interacting with the garlic and black pepper soy sauce. While I think the Jack Daniels line is very hip and trendy, I see it nothing more than a gimmick. I also think the shrimp are frozen, but that's just my opinion.

The 3 of us who ordered the burgers got them and began eating. Before we knew it we were all done with our meal and the steak never came out. Maelinda asked how everything was and my boyfriend had explained that he never received his meal. She was sincerely apologetic and handled the situation by telling a manager. Usually a manager is supposed to apologize for any mistakes that has been made. Nope, not this branches manager. She BLAMED my boyfriend for not alerting anyone that he didn't receive his meal.

Tonight service was decent. Our waiter, Steven was good and on point with everything...drinks and food. Everything was brought out in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the Cobb salad with siracha shrimp. It was very good, and came with a good amount of shrimp. I also had a blue moon that was nice and cold..just the way I like it! Salad and beer? Of course! It's all about balance!  My mom ordered the the all American stacked burger. It had lettuce, tomato, cheese and applewood bacon. She rated it an 8/10. With the stacked burgers you can't say how you want it cooked because the burgers are very thin.  My stepdad ordered a turkey burger with avocado and sweet potato fries.

Yes its Fridays, I'm not looking for tablecloth dining, a late night snack with my teenager after a long day for the both of us.  Seated in a few minutes, great! order drinks and apps, one of the apps were cold, but we couldn't find the server, or any one to call attention to this. no one followed up when the drinks and apps were served. Had to get up and walk to the front of house. second course delivered, I guess now the server was annoyed, as she dropped the entrees and never asked if we needed anything...hello, we need silver ware, none on the table, we don't usually eat with our hands. empty glasses, and no question if we would like another drink or anything else to drink. we called over another employee and pointed out that the first glass was dirty, for which he apologized for. We also had to ask this other employee for silver ware to eat with, and also for another drink. Second drink came, and the glass had lipstick marks all over it. I am sorry 2 glasses both dirty. no follow up by server. I'm done. when we asked for the check, we got just that, the check. all dishes left sitting on the table. Do we know what bussing means?

The table ordered Jack Daniel's Ribs, Jack Daniel's skirt steak and the California Chicken Sandwich. It took about 35 minutes for the food to come out. The bus boy had stated that the sides of spinach would be right out, but yet, we had to ask the waitress to bring it out after 10 minutes. The ribs were quite delicious. The skirt steak was very fatty and did not have the Jack Daniel's sauce on it, which led us to believe that we were given the wrong steak. The manager, Marissa, came over and said she would take the steak off the bill. I ordered the California chicken sandwich which was suppose to come with a aioli sauce, but it didn't taste like any sauce was on the sandwich. Overall, it was still good.

The restaurant is not set up well for to go orders - you have to wait by the bar where servers are walking back and forth by the kitchen and there is nowhere to stand. When we arrived at the restaurant, they told us they thought we cancelled our order because apparently someone else placed an order under the same name and decided to cancel and the staff confused the two orders (oddly enough my credit card was still charged). Had to wait an additional 15 minutes at the restaurant while they prepared our order. The staff did not seem sympathetic or responsive to my needs and I felt like they just wanted to get us out the door. Even the manager didn't seem to care about the situation. The worst, however, was that after writing a complaint on their website, we were never contacted by anyone in customer service and I felt like we were completely ignored. Of all the places I have gotten food from, the customer service from Friday's is the worst. Their menu is also very lacking in any healthier options for people trying to eat lighter.

74,Mike M.,"MIDDLE VILLAGE, NY",70,57,,1.0,2017-04-23,"While out shopping today, this Friday's was in the shopping center so it was an easy choice to go. It was around 5pm that we walked in. Not very crowded at all for a late Sunday afternoon.  The hostess asked us if it would be ok if she sat us at one of the high top tables by the bar.  There were enough regular tables available but whatever, we sat where she sat us.  After a few minutes the waiter comes over to take our drink order.  We keep it simple....glass of wine and a beer. I put my appetizer order in for wings. Drinks come and we order our main course.  We each order one of the steak  choices, one cooked medium the other medium well.   Broccoli was one of the sides that was offered with the dish but they were out of broccoli so we had to mix and match side dishes. We also ordered a tomato basil soup. The wings came and they were very good, so food wise I thought we were off to a good start.  The main dishes came out in a fair amount of time.  A few bites into each steak, we noticed that instead of cooked medium and medium well, they were both barely medium...maybe even closer to rare. We were tempted to ask the waiter to take them back to cook to order, but he was busy correcting an error on the bill for the people next to us..... and also being hungry we didn't want to wait any longer.   We had some steak left over so we asked for it to be wrapped to go..at that point we realized we never got the soup we ordered. When the waiter came over to take our leftovers to be wrapped, he informed us the soup had been accidentally served to a different table. At that point we were done eating so told him just take it off the bill.    He took the leftovers and gave us the check, which I paid by credit card. He rang it up and brought it back to be signed, so we signed and left.  It wasn't until we were on the road that I realized he never brought back our leftovers.  This place seems unorganized.  From seating to service to how meals are cooked. I wasn't expecting a 5 star steakhouse, but I wasn't expecting I'd be writing a 1 star review either.  There are plenty of other chain restaurants on this strip of Hempstead Tpke.  Next time this one will not be a choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

I got the jack daniels chicken sandwich which was OKAY at best. It was very difficult to eat and somewhat dry. My boyfriend got the buffalo wingmans burger and requested an egg to be added.
