While all of this is going on, the tables in all other sections of the restuarant are also packed, with more of the club crowd looking types, as well as some of the general family crowd just trying to enjoy their wings and cheesesticks.  (At this point, the teacher in me was momentarily distracted from the hot club mess going on, and more concerned with, why the hell are there so many people bringing their small children out to eat at 11:00 on a weeknight? But I digress....) I stayed for a couple of hours and the whole time I just kept thinking, ""what is going on right now.""  Fortunately I had a hilarious companion with me whose observations summed up the evening perfectly: - ""Pretty soon I'm gonna have to be paying cover just to get my damn plate of cajun alfredo."" - ""You realize some of these people must have started getting ready at 6:00 to come out here tonight."" - ""There is a BMX bike hanging on the wall....and he is wearing a fur."" AT FRIDAYS.  ON A WEDNESDAY. Holy shit.

39,Jay B.,"Southfield, MI",0,6,1.0,1.0,2012-11-24,"Southfield lacks major chain restaurants like Applebee's, ruby Tuesday's, chills  and just about every other national chain that can be found on m59.... So Fridays has benefited from lack of nationally backed competition. I am sure this place is a cash cow because it proximity to Detroit and the fact that Detroit also suffers from the lack of big chains, makes this Fridays the destination for a lot of young people. I would not be surprised if its one of there top grossers in the area as there is a lot of drinking going on there.  This Fridays is not family friendly most days and weekends after 8pm, it's basically a night club with bouncers on the door and all!  If your not connected or a regular customer, don't expect to get a drink quickly. The food is standard Fridays.. So not much to say there, if you been to Fridays before and like their food.. It's the same stuff, just expect it to be poorly cooked and delivered too you slowly.  The restaurant is not very clean and during on visit when picked up tri-fold menu from the center of the table, it released a roach...  Needless to say we left!  I am young and thus many of my friends often force me into hitting Fridays before going downtown...  I don't eat, just drink. Good place to hook up and meet young people, I would not take a date or kids there after 5pm, management is rude based on the clientele they get... There has been a lot of fights and one shooting there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=40,1.3160000000000003,1.3160000000000003,1.3160000000000003,1.3160000000000003,1.3160000000000003

They also now have bingo on Tuesdays at the bar and Motor City Trivia during the week. They are definitely trying to compete to be the go to place for eating and drinking. I do like that they are starting up live jazz on Sunday's. Sounds cool. I still won't go on a Friday or Saturday night (Club Friday's), but the other days have been okay.

I would say the only real compelling reason to come here now is the bar; I say that without having ever sat at it. The Jack Daniel's menu used to be excellent but it seems to have gone slightly downhill. Pulled Pork Tennessee sammich is still quite good, but not worth the $10 in my opinion.

Nor do you get to FaceTime chat with a worker while they should be working.  This place severely suffers from some bad apples as I'm certain good employees quit and find a place where they don't have to worry about being assaulted. If the owner reads this, fire your manager.  You could double sales with a reputable person. I manage a multi-million company and this level of behavior is unacceptable and it doesn't speak well of the TGIF franchise. It's so bad that even the clientele suffers from ghetto-itis.

Toilet paper all over the floor.  Complain to my friend who said her last experience at another TGIFs was horrible too. (Why we come here Idk) Back to bar- bar is dirty at every seat. Couple minutes later bartender wipes up and asks what we want. Order drinks & apps. Ask for ranch, almost 10 min later here comes the ranch I ordered, I'm done eating at that point. Ask to see drink menu again & bartender has lots of attitude, can't find one, annoyed with us. We say nvm we'll have a beer. She walks around, 10 min ltr oh ya, a beer. We ask for check and box. Box is only thing that came in a timely manner.  Every single bartender was unfriendly, and seemed annoyed with every request we had. My friend tips far more than they deserved.  We leave, no thanks for coming, have a good night, etc.  Will not be going back to that establishment, and probably not to any others either.  Also the food was ehhhh ok.

We sat at the bar for convenience, where we were served by a woman named Tiffany. For starters Tiffany was very rude to us. When the meal concluded Tiffany handed us a bill at full-price! During Happy Hour! When I brought it to her attention she started yelling at me; "" well you just got your bartender in trouble telling, and this is the right way to do it. I would be crazy to charge it the way your saying""! I politely told her it would be crazy for her to charge me double for something that was half priced and clearly spelled out on the ""HAPPY HOUR MENU""! She corrected the bill and because i had to get back to work, I left my friend with the responsibility of closing out my bill. When i left, my friend called me and told me that she had asked for a cup of ice to go. The bartender took 10 minutes to come back empty handed and said that they did not have any more to go cups, only chidlrens cups and in the most Ghetto Fashion stated ""Do you wanna kid's cup""? Frustrated at the entire situation, my friend left.  The entire situation just did not sit well with me, so I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager Raymond about the situation. He informed me that they did in fact have to go cups and he had just had a conversation with the employee about her poor customer service.  The manager did his best to rectify the issue by offering me free lunch the next time I decided to come in. But what I didn't know is the next time would be worse....

Sunday night, not dead, but not super busy either. As at least one other person mentioned in a previous, really loud (football crowd at the bar). Like can't hear the person next to you loud. Not blaming the restaurant itself for that, but still very annoying. The rest kind of went like this. Seated promptly. First sight of server, probably 10 minutes later. Drink order take, easily 10-15 minutes before a beer and glass of wine arrived. We weren't sure on food, and made the mistake of not getting that out of the way. Because it was probably another 10-15 minutes before she came back for that. Ordered an app only, which took another 20 minutes easy. And then made the mistake of order another beer which took another 10-15 minutes before it arrived. I was keeping a look out for her to try to cancel it, by the time I saw her again, she was delivering it By that time, we were ready to go, and I drank about half of it before just saying screw it, let's go. Too tired to complain or have it removed from the bill. The one mistake I didn't make is when she brought the last beer, I had my credit card out to pay before she could even put the guest check on the table.   I don't think it was her fault, she seemed to be running around- they were either understaffed, poorly managed, or both.  Food was the only decent part of the visit, and let me tell you, it was mediocre at best. You could have made the same in your kitchen from jarred products and frozen food in 8 minutes. But my expectations for places like this are low enough that sadly, it was about what I expected so I wasn't really disappointed.  I was pretty involved in conversation, or I would have been far more annoyed than I was.  But believe the other reviews, this places SUCKS. Burn this bitch down!

I'll break it down into three categories: food, service and ambiance. Food- honestly, its usually good. Often times the menu go has items that are no longer available so prepare to pick a back of entree or two. Also they are very unaccommodating with substitutions, so don't bother with that. I usually only go when they are offering the endless apps but be aware it takes a long time to get the food, but it's usually hot when it comes.  Service- this is where it's really hit or miss. I've been there before and had waitresses that were on the rude side, distracted and short with you. I've also had waitresses that are nice enough but I guess from lack of good management they just weren't attentive enough and give off the impression they are to rushed to answer any questions regarding the menu.

14,McKenna W.,"Newport, KY",1,4,,1.0,2017-04-08,"Very disappointing visit. Called ahead at 3PM to make reservation for 24 people at 5:15PM. We understand we are a large group but like to think we are easy to serve.. only order waters and order quickly.  When we arrived the restaurant was not busy and the manager didn't seem to know what to do with us. We explained ahead of time and once we got there that we were fine with being split up into as many groups/tables as they needed. Waited 30minutes to be seated. My group of 12 was seated about 10minutes after the first group. Waitress was very friendly but seemed frazzled. Waited an hour for food to come out. First group that sat waited an hour and 45min for their food. Needless to say we were getting cranky and very hungry.  Suggest going in small groups. Reservations don't seem to matter...

Service was still absurdly slow, we waited over and hour for our food after ordering! Hit or miss here apparently so it's probably better to just try out a local restaurant instead. Biggest overall confusion was with their reservation/call ahead system and if it exists or not. We called at 11am and they said to call ahead an hour before. We called an hour before arrival and was told they don't do call ahead seating. We arrived and were told it would be a 30 minute wait (which we clearly tried to avoid). We asked if sitting 4 and 4 would help and she told us no and that we would be sat as 8 (giving us no choice) and then sat us in five minutes. The confusion and discussion was not a great start.  The restaurant wasn't very clean either. Food came out eventually and everyone had what they ordered for the most part.

0,Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1181,306.0,2.0,2017-09-23,"I don't go to Friday's often, but when I do, I really expect better.  My boss brought us here for a staff meeting and luncheon the other day, and it didn't go as well as we would have liked. (the food not the meeting. LOL) We walked in and the place was relatively quiet for a Wednesday afternoon.  Mostly a few tables of office workers having lunch with one or two folks sitting alone at the bar.  We were seated in the back since we were a party of 9, and our server was pretty decent. We had a variety of appetizers which were pretty darn good.  We also had a breadbasket which I liked since the bread sticks tasted a lot like the ones from Olive Garden. yummy!  Things started getting messy towards the end of our experience when the food started to arrive. Once we were all ready to order, she took our orders and off she went. The problem was tow fold.  First, our meals came out in shifts. like 5 or 10 minutes apart.  For a minute I was cool with it, but as she worked her way down the table, it got slower and slower.  By the time she got to both my coworkers spot and mine, it had been darn near 20 minutes at this point. to make matters worse, she realized that we had been the first two to order, and still had no food. The waitress frantically went to the kitchen to see where our food was at and realized that the cooks must have overlooked it. I  don't blame the waitress, but the cooks clearly weren't able to complete the whole order in a timely fashion.  We think they overlooked our two orders and just forgot. Our poor waitress apologized profusley to the point that by the time our dishes came out, it had been a grand total of 30 minutes.  Plus, everyone else was done eating at their lunches and the meeting was pretty much over. Even though I wasn't angry, the timing of the whole thing was off. I know we are a larger party of 9, but somethings going on in the kitchen that things aren't getting executed correctly.  It shouldn't take 30 minutes for a table to get their food if all the orders were put in at the same time. Also, when we walked out, I did take a keen eye to the rest of the place since we had discussed the slow service of food.  Things i noticed were multiple tables still with loads of dirty dishes on the end, a broken door handle at the entrance, an overflowing ash tray that clearly hasn't been emptied in days at the front of the store.  It kind of makes you wonder who's managing the place.  It's a series of failures all the way around that lead me to this review. I probably won't return to this location unless I'm dragged here against my will.  Place needs to work on their execution.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003

Now, I never write reviews and I know waitresses have a lot of stress sometimes(I was one for many years). But our waitress was terrible!. No smile. rolling eyes. cut us off when we were in the middle of ordering cause we didn't order fast enough',Complete bad attitude.  the meal took forever to come(for no one really in the restaurant). The place needs a total makeover! The chairs were dirty and had food in between the ladder back chairs and you can tell they were stuck on grease and food that's been there for a very long time. the floors/carpet needed shampooing.the ceiling were we sat was caving in from water damage.. The seats had a wooden bar under them which made your butt hurt LOL. just not a good atmosphere at all. BUT I looked across a few seats and there was another waitress that you could tell was having a hard day and she told her customers about it in a funny way and said things positive and she still managed a really sweet smile and laughed. She spoke well and served her people,without a grim face or attitude. How come we couldn't have had that waitress!!?? Well we finally ate and we only stayed 20 minutes after the food came. I have to say I gave 1 STAR* cause the food was good*  So the one person in our group paid the bill and left a really good tip for her(why? i do not know). but she had the audacity to come by, grab the money and said "" are you done? is this it? my friend said yes,, she then literally snatched the money did not say thank you, or have a nice day, or was everything all right? NOTHING just snatched it and walked away. Look we did not ask for any extras, never had her go get anything for us, we just took what she gave us. was pleasant and smiled at her and I tell ya' we got nothing out of this woman. I mean NOTHING! Terrible experience!. never going back there again. I have been to most of the Fridays and it was clean and wonderful service but this one is horrible!
