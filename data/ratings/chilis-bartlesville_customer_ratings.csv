0,Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97.0,4.0,2012-10-15,The food was OK... Typical. I do like Chili's. My steak was prepared exactly as ordered. So the cook must be somewhat good... And this was a Monday Night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bartlesville,,,,,
6,Justin C.,"Tulsa, OK",29,25,15.0,3.0,2013-08-15,"I tried the southwest burger and had them put it on a pretzel bum. It's delicious!!! Great place for lunch. Everyone know about chillis, it just depends if the one in your area is managed well or not. This one is, it's a nice place to eat during the week I think",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bartlesville,,,,,
5,Scott T.,"Bartlesville, OK",3,11,6.0,2.0,2014-09-20,"The chips are too thin for the thick Quacamole dip.  By the time you finish breaking off all the chips in the dip, you have to reorder chips .   And I don""t like that they want to kow if you want to donate to St Jude's, and if so how much.  Just let me eat and pay without having to make heavy decisions and report in to my waiter/waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bartlesville,,,,,
4,Melanie S.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",4,41,13.0,5.0,2016-06-24,Cassie (bartender) and Monica (server) are the shit! Great service and great food (ribs/tacos/triple dipper/BOMB mac n cheese)!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bartlesville,,,,,
1,Amy G.,"Union, Tulsa, OK",10,16,20.0,2.0,2017-03-12,"The food here is good for a chain restaurant, but the servers are terrible. It's one of a couple decent places in the Ville but the service is always lousy. Out of 20 servers maybe 2 are decent. We ordered and did not see the server again unless she was walking past our table, we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled, when we asked for more chips as she was passing she said our food would be right out, it wasn't. When we did get our food we had no silverware so we waited and waited and finally asked the manager as he passed if we could have some, he also offered us refills. It seems the servers here always want to give you optimum service right before they bring the check, sadly that's not how it works.  By the way this was on a rainy Sunday evening not rush hour full section filled dinner rush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bartlesville,,,,,
2,Sarah C.,"Tuttle, OK",9,2,,2.0,2017-03-18,"Food was mediocre. Waitress was nice enough. Slowest service ever. I shouldn't have to wait 45 minutes for a burger and a quesadilla. Don't come here if you have plans afterwards. It will take twice as long as any subpar establishment should. Maybe it's the ""small town charm"" but this really sucked, even for chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bartlesville,,,,,
3,Patrick L.,"Tulsa, OK",0,28,,4.0,2017-03-31,Had the classic burger. Fresh patty with usual condiments. Very good and reminiscent of the burgers I remember as a teenager (60 years ago)! Fries were perfect! Good choice for lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bartlesville,,,,,
