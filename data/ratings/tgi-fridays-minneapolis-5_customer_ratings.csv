40,Katheen C.,"St Paul, MN",0,1,,2.0,2012-10-30,"TGI Fridays has become a favorite of ours the last couple of years since they mellowed their presentation and most of the locations have separated the bar so that the dining area is much more conducive for conversation. This location is not like this at all.  The music is still being played far to loud and the bar is still open in the center of the room.  Yes, the decor has been updated, but that is the only thing I've see that has changed, and it is by far the least important change needed.  We arrived to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday and were seated right away. We put in our food order and......nothing. Forty-five minutes later, my husband finally snagged the waitress as she was passing to find out if we could at least get our appetizers. She did not apologize for the wait, or the fact that she hadn't even stopped by, but started going on about how busy they were with the hotels nearby full. Uh, busy? This wasn't busy. There were tons of empty tables. Besides, this is no excuse for ignoring us completely. If there was a problem, she should have at least stopped by to let us know and at least sound apologetic for the wait instead of lame excuses. We finally get our appetizers, which were good. However, we were not given any plates. My mother-in-law was setting her food on her drink napkin! Again, I couldn't find our server so I got up and found a bar back who brought us plates. At this point, we had already decided the server wasn't getting a tip, but, the problems weren't over.  They brought out our food, which was very good, but one of our party accidently knocked over her soda making room for her plate. She's trying to sop it up with her napkin while the man who brought the food stood there smiling askiing if she wanted another Dr. Pepper. What do you think? He then asked if we needed anything else and my husband asked for some napkins to clean up the mess. Unbelievable! He should have grabbed a bar rag to help clean it up, but didn't even seem to notice what had happened! Our server tried, half-heartedly, to seem for friendly, but still never offered to get more drinks and never apologized for the wait or lack of attention.  The only reason this gets a 2 rating is for the food, which was very good, but not great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

I will have to say I have been to the Friday's close to home and I have never been impressed with the type of restaurant this is, also the noise level is way to high to have a good conversion and just talk.  Well, that was until I walked in this Friday's it was very nice, the noise level was perfect to have a conversion with somebody.   I was happy to have this restaurant was within a few hundred feet from the hotel I was staying at.  Overall the food was good and the drinks were cold, so that is always a good combination.  I think what set this place aside from others was my server Ali, she has a smile every time she asked if I needed anything.  If you are going to come here, Ali is the person I would ask for and let her serve you and make your stay at the restaurant enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5?start=20,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003
30,Kelly B.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,13,,1.0,2013-07-29,"Convenience is what made us choose TGI Fridays for a ""quick"" dinner. The menu looked great, totally revamped and delicious. That's pretty much where the positives stop. Our server was entirely incompetent. He managed to forget my drink order 3 times. I ordered WATER! He came back to the table twice after we had our menus closed- just begging to order, and both times he had his hands full and would ""Be right back"" to take our order. He had the same urgency with getting out our food. It was cold, and clearly had been sitting for a while. He did a rushed ""check-in""  but didn't stick around to hear our answer to ""everything alright?"" well, it wasn't because our food was cold and he forgot our side. Never did get that. We then proceeded to wait 25 min with our credit card out on the table before he brought the check. Perhaps the worst part of the experience was the fact that there were multiple employees just mulling around looking incredibly bored. They clearly saw our credit card sitting out and never even told our waiter.  I thought the new menu meant TGI Fridays was new and improved.

We ordered drinks and before leaving he tried to repeat them, getting most wrong. He finally manned up and wrote them down. My mother's blended margarita tasted like it came out of a bucket. My long island was good enough.  Somewhat recently the menu was revamped, and it looks really well laid out. There isn't much variety though, salads, steaks, burgers and one or two pastas. I sure don't understand the continued obsession with the Jack Daniel's everything...makes me not even look at those pages.

The salad dressing we asked her for never came, our drinks were never refilled, and our waitress seemed to become annoyed with us as we noticed she was asking every other table if they needed refills or dessert, when all we got was a fly by dropping of our bill on the table.

14,Tim S.,"Edina, MN",288,207,941.0,2.0,2014-05-12,"Oh oh. Looks like I wrote a similar review in 2012. Could it be that Friday's is slipping? First, I know it was Mother's Day, but it was 3:30 PM between the rushes and we were sitting in the bar with about four other tables. Let me start with describing our server. The name on the receipt says ""Nathan"", but I'm not sure if that was just the guy who rang up or the guy who served us. If I had to use one word to describe our server, it would be 'lethargic'. I almost wanted to pull out a chair for him so that he could rest. However, he lost major points (and tip) because we had to ask several times for everything. In fact, I just went up to the bar to grab extra napkins after asking him twice and not receiving any. If I have to help myself, you lose the automatic 20%+ I start out with when tipping. Now let's talk about Friday's. What happened to being a valued 'Stripes' member? I put out my card, and don't even get acknowledged anymore? Fine, that's okay. But no more chips or free stuff? You have to print out rewards coupons before getting to the restaurant. Who plans that far ahead? So I ordered wings for starters. Friday's must have cut back on the wet napkins too, because we made a mess and nothing to clean up. (Hence the napkin episode I just described). I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken, and if you look at the picture I posted, it looks more like a Weight Watchers meal. I sent the picture to my friend who asked if it was on the 600 calorie menu. The rice was okay, but had too many ingredients in it and the broccoli was overcooked, which is a pet peeve of mine. It bums me out that Friday's continues to slip. It may be a good place to drink, but it's not a good place anymore if you're hungry. Good thing DQ is located next door.

It took about 10 minutes to get my drink. I gave the waiter my order.  Almost an hour later. My drink was empty, and my order had not arrived. The atmosphere was not enhanced by screaming children.  Meanwhile, I noted that customers who arrived after I did, had not only received their orders but had finished and were leaving. Someone, I assumed to be a manager, came over and told me my order would be up very soon. This is the same thing the waiter had told me at least two times before. She said she would be back in a minute. Five minutes later I put a couple of dollars on the table to pay for the one drink I had received, and left.

39,Kate C.,"Saint Paul, MN",34,24,,2.0,2014-07-07,"I will begin with the fact that we were in  the area for a large convention, but that we have done dinner on Thursday at Friday's for the past 8-9 years at least so Fridays is losing no points for a wait for a table or being busy.  We knew (or thought we knew) what to expect. We had the most mediocre experience I have ever had at this Friday's.  I understand that our server was newish but there are some basics that should be covered in training.  I ordered the pick three off the new small bites menu as my entree and specifically requested that it come with the entrees.  Nope 2 of 3 arrived as the appetizer and were served to the table as if we had ordered them to be shared.  The Parmesan meatballs were a little heavy but okay.  The bacon Mac and cheese balls arrived barely lukewarm and waiting for the entrees to come helped not at all.  When my husbands food finally arrived, apparently the kitchen is unable to discern the difference between medium rare and medium well.  The hostess quickly got a kitchen manager who got a correctly cooked sirloin to us quickly so good service there.  My third appetizer arrived. It was the ahi tuna and I must say it was tasty if a little skimpy on portion.  The server apologized for the timing and I joked that it was okay as long as they got the billing correct.  My daughter had loaded potato skins as her dinner and again the sitting under the lamps was obvious.  Nothing arrived together either which is annoying for a family dinner. So then the check comes and lo - the billing for the pick three for $15 is instead billed as three separate apps a price difference of $4.  The hostess was near and as we hadn't seen the server we showed her and she offered to get a manager.  The manager never showed but our server finally returned probably hoping for a tip and he took it and got the bill corrected.  All in all, the food and service quality seem to be on a downward slide.  Fridays, you can do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
22,Josh S.,"Minneapolis, MN",7,95,,1.0,2014-07-23,"I've never been a huge fan of chain restaurants and there probably aren't too many people that select a chain restaurant based on Yelp reviews. However, because of one recent experience, I feel inclined to write anyway. Many folks will see the TGI Friday's sign out front and say ""hey, I've heard about that place on TV"" and that will be enough of a gimmick to get them in the door. They'll come in, get served and leave their hard-earned money there and feel like they had a worthwhile evening. I implore these people to PLEASE seek out a another area eating establishment. The Twin Cities are bustling with restaurants of all types and it only takes a few minutes of research to find something that you'll like. Okay, on to TGI Friday's... People generally know that they're getting when they go to a place like this and since I was with a group of folks from out of town that ""really"" thought we should go there, we visited the location at 7730 Normandale Blvd in Minneapolis on a Friday night this past spring. This place is a complete joke. Don't spend a dime at this location or any others. I have eaten at many, many restaurants in the Twin Cities area and my TGI Friday's experience was BY FAR the worst. There wasn't even a close second.  Our table was dirty and we had to ask for someone to come and clean it off before we sat down. They showed up to do that about 10 minutes later. We had to basically sit down and ""not touch"" our disgusting table for ten minutes. Finally, our slack-ass waiter came and cleaned the table and took our orders. What can I say. The food was terrible. I got jalapeno poppers as an appetizer and they were cold in the middle and mushy on the outside. I asked our waiter to take them back and get me a fresh order that was cooked correctly. He told me that he would but they'd charge me for a second order and that ""I just didn't understand how they were supposed to be cooked."" BS. I know crap when I taste it. I just told him to forget about it. My ""bourbon"" burger was also quite craptastic. I'm not sure what they were going for here, but the sauce tasted like a mixture of ketchup and sugar and was grainy. They certainly didn't slack on the lettuce for the burger but skimped on tomato, onion and pickle. I didn't bother to look at the dessert menu. Others in the group found their food cold, bland and just really bad. What TGI Friday's charges for their horrible food is highway robbery. With a beer, my terrible appetizer and my sub-par burger, I left spending just over $25. I had poor service and didn't tip. We witnessed members of the kitchen staff screwing around in the parking lot through our dining room window. It looked like they were playing hackysack. Good night, no wonder our food is a joke. The cooks are more worried about being on their phones and playing games than making sure their diners have a positive experience.  The worst part of the evening was the waiter. He had the gall to ask me if I was going to tip him. Seriously? You have to ask the customer for a tip? Do you suck so much at your job that you have to ask me to my face for a tip? He did a lousy job of taking care of our table (there were six of us... nothing too hard to handle for most), he never asked if we wanted any refills, didn't even bring us WATER until we asked and told me that I ""didn't understand"" how my appetizer was supposed to be cooked. A tip should be something that is given for good service and not to be just expected. I didn't tip him and he knows why. To sum it up, TGI Friday's is portrayed as a fun restaurant and a great place to take your family for food and drinks. There is nothing fun about this place. Management at the Normandale Blvd. location has NO CLUE how to run a restaurant. If this is any indication about the TGI Friday's brand name then I don't need to bother spending my hard-earned money at this location or any other location.  This place may have been good once, I don't know, but it is now a total joke of a restaurant at all levels. Don't bother. Congratulations, TGI Friday's on Normandale... you might be the WORST restaurant in the Twin Cities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

The place can be either a complete ghost town or packed like nothing you've seen before, and there is no way of guessing before you get there.  I'll just say it's across the board average, the service and food is nothing amazing or different but if you need somewhere better than fast food give this place a shot.

I requested that we go back to this specific location when some friends wanted to go to Fridays again, and I asked if we could be seated in about the same area.  Got our seats, and our waitress was not the nicest.  I threw my receipt away, but she had black medium / long hair and looked like she could be in her 30's as my best guess of age.  She was really short with us, and didn't seem to be happy about being there.  When she dropped off drinks at the table she just set them on the ledge and kept walking without so much as a ""here you go, everyone.""  She needs to improve her interactions with customers / level of customer service.  Hopefully if I wait long enough to go back she will be gone.  She didn't waste anytime bussing our table either, the second we all stood up she swooped in to collect her tips and clean our table off (it felt more dismissive than anything since they weren't busy on this particular night).

Needless to say, this place next to the DoubleTree Hotel in Bloomington, MN was very busy!  I ordered ghost chicken buffalo wings with Blue cheese dip and a short Sam Adams Amber.  The Chicken wings were tasty with good heat and I would definitely order them again at the discounted price!  The draught beer at $6.49 a short glass is like drinking at the airports!  There is no good reason to charge that much on a short draught beer and I filled out the survey and informed TGIF of my opinion. With that action, I received a survey code for a free appetizer and so I returned tonight for some decent sliders (free with the coupon code) and a side order of some really FANTASTIC and hot seasoned fries plus another Sam Adams. With tip I spent $12.58 Average out the 2 meals and the value improved.  However I paid $5.49 for a happy hour beer which is still crazy and will keep me from returning to TGIF again ever period. TGIF menu is typical to others and ok but still has their alcohol way overpriced for me.  I am confident there are independently owned bars on Yelp that offer tasty food and better value.

Our server was kind and courteous and offered suggestions, both most popular and his most favorite. That was pretty cool. He was a little late with the bill but I think he didn't want to disturb us since we had some workpapers laid out on the table. It's funny that we complain if the bill comes to soon or if it comes to late! ;-) The food portion of the ""protein"" was fine; I got the chicken and shrimp combo.

12,B B.,"Trout Creek, MI",0,8,,1.0,2016-06-30,"First time at a Friday's for us. Kinda worried when we first walked in. No one at the door to seat us. Took a while for them to notice us (and the other groups behind us).  When we were seated, we realized how understaffed this place was. One guy taking care of about 10 tables spread throughout the restaurant.  Our service was slow and he often forgot to bring things he said he would get. Not entirely his fault because he was literally running from table to table, but it was an issue.  The manager seemed to spend a lot of time walking around but not doing a whole lot. He could have been seating people or helping with drink orders or clearing tables. Something to help out.  The food was fantastic when it arrived. Since it was her first time here, we did sampler platter of appetizers. Potstickers, chicken wings, pretzel and cheese, and loaded potato bites. Everything was delicious.  Steak and ribs had great flavor, even though the steak was a little bit grizzly. Would definitely go back again for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
13,Bill M.,"Northeast, Minneapolis, MN",5,5,,1.0,2016-12-14,Waited for a table for 5 minutes. Made eye contact with 4 different staff. No one came to seat us. Took my business elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

The hosts are always super friendly, and we always sit in the bar for happy hour and the bartenders/bar servers are attentive, funny, and have never messed up our order. We've been here four times now. We love the all day happy hour. Seriously, excellent staff here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
6,Emily P.,"Mason City, IA",6,32,32.0,2.0,2016-12-30,"I could not decide on the 1 or 2 star experience so decided to do the benefit of the doubt thing that we just hit a really crappy time. They were not overly busy so no excuses there.  Atmosphere was fun and I enjoyed the decor and multi level seating. Food was meh, not terrible but certainly not great. would much rather hit another restaurant of similar caliber for better eats. We started out fine. Appetizer of soft pretzels with beer cheese dip came super speedily and were great. That was the end of the greatness. We got a truffle stack burger. The patties were of Burger King size and quality and luke warm. My daughter got the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta, i would say it was the best entree ordered except it was literally cold. I am not a complainer but it was c.o.l.d. The rest of us got steaks. They were mediocre.  Size of sides is minimal and sporadic. One of my kids got a good handful of fries and the other only about 10. TEN we counted because wow.  The mac and cheese was actually good but small portion. They did take back the pasta and bring us new, which was then luke warm again. Not cold but not hot. And it took until the rest of us were done eating. They messed up a few other parts of our order but did fix them promptly. The food also came in 2 rounds they didn't have everything ready at the same time and oddly enough the cold food came out first. I am hoping we just had and unfortunate experience but if you can avoid this location I would stop elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
10,Tregg D.,"Glencoe, MN",5,2,,1.0,2017-02-12,Ordered the steak and shrimp. The shrimp never showed up later like they said after they brought my  steak.

5,Mary P.,"Minneapolis, MN",67,118,78.0,4.0,2017-03-27,I've been to this Friday's many times over the past several years.  This review got 4 stars instead of 3 because of our waitress who understood the magic of endless appetizers and congratulated me for being a champion and eating through 3 rounds of apps while my sister tapped out at just 2.  We went in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday so it was relatively quiet and we were served quickly.  There was one younger woman who walked in wearing incredibly short shorts and tall socks above her knees who must have changed clothes in the back to start work as the hostess.  That was rather unpleasant to see but oh well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
9,Rebecca L.,"New York, NY",0,135,46.0,2.0,2017-04-08,"10 years ago Friday's use to be the place to eat....now the quality of the food is bad.

17,David M.,"Lake City, MN",0,2,,1.0,2017-05-22,Worst service ever. Waiter 45 minutes for my food. That would be ok if it was busy.  Sad thing was there were only 10 people there. I ordered my food and three other people ordered about 15 minutes later. They revived their food and I waited another 5 minutes. The waitresses never came to Che when n me or tell me my food would be out shortly. What a waist.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
7,Stanley W.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",226,92,9.0,1.0,2017-06-16,I've been here numerous times with my wife and had pleasant service until this short small man at the bar refused to serve us and take our to go order because we weren't drinking. My wife is pregnant and she just wanted something quick to go. The bartender told us to go ask the kitchen. I was dumbfounded. I asked the hostess to get a manager. 5 minutes later a cook comes out posing as the manager? WTF? No wonder the reviews on this location are poor. Needless to say won't be coming back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

1,Jajati P.,"Morrisville, NC",0,9,,3.0,2017-08-24,"Well tried two days while my business trip to Msp. Day 1 was Good, with half price wine bottle on Wednesday night .  2nd day was disaster on Thursday night. 1st appetizer arrived after 40mins while not many customers. Happy hour beer was well priced. The appetizer was as expected, but when the main course arrived there was foul smell with it. The chicken jack Daniel was hard split and there was stinky smell from it. The shrimp side order was never arrived. After complaint about the smell, the cook arrived and offered to make something else and apologized about the main course. By that time the smell was upsetting appetites. I asked him to get the check. Glad he has taken off $10 from the bill. May be this was last time I would have meals at this restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
2,Carol B.,"Saint Paul, MN",1,58,,3.0,2017-10-03,"Somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.  We were there later in the evening but for dinner.  We shared the ribeye dinner.  I know it's supposed to be ""marbling"" which gives it flavor, but I thought it was fatty.  The service was ok, no complaints.  I wasn't crazy about the table we were seated at -- I wish I would have said something.  It was reasonably busy for later in the evening, but there was an NFL game going on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-minneapolis-5,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
