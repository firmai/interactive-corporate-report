Elle N.,"Suffern, NY",0,7,9,3.0,6/29/2017,"Review your bill carefully!!  Came here on a weekday afternoon with 3 children. As soon as we got there, there was no hostess and took about 10 minutes before someone sat as down. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. Food is mediocre. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants since most of the food is frozen, fried and just downright unhealthy. Anyways when the bill came, I couldn't help but notice that there was a ""table entertainment"" charge for $1.99! What the heck! Then I realized it's for the tablets that they have on the tables! It would have been nice if I was notified that there would be a charge for using it! Sneaky move!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet

Victoria R.,"Spring Valley, NY",72,36,,3.0,6/23/2017,We came on a Friday afternoon and we're seated right away even though it was pretty busy. Our server was nice and quick. I was happy with my food but after I ordered I saw the specials menu or new menu with better options and I wish I had seen that earlier.

Rob D.,"West Nyack, NY",34,11,9,4.0,1/8/2017,"This is a comfort restaurant for my family. What you would expect out a Chili's chain restaurant is what they deliver. I rarely if ever have problems here. My family usually orders a 2 ""2 for $22 deal"" so dinner or lunch comes out to around 50 dollars for all of us. I like their burgers, I get a variety of things from their menu but often times I get the bacon burger which isn't bad at all. This restaurant satisfies the needs for everyone in my family as my sister loves to get chicken fingers  (original chicken crispers). Also their fajitas are good! Other than that service is 90% of the time on point and staff are friendly and accommodating. Bathrooms are always clean. They have a sport bar area and general dining room area which are separated. Interior in general looks great, aesthetically. Place is great for families. Give it 4/5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet

I wouldn't be so harsh if it was merely inconsistent.  I have friends that work here, and i try and keep their schedules in mind so i can sit in their section.  One of my customers is local, so chili's makes a nice break from Five Guys. But why does the service have to be so incredibly slow?. It's not like they are even all that busy.  I don't mind the food; I know what to expect.  But I need a quicker turnaround because I'm punching a clock.  I'm sure I'll be back as a matter of convenience, but I'm also sure I'm going to regret it...

Ashley A.,"Westwood, NJ",117,192,440,4.0,3/22/2015,"Overall everything went pretty well. Our server was friendly and attentive and the food was pretty tasty. For starters we ordered the boneless buffalo wings, and they're always yummy. I however did ask for xtra blu cheese because it goes pretty quick and she didn't bring it out. For entree I ordered soft beef taco with mashed potato instead of the rice and beans. It was really good ESP with the fresh slices of avacado inside.

Didn't bring in food for everyone at the same time. It's like im getting no service at all.  Took down our orders wrong, even though when I wrote down & pointed menu selection for ordering food.  The server's name is Skye. Had to learn his name from receipt. He didn't offer us any opportunity to order dessert. I guess when he handed me the receipt, he's not interested in getting any good tips from us. I guess he deserved a buck for tip tonight.  Food is alright. Nothing too fancy or die for. I guess it's what we get. Would I want to come back? Nah. Maybe the spot at palisades mall would be lotta better. If you get Skye as your server, ask for another server.

I love everything about chilies the way that they are very affordable they have really good food for being a chain restaurant maybe it's not the lowest calories but who cares I'm skinny anyways.  I love the triple dipper I love the house drinks they're amazing and I've been coming here since forever since I grew up in Rockland.   loyal customer,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet

Orlando A.,"Hazleton, PA",0,10,6,5.0,1/19/2016,Let me start with the fact that I usually don't have a good experience at this location BUT the server this time really made my experience turn around 360 degrees... Michaelyn (Server name on my receipt) was my server and she is what every restaurant needs. She understands what sense of urgency is. She had a huge party and several tables and some how she made time and attention to everyone equally - she refilled drinks without asking. She also was telling the other employees to move quicker so she can get to the kitchen... Very impressive....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet

Gary M.,"Spring Valley, NY",7,13,,2.0,2/6/2015,"Each time I go there I keep saying it's the last. Without specifics, the quality of the food and its cooking has steadily gotten worse. The kitchen is definitely a problem. Serving..... I hate to be rushed but you don't bring the entree to the table when the appetizer is less than half eaten. Wait staff don't seem to understand that. And then there's that ridiculous device now on the table giving the wait staff even less of an excuse to come to the table and service properly. That's it for Chili's.

Sarah S.,"Santa Monica, CA",87,26,23,3.0,6/30/2015,"Eh. It was alright. I've been to better chilis. The waiting staff wasn't that great. It's tough that you have to use credit and it's hard to use cash because the waiter never stops by to let you say ""are you gonna use cash?"" So it's like whatever. Food is like any other chilis. Just a place to go to when you have no where else to go to tbh. But I'm not complaining about it. It's come in handy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet?start=20
Michelle M.,"Bergen County, NJ",577,679,44,2.0,9/28/2013,"I'm a fan of the Chili's chain in general, but this one has serious problems. Rude hostess seemed pissed that we walked in for a late lunch while they weren't busy. It took at least 15 minutes to get a waitress - and only after we flagged someone down (I guess the 7 occupied tables were a bit much to handle. Our waitress was nice enough even though she forgot our side order of guacamole (hence the 2, rather than 1, stars). The food was uniformly overcooked. Bathroom was disgusting.

Kim N.,"Nanuet, NY",28,70,9,2.0,12/1/2013,"It's a chain restaurant, so pretty general review. But this one in particular is soo slow with service. We waited over 15 minutes just to have our waitress come over and take our orders. The food took forever to get to us, and was on the cool side. And of course where we were seated, wasn't any better. It felt like the forgotten corner. We almost wore multiple trays of food as waiters were coming out of the kitchen while unsupervised children were running to and from the bathroom. We got here at 4:15, and didn't eat until 5:00.  The only reason I'll give it two stars, is for the fact our waitress was polite and tried to do her job. When she had a free moment or remembered us, she would get us refills on our drinks. Overall, I wasn't pleased. And most likely will not be returning to this particular Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nanuet?start=20

I also go there often with a bunch of ten or so friends and all of us enjoy it.   We go towards the end of the lunch hour when the waiter/waitresses have time to put up with our dumb questions and mixed up orders.   There used to be a great manager named Tony who was also friendly and helpful and we hope to see him back after he recuperates from a recent illness. Our main problem is that we find ourselves in a rut because we enjoy four or five certain dishes and tend to order them all the time, but it's fun and interesting to try some of their other specialties.

Mike A.,"Nanuet, NY",14,50,,3.0,2/19/2015,Ate here last night with my girlfriend. Its an a-ok place if you want a cheap meal and ok service. The service is a bit slow but luckily they have table side computers now where you can pay. No more waiting 20 minutes for the check. We ordered from the 2 for $20 menu which came with an appetizer and 2 dinners. The food was filing and we had enough to take home for lunch the next day. I ordered the cajun chicken pasta which was ok. There wasnt much sauce at all. It was actually a pretty dry dish for stating it came with alfredo sauce. I would strongly recommend ordering extra sauce with your meal.

Jen C.,"New City, NY",0,22,21,2.0,12/22/2015,"Ate here yesterday for a late lunch with some friends and was disappointed. We were seated quickly, and food was served quickly, but service was horrible. Took 20 minutes for our waiter to come back with drinks and same with the check. A bunch of the waiters were hanging out with their friends who were dining in (or something like that?) which preoccupied all of them and made it impossible for my group and I to pay and leave.

However, how you are treated makes or breaks the way things go. Case in point I was here with a friend for lunch and a few brews on a day off. The bartender was outrageously inattentive. There were barely any customers around and definitely by no means busy. She was more interested in talking to the regulars and playing with her iPhone then paying attention to customers whose glasses were empty for long periods of time.

Now, I've never had bitter ketchup but I imagine that this is what it would taste like. My sister got the chicken crispers which she apparently didn't care for too much either.

Cassiebobassie A.,"Nanuet, NY",0,19,,1.0,5/24/2014,"SLOW SERVICE. You'll age waiting to eat and leave.  So I used to love coming to Chilis. Me and my friends would eat and dine and laugh for hours. However, one day this chain started going down hill. This has to be the third poor experience I've had in Chilis. I have complained to corporate and decided to give it just 1 more chance to redeem it'self.  When we first came in we were seated and met the waitress in about 10mins, and she was very genial and pleasant, took our orders and got our drinks swiftly. She helped me make my decision in getting an entree. It was great until the going got tough. The restaurant started filling up and my drink was near empty. We got our food and were on our own. We ate and sat drumming our fingers until the waitress finally showed up, and waited even longer it seems to get the check.  By then my drink ran dry. She tried to refill it but it was already time to head out the door. My friend and I finally swore to never return - even if we are starving and on our last leg. Could've spent $5 bucks in McDonalds and sat in my friends car and have a better time than the one I did there. I mean I ordered Fajitas and they were good granted, but the food is like a 3/5. It's not going to burst my taste buds, but it'll do the trick. But eating out is about the experience...the ambiance...the atmosphere. NOT worth it.

Stupid business chicks and barely above high school looking groups of kids getting their ""drink on"" seem to only be there for the tropical looking drinks and not caring about anything else. Way overpriced foods and way-way out of line drinks that you never see the prices on and when you ask its a look of - so you want that? Nothing to look at below basic waitresses and bartenders make the scene even less fun and appetizing. Looks bad enough the service makes it a pure ""no thanks""!
