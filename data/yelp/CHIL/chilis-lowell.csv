Kim S.,"Lowell, MA",184,272,3892,4.0,5/8/2016,"Good selection of inexpensive ""Happy Hour"" bites between 3-6 PM that includes sliders, wings, flatbread pizza, sandwiches etc.  Their cheap margarita is pretty gross (all sour mix) but the Patron high end one is pretty good, although it comes at a heft price $10.00 ish??

Andrea L.,"Suncook, NH",0,10,,2.0,9/14/2017,"Ordered on the go for curbside pickup,  which is an AWESOME  thing.  Server was friendly.  My order came out a few minutes early and was nice and hot.  However,  that's where the good news ends.  The food was so over seasoned,  it's not even funny.  To the point where,  I couldn't even eat the nachos.  I ended up scraping the cheese and stuff off and throwing them on some tortilla chips I had at home.  Fajitas were also very over seasoned,  but edible.  Totally disappointed.  And from reading other reviews,  this is apparently a consistent thing with this location.  So I won't be back.  I'll make the farther trip to nashua location.  Never had this issue there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell
Erica L.,"Bloomfield, NJ",22,37,24,2.0,7/11/2016,"I'm only giving a second star because the man who delivered my meal was nice, other than that I don't have much that is good to say. I ordered the southwestern BLT toasted sandwich. There is nothing southwest about it and it was not toasted. Those are both manageable,however the sandwich came on a giant roll,and while the lettuce and tomato were well represented the bacon part of the BLT was almost nonexistent. I have included a photo because if I read this I would be inclined to think it was an exaggeration, but I literally was given a total of two pieces of bacon on the whole sandwich. This is not a supplemental meat for this sandwich, had this been a turkey club or southwest chicken sandwich with a bacon accent two pieces would be sufficient, but the prime ingredient in a BLT is BACON,so where the hell is it?  Second problem is that I asked for broccoli as a side and received french fries... These things are not similar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell

Addie M.,"North Chelmsford, MA",114,221,107,1.0,10/22/2014,"This review is strictly on the machines that chili's now make the customers navigate.  Apparently, waiting tables will soon become obsolete. Because now, instead of a server being responsible for handling guest payments- the guests are now required to do it themselves. So when I'm finishing up my meal, on a busy evening, enjoying myself, I have to stop what I'M doing, to do what your wait staff is being TIPPED and paid to do? Where's my discount- since I'm making their job easier and doing their work? You're turning their job into just food running? If that's the case- pay them a decent 12-15 dollars an hour and wipe out the 2.63 plus poor tips. It's bad a enough they do all the dirty work for minimum wage. How dare a company think it's REASONABLE to have the guest do a restaurant staff members job. It takes away the personability and the fun in being served.  I was completely turned off when I went there with a friend last weekend. So disappointing and sort of embarrassing.  The verde enchilada's were good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell

Chill lady, we still need to relax and decide, but poof came a check. The main thing that bothered me was she took away my Patron Margarita, the only ""new"" thing on the menu.

Nobody that was working near the register came to ask me if i needed help. Finally waiting for more than 15 mins,I finally got my order and when i checked it,they missed one item on my order and I went back to knowing that I would have to wait another 15 mins with the same dam workers standing there without asking me if I needed any help, Worst place ever and If this place goes out of business one day,I definitely know why and will never go there again.

Vezna S.,"Winthrop, MA",123,397,105,4.0,6/6/2012,"A little better than average We went inside and there didn't seem to be a hostess to greet us so we went down and sat at the bar.  While there, I was greeted by a blonde bartender who ended up getting my drink order wrong.  I asked for a Blackberry Iced Tea and she gave me a Mango one instead.  It turns out that she was switching shifts with another (much better) bartender so she probably just didn't really care.   The second bartender was great!  She was very attentive and talkative, I enjoyed her company.  I ordered the 2 for 20$ special, one for there and one to go.  I ended up getting the half rack of Baby Back Ribs with french fries for there.  To go, I ordered their Crispy Chicken Zingers and for an appetizer, I ordered their Nachos with Roasted Corn Guacamole.   The appetizer was great!  I loved their guacamole and the portion was huge!  I ended up sharing it with my brother and nephew it was so large.  The chips were thin and tasted like they were freshly made, loved it.  The Baby Back Ribs weren't all that impressive.  I felt like they were a little bland taste wise, the fries seemed to have been sitting underneath a heating lamp for a bit also.  I came home and tried a piece of the Chicken Zingers, they weren't the best either (Red Robins has the best).   The service and decor was excellent.  The bar area was great, especially if you want fast service without waiting for the waiter to come by your table/stall.  The food arrived quickly and seemed fresh enough.  The bartender was super nice, she comped me for the iced tea that the other bartender got wrong (she rationalized that it was because she was a blonde haha).. that led me to give her a generous tip.   Overall, the service was great, the food was average though.  I liked it and will come again.  Plenty of parking is always a plus",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell

Even the ""steamed broccoli"" is salty!!  Okay so, I arrived on a Friday night w/o reservation. Note to self: Always call ahead if you're going to have dinner on a busy evening. So, yeah we were seated in ..I forget where. This was two weeks ago. I remember establishments I've been to two years ago and I can't even remember this place. Needless to say, it didn't leave a good impression. Our server was rude and rushy. She spent time on her phone texting or who knows what right in front of us! She also forgot my fries and I had asked to replace the rice on my plate with veggies - she did not!  The food was, as I mentioned earlier, salty.

Tommy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,130,133,3.0,6/7/2009,"When you are ready to give up on the local scene, good ol' Chili's is here for you, ready to welcome you back with open, BBQ-sauce slathered arms. This particular Chili's shines on weekends (in the bar area) with A+ table service and fast, friendly bartenders. You want your food fast, you say? This store features a state-of-the-art computer system that uses customer data (compiled from every Chili's restaurant in the US) to ""guess"" which entrees are most likely to be ordered during a rush. Last week, we ordered the Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers meal and the Crispy Chicken Tacos -- both meals were delvered in under 5 minutes because they were already being prepared! I am not making this up. The concept of the chain restaurant bequeaths us with consistancy that the local places around here are sorely lacking. Great hours, too: open till midnight Mon-Sat, and until 11pm on Sunday. There's no place else that can touch that in Lowell besides a dive bar or a roach-coach diner, neither of which I want to eat at at any time of day. Obviously, almost everyone in the country has already been to Chili's and knows what to expect - incredibly tasty southwestern-style American food at decent prices, with a great selection of Margaritas and personable service. I put forth that this particular Chili's is one of the best I've ever been to, and I'm especially grateful it's so close to home.  On top of that, it's in the same parking lot as the local Cineplex, so you can walk off your 1/4-lb cheeseburger on your way to snooze away a lazy weekend watching the latest jack Black flick (or whatever floats your film boat). You can find us here pretty much every Sunday afternoon, sitting in the bar area, munching on some awesome tex-mex food and slurping down $1.99 margs all summer long :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell?start=20

Leoss T.,"Lowell, MA",0,4,,4.0,3/30/2015,"A few weeks ago at this Chili of Lowell, I enjoyed a lonesome night and indulged myself in their ""Ancho Salmon"" as a simple dinner. A few moments later after I self seated myself in the bar area, a server named""James"" introduced himself as my server. Moments later after placing my order and have only requesting water with lime. Lemon came upon my water; this is acceptable because they're equivalently the same.Throughout my dinner I enjoyed the bustling conversations and joyful laughters of fellow guests; while engaging in bites of my Ancho Salmon, it was crisp to the taste; however the broccoli that was accompanied with the Ancho Salmon dish was somewhat bland and could of been better off, if boiled longer and or drizzled with some sort of sauce, and the rice pilaf was slightly undercooked; Rendering the supreme quality of this dish undeliverable. However, Service was appropriate and attentive; despite the busyness that had occurred.

rich a.,"Andover, MA",0,4,,3.0,1/2/2012,"Hello, I wanted to write about the experience my group and i had this evening.  There are usually about 20 to 30 of us every Monday night and we have been loyal to this establishment for over 2 years, probably longer.  We were approached by a Manager??  towards the end of our night and were told that one of the bills was not paid,  and that if it was not paid, we would not be welcome back into the restaurant again..     Before I explain further, keep in mind that the servers seem to be overwhelmed at times. This is not to blame them, we come in late and are a little loud and confusing  as we move around and go out for cigarettes, ect. The servers do an excellent job. I believe the Management needs to know what is going on and also starting next week, we will be going to the Outback instead. We were not treated well by the manager on duty.  A good amount of us have restaurant experience, such as myself as a Manager for 3 years. Also we have cooks. chefs, waiters and waitresses in our party regularly.

Jacqui C.,"Salem, MA",0,23,1,2.0,8/13/2012,"As chain restaurants go, I tend to like Chili's.  The food is usually good, the service is pretty quick, and if you go at the right time you can get fast service, good food, and it is a good experience.  Not this weekend!  We went on Saturday, around 3pm for a lunch/dinner.  We wanted to get in and out quickly and thanks to some bad service that did not happen. At 3pm it wasn't all that busy.  We didn't want to be in the bar so the hostess sat us in the dining room area, but an area with NO other patrons.  Not only were we the only ones in this area, we were sat behind a wall so that we couldn't even see the rest of the room.  This should have been our first clue.   As if fated, our waitress forgot about us often.  We put in a drink and appetizer order and quite some time later she showed back up and ran off, without our dinner order.  About 20 minutes later she stopped back, took our dinner order and promised to bring us refills.  She must have forgotten to put our dinner orders in because about 15 minutes later she showed up with our drink refills and no dinner.  Another 10 minutes went by and in came our dinners.  We were done with our drinks by the time they arrived.  No, my wife had asked for the additional avocado slices on her salad and when the salad arrived, after the waitress took off....no avocado slices. I asked for napkins as we had none....never got them.   Never got another drink refill.   The next time the waitress showed up it was about 10 minutes after we had finished our meals.  The hostess must have warned her because the waitress came flying around the corner, asking us if we wanted more to drink, if we were all set, if we wanted dessert, etc.  When we said no she magically produced a bill out of her pocket.  That she was ready for. We left quickly after that, as she was quite quick to respond to our desire to pay by credit card.  Well, if that was all she was after then she shouldn't have been surprised by our small tip.  Personally, my wife wanted to give her 5% because she was so pissed off.  I convinced her that 10% was fair, as I was feeling generous.  Overall, had the service been better it would have been a typical visit to Chili's, but I think next time we'll opt for Outback Steakhouse instead...at least we've never waited THAT long for our food. ****Update: Gave it one more shot last week and had the same horrible experience but this time the entire room was crowded and we were still being ignored.  Not making the same mistake again.  Shame on me for hoping they'd improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell?start=20
