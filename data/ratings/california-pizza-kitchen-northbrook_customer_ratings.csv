31,Valerie D.,"Deerfield, IL",447,613,101.0,5.0,2012-11-13,"The manager of this CPK, Randy, deserves mad props.  Last Thursday, a local animal shelter, (Orphans of the Storm) was doing a fundraising event with CPK, where, if you brought in a flyer, this CPK would donate 20% of your bill to Orphans.   My boyfriend's mom volunteers heavily with Orphans.  Last Thursday also happened to be her birthday.  So, where else would we go for dinner? CPK does not take reservations.  You can, however, call ahead to put your name in. We had a large party (15) and there was another large party (12) ahead of us on the list.  We didn't mind at all, the restaurant was jam packed, with people using their Orphans of the Storm flyers.  So, we moseyed on over to the bar to have a drink and wait.  And wait we did.  This location is one of the smaller CPK's I've seen, so waiting for a space where 15 people would comfortably fit took awhile... again, which we had NO problem with. We all ordered drinks, and a few appetizers/small plates for the group to nosh on while we waited.  Randy was very apologetic, to which we kept telling him it was no problem.  Well, Randy, is awesome, as I mentioned earlier.  He picked up our bar/appetizer tab.  That's probably 30 drinks and 6 appetizers.  Because we were waiting so patiently.  Taken care of.  On top of that, he said that he'd still give 20% to the shelter.  When we were seated, we all ordered another round of drinks and dinner.  There were a lot of tasty things on the table.  I opted for my usual, pear and gorgonzola pizza.  They changed the crust, some of the pizzas are now offered on a more Neapolitan style super thin crust.  I asked the server if she liked the new crust, and she said it was even better than the original, so I tried it, and it was really good.  I'll definitely continue to get the super thin crust. So, a great experience for a great cause, and will definitely return thanks to Randy's generosity, as well as good food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook?start=20,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003

Visited the Northbrook location as I was meeting a friend and it was a central location. Had a ""small plates"" coupon so we opted for the Chicken Tinga Quesadillas and they were pretty good. My friend ordered the Thai pizza of which he is a big fan (as am I) and I went with the Kung Pao Spaghetti (which I substituted penne pasta as it's much easier to eat). That was good as well.  The waiter did a fine job of taking care of us and keeping the beverages full. The only criticism I'd have of any magnitude, was compared to Deer Park, this is a ""low energy"" location. Not sure if it was the lighting, the music or something else, but if you dropped a feather in this place, you'd probably hear it hit the floor.

40,Brandon-Dawson W.,"Forest Park, IL",33,6,,1.0,2016-01-28,"I recently had a poor customer service experience at the Northbrook, IL location. I placed an online order with a confirmed curbside pickup time of 11:54AM. I arrived on-time and parked in a curbside pickup designated parking space. I waiting approximately 5 minutes assuming someone would eventually come out and bring the order since I had to identify my vehicle when placing the order. That could very well be an erroneous assumption on my part. I noticed there was a phone number to dial on curbside parking sign so I quickly dialed it and let whoever answered the phone know that I was waiting outside. Well, 10 minutes go by without anyone bringing the order to my vehicle so I walked inside the establishment to inquire. After waiting a few minutes in the carry-out ""line"" (there was no one in line, it just took awhile for someone to help me which is understandable since it was prime lunch time), someone asked if I needed assistance. I told him I was there to pick up a curbside order and that I called about 10 minutes ago. I told him that I was scheduled to pick up my food 5 minutes before noon and it appears at the time (12:15PM) that my food wasn't ready. He said the food was ready. Clearly, the food wasn't ready at 11:54AM when it was originally scheduled or else I wouldn't be still at the location at 12:15PM. He then, in a disgruntle manner, states that the food was ready and begins to cause quite a scene. At this point, I'm rather frustrated and a few of his employees took notice of our disagreement. I asked to speak with the manager. He stated he is the manager. I asked for his name. He said his name is Mike. Then I asked for his last name for which he scoffed instead of responding. I promptly let him know that I would not be returning back to his establishment. I honestly don't expect to be treated like that by anyone in the service industry let alone a manager in the service industry. I plan to post a review on Yelp describing the poor customer service as soon as possible. On a happier note, the food was rather good. It's just too bad that it was overshadowed by the tasteless behavior of the CPK's manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
14,Corin A.,"Glencoe, IL",26,7,3.0,1.0,2016-02-01,"Ok, I've been here a few times and I've only had a bad experience about 3 or 4 times and every time it was with ONE server in particular! I don't know why she is THAT much different than EVERYONE else but she is the ONLY server I have EVER had problems with! The place is AMAZING and I LOVE it but every time I get seated in her section, I KNOW I'm going to have problems!  I can't think of her name right now but if I do I'll update my review. All I know is that every time I get her, the food comes slowly and usually isn't at a normal hot out of the pan temperature, and sometimes with things missing or it takes a long time for her to grab something she may have forgotten.  Tonight my boyfriend and I came in (again I'm a regular to this establishment so I'm actually on a first name basis with most of the staff) and we ordered water right away, she forgot one of the waters and had to go back. I asked her for bread, the oil, and some grated Parmesan cheese (which I was told by another server is how you ask for the Parmesan cheese on the side in a separate bowl instead of getting shredded cheese in the oil) she then told us it was going to be 10 minutes for the bread. Fine, we would wait because then it would be hot and delicious. NOPE! It was hot but it was mostly the crust and SUPER flat! I'm sorry but I didn't wait 10 minutes for flat bread.  So, after that my boyfriend and I ordered our dinner, I got the spaghetti and he got a flatbread. I just happened to look over into the kitchen as she was grabbing my boyfriend's flatbread fresh from the kitchen and then she grabbed mine FROM THE WARMER! I mean come on! It wasn't even that busy! They should've made our food together or made mine after my boyfriend's so they would both come out hot not just ""warm""  Anyways, today was a really bad experience for me but I will definitely be back ONLY because I know all the other servers are way better at actually serving people in a timely manner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northbrook,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

The interior is very inviting and the large booths set a very comfortable atmosphere. Although you may expect this place to only offer pizzas, they offer a variety of foods like fish, pasta,sandwiches, and salads. For my entrée, I ordered the Shaved Mushroom and Spinach flatbread. I absolutely loved it because it was not overly filling and the sprinkled parmesan made it delicious. I like to think that flatbread is another name for ""healthy pizza"". My guest actually did order healthy and settled with the Roasted Veggie salad. She said her salad was great...especially with the grilled chicken.

What a joke of management CPK has at their Northbrook location.  ----------------------------------- Don't ever consider using their curbside pick up service. I did and I'm sorry that I did.  I pulled up curbside at the appointed time, phoned the number they gave me and pressed ""2"" as directed to let them know that I was outside waiting. The phone rang 5  times then disconnected. I called again and it rang 15 times, no one answered and then it disconnected again.  Fed up, I parked in their designated parking lot pick up parking place and walked in. It was bedlam.  When I finally got noticed and gave them my name, they brought out my order and swiped my credit card (twice because it didn't take the first time).  They put two pizzas, a shrimp fettuccini and a package of arugula in a huge paper bag and two soft drinks in a holder.  I took it all home.  When I got home my wife asked me where was her pear and Gorgonzola with arugula pizza? Yep, the shorted me one pizza. We called and they claimed to have chased after me with the pizza. I think not as I was still loading the bag and soda in the car for a few minutes.  They said to come back for the pizza they forgot to give me. I said no thanks as it was 22 degrees outside and I just wanted to give me a credit card credit for the missing pizza. They said that they couldn't do that.  I again asked for a credit to my credit card but was told that they don't do that over the phone and wanted me to come in personally for them to issue a credit (WTF). I then asked to speak with a manager (Joe was his name) and he too wanted me to come in for a credit. Bad business practice.  I then asked him how much credit I would receive towards my next visit (""just mention his name next time you come in"") and, unbelievably, he DIDN'T KNOW. He no clue regarding prices on his own menu!  WTF again! He had to pass me back to the front desk to get the amount. The girl at the front desk phone told me $5.99 then changed it to $9.99. WTF another time. We looked their menu up online and it should have been $13.79 plus tax. Take my advice.  Don't forget to double and then triple check any take out order.

Then he came to take our food orders and after then it went down hill.  25 mins later he came by to tell us that he forgot to put in our food order and of course we were a little upset so we asked for a discount, but then the manager told us the best thing she could do is give us free dessert and we said yes. So the young man put our order in and our salad came first but then about 25 mins later passed by and we asked our server where our pizza was and he said he will check on it. Then the manager came by and said that the order didn't go through. They let us walk out without paying for our salad and drinks and to come in next time and she will get our pizza (didn't sound like that will be the case), but it sucked that that was our experience.  I felt like the manager was new and had no idea what she was doing. She was even trying to run food, but didn't even know where to take the food.
