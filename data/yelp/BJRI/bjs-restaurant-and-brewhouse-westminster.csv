Kari C.,"Columbia, MO",62,17,1,4.0,7/30/2017,"Stopped in for a late night dinner on a Saturday night and the place wasnt too busy. We were seated right away and placed our drink order within a couple minutes. The waitress was very nice, as was the waiter who brought us our food.  My only complaint is that the chicken in my chicken pita tacos was a bit dry, but the food was really good. The place didn't blow away my expe tations, but the experience was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster
Douglas F.,"Tiburon, CA",687,451,294,2.0,1/8/2018,"I've been to BJ's in several states. This location was not good.  The Service was average, 3 stars, wha5 you expect, but no more. The food was a flop. First time I've  not enjoyed the buffalo wings, they were poorly cooked and cold. The other dishes were also not hot and lacked flavor.  We won't visit this location in the future.  We like BJ's, just not this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster

We ate here in the past and didn't have good service and the food was nothing special and hadn't been back however, we went to go to Bonefish next door and it was closed so we decided to eat here very poor choice.

John K.,"Irvine, CA",61,100,749,4.0,6/29/2017,"I've been to several different BJs in California, but the deep dish pizzas here are a little different.  I've been to this location several times already whenever I'm in town, and the crust always comes out soft and more doughy, rather than crispy and crunchy that's almost like it's fried in oil.  I know it's all a preference of taste, but if you like the soft breadlike type crust, then you would enjoy it.  The avocado egg rolls here are just how they are at other locations and delicious!  Clam chowder is always good here... thick and hearty.  I usually use the BJs phone app to pre-order so that when I arrive, they start the cooking, but the last 2 times I've been there they seem to not find my order so I've had to put it through with the waitress again.  Anyways, can't go wrong with the food here for the most part!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster
Erica F.,"Denver, CO",100,701,8,2.0,10/11/2017,"Really a pretty boring and bad chain restaurant. It's good for sports fans, there are tons of TVs (too many for my tastes.) Full of kids. When we were being seated, the host walked us by easily six empty two-top tables in a not-busy section, and attempted to to seat us next to a huge group of like 10 people with a bunch of kids. Oh hell no. For food, I got a bbq chopped salad and it was a huge mount of iceberg lettuce topped a thin layer of chicken and cheese.  Not worth the $15 price tag.

Todd A.,"Westminster, CO",45,165,38,5.0,9/20/2017,BJ's menu is gigantic you almost have too many options to choose from but once you get to know what's good it's not too bad at all. I love that they brew their own versions of sodas that the kids can have with unlimited refills this is a very nice option for families I do really like the root beer.

Kevin L.,"Thornton, CO",33,81,9,3.0,2/12/2017,"This place has a good atmosphere, and some pretty good food too. The wait times are long on the weekend but they impliment a texting feature that lets you know when your table is ready. That's a nice touch that all places need. The staff is friendly and they have a good selection of beers and wines.  The food is pretty good, but the price is a little steep. We got two entrees, Steak and some sort of Shrimp Pasta, both got a pint of beer and a single appetizer and the bill was over $70 bucks. I wasn't disappointed in the quality of the food but I would expect a bigger piece of meat and some gravy on the mashed potatoes. The side salad is larger than expected which is nice, the Shrimp Pasta was alright, the sauce didn't taste like anything special but the shrimp was cooked how it should be. It wasn't gummy or under cooked. Just right. I'll go back for special occasions but not on the regular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster

Rob G.,"Henderson, CO",118,19,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Just ate lunch here and it was average at best. The worst part was that we waited an hour for our food. It was ridiculous. And even while we were waiting, we didn't get drinks and refills very often. Our waitress said that they got slammed all at once, but the restaurant was less than half full. I've had bad experiences like this a couple of other times, but this was the worst. To the manager's credit, she did discount our bill and gave us a free dessert.

WOW, what a debacle! they didn't know what table any of the food was for, people who ordered first got theirs last, just bad service. Make sure you order your drink when your about half done cause it will be quite a while before it's delivered. Our waiter said the bartenders were upset at how busy they are.

Brittnie H.,"Broomfield, CO",124,22,1,2.0,4/10/2017,"First of all, let me start by saying this review is not about the front of the house staff, they were great. However, the kitchen staff is a different story. When we received our mozzarella sticks they were ice cold, they hadn't even cooked them! I was sick to my stomach, our server was very apologetic and brought us out another plate for no charge. My boyfriend and I both ordered pasta that was cold and tasted like it had only just been reheated. Of course the beers on tap are always a good choice, but I think I'll have to take on dinner at BJ's next time, unless it's $3 Pizooki Tuesday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=20

Christopher S.,"Minneapolis, MN",55,282,772,3.0,11/11/2015,"Went into BJs with a party of four.   Overall, they have good bar food.  Nothing our party had really knocked your socks off...it was good American food at a decent price.  The beers that they brew are really good, and I believe the main reason folks go to BJs...they have 4-5 of their own beers. We enjoyed some of their micro-brews at the bar and really liked the Red as well as the Brown Ales.   We sat down at a table and had good service, however, I always felt like I was being a bit rushed (ready to order?  We just sat down and the menu is at least 10 pages of drinks and food!).  We ordered the cheese dip and it was very good! Our party ordered burgers, a steak, and a tuna salad.  All were hot and fresh. The menu is quite large, full of American dishes.  Everything here was just fine, and reasonably priced.

Kaylee W.,"Littleton, CO",0,1,,2.0,10/2/2016,"I went to BJ's to watch a Broncos game. I walked in and sat down at the bar. As soon as we sat down, a server walked up and began talking to the bartender and another server about how he was about to ""explode with hate"" and was apparently upset that people go to a bar to watch football. He complained about the tips he had received and he complained about people who stayed too long.  Overall, it was very off-putting. As a customer, it seems really inappropriate to know what other customers have tipped. I knew I was there to watch the game and had planned on, ordering a few beers and staying a while. I felt uncomfortable and moved to the other end of the bar. It's too bad that this guy kind of ruined the experience.

Marianne L.,"Boulder, CO",212,142,34,4.0,3/8/2016,"I'm guilty of eating here a few times a week. The Southern fried chicken is wonderful and dependable for deliciousness. It really does feel comforting. (Food coma style.) The menu is huge - you can find something for just about anybody. The service is hit or miss at times, but overall it's been good. The lunch menu is priced very well!!!  Dinner can get pricy but you get more food, like everywhere else.  The pizookies are awesome. The monkey bread is seasonal but give me just about anything covered in cinnamon and sugar and then leave me in a corner by myself. And don't look at me. It isn't pretty, but I'll be happy for the next year or two.  Overall they've mastered cooking chicken. I'm no chef but every time I cook chicken it's been hit or miss with tenderness and juiciness. Not here. My SO and friends have ordered other chicken dishes, and 9 out of 10 it's cooked perfectly. I need the secret!!  Perfectly!! Almost every time I tell myself to try something new, but the thought of buttermilk fried chicken on a bed of mashed potatoes and surrounded by a ring of corn kernels (ok I admit butter makes everything better) when I actually sit down is more than I can resist.  I don't often clean my plate (unless portions are small and I'm still hungry), but I have managed to clean it every time here.

Tried making a group reservation to get together with family and wasted about 10 minutes with them beating around the bush before being transferred to Tim who said that they don't do group reservations on the weekends.

It doesn't guarantee a table as soon as you walk in the door, but...."" (I've heard this song before... I know better) Me: ""Well, Tim, how long would you expect the wait to be with call ahead seating?"" Tim: ""Well... you never know.... it could be 45 minutes to an hour"".

H A.,"Denver, CO",0,4,,1.0,1/21/2017,Ordered a skinny margarita and it was horrible! It was so sour I couldn't even drink it and sent it back. My food was over salted and the beans and rice had so much chili powder I couldn't eat half of it. There was about a half teaspoon of chili powder sitting on the edge of the plate. I would have said something to our waitress had she bothered to come back and check on us. She didn't come back until she brought the check - and charged us for the skinny margarita that was too disgusting to drink. She did take it off the bill after I pointed it out. This was our first time here. The food is definitely not worth the price. There are plenty of other restaurants in this area. I would recommend staying away from this one!

Cait L.,"Littleton, CO",16,113,36,4.0,1/28/2016,"It's official, I'm obsessed with BJ's. This has got to be my favorite restaurant. This location has great wait staff, and the manager always seems to be walking around, checking on all the tables to see how their experience is going. However, the host/hostesses, in my opinion, are awkward! Really, every time I come in I feel like it takes them a good minute to realize there is someone standing there (I'm short... but I'm not THAT short), or they talk in groups amongst themselves while getting your menus together and then just walk away, assuming you'll follow I guess? That is my one and only gripe about this place.         We've tried their honey sriracha brussels sprouts, and BJ's original chicken wings as starters, and they are both super good. I could eat their brussels sprouts every day. We've enjoyed a variety of entrees, fish and chips (malt vinegar included, thank you BJ's), their enLIGHTened turkey burger, spaghetti and meatballs, and their chili is really good too! The menu is huge, and it's all delicious, so it's a great option to bring your picky relatives to, if they can't find something at BJ's...well, they're ridiculous people. Of course you can't forget about the amazing Pizookies for dessert, so yummy.        But the shining star that brings me back time and time again...is the Berry Burst Cider, folks, this is the real deal. It is perfectly tangy, just the right balance of sweetness, oh my gosh...it is just the bee's knees...and if you visit BJ's and don't give it a try, you're a foolish human! Just kidding, but really, it's a sin to not drink a Berry Burst or 3 while you're here ;) Looking forward to my next visit, awkward hosts and all.

Our server, Melissa F., was friendly, went out of her way to accommodate special requests and she was very attentive. We came to celebrate our son's 8th birthday and we were two adults and four kids (12 and under). She was fine with the kids switching out their drink choices on refills, she patiently waited while they selected pizookie choices, and she created every request with a cheerful attitude. When we got our bill we were shocked to find that our 8 and 6 year olds had ordered the adult fish and chips, since the kids menu didn't have this option for them. The manager listened to our situation, and despite the fact that it was our error, helped us out by giving us a 50% discount on both of the boy's meals.

Though last time when we were there, we had such a horrible experience, I decided to give this another try. And it was delightful. We sat at the bar. I was there before she got there, so I ordered beer. Our bartender, Nate was very knowledgeable, and courteous. When she arrived, we ordered our food and waited for a short time before our appetizer arrived. She always orders the same thing, while I want to experiment and try new food.  One thing we both didn't like was how much dressing was on our salad. It was swimming in it, and made the entire dish of salad very salty (we had Caesar salad-with NO KALE! Ew).

The chicken crusted Parmesan is usually wonderful but the last couple of times it tasted awful, almost like it was being cooked in a pan with a bunch of other meat flavors and grease cooking in it.  BJ's your food quality has really gone down hill, get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=40

It was a sad excuse of an entree to be served.  My son had a kids meal with spaghetti that sat under a heart lamp to long and had dried out the noodles not covered in sauce.  My wife ordered a burger that was very good,  huge patty nice bun and had really good fries.  My recommendation is to order a hamburger and stay away from their Italian menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=40

Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4475,2216,19024,3.0,8/28/2012,"Westminster BJ's is similar to most BJ's except its slower, duller, and more forgettable. Three of us came for a late night dinner, but too early for the 10:00-11:00 late night BJ's happy hour. There were about 5 other tables of glassy-eyed customers quietly eating & drinking. This may have been the quietest BJ's experience of my life. I got my usual Jeremiah Red while the others tried wine. For dinner, I opted for the Tuscan Chicken Limone with Angel Hair Pasta covered with Steamed Baby Spinach and a Lemon-Butter Sauce with sauteed Garlic, Artichoke Hearts, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. The pasta was slightly overcooked and the sauce a little thick, but it was filling and a-ok.  Pat S. got a Portobello Mushroom & Fontina Cheese Deep-dish Pizza while Olivia Z. tackled a Grilled Steak Salad with Skirt Steak, oven-roasted Potatoes, Baby Greens, Bleu Cheese, Yellow Squash, Red Onion, Zucchini, Red Peppers, and Hard-boiled Egg. Luckily, they got full quickly and shared their dishes. Both were fine, but not really special. Service was genuine. It was a slow night for the restaurant and a slow night to be working at BJ's, so, I can fully understand the lack of enthusiasm. Parking is free and easy in the shared lot. When you want BJ's and are near Westminster then this is the place to go. The meal may not be the happy ending you're looking for, but at least you'll leave contented for a little while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=40

Allie, our delightful server, approached us with her charming smile, alluring wit and a hysterical case of the ""clumsy thumbs."" The condensed menu made it quick to order. We split the tasty chicken lettuce wraps, which came with a nice side of sesame soy sauce and the sting of hot Chinese mustard, not the water-down version. These wraps were perfect to share. For our entrée, we split the Moroccan Spiced Salmon and the Mozzarella and Tomato salad...oh the sweet taste of peppery basil still lingers. The Salmon was drenched in spices galore, I think I read nine (two shy of The Colonel, but you have to sacrifice to abbreviate the menu). Sifting our way through the freshly oven baked salmon, seemed like a treasure hunt full of flavors, we found pickled cucumbers, carrots, broccoli and pieces of toasted almonds scattered on top of a veggie couscous.

It didn't take long for someone to come over, but when she did, it was clear this wasn't going to be a good experience. Every question we asked she basically rolled her eyes and sighed before attempting to answer it, most of which she couldn't. She seemed a bit socially awkward, and not talkative (excellent qualities for her profession) and on top of it all she disappeared toward the end after we specifically told her we were in a rush for a movie.  The person who delivered our food seemed to have a similar attitude problem, but at the end with our waitress nowhere to be found,  we flagged down a manager to get us our bill and he was pleasant at least.

It wasn't until a good while later that she started crying rather loud that the server brought the food out which seemed to have been ready. One drink refill the entire time and we asked for ranch on the side. It came on the pizza. We didn't have time to wait for another pizza to be made. The food is good and predictable.

Note: we werent even loud, the same if not less from the loudness of the place itself. Although i must say the red velvet beer is pretty good.  Now to the rating of the recent visit. The only reason why I wanted to come back was to try the stuff mushrooms. When we got there, we were seated up in a booth in  the bar area which i thought was strange seeing how there were so many open tables on the floor.  Any ways the server was nice but the menu was overwhelming.  I ordered their ribeye medium (came out  more medium rare which i didnt mind). The crusted season on it was a bit salty but good. The asparagus and green beens that accompanied it was ok, The green beans had a little salt and butter to them but the asparagus were plain.

Ed P.,"Cincinnati, OH",143,461,206,3.0,6/15/2011,"Last night I met up with one of my college roommates, Nick, at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  Though we haven't really stayed in touch, I still see him from time to time, though it had probably been a couple of years.  He has been doing some work related training in Boulder all week, so we decided to meet up for some drinks in Broomfield, which is between Denver and Boulder.  I remembered eating at the BJ's in Boulder a few years back, and suggested we meet there. Kim and I arrived to find Nick in the waiting area with a beer already in hand.  We grabbed a table for the three of us and started catching up.  Nick and Jessica have a son that is almost six months old, so we had lots to talk about, especially with our upcoming adventure into parenting.  I started with a Pumpkin Ale, my first of the season.  It was a little sweet for my liking at first, but the spicy pumpkin pie like finish brought me back for more.  It obviously wasn't my favorite beer ever, but it was an alright start to the night. For dinner, we decided to split two medium pizzas.  We ordered the vegetarian and the southwestern, with chipotle tomato sauce, spicy blackened chicken, green chilies, cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes topped with fresh cilantro.  The vegetarian tasted very much as I expected, but the southwestern was delicious!  The thick deep dish pizzas reminded me a little of Pizza Hut pizza, but much better quality.  I think it was the bubbly crust with a hint of grease that reminded me of the Hut.  However, the tomatoes were giant slices, and all of the fresh toppings were piled high. To round out the night I sampled both the Piranha Pale Ale and the Tatonka Stout.  I had the Piranha before and remembered it being a very solid pale ale with a great hop character.  The stout was the real surprise of the night, actually an imperial stout, with a nice spiciness at first, followed by a mellow balance of malt and hop that you'd expect from a stout.  It had much more flavor than I was expecting, and I would definitely order it again.  I enjoyed these beers over continuing conversation with my old friend.  We both agreed that we needed to get together more often.  To make it easier to stay in touch, I tried to convince him to join Facebook, but he has no interest.  Oh well, I'd rather meet for beers anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=100

We were seated right away on a busy Friday night, and had ordered our food and drinks a few minutes later. The menu has many options and I believe there's something for everyone there. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken with the mashed potatoes and broccoli. Absolutely delicious. The chicken was crispy yet so juicy inside. And the lemony cream sauce on top is just fantastic. My husband had the rib eye also with potatoes/broccoli. He said the steak was well seasoned and easy to chew (not tough like other places) and cooked just how he asked. Needless to say he finished the entire plate. My toddler had a kids meal which he picked at and ate a little here and there, which is the usual because he's a picky toddler all of a sudden. But he did tell me the fries were very yummy. The chocolate chunk pizookie was spectacular! Fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top, simplicity makes this one so good. The only thing I would skip are the fruity cocktails. I ordered the watermelon basil margarita and I expected some fresh watermelon in there. It does say puree, but I'm pretty sure it was some type of syrup. It didn't taste like real watermelon and it gave the drink a syrup like consistency. The signature margarita is much better. The reason for the 5 starts instead of 4 was our server Tyler. He was the best! Informative, nice, always checked on us. That is the kind of server all restaurants need.

Every plate came out cold on the outside and dried like it sat under a heat lamp for 15+ mins before being served, and everything, beer included, was flat. When asked about the lack of carbonation, our server was kind enough to tell us, ""Well if it's pouring like that now, it's going to be pouring like that all night, and there's nothing that I can do about it."" When asked if the dates available for certain soups was a ""hard schedule"" or not, his response was,""Even if I wanted to get you that, we don't even have it in the building right now.""

Ken K.,"Denver, CO",35,335,11,3.0,5/31/2011,"In the company of Bonefish Grill and Colorado Hacienda, BJ's is par for the stripmall course: a chain pizza restaurant that has ""Santa Fe spring rolls"" on the menu -- which aren't bad if you've never been to Santa Fe or had a real spring roll. On the same night as the Santa Fe whatever-the-fuck rolls, I also tried a BBQ pulled sandwich, which consisted of a huge helping of slow-cooked pork, deep fried onion matter, and high fructose corn syrup that had been erroneously labeled on the menu as ""BBQ sauce."" (Maybe it's supposed to be Kansas City style. And maybe BJ's Corporate things Kansas City puts absolutely nothing but sugar in its BBQ sauce. Maybe that.) But it's not all bad. From past experience both at this location and in Boulder, I can say with confidence that if you stick to what BJ's knows and does well, you'll go home happy. Try a calzone with artichoke hearts and feta, or a pizza -- deep dish if you like pizza that's easily confused with casserole. And do try the P.M. Porter.

And, they are a brewery that carries beers other than those they brew. So, craft brew junkies and coors light diehards now have a place where they can co-exist! Be aware, this is the kind of place that only does Happy Hour specials/pricing in the actual bar area. We were able to work out a deal with our server and the manager so that we got our first round & appetizers for the happy hour price, but I think that is much more the exception than the rule. HH is $1 off BJ's beers, $2 off appetizers and half price mini-pizzas. I snagged the Ahi Tuna Poke, the Pumpkin Beer & the Nutty Brewnette. All three were fabulous! The Poke was served with avocados and pita chips, which was weird, but good. The Pumpkin Beer is the best I've had this season, nice flavor and not flat like so many pumpkin beers can be. And, the Nutty Brewnette is one of my personal favorites (not just because I am one). The kitchen was slow, so it felt like it took quite a while to get our food. But, the restaurant was pretty packed. And, it was pretty fantastic that our server was willing to do separate checks for everyone at our table of 12, but that of course takes time as well, so we felt like we were sitting around for some time after we had all finished.

When I brought this oversight to our waitress, she was apologetic and said she'd be right back with bacon and cheese. I didn't think, for one second, that she would actually come back with cheese and bacon on a plate. I figured she had misspoken and would be back with a fresh, correct, bacon cheeseburger. Nope. She actually expected me to put cold cheese and bacon on some crumbled ground beef. When I told her I wanted a new burger, she took mine away and brought a new one out 10 minutes later.

Hate that feeling and to spend money on a bad experience too. It started off bad when my family of 4 was seated in a booth and they knew I have an 8 month old but they told us to put her with the car seat actually resting on the table. It felt sooooo crammed. Then my 8 month old needed to eat and my 3 year old hit his head on the table...crying kids and the waitress approaches and asks for our drink order...haven't even looked at the menu with making the bottle and settling down my 3 year old after the head bonk....okay now let's look at the menu...My husband ordered the brewhouse blond beer which he did enjoy. We decided on the sweet pig (hawaiian) hand tossed pizza. I also ordered a house salad out first. The salad was just meh. The croutons tasted stale but I did like the sliced cucumber and tomato. The pizza came and I could not believe the size. We ordered the 14' sharable and it was so tiny and thin. I did not know hand tossed meant thin crust. We were soooo disappointed and it was just luke warm like it had been sitting on the counter waiting for someone to take it to our table...and considering it was empty in the restaurant I am not sure why it didn't come right out. It didn't help that both our kiddos missed their naps today as we spent the day in Boulder, so they were fussy during dinner and the whole experience just was not enjoyable....I will not order the hand tossed again. Pizza hut makes better pizza....huge bummer. waste of money.

Uhm, I hope he changes his gloves after every new plate he cooks due to sanitary reasons. Then I had finished my drink and no one had come around to ask me if I wanted a refill.

Stephen K.,"Denver, CO",105,590,836,4.0,6/2/2009,"I'm honestly not certain why this particular BJ's is averaging 2 1/2 stars, when the ones in Aurora and Boulder are getting 3 1/2 stars.  I'm reading the reviews for this place and they don't seem to be slapping BJ's across the face for lousy service, it more than anything else seems to be ""gee you aren't blowing our socks off with amazing, unusual food -- and you aren't focusing on 1 cuisine, you're trying to be many things to many people -- therefore we're going to spit down on you.""  * WTF*, is what I say.  I just don't understand that mentality.  So they have pizzas and salads and sandwiches and pasta and burgers.  Does that mean a place warrants lousy ratings?  If so, should every restaurant chain with multiple cuisines suffer the same fates?  Not in this reviewer's opinion...*shrug* I took my friend here the night of my big move, which ended up being quiet and rainy - not terribly crowded especially at 8 at night, which was nice -- but still showing some signs of life.  I ordered the Jambalaya (blackened chicken, shrimp and Chicken- Andouille sausage, sautéed with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce).  I requested they replace my rice with bowtie pasta and they had no problems at all with me requesting that, nor did they charge me extra for it.   My friend had the Grilled Chicken pasta (rotelle noodles with cream sauce, steamed broccoli and grilled chicken breast).   Perhaps it's true what folks say about ""hunger being the best chef"", but both meals were delectable -- and BIG. O_O  They brought me a bowl the size of a small swimming pool which I managed to finish maybe 60% of and then ate the rest 2 days later.   The Jambalaya was spiced nicely, not too timidly or too boldly -- or perhaps that was the sauce that was mixed in - it also apparently goes really well with bowtie pasta versus the traditional rice.   We both enjoyed tasty garlic bread with our meal and didn't have to wait an inordinately long time for our order.   We also enjoyed a brew each off their tasty beer menu -- I had the Nutty Brewnette which was somewhat nutty and tasty, and my friend had the Jreemiah Red -- a little malty and definitely an interesting flavor, in a good way.   I was more or less ready to get carted out in a wheelbarrow, but my friend ordered dessert and convinced me to wedge a few bites into my body (anyone remember the ""wafer-thin mint"" sequence from Monty Python with Mr Creosote?  Yeah...that's what I felt was going to happen... :) of his Cookies and Cream Pizookie (a large flattened Oreo-type chocolate cookie with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of creamy mousse)...it was yummily decadent but I seriously waddled out of that place and just barely under my own power -- having also had finished packing and moved 10 hrs that day, my legs were already beat; then the huge meal on top of that. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive, and was just the right amount of small-talky with each of us when we were ordering and then later on.  The check was presented within about 2 minutes of requesting it.  Really, nothing at all to complain about, it was quite enjoyable and I'd definitely go again -- the brewery part makes it all the sweeter to check out.  Whoever thinks this place equals Chilis needs to get out more often - the food items are definitely more upscale tastewise and choicewise than that.  I would ponder putting it within 1/2 a star of CB&Potts though or whatever the other place I am thinking of is, and maybe 1/2 star below the Wynkoop's menu - where the rest of their beers lie remains to be determined at a future date...:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=180

Col.

Okay, let's get a handle on things here, before my arch-urbanite-in-the-'burbs act carries us away: BJ's is a chain restaurant and it's in Westminster, so we pretty much know what to expect there. The place is big. The families are big. The food is big, and it has neither the craftsmanship and flavor of true cuisine nor the sense of place that manifests in the flavors of a family-run kitchen. The menu is big -- pastas, steaks, sandwiches, pizza and a full run of house-brewed beer that I don't care about, because on the rare occasion I eschew hard liquor and pick up a beer, it's going to be the Guinness -- and, by and large, pretty well executed. They do major volume here at dinner, and never once have I been served something that wasn't well presented and prepared. The deep dish pizzas are like a tastier version of Pizza Hut, the sandwiches and fries have been tasty, and my servers have always been fast and friendly.

S G.,"Seattle, WA",0,57,4,1.0,4/23/2012,"Went here for lunch and things got started off on the wrong foot. Several staff walked right by us with out asking if we had been helped when we were obviously waiting for a table, we were not the only ones waiting and the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess couldn't be bothered to even look up at us from her register to help us and eventually a waiter from a different section got us a table. We ordered some beers and when I went to take a sip out of mine the bottom of the glass separated from the glass and beer dumped all over our table and all over my lap. We started to corral the beer to keep it from running off the table. I asked a passing waiter for some towels and noted the spill, a little bit later our waiter came to the table and exclaimed that this glass breakage is a common occurrence, he failed to help us in any way and by the time the other waiter returned to the table with the towels, we had already cleaned up all the liquid and just used the towels to try and keep everything from getting sticky. I could be wrong but I don't recall anyone apologizing for the broken glass, my beer soaked pants or anything else. They failed to bring us new napkins, did not comp the beer or make any effort to make amends for the situation. They failed to clear the beer soaked napkins and towels until we insisted that they take them off of our table, this was after our waiter and another waiter had been at our table no less then 3-4 separate times to bring us new drinks, food, etc. In addition to that mess, they did not bring us straws which we asked for 3 times and our water glasses sat empty a few times for quite a while.  The food was OK, not fantastic, just OK. The beer was not very good and definitely not worth all the headache. The service here is beyond horrible, their service manager should lose their job for the obvious lack of training that they have done.

And as we left a little bit later, we were followed by the eyes of everyone from our server to the hostess.  Holy crap.  Take responsibility.  It was a mistake, a gross mistake, but we're all human.  Instead of putting the blame on everyone else, take responsibility, apologize, and chances are we wont even need a manager.  We won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westminster?start=180
