35,Josephine S.,"Norman, OK",135,90,139.0,3.0,2012-04-18,"Everyone has decided they want to go out to eat but no one can decide on what they want, so where do you go? Sometimes you strike a compromise, but sometimes BJ's is your best bet. The food can be a bit pricey, but the service is impeccable and they will make up for it tenfold if it isn't. The beer is always delicious. I love to do the seasonals, but the blonde and brunette are yummy, but then again, so are the rest of the brews. The flights are also a lot of fun to get so you can try them all for yourself and decide what you would like to have a full pint of. My favorite thing to eat there is their fish and chips, but their pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and salads are great too! For dessert they have all kinds of Pazookies (giant cookies topped with ice cream), like peanut butter, chocolate chip and at one point Oreo, that are great for sharing, but could be polished off alone. I won't judge you if you aren't into sharing desserts. Whether you are in a booth, at the bar or a table, the ambience is lively but not overly so and there is ample seating for a large group or a little spot a romantic duo can tuck away. Parking can be an issue around dinnertime on the weekends, as well as some weeknights so make sure you get there a little early and maybe even call ahead. Watch out for those big nights in Norman when parents are in visiting their kids or seeing them graduate - BJ's is a favorite and will be packed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman?start=40,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001

There was a 25 minute wait when we arrived at around 8ish, but we only waited 10 minutes. I have to say the Norman location compared to the Memorial location seems more packed with more parents eating out with their babies or toddlers. It is very loud and I prefer the Memorial location due to the older crowd, but our food and service was excellent. My bf had the stuffed mushrooms and jambalaya and I had the gluten free pizza. Both of our entrees were delicious and cooked perfectly. He also had their popular beers, and I had a couple glasses of wine. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and will be coming back!

Service was the main downfall for our party.  I went 10-15 minutes at times with an empty glass.  At one point, I asked the server to just bring two glasses of tea with her as she kept apologizing for being so slow.  The sad part is that the restaurant was not busy and she only appeared to have a few tables.

22,Shawn G.,"Norman, OK",1,32,,4.0,2014-06-22,"I go to BJ's every so often and consider it ""in the rotation"" because the food and the service are almost always good. There's always a long wait on the weekends compared to other places because of this, but that can be avoided by using their curbside take away if you need food now. The dining experience is nice and is worth a wait if you find yourself here.  BJ's is a microbrewery and serves its own house brand of beers; they are quite good and you'll probably find one in the style you're looking for, but if you're not sure what you're looking at order their flight of beers and get a small sample of each one.  This is a great place to go and just hang out with friends or family because they have a huge assortment of appetizers, which I always find to match up well with any evening of extended drinking and chatting. Several years ago their Southwest Eggrolls pretty much set the bar for nouveau American appetizer food and were quickly copied by just about everyone.  Like several other posters have mentioned their pizzas are excellent. I usually build my own and am always really happy with it. I also recommend their chicken fried steak meal, it's also really good. If you're looking for something on the lighter side I have also enjoyed and recommend their balsamic chicken dish. For desert you really should try the pizookie - I don't really care for chocolate chip cookies myself but wow is theirs fantastic.

Not bad at all considering the volume and we easily got a drink from the bar while we waited.  The restaurant was very large, clean, and had a variety of seating options. Our server did a great job! Our group of 4 was pretty vocal and he played right along with us joking and got everything on our order correct. The host who sat us was also very friendly and made us feel very comfortable, apologizing for the wait. All the staff we came in contact with from the bartender to the food runners were well put together, spoke clearly, and interacted with our table very well. As a customer service manager in the restaurant industry I take notice of this very quickly! We had 3 appetizers:  Thai Shrimp Lettuce wraps - mediocre, not a lot of flavor and the lettuce was way too large for the filling.  Ahi Poke - basically a rare ahi tuna tartare served with a nutty soy dipping sauce was very very good! It didn't last long and we thought about ordering another. Full of flavor and served at the perfect cool temperature.  Calamari - breading was tasty, didn't wow me but calamari is pretty standard to prepare. Served with 2 dipping sauces a spicy ranch and a barbecue something. Good portion for 4! We were all very pleased with our entrees, after spending awhile going through their extensive options. They literally have just about everything, pizzas, pasta, steak, burgers, soups, salads, chicken, and seafood.  We had: Lemon Chicken Pasta - angel hair pasta, with a creamy lemon, butter sauce served with 2 chicken breasts, steamed spinach, and artichoke hearts. Very good portion of food and full of flavor, not too heavy for a pasta dish.  Deep Dish Baked Lasagna - made with ricotta cheese, it was baked perfectly and full of fillings.  NY Strip - cooked to order, med-rare with 2 sides of choice: horseradish mashed potatoes and asparagus  Ribeye - cooked to order, med-rare with the mash and broccoli  Overall, I recommend BJ's for all demographics from families to solo travelers.

BJ's is an exception except for one item.  I expect a Brewhouse that has a window looking at beer storage tanks to actually brew their product on site.  Not the case at BJ's as the brewing tanks are for show only. That said, their Blonde beer which is brewed in Houston by St. Arnold Beer (a tiny company with many different clever brews) is just plain super.  It was served cold and crisp and tastes great. Coming from St. Louis where Lasagna is a religion, BJ's did not meet that standard but was good.  My salad with blu cheese dressing not so much.  You should be able to recognize the taste of blu cheese and perhaps see a chunk or two of the tasty treat.

49,Rosa L.,"Carrollton, TX",0,23,,2.0,2015-08-10,"Want some over- priced nuked food? You'll get it here. We ordered a Caesar salad but they were out of Caesar salad dressing, That should have been a tip that the food here was not freshly prepared. We settled for the wedge instead. Ugh. Not sure what the basic dressing was on this salad but it was thin, kind of slimy sweet/tart white stuff with a couple bleu cheese sprinkles on it. The wedge was a very small piece of iceberg lettuce with some chopped tomato and hard, not crisp, bacon crumbled on it. Not good. Our shared entrée was a deep dish pizza. Sort of. Basically it was lukewarm dough served in a deep dish pizza pan. It was topped with meatballs which also tasted like dough so I'm thinking they must have a lot of bread in them, stringy mozzarella cheese, chunks of tomato that tasted like they were freshly plucked from a can and a smattering of tough hot white onions. We were starved so we ate the mess, waited and waited for refills on our drinks and got out of there fast.  Service was lackluster from our front desk greeter seater who was in love with his cell phone to the manager who brought out our lukewarm pizza. The server introduce herself or show up much after bringing our drinks. This place is just a definite ""just keep looking for something better"" kind of place.

53,J Jason B.,"Atlanta, GA",121,89,12.0,4.0,2015-08-20,"BJ's is one of those places that I think about going to often but only get there about twice a year.  Maybe because I always prefer to not eat at a chain when I do go out, but as far as corporate places go in Nompton, BJ's is probably my fave.  And by the way, I feel stupid reviewing corporate places.  There's over 100 BJ's in this great nation and chances are you've been to one.  So if you haven't been to one, say you're new to America, or you've only just become old enough to eat out, or maybe you're 16 and you just got a license and before this your parents never took you out to eat.  Maybe you lived waaaaaay out in the country,,, anyway, if any of these conditions apply or you'd like to know more about this particular BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, by all means keep reading. I guess I'd describe BJ's as if Cheesecake Factory and Spaghetti Warehouse had a baby, which by the way- gross.  Cheesecake and spaghetti should never be imagined together like that.  BJ's lacks the baroque grandeur of Cheesecake Factory, but the plush seating and attentive, pleasant, well trained service put BJ's in a different league than Spaghetti Warehouse.  The menu is American cuisine, which is to say, pretty much Italian cuisine with a good number of dishes that aren't Italian.  Pizza, pasta, steak, chicken, potatoes, burgers... cookies.  Anyone can find something they like here (even vegetablists like myself.)  If not, ditch em.  Seriously.  Even my dad, who thinks that 5 cheese blend on a pizza is just a way of skimping on mozzarella, can find something he likes, (which was, not surprisingly, an all mozzarella pizza with sausage.) As far as decor, all the BJ's I've been to are nice, but I really like this one in Norman. The building was a Don Pablos for years and even though its essentially the same building, its nearly impossible to tell, what once was once a loud faux barrio is now cavernous, upscale, and fresh. BJ's is not cheap, its not expensive.  I'd say you get what you pay for, so if you're down for something nice I think BJ's is always worth the money.  That, I guess, is probably what keeps me from going there more often, that or the location.  Which reminds me, if you are new to Norman or are in the area on a business trip (unlikely) or perhaps are in town for one of our many (sarcastic) festivals, here's a good way to get to BJ's:  by helicopter.  BJ's sits on the finest lot in the most poorly planned business park ever.  Lets put all these businesses on a divided winding frontage road with no highway access and let's put an entrance at the apex of each blind corner.  Great going, city. BJ's also brews their own beer and has a full bar, its a great place to watch a game.  There's a good view of at least one television from (probably) every seat. Their signature dessert, the pizookie, is never as good in real life as it is in my head.  That said, I want one now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.152,3.2000000000000006

I received an email from them asking how my experience was when I ate there last, and let me tell you - I absolutely reamed them. Seriously, it was a rrreaaalllyyy long email.  Visit #1 - Went with friend and ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. Omg people. I never spit food out. Ever. It's impolite, and isn't very attractive.  That being said, I took one bite of the chicken lettuce wrap and immediately (and unflatteringly) instinctively spit the food back out and began choking.  You want to talk about unnecessarily spicy? Yeah. That was it. I literally. *Literally* couldn't even eat the chicken part of the wrap because it was so flaming hot spicy.  I ended up just putting the dish to the side for the waitress to take.  The manager came over and apologized for the experience and offered to get me another item from the menu (I just opted to share a pizza with my friend) and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer.  Visit #2 & 3 - Went with boyfriend for a healthy dinner and ordered the sirloin steak with asparagus and a cup of clam chowder.  The clam chowder was ""meh,"" and came out cold. Not room temperature. Cold. As if someone had taken the soup out of the fridge and just dumped it in the bowl. Ew. We also didn't get any oyster crackers with them. :(  Now, I'm of the personal opinion that a steak and asparagus isn't exactly something that would be easy to screw up. *Buzzer* Wrong. The steak and asparagus were completely inedible. The spicyness and heat from the seasoning on the sirloin blew up my mouth and definitely irrigated my sinuses....sniffling, tears and all. The asparagus wasn't any better. They appeared to have thrown the asparagus onto a grill and then taken an entire bottle of ground pepper and poured it on top of the vegetable.  Needless to say, not only was it spicy as all heck, but the asparagus wasn't even cooked! It was still almost completely raw. At this point, I was too frustrated to call a manager. I didn't want to appear like one of *those* people who comes in and complains just to get free food, and my very long email to them went unanswered, so what's the point?  Not going back to this BJ's again. Maybe someday I'll work up the cajones and visit another location, but my lips can still feel the burn from that steak.

Only reason this gets 3 stars is for the Jeremiah Red and the good pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

Drinks at the bar are good and service is pretty quick. However,  their curbside pick up and just regular pick up orders is lacking. Went to pick up on a Friday and all the spots for curbside were full.  Parked at bfe went in to get curbside order and waited around for a good 10 mins. I had servers walk past me and not even ask if I needed help. Same thing goes when I order pick up. I pick a specific time to pick up, I'm there to pick up at specific time. Apparently, your Togo order people didn't get the message because again I wait about 10 minutes to even get noticed.  Just aggravating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

Great lighting and atmosphere for something intimate. I loved the setting. Great spot n their menu I didn't give it a 5 because their drinks could be a little stronger my mojito tasted like water basically.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
