She was young but understood that her job was not complicated-serving food and drinks. I also asked that she NOT DO two things: ask me how my food, salad, etc. was and ask me if I wanted more coffee. ""Just keep it full please."" The food delivery was perfect-salad first and the entree just as I finished the salad. Salad was cool, not ice cold and entree was perfect temperature. Portions were just right. I really liked that especially since I hate to throw food away. I highly recommend this place for great service, great food, sufficient portions and a great kitchen.

I'm not a pictures-on-the-menu sort of person. And though I'm not a vegetarian, I simply didn't want any meat at this meal and the only meatless item they have is the grilled cheese sandwich. They don't even have a vegetarian salad! I know it's Applebee's, but I figured they'd at least have a black bean burger. My ladyfriend had something called Chicken Wonton Tacos. What? Gimmickry. All told, and despite my too-cool-for-school shame at even being there, we got some lunch, it was exactly as advertised and there wasn't anything wrong with it. So credit where credit is due.

4,A L S.,"Biloxi, MS",6,130,110.0,4.0,2013-11-11,"This Applebee's is a good choice if you like this genre of food.  The location and parking are easy access from I-75.  It is clean and well staffed.  A sure sign of good management is that on this Veterans Day Comp Meal service, the host ASKED if we would mind sharing a table--not a requirement.  This sped up service for everyone and made it easier on the staff. The door had been held open for us to enter and leave on this cool weather day. We had the Fiesta Lime Chicken which is a sautéed breast with a southwestern sauce top and covered in cheddar jack cheese.   It was served with southwestern rice which was tasty and cooked just right with kernels separating and not mushy or sticky.  Accompanying was a lime wedge, pico de gallo and tiny colored tortilla strips.  All in all a good choice as we have eaten this several times before across the US; it has always been consistent from one to another of the chain.  Our server Sharonda was very pleasant and professional.  We shared a table with a couple that was rather demanding.  The servers' attitude was great and accommodating and did not suffer any ill when one of the ladies wanted another vegetable choice after the food arrived (she actually received two more fresh sides because she told the runner and the server she didn't like the first menu item given--she was charged for neither).  The 20 something irregular customer also did not like her food touching anything on the plate and thought the free steak was too small, but her friend got her to ""get over it"".  The steak customer did not complain about the way it was cooked, so it seemed to have been satisfied as she ended up taking the leftovers home and even ordered dessert. The other customer (non-comp) had baby back ribs and the plate was cleaned.  Sharonda keep up with fantastic service in the busy dining hour and met and exceeded everyone's demands.  She was a true professional that I would have love to have in my own Café.  The iced tea was good but my wife said the coffee was not fresh--the only complaint, typical but not acceptable in the mid afternoon hour.  Always ask for fresh--most servers will start a new pot.  Applebee's supports many charities ( ) as noted by a No Kid Hungry sticker on the door ( ).  All in all a good food and service choice made better when we researched the charitable giving.  We will go again to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-stockbridge-3?start=40,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000003,1.8400000000000005

37,Keith F.,"Atlanta, GA",38,100,32.0,1.0,2016-12-19,Used to be one of my favorite restaurants when I was traveling. But this was very disappointing. Wings were 1 out of a ten point scale. There were definitely cooked previously then warmed up.

36,Anthony J.,"Decatur, GA",8,46,16.0,1.0,2017-01-31,"This has to be one of the worst Applebee's in the area and judging by the reviews others think so as well. Let me begin my critique with the piss poor service. I attempted to call my order ahead of time to be proactive, but was on hold the duration of my drive to the restaurant, so needless to say no one picked up for at least 12 minutes. I ordered two salads to go, from the bar. While I was waiting a gentleman came behind me and ordered a burger and fries. Thinking my order should come out first and the simplicity of my order, the guy who ordered the burger got his food first and I had to wait for another 10 minutes for salad!!! Are you kidding...  When I got home ready to eat my salad, I looked in the bag, No salad dressing and No eating utensils.... Come on man...!! What did they expect me to do... throw my face into my salad bowl and choke down a dry salad... I'm never coming back to this place and I strongly advise any of you reading this review not to patronize this location until they have made some serious amendments to service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-stockbridge-3,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

30,Michael B.,"Atlanta, GA",16,39,77.0,2.0,2017-07-23,It's amazing how the prices go  up and the quality goes down. Waitress was not the best either. What's funny is that no one from headquarters will read this. Oh yeah the food score was an 88. More like a fast food joint than a restaurant now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-stockbridge-3,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
26,Marquis S.,"Stockbridge, GA",74,23,25.0,2.0,2017-08-24,"This was a so so experience. As far as the ambiance goes, well, it's Applebees.  That being said, it seemed uncharacteristically mundane.  The staff didn't seem all that enthused to be working.   They weren't mean or rude; they just lacked that positive attitude that servers normally possess. The food was blah.  I had the shrimp and bourbon chicken.  Potatoes were the included side item.  The potatoes were over cooked. The chicken was a little tough and the onions weren't properly caramelized.  The presentation was sloppy and our beverages were never refilled.  All in all, it was a tolerable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-stockbridge-3,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

27,Paige B.,"Conley, GA",50,2,,1.0,2017-11-25,This is one of the worst Applebee's I have ever visited.  1. The waitresses and management staff were unprofessional looking and acting 2. Our drinks were falsely advertised and in the wrong glassware and took forever to reach our table. 3. When confronted about the drink problem we were given 3 different stories as to why they were using the smaller glassware that was actually plastic and ALL were LIES!! 4. We NEVER received our appetizers or drink refills and the restaurant was not even half full of customers. 5. The manager didn't wanna come to our table to correct the problem right way when we saw our waitress tell him we asked for him. I will NOT be visiting this Applebee's anytime soon if ever again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-stockbridge-3,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003

Not feeling well, so grabbed my order and left. I should have checked it. Ordered a burger added cheese. Got exactly that! There was no lettuce, tomato, pickles, condiments, etc. only option on app was select ""no"" to any of those, but I didn't do that. I'm too far to bother going back.
