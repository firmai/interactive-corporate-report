Leslie W.,"Temple City, CA",26,34,29,3.0,12/19/2017,"This is your standard Chili's chain. If you know what to ordee, this is a great place to have a casual dinner. I've got many fond memories of Chili's - drove my girlfriend to a rooftop restaurant on our first Valentines in 2 hour traffic only to find out it has a fixed $200 seafood menu, which she hates. Where did we go instead? F*** it, let's just go to Chili's. Best Valentine's dinner ever.  There's only one thing you have to try here - Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers. Delicious sticky sauce, quality french fries with ranch and buttery soft corn on the cob. Screw the rest of the menu. 1500 calories of goodness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2
Melissa G.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",7,59,9,1.0,12/20/2017,"First warning avoid the chicken I got salmonella  poisoning. It is one of the worst pains I have ever felt. Called to speak to a manger the next day manager actually tried to tell me it was my fault for not returning the food.  Sorry, however it's your staffs fault. Chicken is one of the top foods you do NOT mess up.  Lunch time at this chili's seems fine. The low crowds probably help them cook everything. Most of the problems seem to happen during dinner service. Drinks are not prepared properly. Food is obviously not.  My advice go to another chili's. Or another restaurant in Monrovia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2
Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,11/3/2017,"I am a creature of habit so my default order every time I come to Chili's seems to be chips and salsa and the 3-item Ultimate smokehouse combo set.  I love how thin and crispy their chips are, as I'm not a fan of those heavy thick deep fried chips that some other places serve. I usually go for the salsa accompaniment, but sometimes, if there's a Chili's deal going on, the queso is pretty good too. The smokehouse combo comes with roasted street corn, fries, garlic toast & pickles. For the meat, you can choose from chicken crispers, smoked sausage, BBQ chicken breast, or ribs. I've tried them all and enjoy the ribs and chicken crispers the best. I usually find chicken breast dry so I normally prefer to have dark meat over white. The smoked sausage is delicious, especially the first bite, but eating the whole thing gets overwhelming (too much flavor and too heavy at the end), which makes it drop down the list after ribs and crispers. 90% of the time, I only get as far as ordering the chips and salsa and the smokehouse set and then call it quits with leftovers to take home. The other 10%, I'll still order the same and have leftovers, but add in a dessert of the molten lava cake. Oooh, don't forget to sign up for their Rewards Program (coordinated with Plenti), which allows you to rack up points and offers various discounts and offers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2
Teresa I.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",221,251,579,4.0,1/6/2018,"Great service, good food,  and great ambiance. This is for the bar side.  Shout out to Raquel, our bartender, she makes some pretty AWESOME margaritas. She was pretty vigil about asking if we needed anything or if we were good.  The food came out quick. I love, love their enchilada soup and their chips are really good too. What's great about the bar area is that she actually put 4 different football games on.  Most places you walk in and there's only one or two games in several tvs. Plenty of parking and you can order to go.  The restaurant is clean and so were the bathrooms.  Hope to come back for dinner.  Although,  I really like the bar area.  Great spot to hang out with friends on Sunday to watch the games.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2
Armand S.,"Monrovia, CA",252,117,333,3.0,10/17/2017,"Love Chili's, not sure why the low reviews. It's chili's, I guess you should know what you're getting into unless the service totally stinks. The thing I always get here are the Chicken Crispers.  The heart attack on a platter as one waitress said to me many years ago.  I never really order anything else as my main entree as this is my favorite item on the whole menu.  Sure, I've tried the fajitas, burgers and even the ribs. I mean, who can forget their infamous song.. ""I want my baby back, baby back, baby back..."" Still after all that, it's all about the original chicken crispers. The other main reason why I come here is because they have one of my all time favorite desserts, the fricken chocolate molten cake. Omg this thing is to die for. Perfectly cooked chocolate cake with warm hot fudge oozing in the middle. Crowned with vanilla ice cream and chocolate fudge over that.  .tasty. Food came out tally fast, but he service was a little lackluster. Once the food came, we didn't see our waitress for awhile, a good 15-20 minutes after. We had to flag down some rando to ask for more napkins, water refill, etc. Forgot to take pictures as we were busy watching Justine Turner hit a walk off to beat the Cubs in game 2 of the NLCS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2

Great job I liked the updated menu and kids menu too (good new and some healthy options for the kiddos).  Extra $2 charge for dry rub? Ok Beware, there is a $1.99 ""table entertainment"" fee that I was unaware of for some games that my kid was playing on the table kiosk thing.

Cammie N.,"Arcadia, CA",227,59,27,2.0,9/18/2017,"Ever since Applebee's closed down in this area, my family didn't really have a go-to sit-in chain restaurants type of thing that still had fairly cheap food. So, we decided to opt for Chili's and this was probably one of the worst decisions ever.  At our first visit, the place was pretty packed, so we understood why there was slow service and what-not. However, they made up for it by offering us free chips and salsa which was pretty cool. So, our first time visit went fairly well. Thus, we decided to go for our second time and this just wasn't ideal at all.  On this visit, the service was extremely slow as there simply wasn't enough workers. There wasn't a long line and I would assume that there were a few dabbles of people here and there. However, we had to wait a long time to the point where it just became frustrating. We had to wait approximately twenty minutes to order our food. On top of that wait, we had to wait another hour to have our food come out. Honestly, it just wasn't worth it.  Parking-  There is plenty of parking as this is in a huge plaza. However, finding a parking spot close to the restaurant might become a bit iffy as there are a lot of restaurants nearby.  Food-  Honestly, this kind of made up for the wait time. However, it was either too salty or too bland. (we ordered the bbq trio or something like that)  Service-  One of the worst service I've had before. My parents and I had arrived fairly earlier than families of our same size. However, they were seated before us, which my mom wasn't too pleased about.  In general, come here if you're super hungry and somehow the chipotle or the panera nearby don't suit your taste or come here if you would like to waste time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2

Heidi J.,"Azusa, CA",1,62,57,3.0,12/16/2017,"In general I'm a big fan of Chili's. We love the honey Chipotle boneless wings. I've got to hand it to them I really like the shrimp fajitas here. But when we came the other day I ordered it to go.  we ordered quite a few things which were all yummy but I will say the barbecue chicken breast was very undercooked. So much so that it was very difficult to pull apart. I had to throw it out. This is definitely an isolated incident most likely because I don't normally have issues with the food that I get here.

They have totally taken ordering and paying to an impersonal level. You literally order and pay via tablet. In between service from our server wasn't spectacular or attentive.  When paying for our meal, they don't let you use more than one form of payment. We paid with a gift card and wanted to pay the balance and tip with another credit card. If our server didn't ask us how we were doing he would have been shorted on his table and tips.

Cinthia C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",2,27,19,2.0,7/28/2016,"My family and I enjoy eating at Chili's and frequently visit the Diamond Bar location, since it's closest to us.  My boyfriend and I stopped by the Monrovia location since we were in Arcadia and this location is so awful compared to the one we frequent. Dirty plates, messy servings, and different from what we're used to at the DB location. Servers come off as tired, exhausted, and unenthusiastic. Our server was friendly, she checked up on us but the others were mediocre when we asked for help. The panko onions rings were messy and had crumbs all over the plate, like someone just threw it on quickly. Along with that, the portion was a noticeably smaller portion than what we're served at our usual location. The plate had food crumbs on it and the chicken pasta was dry and sauce-less; again, very different from what we get. Strawberry lemonade was watered down to a light pink color while it is usually a darker pink color. Iced tea was very syrup-y and fake. The booth seat was broken and kept wobbling whenever I moved. My family and I are frequent customers and were familiar with how things usually are. I think we'll just stick to the usual location we go to.

Kaylyn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,205,10,1.0,7/8/2017,"We hadn't been to Chili's in several years after having had too many poor experiences.  Figured it had been a while and hopefully they had their act together a bit better now.  Sadly, we ended up with two even worse experiences.   For the first one we decided to place a to go order.  Two of us stood at the to go counter for almost 15 minutes.  The to go counter is right next to the door to the kitchen, so it isn't as if no one knew we were there.  Finally, one of us asked a passing employer if we could please place an order.  ""Just a minute, I'll get someone for you, "" took another 5+ minutes.  He had some trouble taking our order, but when he repeated back to us, at our request, the order was correct.  We were told about 20 minutes,  so we ran over to one of the stores in the same mall.   We came back at 25 minutes and were told to pick up our food at the bar.   We checked in with the bartender and she said our food wasn't ready yet.   We asked her how much longer and she said that she'd go check.   The guy next to us wished us luck,  and said he'd been waiting almost 45 minutes.   Sure enough,  the bartender came back and told us it would be about another 15 minutes.   The guy next to us got his food before we did,  and was furious by the time he left.   A few minutes later we got our food,  but one meal was missing.  Glad we checked before we left!!  The bartender said she would get the order in on a rush.  Rush?  Yeah,  right!  The manager came by 15 minutes later to apologize and explained that the order had never been entered.   We explained to him that the server who took our order read everything back to us correctly.   He had no believable explanation.   We asked how much longer,  as this whole time the rest of our food is sitting here on the bar in front of us.   BTW.... the bartender said that it was okay for the teenager with us to sit at the bar itself!  When those of is who are over 21 told her that that's very much against the law,  she just laughed and told us to relax.   WTH?  Whatever,  it isn't our liquor license on the line.   It was another 15 minutes before we got our missing food.   Again,  yeah,  big rush!  The manager was smart enough not to ask is to pay for this missing item that took over half an hour to get.   Sure enough everything but the missing item was STONE COLD by the time we got home.    A small group of us made the mistake of going back a couple weeks later to eat there at the restaurant.   It took the sever 15 minutes to even get to the table.   When he did he SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH US!!!!  Two of have been servers and we were both appalled at the gaul, ego,  rudeness and unprofessionalism of this guy.   Let's just say that the rest of the visit went along these same lines.   When we were told to pay at the kiosk on the table,  that was the last straw as far as his tip was concerned!  No chance any of us in either of these two groups will be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=20

He said they don't have any burger with mayo. We educated him about the ingredients of 1000 island dressing. It took FOREVER to get our order taken because the server didn't know how to listen not to mention he didn't understand the ingredients on the dishes so therefore was not capable of answering the questions asked. Not to mention he just flat out didn't listen. I asked him to omit the glaze because I don't eat sugar. He then went to the kitchen or I assumed that was what he did. I then see him walk back out after 10 minuets and take another tables order! He then came back and tried to educate me that all glaze has sugar. I said no kidding that's why I told you to omit the glaze and educated him as to what omit means as it was apparent he didn't have a comprehension of the words definition. He never refilled our drinks! It was so cold in there that I had to walk outside to warm up. In summation, I froze my tits off while waiting 40 minutes to even put an order in.

For the appetizer we had the White Spinach Queso. It was a decent portion. Tasted ok. For dinner we had the salmon and baby back ribs from the Make It a Combo special.  Nothing great.  We didn't even use the little game pad for kids at the table, just scrolled through it to see what games they had. We got charged a fee for that.

The Margarita chicken especially, that was my favorite plate until now. The chicken was extremely salty but the messy beans and spoon full of rice was enough to dilute it; it used to be flavorful and colorful. My sister ordered the enchilada soup, also salty and the waitress stated that it was on the salty side. No entre should ever be to salty and their chefs should know better. My husband mentioned his favorite plate used to offer a variety of sides that he didn't get this time around. Ultimately it comes down to the display of all their entrees and the taste and quality of the food as any other restaurant.

A T.,"Los Angeles, CA",277,202,180,2.0,2/20/2016,"Wanted to try someplace we hadn't been in a while.  We started off at another restaurant - but it was over an hour wait.  Sooo, we moved over to Chili's - that had just a half-hour wait. No problem.  It's a weekend night and it's SoCal...you're going to have to wait at some point. Ordered drinks at the bar while waiting for a table...only to find that WHEN your table comes up they have no way of transferring your bar-tab to your table (such a system exists - I've seen it work). This breaks up our party into couples that are now scattered-about, trying to find and follow our hostess and our table while other servers are running all about with trays of food up and down the aisles. Okay, so we're at our table, our server is nice and attentive, we order, we get our food - and the cola is mixed to the point where it's mainly just soda-water & coloring. Nasty.   Burger joints and restaurants make QUITE a bit of mark-up on soda - so when I come across someplace that tweaks the mix even further, it's usually a sign of bad management - or just plain greed (it literally costs just pennies per serving for the establishment for the syrup.  They then recoup that cost by charging $2-2.50 per serving - and don't forget: the ice helps disburse the image of that serving). Unfortunately, one of our steaks - that had been ordered at medium-rare - came out all brown (Brown is NOT M-rare), so we had to send it back.  Took forever to get it replaced.   As another yelper pointed out - the payment system has now been changed so that after seating you, taking your order and serving it - your server (their employee), no longer has to deal with you.  S/he can be dealing with an entirely different group of people.   Meanwhile, I had to get up and find replacement flatwear (for the missing ones taken with the over-cooked steak), and napkins for our party (we had been given none). Later, we weren't even offered dessert - or a dessert menu to consider. (maybe management decided that was getting in the way of table turn-around per-hour - who knows?) You now pay via a wireless tablet with a built-in printer.  Swipe your card, choose what percentage of tip you wish to leave, sign, and your receipt is printed out immediately. No more human-interaction needed.  In essence; ""Thanks, now SHOO - we need this table for other paying customers"".  (yet they didn't pony-up for the system what allows your bar-tab to follow you to your table). Overall, the experience was NOT what helped make Chili's a cool, go-to place it was in it's early days.  AND, the food wasn't really that good in the first place.  Just, bland. Next time, we have decided to skip Chili's when people are visiting. As we commented about the place on our way home, i mentioned that - in MY mind - Chili's has definitely jumped-the-cuisine-shark...and in doing so, has actually ELEVATED Sizzler to a much more respectable restaurant.

With that being said, my experience last night wasn't pleasant as expected. After the hostess seated us, it was at least a 45 min wait until the server asked us what we wanted to drink. From the get go Kyle let us know that he was having a bad night. I understand everyone has a bad day now and then, but that is not how you start your service with ANYONE! Throughout our dining experience that evening our order was wrong, I tried to help him with which plate belong to who and he said, ""I'm the one serving."", didn't bring us straws when he said he would. Luckily we are able to pay our bill with the machine (which we did pay). If that machine wasn't there we would have waited forever. He hardly came to check on us, that we COULD HAVE walked out without paying.

Jonathan K.,"Carpinteria, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/6/2016,"Wow. I wish I read some of these reviews before last night. If you don't want to read my entire review, here's the synopsis: Don't go here. My girlfriend and I ordered online for takeout. When we arrived, we were told to talk to the bartender to get our takeout order. After a good 5-7 minutes of standing at a vacant bar, we had to ask a waiter if he could help us, ya know, get some service. Finally the bartender came out and looked up our order. She said, ""Oh, here it is. Let me prepare that for you."" We both took that to mean that they were starting to make our orders right then and there. Whether or not that was the case, our order was finally ready after another 10 minutes and a bunch of questions to any passing staff about whether or not they were aware we still existed.  After a short drive home, we realized the food was cold. Not even lukewarm. Our theory then shifted from the meal being made when we arrived to the meal having been made long, long before that. It was gross. It made me sign up for a Yelp account just to write this review. I probably wouldn't have taken the time to do this and would've chalked it up as a loss, but the 12 hours since that ""meal"" have consisted of stomach cramping, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. We didn't eat anything besides Chili's and my girlfriend and I ordered the same exact burger meal. You do the math. Thanks Chili's in Monrovia!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=80

If I didn't inspect my food based on previous chili's visits it would have went over my head . I wonder how long these toppings were re packaged and waiting for someone to order take out . Needless to say I was disgusted by the moldy cheese , I did go ahead and eat my sandwich and fries because upon inspection those seemed fine . Unfortunately the fries tasted like cleaning supplies !! The pretzel roll for the sandwich was so hard I had to pull apart and eat my sandwich with a knife and fork , overall ...Very risky meal ! I wonder if this franchise is on its way out ?

L P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,21,6,1.0,10/4/2016,"I want to start of by saying that I actually love Chili's and frequent the West Covina, Diamond Bar, and City of Industry locations on a regular basis. I am quite familiar with the menu, food quality and what to expect in terms of service, I ended up at this Chili's by default because I had intended on visiting the Applebees's right down the street but it has been closed down. So as we drove down Huntington Drive I saw Chili's and was very confident we would get the best  food and great service regardless of all the other food options available.     We walked into the restaurant and were told that it would 15-20 minute wait for a party of 4 at about 3:45 PM on Saturday. Not bad but as we sat I noticed they were not busy and one side of the restaurant was empty.  So when they finally come to take us to our booth we had to walk by 3 large tables that were filthy and from where they sat me I could see that there 2 other smaller dirty tables as well. Gross!! I also had a direct view of the bar area where I could see a group of employees standing around talking. Not a big deal if the tables were all clean but they weren't. The waitress who is Yvette, greets my family pretty quickly and takes our drink order and I ask her to bring us some chips and salsa which is my favorite. She then informed me that there are no chips. I let her know that I am disappointed and surprised that something that is so popular is not available. After our meal orders are placed, I noticed that there are still employees congregating in the corner and I notice this because I realized that we had been waiting a long time for our food. I ordered Texas cheese fries with no green onion and when they finally came out they have a ton of green onion. I didn't want to send them back because I waited so long in the first place so I just picked off the onion. The rest of the food comes out and my soup is tepid at best. Ugh!! Then to make matters worse one of the employees who was consistently standing in the corner brings out chips and salsa to another table!!! Huh?? So we ask Yvette if we could get chips and salsa and point out that the table across from us received some. Yvette states, ""We have chips now? They never tell me anything here."" And she goes to see if she could get us some and she never comes back to update us. Finally we get her attention and she says, ""There are no chips, that table only got some because they were difficult."" What??? I ask her who the manager is and she says Kyle. I walk to the corner where all the employees are standing which is in the bar area and they don't acknowledge me. So I just say, ""Hello!! Are any of you Kyle?"" And Kyle said Hi I am Kyle. So I proceed to tell him about how disappointed I am in the restaurant's lack of cleanliness, the fact that they have employees standing around when things need to be addressed, and that a table that was seated after us received chips when I was told there where none. Kyle only made matters worse because he informed me that there are no chips and he actually made the chips for that table as if he deserved a pat on the back. Not once was I offered an explanation as to why he only made enough chips for one table or an apology. I walked back to my table, had the waitress get us boxes, paid my bill and  walked out. Guess where Kyle was standing when I left? Right, in the corner!! I will NEVER frequent this Chili's again especially after reading all the comments on YELP. It seems as this location has had many issues for a while. I am so disappointed as it appears that the Corporate office is aware and they are choosing to turn a blind eye to the situation. Poor customer service, filthy restaurants and poorly trained staff is a recipe for disaster. This sends a bad message to your clients which makes me consider never stepping foot in any of their restaurants. SMH!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=80

In general, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but this particular location changed our minds.  In fact, we typically visit the Chilis in Monrovia once or twice a week. The food is delicious, the price is right when you order from the 2 for $20, and most of all, the service is always top-notch. In particular, Reina and the other waitress' are super attentive. Reina even remembers us when we're dining and stops by to say hello even when we're not in her section.  It makes us feel like this is one of ""our spots"" when we have a favorite waitress and she always takes a second to say our names and check up on our lives.

Hugh H.,"Arcadia, CA",1830,401,1423,3.0,9/15/2013,"I haven't been here in years! So, it was nice to be back and see the menu changes that they've had since I've been here.  FOOD/DRINKS - 3 Stars: We ordered the $35 meal which included an appetizer (half order depending what it is), two entrees, and one dessert plus two margarita drinks. Texas Cheese Fries: This was pretty good. It was thick cut fries, cheese, bacon, and some ranch. There was a ton of cheese which I loved. I'll say that the half order was good enough for us. Anything more would've been way to heavy. Bacon Cheeseburger: This was a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and onions. This was juicy, but it was a bit bland. I enjoyed it for the fact I was craving a burger, but that was pretty much it. Sadly, I've had better. It also came with a side of fries that I changed to loaded mashed potatoes. I was also excited for this, but it was alright. I kind of picked at it, but that was it. I'm a potato head, but I easily passed this over. Margarita Grilled Chicken: This was good. My friend liked the chicken and everything that came with it. I wish I enjoyed my meal as much as this was enjoyed. Cookie Skillet: This is a Pazookie wannabe. I had high hopes for it since I was actually craving a Pazookie, but this was a let down. I still ate it though, but the cookie wasn't as gooey as I hoped and it was actually sunken-in in the middle of it, which made it look a bit funny. The edge of the cookie was really overcooked so it was really cripsy versus the soft center. It came with some vanilla ice cream, which I took off. Presidente Margarita: I really liked mine because it had mango in it. I was surprised since I'm not a fan of the margarita taste, but this was good. SERVICE - 4 Stars: Our server was very attentive and awesome with taking our order even though we changed our mind at the very beginning. He was also helpful with us deciding what to order and his input was appreciated. ATMOSPHERE - 3 Stars: This place is noisy and busy with a lot of action. Aside from the kid constantly kicking the booth chair shared for two tables, everything was alright. There's also a bar area where people were watching the game so you'd hear shouts every so often. RECOMMENDATION: Well, I've had my Chili's fix for a couple of years or more. I don't think that I'd necessarily have the craving or desire to go back unless I had to for some reason. Don't get me wrong, you'll get some decent food here, but this is not high on my list of places to come back to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=120

Dillon was our server. He was a nice enough kid but not at all on top of things. I asked for an order of chips and salsa to munch on before we received our dinner, he forgot. Then during our meal we asked him to bring us water, he forgot. Then, I used the little kiosk machine at our table to pay the bill. When Dillon came by as we were about to leave, I told him that we paid our bill already. Then, he leaned over the table and gave himself a rating of ""excellent"" on the kiosk machine. I didn't notice after I paid the bill that i would have the option to rate my server. I was very annoyed that he felt he gave us excellent service when in fact his level of service was just mediocre. Also, why the hell did he take upon himself to complete the rating instead of asking me to do it? I reminded him that he forgot our water. Instead of apologizing, he asked if we would like to take our water to go. I declined. Hey Dillon, your service was not excellent dude. I hope the manager is reading this.

The shrimp tacos were good but the rice that came with it wasn't. My egg rolls are good but the cheesesteak and wings were just okay.  The service was alright but I was disappointed in the food.

Having many options to go to dinner on a Sunday night I thought Chili's would be a good choice. Was I wrong. First the waiter thought he was very smart by saying what you were going to say before you finished your sentence which was very annoying. He must of been annoyed him self that we had moved from the bar area to his section. We waited a very long time to get are food 20min just to get one side salad then another 20 to get the rest. Next the burger I  ordered was over well done when I had told him I wanted my burger medium. That's not the bad part, it was stone cold in the middle along with cold fries. He never came by to see how our meals were, never once refilled our drinks. So we finally had to ask another waitress to ask for our waiter he must of know we weren't happy because it took another 10 min to show up to see what we wanted. Finally we told him everything that was wrong and all he could say is that he had other tables and if we needed to talk to a manager he would go get them, so another 5 to 10 min later we  finally talked to the manager, she did not seem to concerned she just asked if we wanted another burger, we just wanted to get the hell out of there. She said she would remove the burger from the bill. Funny thing she never came back with the new bill, we had to go look for her in the bar area.

Mary T.,"Altadena, CA",1,65,1,1.0,2/18/2017,"Every few months we go to Chili's and I get a half rack of ribs.  Today we made the mistake of going at 4:30pm on a Saturday.  We got seated after a 15 minute wait.  There were 3 tables of 4 near us that all ordered around the same time we did, 2 of them AFTER we ordered.  They all got their food around the same time, but they had to wait quite a while.  After they were all finished eating, and we had STILL not received any food but my asparagus side order, they explained that it was because my husband ordered a TURKEY BURGER.  What was also strange was that they brought my asparagus side order out immediately and it was cold.  We asked them to reheat it and they brought it right back, COLD, and it was the same plate, since we had tasted it, we could tell that, which is fine.  But salty and COLD again. After another 20 minutes, they came and said they would take off the $1 charge to get the premium side order!  And we could have dessert.  But we don't eat dessert.  But they could not comp us for anything else, e.g. the ridiculously expensive 9 oz and 6 oz wine ($18 plus tax and tip, and there was no way the 9 oz glass was 50% more than the 6 oz, they looked almost identical, very shy pours both of them, I'm an engineer and I'm a little OCD). Eventually the food came out.  My husband said no onions, and wanted mustard and mayo with his turkey burger.  Well he got onions but no mustard or mayo!!!  I am not kidding!  Yikes.  My half rack was cold and dried out.  I asked for extra sauce to take home, but they just brought me a little container to put the sauce I still had in!  And then the box was too small for the leftover ribs and the waiter yelled at me and said I asked for a SMALL BOX.  What I had asked for was a box, and a small container of sauce.  I had already figured out that the ribs would not fit in a small container.  We had tried to be really good sports all this time, under these circumstances, and had not even really complained except about the cold asparagus. I rarely leave less than 15%, usually 20-25%% (it's a lot to work in a restaurant) and we eat out at least 2x a day.  But when she snapped at me about asking for a larger container and wasn't willing to give me the container of bbq sauce, I did something I have not done in years.  I left no tip.  The bill was over $40 for a turkey burger, half a rack, and 2 very small glasses of wine.  I realize most of this was not her fault.  But we had not yelled at her or anything.  So her little comment about ""you asked for a small box"", maybe she did misunderstand, but again, we eat at several places who claim we are the nicest customers they have! Ironically, it was mobbed with people willing to eat here as we left.  That is okay with us, hopefully the places we want to eat at will be less crowded.  We will not be going there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=100

Our server was attentive for the most part, no complaints on her or the food. My main issue is with the cleanliness, or lack thereof.  We were seated in a booth with a meridian dividing us from the next room. The wood countertop running along the thing had a shocking amount of dust settled on it for such a big chain restaurant. The most disturbing thing I noticed was the metal sign hanging on the wall over our booth. Not sure if this sounds nit picky or not, but that sign was SO dirty. It looked like someone splashed bbq sauce all over it and no one bothered to wipe it down.

Smith M.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,17,,3.0,11/20/2015,"Hadn't been to Chili's in quite awhile.  The food was tasty, portions ample, and the service decent.  What was objectionable to me was the tables were small, and what little space was there was packed with a table lamp, an ad, a payment terminal and condiments.  There was barely room for our two plates of food.  Also, like in many restaurants today, you don't get a spoon to eat with.  Had to drink my soupy baked beans from the cup. Payment was do-it-yourself with a table top terminal.  Very impersonal.  Very minimalist. Suffice it to say, Chili's apparent business model is cold and unfeeling.  I eat out probably 10 meals a week, and like a warm welcoming environment.  This was not it.  It wasn't for me, but maybe it's for you if all you want is some tasty grub and aren't picky about the environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=100

Schel H.,"Greater Los Angeles, CA",658,1756,1544,4.0,2/29/2012,"Ok sing-a-long time... I want my baby back... baby back... baby back riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiibs... and to think out of all the trips to chili's I have ever taken, I have never had their ""award winning"" chili nor have I had their ribs. crazy stuff... But so far as a chain restaurants go this one is better than most but dont confuse that with being outstanding or great... its decent food at an average price, so i dont mind getting gift cards here as much as other places... So lets discuss this particular trip to the old Chili's B&G. It was a blistery winters eve wence the munchkin and I were faced with pangs of hunger. As I looked in the pantry to see what to prepare, the munchkin yelled out dont go there! I turned to her in a jiffy and queried what wanteth thou? She thus proclaimed, I want to go out to eat DAD! Quickly did my mind reel with wonder on what we should do. Then I recalled I had a couple of gift cards to Chili's. So we piled in the truck after checking for coupons in my email and charged off to the nearest Chili's a few miles away.  We hopped out and cruised in pulled by a tractor beam in our tummies... and we had what seemed like a million toys in tow, the munchkin had to have her my little pony, key bracelet, phone, and clifford the big red dog stuffed animal (luckily in miniture).  So onto the grub... we used our coupon for free queso and chips (they included fresh salsa too!!!), the munchkin got a corn dog and steamed broccoli with lots of ranch (somedays I wonder if she really is my daughter, then I take a look at her and know, but such odd eating habits...), and I got the classic, one of my all time favorites, Chicken Fried Steak!!! with mashers swimming in country gravy. I did a water and the munchkin for a super duper tasty slushie concoction that I want to try with about a 2:1 slushie to vodka  mixture!!! Ohhh that would be uber dangerously tasty drink. So we got our grub and the munchkin strictly wants to eat her broccoli with ranch and I practically had to force her to eat a couple of bites of her corn dog. Meanwhile I dug into my CFS, mashers, corn on the cob, and shared the garlic toast with my daughter... The grub tasted was tasty overall (except the bread had some char on the bottom)... However the portions were half what they used to be... Perhaps this is due to the economy or just how Americans are trying to cut down their portion size...  Definitely an enjoyable trip for the munchkin and I! I will be back, I have another gift card to spend :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=100

For a Chili's location I don't think this location is any nicer or worse than any other Chili's. I've been coming here for years. What I can say is the staff seems to always be friendly. I make a lot of special request that they usually have to figure out how to put into the computer. They have never complained and are helpful. They're a lot more patient that I would be in their job so it's hard to expect that from a Chili's. So 5 stars because this place is consistently good and that's kind of unexpected.

Peter H.,"Cleveland, OH",131,31,15,4.0,1/19/2015,"Chili's- it's the best restaurant ever. I know on Yelp we get into the local businesses and try and help out the mom and pop's as much as we can. But at some point, you just have to admit that Chili's can do no wrong. (See my about me section.) My wife and I came here on Saturday night and there was quite a wait (because it's Chili's and everyone in their right mind wants to eat there.) We waited about 25 minutes and then were seated- no sweat. We had all the delicious things you normally get when you go to Chili's. The chips and skillet queso are a must. The salsa is the best you will try from anywhere. Don't get pretentious. It's okay that Chili's is the best. You can just accept it. I had the southern smokehouse burger and my wife had the honey-chipotle chicken chrispers. Chili's is getting fancy with their new menus, but they really just need their old standbys. We also both had a couple of margaritas.  Paul was our server and he was THE MAN. He brought us chips and drink refills and we didn't even have to ask for them.

Over the last 6 months our family has come into the restaurant at least 4 different times and have been told that it will be a 15-blah blah minute wait, even though there are NUMEROUS empty tables. It is a staffing problem that originates with a manager or owner that does not want to hire enough staff to handle incoming traffic. You are LOSING BUSINESS which means your are LOSING MONEY. We will try the restaurant again in a few months to see if they have made any changes - but we won't be holding our breath. And if you tell us it is going to be a 10-15 minute wait where there are 15 empty tables in the restaurant, we will walk out the door just like we have the last two times we have been there.

Its 1:00 lunch hour and other than a table with a party of maybe 8, hardly anyone in the restaurant.  The guy finally appeared and asked if we wanted anything to drink, we ordered drinks, it took another ten minutes for those to appear. We ordered an appetizer sampler, it was pretty good and a chicken bowl of some kind, very bland and very spicy. We had to ask for napkins.  How do you set a table without napkins, weird. The waiter was sweet and asked if we needed a box for the bowl because he could tell we didn't enjoy it and we said no, we didn't like it.  Maybe he should have offered to take it off the bill, but I was so done, glad we could check out on the table with the self serve machine to pay.  I wont be back to Chili's, especially this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=140

It wasn't a terrible decision but it also wasn't that great. The server Kyle came over to introduce himself to us and take our drinks fairly quickly which made me very happy because that almost NEVER happens, usually I'm waiting 5-10 mins to even b noticed. So he helped us order by suggesting a few tasty things. So we ordered the 2 meal deal for $22, 2 salads, 2 entrees and that's it. I ordered steak COOKED MEDIUM! my sides were loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. My daughter ordered ribs with a side of mac n cheese. Also Kyle convinced me to get her a side of ""street corn"". When the salads came out is where the problems started! They brought us blue cheese when we clearly ordered avocado ranch. It was fine for me but my 9 year old just wasn't having it LOL. I also ordered extra cheese on both salads, which I had to ask for 2 times before we could even get it. Finally the salads were fixed and out food came out. Now u would think that since u saw my daughter was so young that you wld tell me there HOT PEPPERS cooked into the mac n cheese rite?! Well wrong! Kyle never even mentioned it at all, so as soon as she took a bite she was crying bc her mouth was on fire. My steak was bleeding all over my plate. I ended up getting a rare steak instead of medium like I ordered, and my potatoes were cold. Guess what never showed up at all tho? My street corn!! The manager was also named Kyle, at this point I felt like we knew each other for years bc I had seen him so many times in the time it took me to get our salads and dinner. Honestly if it wasn't for him I wld NEVER go back to this location ever again in life, but he was so super kind and helpful that he saved a customer for chilis. Also there was a sever in the bathroom when we went to wash our hands that I ended up giving my servers tip to bc she was even better than him and she didn't even come to our table not once! In conclusion I ended up only paying for one dinner and he wldnt even let me pay for my drinks, which I thought was very sweet of him considering all the bs I went through. I just wanted to have a nice dinner with my child since I work WAY TO MUCH and hardly ever get to spend time with her. Even tho It wasn't a great dinner or worth the money I spent it wasn't a tragedy and the manager did whatever he cld to me us happy and I appreciate that.  Step ur game up chilis please there so much compettans I'm my eyes u guys are very low on the totem pole!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=140

Let me start off with the food experience in the restaurant area.  We ordered the triple play appetizer with chicken crispers, southwest egg rolls and boneless buffalo wings and the entree was the baby back ribs (full rack) and steamed broccoli and fries on the side all to share.  This was enough food and the food at chain restaurants is usually the same quality for me so thats' why I start at 3 stars and move up or down from there.   The service was good because our server was very nice and even when we left to go to the bar area, she asked why we were leaving her area.  We told her we didn't wanna take up her booth cuz we were going to start drinking after dinner, so she understood. At the bar area, the service went downhill from there.  So when you go to the bar and you don't see a lot of people, you would expect the service to be fast and friendly but this was not the case.  The service was OK but definitely not fast.  At one point I ordered a bottle of beer and it took I would say about 10 minutes and it didn't help that I was thirsty ...... so I was thinking, how long does it take to order a beer and bring it back, especially if it's just a bottle and not draft.  Oh well, so when we were ready to go, my friend says ""maybe we should ask for the check already because we don't know how long it will take.""  When you're thinking that, you know it's a bad sign.

Spider J.,"Temple City, CA",211,87,5,2.0,9/14/2010,"The Good: Outstanding service. Really. Every single person we encountered in the half hour we spent there was a great person who tried their damnedest to do their best by us. We ended up tipping more than we ever would, just because they were so great. The Bad: It's Tex-Mex for the Midwest. Referring to it as Tex-Mex suggests that any of the owners have ever been to either Texas or Mexico. Apparently, they read about them in a book. By Disney. In England. Everything we had was extremely...meh. My husband ordered a burger, which he said was hardly worth the 3200 mg of sodium they managed to pack into it. I tried a couple of their fries, and they were too salty for me to deal with. I ordered their Express Lunch (soup, salad, and chips/salsa). The salad was about what I expected - crappy iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes and cucumber, some red onion, a couple of shreds of cheese, and too-hard croutons. I got ""balsamic"" dressing, which turned out to be this balsamic-citrus emulsion that wasn't palatable. The waitress brought me oil and red wine vinegar instead, so whatever. That was fine. But then there was the soup... In Ireland, any given soup is mixed with cream and pureed into oblivion. I survived a year there solid in my belief that no one would ever, ever inflict this upon me when I returned to California. For the nearly five years since I returned, I've been more or less supported in those beliefs. Until today when I ordered their ""Sweet Corn Soup"" for lunch and was rewarded with this mess of cream and pureed sickeningly sweet corn. I would actually be shocked to find that they didn't add HCFS to the soup, it was that sweet. So yeah. I understand that corporate food is normally bad, but this was a whole magical level of mediocrity. The only thing this place has right is apparently their hiring policies. The manager saw I had only eaten a fraction of my soup and took the price of it off of my bill, so again, great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=200

Our first point of contact was a spacey hostess who quickly wrote us off once we indicated that we'd like to sit in the bar. Then in the bar we waited for several minutes before our server arrived. She appeared to be having a bad day, so we tried to make nice, but she was not interested in pleasantries. She would ""check on us"" with an annoyed - almost angry - look on her face. At one point she said, ""You're gonna have to give me a minute!"" Nice. She must have skipped work the day she was supposed to receive customer service training. Fast forward to when we asked for our check... We showed her the free appetizer promotion we received. She said she couldn't honor it during happy hour. I asked to speak with the manager who then repeated the same thing. (That's funny because we were in recently and our server had no problem honoring a similar promotion. Too bad that server wasn't working today - she was nice.) Basically our server and the manager refused to budge over an appetizer that's only worth a few bucks. Well, they lost a couple of customers as a result of their overall poor service, bad attitudes, and refusal to be reasonable.   The food was a little salty, but not bad for happy hour prices, hence the 2-star review.

They were the most tasteless fajitas ever, I actually had to salt/pepper and use the watered down Tabasco sauce they offered me to make it taste like something, anything! I can't be certain but I think the stomachache I got later that night had something to do with the fajitas, just sayin'. The bf had the Baby Back Ribs in two different sauces, and he said it was just okay, but that he has had way better, and he won't bother ordering them again there. This coming from a man who rarely EVER complains about food!!!  The prices didn't seem appropriate to the portion sizes or overall flavor of the meal. The fajitas were $12.99 with no sides, as sides cost .99 extra. The lack of cheese, tomatoes and tortillas is also irritating. The cheese wasn't even enough for one fajita!!!

What a shame~  Nothing was memorable about my experience. We came for lunch. Ate off the lunch menu. I got the Half smoked Turkey sandwich with a cup of Baked Potato soup. The dish came with fries. There was a lot of food on my plate for $7.89. The bread for my sandwich tasted a little old and the soup was to salty. Wife got the beef sliders with a side of soup. Her dish was over $10.00 and unimpressive as well. Meat was dry and over seasoned.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~America~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The way to your heart is threw your stomach.  Big Plate of Food~  Bad for you~  Tasteless~  Salty~  $30.00 dollars worth.  No thanx  Cheers~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=220

Jesse L.,"Glendale, CA",2,28,,4.0,5/20/2008,"So most people reading this are aware (and if they're not be advised) Chili's is a chain restaurant.  I am grading it based on other chain restaurants in the same general price category (Applebee's, TGI Fridays, etc.).  This would not be the place to go if you are looking for truly authentic Tex-Mex fare.  That being said, for a chain restaurant, Chili's makes some tasty food.  As a former suburban midwesterner, Chili's always reminds me a little of home.  The food is comparatively inexpensive and consistently good.   I'm actually a little surprised at the other reviews here-- I've been many times, and I've always found the service at this Chili's location to be above average.  Maybe I always get lucky, but I can't remember a time at this restaurant where I didn't have a server that was quick to deliver refills and check to make sure everything was okay.  It is true-- this location is usually on a pretty long wait on the weekends.  I'm not sure that this can be held against the restaurant-- after all, it just means people want to eat there.   As far as food goes, I always start with the chips and salsa.  Again, there is nothing terribly authentic about the salsa, but it is a little spicy and a lot addictive.  I think that Chili's does burgers, sandwiches, and salads best.  The Cajun Chicken Sandwich is particularly tasty. So maybe it's lowbrow of me to admit it, but I like Chili's.  And I like the Monrovia location.  As far as chain restaurants go, you could do a lot worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=240

Our server never checked on us after we placed our order (which took about 30 mins of waiting to do).  We had to flag him down repeatedly to get drink refills, fix the numerous mistakes on our order, get utensils, etc.  What was he doing instead?  No, not busy checkin on other tables...but instead chatting it up in plain sight of our table with other servers. The only thing that prevents me from giving this place 1-star, is their food which is tasty when prepared correctly, and their manager Susie who is amazing.  I don't know how she deals with a whole bunch of unmotivated teen/college-age employees, but she is professional, courteous, honest, and gracious. After waiting an hour for our food, and finding out that they ran out of french fries, she apologized profusely and gave us our dinner for free (at least the portion that we actually got from the kitchen). She turned an unpleasant experience into a memorable one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=260

Francine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1577,1658,3141,1.0,2/29/2008,"I'm sorry but I have to agree that this place sucks on service. I have tried coming here time after time since friends love eating at Chili's but this time was  unbelievable. To start off there was no customers but for some reason the service was still very bad. I was waiting at a table with a friend and we waited for 10 minutes for some waitress to come and actually tell us that she will be right back . Another 5 minutes goes by and she then comes back and says she will take our order after she gets back. We weren't happy and said to her that we need to order right now. So we put the order, very simple it was just a simple burger and also ribs. Alrighty well it took us around 30 minutes to get anything no drink or no food....It is sad but I've always known this chili's or many other Chili places to have very bad service. I don't understand why it took so long she didn't have people to wait on and she still took her damn time....Food was fine but the wait for it is not worth it. I don't think they even try to give you good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=260
Steve M.,"Hollywood, CA",75,174,31,3.0,3/6/2007,I used to work here years ago(in Ohio) so I know how things work.  I got a pickup order and it was ready within 5 minutes.  The food tasted really good but the portions were lacking.  This was Friday at 7pm so the restaurant was very busy.  I would have rather gone and sat down to eat but the wait was 40 minutes.  I would go back and probably will this week as I have a soft spot for their Margaritas.  They are quite tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=260
Lana L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,848,62,1.0,11/4/2007,"I've never been much of a Chili's fan. Well, actually the only thing I've really ever enjoyed is the mushroom burger. But it would be nice to try something different for a change. And boy was that  a bad idea. Practically everything else is deep fried. Eww.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=260
RS P.,"San Antonio, TX",2,38,,1.0,3/9/2010,"Oh my goodness! All I can say is food poisoning! My brother and cousin both got food poisoning from eating the beef there. Luckily, I had a salad with no meat. They were throwing up for 24 hours. Oh man! And, everything was  a mess. The dishware was dirty. I had to send my water glass back twice because there were food particles in the water. Ewww. Plus the food there just tastes old. The company was very nice though and refunded our meal, and provided us with cash vouchers to Chili's again! Why again? We got food poisoning the first time. Why would we go back?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=260
R M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",78,33,,3.0,1/31/2010,"The many times I have gone to Chili's, I have had bad expriences or good expriences.  I have done so many customer service surveys for them and I truly think they do not take them in consideration.  They are never at level of effiency. It takes forever to get a drink from the bar. The triple decker app is 10 bucks, but only 3 of each food item. That is not a saving.  They are trying to be healthy, but there food it still high in Calories.  Food portions have gone down a lot, but we still pay a high price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=260

Felicia M.,"Placentia, CA",27,61,,1.0,8/9/2007,"Last time we went, my daughter had to use the restroom. When we came back, our table was all amiss. Some of my food was in her plate. Our napkins and silverware had been replaced and everythign was moved around. Apparently, they had bussed our table, realized the mistake and tried to put everything back without telling us. I stop eating because who knows what they did with our food. I asked the waitress about it & she didn't even apologize or ask if everything was ok. And yes, it takes at least 3 requests to get your drink refilled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=260
Lauri W.,"San Jose, CA",13,19,,2.0,8/5/2007,"How many times do you think it takes to ask for and receive a drink refill? Well at our latest venture to this Chili's the answer was 3. The first time the waiter, Jeff, noticed on his own. Good Boy Jeff! 15 minutes later when he brought our food, but not our drinks, we asked him for a refill. After another 15 minutes in which we witnessed him taking orders and bringing drinks to other customers, he happened to look over the side of the booth and noticed that we still did not have our drinks. FINALLY, 5 minutes after that we got our refills. This isn't rocket science people! All we wanted was 2 waters and a soda, nothing complicated, probably something that was in a pitcher around the corner from our booth. He never even acknowledged that it had taken him over 30 minutes and 3 requests to fulfill our request. No apology, nothing. Now I've been to this Chili's many times. The food is usually good, but the service is so inconsistent that I'm seriously doubting I'll go there again if I have my choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=260
