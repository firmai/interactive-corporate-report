Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1412,6952,3.0,8/10/2017,"On a late night trip from Fort Lauderdale to Naples, we got hungry wanted a sit down meal. At this time, pretty much only the TGI Friday's was open which made us a little nervous because were weren't really the biggest fans, but when you're in a pinch you gotta do what you gotta do. Because of the time we were seated immediately and our server took our drink orders. Then came time to order our meal. For an appetitizer I got some of their broccoli soup and ordered their Jack Daniels chicken (which isn't that what they're known for) for my meal.It came witth two sides: I chose broccoli and macaroni and cheese ( gotta have one good with one bad, right?) The soup had a great taste to it, but could have been a little warmer. Don't you hate getting lukewarm soup? Ugh. The shredded cheese on top took a little to melt because of this. The meal comes with two pieces of chicken covered in that famous marinade which I was surprised, were pretty juicy! the mac and cheese was amazing, of course thanks to the bread crumbs on top. Everything is better with some sort of breading. Overall things weren't too bad! Sometimes I give places like this such a low expectation marker when really I shouldn't. There was nothing really wrong with the meal. Some things could have been better, like the soup, but that wouldn't keep me from coming back. A-ok by me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Don K.,"Bonita Springs, FL",0,2,,1.0,12/23/2017,"My wife and granddaughter ate at this Friday's on Dec 18, at 4:53pm. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but they sat us back by the kitchen.  (In hindsight we should have asked for a different table) We sat for a while before a waitress acknowledged us and took our drink order. Then for a while before she returned and took our food order. (By a while, longer than we're used to, and certainly longer based on  the small amount of other customers) Food was OK. Waitress never came back to check on our order or drink refills. ALSO, sitting by the kitchen there was a constant amount of loud yelling coming from the kitchen. We left a small tip and left. Also, we hadn't been to this Friday's in years, thought we'd give it another try. Bad mistake, it'll be years or never before we return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Joseph C I.,"Estero, FL",136,84,51,4.0,8/22/2017,I have not been here for a long time. I was here twice and had a so so experience. This time was different . I was greeted warmly the place was empty.  I was presented with the rewards and it worked out great . I ordered a smoothie and it was great in fact all of our food was great. I will be back. Oh and the bathrooms were clean!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2

Bill A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",8,38,,2.0,10/21/2017,Was intrigued by the massive ad campaign for a full rack of bigger ribs at $12 so we ignored the bad reviews and stopped by.  We were there at 11:00 but the doors  did not open until 11:30 and we saw a few people drive off.  The waitress was the high point of the visit being cheerful and attentive.  We learned that the $12 deal was only for takeout and if you ate in the price increased to $21 so me wife ordered a half rack and I had the sampler.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender but the flavor is painted on which is understandable as there are four options. Not a big deal for the rank and file but a bbq purist will be disappointed.   The rest of my sampler was over breaded and over cooked.  This restaurant is an acceptable option for young people or young families moving up from fast food but those with more mature tastes will likely be disappointed.  If there was an option for 2 1/2 stars I would give it and had they opened on time possibly 3 but $40 will buy a much better lunch for two nearly anywhere else in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2

Teri P.,"Lake Zurich, IL",29,54,52,4.0,1/16/2017,First time to this location. Apps at bar with Chicken Tortilla soup is a perfect lunch. Nice services a well.

They are the best!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Female U.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,9,2,1.0,2/1/2017,"Still awful service. Molly is the worst bartender and Alley is just as awful. Apparently,  5 people at the bar is too many and too much for both of them. Waiting in line at publix during season wouldn't have taken as long as getting a cocktail from them. This kind of service needs to pay for you to be there. Food subpar but it is served till 2, that is IF you can get a bartender (even while sitting at bar) to take your order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Jamie K.,"Naples, FL",72,614,5,2.0,6/9/2016,"Newer location, but seems like an old typical Fridays. Slow service, food was not warm. Dirty place, food all over the floor. Fridays used to be one of the best chain restaurants and now it is one of the worst. The one in Naples closed, so we decided to try the one in Estero, mistake. Now I know why the one in Naples closed. Food tasted old and not freshly made. Noone seemed like they wanted to be there. Not too cheap for what we ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2

cheri t.,"Haverhill, MA",6,225,,5.0,6/20/2017,"Really enjoyed the happy meal half off apps yesterday.  The boneless wings, sliders and flat bread were excellent, and the portion size was large.  They are full orders even though half priced, ($5).  We had 5 apps for $25.00, you cannot beat that and we took quite a bit home.  Server was good, place was very quiet.  Also, very nice inside and clean.  Want to go again today!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Glenn B.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",4,69,59,4.0,7/31/2016,"Just me at TGI's tonight. Let's see how long before i see my server... about two minutes. The hostess had said her name Joann, but she didn't have a name tag nor introduced herself. The rib deal that was advertised got me in, but it's no where to be found inside here. I got a rack of ribs, mashed potatoes,  broccoli and a water. This place is about 10% full. 4 minutes to get a water. These use ""We-cal"" as a sugar substitute here, I guess the regular stuff costs too much? Small portion of potatoes and broccoli,  but to be expected for the discount deal. Food arrived in a timely manner. Server quick to arrive with extra sauce. All was good,  good food.. Screaming kids nearby... (hate that). The bill said that a 20% tip would have been $4.08, when it would be $2.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Meredith C.,"Miami, FL",6,19,2,1.0,6/10/2016,"Disgusting! DON'T EAT HERE! I third of the restaurants tables weren't cleaned. One table across from us sat uncleared our entire meal. At least six people walked past without even pulling the plates off the table. I'm surprised the health inspector hasn't shut this place down. I also wouldn't be surprised if the cleanliness of the kitchen wasn't up to par if that's how they treat their front of house and if there was a manager on duty, he definitely wasn't inspecting what he expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Asma A.,"Fort Myers, FL",6,76,30,4.0,10/23/2016,"A typical franchise Friday's restaurant, the burgers are really good, the drinks taste good, also the Mahi Mahi on grill tastes really fresh, overall atmosphere is nice but the waitresses do have a little attitude which felt unprofessional!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
James C.,"Naples, FL",33,12,,5.0,5/6/2017,Surprised to see all this negativeness. We eat here often and haven't had anything remotely related to the bad reviews seen here.  Maybe I'm just lucky.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Jennifer G.,"Naples, FL",3,6,,5.0,9/18/2016,This is our favorite spot for date nights. The food is great and so is the atmosphere. I love the their rum punches. The chicken and mashed potatoes are to die for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Vince C.,"Estero, FL",0,3,,1.0,9/4/2017,I used to enjoy tgi's endless appetizers. I was at this one last night and I realized that they play it real nice at first. We sat at the bar. Our first order was fine and before we even start eating them the server said should I put your next order in. Of course we said. Then we finished and the next one came out but she walked away this time. Finished that round and no one to be seen. There were only 6 people at the bar.  But the two girls were gone. 15 minutes later one come by and says sorry honey and fill my drink that was empty for a while. So now we wait another 15 minutes for the next round. It comes out and she walks away again. A half hour later we see her. We couldn't wait around any longer so we had to leave. Very disappointed. So we get the bill and they have in there that the total would have been $71 if would would have paid $10 for the little bowl of. Nachos and $8 for BBQ chicken flat bread the size of a cell phone. Come fridays get it right. Treat you customers the way the should be treated. On top of that the bartender circled the tip % for me so I would leave her $17 for not coming over to see if I wanted more appetizers or to refill our drinks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2
Ang Z.,"Estero, FL",0,2,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Absolutely horrible service. Every single time ive gone ive waited 15 minutes for a drink order and eventually got up to get the server.

Susan D.,"Atlanta, GA",17,23,,1.0,1/3/2016,"I keep trying to give this place a chance. The service at this location ( excepting a bartender named Corey that actually seems to care about the customers) is HORRIBLE Boring and bored bartenders servers and hosts all headed up by a man that appeared briefly and seemed as unengaged as his staff I like their food , have tons of Friday's I love however sadly this one isn't among that collection.

Lauren M.,"Naples, FL",0,7,,1.0,5/31/2015,"Time of visit: 7 pm. Sunday 2 top table Order:  Mozzarella sticks as appetizer Bruschetta pasta with chicken Chicken tenders, adult portion Price: $26 Positives:  Hostess was very polite Server was polite  Our table and bathrooms were very clean  Negatives:  Unclean patio Appetizer never came Food took longer than necessary Food was cold Refills never offered Server was only seen upon ordering and check Other tables remained dirty through duration of visit Check came but server was nowhere to be found and as such had to use cash Manager was nowhere to be found If we had needed change, I have no idea what we would have done  Final thoughts: I had never been to a tgi Fridays; however, I have been to similar places (chilis, Applebee's, etc). After this visit, I will never return to a tgi Fridays again. I went here with the intention of going to a different place in coconut point than usual, and I was exceptionally disappointed. I am a waitress myself, and I understand that the food was not our servers fault. But we never received our appetizer despite our order being repeated back to us in conformation. The place was not busy enough to warrant the lack of service performed. I regret to say this, but I tipped with pennies.

Taylor D.,"Naples, FL",18,101,50,5.0,3/1/2015,"Well it's not often I give a chain 5stars but this time Friday's deserved it. Came for a late lunch with my wife. The manager opens the door for us and was very nice and status down. We were at the booths near the bar. But our waiter comes and takes our food and drink order with a smile on the whole time. He was attentive with bringing our drinks and along sure everything was alright. The food was good and the service was fantastic. Friday's gets 5stars because there is nothing I can complain about and will come back.

George K.,"Naples, FL",0,4,,2.0,3/19/2016,"We have been to this one a few times and most of the times everything was good. But, the other day, we had a early dinner and the food was awful. My wife ordered the pecan-crusted chicken salad and was terrible. The chicken was well over done, the ends were so hard you couldn't cut them with a knife. The lettuce was wilted. I ordered a JD burger medium and what I got was a very well done burger. In addition, our chips were dripping with grease. In addition, we had to wait over a half hour for our food, because the kitchen was a little behind. On a positive note, the wait staff was great and the drinks and refills came promptly. We will try this one more time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2?start=20
Erica B.,"Naples, FL",11,8,,4.0,12/5/2015,"Great late night service at the bar last night. The patron who puked in the middle of the bar, however, did not add to the overall experience.

Danielle D.,"Bradenton, FL",131,411,96,2.0,7/26/2014,"Eh....I used to love Fridays so I wanted to come here.  Came once and it was fine but last night's meal was 2 star worthy. A friend of mine and I shared the pretzels and cheese app and it was just ok.  We both had the pick 3 app as our dinner and this is where the real disappoint was.  The potstickers had dried, hard edges..you can tell they were simply heated up from the freezer-the edges may have been freezer burnt.  The mozzarella sticks where fine but the boneless buffalo wings were yuk! Just didn't like them at all. The ones at Applebees are 10x better (and that really isn't saying much!) My friend had the garlic parm and those were much better.  Service was fine-no complaints.  Not sure if all Fridays' food taste like this or it is just this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2?start=20

The food has been, simply mediocre. Portion size is not consistent, neither is temperature on the steaks.  I know it's a chain and it's hard to expect more but I feel like they could really do better.

J P.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,97,,3.0,4/22/2015,"It's what's  expected from a Fridays and that pretty much the only reason we stopped there. Not very much in the immediate area to choose from that's worth the stop. Second visit here and the service was just as slow as the first visit. Not sure what the slowness is caused by, but with an attendance of about14, plus the bar,  it's very slow. An hour lunch would be impossible here. The staff is always pleasant  and the manager seems to make an effort to visit and inquire about your food. It gets an ""okay.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2?start=20
Tyler H.,"Fort Myers, FL",67,148,23,2.0,3/21/2013,"The good: Food was prepared competently (yes, I know, there's a lot of pre-prep that happens outside the store), and was actually quite enjoyable. The bad: Service sucked. Badly enough that I only tipped 10% (I'm normally a 20%+). Took forever to get drink refills (I ran out of Sprite before the apps were delivered. The refill arrived halfway through the entree. My wife ran out of water partway through the apps. No refill for her :(  ). Waitress didn't know how their loyalty program worked, and never bothered to either find out or to find someone who did. Really, why have a loyalty program if you're not going to get your staff to be at least competent at working with it? The verdict: It's a fast-casual chain restaurant. The one thing that distinguishes TGI Fridays from Ruby Tuesday or Applebees is the service (let's face it, the menus are basically identical -- burgers, fried-chicken-based entrees, shrimp, pasta, and salads.). Since the service here is lacking, there's no compelling reason to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-estero-2?start=20

Shawn P.,"Estero, FL",0,2,,1.0,12/11/2014,"I will start with the fact that I have been here before tonight and sat a a table, and the service and food were fine. However after tonight I will never go back. Me and a buddy came in at about midnight to catch a couple of drinks after work, upon arrival it took 10 minutes to be acknowledged sitting at a bar with 2 bartenders. I will say the drinks were delicious, however the service earns this review 1 star. I work in the industry and I understand if it was busy, that I have to wait a bit for a drink, but for my last drink, my glass was empty for 23 minutes and my attempts to get either of the two bartenders to acknowledge me were futile ( there were 6 people at the bar, no tables and two bartenders ) the bartenders seemed much more interested in socializing with each other than making a drink. I can honestly say without a shadow of a doubt this is the worst service I have ever had and I will not return ever again. I have never in my life tipped less than 30% and today I left 10%.
