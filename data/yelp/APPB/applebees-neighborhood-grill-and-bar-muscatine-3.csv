David B.,"Independence, MO",0,1,,5.0,8/31/2017,My first time in an Applebee's. Ordered the sirloin with parmesan shrimp. Fantastic! Steak cooked perfectly. Garlic green beans with bacon were to die for. I will definitely be back to Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Zach A.,"Chicago, IL",183,505,13,2.0,1/19/2016,"I ordered a steak, what a terrible cut of meat! it was fatty and not tasty. Where were the mushrooms? 2 slices were buried in all  the onions. Blah! And the salad was dry with little dressing and not like the picture. But the waitress was nice, hence the 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
D K.,"Downers Grove, IL",161,24,5,5.0,2/13/2017,"Chad is a real pro - seriously. Explained the offerings and beers on tap while salting my coaster so it did not keep sticking to my glass.  He said it was ""an old bartender's trick."" Never seen that before and I have seen too many old bartenders. Nice touch with real friendly service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Ted W.,"Jamestown, TN",1452,251,7,4.0,10/6/2015,"Stopped in for lunch not much of a selection in his area but enjoyed my meal, very friendly Southern style waitstaff always a pleasure.

Roland H.,"Muscatine, IA",0,11,,5.0,3/13/2017,The Monday night burgers and fries for $6.99 is a good deal and the food is fantastic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
McKenzie G.,"Dixon, IL",8,24,,2.0,2/22/2016,I have been super disappointed our last couple trips  here that we very likely won't return. On 1 occasion my New York strip steak was completely gristle & fat throughout then another time my pasta dish was more like soup bathing in thin nasty sauce where I couldn't even see the pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Jan T.,"Tipton, IA",0,10,,5.0,12/5/2015,"Had dinner there Friday and can't wait to go back. Food was the best, seated right away with wait staff to great us, our waiter came and took our order and was very friendly and well versed of the menu to answer any of our questions. He checked on us numerous times. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Establishment very clean.Would definitely recommend going to anyone. Will be going back in two weeks when going to Muscatine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Deb D.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,17,1,4.0,9/17/2015,"Applebee's has the best burgers!  Our waitress, Julia R was one an awesome server - so pleasant, helpful & really seems to like her job. Delicious Ruby grapefruit Ling Island Ice Tea",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Luke T.,"Tucker, GA",429,615,645,3.0,11/9/2011,"Everything is relative.. and in Muscatine, IA, this Applebees may be your best best for consistent service and food. I sat at the bar and was helped immediately. Folks are friendly and service is fast. Food is Applebees quality.  I asked the bartender,.. ""What is there to do in Muscatine, IA?'..  she said.. ""Nothing,... you should try to leave""..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Melle R.,"Muscatine, IA",0,2,,1.0,4/26/2015,Everything you can expect from an Applebee's and the bonus of a super creepy manager leering at his teenage waitresses.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Leslie H.,"Carmel, IN",319,396,346,4.0,5/27/2013,"It's a great neighborhood bar and grill since there's not a whole lot of options in the area. There are a lot of regulars who come here and hang out at the bar, order their decent priced lunch menu and have a beer or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Ellen E.,"Phoenix, AZ",16,165,4,4.0,12/29/2012,"When everything else in Muscatine is closed because of a blizzard, you can count on Applebee's to be open. The menu has been revamped, so it's slightly more upscale than it was and there are plenty of menu options. Service can be a bit slow, but that's because they're making up for all the other restaurants closing early. Applebee's is what it is and for that, 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Nestor N.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,8/3/2014,"This place is real dirty . They had a lot of garbage on floor. Had the worse lunch ever flys all over my table, mash potatoes old so as coleslaw were old,real upset stomach after  stoping in there",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
David P.,"Eden Prairie, MN",128,231,919,3.0,1/6/2011,"Standard Applebees. This is your standard neighborhood Applebees.  The McDonalds of sit down restaurants.  There isn't anything particularly bad about this one.  They do have a decent happy hour, somewhat friendly and efficient staff, and the food is edible. As you will find in many similar restaurants the staff likes to take it easy, eat their own meals and converse with friends of the staff and non staff.  While eating at the bar I watched about 10 different workers sit down at a table behind me and scarf down dinners.   Overall, its a somewhat safe bet in a town filled with things you have probably never heard of.  Also conveniently located next door to my hotel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
Carin E.,"Chicago, IL",3,28,,2.0,1/9/2012,"I was somewhat disappointed. My bread sticks were cold and dry. For the price of my meal I expected better service from the waitstaff. Even after having pushed my plates to the end of the table, the waitstaff didn't seem to get it (back and fourth and no clearing). Mgmt needs to retrain some of it's waitstaff as well as cooks. The good thing is the cocktails and drinks made up for it.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-muscatine-3
