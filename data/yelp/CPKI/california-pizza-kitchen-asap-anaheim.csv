Steve S.,"Fullerton, CA",8,35,2,4.0,11/28/2007,"If you're looking for some quick and easy pizza in the Anaheim area, California Pizza Kitchen Express is it. Think of it as fast food style ordering meets sit down restaurant.  From personal experience, ordering a large pizza alone is more than enough for 2-3 people. I had to literally eat standing up to finish off those last few slices when I went with a friend (yes it works to some extent).  In addition to pizza, this location has pasta and sandwiches. Expect to shell out around $20 or so (pizza + entree) for two people, with drinks.  Just don't come during lunch hours or between 12:00pm - 1:30pm Monday through Friday (tons of corporate people), unless you don't mind waiting 30 minutes for your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-anaheim
Abbe W.,"Irvine, CA",619,617,1263,4.0,1/23/2007,We came the second day after it opened. Great and tasty pizza. This is an express version of CPK.  It has mostly pizza and sandwiches. You ordered at the cashier and the food will be brought to you like Pat & Oscar's and Pei-Wei. California style of dining. The portion might be a little small so it may seem unsatisfying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-anaheim
Tila E.,"Long Beach, CA",10,48,,3.0,11/7/2008,"It was good while it lasted, but now, this CPK is closed. It is now a Zito's pizza. Luckily, the Zito's is pretty awesome...well except for the pasta...and the salad....they suck. okay, so maybe not awesome, but definitely alright",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-anaheim
Alicia Y.,"Irvine, CA",14,25,,5.0,4/8/2007,"This CPK has Dine-In, Take-Out, and Grab n' Go capability. =) It's fairly new to the area - came in with all the new development around the Angel Stadium. The food came out really quick and it was just as good as the regular CPK. Of course, the seating situation was not as nice or comfortable, but it was spacious and clean. It's very near: Angel Stadium, Honda Center, the Grove, and many office buildings. Our only concern was the parking situation, because there are other popular shops (Starbucks, Hooters, Quiznos, and a couple other businesses) sharing the same parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-anaheim
Denise A.,"Irvine, CA",284,371,321,1.0,4/28/2008,Boo! I don't know how but this place went out at this particular location.  Every time I drove by it was always packed until I drove by and they were gone :(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-anaheim
D B.,"San Francisco, CA",300,250,2,4.0,11/19/2008,"If you don't think of it as pizza, it's better.  In fact, I really like CPK.  Everything always tastes good.  It's not health food and it's not a quiet place and it might be trendy, but the portions are large for the price.  I always find something on their menu that satisfies me.  The service is usually good.  It's one of the better chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-asap-anaheim
