200,Brandon T.,"Portland, OR",157,400,348.0,3.0,2012-10-03,"This review stems from a late night visit just one day after the grand opening, so please take any praise or criticism with a grain of salt. Also, despite this chain's propensity to receive innuendo filled comments, I will hold back for the time being. I feel that I should take it easy on them seeing as when it comes to getting reviewed it is this location's very first time.  I am giving BJ's a solid three star rating because they are getting off to a good start and I will definitely be coming back.  Now, this shop purports to be a brewhouse and they easily stand up to the test with about a dozen and half of their own brews on tap. They also feature a respectable list of 'guest beers', so you'll have an easy time finding something that you like. I tried the Jeremiah Red and I'd get it again on my next visit if I weren't so intrigued about their other flavors. Three drinks in particular caught my eye: the Berry Burst Cider (not a brew), P.M. Porter (nitro), and the Tatonka Imperial Stout.  We also tried one of their famed Pizookies, a warm cookie topped with ice cream. Specifically we got the red velvet Pizookie but I have a feeling that they all provide that same experience, one of deliciously guilty indulgence.  I wish I could comment more on the food but I didn't even see anything else besides the two excellent looking mini pizzas that a waitress mistakenly brought to our table. Now this brings me to the service, which I'm inclined to be kind about simply because this place is brand spanking new. However, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't perturbed by how long it took for them to verify my apparently cryptic out of state ID (10+ min). To add confusion to annoyance it took at least five additional minutes to deliver my drink even though I was no more than ten feet from the bar and there were about twice as many waiters as patrons.  Overall though, the service was cordial and I'm sure their efficiency will improve with practice.  Again, I will be back especially since I want to check this place out during a big game (monster screen over the bar) and there is a long list of beer that I've yet to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=160,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
79,Kristen M.,"Hillsboro, OR",948,916,922.0,3.0,2012-10-05,"They started construction in May and finished in October!!!! Yes, its one of my favorite chains.  Yes, they just opened (on 10/01/2012). Yes, this place looks a bit cookie-cutter (reminds me of the Torrance, Del Amo location) Yes, they are quite busy since they just opened. Yes, they are working out the kinks and are still in training (so expect delays) Yes, I ordered BJ's favorite deep dish pizza to-go (*my fave*) Yes, I also ordered a pizookie to-go (*my fave*)  The waiter asked how many utensils I wanted for my pizookie and I said two because I was embarrassed that to admit the whole thing was for me =X  He didn't listen to me anyways and ended up giving me four utensils LOL...... Parking can be a bit chaotic as well since they just opened. But if you're ordering to-go, they also have parking spots near the handicapped section for your convenience! And yes I'll come back, hoping that service will run smoothly and probably go during their ""off"" hours so I can get lighting, speedy service.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=120,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

309,Sharon M.,"Portland, OR",24,175,3.0,3.0,2012-10-10,"I always liked BJ's when I ate there in Southern California, and sometimes I would go out of my way to eat at the one in Jantzen Beach.  I really am happy they opened one in Hillsboro.  Considering they opened the beginning of the month, it seems like they are already in the swing of things.  here were 5 of us in the group, and we got seated right away.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, an service was quite good.  For a chain restaurant, everything was good.  I had a new item - a quesadilla, and I was surprised it had so much flavor.  My husband's pasta was a little over cooked, and they were out of their homemade cream soda.  Maybe next time.  Overall, it was a fine experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=260,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003
289,Brett L.,"Portland, OR",35,113,18.0,4.0,2012-10-13,"I was hesitant to visit this new spot after looking over the spotty reviews but my experience here was a good one. Roy was my bartender and he did a fantastic job. He sold me on the Pumpkin Ale. Yum! That alone was worth the visit. I ordered some food to go (which was packaged perfectly) and enjoyed my brew while I waited.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The staff looked good and seemed to be having a good time as well. Lots of smiles and energy. The layout and atmosphere in the bar is perfect if you like to ""see and be seen"" and it seems to be going well as they were still fairly busy after midnight. This is probably the only ""happening"" place in Hillsboro after 10pm. The dining area looked a little more intimate and cozy with lots of very comfortable looking booths. My dissapointments from my experience: They were out of the Nutty Brunette and the IPA (the two best brews they have). Also there was no apparant posting for happy hour specials, though I looked for them in the menu. I was given the information, however, when I asked my bartender if they host a happy hour. Roy informed me that in addition to the 4-7pm happy hour they run a special happy hour during primetime NFL slots. I'll be seeing you folks for some cold brews and NFL action soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=200,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004
279,Melina H.,"The Colony, TX",78,310,15.0,4.0,2012-10-13,"I am NOT a fan of chain restaurants, but I was really impressed by BJ's (although, and i know it's totally wrong, the name makes me snicker every time - just sayin').  The hubs and I sat at the bar and were quickly greeted by a peppy lil' blond gal who was more than happy to help explain some of their house brews to us. Once we settled in with our choices (I chose a seasonal brew - delish - and the hubs ordered a blond - he liked mine better), we began to study the absolutely MASSIVE menu. Now, big menus normally scare me because it's extremely difficult to perfect a menu this large, however all the food that passed by us looked scrumptious. I ordered a tapa sized wonton appetizer with thai inspired chicken filling and one of their lunch sized specials with a flatbread and salad while the hubs ordered a personal deep dish pizza. The lunch specials are very inexpensive - under $10 and they are ""right sized"" for a light lunch. Hubs ordered the spicy meatball pizza and loved it. I've travelled a lot to Chicago for work and found the pizza ""just ok"".  Service was wonderful. The manager came out a few minutes after we ordered and apologized for being out of the thai filling so I made a second choice but was pleasantly surprised to receive the thai chicken anyway - he was covering his bases, which I really appreciated. The bartenders was attentive withough being pushy. HH specials are pretty amazing as well and are posted. Prices for pizza are good - we are looking forward to taking the kiderinos in here, ordering a pizza with some homemade soda and watching a game together as a family...there is not a bad view in the place. Highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=200,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004
262,Jessica F.,"Hillsboro, OR",6,7,,2.0,2012-10-15,"Went in on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty busy had to wait about 20 minutes for our table. Once seated our server came over right away, she was very pleasant and attentive. She brought our drinks and appetizers in a  timley manner. The appetizers were ""okay"". We ordered the crispy artichoke hearts and stuffed mushrooms. The artichoke hearts were pretty good and came with an aioli dip, I would probably order these again. The mushrooms weren't hot when they arrived and were really just ok We did end up waiting a very long time for our entrees...Once they arrived my fiances burger was over cooked and  mine was cold. We don't usually send food back but we did...They brought out my fiances burger again within about 10-15 minutes and it was perfect, I had to wait close to another 10 minutes after his dish arrived for the second time to get my food. It came out hot, but it wasn't an amazing dish. The manager was very apologetic and did not want to make any excuses and really wanted to make us happy. All in all the people they have working there are really great, at least on the floor. The food was really just not anything special, If we go back we will probably just order the pizza which actually looked really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=300,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

162,Raja S.,"Hillsboro, OR",99,310,12.0,5.0,2012-10-21,"[Tried both the Hillsboro, Eugene locations: very consistent taste, service: Both 5-stars] Pretty good food. We tried these: Beer sampler: Good way to try most of their beers:      Berry Cider with some alcohol: pretty good, my wife liked it.      Blonde Ale: Pretty good (hoppy).      BJs Lightswitch Lager: their lightest beer, Not for me but my wife liked it.      Harvest hefeweizen: Prefer the Widmer Brother's Hefeweizen.      Tatonka Stout: pretty good (has a coffee taste): Liked on multiple occasions. Appetizers: Chicken Wontons (Buffalo style): Awesome, must try (though unhealthy)... however, this menu item has been discontinued. Chicken wings (i think we went with XXXtra Hot - 5 Pepper buffalo): though not too hot for us, it was quite good. Crispy Calamari: Quite good. Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps: Decent, I could have had it without the mango, which gives it a sweet taste... to me no restaurant has matched the P.F.Changs Lettuce Wraps. Avocado Egg Rolls: Loved them... not my wife's favorite Spinach & Artichoke Dip: Pretty good, my wife liked it even more than I did. Santa Fe Spring Rolls: Great taste. Basically everything in the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo was good... highly recommended if you go as a group. Entrees: Jambalaya (with chicken, shrimp) was just awesome.  [I prefer the shrimp or chicken over the sausage].  Tried this dish multiple times (recommended to everyone of my friends & all of them loved it). The way they cooked the shrimp in both of the above dishes was just awesome... succulent and right flavor. California Chicken sandwich: Pretty good. Lobster dish with Salmon (seems seasonal/local dish): Was just okay... could avoid it. Moroccan Spice Salmon: This is not a spicy dish (though it looks spicy) as Moroccan spice is different... decent... considering that they have other great items, this might not be a repeat dish for me. Wedge cut fries were just okay... should go with crispy thin fries. Dessert: BJs Brownie: Awesome... the cookie was just warm enough and hot fudge. BJs famous Pizookie: Wasn't great... the vanilla was quite ordinary and it did not go well with the warm cookie underneath.  Large  portion. Nice atmosphere, nice service.  Only wished, they had bigger sized TVs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=140,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001

284,Christopher W.,"Hillsboro, OR",4,34,10.0,4.0,2012-10-29,"Never been to a BJ's before. If anyone is like me in the Hillsboro area, imagine a Cheesecake Factory only less cheesecake and more decent pizza. Pretty blown away by the quality of the food, I had thought this was just a big brewery with food as well. Not so. We tried the chicken lettuce wraps, a cheese pizza, and the New York steak. The cheese pizza and chicken wraps were phenomenal. Way better than we were expecting (then again we're not hard to please). The steak on the other hand was bad. No seasoning, no flavor. It seems they just unwrapped the meat and cooked it plain, and the same goes for the veggies that came with it. Not a big deal, but if you're going to charge $15 I would hope you do something a little bit beyond letting it sit on the grill for a few minutes. Maybe some salt? I dunno. You're better off getting an awesome pizza for the price. The prices are actually pretty good for a place like this. $30 for the steak, chicken wraps, and a meal for the kid. Portions are decently sized and my wife and I had no trouble sharing a single meal with an appetizer. Beyond the bland steak everything else was cool. The staff is all very nice, the joint is super clean, and hell even the bathrooms were impressive to look at.

197,Alison P.,"Portland, OR",115,34,,2.0,2012-11-06,"This was my first time at BJ's and there is a strong possibility it will be my last. Here's the thing: The food was fine. Our server was incredibly nice. The biggest issue? They smother the hell out of you the second you walk through the door. I went with my Mom, and were greeted by the hostess, who seemed to be counting down the hours until her shift was finished. She sat us, and then proceeded to ramble a speech at us, telling us about some sort of seasonal beer. Honestly, I felt bad for her. I've had to do the awkward ""I had to memorize this shpeal even though I really have no idea what I'm saying"" thing before, but at least make it personable. Don't talk at me like a robot then say ""anyquestionsnokenjoy"" in one breath and walk away. Anywho, there was that. Literally not a minute later, our server comes up. And guess what. There's another shpeal. Luckily, he had some pep to his step and didn't drag it out, so that was good. He leaves. Maybe two minutes later...he's back. Takes our drink order. Finally, I get a minute to breathe and take a look at the menu. He delivers our drinks, and gives us  little more time. We order, everything is grand. Server brings us our food. Not even a full bite into the meal, he comes and asks how everything is. I awkwardly, nod, with my mouth full of salad, and give a thumbs up. About 10 minutes later...HE'S BACK. Asking if we want dessert. My mom and I give him a weird look, and he explains that their signature dessert takes about 20 minutes to make, and they like to ask mid-meal so you don't ask for it afterwards and have to wait for it. We politely decline, and get back to our meal. I get it. It's not really their fault. BJ's is training them to do this...whatever. Our waiter was very nice, and just doing his job. But it drove me batty to have to stop, mid conversation 4 or 5 times, to get rambled at about some shitty pumpkin beer that I'm not going to try.

The wait was about 25 minutes for a family of 4, which can be hard to do when you have a little one that wants to run all over the place. So by the time we were finally seated she was pretty much over it. Although, I did hear people say that they had reservations and they were seated right away. And some of them were just partys of 2. So I think if we go back we will just do that! This was a spontaneous trip, so there wasn't time for a reservation. The food was good, the beer was ok. The atmosphere was nice. The wood floors were terribly dangerous with the highchairs though. Our daughter is onyl 9 months old and was able to scoot her high chair all over the place on the slippery wood floor. You could see all of the parents were having problems with that too. Obviously they need to buy dinfferent high chairs or put non skid pads on the bottom or something. VERY DANGEROUS.

Otherwise, they have a huge menu that's kind of overwhelming. While I'm sure they don't do everything great  - as previously mentioned - I like the roast beef and the pizzas are deep dish delicious.  I've only tried the IPA - good - and they have a lot of local brews on tap. Happy hour has half price pizzas, $2 off appetizers and drink specials as well. Thank God,a  full happy hour which seems less common these days.  Service is very corporate - can I get you a (specific appetizer)? A (specific BJ brew)? A Pizookie?

Had to flag down the hostess to get us a server after we waited 30 mins to get in a drink order.

She returned it to the bar herself and the bartender said, 'Oh, I totally spaced how to make a Manhattan.' (Um, it has TWO ingredients!!) Note to servers- always ask if its a Manhattan on the rocks, or neat. Anyway, she finally got the right drink and our food came. The food was good, but by that time we were so hungry anything would have.  It's a big box chain restaurant.  It's noisy, and tonight it was packed. Why, I dunno.

The service is just as important in the dining experience, and when this place gets packed the service gets pretty awful. Our server wasn't a bad guy, just overworked. But when it takes 20 minutes to get the drinks, another 10 for them to say they are out of the app we ordered, and another 10 for the food... not cool. I'm hoping they'll work out the kinks as they get used to the volume of guests. On to the better stuff. I'm not a deep dish fan (my husband however orders the great white every time), and I was pleased to see ""regular"" crust pizzas and flatbreads. I'm on the veggie flatbread with goat cheese right now, which is $2 off at HH because it's technically an appetizer. I like their pasta, but it can be a little low on flavor sometimes, ordering it with blackened chicken helps though. The sandwiches I've tried are also pretty good. The beers are good: the blonde, hef, berry burst cider (really sweet if you're into that kind of thing), jeremiah red are all good. Usually the seasonal ale is a winner as well.

We were seated by 7:15 amongst a row of small ""for two"" tables with one long communal booth seat and chairs on the aisle side.  Our first impression: We feel crammed in like sardines, and man, is it loud in here.  My elbows on each side were perhaps eighteen inches from neighbors.  Being not-terribly-into close crowds, we ALMOST left without eating but decided to stick it out.   Thankfully, the ambient noise level was so loud that with the exception of a highly curious 10 year old just off my left shoulder most of our conversation remained private.  But I could still easily make out most of the conversations of the two neighboring guests.  Eventually the 10 year old and her family vacated, only to be replaced with a 6 year old who insisted on bouncing on the (one very long) booth seat while playing his pocket-sized video game console. Wife N. started with a salad wedge, a quarter head of iceberg lettuce with a substantial helping of blue cheese dressing and crumbles, bacon, and (normally)  tomatoes and onions which she opted against.  Frankly it was pretty good--I mean good for an otherwise nondescript wedge of iceberg.  The bacon was mapl-y sweet and married quite well with the tang of the bleu cheese and dressing.  Honestly, really good as far as wedge salads go. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and Wife N. ordered the French Dip.  Along with the meal, we ordered an 8-beer sampler (eight 5-oz pours).  You can pick from a selection of about 11 brews and a berry-apple cider. About 15 minutes later, the meal arrived.  Beer was nowhere in sight.  It arrived about 5 minutes after the food.  Okay, no big deal.   The food was quite good.  The chicken was ""food safety police"" done (which I maintain is about 10-15 degrees more cooked than necessary) but it still was tender, flavorful and relatively juicy.  The sauce was as good as we make at home.  The chicken was accompanied by mushrooms, steamed green beans and served atop fettuccini pasta.  The veggies were hot, but still crisp.  Nicely done.  The French Dip was very flavorful--the beef was tasty and the garlicky bread it was served on gave it a lovely kick.  On the side was creamy horseradish which Wife N doesn't eat but I gladly applied to the bite or two I consumed. The beers were honestly a nice surprise.  I realize BJ's is a pretty big ""chain"", but for a chain, their beers were pretty good.  Their ruby-tinged cider had a berry twist to it and for those that like lighter-alcohol fizzy drinks on the sweeter side, this one was VERY nice.  Their hefeweizen had an oddly-floral nose to it that initially was a bit weird but we wound up liking it by the second sip.  Other beers we tried included their Porter, their Stout, a Red, and a Nut Brown.  All were pretty good--some were better than competitors'.   This restaurant has been open around a month.  So it's understandable that the service is still a little scattered.  On the whole, I'd say ""A-Ok"".  If it was just about the food and price/value, I'd be saying 4*s.  But the service was 3*s, and with getting crammed in like a sardine, 2*s, we have an averaged 3*'s rating, good enough to return in perhaps a month or two once they get the kinks ironed out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=220,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

Both my brother and father's skinny fries were cold and since our waiter was next to impossible to get they didn't complain because who knew how long it would be for replacements.

270,Forrest N.,"Beaverton, OR",0,2,,4.0,2012-12-04,"Took my wife and 4-month old to BJ's last night - Monday - which was our first visit to this or any BJ's Brewhouse.  I was a bit worried that we would have to wait for a table as it was crowded, but after being told it would be 15 minutes, a second hostess came up and sat us down in the bar area immediately.   First impressions:  Outstanding layout and design.  The bar area is sleek and I really like the way the lighting hits off the bottles.  The flat panel TVs are visible to all and are really sharp, making this an excellent alternative to watch games over other restaurants.  Despite the fact that there were very few empty tables, the crowd noise was not over bearing and I was able to have a conversation with my wife without having to yell.   Service:  Eliza came to our table right away and walked us through their extensive menu, which she jokingly referred to as 'enormous'.  It is, but I enjoyed her sense of humor about it.  Since we were in the bar area and it was happy hour, she made sure to point out all the deals and specials they had going on, including half off their mini-pizzas.  She was also very knowledgeable about their beer selections and when I asked about their hefeweizen, told me it has a 'heavy hint of banana' and allowed me to taste it before ordering one.  I opted for an IPA which was much better.  Eliza was spot on all night long, let us take our time looking over the menu, answered all questions quickly and well and was very complimentary towards our little daughter, putting as at ease and earning every penny of her tip. Food:  We ordered fried mozzarella to start since apps were $2 off.  They were devoured quickly.  My wife ordered a blackened salmon Caesar and left nothing on the plate.  She is very picky when it comes to salmon (and salads) so when I see an empty platter, I know she enjoyed her meal.  She also had a glass of Malbec, which she said was excellent.  Eliza encouraged me to get their jalapeno burger and I'm glad she did.  It was delicious.  Shoe-string fries were served with it and they were okay, nothing terrific.  I probably would go for wedge fries or a salad next time.  We were presented with a dessert menu and Eliza let us know about their house specialty.  Sadly, we were full and will have to consider another time. Conclusion:  Four stars with ease as the west side of Portland is absent many great options for dinner.  We live in Beaverton, so this is a bit of a hike in the evening, but well worth it.  I would love to try some other beer selections - perhaps a sampler - as well as their pizzas, so we will be back.  The atmosphere and ambiance are both tremendous, our service was impeccable and the food was outstanding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=200,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.512,3.4400000000000004

We are sat quickly, kind hostess, clean establishment, nice comfy booth.

Our food comes in an expected amount of time, not real fast, but not too long. Everything looked great. Everything tasted fantastic. We all got pizzas and they were yum! The crust was perfect and they were not soggy what-so-ever. Crispy and filled with flavor. The personal size was perfect for one person. Drinks were refilled quickly. We were checked on enough. All was going well, so we went for dessert. We all tried a different flavor of Pazooki (SP?). A warm cookie right out of the oven with a big scoop of ice cream on top. I recommend the red velvet.

302,Brian I.,"West Linn, OR",62,256,33.0,3.0,2013-01-03,"So... BJ's.  I was ambivalent when I saw the building going up and signs announcing their impending arrival.  My thought was... ""this chain is still around?"".  There was one at like... 9th & Weidler in NE that we used to visit semi-frequently when we lived nearby.  It was A-OK in Yelp terms.  I've been to this BJ's, and guess what? A-OK. The place is big.  Seriously big.  It's almost a remnant from a time that has seen it's heyday expire: giant footprint (and corresponding overhead) that packs 'em in and gets 'em out efficiently in order to maximize revenue.  The entrance houses a desk and host types along with a foyer for waiting.  Trust me, if you go during prime dinner hours you're gonna wait.  The place is busy.  To the left (facing inside standing in the foyer) is the bar, straight ahead and to the right is the restaurant.  Lots of activity.  The interior is tastefully done and not intrusive.  No ""flair"" like trinkets on the wall that you'll see at Chili's (R.I.P.) or Friday's (also R.I.P.).  Just subtle lighting and subdued colors.  I like this.  The bar area is fine.  The (non-booth) seating looks a bit cramped, but I can't confirm or deny this, because it was completely full while we were there.  So, we stood.  No biggie.  I had a pint of BJ's brown ale, and it wasn't shabby!  One difference (improvement) between this iteration of BJ's and the store that we frequented on Weidler: the new version doesn't limit themselves to BJ's beers only.  They have a wide, wide selection of beer, including Mac & Jack's (always a bonus). Eventually our buzzer went off and we were seated in the dining room.  Small 2 person booth (which was perfectly fine).  The servers are all bright eyed and bushy tailed and obviously freshly trained up through BJ's corporate procedures.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  We had some chips and salsa (A-OK), wife had some kinda salad (A-OK) and I had a basic burger (A-OK).  I'm reading that their pizza is better than average, so I will commit to trying that next.  Yes, there will be a next time.  We had intended to use a gift card that we received, but there was nothing on the card when we attempted to redeem it.  Our server admitted there had been a ""glitch"" with the gift cards when they initially opened, and several cards went out with no $ amounts on them.  Be warned.  They're good about getting the proper amount loaded, provided you can show some kinda proof that you purchased it initially. I had a pizookie.  Once.  No need to have another.  If you're HUGE into dessert, then sure, go ahead and splurge.  I'm not, and don't need it again.  I will check out BJ's again sometime though, for sure.  Gotta see how the pizza is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=260,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.604,3.0800000000000005

I can't categorize what BJs is... but it reminded me of Cheesecake Factory, but slightly more casual, and with more selections of beer. The menu was just as extensive with TONS of options. I ordered a deluxe burger with thin-cut fries (SO GOOD!) and a 3'' red velvet pizzokie (NOMS). I really liked the thick cut versus thin cut fries option, and I am a huge fan of shoestring fries... so BJs -- hats off. Also, pizookies are $5.95 where some proceeds go to charity. How sweet!

They were still training their staff and were really busy, so I gave them a pass for a very ho-hum experience.  But there's no excuse this second time around. We had one person come over and tell us she'd be our waitress. Then another person came by and started taking drink orders. We told her we were ready to order food too, so she started taking those orders. Then the original person came over and helped out with taking food orders (we had a party of 9). A third person delivered all of our drinks and didn't know who ordered what. A fourth person delivered the soup, and he didn't know who ordered them and in which sizes. He also didn't bring soup spoons. The salads came out and we had to wait a bit for the dressing to be delivered. No one came by the whole time we were eating to see how the food was. Water was refilled once across the hour plus we were there. I had unlimited soup and salad. I knew that it would take them a while to bring out refills, so I ordered more soup and salad while I was still finishing my first batch. It still took them 10 minutes after I finished to bring out the refills.  Basically, the service was pretty pathetic. The food was fine. I would go here again just because it's close to work and the lunch prices are pretty decent, but I'll know to expect poor service.

The menu is enormous.  Robert Irvine would have a fit. There is no way some of that stuff isn't frozen. They have everything from pizza to pork chops to soup to salads to burgers to fish to pasta. It was like a book. Too much to take in.  Hubby had a club sandwich, said it was not special, it cost more than $10 which he was surprised by.  It came on parmesan grilled bread with lettuce, tomato and bacon, no cheese, no ham, with mustard. He liked the mustard. Also he did  like the crispy perfect skinny fries.He had iced tea and it was fine. Princess had her desired dip.It arrived in a little bowl with a big plate of tortilla chips. There were a couple fries mixed in with her chips. She was happy and called it ""my precious"", clutching the bowl with her little mitts,  when we tried to swipe some. It also cost about $10. She had a kid's root beer. They make their own, and it was decent.  She eschewed the kid's menu, but I noticed they had a nice one with lots of choices between $5-6.  I decided on a turkey burger. It arrived on a wheaty bun with avocado, swiss cheese, a few mushrooms,  lettuce and tomato and a sauce of some kind  on the side in a little bowl. I got the wedge fries, they were seasoned nicely and crispy also ( I think they had a batter on them). My burger was really pretty tasty, also about $10. I had iced tea, too. Really this was not a bad experience in any way, and I think it's especially good for people who are non adventurous and need American food. We skipped dessert but saw plenty of  people with the inevitable ""pizookie"" that is the BJ's trademark.  Of note, a guy next to us had a beer sampler with four beers in good sized glasses, twice the size of a usual sampler glass. Hubby thought that looked good. They do have lots of beer choices and a nice cocktail menu as well. They also have ""snacks"" priced around $3-5 to have with drinks. I'd totally do that.

They're out on Cornell Road just east of Intel, so it was a bit of a process to see the place built.   If you've never seen one of these, it's a veritable palace; a house of worship to what boils down to homemade beer.  (I'm told the beer is good.  I don't drink beer, so I'll cheerfully admit that this part is lost on me). I'll talk instead about the food. On entry, you notice how *big* this place really is - several thousand square feet; stone floors and high ceilings - and loud, loud music. We showed up, my customer and I, at opening-time on a Friday.  Even though there was no one in the bar and the place looked like an empty cavern, it took about ten minutes for the staff to get around to finding us (I'll give 'em this; the place is new, and they're likely all still getting used to working in something that reminded me of a converted aircraft-hangar). My customer ordered the club sandwich; I ordered their 'California Chicken Sandwich'.  We both had iced tea to drink, which didn't seem to make the waitperson happy.  I learned why when the food arrived. Both sandwiches had oil-grilled bread, which gave them an overall greasy-feel; the fries were pre-frozen (not fresh), and I'm convinced that no one in the kitchen had ever heard of salt or pepper (no seasoning or flavor to either sandwich (in retrospect, I'm glad I ordered the extra bacon for my 'California Chicken', or it would have tasted like something my Grandmother would've made in the early '60's).  My friend's sandwich had far too much bread - and was big enough to feed two people.   It was, also, equally greasy and flavorless. Then it hit me.   This place is a brew-pub-of-sorts.  Their main product is BEER.  The food is intended to be a vehicle for BEER.  It's intended to buffer the stomach with plenty of grease and bread-products; they're low on seasoning to prevent the upset of same (or, in the worst-case, to prevent it from tasting bad when it all comes back up in the parking-lot after drinking too much - wait for it - BEER). I'm giving them two stars because I'm being charitable - they've been open less than a month, and the service might get better. They only get one star for the food, though, and that won't change. Recommendation:   If you're only looking for something to stuff down your gullet as a buffer for copious amounts of their beer, go ahead on.  Don't go there if you want decent FOOD, however - there are other places for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=180,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.568,2.68
188,Ed J.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,63,5.0,1.0,2013-02-12,"Unimpressed.  After hearing all the hype and excitement while waiting for this place to open, I have to ask everyone....  Why?   I have been here 3 times now and came away disappointed each time.    My first experience was at lunch.  We had at least 3 different people waiting on us and none of them were fast, attentive, or even knew much about the menu.  They did, however, know a lot about their rewards program and proceeded to pitch it to us every 5 minutes throughout our meal.  I had the cajun pasta and immediately wished I had eaten in my work cafeteria instead.  The pasta was luke warm and consisted of sauce and chicken poured over a ball of pasta..which, at some point in it's life, had probably been a pile of individual noodles before hardening into the lump I was served. Trip number 2 was for appetizers, dinner, and beer (more on the beer later) while we watched the USC football game.  As a hot wing fanatic I was immediately drawn to their EXXXXXXXXtra Hot wings.  When I asked the server about them he went on to say that they were pretty hot and if I didn't like spicy food I should stick to the traditional or BBQ style.  Right On!!  Challenge accepted!   They must have gotten the order wrong because the wings I ate I would have had no problem serving to my 6 year old daughter.  Of all the adjectives I could use to describe them, ""hot"" isn't one of them.  The wings themselves were fairly poor quality pieces and I think I left roughly half of them uneaten.  Coming from a guy that has no problem packing away 20 plus wings during a football game, that's saying something.  Oh yeah.  Football.  They didn't have the game on.  In fact, they were unable to get ANY PAC-12 football games that weren't shown on national TV.   An Oregon sports bar that doesn't get PAC-12 football.  Good thinking. Trip 3 was just the other day.  I ordered the chicken fried steak.  Now, I have lived in or visited a lot of places across the US.  I have had chicken fried steak in the North, West, South, and Eastern parts of the US.  In every instance, gravy covering the breaded meat is a common theme.  Heck, even Denny's covers theirs with gravy.   Not BJ's.  Apparently country style gravy is a hard to come by commodity within the BJ's universe.  I got 2 large and heavily breaded pieces of shoe leather..i mean ""steaks"", with roughly a tablespoon of gravy  dribbled on the top.  I asked the waiter if I could get an additional side of gravy and was brought roughly another tablespoon.  Well, at least there was enough gravy to use for my small dollop of mashed potatoes. Now about Da Beers.   BJ's ""brew house"" is a name.  What it should be called is,"" BJ's massed produced mediocre beers"".  A place like this may be a marvel of sorts to the beer drinkers of places like Pawhuska, Oklahoma or similar podunk areas where anything other than Budweiser is a rare treat, but  In the PNW where we have such a large variety of GOOD craft beer makers and brew pubs,  it is an insult to everyone else that makes beer around here to call this place a ""brew house"".  We had a 6 beer sampler of which 3 were undrinkable.  Mind you my only criteria for beer is that it is cold....and yet, i let those 3 sit.  Of the beers that actually taste decent, I can't say anything remarkable about them or find a compelling reason why someone should make a trip specifically to taste them. I'm pretty patient and willing to give most places the benefit of the doubt before just writing them off completely.  I think I have a pretty good idea of what to expect from BJ's after 3 trips in their resturant and don't see myself ever stepping foot in their door again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=240,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.5000000000000004,2.6

I ordered off the 540 menu which is the light fare and had the Thai chicken salad which was okay but I decided not to have it again as it was just kind of bland. The second time I tried a Southwestern salad which was made to my specifications (no cheese or tortilla strips) and was fresh and delicious. I got the dressing on the side so it was just right for me. My friend had the Mahi and really enjoyed that.

228,JP S.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,1.0,1.0,2013-04-15,"Warning: This will be a long one! I have never been soooo disappointed in a restaurant in a great while, but BJ's Hillsboro takes the cake! We were there last night and I can honestly say it was THE WORST dining experience I've had in recent history. My husband and I arrived there at 6:55 and only had to wait to be seated for a couple of minutes. We were still waiting for 3 people so we didn't mind the wait. A waiter appeared appeared after 5 minutes and asked us for drinks and appetizers so we ordered a diet coke and the house brewed root beer with the lettuce wraps and calamari. This was around 7:05, the rest of our party came at around 7:20, none of our drinks nor the appetizers have made an appearance yet. We waited for the waiter to appear to take our friend's drink orders but he didn't approach our table until it was 7:30- 7:35 with mine and my husband's drinks, by that time we all knew what we wanted so we made our orders. My husband ordered the 12 oz. rib eye medium rare, I ordered the grilled pork chops, our friends ordered miso salmon, chicken salad and the BJ cheeseburger without pickles and tomatoes. The waiter took our order and then began the longest wait EVER!!! Our friends drinks came at around 8:00, but still no sign of our appetizers. The glass that the orange cream soda came in was filthy, we had to ask for another. Oh and the cutlery had sooo much spots that I was tempted to ask for replacement but we just wiped them with our serviettes. By 8:15 the appetizers finally came. By this time, the whole table were pretty much pissed off. It took an hour for the appetizers to come, I mean seriously did they have to catch the squid themselves??? By 830 our orders still have not come and when we asked the waiter what was taking so long he responded by saying that he too, was wondering why our table was still empty! Really??? We wanted to walk out already. My friend ordered a salad, how long does it take to make it? He came back a few minutes later with our orders, the 12 oz rib eye was supposed to be medium rare but it looked like it had been sitting on the warmer for too long as the steam veggies and rice looked like they've seen better days and the steak was definitely NOT medium rare, the mashed potato on my grilled pork chops was so dry and the knife was so hot like it was placed on a warmer. The chicken salad's lettuce were all WILTED like it was made first and then just left sitting out. The cheese burger had 5 pieces of pickles when it was specifically requested to be taken out. The miso salmon was still not there and the waiter said it was delivered to the wrong table. it was already 9pm at this time. We were seriously annoyed already and we were about to cancel his miso salmon when the manager came and said there had been a mix-up in the back and that the order will be comped because of the delay. Like it would cover up the fact that we have been there for two hours already! WORST service EVER!!! Will definitely NOT be coming back for so-so food that I can get at other places where I don't have to wait for hours for my food to come!!! AWFUL! AWFUL!

This is the second time we've eaten here; we came back after last time to see if the service had gotten better... It hasn't.  Our waitress was nice, but had to apologize multiple times for forgetting things.

She said, ""Yes, that would help! I'll bring it right out."" 10 minutes later, as she walked past our table, she exclaimed ""Oh!"" when she saw that I was now eating the croutons with my fingers. She brought the silverware out 4 minutes later.  By this time, we were out of drinks, and had to ask the waiter who brought out our food for a refill. He told our waitress that we needed a refill and she said, ""They're on their way out!"". Our refills arrived 5 minutes later.

There used to be a location in Lloyd Center area, and I have also been to the one in Jantzen Beach several times.  I would drive across town from Beaverton for their pizza and pizzookie.  But unfortunately, they have changed their pizza crust.  It used to be one of the best deep dish pizzas you could eat (spoken as an Oregonian who has never actually had Chicago style pizza in Chicago) from a chain restaurant.  However, now the pizza, which used to come in the pan and was thick, buttery, and delicious, now comes on a plate and should not really be considered Chicago-style or deep dish at all.  So disappointing.  I know it's not the fault of this location specifically, since it's a chain, but I was so excited there was going to be one close by, and now I am more prone to go to Old Chicago right down the road, which was there all along, if I want good deep dish pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=300,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7960000000000003,3.0400000000000005

He asked who wanted the meat pizza and when we all didn't raise our hands immediately he shrugged his shoulders, said something under his breath and walked off.

Their pizzas looked good from what I saw, and I should have just gotten one, but wanted something different.  I got a side salad, which was just a bagged iceberg mix; that in itself is so cheap and un-classy.  How hard is it to chop some romaine and leafy green lettuce for a salad, or actually chop fresh carrots, etc?  I ordered the open face pot roast sandwich.  The description sounded really good; it had their white cheddar mashed potatoes on top of garlic bread with the meat and all slathered with gravy.  The flavor of the gravy and whatnot was good...but, the bread was super dry and tasted like it was two weeks old.  The potatoes were nicely flavored, but a bit gummy, so had obviously been left in the mixer much too long.  And the meat, what there was of it, was at least half fat that I had to spit out.  The meat I tasted was very tender and flavorful, but there was like, maybe 3 oz of it, tops.  The waitress felt bad and said she would have brought me something else if I'd said something; I would have said something had she come by our table even once after we were served to ask how it was.  But once I was done, what's the point?  I'm not the type to make a big stink.  She was nice, but once we were served, as I said, we didn't see her at all until I moved my plate to the corner of the table and was obviously done.  Even then she asked if we wanted a box, didn't ask how it was.  Oy.  Go to the Border's next door instead.  The rootbeer was the best part of the meal, which isn't saying much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=300,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.7920000000000007,2.84

140,C. A.,"Beaverton, OR",0,11,1.0,3.0,2013-08-04,"Tonight was my third visit to BJ's. Each time, the food has been good -- a step up from pub grub at McMenamin's. Service has always been kind of slow.  Tonight, four of us were dining. As usual, the greeters and all the staff are very nice and friendly. They're just sort of. . . scattered. Two of our party had arrived early and already had drinks. We remaining two ordered beers -- and the wait began. It really can't take 15 minutes to draw a beer, can it? Still, it was okay, because we were enjoying the conversation. Server came back with the beers and asked if we were ready to order. One lady in the party ordered and he then turned to the gentleman opposite here (we were at a 4-top) to take his order. He politely indicated that the server should take my order next (ladies first still applies in restaurant service, folks!). All apps and main courses ordered, we enjoyed our drinks and conversation -- for a long time. Oh, and when he left after taking our order, he did not pick up the menus. I know that's a small thing, but really, those menus are BIG and take up a lot of room. It was awkward to have them there. He came back at one point to bring us waters (we had to ask for those twice) and still didn't take the menus. We finally flagged down another server and asked him to take them away, which he did. Finally another server appeared with one salad. The other three apps were nowhere in sight. She set it down in front of the gentleman and left. We proceeded to wait some more. Had to have been at least five minutes before the other three apps arrived. Is it really that hard? Make the three hot apps and THEN make the salad and take it all out together. Hmmm... Apps happily consumed, we waited some more. Someone came by and took two of the four app plates away -- and disappeared. The other two were left on the table until our meals came out. Awkward #2. When our meals did arrive, one in our party discovered that her Thai Chicken Salad was missing the chicken. Hmm... Server came back to ask if all was well, and she pointed it out. To his credit, he immediately went to the kitchen and returned fairly promptly with a nice plate of sliced chicken for her salad. Seems whoever is doing quality control in the kitchen messed up on that one! At the end of the meal, two of us decided to share a Pizookie as we had never had one. The guys were too stuffed, so we got to enjoy it on our own. When the server took the order, he again took two plates away and left the remaining two, which weren't whisked off the table until the dessert arrived. BTW, the Pizookie is good, but splitting it was absolutely the right thing to do. Very rich! All in all, the food is very good -- probably no Michelin stars or anything, but better than most pub food. I perused the menu online so that helped -- the thing is huge! It could take a long time to decide what to order if you'd never seen it before.  Service and expediting and quality control have issues. Everyone is nice, which makes up for a lot, but the inconsistencies are glaring. There are lots of servers running around -- there were four clustered around a computer terminal for quite a while -- but they just don't seem very organized in how they do things. Does the main server bus tables, too? I don't know. If there are designated bus persons, they need to do a better job. If the server is supposed to do that, then some further training needs to happen. And timing and quality checks in the kitchen need to be addressed, too. It's just awkward to have one person get a salad and then stare at it and the other three dinner companions for five minutes or more before the rest of the appetizers arrive. I'll be back, but only when I know I have time to relax and not stress about how much time I'm taking for a meal. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=180,2.68,2.68,2.68,3.1160000000000005,2.68

I arrived with a group of 6 friends, was seated quickly and given our drinks.  Unfortunately that's when the problems began.  When they brought out our entrees everyone was given theirs except me.  I was told mine would be out shortly, but as a few minutes dragged into 10 minutes I was starting to get annoyed.  I saw awkwardly watching half of my friends eating their food and the other half letting their food get cold because they didn't want to eat until everyone was served.  One friend ordered a salad that was missing the chicken and got her chicken replaced way quicker than my entree was brought out.  A decent thing to do would have been to offer me something to eat while I waited for my meal, but at BJ's I really think they just don't care. Despite all the problems we decided to order dessert.  Our waiter took our orders than walked away before our final person got a chance to order hers.  We didn't see him again for a while so my friend didn't even bother trying to order her dessert at that point.  When they brought the desserts out yet again, he brought everyone's dessert except mine.  I only had a to wait a couple minutes this time, but I was perturbed that it happened not once but twice in the same trip.  Our waiter did nothing to try and better the situation. I went home and wrote a letter to the manager letting him know how our meal went and that it was unacceptable.  I had hoped I would get some sort or response or apology, but that would be asking too much of them.  If you care at all about good service and having an enjoyable experience, then stay away from here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=280,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.8520000000000003,2.64

The items on the menu are like the items that appear in your side mirror on your car; larger than they really are.  The beet salad was over $5; but only had $2.00 worth of food on it.  Yeah, it came on a long white plate, very fancy, but the amount of food for what they charged was just stupid.  Then the main course came and everything, and I do mean everything had a ton of pepper on it!  Oh yeah, I am a pepper fan, but if I wanted my food blackened, I'd have ordered it that way.  The steak was so tough and peppery, I didn't finish it and I didn't take it home.  The side veggies I chose were asparagus and the horseradish potatoes.  The asparagus came so over cooked as to be black...black asparagus...dried out...with pepper covering every centimeter.  I couldn't even eat it.  My sister ordered the brussel sprouts and they were so over cooked and nasty, she just pushed them to the side.  Now, I grew up eating good food; my mom was a superior cook - studied at the French cooking school in New York...we know good food.  This wasn't it. We called the waitress over and told her the veggies were nasty and she asked if she could bring us out new veggies.  I said, ""why aren't they going to be just like these?""  [Yes, I tend to be sarcastic when you mess with my money...this food costs plenty of money.]  She brought the manager over, who immediately started to defend the way they cook things.  The brussel sprouts are made in the morning, because they only have one oven.  [What?  Yeah, he said one oven.]  So they sit under heat lamps all day long...same with the asparagus.  That's great!  So tasty!  For those of you who don't eat either veggie; they only take about 5-7 minutes to cook and you can do that while you're burning your steak with pepper!  You don't need to make a bunch in the morning; you can, if you know how, cook them to order when the food is ordered.  Even if your kitchen staff is small.   The manager did offer to get us ""naked"" asparagus without seasoning and he told us we could have ordered it that way.  Really?  How come the waitress didn't tell us that?  She didn't tell us because as she admitted later, she didn't know we could do that...there's no button on the machine that tells her we can order naked anything.  The only reason we left her any tip at all was because my sister felt sorry for her.  It was obvious she was out of her league; had no imagination herself, and had absolutely no individual authority to create a decent dining experience for her customer. So, the steak was pepper burned; the ribs my sister ordered were over cooked; [go to the Albertsons on 25th in Hillsboro for really good ribs.  The guy there knows what he's cooking!]  we left disappointed with yet another chain restaurant; and won't be going back there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=180,3.08,3.03,3.03,2.5320000000000005,3.05
242,Sean A.,"Portland, OR",58,155,61.0,4.0,2014-08-02,"A pleasant surprise indeed.  We hated going to our local one in our old city simply because it was so popular the wait times for dinners rarely were less than 45 minutes.   Here we didn't wait at all.  Greeted promptly, sat immediately, even with a rather busy floor.  Server was at our table within a short time to greet and get drinks going (as well as an app).  My wife and I were VERY happy to see a starter salad that was on a trial a year ago had made it to full time status.  The Mixed greens with watermelon, mint, honey vinaigrette, and feta.  If you enjoy a light salad with lots of flavor, you really should try it.  I have duplicated this at home because we enjoyed it so much (and didn't want to ever deal with the ludicrous wait).   We also had calamari, which wasnt bad, but several larger pieces were not separated making it more like eating a while deep fried squid.  I didnt mind ripping it apart a little, but this is a higher end restaurant folks. My wife ordered a parmesan crusted chicken with a fantastic lemon butter sauce (the other ingredient escapes me but it was well paired), sun dried tomatoes, and white cheddar mashed potatoes.  Well executed and awesome flavors.  this is a winner for sure. I had a balsamic glazed grilled chicken breast with fried onion straws, and carmelized onions (why 2 onions I have no idea) paired with white cheddar mashed as well.  The chicken was great.  The balsamic reduction with the onion straws and mashed were an amazing combo.  Notice I haven't mentioned the caramelized onions.  Well.  Sadly, myne were hardly caramelized.  More like lightly sautéed/steamed in a large batch to prepare for service.  They were soggy (i know caramelized should be on the soggy side, but see the steamed comment and you get what i mean) and didnt taste right at all.  So they didnt get eaten.  Maybe if those were done properly they might have added something to the dish, but in my case, they were a waste of product and cooks time. The whole family had their signature Pazookies, each of us had something different.  My wife and i each tried their new creations.  A peanut butter smore  cookie creation, and a salted caramel cookie creation.  I ate my salted caramel totally.  Awesome pick, i hope they keep this one.  The PB smore.  While good.  It was super rich, and some may like it, but i think a person would have to split it to keep from going into a diabetic coma.  It was very good as well, wife and kids loved it, but a bit too rich for me LOL.

After looking over the menu and talking for about 15 minutes, we realized we had not been greeted or asked for a drink order. As a matter of fact, no one was even paying attention to us at all. Having had this type of experience before at other restaurants, we decided to leave and go somewhere else. As we left the receptionist said ""Thank you"" and we remarked, ""Thank you for what? No one ever took our order."" As we started walking toward our car a server(later we learned her name was Denise) came after us and begged us to come back inside. She apologized, profusely, and said she wanted to pay for our lunch to show us that the restaurant really wanted our business. After some discussion we came back inside. She then became our server and everything went great. The manager came over(Josh, I believe) and again apologized and reassured us that we would get exemplar service and food whenever we returned. Denise also brought us a free dessert to share. I told Denise that we really didn't expect them to pay for our meal but she insisted. I had a burger and my wife had shrimp tacos. They were both delicious. I tried their home made root beer and it was amazing! We will definitely patronize this restaurant!

She quickly took his (disgusting) plate away, with a smile, not acting in the least bit grossed out. Then she brought him an entirely new plate of spaghetti (which we were not charged for).

We were expecting it to be busy so my father-in-law called ahead and got a 5 pm reservation for 5 adults and 2 kids. We got there at 5 sharp. It wasn't busy but we still waited for 10 minutes as the hostess couldn't seem to figure out how to do anything. She never greeted us or even acknowledged us. But she did figure out how to seat a few smaller groups that came in after us. Then she comes up and says we can go back and seat ourselves. Ok that's not very professional. We walked back and there wasn't a table set up at all. She was so confused. We were too. She asked us to go back up to the waiting area. After 5 more minutes she said it would be a few minutes. Geez. So the hostess who was working on 08/01/15 at 5pm needs to be severely retrained. Our server was great on the other hand. He was very attentive. Our food was ok except for the $22 rib eye steaks that 3 of us ordered. My father-in-law ordered his medium-well, his was half medium rare and half rare. Still bleeding is a good sign it's not cooked medium-well. I ordered mine medium. One end was rare, it went to medium in the middle and the other end was medium-well. Just weird. Most of the steak was fat so at $22 I felt ripped off. The third steak was also cooked unevenly but not as bad. I will say my clam chowder was excellent and the handcrafted root beer and cream sodas were really good.

Pretty good food with a great selection for a reasonable price, on the higher end of your Applebee's/TGI Friday's-type of something-for-everyone restaurant, where you and your co-workers can discuss tomorrow morning's presentation over a ribeye or a club sandwich and fries. (By the way, I'm not on a business trip. I've been on a few in my day, so I know the kind of place.) I would come here again, for sure. I've had the lunch special stuffed baked potato and salad a few times now, delicious and filling and certainly reasonable at $8.50. The menu is, as others have mentioned, a bit too voluminous and not well-organized, honestly. The first time, I came in at 12:30 pm and it took me a few minutes to find the lunch section.

I went in for dinner with my boyfriend as we had done a few times there, customer service hasn't always been the best but this time it really ticked me off..after waiting forever during a slow mid week late evening we finally got out VERY weak margaritas (literally tasted like a virgin margarita..ick) I ordered the bacon cheese burger with fries and my boyfriend got the same. They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked like most places do and I didn't think to make sure to say well done (never had to before anywhere else) when I got my burger it was very very pink. Now if it was just a little pink I would have been fine but this was REALLY pink, his was not. So I had to send it back and get it cooked again. They didnt make a new burger or fries, they threw my cut in half burger on the grill and brought me back a soggy bun, cold fries, greasy plate. By this time my boyfriend was done eating as it had been around 20 min before I got my good back. So instead of sending it back AGAIN I ate some of it because I was frustrated, hungry and ready to go. I didn't ask for my money back (which I should have that night) but like I said, I was flustered and just wanted to go. So they next day I called to speak with a manager and tell him about my experience and ask for a compensated burger on my next visit. He basically made me feel like a liar and complainer, and told me I should have done something about it that night. I explained how I felt that night and how I just wanted to leave out of frustration. He still did nothing. So, paying 50 dollars for 2 burgers and 2 margaritas you would think I would have had something done about this.

First off, the movie ""Quarantine"" was playing on the big TVs at 7:30 on a Saturday night, which is a particularly gory rated R horror film that beyond not being particularly appetizing, is also not a film that I would want my children to see in a family friendly restaurant. No one seemed to notice this for at least 45 minutes, long past the bloody scene with full frontal nudity.  Moreover, 3 of our 4 dishes came out around 40 minutes after we ordered them, only lukewarm. By the time that the other person in our party got their food we were done eating, which wouldn't have been such a big deal if it was even remotely similar to what she had ordered. They did take her order off the check which we appreciated. Our waitress was incredibly rude about this though, and unprofessionally blamed the kitchen staff even after admitting that she had misheard her order. We also had to ask for silverware three times before we received it, and when we asked for napkins intermittently she pointed us to the cocktail napkins under our beverages instead of providing us with table settings.

26,Elizabeth D.,"Portland, OR",21,107,29.0,1.0,2016-12-15,"BJ's was always a guilty pleasure of mine. Sure, it's a modern version of Applebee's, but their enlightened menu is tasty and great for when I'm on a diet fad. This weekend, my husband and I decided to grab curbside take-out because it was too cold to bother getting dressed. They got our order correct and it was out timely, but it went horribly awry half way though the meal. The major issue with my meal is that we received a rather unexpected Surf N' Turf entree. To clarify, we ordered their crispy jalapeño burger. It included some awesome fixins' like fried jalapeños, Chipotle mayo, and pepper jack. Halfway through the burger, and my husband spit out a goopy pink shrimp. It was inside one of the jalapeño bites. Shrimp makes us both completely sick to our stomach, so meal ruined right there. That's not the big problem though. The problem is in their food prep; I cannot fathom how that shrimp got inside the jalapeño popper in the first place. Either they are storing their food terribly or just not paying attention at all during prep.

Honestly TO MANY CHOICES. The menu was extremely thick and took us about 10-15 minutes to get through. Side note they offer carbonated water with a hint of flavor which was neat and they were bottomless.  I ordered a salad which was like $12.50.. I think it was a little spendy for a salad. When I got the salad the size was fine and they had put a fair amount of chicken on it. Other then that the salad was disappointing. They use iceberg lettuce is a little hint of romaine... I was hoping it would be mostly romaine or something. I didn't really feel like the salad was worth $12.50. Our service was great though.

Not surprisingly they were quite busy.  There was no wait for a table. We did notice quite a large party in their side room.  Our server was very pleasant. She was knowledgeable and even did her due diligence when it came to ""upselling"" and guiding us through the menu. With over 100+ menu items on the menu it can be overwhelming. If not slightly on the ridiculous side. To some people that many items can be overwhelming. Our order was placed quickly and with the new tablets that the servers carry around, it seemed efficiently. She even offered to sign us up for the rewards program.  Our appetisers were delivered by a woman who we assume was a good runner and not a server. She dropped our salsa verde ""queso"" dip on the table with enough force that some of the chips fell off of the plate. I tried to grab her attention and say thank you. But she ignored us and walked away.  We informed the server of our displeasure of the food runners attitude and service. She followed most industry standard protocol. She apologised and asked to rectify it. The food runner did not drop of our entrees.  The food was okay. The bread bowl for the soup was slightly under done.  The roasted chicken and quinoa was made fantastically.  The server did have an issue that was NOT her fault. She had a party of what was ~12 people. Then that same party turned into ~18. I felt sorry that this party now started to consume her. Our drinks laid empty for quite sometime due to this party. Instead of her co-workers helping her out, they walked blindly past and were only concerned with checking their cellphones they tried to keep hidden from management.  When the server finally came back by she apologised for the long interval between checking back. She mad us another round of beverages, and offered the check.  She did offer dessert, none by name.  We waited nearly 10 minutes for the check to be brought to us.  And yes we did time it just to see.  With the tablets that the server was carrying the payment was processed almost instantly. That was a positive since most guests at lunch are in a hurry.  All in all I give it 2 out of 5 stars. The server was great, but was put into a bad position with the party that expanded without notice. The other team members were definitely less than stellar. The food was average. The queso dip was grainy and not very good. It was seemed as if there was a stepped skipped during preparation that made the cheese not melt properly.

Which is saying a lot, because I am very picky with gluten free foods. I will not spend $15.00 on a pizza if I am unsure about the gluten free crust.  ALSO, they have a gluten free pizookie...... They are literally to die for. They only offer gluten free for the chocolate chip cookie option, but it is way way WAY better than anything you have ever tasted.

Not too much salty flavor and tastes like there's nuts in the cookie  Triple chocolate (ghirardelli) - super rich but good!  White chocolate macadamia nut - nope nope nope! Tastes like lemon  Wish they had a snicker doodle flavor.  Staff was extremely friendly, attentive and helpful! Overall I'd give this place 3.75-4/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro,2.6,2.95,3.092,,2.8100000000000005
15,S C.,"Beaverton, OR",0,8,2.0,1.0,2017-11-05,"I used to come here all the time for the convenience (open late, close to my workplace, decent variety of menu items), but after our last encounter, I don't think I'll be back to this location.  My boyfriend and I arrived late in the evening and the place was pretty empty - we asked for a booth and the host said, ""how about at the bar instead?"".  No thank you, a booth please - just a little more personal and not as bright lighting.  He says, ""well why not the bar? You don't have to drink or anything, you just have to sit there.""  We said again, ""no, a booth, please."" The host then waves his arms around and says ""okay, whatever, I'm not going to argue with you""  and proceeds to seat us at the most unnecessarily large booth ever, when there were plenty of little booths open and other couples sitting at them.  Our server later came over and asked us why we were seated there, because the section was supposed to be closed.  We told him that the host seated us here and we felt like he did it just to be a jerk, to be honest (oh, you want a booth so bad? I'll show you a booth! Here's a booth to fit 10 people!).  He apologized profusely and said he would speak to our host.  Normal dinner after that, but honestly absolutely the worst encounter I've ever had at a restaurant - so blatantly rude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro?start=20,2.6,2.95,3.08,,2.8100000000000005

31,Cara B.,"Hillsboro, OR",3,63,13.0,3.0,2017-11-19,"Just over a year later from a bad experience I finally felt ready to give this place a try. I am happy to report that this time the host desk was staffed. We were greeted and seated in a timely fashion.  The place had a very nice laid back feel. Lighting was low and plenty of football games were spattered around the edges of the restaurant. The menu was pretty large, and I ended up ordering the chicken club sandwich with fries.  The food was average chain food. I wouldn't order that item again. The fries were crispy and hot. The service was good. There isn't really anything about the place making me want to run back and eat there again, but it's handy to have a generic place to go when you don't want to decide.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro,2.48,2.89,3.068,,2.726
25,Pamela B.,"Hillsboro, OR",31,14,6.0,3.0,2017-11-22,Brown celery served with Memphis wings.  This restaurant is unpredictable in its food quality.  My last visit I was served something different than what I ordered.   The staff is wonderful.  The beer is enjoyable.  The venue is nice.  I am cheering you on to improve the food standards.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro,2.48,2.87,3.064,,2.7140000000000004
35,Matt V.,"Beaverton, OR",0,14,,3.0,2017-11-30,We stopped by BJ's for a quick dinner.  My wife had the prime rib dip and it really wasn't that great.  The meat didn't really look or taste like prime rib.  It was very overcooked and salty.  I had the chicken melt sandwich and it was really good.  The bread was grilled crispy and the avocado was fresh.  I also enjoyed my peach infused iced tea.  This isn't the first time we've been here and we will be back.  My wife just probably won't order the prime rib dip sandwich again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro,2.44,2.85,3.068,,2.686
29,Gunner J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,39,21.0,1.0,2017-12-08,Hostess was completely unwilling to accommodate our group. There were several open tables that could have worked for us to sit at.... she wasn't very nice and tried to tell us we would have to sit separately or wait over an hour. We were never told why we couldn't easily merge two center tables when the people next to them had done it. Terrible terrible customer experience! I love BJ's but I will NOT be returning to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro,2.4,2.81,3.056,,2.646
33,Mark S.,"Kirkland, WA",0,2,,4.0,2017-12-09,Friendly service and food was better then I expected.  I sat at the bar and it was slightly slower then I expected so I docked the place 1 star but over all it was great.  I recommend the flatbread pizzas!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro,2.52,2.84,3.064,,2.712

I had the jalapeno burger.  The kids ordered some stuff from the kids menu, which had tons of options.  For starters we had the cheese sticks and sprouts.  The cheese sticks were so-so, but I would recommend the sprouts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro,2.68,2.89,3.084,,2.806

I gave them another try and my son's burger was done this time but still greasy. I ordered a wedge salad and that was thrown in a container, breadsticks were good, but my favorite was the couscous Mac n cheese. I don't think I will eat there again though because it's just to expensive for average food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-hillsboro,2.84,2.93,3.084,,2.894
