12,Antonio R.,"Flint, MI",3,13,6.0,1.0,2013-12-05,Worst dining experience I've ever had in my life! I went here on a Friday night and it was packed. Food took forever and my moms food was prepared incorrectly twice. Was comped for the meal and offered a free desert the desert was even Burnt. The manager didn't even come talk to us.. She should be fired and our waiter should be promoted. He did the best he could to keep us happy! Worst ever restaurant in Flint Mi,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
14,Jim B.,"Lapeer, MI",0,2,3.0,5.0,2014-04-12,"Very good experience. Went with Wife and son who is 4. He required special accommodations like a small spoon, smaller bowl that was not hot. Waitress was great and took care of everything without a problem while keeping drinks full and empty plates cleared. Food is always good here. I like the Mexican Mac and cheese and my wife is in love with the margarita pizza. Look forward to returning even if only for apps and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
10,Just A.,"Lansing, MI",0,24,,1.0,2014-12-14,"My wife and I just walked out of this location for a second time, over the exact same issue.  Undercooked burger. It was so undercooked that the bottom bun was soggy and pink from blood. As I said, this is the second time from this location. Beyond Unacceptable",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
8,Jonathan G.,"Flint, MI",1,18,,1.0,2015-11-02,"Definitely the worst service and food around. I refuse to return. Chili's a good place in general, but the one here is just horrible. Servers have no idea or desire to give attentive service, they forget everything and are slow. Food is always poorly prepared and is a constant disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
7,Katie S.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",46,6,1.0,1.0,2015-11-14,"When we first arrived and went to the restroom, one of the toilets was literally overflowing. We ordered an appetizer, no appetizer until we asked, more than 20 min later. Two out of five of our orders were wrong and another had a hair. Oh, and the manager was mopping the floor in the dining area, we are pretty sure it was the same mop he used to clean up the overflowing toilet. The manager never came to the table like we were told he would regarding the hair in one of the entrees. Also, every table within earshot was asking for replacement food or had another issue. My group of five will never be returning to this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
4,Ta'Mika M.,"Mount Morris Township, MI",19,12,7.0,1.0,2015-12-30,"The worse Chili's experience I have ever had. The staff is the awful. They have a ""I don't want to be here attitude"" & they just stand around talking to there friends that are eating in the restaurant & the manager is standing there watching the whole thing. The staff is clearly a reflection of their leader. They don't care because she doesn't care. I will not be coming back to this location. It's a shame that the renovations don't reflect the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
11,Kay R.,"Davison, MI",0,30,,1.0,2016-01-06,"First time I have been at this location and Will NEVER go back. Was there on Sun. Jan. 3,2016 approx 5:30 pm. Had to wait for service ( they where not busy), wait, wait, and wait for our food. I could see in the kitchen and they where doing nothing. When we got our food over 45 minutes later it was horrible!! One of the 4 orders was wrong. Everyone even the so called manager had a very bad attitude. No one there cared if they had a job and serntly wasn't doing it. Will not waste my money here!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
6,Bolder D.,"Swartz Creek, MI",0,12,,2.0,2016-01-08,"Met some friends there at 530 PM on a Thursday night.  The place was rather dead (maybe 5 or 6 others there) for the time of day. We sat down and within 2 minutes the waitress came over to take our drink order.  The 2 women ordered triple berry margaritas, the other gentleman ordered a beer (I an't remember what type) and I was good and had a water.   When the drinks came out about 10 minutes later, the other gentleman's beer was the wrong kind (he was given a Blue Moon) and she sat a coke in front of me.  I told her that I had wanted water and to take the coke back and bring me what I had ordered.  She walked away in a huff and brought back my water about 5 minutes later. As we began to order, we were informed that they didn't have any ribs, my first thought was ""How in the hell do you not have ribs at 1800 on a Thursday?"".  We had to repeat ourselves no less than 3 times so she could write it down and make sure it was written right.  3 of the 4 of us had ordered soup while the 4th had ordered an appetizer of smothered chicken wings. When the soup came out, only 2 was brought, no 3rd and no chicken wings.  I asked about it and she said that that was all that the cook had out for her but she would check on it.  5 minutes later, out came the left behind soup and chicken. The soup was lukewarm and the chicken was cold and rubbery, almost like it had been sitting out for, oh I don't know. 5+ minutes maybe?   When the food came out, it looked good.  I had a bacon cheese burger and fries which was good tasting and at the proper cook (Medium rear).  My wife's plate was hot and she said it was good tasting. The other couples steak was a bit over cooked for them but they ate it and said it was alright. All in all, it was an OK evening.  The food was alright but the waitress is what brought the review down.  If you have good wait staff, they are what will bring customers back.  Get rid of the dead wood, get happy, caring people. Edit to add.  While the waitress was slow and incompetent at almost everything in her job, she was all over the table when we left to get her tip.  Hell, we weren't even out the door and she was looking for the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
13,C T.,"Flint, MI",0,1,,1.0,2016-02-14,"I don't even know where to start. Let me first say that Chili's actually has really good food, and I love that. Unfortunately good food does not make up for the very disappointing service, not once but consistently. From the moment you walk in and you are not greeted by the ""hostess""... You have to approach them, and then you get their attitude. They do not appear to care whether you are there or not. And apparently they do not care, and neither do the waitstaff or the manager. Many of them stand around as if they have nothing better to do than talk to each other. We sat at the bar so wecould actually have a place to sit. While sitting there I counted at least six tables that were empty, not bussed and also not seated. It is really disappointing to know that this is the only Chili's around. The service is horrible, but the food is great. But poor service continuously means that people will not come back. I have tried to be patient and yet every time I am there the service sucks. This is definitely a reflection on the management, because if they really wanted to make this place good, they would get rid of the servers and staff who suck, and replace them with people who actually get paid to do the job they were hired to do. If you don't want to be there, don't be there! We can definitely tell you don't want to be there. So go somewhere else and let someone who cares have your job. And just as a sidenote, When I went to the restroom one of the staff members was in the bathroom the entire time, in front of the mirror, patting her hairand making sure she looked good even though her service sucked. We have given this restaurant ample opportunity to prove themselves, and we are always disappointed. Sorry chilies, we are not a fan of the Flint Michigan restaurant. Perhaps you need to go in and clean house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
3,Lyndsae R.,"Durand, MI",8,4,,1.0,2016-03-30,"What should have been a simple take out order was a mess. I walked in to an almost empty restaurant at 5:30 pm on a Friday to pick up an online takeout order. After being directed to the bar, I approached the bartender and told her that I was there for a pick-up and gave her my name. Without a word, she turned and walked into the back, returning about 6 minutes later. She handed me the receipt and I handed over my debit card. She ran the card, returned with the slip, waited for me to sign it, and took it and walked away. She didn't say a single word to me the entire time! There was no ""one moment please"" or ""here's your order"" or ""sign here"", just silence.  The quality of the food was no better. We ordered two entrees: Spicy Shrimp Tacos (with no avocado) with sides of rice and black beans, and a Choose Three of Chicken Soft Tacos and a Chicken Tostada with rice and salad. We also asked for sides of sour cream and salsa. Nothing complicated, so it should be simple, right? No sir. The shrimp tacos came with avocado and there were no sides of sour cream or salsa. Strangely, we did get an extra side of black beans. (Bonus?) The shrimp tacos were barely filled and some of the container's lids were on tight. I could have eaten better food from a microwaved frozen dinner. Needless to say, I will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
9,Troy K.,"Clio, MI",0,27,,1.0,2016-04-11,"Worst restaurant in the franchise.  I travel all the time.   Unfortunately its the closest to my house.  Do not go here I it closes.  I love chilis. But this one needs a total restart,  waitstaff is terrible,  young bartender totally incompetent.   One server is a worker out of the few I saw today.  Pathetic!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
1,Veronica D.,"Burton, MI",189,180,216.0,1.0,2016-05-04,"Food took forever!! Chicken was cold, no avocado on the tacos. Dirty dishes everywhere, not being picked up. Servers standing around on their phones, and ours disappeared for awhile. Will never return to this location, or probably even a Chili's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
5,David A.,"Fenton, MI",114,16,9.0,1.0,2016-05-05,"Will never be going here again. Took over an hour to recieve an appetizer. After receiving the queso dip it looked and tasted like baby vomit. Waitress went to get manager and it took him 25 minutes to stop over. Ordered 4 Margaritas, they were warm and tasted like sweet and sour mix. We left before the food even came out to us. The manager said ""he would take care of it"" as if after waiting that long and receiving no food we still were going to pay for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
2,Jerry H.,"Flint, MI",18,10,5.0,1.0,2017-01-11,"I'll give that one star and no tip to the waitress my kid touched the tablet on the table and they charged us $2 immediately as much as touched it I told my child but it will cost money to play the game use your phone at the end of eating I get my bill with the $2 table entertainment the this is deceitful and the waitress responsibility to let you know and she did not so she is being punished and says Chili's is deceitful and they shouldn't do that you think 50,000 people come in there a month and then everyone's kid touches that that's $2 per person that's ridiculous",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
0,Samantha S.,"Grand Blanc, MI",90,8,2.0,3.0,2017-10-21,"Thank you, Chaunte at the bar,  for saving our night! Food was very good. But... we were sat at a table and waited nearly 10 mins without being greeted. Watched floor mgr bus tables & even ask server handling next table if she was ok. We moved to the bar without anyone noticing - and later saw another couple leave without being greeted. Chaunte was efficient & professional with a smile- an asset to your team.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flint,,,,,
