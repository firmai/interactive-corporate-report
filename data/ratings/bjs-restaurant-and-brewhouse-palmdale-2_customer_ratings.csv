294,Frank L.,"Lancaster, CA",9,7,8.0,5.0,2012-01-06,"We love BJ's.  They have some good craft beers and the coffee is awesome too. (I guess when you have the ""brewing"" thing down it doesn't matter if it is coffee or beer.) The potstickers are a great, shareable app.  The HUGE stuffed potatoes are good and I have yet to try an item on their menu that I have not enjoyed.

292,Faye V.,"San Francisco, CA",47,59,52.0,3.0,2012-01-10,"My family is a fan of BJ's, even if for the strawberry lemonade and bruschetta alone. We frequent the Elk Grove location and are happy with them. It's a chain that we don't hate -- simply because we like the food options. You've got beers, burgers, pizza and pasta - in all it's good-old-American-fusion glory. If that's what you're looking for, BJ's is definitely as a top pick.  The tricky thing -- the service. It was a-okay here. It was a little bit slow, but not so delayed that we were upset. It was Saturday night after all. The staff was really courteous, and these days, simple kindness goes a long way. A few staples: root beer floats, calamari, wings, bruschetta and nachos for starters. My personal faves: the seafood pasta and Cobb salad. The chowder, pot roast and pork chops score high with the fambam. Everything is large enough to share - including the pizookie. Our group includes two, sometimes 3, toddlers, a man-child, grammy and everyone in between. BJ's has something for everyone, plus Daddy can have a beer while peeking at the game and the babies can be a little loud without anyone really noticing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=280,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7,3.2800000000000002

296,Teri D.,"Quartz Hill, CA",9,28,36.0,4.0,2012-01-28,"Craving deep dish pizza for 2 days so we ordered and picked up from B.J's. Couldn't wait to cut into a good Chicago style deep dish with all that melted cheese and sauce...sounded so good ! What a disappointment. Ordered extra cheese and still had hardly any on it, and what it did have was kinda dry and burnt. And the sauce was non existent. None. Who makes pizza with no sauce??? But whenever we've dined there the other food has been good and service good as well so they still get 3 stars. Just don't order the deep dish bread.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=280,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.8320000000000003,3.3200000000000003
202,Angela K.,"Long Beach, NY",171,241,191.0,4.0,2012-02-01,"I just came here with my mother for an early lunch. At this particular location, I really love the customer service of the bartenders, hosts, and the servers. They really lighten up the mood.  We ordered the lunch specials. My mother ordered the unlimited soup and salad for $6.95 and I ordered the Half Flatbread Pizza and Half Salad for $6.95. Both of these lunch special items are definitely a great deal. Unlimited soup and salad 4 stars ++Salad is like a house salad w/ iceburg lettuce, tomatos, croutons, etc with any choice of dressing. She ordered chicken tortilla for the first round and then a clam chower for the second. Chicken Tortilla is sooo yummy. How they serve the soup is pretty cool too. Order the dish and you will see what I mean. Clam chower was on the salty side so my mother had to pour some hot water to it. It may just be that most people eat their soups salty and we have sensitive tastebuds.... Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza and Salad 5 stars ++I can't believe this is only $6.95 at lunch. The margherita fresca flatbread pizza was soooo freakin good. The salad consisted of mixed green salad with a balsamic vinegrette dressing. Very well put together. Our server was pregnant but she was really good and attentive at her job. She was a trooper in making sure our food was great. Anyways I would definitely come back to BJ again whether it's for a drink, lunch, or dinner. It's definitely a great place to eat, talk and be merry. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=240,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.768,3.4400000000000004

357,Arthur S.,"Long Beach, CA",15,72,3.0,1.0,2012-03-29,I will make this short and to the point I ordered a pizza I wanted half pineapple and half pepperoni.  When I got my bill it charged me for what i ordered but also for tomatoes as a topping.  The pizza did have tomatoes on it but it was never ordered by us.  Instead of just taking the topping off and letting me happily pay and tip they told me that because I split a topping I had to pay for 2 toppings.  I have worked in many pizza places in my day and that is just some bull.  They got the manager and the manager told me the same thing.  Train your people on what customer service is I was a loyal customer but over them charging me for an extra topping I will never visit that branch again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=320,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.5000000000000004,3.3200000000000003

Sometimes the service is pretty slow, and often they put things on the pizzas you didn't order or don't put things on that you do order, but they will always correct the problem happily if you point it out to them.

The service is good, the food is very tasty, and the beer is very refreshing, but my favorite is the mojito. My girl and I made it our mission to try every pizza in the menu(not at once of course), and out favorite is the sweet pig. We start of with the small appetizers like the fried artichokes, or the bruschetta. Too bad they removed the tacos from that menu, we loved those small tacos.

352,Chris B.,"Edwards, CA",0,28,1.0,1.0,2012-06-11,"Had a pretty terrible experience here for lunch...  We ordered the kids food first, which came out promptly, in fact as we were ordering for the rest of the party.  Initial reflections were positive.  After that it was a mess.  After ordering (and asking for spoons for the kids' apple sauce), it was 20 minutes before we were checked in on again... To bring out salads, and still no spoons.  15 minutes after that, soups came out for those that ordered the soup and salad, and those in our party who had ordered sandwiches asked on that status to which the waitress replied ""oh they're plating them now.""  25 minutes later, after everyone had eaten there were still no sandwiches, and the waitress responed ""well the soup and salad are really quick, but we know, they're cooking them now.""  From plating to cooking, then.  Well, it sounds like we were lied to.  Finally 10 minutes later the manager came out to say that he was sorry and that the sandwiches would be free.  Ok, great, so they're doing the right thing at least.  Well 15 minutes after that, the kids are getting restless and still no sandwiches.  Sandwiches. So I guess if they're going to give you something free, you get put to the bottom of the priority list.  Meanwhile, people are hungry and kids are getting even more restless to the point where I finally decide that we're leaving.  As we're beginning to get up, the manager walks out with two sandwiches. Me: It's too late, we have to go. Mgr: Do you want a box? Me: Well, at this point not really, it's kind of too late. Mgr (miffed): Well, um ok.  I uhh was going to give you some courtesy cards. Me: Well you haven't really inspired enough confidence in me to want to come back, now have you?   Mgr (really miffed): *makes several excuses about how the kitchen was busy (restaurant was half full) and the food got sold to another table... huh?* If the management reads this forum, I hope they understand that making excuses doesn't make things better.  At last gave me two gift cards (total $40) to pay for my $34 meal.  The fact that he charged me for this lovely 1.5 hour lunch experience in the first place is a FOUL.  Then he swiped the gift cards and didn't even give me one back for the remaining balance.  Professional.  I guess either he knew he screwed the pooch or he only begrudgingly compensated me $40 (minus $6).  I ultimately don't care because I wouldn't ever go back here, but the actions of the staff and the manager were inexcusable.  The answer is ""I am sorry and I'll make this right.""  My preferred method is to speak softly and carry a small tip in cases like these but when it got beyond ridiculous, I spoke up and got a barrage of excuses and looks like I was trying to scam this restaurant.  Well, I think I'll take my business elsewhere next time.  I heard good things about this Steve Huddleston guy on other reviews, and I don't think it was he who I dealt with today... but I wonder what kind of place he's running if his staff can't execute simple lunch service and treat their guests poorly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=320,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.34,3.6000000000000005

256,Justin A.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,49,4.0,4.0,2012-07-19,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's and it's style of being a gourmet restaurant, pub, and sports bar type of fusion all in one.  I love the great food and the excellent beers that they have, with the Nutty Brewnette being my favorite.  It's a large size restaurant with TVs all over showcasing various sporting events.  Places like that are immediate winners in my book.  The beer list is great and they'll have some good seasonal beers here and there. The food here is the real treat.  Any place that specializes in beer can't slack on appetizers and luckily BJ's got this memo.  The have a large and diverse menu that's filled with an assortment of great appetizers.  I recommend the Piranha Pale Ale Nachos though it's only an appetizer if you have 3 or more people.  It's probably going to be a meal for 1-2 people because of it's size.  A few of my other favorites that I order regularly are the Avocado Egg Rolls, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  In fact, I once order each one of the above mentioned appetizers, including the nachos on a first date.  I tried to impress by taking over and just ordering for us ""like a man"" and I wanted her to sample on some of my favorites from there.  Well... she was on a diet and ordered a salad... so I had a fridge full of delicious appetizers when I woke up the next day.  BJ's Chicago style pizzas are fantastic!  I've tried many different types and each ones that I've had has been great.  The awesome flakiness, crispiness, and buttery taste of the crust is something that will have you eagerly wanting to return to give them more of your money.  They're also well known for there very popular dessert, the BJ's Pizookie... and they're awesome!  They're cookies baked in their own individual deep dish pan, then topped with ice cream... nuff said, lol.  I'll actually stop by every once in awhile just for a Pizookie, yes, it's that good. BJ's also has a great mix of sandwiches, burgers, salads, pastas, giant stuffed potatoes, steaks, ribs, chef creations, and more.  I personally like the California Burger, Tuscan Chicken Limone, Fish & Chips ,Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich, Grilled Chicken Club, and of course the pizza! If you like great food and a great beer then I suggest you check this place out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=260,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.7039999999999997,3.6400000000000006
169,Mike D.,"Palmdale, CA",385,349,2091.0,4.0,2012-07-20,"I read reviews here that are all over the place for BJ's Palmdale so after my first visit (which was good) I decided that I would wait till I had a couple of visits under my belt before passing judgement. Today was my fourth visit and I have not had a problem with the food or service. My first visit was for dinner, I was to meet up with a group of about 8 people. I arrived a little early just as two others in our party were arriving. We  were the first to arrive, reservations had been made and we were immediately seated. The other members of our party soon arrived and although the restaurant was crowded our orders were taken right away. After a fairly short wait considering the amount of patrons our orders were brought to us. I ordered the Cajun Pasta which consisted of blackened chicken breast with a creamy tomato sauce , roasted red peppers and red onions tossed with fettuccini noodles and topped Parmesan cheese and green onions. I enjoyed the meal, finding it very flavorful with the chicken being tender and juicy. I only ate half to save room for desert. The waitress came by and boxed what was left of my Cajun Pasta and I ordered the Pizookie which consists of a large chocolate chip cookie in a pan topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. The Pizookie was very good and even though I had only eaten half of my pasta I was unable to finish it, but I did come close.  My next three visits were for lunch after seeing a movie at Cinemark which is right next door. To keep this review from getting too long I will give this blanket statement that will cover these three visits as they were all very similar. I will list all the meals and post photos of them as well. I was seated and waited on quickly. My meals were brought to me quickly, I tried three of their lunch specials and enjoyed them all! Here is a list of my three lunches:  Enlightened Barbacoa Tacos $5.95 (Lunch Special) Corn tortillas filled with spicy, tender barbacoa beef , topped with cabbage, Baja sauce and pico de gallo. Served with black beans and a tangy slaw of shredded cabbage and jalapeno pickled carrots and onions. Chicken Quesadilla $5.95 (Lunch Special) Grilled marinated chicken, green chilies and Jack and Cheddar cheese melted in a crispy tortilla then drizzeld with avocado cream sauce and sprinkled with cilantro. Served with fire-roasted tomato salsa, Baja sauce, sour cream and black beans. Parmesan Crusted Chicken sandwich $6.50 (Lunch Special) Parmesan crusted chicken breast topped with a fresh tomato basil blend and melted provolone cheese with mayonnaise, shredded lettuce and creamy garlic dressing on a toasted French roll.  Served with wedge-cut seasoned fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=220,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.6719999999999997,3.6800000000000006

I have had some very pleasant experiences here, hosts are almost always on the ball and courteous and servers are occasionally a lot of fun and a pleasure to be around.  Note that I said occasionally and not often.  We have had a few (3 to be exact) experiences that have left us to avoid this restaurant for the most part.

My husband's meal was comped two weeks in a row for excessive waiting. And when I say ""excessive"" I mean, eight people are practically done with their meals before he received his. Another person's sandwich was given the wrong bread and she waited, with her incorrect meal, several minutes until they brought her the correct bread. Why they didn't see fit to remove her plate and correct her sandwich so it would stay hot, I can't tell you.  This place is very busy and, while I have had no problems when we have been there as a couple, they do not seem able to accommodate a group - and this fact has been validated too numerous of times.  * * * * * * This is a chain restaurant so they have the corporate thing going: pleasant hosts ready to greet you the moment you walk in, wait staff always polite and knowledgeable, menu items always prepared the same. They can also split tabs which is a positive. They can get pretty busy (and loud) so you may have to wait, especially if you're with a group.

I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken, which was thinly cut chicken with a nice even layer of parmesan cheese that had a nice golden color that was topped with sun dried tomatoes and came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The whole dish was pretty big and would be plenty for two people to split. Since it only takes me a few bites to get full, I took the other piece of chicken with the potatoes home. This dish is definitely better when it comes straight from the kitchen. I ate the dish the following day and of course it wasn't as good.  My hubs ordered the jalapeño burger, which was a pretty big sized burger that also came with a side of seasoned potato wedges. The burger was pretty delicious and cooked medium well. For two entrees and a pop, our total came out to around $32. Not bad for a delicious meal. We were way too stuffed to get dessert, but definitely looking forward to coming back!

We got there and they were pretty busy. We did get to sit down immediately so they weren't extremely busy. They seated us, and we waited about five minutes till our waitress came to get our drink order. We ordered dinner when she brought our drinks about 10 minutes later. Then we sat there for about an hour before we got our food. Our waitress came by a few times and said the food was coming up soon. Finally our waitress said she knew we waited a long time so she would send the Manager over to our table to ""take care of us"". Well, he didn't take care of anything. He just came over and said the food would be out momentarily. Then he disappeared. Finally we got our food and we ate our meals. The food was fine. We were expecting our bill to have some kind of a discount for our long wait, but it didn't. We were very disappointed with this. The Manager just went back into the back and hid away! So, we just want everyone to know that BJ's is not about customer service and satisfaction. They are just about money. They weren't even very apologetic for making us wait so long. They really didn't care about us. Very disappointing!

Milestone birthdays, graduations, etc. have all been celebrated at BJ's. I can honestly say that I have always had good experiences here and never really encountered any problems. The hosts are always cheerful, the staff is always pleasant, and the food always meets my expectations.  They have a pretty good Happy Hour. Personally, I don't drink but the little appetizer deals they have are reasonably priced and delicious. I recently signed up for their email club thing and I occasionally receive fairly good deals. The Avocado Egg Rolls are incredible, a must try if you haven't already. My absolute favorite dish is the Chicken Alfredo with angel hair pasta. I can literally eat my weight in that stuff, it is dangerously addictive! My parents always get the Buffalo Chicken pizza and that is pretty good as well.  And oh yeah, PIZOOKIES!

208,Ruben R.,"Palmdale, CA",88,66,21.0,1.0,2015-05-01,"I go to BJ's all the time, probably 2-3 times a month. Their service is not consistent at all and when they mess up they don't do anything to make up for it. I arrived with one other person and it took them about 10 minutes to take our order which is fine... But then we waited for an hour and a half to be served. The soda was flat, and so I asked to change it for another drink instead since it didn't taste right and they said they'd swap it out at no extra charge... then I was charged for both drinks at the end. The waiter came back every 20 minutes to let us know the food would be out any second, and that the reason it took so long was because they were just finishing up the salad... As if a salad takes so long to make, at least do not lie to us about why something is taking long. The 2 people next to us had a different waitress and they got there about 10 minutes after us, they ordered, ate, and paid their bill before we were even served. When they finally brought out our food, they forgot half of it. The salad was less than half the normal size, only about 4 bites worth, and they forgot all of our sides saying we didn't order any. I complained so they brought out my side of fruit, with nothing but watermelon and only half filled to the cup. They took back the salad and took another 20 minutes to bring it back fully filled. Another group of people next to us hadn't placed their orders after sitting their for over 30 minutes, and they had the same waiter. Of course the only tip I left was that the food tastes better when it's not served an hour and a half late, that and the extra money they charged me for the flat soda. I was going to wait until the waiter came back to pick up the bill, but after sitting there for 15 minutes waiting for him to come back I had to pay cash and left. Terrible service.

My husband got the thick crust pizza and stated it didn't have barely in sauce on it. I got the flatbread tomatoe/basil pizza. It tasted wonderful. However, I believe I got food poisoning. I had two pieces from it. We went to the movies after and my stomach started hurting really bad. I didn't think it was from the pizza since it was so good.

In all those years, I have almost always had exceptional, friendly, and quick service.  I rarely wait at all before being taken to a table and almost always have very prompt service. In the extremely rare cases that I have any problems whatsoever, the management team does an excellent and quick job of fixing whatever has gone wrong. To me, the true hallmark of a business that cares is not providing excellent service 100% of the time, a feat that is largely impossible, as everyone has a bad day, but in ensuring that problems are fixed and errors corrected.  I can say honestly and with great certainty that this particular restaurant has always done right by me, and I will continue to eat here for years to come.

We had a party of 14. Everything started off fine until our waiter, Domenic, came to the table to take our order. Something was wrong with him. He was bothered, annoyed, frustrated, angry, just plain RUDE!!! First of all, he came to the table rushing us to take our order. I had to tell him numerous times that I wasn't ready yet. As I stated, I've been there plenty of times so I wanted to try something new so I asked him if he tried an item on the menu and his response was just dry and nonchalant, just letting me know I was getting on his nerves. We were thinking at the table maybe he is overwhelmed by our party size because he was working the table mostly by himself. The food took about 20 minutes to come out and it was cold. We weren't going to complain because once again we had a large party so we just dealt with it and we didn't want to have any problems. We just wanted to enjoy our meal. The finally straw happened when my friend stopped Domenic while he was walking by (he never checked on us after the food was served) and he got mad, stopped, looked at her and said,  ""I'm going to take another order, what?"" She was shocked of course and asked for extra dressing. He took over 5 minutes to come back with the condiments. Then someone else at our table asked for water refills then he responded in a nasty attitude, ""Well how many do you need?"" That was it for us! Done! Our waiter was acting as if we were asking for him to go to his house, make our food and bring it back to the restaurant! I was astonished. We started to look around for someone who looked like a manager and we found him. Someone from the table got up and spoke to him about everything that had happened and his response was he was going to take care of it....Well him taking care of it was giving us 2 new waiters. That was it. No type of accommodation for his employee ruining our dinner. He didn't come to speak to our table either. We wanted to order more drinks and dessert but we were scared something would happen to our food so we paid and left.  I have never in my life experienced such unprofessional service. We did not feel welcomed. We felt like a nuisance. I have 400 points in premier rewards so that alone can prove how often I'm in there giving them my money. The 2 new waiters we got were very nice and we wish we had them from the start. I honestly do not know if I'll ever be back and I am sad about it.

They've got a great bar area, plenty of seating options for larger parties, and nice cozy seating areas for those out on a date.  It has a nice layout, is well lit inside and has a good wholesome feel to it.  My family and I were quickly seated, for both of our recent visits, in a nice big booth in one corner of the restaurant and it was rather pleasant both times.   During our first visit, we were seated by a nice young lady in a corner booth during a busy time.  She was friendly, but I don't remember her name.  During our most recent visit, we were seated by Jonathan, and he was extremely professional and friendly.  We waited for just a few minutes while he did everything he could to quickly find us a nice big booth for my large family.  BJ's is lucky to have Jonathan; he's a real pro! During our first visit, our waitress was Jolin, and she was friendly, professional, and she had a great personality. We had a few tricky orders specifically related to food allergies and she was very patient in explaining details related to ingredients in their food. She also provided us with a menu detailing the items that they have related to folks with allergies. She was awesome!  Also, thanks to the management at BJ's for creating this menu, because it is really helpful for families like mine.   During our most recent visit, we had Kaytlen as our waitress.  Once again, we were lucky to get another totally awesome waitress that was friendly and patient with our complicated orders.  Kudos again to the management at BJ's for hiring awesome waitresses!    Our meals were pretty good during both of our visits, but each time there was something disappointing about the meal. During our first visit, my kids' meals looked delicious and they were all impressed.  My meal, on the other hand, was below average during our first visit, where the bacon cheeseburger I ordered appeared to have unusually fatty and low-quality bacon on it.  The bacon seemed to reduce the overall experience of eating the burger instead of the opposite.     Our meals during our second visit were opposite, where my meal was above average and my kids' meals were below average.  The disappointment during this latter visit included two pizza meals that were noticeably over-cooked, and a delayed meal delivery for one of my kids by several minutes, in addition to it having an incorrect side dish.      In summary, I think that BJ's is a great option for lots of folks in the AV with an excellent atmosphere and an awesome staff that interacts with their customers.  This BJ's could definitely do a better job in the kitchen, where arguably the most important function of any restaurant takes place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=40,3.6,3.4,3.4,3.2800000000000002,3.4800000000000004

(She was pregnant and wore glasses) did not catch her name. She gave us a dirty look and told us it would be 15 min to have a seat. This was not how I wanted to spend my birthday!! So we all decided to go elsewhere. As we headed out a young man chased us out and asked us to please stay. I explained what happened and he offered everything he could and said we would only deal with him. We thought that was awesome of him to put himself out there like that so we decided to stay because of his customer service. His name was Cody he totally turned our experience around!! Now Cody has the personality and customer service that this restaurant needs. I'm sorry but that girl is going to make you lose customers not gain. She does not belong in a field where she has to deal with people or in the front for that matter.

She was slow which I could forgive but she was also short, blunt, and rude. After waiting ten or so minutes for our waters she took our order (not a big deal) the food came out 30 minutes later (still maybe not her fault it could be the kitchen). However, she was not the one to literally plop our food on the table and walk off with out so much a glance, she never came back to our table. Not once. She didn't refill our drinks ever, even though we attempted to make eye contact with her on the rare occasions we could see her. She also finally took our plates away, and without a word took away a plate I was still eating from while it was under my face, and there were three clearly empty plates at the end of the table for her to take. Then she ""split"" our check and was apparently too stupid to run two cards separately even though they were separated by the three way split bill.

When I asked for extra ranch for the wings (I am a sauce-aholich) Jacob brought me a LARGE side of ranch (typically servers bring an itty-bitty ramekin). He understood what I meant when I told him I needed a lot of ranch. I have a tendency to drink a lot of tea especially with a spicy dish. Jacob refilled me about 5 times, never going a minute without a drink! He even hooked us up with drinks to go when we were finished.

Ordered a brewhouse CHEESE burger without lettuce or tomatoes.

I waited about 5 minutes more for my wine. She takes our order and my husband tell her no chipolet on the Avocado burger I don't like spicy. She takes my order and off she goes. People who ordered after us were getting their orders before ours which we thought odd. Not once did she come and check on us and it ended up that their were Jalapeno's on the burger and by that time my husband ran out of tea and was on fire. She never came back until we were nearly done. He mentioned that their were jalapenos which made the burger unpleasant to eat. She argued you said no Chipolet and we said nothing spicy.

It took about 10 minutes for the drinks and 20 for the apps. We had no appetizer plates and had to ask for them.  Alexis came to see if we were ok and we ordered. We are 40 min. into the experience at this point.  The food came and my son ordered a full rack of ribs and received a half rack. I told the food runner and she said she would fix it. 3 out of 5 of our party sat with our food for about 10 min. before the other 2 got their food.  I ordered 2 meals to go and before the appetizers even hit the table a food runner brought a to go cup of soup and nothing else, no bag no nothing.  The other half of my son's ribs came after the meals were finished.  I though at one point a manager would come to the table but he was nowhere to be seen.

The sinks were wet and 2 out of the 3 soap dispensers were empty.  The interim between the restrooms and the dining room had paper towels and trash on the ground.  I'm a wheelchair user and going to the bar the accessible area was cluttered with dirty plates and ketchup bottles. I didn't order the drink I wanted.  There were employees standing around talking loudly around our table (by some computers) and one in particular was extremely rude and obnoxious. His name was Jacob.

When I called on the day of the reservation the hostess on the phone assured me that my table would be ready and there was a 10 min window. Having this info I let my friends and family know that it was good to head on over there at 7. Well, we arrived at 7pm and the hostess said my table wasn't ready and it would be a 25min wait. Long story short after about 50 minutes of waiting to be seated when I have made a freaking reservation the manger assured me that they were doing they beat they could. At this point I was furious. The little ones we're hungry & exhausted and my birthday dinner at this point was ruined. They finally got their crap together after an hour of waiting and complaining and got our party a table. The service was okay. I was not impressed. The manager did comp my meal & the kids meals (which was the bare minimum) but what really ruined the night after all the crap we had already gone through was that my BIRTHDAY pazoki never came out, no one sang happy birthday, my waitress never showed up again & I had to ask another waiter for my birthday Pazoki to go.

101,Tracy F.,"New Orleans, LA",18,67,12.0,2.0,2017-03-29,"I am very disappointed that my review is not a better one.  I've been here in the past and it's always been ""ok.""  I was looking forward to the pizooki so this is the place I chose for my family for my birthday.  I regret that I did so. What was RIGHT:  Isaac.  He is a star server - personable, engaging, attentive and thorough.  Unfortunately, after taking our drink and appetizer order, management sent him on a break and gave us to another server.  Because I don't know why the next events happened and if he had a hand in the break-down in customer service, I won't name the follow-up server. What was WRONG: ** The App -- there is NO cell signal in the restaurant (for AT&T) and even the guest Wi-Fi wouldn't allow me even enough of a signal to log into the app. ** Appetizers -- We ordered three appetizers: artichoke dip, calamari, and a kid's appetizer (thank you for telling us about this Isaac) which consisted of a garlic knot and some fruit.  The calamari made it out first with the artichoke dip following a few minutes later.  The bread and fruit took about 15 minutes MORE than the other two. ** Drinks -- I ordered one adult beverage at the start of the meal.  At no time was I ever asked if I wanted a refill, a different beverage or a glass of water.  I finally asked for water toward the end of the meal.  Other drinks were refilled about half as often as they should have.  Each time a drink was refilled, there was next to no ice.  We asked for a glass of ice and it took 3 requests and 20 minutes of waiting before we were able to get it. ** Entrees -- within the group, we ordered a pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, kids spaghetti, a pasta dish with soup and a taco plate.  10 minutes after ordering, our server (not Isaac) returned to say that they were out of spaghetti and meatballs and asked one of my guests to choose something else.  It took another 10 minutes for the server to return to take the new order.  I tried to ask if they'd be able to fulfill the rest of the order (pizza was supposed to have meatballs on it and kids spaghetti was...well, spaghetti) but he left while I was talking.  Perhaps he was pre-occupied and didn't realize I was making an inquiry.  We waited somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour for our entrees.  Other tables were seated, ate and were preparing to leave before we got our food.  Our original server, Isaac, left for his break and came back before our food was delivered.  When it was, the pizza had no meatballs and the soup was never delivered. ** Take-away boxes -- it's hard to believe that this could get messed up, but it, I kid you not, even that wasn't done with any thought for the guest.  I had 2/3 of the pizza left.  Our server did not bring out a pizza box, instead brought a couple of small styrofoam containers.   At that point, having seen Isaac on the floor, I finally asked if we could have him back for the last few minutes of our service.  I'm sure this didn't make the server that was handling our table very happy, but the night was a disaster.  I was trying to at least redeem dessert. ** Dessert -- we ordered the pizooki trio.  While the flavor was very good, they were severely overcooked around the edges.  This was our ""on the house"" comp for the troubles we'd reported to the manager.  It was severely lacking and very disappointing. ** Check -- We were there on a Monday which is supposed to be half-price pizza day.  Our pizza was originally rung up at full price.  The soup that I'd requested be removed from the bill since we never received it, was still there.  There were evidently other issues as well to which I'm not privy since someone else was treating me to dinner for my birthday.  All I know is that the check had to be sent back at least once for discrepancies.  I do NOT attribute these to Isaac because the issues had to do with what was put in by the other server.  Isaac was very quick to resolve the issues once pointed out. I said at the start of this that I was disappointed to write this review and that is true.  The food here is generally good and it's got a good variety for groups.  That said, considering our latest experience, it won't be at the forefront of my mind next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=80,3.24,3.21,3.292,2.3760000000000003,3.222

We were feeling adventurous and decided to try different beer than our usual. When we ordered our first round the server made what appeared to be disapproving looks and sighs. Like they were bad choices. The beer was fine but it was the only round we ordered. I ordered the Late Night Burger. The server warned me the egg would  be cooked over easy with a runny yolk. I told her that's exactly how it should be. When it came to me the egg was small and cooked over medium with little yolk. My husband had Parmesan chicken which was fine. The food had been dropped off by another server who basically put the lukewarm food on the table quickly and ran off. No ketchup for the fries and our server didn't return to the table for another 20 minutes. In fact we probably only saw her 3 times. That was enough to know she had an odd sense of humor.

We listened to our pizza loving son to go there, but today was by far the worse service and will be the last time I ever go to bjs in Palmdale! First we were asked for phone number to get a text message when our table would be ready and they didn't seat us after 10 minutes of getting the text our table was ready. I even asked the hostess I got the text is our table ready after getting up from where we were waiting. So after we get seated we have the waiter come and get our drink order after a good 10 mins there, so we tell him we are ready to order, he says sure he took down our order. After about 20 minutes our food comes my son was already asking why are they taking extra long to bring our food, so the waiter brings my sons pizza and lemonade and usually we argue with my son not to finish all the lemonade so fast today he said it tasted weird and it kind of did, later after 10 mins my food comes and he mumbles to my husband  there was a mishap with your order it'll be right out, I wanted to wait to eat with my husband but my food was getting cold he brought over some ranch and didn't say a word to where the burger was at, at this point we are all upset I didn't even have two bites of my food we had to get up and leave we had already lost our appetite so we got up and my husband spoke to the hostess and manager came over now she was justifying her employees but we were done.

I keep trying because I used to like the food (pizzas etc.). My second to last experience the waitress pocketed cash intended for the bill and over charged my credit card. Then pretended to be confused. I did not report her to the manager because I was in a hurry to get to my next engagement. The last experience was 6-10-17. The food was less than good. The waitress brought my grandmothers salmon to her and after a few minutes the waitress returned and said it was the wrong one and took it away. It appeared that she gave to to a nearby table. My grandmother had already touched it. I usually enjoy fish tacos and I could not finish mine as they were doused in too much sauce. The pepper jar was not screwed on correctly and the entire jar of pepper fell into my sisters chicken and rice meal. She couldn't finish her meal either. My mother ordered a cheese appetizer (mozzarella cheese sticks) and was brought pot-stickers instead. At this point I asked for the check because I wanted to leave. 15 minutes later we had not received the check. We asked for refills and never received refills. The waitress returned with one refill for the wrong type of soft drink. My mother couldn't drink it. Mid way through the meal I wanted a high chair and an extra plate both of which I had to retrieve myself because I was tired of waiting. The waitress did take the ruined chicken and rice meal off the bill. I quickly signed the receipt/bill because my 9 month old was getting fussy from all the waiting and went outside. We were waiting in the hot car for my mother to join us but instead I received a call from my mother saying the waitress was holding her hostage inside the restaurant because she did not see the signed bill.  I had my baby hysterical in the car at this point and I couldn't leave the restaurant without my mother. I had the baby so my disabled grandmother walked the copy of the receipt I kept in my purse back into the restaurant. Again, I was late to my next engagement because this experience took too long.

The salad came out after a reasonable time.  However, the salad barely resembled what I am used to. Being a national chain, I expect it to be same at each location.  This salad was missing avocado, had way too much corn, the lettuce was soggy and the ""grilled"" chicken seemed soggy like it was microwaved (no grill marks at all).  Also, the corn and tomatoes were almost definitely out of cans, which I hate the flavor of. The location I usually go always has fresh tasting lettuce and veggies.  That being said, I did not complain at the time because I was hungry.  I was served relatively quickly for a crowded place, but I did notice several others at the bar waiting for drink refills or to tab out while the two bartenders chatted away.  I don't think I'll waste my time here again while I'm in town.

My husband and I used to love coming to this place, and the rating is not about the food my rating is more so about the service we received, which has led us to never go to this particular location again. We arrived when it was kind of a rush hour so we had to wait about 30mins to be seated which I was perfectly fine with. Once we were seated we literally sat for about 25mins without anyone coming to our table to take our drink order or anything ? Or atleast let us know that they would be with us shortly. And to my surprise another party was seated in the table next to us after we had waited that long and they had a waiter on the spot right away !! They took out their drinks and their order while we still had no waiter come to our service. So finally my friend went over to the front to let them know what was going on and the employee said he would get that checked out right away! Which he didn't we still sat for another 10 minutes or so, at this point I was over it and asked to speak to the manager. The manager I will say was mediocre!!! She took no responsibility and offered no apology all she said was ""I'll see what's going on"" finally a waiter arrived about 20 minutes later to take our order and said hello how are you and my friend responded with I'm hungry and she had the nerve to look annoyed and respond with well hello hungry !! I was so done ! I said how are we going to receive bad service and on top of that have the waiter be sarcastic? Nope not cool!! The manager never came back to see if we were okay or anything ! I just want to say I was not looking to get a free meal or any discount but it would have been nice if the manager would have taken responsibility as a manager and apologized. It's not a restaurant where a meal is $5 so I expect to have decent customer service and even if it was just a $5 meal I'm still paying my hard earned money so i should be able to get good customer service.

Placing the on-line order was fairly easy; Pick the store location, select your items, request the pickup time, and done.    My order for the BJ's Favorite pizza was placed at 6:30 for a 7:15 pickup time. (45 min should be plenty of time to make a pizza.) Paused the MNF game at 7:05 and headed over to pick up the pizza.  Got there at 7:15, parked in the curbside pickup space (in the back), and called the number to say I was here to pick up my order.  I was told it'll be right out.  We waited, and waited, and waited... at 7:30 I called again and said I was waiting for 15 minutes. They again said it'll be out in a minute. 10 minutes later (25 min total), I headed inside. As I almost reached the door I saw my pizza was being delivered but I stopped him and asked to speak with a manager.  I explained the waiting and two calls to the manager and she started explaining something about being busy.  I told her I placed my order 45 min early and then waited for 25 min after the expected time.  She didn't say anything to that so after an awkward pause, I said they can keep the pizza and I'll get one elsewhere.  She that said I can just have the pizza without charge, and then something about their ratings.  (Couldn't hear because it was loud.) So we took the pizza but after getting home and opening it, I realized I should have just left it there. This pizza was nothing like we've had there before.

Ordered steak medium came out cold and well done. By the time my food actually arrived most of my other party had already finished. Sent it back, no apologies no manager to see what the issue was. I had to look for a manager and actually talk to her. Nobody was apologetic, finally I had to ask for water since I was still thirsty. But guess what that bill sure did come on time. Never once was I asked how the meal went. This sis not the first time come here for work many times and they always struggle with large parties. To add insult I still paid over 95 dollars in the tab for horrible food and service and I never even got to eat. Hopefully they get better but honestly I think multiple times is to much to keep going back. Hopefully manage my sees the comment and actually addresses the issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=40,2.76,2.84,3.22,,2.808

Our waitress was very nice and efficient which made the experience a bit more positive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=40,2.36,2.74,3.176,,2.588
54,Alyssa R.,"Palmdale, CA",0,1,,3.0,2017-11-13,"I just came to BJs around 4:30 on November 12 we walked in was told they would seat us in just a moment. Our name was called no later than 5 minute wait time ( perfect). Got seated ask for a high chair my husband and I are dining with a 2 year old. We waited about 10 minutes before someone came to ask for our drink order. (Our 2 year old was getting very impatient) finally came and got an order on our drinks. I asked for a Paloma which the waitress explained to me she wouldn't recommend so I asked for a black berry margarita which she said was her favorite. The drink was very bitter I wouldn't recommend it or maybe we caught the bartender on a wrong night. We order the artichoke and spinach dip with chips appetizer took about 15 to 20 minutes for it to come out... when it did it was warm to cold as if it had been sitting there for a while. Which was weird because the bowl the dip was in was really hot so I don't know how the dip would be cold. Finally ordered our meals came out great on time and hot. We order a pazookie for dessert the cookie was very under cooked under the top layer was pure dough the flavor was great texture not so much. I'm leaving the review for the service although our waitress was not rude she was not as attentive to our table as she was with other tables she was serving our empty plates stayed there so there was a lot of clutter on our table she never came to ask us for refill even for our toddler. I hadn't been to bjs in years because every time I past by its always packed with a 45 minute wait time. You would think it would be better. I think the wait time has to do with the slow service in there. Idk for better service and food go anywhere else..  (Yard house, claim jumpers).

24,Kayla M.,"Palmdale, CA",0,12,,1.0,2017-11-20,"Was here a few days ago to have dinner for the first time ever and boy was I disappointed. Our waiter seemed so overwhelmed with the amount of table he had to tend to so I don't blame him but service was extremely slow.  Our night: my boyfriend and I got there around 5pm on Friday had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 2 (no big deal. They seemed busy) got seated and the waiter didn't come over to our table until about 20 minutes after. He took our order and drink, another 20 minutes go by for drinks, 40 for food. Now I don't mind waiting if the food was worth it but it was definitely not! I asked for my steak well done and if came back medium rare... I'm not the one to complain or send the food back so I just ate my mashed potatoes and drank my watered down lemonade. Wasn't even in the mood for desert anymore since medium rare steak makes me extremely nauseous.

17,Marie Z.,"Norwalk, CA",5,1,,1.0,2018-01-02,"I absolutely hate doing this cause I always look for good in every situation. unfortunately there was nothing good about this my first trip to Palmdale Bj's. First we walked and sat in  the bar staff was friendly , ordered drinks it was a special night New year's day. My  great friend was celebrating an acceptance to a school. We ordered drinks, appetizer platter .They came about twenty min later  dropped off platter and walked away .No silverware ,no plates or napkins we waited for some one to come by nothing. Finally she brought plates, walked away and came back gave us one silverware setting and said "" well here is one for now I'll go look for the others ""I just thought well they must have been busy  ten min later, she comes back with silverware .Mind u we were pretty much done with appetizer . We ordered two steak plates and a brisket burger. About forty five min later she says"" ur food should be coming "" twenty min later she came back and said"" manager is with ur food now ""We were confused.  Finally food came out  ,I started to cut my steak and it was raw inside .Hesitant to send it back ,my friend said hers was to. My broccoli was completely disgusting ,her mashed potatoes were swimming in blood .I could not eat the steak ,so I sent it back and apologized  for complaining. Steak was returned ,by that time I wanted to leave. Asked for a box and the check. She didn't come back ,I had to look for her. The waitress looked tired and annoyed, we finally got our check and I tipped her twenty dollars and said ""u have had a long day and I appreciated her effort"" we walk over to pay and was waiting no one acknowledge us. Then the manager came over and we were paying with a egift card, we received as a gift   the manager runs the card and it declined, he then said that we needed to check the card on their site. He tried again and said it was declined .I had to pay for our food .He said that we would have to call and get another gift card not only was food bad ,but service was too we then left. I contacted the website and check gift card 3 times and was valid and had 100 dollars I was so furious and humiliated. I will never return to this location ever again .Now I have a freaking gift card I will never use ,cause BJ's Palmdale  I will not visit or reccomend  to anyone ever. I love BJ's Montebello. Amazing location but this one here is a complete disaster. They treated me and my friends like they were too busy to help us at all.
