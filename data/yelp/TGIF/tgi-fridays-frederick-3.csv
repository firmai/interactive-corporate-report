Melissa J.,"Frederick, MD",0,2,,2.0,12/7/2017,I'm surprised our server even noticed us. She was too busy flirting with her coworker while we sat at a table for 15 minutes. Food was mediocre. Definitely made up for the lack of service. I used to love this place before moving. The reviews tell it all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3
Brigitte G.,"New Market, MD",24,73,161,3.0,6/15/2017,"I had very beige experience here.  We started with the $10 endless apps.  Beware-this does not mean it's apps for the table.  It's $10 per person if anyone else wants some!  I 100% thought it was for the table.  I was disappointed that my waiter was slow with putting my order in for the next app and slow bringing it out.  The last time I visited this location, my waitress was on it!! The food for my family was fine. It was hot and normal chain restaurant quality.  The prices were very reasonable and it was clean. Servers are friendly.  They have a variety of American food.  I wouldn't mind going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3
Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",541,532,2449,3.0,8/8/2016,"This tgi Fridays. Was one of the only places open in the area past midnight. They close at 12:30. After the Nationals game. We needed a place to stop and eat. So this TGi Fridays was the place. When we walked in. The resturant was pretty filled at 12. The music was loud.  The hostess was confusing me. I'll explain!  He asked us where we wanted to sit. I told him somewhere quite because the music is loud. He starred at me with this puzzled look then says, ooh ok let me see what I can do. Walks away. Comes back. Says so you want a place where you can talk. I replied. Yes please. He said I have the perfect place. Where does this guy put us!! Across from the fricken noisy bar!!! I asked him if they could move us to the other side where it was quite. The waitress said that side is off limits. What!!!!!   Now. There was a lot of young people in there drinking late. I guess the TGI Fridays is the place to hang out late night in this town. I would never hang out here but whatever Aside from that. The food was good I have no complaints. We started with a spinach dip. It was good. Our waitress brought the spinach appetizer out with our food. Kinda different. I ordered the truffle burger. I thought the burger was good. Now I was starving! I only had a 2 fruit bar and 2 hot teas all day. So I think anything would have been amazing.  Overall. This tgi Fridays was a good late night choice. Better than the ihop or Dennys. Which are the 2 other Kate night options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3
Kim A.,"Silver Spring, MD",146,393,26,4.0,4/4/2017,"the boneless wings are good here! However , Fried pickles was too salty . The potstickers are good!  Barrtenders are awesome , and the coworkers .

Rizma W.,"Washington, DC",106,591,510,2.0,8/6/2016,"Be very careful when ordering the endless apps, namely when you get the bill.  The tip guide on the bottom of the receipt is NOT for the amount you ACTUALLY spent, before the amount you WOULD HAVE SPENT, have the discount not been applied. As a result, I gave my server almost a 75% tip and even though her service was good, it wasn't THAT good. It was my fault for not checking to make sure the amount was correct (terrible habit). I was tired and ready to go, so I didn't think much about it... until this morning. Thankfully the bill was relatively small, but I have a serious problem with disingenuous billing and tipping practices. With a party larger than our party of two, they could make out with some serious cash with this scheme. I used to work in the food service industry so I know how it goes, but don't try to trick your customer into giving you what you didn't earn. I value honesty above all else, and when trust is broken, it's very difficult to be repaired. And if I can't trust a restaurant to bill me fairly and accurately, which includes providing correct inaccurate tipping information, then I need to take my business elsewhere. I'll be patronizing a different Fridays location from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3
Courtni R.,"Hedgesville, WV",26,103,274,5.0,7/25/2016,"Stumbled upon TGI Fridays in Frederick one evening about a month ago and we have been back three or four times since then. I usually don't care for chain restaurants but this one is definitely a good one.  Their menu consists of mainly steak, chicken, and burgers. If you are into Jack Daniels, they have plenty of choices for you. I opted for a non-Jack Daniels flat iron steak the first time we came here and it was delicious! Cooked perfect with just the right amount of seasoning. Their rice is really the true gem. It is absolutely perfect. If you are not a rice fan, you will be after you try their rice. It is sweet and has little pieces of red pepper mixed throughout it. Yum!  Most recently I tried one of their sizzling entrees with chicken and it was also delicious. There's just something about your meal coming out on a sizzling hot pan that makes it all better. Under the three large pieces of chicken was a bed of red and green peppers and onions.  Also, I would like to give a special shout out to our server that we seem to get every time (Autumn) who is so friendly and nice. She has really taken care of us every time we've stopped by. Plan to stop by again very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3
Danii K.,"Myersville, MD",57,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,"For starters...we walk in and head over to sit at the bar. The whole left side of the bar was empty and EVERY single table was dirty. We sat at the lease dirty table and sat there for a good 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. And that's while there were 3-4 workers just standing there talking! 2 mangers came out and 1 said something to one of the girls about her being on her phone texting. They laughed it off and we still sat there. FINALLY someone cleaned the table. Then after waiting the longest out of people that came to the bar to eat we finally got asked what we would like to drink. Then I asked for chips and salsa and that took 10 minutes and when I got them I got a big bowl of salsa and a baby handful of chips. You beat I asked for more chips! Then our food finally came and we both got a side of mashed potatoes and for some reason the mashed potatoes came with cheese...we didn't know that. Nothing was mentioned about cheese in the mash on the menu. I'm vegan so I couldn't eat them! We finished and patiently waited for our check....(another 10 freakin minutes), while our server just stood by the bar laughing and having a good ol time. Needless to say this was a terrible experience! They weren't busy at all just terrible, neglectful serves and managers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3
Sara H.,"Lima, NY",11,6,,5.0,7/6/2017,"Great dinner after a long day of traveling.  The hostess greater was very friendly and showed us to our table without any waiting  The food was really good. Our server suggestions were spot on with a full rack of ribs for me and the husband and endless appetizer for my son. I ordered the strawberry daiquiri and was really happy with it, fresh strawberries made it so delicious.  Loved it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3

Nick B.,"Potomac, MD",126,39,56,3.0,9/13/2016,"Started out my evening calling ahead to place an order so it would be ready by the time I got to the restaurant. However, I got put on hold and was still on hold as I walked through the door to see all the employees just talking and hanging around the host counter.... Not sure why no one could take my order over the phone?  It worked out though bc I noticed the bar had a pretty good selection of beer on tap so I sat down to find out they were serving $3 shorts on draft of all the beer!!

Alex H.,"Ocean City, MD",312,3,4,1.0,5/7/2017,"My family and I (7 of us) came to TGI Fridays here in Fredrick at around 4:45 p.m. on a very slow Sunday. It's 6:15 and we're just now finishing our food. It took at least 20 minutes just for water to come out. It took an hour for our food to come out and two things were incorrect AND cold when they came out. We told him that it was wrong. He took it back and then proceeded to bring the food that we sent out back to us telling us that we were wrong about it being incorrect. Management realized, after we brought it to their attention, that there was an issue. They were very apologetic for the issue. The two incorrect meals were free and we also received a $25 voucher for when we return. We usually have fantastic service at this location but today was a huge disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3
Tim S.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,5,,5.0,5/8/2017,"It's a freaking chain restaurant. What do you expect? I laugh at these complaints. These are the type of people who have never worked in a restaurant and expect the world to be handed to them. Anthony Lee is the best GM around. He will make sure your experience is A+. So instead of crying to Yelp, just ask your server or bartender (who are some of the best-- Kristina, Alley, Matt, Amber) to help right the situation. Don't complain about endless apps either because YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE RESTAURANT WHO IS ORDERING THEM! It will take more than a few minutes on a busy Friday night to get your tenth refill of boneless wings, because you and the rest of the jabronis of the world are making the fry cook make 25 orders at once. And yeah, the recommended tip on an endless apps bill is for the ORIGINAL amount. That's HOW you should tip! Ok I'm done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3

Brandi B.,"Frederick, MD",35,115,80,4.0,8/14/2016,"We usually have great service.  The menu is updated pretty often, but when they have the unlimited apps for $10 you should definitely take advantage of that.   Clean restaurant with a fun atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3?start=20
SA F.,"Frederick, MD",1,121,103,1.0,7/4/2015,"We walked in the door and saw a lone big steak knife sitting on the hostess stand.  Murder, anyone? No Hostess. Host returned a minute later, but did not clear the knife away when we pointed it out. It was a little unnerving.  This was 8 pm on a Sunday night. The place was dead. Maybe 5 customers total for the whole joint.  We explained to the host we wanted their BEST server. We are picky, but we tip well. They seated is across from the broken table of Pisa - a booth whose table had fallen over THE PREVIOUS WEEK & I guess they never got around to fixing it or removing it.  Beside the leaning/broken table was an empty table filled with uncleared dirty dishes from a past guest. That was never cleared off the whole time we were there.  TEN minutes later, we met our server. Nice girl, but if that was their BEST, that place is going out of business soon.  Forgot our straws. When appetizers came out, forgot our PLATES. Forgot our SILVERWARE. We Ordered Breadsticks. She forgot to bring BUTTER - Twice. Drink refills? What's that, you may ask. We had to ask 3xs.  Clear the table of dirty plates? Nope. Not once. We had to move our own dirty plates - onto the other table filled with dirty dishes.  We mentioned we were members of their Loyalty club (supposed to get a free appetizer) we didn't get squat.  Food came out with WET, cold French fries, tasteless mashed potatoes & over-cooked steak (medium rare was well done). The steak butter had melted and was, presumably the reason for the wet fries.  Manager, please. His trip to the table yielded us decent steak, fresh French fries & tasty mashed potatoes. That's it. Couldn't wait to get out of that dump.  Once again, really disappointed with TGIF in Frederick, MD. It used to be one of our favorite places to dine. Now, it's a place we'd like to just avoid altogether.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3?start=20

When I pointed that out to the waitress she made an excuse that someone in the kitchen had to leave. I asked rhetorically, ""then how did the table of 5 seated after us get their food already?"" I ordered the Smoked Stacked burger with everything, she even asked ""with lettuce, onion & tomato?"" I said everything. I got a burger with cheese, lettuce, bacon & Cole slaw. My wife had the Jack Daniels burger & the bacon was not cooked sufficiently.

Ordered vodka and sodas and she decides on her own to give us tall glasses with double soda because she was out of regular small glasses. There was hardly anybody at the bar so they were not busy.

Steve N.,"Mount Airy, MD",45,1,,2.0,12/15/2016,The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because of the 1 good beer they had on draft. The burger was terrible. Came out cold and dried out.

Kiss K.,"Walkersville, MD",0,29,48,1.0,5/3/2016,"This restaurant gave me a very negative experience, and I will not be returning. There customer service is inexcusable and their promptness to customer satisfaction is an all time low. When coming here for lunch, our waiter messed up are entire bill and then when going to fix it charged double. When confronting her about this she made a snarky remark about how we can check the bank because the first incorrect charge wouldn't show up. Well she was wrong. Then she proceeded to blame the new tablet systems. Another person in our party even received the wrong change, and was shorted money. When the manager came to assist he was helpful but clueless in the matter of being accommodating. I will not be returning.   The back of the house cooked us a great meal, but how can you enjoy a great meal when the front of the house staff gives you a negative experience. I also recommend this place take more consideration into cleaning because the tables look like they got a quick wipe, and the bathrooms are filthy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3?start=20
Stuart W.,"Damascus, MD",2,86,,1.0,7/27/2015,"Decided to return here and wish we hadn't. Sunday night, not too busy and seated straight away. However our server took too long to great us, take our drinks order and eventually our food order. She also rarely checked on us. But the worst thing of all is that we ordered an appetizer as well as our entree, and the entrees came out 5 minutes before the appetizer did. And the first time our appetizer was brought out, it was the wrong order. She gave us a pathetic excuse that because we ordered at the same time our entrees were made quicker - total BS, in all the years we've done this at restaurants this has never happened - and since when should a burger be made quicker than chicken wings? Even worse, the fries and burger I received were merely warm, as were the loaded potato skins in the appetizer. Same with my wife's chicken tenders and fries. We were both so hungry and fed up by this point that we just ate it - waiting any longer who knows how long we'd be waiting around. So overall, this place offers extremely poor service - frankly that server was lucky she even got a 15% tip. I would definitely not recommend you patronize them - we certainly won't be again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3?start=20

Brittany H.,"Sharpsburg, MD",1,47,,5.0,2/2/2017,"this location is SOOOOOOO much better than the hagerstown location!!!!! We've always gone here when we lived in Frederick and the service has always been fabulous as well as the food. Yesterday was no exception! Our server was Andrew and he was awesome!!! He let us know about a promotion they are doing with their rewards club where if you sign up, you get $8 off an appetizer or dessert, and I was already a member but my boyfriend was not, so we quickly signed him up to get that promo!!! We ordered two appetizers, he had pot stickers and I had potato skins, since we got $8 off one we figured, why not? They came out very quickly and they were delicious!! Andrew gave us enough time to enjoy our appetizers and space out the time between appetizer and entree. When he came to take our actual order, we both got the cajun chicken & shrimp pasta with breadsticks like we always do, and he recommended adding red onion and bacon onto it, which i had no idea you could do. OMG!!!! It made the pasta so much more flavorful!!! Im going to try to request it next time we go out to eat there again because it was SO good!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3?start=20

The server was very friendly. 3. The food quality was very good in my opinion.  CONS: 1. My wife ordered ice tea with extra lemon and initially didn't come with any. She had to ask a second time for the lemon.  2. I ordered onion soup as an appetizer which never showed up. The server did take it off the bill though.  3.

Sherry D.,"Charles Town, WV",0,17,1,3.0,11/12/2015,"Went here for date night with the boyfriend and we did enjoy our food. The server was friendly, accommodating, and did check on us... up until she gave us our food. She came back less than a few minutes later to ask if we were enjoying our meal and we hadn't even had the opportunity to really try it yet. After that, we didn't see her again for a LONG time. We ate our food, talked, and generally took our time, even discussed really wanting some dessert. Then time continued to tick by, we checked some emails on our phones, looked around for our server.... She was nowhere to be found. Even after eating we were waiting at least an additional 20-30 minutes, and we went from having time for dessert to needing to get to our next appointment. Even so, I lost the will to stay any longer for dessert, which was disappointing, because I was really looking forward to trying some.  By the time she did come by, she asked us how things were and tried to promptly leave again, and we had to actually ask for the check even though our plates were empty. By the end of our experience we just wanted to get out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frederick-3?start=40

Well the food came eventually.The fries were cold and we still didn't have the dang chips. We eventually asked for the manager. He did get on it but it still took foreveerrr for the food to come back out. This was ridiculous for a thursday night. I mean really but the place seem to be packed.

He tells us that he's not sure if there's tables available at the moment. Again, when I say the place wasn't busy. There was a complete empty section to my left. We finally get seated in a dirty booth! The seats were greasy and table has crumbs all over. We wait another 5-10 mins and we finally see a server. We order order our drinks. Beer that my fiancée ordered took about 10 mins and wasn't even correct. We ordered spinach dip and mozzarella sticks for appetizers . Spinach dip took about 20 mins to come out. Mozzarella sticks were quick. I ordered a classic cheeseburger that took another 20-25 mins to come out and when it finally does its COLD and fries are COLD and STALE!!!!!  The server never came over to check on us or to ask if we wanted more appetizers. We were eating on a table full of plates that the server never took back.! I wish I took a picture.! I asked for manager and they re did my burger . It was 10:35pm and honestly I didn't even want anything from this place! I'm never EVER going back again. This place sucks ! It's full of young servers that don't care about customer service!

The restaurant was not beyond 25-30% capacity for our stay. We had a female server at our place in the bar, and she took a minimum of 5 minutes whenever we needed her to do something (print a check, get any refill, process payment). She spent majority of her time at the cash register talking to co-workers. She seemed resistant to assisting us and this lead us to leaving the restaurant early.

I wasn't alone and the person I was with got the same treatment after also presenting valid unexpired matching ID.   PS: we were not intoxicated, but did drink the water in Maryland.....
