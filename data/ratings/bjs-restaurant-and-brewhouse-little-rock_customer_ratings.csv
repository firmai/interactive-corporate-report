90,Boyd D.,"Brentwood, TN",0,7,,2.0,2014-04-09,"So this was my first visit and apparently this place just opened.  The look of the place is nice and they have a great looking bar.  Our waiter was obviously new and quite uncomfortable in taking our order.  I ordered ""Santa Fe"" salad and it was really bad.  The lettuce in it looked like the iceburg stuff that would typically be thrown away.  It had been chopped sometime earlier and had the brown edges.  Very little chicken and all around just bad.  The homemade root beer was good, though.  Maybe they will work out the kinks of being a new place....I would wait a couple months before visiting this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=80,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
43,Emad H.,"Little Rock, AR",6,9,3.0,5.0,2014-04-10,One of the best restaurants in little rock if you like to try different food you should come here. I've been to a lot of restarants in little rock and all what you see is same menu: steak and mashed potatoes...etc This place serve various kind of food it worth a try. Now for the people who gave this place one star because this place didn't pay their electric bill or rent I just don't understand some people would say i hate this restaurant because the weather wasn't nice outside lol Anyways you won't regret coming here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=40,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001

I apologize on behalf of the human race for the experience the guy below had here but outside of maybe his experience, as I am sure it was only one employee or possibly even a patron who could have stolen the phone not a conspiracy including the entire staff and most certain the building itself did not consume the phone. You can not rate a restaurant or the food and staff on something that may happen once in a lifetime.  Now on to my review and the important part.  Our waitor Arturo was amazing, knowledgeable about the food the atmosphere the brewery and genuinely very nice. Bravo!  Ordered the in house brewed cream soda, delicious, end of story!  The food was amazing, I had the parm crusted chicken. Two large and very tender chicken breast meat covered in a crispy parmesan! Served with steamed broccoli and delicious mashed potatoes. Had left overs that Arturo boxed and bagged for us! My husband had the Jambalaya which was also very delicious! Even better, we don't eat pork and the sausage was chicken!!! It was a bit spicy so beware on that part but if you enjoy such as we do, dig in! Again, left overs! On to dessert, white chocolate macadamian nut wonder! It was a sweet toothed connaisseurs dream.

Quick, friendly service. Huge beer and drink menu. (-)  My only real negative is that the food wasn't anything to write home about. I tried one of the deep dish pizzas, which was mainly ALL bread (which I love, don't get me wrong) - but had few, if hardly any, toppings. It wasn't even close to comparable to true Chicago style pizza. My husband also had a steak, which was overcooked (despite ordering ""medium"") - it was definitely well done.  It's a chain, so honestly, I went in with lower expectations.

(Even though the calamari was only one layer deep it still didn't even begin to cover the platter.... This did provide us with a laugh and guessing game on where the rest of it went....)

I really hate when a dining experience is ruined by poor service.  The food here is good for a chain but we had such a terrible experience with the service I can't give them more than 1 star. When the server/expediter brought our food and another waiter helped put the food on our tables. Which is understandable since waiters help each other out. We see our waiter on the computer checking out tabs of a large party ~10 people.  However, there were a few condiments that they forgot to bring out (salad dressing and bbq sauce ) along with hot sauce so we asked for and we waited and it never came out. By this time this party of 10 is already gone and he only had 2 tables to serve. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen so we had to ask another waiter, in which she told us that she will tell our waiter and let him know. We waited and still didn't get any condiments.  Our waiter is still missing so I got the attention of another waiter who was passing by us and told him that we are missing our condiments and have asked several times. This 2nd waiter returned with our condiments and since our waiter has gone missin my friend asked if she can order soup. So the 2nd waiter puts in our order and brings it to us.  Our REAL waiter did not ask how we doing, how the food was, or fill our water -- basically did not check up on us at all until time for the check and then asked who ordered the soup since we asked for separate checks. We came in the middle of the week day and it was not busy by any means, there was about 7-8 tables filled in the whole restaurant. There was a couple across from us and they were not happy either. As the guy's steak was over cooked and service was also lacking. I overheard their conversation with the manger and she did not make things any better so I didn't even want to waste my time. We ended up did not tipping our REAL waiter and tipped the other waiter that actually did help us (and his area/zone was on the other side of the restaurant)! He was surprised but very grateful and thanked us. I'm not sure if the waiters at BJ's pool their tips and divide them later but because of this experience, I hope they don't pool their tips!

I have been here 3 times and every time the service has been horrible and the food has not been consistent. This last trip was the worst!  Went for lunch. Note it was not busy!  Our waiter acted like his head was somewhere else. I asked for water 4 times. Our food came out in stages. There were 6 of us and they'd bring a couple of people their food then 5 min later someone else a couple of minutes and two more people got lunch. I waited patiently for my Mac and Cheese and finally had to ask if it was coming. This might have been fine if our food was hot but it was cold and to top that off nothing like the last time we ate there. I asked the manager if they had changed their recipe on some of the food they informed me the chef did that from time to time.

As for me, I had three of the in house brewed ""Root beer"" served in the classic frosted mug and DANG it was a great treat. For my meal I started off with a ""twisted BLT"" side salad that was spot on in flavor. It was baby spinach with bacon, chopped tomato, boiled egg, and a vinaigrette.  Then I had the Cajun Jambalaya.  It was not a heavy cream sauce but a well rounded tangy with mild heat in the back if your trough rice concoction with loads of blacken chicken breast bites, shrimp with sausage to boot.  Now the low point was service was slow and a bit off sync with each other in the check in area, however I will take slow service over a pesky server.  My glass of root beer never emptied before refilled and the food was most enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-little-rock?start=80,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9280000000000004,3.0000000000000004

She felt nervous about drinking it because of his attitude. We were all so angry that we didn't even think to ask for a manager to tell him what happened. We just wanted to get out of there.

The calamari was cooked very well, breading was done properly and the squid wasn't over cooked, served with marinara and an other cream sauce, both tasted great.... The poke was delicious even though the salad prep forgot the avocado....  I had two of their house brewed beer. The American IPA it was ok but had too many caramel notes for a true IPA, leave it to the Americans to Americanize stuff that was perfectly fine already......""I'm white American born and raised"".           Then I tried the imperial stout... It was true to form however at 8.5% be careful of this one.. It's my personal opinion the the imperials should always be served 8oz at a time in  a proper 8-10oz open mouthed stemmed goblet glass... This does more to appreciate a complex beer and also allows time for the drinker to get a bearing on how much they have had..... My very nice waitress was probably told this because she told me it was similar to a Guinness, don't confuse the two styles, Guinness is light and creamy. An imperial stout is strong, black, bold, resinous, and sometimes bitter(which was the case for this one), and has 2 to 3 times the alcohol, 2 in this comparison.......  I like imperials and this was a decent imperial(think Old Rasputin with less flavor). 4 stars only because of lack of beer knowledge and missing a key ingredient in an otherwise tasty appetizer.... ....
