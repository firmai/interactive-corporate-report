16,Jody G.,"Buffalo, NY",154,745,201.0,2.0,2012-02-07,"It's usually pretty much the same.  Sure, they change the menu frequently.... but I think they just reshuffle the ingredients and the names.....nothing REALLY changes.  The only thing that varies is the quality of the staff.... and the people working at this particular ""Friday's"" are not the best.  It started with the hostess who told us that it would be about a 10 minute wait when there were CLEARLY open and clean tables.  When that was politely pointed out she said, ""oh yeah....."" and seated us right away. Then it was the waitress who flitted around a lot, but accomplished little.  Everything was promised in ""like two seconds"", but took a L-O-N-G time. Then it was the cooks.  This is standardized fare, yet something was a bit off with the saucing and spicing.  Guacamole on an Asian platter?  Bacon hunks in the cheese dip that comes with the soft pretzel sticks?  It wasn't there last time we had them.  And why, oh why was Szechwan dipping sauce on the ""Kansas City BBQ Burger?  We would have sent it back, but those ""like two seconds"" seemed to stretch on for hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
7,Mark M.,"Niagara Falls, NY",134,1018,6169.0,3.0,2013-05-07,"+ Nice casual atmosphere -  Ran out of ribs 8:00pm on a Saturday and the busy dinner crowd is gone! We wanted to order ribs, but they said they ran out--very disappointing.  We ordered burgers instead.  The bacon cheeseburger and the steakhouse blue cheese burger.  Both were cooked and tasted well.  The fries and mashed potatoes also were good.   The server was friendly, asking if I wanted refills on my drinks. I find you can't go wrong with going to Friday's, as long as they don't run out of your favorite item!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
13,Cass F.,"Lancaster, NY",47,22,3.0,1.0,2014-11-30,"It's been a few years since I was to a fridays due to a really bad experience.  The only reason I came back was because my girlfriend said that I should try it out again and see if I needed to continue my boycott of fridays.        First, we ordered and my girlfriend upgraded to the sweet potato fries for an additional charge, when she got them she asked for some honey and was told that they had been out for a while. Now I've had sweet potato fries a lot, most people put honey on them, that would probably be a good thing to tell people when they order them! So they got wasted because their not that great without the honey.       Second, I ordered the craft beer cheese burger which should come with cheese, fresh and fried jalapeños, and guacamole.  I found that there was no guacamole on it, so I asked if it was supposed to have guacamole,  and AGAIN was told that they were out.   I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO A FRIDAYS EVER AGAIN! And now the girlfriend is on board with boycotting too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
21,Sam J.,"East Amherst, NY",30,5,,2.0,2014-12-06,Service was ok but SLOW. It took almost 15 min before anyone even came to take our drink order! And the restaurant  was almost empty. I ordered a steak and it was really chewy. I won't be going back anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville?start=20,,,,,
19,Gina S.,"Amherst, NY",31,108,1.0,3.0,2014-12-13,"While not a fan at all of chain restaurants, this wasn't that bad.  Sat at the bar and ordered lunch - had to ask to have the heat raised then lowered then raised....  Typical bar food I.e. Hamburger and fries.  Nothing special but not bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
17,Bob C.,"East Amherst, NY",9,32,6.0,4.0,2015-01-19,"It's Fridays - I got what I expected.  This was a quick visit.  My wife and I split the hot pretzel app (it was tasty).  I ordered the blue cheese burger, and it was good.  My wife ordered the chicken fingers, and those were also good.  Ate and left, decent experience, I'm sure we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
18,Banita N.,"Buffalo, NY",0,6,,1.0,2015-07-01,Very poor experience. Took 25 minutes to get food. Then food came out not how we ordered it. Our server didnt even try to rectify problem. No LAST. No SERVE. No Management to touch upon tables. This Friday's is horrible. Giving 1 star is too many.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,

8,John G.,"Buffalo, NY",2,70,41.0,3.0,2015-11-01,This restaurant is pretty nice the staff at the bar was very friendly.  This is an awesome place for food a little expensive for my taste but the 5 and 10 dollar menu is the way to go.   The flavor of the pb and j wings was okay not that good I thought I was going to get real jelly ( just a Demi-glaze that tasted nothing like jelly) the Thai peanut paste was bland with the wings.  The preference for me with wings is blue cheese but I got ranch not that big a deal but it did factor into my stars.  I had gotten the apple cider ribs the food had a hint of an off taste after eating.  But all in all a nice place I would go here again and just order different foods. So all in all a nice atmosphere and the bartenders were talkative very nice and fast with orders as for the cook the food was cooked perfectly just an off taste at the end of each bite and combos.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
11,Katie S.,"North Buffalo, Buffalo, NY",117,35,3.0,1.0,2015-12-05,"My husband and I decided to eat here for a ""quick"" eat. Well... Yes we understand and expect a wait on a Saturday night. When we walked in there were empty tables not cleaned. The hostess was completely frazzled and talked about the two ladies that came in right before us to us. Said there would be a 20 minute wait, so we went to the bar... I was confused as there were a ton of tables empty but dirty. So only 10 minutes later... They had a table. Needless to say we waited 15 minutes for a server, an additional 20 minutes for water, and 10 minutes later for an appetizer. We both order steak. Mine was great, sides were sub-par. My husband order his steak medium rare, and came out well done. They brought him a new steak 15 minutes later. Needless to say either they were super under staffed, or not very well trained. We will not ever return to that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
14,Bill P.,"Buffalo, NY",0,7,,5.0,2016-01-14,Of all the chain restaurants in the area this one is the best!  Friday's has it figured out that you need to offer healthy food choices that taste good and at reasonable prices!  If your a Stripes member you get free Chips and Salsa as well!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
2,Sarah S.,"Clarence Center, NY",58,414,385.0,3.0,2016-01-16,"My husband's choice. Not my favorite chain by a long shot.  I let my husband pick the restaurant tonight. He loves those Jack Daniel's sauces and picked here. Well, actually he picked Buffalo Brew Pub first but I don't like beer and their wine list sucks so I said no, try again. And then he picked here and since I had veto-ed his first choice I was like, ""ughhhhhhhhh. okay"".   I had two strawberry daiquiri's. If they contained booze (and I was charged for booze), they had zero taste of it. They tasted good, but 2 and not even the slightest hint of a buzz means they really grinch you on the liquor.  My husband stuck to diet coke because we needed to go home and assemble a piece of furniture a'la Ikea style and that's already a marriage stresser, so he wanted to be sober to argue with me. Unsolicited marriage advice: do not buy anything that requires assembly. EVER. And don't argue with your wife, you're never going to win.   I digress: TGIFridays. I had a french dip. It was not good. The meat was fatty, it had too many onions and the worst thing was it was drenched in this sauce that tasted like tartar sauce. The fries that came with it were okay.  My husband had the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The ribs were super fatty and kinda gross, but my husband loves that jack daniel's BBQ sauce so he did not care. The fried shrimp were okay.   We also had an app, it was the loaded potato skins. YES, those I would get again. They are deep fried pieces of cheesy heaven.  So the drinks are weak, the dinners are meh but I'd come back for potato skins.   Service was good. We sat in the bar area and that worked out well for us with service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
6,Robin T.,"Buffalo, NY",57,87,316.0,4.0,2016-01-30,"Very busy and the wait was less then we thought, but it's been a year and a half and the prices have doubled. Which was a put off at first.  When we ordered our waitress was awesome.  The food was ok. It isn't the same Jack Daniels sauce I remember ered with the peppercorn and the Mac n. Cheese was more like Alfredo but grew on me.  It was very lively and I enjoyed the environment, but to pay prices like what we did we should've just gone to Black and Blue with twice the quality.  Between the cost and amounts of  food we got along with the recipe changes I just didn't feel a 5 star on this one.  The waitress was a doll though and given how busy it was Deanna (the waitress) was very attentive and charming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
3,Aaron T.,"Williamsville, NY",89,81,249.0,3.0,2016-01-30,"The food is always great here and in fact, I found our server to be pleasant and prompt in all cases.  Our mozzarella sticks appetizer was honestly the best in kind I've ever had.   My mediocre rating isn't due to our main server or the food quality at all, actually.  However the girl that delivered our plates had a definite problem with forethought.  She asks me to quickly grab the plate of food that she was delivering. I don't think she realized the small section she had was the only section that hadn't been under the heat lamp. As I grabbed the plate I realized this and quickly found my hand being burned.  I guess I break out the aloe tonight.  Also for the portions they give, this chain over charges.  16 dollars for 2, 3.5 inch pieces of chicken a hand full of grape tomatoes with little mozzarella balls cut in half and 6 potato wedges.  In the pic I posted you will see my keys near the plate the keyless entry remote is 2 inches long.  I may be overstating the chickens size.  You be the judge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
12,Mark M.,"Pinellas Park, Tampa Bay, FL",2,12,,2.0,2016-02-02,"Wow it's been a long time since I have been here, and probably will be even longer for my next visit. Server was excellent but the food value and tastiness was average at best. Ordered potato skins and pretzel rolls for apps and both were very good. JD chicken sandwich was just average and the fries portioned skimpy. JD ribs were not your fall off the bone type, over charred and tough. 4-7-4 promo is very misleading buyer beware. Overall just an ok experience with the overall abundance of restaurants in the area, I am quite certain I won't rush back. As a chain restaurant, I was quite surprise at the overall inconsistency from my buddy a year ago to today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
9,Lori S.,"Buffalo, NY",1,32,48.0,4.0,2016-02-21,"My husband and I come here often and eat at the bar.  Steve or Jeff are great at their jobs.  Very attentive.  Food is decent, drinks very good.  Love the friendly atmosphere and casual ambience.   Overall the reason we keep coming back is the service provided by Steve and Jeff.  Our favorite location by far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,

1,Ravi G.,"Buffalo, NY",133,47,118.0,2.0,2016-08-05,"The Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta is always phenomenal. One of if not the best dish you can get at a restaurant chain. That's what my mom orders literally every time. I ordered the jack Daniels chicken. Wow, the jack Daniels sauce is sooo sweet. Like I was eating a dessert AND it came with extra sauce on the side. It was borderline gross. Good thing I was able to scrape most of it off. Service was below average. We came between lunch and dinner and maybe 3 other tables that were being served. Our waitress was in the back just hanging out and talking when we wanted our water refilled and extra napkins. When she finally came and we were able to express our concerns, she somehow forgot, and had to be reminded again when she came back to our table. That really annoyed me. I could only imagine how crappy she must be when this place is even half full. Basically get the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta and be happy because you can expect most other things to go badly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
5,Hay M.,"Buffalo, NY",0,5,3.0,1.0,2016-11-12,"have been going here for years because its the closest. every single time they screw it up. tonight i ordered food with my parents. they spent alot of money,  as they always do and expect good food and service wich they never get. i am so sick of seeing fridays mess their food up and mine.i ordered the appetizer of pretzel sticks with extra beer cheese. idont need alot of food, and figured id save left overs.thats why igot 6 and not 2 sticks when they gave me the option.  we get there pick it up come home after a long day and i have 4 sticks with no cheese.   we just want to sit down and enjoy dinner, and i can't,because you suck at your job. every time i go there . please step your game  up or clean house with your lazy staff.thinking about driving back and slapping someone in the face with my cheeseless   NOT piss off a hungry hayley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,

0,Ivy Y.,"Buffalo, NY",117,14,59.0,4.0,2016-12-09,"TGIFridays Amherst is always good. I come here about once a month and the service is called consistently good and the food as well. As a rewards member I receive a free order of chips and salsa with each visit. For the amount of tortilla strips you get they could stand to give you a little more salsa, but it's not a big deal. I almost always get the Jack Daniels Chicken but this time I got the Bourbon Barrel Chicken. I chose the fresh tomato mozzarella salad and broccoli to keep the meal under 500 calories and it was very good. I also wanted a cocktail but I wasn't sure what to get so I asked the bartender (I was dining solo at the bar) to suggest something sweet. He suggested the Barbados Rum Punch (Mount Gay Eclipse Rum, mango, passionfruit & strawberry purées, lime juice, lemon juice, pure cane sugar, Sprite, Angostura bitters, orange twist). I asked for it to be brought with the food and he accommodated me nicely. It was very good. All in all I love TGIFriday's and I love even more that my entree was free tonight because I had enough points ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsville,,,,,
