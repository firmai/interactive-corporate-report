Mila A.,"Santa Cruz, CA",193,19,6,1.0,5/28/2017,"My family and I used to come here at least once a month, and the last three times we went were terrible. Just today, we were waiting to be seated for over 10 minutes... no hostess at the front, and two waitresses walked pass us. We had a 3 year old boy who was pretty hungry, so our patience was wearing thin. Then, another customer walks in, and gets INSTANTLY greeted by the manager. I tell her we've been waiting for 10 minutes, and she's going to greet and seat someone who just walked in???? Wow.  This location has lost us as customers for life. Maybe get new management who actually knows what they're doing and has had some basic customer service training!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20

Ashley K.,"Newark, CA",201,4,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Worst service! Food took forever to come out..... never got our appetizer until I asked someone to get our server and we already had our food. Didn't have silverware, she forgot our waters. The salad didn't come with dressing. This was the worst experience with chilis ever had.

Priscilla C.,"Fremont, CA",152,276,1410,3.0,4/24/2017,"This barely made it to 3 stars for me. Only reason why I added a Star was because the service was pretty good. The food itself was more like a 2, hence I won't really ever come back. I think I've been to another chain before, but I don't remember the food being this bleh. I opted for a lighter lunch and got the anchor salmon. Comes with rice and string beans. The salmon was a little too overcooked for me. The rice was okay and the string beans were so old and tough. I had to spit some out because I couldn't even swallow it! We also ordered the chicken fajitas. That was also not so good. The chicken had a weird bounciness to them, almost seemed like the middle wasn't cooked. It came with some wraps, salsa and sour cream and onions. We ordered the fried cheese as appetizers and that was probably the best dish we had and even so, that was just decent. Was really disappointed and I hate eating bad food because I feel like it wastes stomach space and I leave very unhappy lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20

Jimi Y.,"Schaumburg, IL",117,35,,3.0,2/18/2017,"Waited about 15 min to get seated.  No one was at the front desk and staff was walking pass.  hey people in front of me had to stop some some one with their hands full to get them seated.  Then the staff seated us.   Table wasnt set and the floor was slippery like some one spilled oil on the ground. Orrdered a 2 for $22 deal.  Got a 6 oz Sirloin steak and mango tilapia.  The steak for okay,  The tilipia wasnt good  well and it was kind of bland.  The potatoes seemed like there was too much butter and sour cream.  Service wasnt so bad as the Capatola Chilis but could use some improvements like giving us napkins with our meals.

Charlie A.,"Fremont, CA",0,20,,1.0,8/30/2017,"Visited the bar for a quick burger and beer.   Ordered the grass fed burger.   My burger was grossly overcooked... to the point where it was not enjoyable to eat. Service in the bar was poor.  No personality, no skills, no consideration for the charcoal burger. I used to enjoy a burger or ribs indulgence at Chilis.   Now, I am rethinking keeping Chili's on my go-to list, especially for hambugers.  When Carls grass fed is better then Chilis, they got a problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20
Neil K.,"Fremont, CA",5,512,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"I had come here last week for a business lunch and my food was satisfactory.  I had not come here for a long time so thought maybe the place has turned the corner and may be decent. Took my family in and it was a big mistake.  We usually get beef nacho's for an appetizer and first of all, it took about 45 min just to get this appetizer out.  Then I noticed the meat was not the regular meat they use for this dish.  Instead if looked and tasted like meat strips instead of the regular beef. One of our burgers was overcooked and inedible.   Showed the manager and she just shrugged it off.  I'm not one of those people who complain about the food so they take it off the bill.   If food is bad I'll just pay for it so i can get the hell out of the place and probably never come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20
Alex d.,"Fremont, CA",311,53,,3.0,1/13/2017,"When I went here on a different night, service seemed great, it was very professional and the manager even came up twice to see how we were doing.  Seems that they have a better team on days other than Thursday nights.  Last night (Thursday), our waitress was fine, but the other service seemed a little weird. My date and I walked in around 7:40pm, and it wasn't as crowded as usual and we were the only people waiting for a little bit.  They only had one half of the restaurant tables open.  It seemed like the staff were struggling because there weren't very many of them.  We waited about 7 minutes for a staff to appear to see that we were in the front.  She asked us which of the 2 groups were there first.  My date and I raised our hands, and she like ignored it and kept asking us which one was first.  We kept saying ""us"" and I guess she finally believed us. She said some stuff really fast which I didn't catch (probably that they needed to clear some tables first and then they'd seat us). We sat and waited to get a table.  Even though the place had mostly families, the crowd that night seemed to be kind of rowdy/ shady.  There were a bunch of people there just to eat at the bar thing.  As usual, it was crazy loud in there.  The staff came back to seat us.    The waitress came back almost right away and asked for our drink orders (waters) and we had to ask to get chips, about 15 minutes after when she came back.  We got our food in an average amount of time.  The food was good (I got a smothered burrito which was the size of a newborn baby), though some of the cheese in my burrito was not melted and it was kind dry on the insde.  We got a pizookie for dessert; the cookie itself was as dry as the desert (not dessert), but the ice cream on top made at least the middle edible.  When we were done, the waitress came by and asked if I need a box, and instantly handed me one, which was impressive. When I went to use the restroom, there was a horrible poo smell, coming from I'm guessing the men's bathroom.  When I came back out to go to my table, I overhead a female staff in the kitchen by the bathrooms say hecka loud ""...took a sh*t!""  Um, that's nice.  I don't know about you, but I'd rather not hear people that are involved with preparing my food even mentioning poop, haha.  I thought it was kind of unprofessional.   Basically, the food was good to alright, but the service last night seemed subpar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20

Derell L.,"Fremont, CA",6,28,,1.0,11/25/2016,"Well, this was just awful... We've been coming to this branch of Chili's regularly for most of the 20 years that we've lived nearby.  Food can vary anywhere from merely *good*, to really fantastic.  Service was always superb; our server would walk by every few minutes to see if we wanted anything; we used to have a joke about Chili's: ""Well, I guess we aren't going to save on tips today!!"". However, we haven't been in over a year... and in that time, things have really changed... Food was okay; my Ultimate Burger was excellent; milady's fajitas were so-so; even though they charged us $2 extra for beef, the fajitas were mostly green peppers and onion. However, service was appalling !!!  When we first were seated, we waited so long without being acknowledged in *any way*, that I finally grabbed some employee who was walking by, and asked ""does anyone even know we are here??  Nobody has spoken to us at all!!"" (except for the person who seated us)... this was after several minutes, at a time when most of their tables were empty (Friday evening, about 4:30PM). However, it just went downhill from there.  The ""server"" who was assigned to us, almost never came by... when I wanted a refill on beer, I walked up to the bar and ordered it myself.  When I wanted a refill on dressing for my fries, I had to walk up to the workers area and ask for it myself.  The server only came by twice; once just after I walked up to the bar myself, to see if I'd gotten what I wanted, and a second time to deliver our bill.  Just awful.

Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,3.0,8/20/2015,"I'm B-OK with ""Chili's"" and I jotted B-OK instead of A-OK deliberately, because I wouldn't want anybody to think I've mistaken this for A-quality food. For instance, I had the baby back ribs, and they're good, but they're not Texas roadhouse good. I mean, let's be blunt here. They're less than bountiful and the sauce is less than luscious. And I hate saying all this because I know tomorrow I'm going to get a message from ""Chili's"" PR apologizing that my ""experience"" wasn't up to par, yada yada yada, and give me a smarmy plea to give us another chance, yada yada yada, and it's probably somebody in PR that's never had Louisiana or Texas BBQ, never had anything but they're own food. Because this is what happens when you review a well-known chain and say anything that's not 100% flattering. But if you've followed me long enough on Yelp, you know me by now, and know that I review everything whether it was asking for my opinion or not. And so despite my better judgment, I press on. Yes, ""Chili's"" is reliably good if you like second-tier BBQ. I will probably be going back more throughout the years because I'll be raising a family. Did you hear that PR?? (Double-question mark.) I said, I will be back here more throughout the years, whenever I'm ready to gobble B-OK food at reasonable prices that's gentle on my pocketbook. I like the spaciousness of ""Chili's."" I like the fact that it's good for kids for that fact, and gives them a steakhouse type of ambiance with lots to look at, and an amiable staff of waiters good at entertaining kids off the cuff. For myself, I like the Sports TV's. I'm sure kids like the kiosks which gives you the option to order food if the waiter is not there immediately. I also, by the way, had bites of Southwestern egg rolls, chipotle chicken strips and Santa Fe Chicken Wrap in case you were worried I hadn't sampled enough here. Anyway, bottom line, I'm not a lover here but I like ""Chili's.""  #borderline",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20

Gina S.,"Fremont, CA",157,23,5,3.0,10/15/2016,"So, let me just start by saying, I come here often. I love the rewards system, just a few simple points and I'll get some free chips, a kids meal for the kids or even a dinner for two!  However, last Sunday, I truly felt so disappointed in not only the service but the food quality as well.  There was only 2 of us in our party, I'm not too sure how you could fall short as a server for a party of 2, but it definitely happened.  Asked for ranch, forgot the ranch. Asked for additional chips, never got. The best part, my fajitas were full of only onions, 1 small slice of a bell pepper and 3 strips of chicken.  Did I complain? Nope! I just ate and made the best of the situation.  However, here's where it gets rough.  Our server dropped our food off and not once came by to ask us how our meal was, nor refill our 'WATER' and generally I base service off of refills.  I can't get upset with a server for food, it's not the servers fault if the food isn't the best, but for refills and checking on customers - that's definitely the servers job.  So, when I looked around, saw that my server had stopped by her other '2' tables multiple times, I was pretty upset. I thought about grabbing the jug of water to refill my drink, but thought... 'Nah! Not worth it!'  After we finished our meals, dying of thirst, she came by and said 'here's your bill, please let me know if you need anything else!'  My reply 'How about some water and a kiosk to input my # for rewards' with a sigh, she said 'Were short on them!'  So, needless to say, no rewards for my meal and definitely no service!'  Good thing there's many Chili's in our area! This one, I probably will have to avoid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20

Apryl T.,"Fremont, CA",52,30,2,1.0,9/3/2017,"My server at Chillis was awesome; he was professional, courteous and very timely with my drink refills. The Manager for this location was not professional, in fact, I beleive she profiled me because of race and treated me indifferent compared to the other customers. When me and my husband walked in and our hostesses seated us, the manager said 'hello' to us as we walked to our table. There was a group of 3-4 that were finishing up that sat behind us; they used the table device to pay and left. We ordered our food, ate and discussed how we were going to tip our waiter (via cash or on our credit card). As we discussed the tip I noticed that the manager was awkwardly lingering by our table. As I took out my credit card she stared at me, then she moved right in front of my table and stood there ... watching me. It made me so uncomfortable, I didn't understand what was going on so I asked her if there was a problem. She explained that there was something wrong with the table devices and their internet connection so she was waiting to see if our device worked. If what she said was true why wouldn't she just take the devices off the table until the issue was resolved? Or have the waiters and waitresses process all payments until the issue was resolved? I told her if the device didn't work I would just pay though the waiter, I also had cash on me that I could use if all else failed. As I initially swiped my card through the table device the manager tried to grab my card so she could swipe it; I have to pull my hand away and tell her 'give me a chance to swipe my card'. She said 'okay' but still stood right next to me watching me swipe my card, select my tip amount, sign my name and enter my email address for the receipt. Honestly, I initially thought she was trying to steal my credit card information, as she stood so close to me, making sure she could see the screen of the table device and attempted to take my card out my hand. Then I realized she thought I wasn't going to pay, so she stood there watching me to ensure I paid before I left. After I paid the device turned green and she immediately picked it up off the table device as if she was looking at it, when I walked outside I saw through the windows she quickly put it back down on the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20
Simon F.,"San Lorenzo, CA",51,500,3317,4.0,10/31/2017,"On Saturday I had lunch here with my family and parents. Everyone booed and threw rocks at me when I walked in, and so I felt right at home. (Getting a pitcher of water dumped on my head was a bonus.) A woman and her daughter cut in front of us, but it didn't really matter. They were seated first because it was just the two of them. The hostess was pretty and professional. I was annoyed, however, when she asked me about whether or not we could fit in a booth. The booths here can barely seat 4. The 5 of us would have been packed like sardines in one. I strongly indicated that we needed to be seated at a table (for 6). Wardrobe Malfunction: The woman and her daughter were sitting near us. At one point, the woman's boobs fell out (they just needed some air). Sadly, though, I couldn't get my binoculars up in time. o_O The men's restroom is a little small, and it smelled like bleach when I went in. On the plus side, the restroom was clean. The tables weren't bussed as quickly as they should have been. We could have been seated at this one long table, but it wasn't cleared off for a number of minutes.  Our server was friendly, but kind of slow. I'm not docking for this, but she wasn't available when we really needed her (a group of about 8 took forever to order- some of the people were looking around like they didn't know what a menu was). My dad called the hostess over. To her credit, she filled in for our server and was very quick. (My mom was nice. Our server didn't deserve it, but she received a $15 tip.) A tall busboy made me laugh. He had a goofy look on his face and was basically dressed like a Chippendales dancer. The tables are too close to each other. I felt uncomfortable when a family was suddenly seated at the table behind me. (The area on the left is somewhat spacious, but it wasn't being used. People were encouraged to eat at the bar if they wanted to be seated right away.) Space is an issue in terms of the waiting area too. There are a good number of TV's inside (my dad was watching the Washington-UCLA game). We had to wait about 20 minutes for our food (it was busy here). Our bill was for over $90. Crispy Cheddar Bites: 8/10. ""White and yellow Wisconsin cheese curds topped with chile spices, cilantro. Served with ancho-chile ranch."" No one had any of the ancho-chile ranch. Anyway, I forgot from ordering them in the past that the Crispy Cheddar Bites would be salty (my wife thinks that the food at Chili's is salty in general). Still, they were good, and even my dad had some (he normally stays away from cheese). You receive about 25 Crispy Cheddar Bites, making this item easy to share. Pepper Pal Meals (for kids 12 and under): All the meals are $5.20 or $5.50. The portions are solid, and you can add a 2nd side for only $1. Chicken Dippers ($5.50): 8/10. My son liked his chocolate milk, and he was given a refill. He also liked the Homestyle Fries. The Chicken Dippers are made with all-natural chicken. I had one, and it was softer and tastier than I expected. House BBQ Half Order Ribs ($11.69): 7.5/10. My ribs were meaty and delicious, but I only received 3 (my wife was surprised, and my mom felt so sorry for me that she gave me a lot of her food). My Homestyle Fries were pretty good, but they could have been hotter. I also could have received a bigger portion. The BBQ sauce is just right (it's not too light or too strong in taste). Caribbean Salad with Grilled Chicken: 8/10. ""Pineapple, mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, red bell peppers, green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds with honey-lime dressing."" My wife enjoyed her meal. She just could have been given some more pineapple. The piece of chicken that I had was succulent. It was also so fresh that I had to slap it. ""Oh, behave!"" Mix & Match Trio: 8/10. My mom received a fair amount of food. She was easily able to make 3 fajitas for me. The steak and chicken were cooked nicely. They were also flavorful. The flour tortillas were strong and medium-sized. The shredded cheese was thick and solid in taste. The Mexican rice was spicy (this was a surprise, but not a bad one), but just average tasting. The pieces of shrimp were pretty small, but my mom and wife liked them (I don't know what he ordered, but my dad's meal featured some shrimp too). My mom didn't eat all of her onions, and she forgot to say that she didn't want any bell peppers (they no longer go well with her stomach). We had a nice time, and the staff worked well together. I wasn't happy about everything, but I recommend eating here overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2
Jamie L.,"Union City, CA",12,111,344,4.0,10/28/2017,"We had a late lunch here on a Saturday. The place was about half full and we were seated right away. We ordered the following. 1. Full rack of ribs. Half with dry rub and half with house bbq sauce. The latter was better. The dry rub was a bit dry but it was still good. It comes with a whole corn that was a bit mushy. The fries was just okay. 2. Cajun pasta. This was an alfredo based sauce with strips of chicken breasts. The chicken was tasty, moist and has a bit of a kick from black peppers. The pasta was nicely cooked al dente. The sauce was not as thick as I would like. It was still good because we managed to finish the entire thing. It comes with garlic bread.  The service was good.

I got their dinner for 2, and shared with my boyfriend. You get to choose 1 appetizer and 2 entrees. We got their fresh quacamole with salsa on the side. Their chips are served warm, very light, and crispy. Their chips are unlimited, so don't be afraid to ask for refills. I know we did. So worth!  I got their original chicken crispers and my boyfriend got their crispy honey chipotle chicken crispers. When the server came with my food, DAMN! My crispers were huge. The meal came with a corn on the cob and a side of fries, and five pieces of chicken. The crisper was fried perfectly. I thought it was all batter, nope! All MEAT! Yumm! Never thought I would rate this place a 5 star. Service was good too. Our server made sure we had water and refilled our chips.  Overall, I'm surprised about my experience here.

This place, having been here for half my life, brings me that warm & fuzzy feeling sometimes as it reminds me of those years of dining here just before we go off to the Haunted House attraction right next door when halloween season comes around.  What's great about this place is that year after year it stays consistent.  I've never had any issues with my food, never had a complaint about the service and I hope I never do.  They have the perfect location right at the center of Fremont in the Fremont Hub (which, I know literally means 'at the center').  You can't not order the molten lava cake when you come here. Even if you feel like you can't take another bite. The Molten Lava cake is a must. Oh, and I don't know how long the Honey Chipotle Chicken crisper has been on the menu but anytime you put chicken & waffles together I'm all over it!  Then, once you've dine, stroll over to Target or Marshalls to walk off all those calories. They're also located in the hub.

Really though - you have to ask for no added salt to some of their dishes. Sometimes service can be slow and sometimes service can be on point. You'll never know what you'll get! We came in when the dubs were playing the kings. Chilis has plenty of TVs, so no matter where you're sitting, you can see some game action. The bar can be packed if there is a game on though, but I like my comfy seats away from people #personalbubble There was a loud and large table next to us; we didn't mind because.. well, Chili's. And it's nice to be nice. On the other hand, the servers weren't too happy with the large table (on a slow Wednesday..). Well none of my business. Chili's is my rock - nothing will change and that's the way I like it. But change your tequila : margarita mix ratio because it hydrates me unfortunately. :x",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2

She is an extreme asset to this establishment.  Their chips and salsa are my favorite, super thin and not too salty! I tried their (what I would consider new since I haven't been here in a while) buffalo cauliflower! It was amazing! I'm slowing converting over to a vegetarian and this plate alone convinced me that I can do this.. I also have always been a fan of their chicken enchilada soup!  They've really upgraded their menu options and brought in a few new things which is a great change for them.  It's really hard for me to go out to eat sometimes with having a 2 almost 3 year old being very picky on who she interacts with and what she wants to eat. As soon as my daughter met Emily it was like she was her best friend. My step daughter really enjoyed her as a person as well. She even brought them ice cream :) Emily constantly checked back with us and reassured us if anything she'd be right here for anything we could need. It's rare to find a server whom is so punctual and attentive, as herself. I'd definitely come back and hopefully get to experience just as great service here again.

We waited over half an hour. The host kept telling us I'm sorry we are waiting for the previous party, we can't just kick them out. You could have told us a time frame....

We ordered margaritas and the server didn't even ask if we wanted them blended or on the rocks. As a result, we were served blended drinks (which is the default??).

My sisters and I went to this location for dinner, the hostess and waitresses were nice, we didn't have a problem with them. The management however, was so incredibly rude. I'm upset that we never caught his name. My sister brought her newborn baby to dinner with us in the car seat and stroller. The manager sat us a booth, no area available for us to scoot the stroller into. He immediately told my sister that she could not have her stroller and to take her seat out. My sister said she didn't feel comfortable placing her newborn on an uneven booth seat. She set her on the seat, the car seat did not fit. She turned and told him that she didn't feel comfortable AGAIN. He pulled the table out and her baby's seat dropped a few inches. This shook the baby and woke her up. My sister expressed that she'd feel much more comfortable at a table with chairs and the manager told her that he could not seat us there. We looked around, it was not crowded. There were two men in a six seater table right across from us. We didn't understand why he couldn't seat us elsewhere. My sister gave in and sat down with her child to calm her down. Throughout our evening, the manager would walk by and stare at her and her baby, every single time her walked passed or near our table. My sister felt uncomfortable and unwelcome.

Even though our waitress was great about coming by to check on us, it took another 14 - 16 minutes to get our appetizers. When they arrived my cheese was already cold and I had to chip it off the skillet , the fries were dry and the plate was not at a proper serving temperature. My counterparts platter had the cheese bites as well which were not warm either making them chewy and almost inedible. After about 10 minutes of trying to consume this inedible platter we requested the check to leave. I was utterly disappointed. Maybe some better teamwork, and better cooks would help. Most of the food smelled awesome but the end product we received was worse than lacking. If I had noticed someone that appeared to be a manager I would have stopped them to complain, but since I didn't I chalked this lesson up to NEVER EAT AT CHILIS AGAIN! The only saving grace was our awesome waitress who seemed quite overwhelmed. Will not return and would NEVER recommend anyone comes here either. Too bad the menu looked beautiful while reality was really ugly. Funny enough the place was packed when we left so maybe this was a isolated experience, but looking at the reviews, maybe not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=80
Justin L.,"Fremont, CA",17,5,,5.0,8/5/2015,"I am here to defend the greatest establishment erected on god's chosen parcel of land known as the Fremont Hub Chili's Bar & Grill. There are few pleasures in life quite like accumulating a massive amount of Chili's rewards points, a frosty beer, some happy hour apps, a waiter that stays out of your goddamned way and lets you watch the Sharks/A's/Warriors in peace. Shout out to my main man Jeff keeping the service real in the bar lounge - it is my hope that one day they promote you to Senior Vice President of Operations. I can't speak for the rest of the restaurant - never ate in there before. I frequent the bar area because I can't stand children and I'm an ogre troll who needs alcohol. So there's that. Consistency - there isn't a lot of consistency in this world. Yelp is filled with Bay-Area ""cultured"" snobs who sit behind a monitor and bitch about how their lava cake wasn't ""heated properly"". Unless you're the grandchild of Jean-Georges Vongerichten trust us all that your assessment of the proper technique in cooking a lava cake has fallen on deaf ears. If anyone comes on Yelp and decides I can't visit this establishment due to the ""lava cake review"" by [anonymous for prosperity's sake] then GOOD. Chili's doesn't need you - and I don't need you taking up the valuable seat real estate in the bar area. This is Chili's friends. This isn't Gary Danko. It's a little thing called southwestern eggrolls and a nice humble slice of life. That's all it ever will be. You're either down with it or not. Either move along and post your next riveting review of the Fremont Blvd. Kentucky Fried Chicken, or meet me at the bar. I'll be the one propped up on a pile of Chili's rewards points eating the triple dipper, watching the game and singing the songs of my ancestors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=80

Chantelina J.,"Fremont, CA",139,149,37,4.0,1/8/2016,"This location definitely stepped up its service from the last time I reviewed this place. I came here with my husband on Monday or Tuesday, I can't remember which. It wasn't busy, which is sort of a surprise because the Warriors game was on that night and I thought it'd be busier. Anyway, we ordered the 2 for $20 deal. For our appetizer, we got the deep fried pickles and for our 2 entrees, I got the 6 oz. sirloin (medium rare) with loaded mashed potatoes and black beans and my husband got the chicken and pork fajitas. I am REALLY digging the new menu! The deep fried pickles were SO good. I still prefer Buffalo Wild Wing's deep fried pickles, but I'd say Chili's takes 2nd place in my heart for it. I love pickles, if you couldn't tell lol. Chili's also improved their steak (at least I feel like they did) as far as taste and tenderness goes (I cut through the steak like butter, it was awesome). The loaded mash potatoes were a bit much because they put it in a mini skillet and I wasn't expecting it to be so heavy? But it was still pretty good and wasn't bland. Black beans were on point, as always. My husband DEFINITELY enjoyed his fajita dish. He used to work as a cook at Chipotle so he knows what fajitas are supposed to taste like and he was just like ""THIS is how you cook them. The cooks at Chipotle now just overcook them and it leaves a bad taste, but THIS is the one."" He definitely loved the pork more than the chicken, and I would have to agree on that. I tried the pork and it was full of flavor! Definitely going to get the fajitas next time we come by.

We were looking for somewhere that had a good grilled chicken salad and checked Chili's menu online.  The online menu listed one that sounded good but when we got there and read the actual menu, it turned out that there were several.  I can't remember the actual ""name"" of mine but it had marinated grilled chicken and a quesadilla came with it, quartered and decoratively arranged around the salad.  It was a good size salad, too, and was more than I could eat.  Hubby had a different grilled chicken salad but I think his was a Southwest Chicken Salad and there was a bit of spiciness to it (something I would hate but that he said was ""pretty good"").  Mine would have been spicy too if I hadn't asked to change to a simple Ranch dressing, etc.  They made my salad exactly the way I'd asked for it and that was nice.   The service was very good and our meals came out fast.  Our table had a mini-computer terminal on it (some tables didn't have this) so we were able to pay (and complete a questionnaire) electronically and quickly.   Overall, this was an excellent experience.  Not only was the food very good, the entire process from ordering to eating to paying our bill was as smooth as a finely tuned machine.

Last night - slow service, wish we could have had more refills on water, slow to bring our food out. We weren't in a rush so I didn't fuss. I ordered buffalo wings with extra sauce on the side (I like 'em saucey, like me) and they came with no sauce at all. Instead of taking them back she brought the sauce in little to go containers. Granted the probably would have just poured the sauce over like I did, but sometimes a girl likes the fantasy that these were made special.  I wanted to redeem my birthday cake reward and it took about 30 minutes to figure out the process - waitress said I had top order it from the tablet and I couldn't. No, I didn't have the coupon (and didn't need one, I had checked the email before I left from home), there is no wi-fi so my 4G was hella slow to show the email (yes, no coupon needed). The manager finally came and explained the process, I had to order it and she had to put the order in so then it could be subtracted at checkout. He really should have come a lot sooner, or the waitress could have asked him just to comp it, I had my ID and could have verified my bday. Waitress was ok nice, nothing great unfortunately.

We entered the restaurant 45 minutes before its closing time but we were not late. We ordered our food and as well as my friends food because we knew the restaurant was going to close soon. We got the food and everything but our friend still wasn't here. When he finally came, it was about 15 minutes before chili's closing time. But they wouldn't let our friend in. We even told them we are not going to order anything. We have everything we want. We had ordered his food too and it was getting cold. The manger was straight up rude and said I'm sorry I can't let him in. Again, the restaurant had not closed yet but the kitchen was closed.  Another incident happened when: I was having dinner with my sister's family. My sister had her 11 month old baby sitting on the table.

So finally after somebody tries to get our drink orders, we wait another approximately 50 minutes for waters again and drinks. no luck. Our waitress is helping other tables and now its getting a bit annoying. So now we tell the manager about the problem, only then the waitress pays attention. So later our appetizers come out with our dinner a long time later and my family wasn't so happy but of course I just took it like ""ok a miscommunication could happened, fine no problem"". But then our food was just horrid where some dishes were cold or had minor things like no sauce or was the wrong dish size (from a dinner entree to appetizer size). Now no problem we just asked her if she could get us sauce please and it took her 30 minutes just to get a sauce again. So later as we are still eating she comes and asks if we want dessert to some of my family which I didn't get because they are still eating? How would somebody order dessert if somebody its still eating the dinner and appetizers you recently brought out. At this point my family and I couldn't believe what was going on with this waitress.

Customer Service has always been something you felt more consistently at a higher standard here as well. Food is also A-Okay, and the service is usually relatively fast, and they usually make up for mistakes. I would be giving this four stars, but recent implementation of a 'Entertainment Screen', they have often charged us an extra dollar for using it, despite us never touching it. It's a pretty inaccurate system as if anyone toys with it before you're seated, it's assumed you're using it. This had occurred the last 4/4 times we've been here, so I felt that merited a -1 star.

Evelynn C.,"San Francisco, CA",827,366,884,2.0,10/22/2014,"I frequent restaurants like Chili's and Applebees since their food is pretty good and the price is fair for the most part. Last night, we went to this Chili's but service was really subpar. Our waitress took over 20 minutes to greet us, meanwhile all the other tables around us were being served/taken care of. When she finally took our order for the drinks, it took another 10ish minutes to get it.... and she left without taking our orders for another 10-15 minutes. It seemed most efficient/productive to me that she should have taken our orders while she was still at our table.. Right? Busy or not, at least put in our orders first so at least they can start making it! Finally after another 15 minutes, we got our food. There was no way to flag her down either since she walked by without ever looking at us. On top of all this, she even forgot to bring us one of the things we ordered... And then at the end, when we were paying our bill, she was suddenly friendly with us trying to get a good tip out of us.. We were all so baffled by her sudden change in attitude. Regardless of it all, we still tipped her the normal 15% because it was the right thing to do. (We sat on the right side of the restaurant, after entering, at a table near the window and our waitress was white) The food came out freshly made which is something I always appreciate, however the service really put a bad taste in my mouth.  Spinach artichoke dip is rreally good. Chicken tortilla soup is really good too. Southwest Chicken Soup wasn't great though, there was a ton of potato in my really small cup of soup and it eventually soaked up all the soup before I could finish it. Finally, the chicken enchiladas entree was good enough.. I've definitely had better.  For noticeably better service, I would probably go to Applebees since we can do most of our ordering from the little digital thing on our table.. As well as call our waiter/waitress with it.

Add to this the wait time. 2 hrs of total waste. I let it slide the first time it happened and came back again.but this time around it took these guys even longer. Certainly never coming back again.

Carly B.,"Fremont, CA",29,181,208,4.0,1/17/2016,"As far as chain restaurants go, Chilis is actually pretty good.  We hadn't been in years and couldn't pick a restaurant so we decided to come here. They have definitely modernized - TVs everywhere and mini tablets on every table. These were all a bit distracting so we pushed our tablet to the side. I could see it being good for watching a game though. They have a $20 dinner for 2 deal where you get an appetizer and each get an entree. Pretty good deal if you ask me. We got the chips and salsa (which were still bottomless in this deal to my delight), and the bacon burger and the carnitas fajitas. The fajitas were great and it was TONs of food. The burger was a good burger but you couldn't really taste the bacon.  Will definitely be coming back here to either watch a game or just when we have a craving for American food. Oh and their margaritas look amazing so I can't wait to try those either!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=60

Sam T.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/19/2016,"They only get one star, because I can't give them zeros stars. We walked in with a big party of 17, and asked if we could be seated. With a tiny bit over an hour before closing.To which the manager (a small thin older lady with glasses) said they couldn't sit us. They weren't busy, there was a lot or room throughout the whole restaurant. But they had already closed off 3/4 areas in the restaurant. I told the manager we were willing to split up in half, or in groups of 5 to make it easier for them to serve us. She again stated there was no room for us. And when I asked about the 3 empty areas in the restaurant with clean tables and why we couldn't sit there, she began to mumble and then nodded her head no. She then told me, there was just one section available for us to eat and it was full and she pointed at that area. I looked over and there were two small parties of 5 eating there. And 4 other tables that were covered in dirty cups, plates, and used napkins. The reason that area was full was because those tables had been left dirty and not cleaned for who knows how long. So we couldn't sit there or in any other area of the restaurant. We tried hard to work with her, but ultimately, she didn't want to serve us, nor tried to help. She was being lazy  She kept saying ""we weren't prepared"" that's what annoyed me so much. Because they could of been prepared had they cleaned up tables or allowed us to sit in a different section! Her lack of effort saddened me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=60

Morgan F.,"Fremont, CA",69,99,271,3.0,5/8/2015,"I need to give this place more credit than I ever have before. I have always hated chili's. The food was always crappy, the service was slow, and their drinks could have been sold as non alcoholic because they were so weak.  The last few times, though, chili's has really stepped it up. Their food has gotten so much better. Insanely better. It is actually edible without spending the whole next day or evening in the restroom. I applaud you, chili's.  Their service has been a bit better too. My service yesterday kinda stunk, but I feel like that always happens when you choose to sit in the bar area. The other sections seemed to have put some pep in their step. The bartender never seems to make it out to the table tops often enough. I suggest sitting at a table outside of that area. We got our food a bit cold, but because of what we ordered, it wasn't too bad. My buffalo boneless wings didn't have enough sauce on them...but the server brought me out an extra sauce for free, and that solved that problem.  While chili's is not my favorite by any means, I have it three stars because the quality of their food and menu items seemed to have gotten a bit better. I can definitely go back with less hesitation and think I'll find something I like!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=60
Daniel J.,"Newark, CA",114,15,13,2.0,3/27/2015,"This is a long review, but I think worthwhile to those who read it.  (I especially hope our server, Sophia, reads this...and the manager, Fariba.) My Wife and I walked in, there was no waiting. Friday at 0720. We were seated within 10 minutes, since we were a twosome, and had to wait for a two-top to get bussed. No problem. We were seated, and approached by our waitress, Sophia. I asked her some questions regarding the draught selection. I think I might have confused her, because 10 minutes later, our drinks came and I got a Sam Adams, instead of the Sierra Nevada I decided on. My Wife got her drink as ordered, and we were apologised to by Sophia for the time it took, and for her lack of knowledge regarding the beer selection. Not a problem, I can be a bit of a beer guy, and accepted I must have confused her. I decided to enjoy the Sam Adams she brought me, since I didn't want to wait another ten minutes. She proceeded to take our order, and everything was fine in my book. We received our appetizer, and were done and waiting for our menu order. Clock was about 35 minutes in from ordering. My Wife ordered carnitas/shrimp fajitas. I ordered steak/chicken. (I am uploading pics of my dish, to follow.) My Wife was brought her entree, with her tortillas. I was told by my server that the kitchen had made a mistake with my order, and were fixing it. Still, I was fine with that. By the time my order came out ten minutes later, I was disappointed at the dish placed in front of me, and that my tortillas were now dry/cold. My Wife was waiting, since my meal had not been brought out, but I convinced her to go eat without me. I looked at my meal, and asked a server for a menu. I took pictures at what I ordered, and what I received, looked at my Wife sadly, and told her I couldn't eat it. A few moments later, I asked Sophia to speak to the manager. I also told her that my initial drink order was wrong, and that we would like another round of drinks. I made sure to be clear on my drink order this time. My Wife had changed her selection, and I wanted the SN I had originally ordered. I want to say that Sophia had been every bit as helpful, apologetic, cordial, and customer service minded, as she could be. The manager, Fariba, came to our table, and asked me about my issues. I began by defending our server first. It was not her fault my dinner looked the way it did...I mentioned that I did NOT want to put our waitress on trial, and that my issues were likely training oriented, food management oriented, and that I couldn't even bring myself to eat it. Charred, burned chunks of meat. And not much meat, at that. A TOTAL misrepresentation of the menu. So...while I didn't want to butcher anyone in this review...I will say the following happened...I was given excuses. I was told by the manager that she ""knew right away by your complaint that Sophia doesn't know how to order drinks, and that you must be right."" I was told, ""Our food comes like that, and it won't always look like it does on the menu."" I explained that I have been to numerous Chilli's restaurants, and it didn't look like that ANYWHERE. That I didn't need to hear blame placed on someone else to validate my complaints regarding our meal. I explained that I thought Sophia did EVERYTHING she could to deal with a situation, with the UTMOST respect for customer service.  The manager, Fariba, struck our dinners from our bill. That was a VERY good thing. She continued by trying to give me excuses for everything, told me how bad our waitress was, how she didn't know a hefeweizen from a half glass of water, that their food was packaged a certain way that was out of their control, that our waitress had a DEATH in the family just yesterday...she really threw her under the bus, and unjustly so. When Fariba, (the manager) tried to square it, she made no offers initially, only asked me over and over what I wanted. I told her to be fair, and make ME, the customer, an offer to make it right. When she paid for our meal (not drinks, mind you, which were also wrong) she asked if there was anything else I wanted. I told her I did not want our server fired tonight, due to what happened, that it wasn't her fault, and in fact, I felt it to be the fault of management.  So, in the end, I ended up taking home a to-go box of food I didn't want to eat, and paid about half our bill. After the manager left, I told Sophia I thought she acted in a great way. I asked if I could use her name in my Yelp review. She said yes. I felt terrible for her. We offered our condolences and prayers for her loss. My Wife and I tipped 45% to her. She stood up higher than everyone we encountered tonight. Including her manager, though I was happy Fariba took the time to speak with us, I left feeling she said too many things. Personal things. Excuses. To anyone that is looking for a server, Sophia is your BEST option. God bless her!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=60

We were there to pick up a to-go order, and they locked the side door and gestured for us to go all the way around, then when we went around no one greeted us and a girl working there gave us a rude look, so we started walking towards the cash register to pick up and pay for our to-go order but that rude girl stopped us and said we needed to wait to be seated - we weren't trying to be seated we just wanted our to-go order. Then when we walked up to the cash register to pick up and pay for our order we had to wait like 10 min with no one coming to see us, so we asked to pick up our order and finally got it. Never coming here again. Also there was a guy who clearly wanted a to-go order right as we left, the guy working there at the side door gestured for him to go aroynd, so the guy who was going to order to go just decided to leave instead, he looked angrier than me, looks like I'm not the only one experiencing this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=120

My wife and I waited for 15 minutes and the staff didn't even look at us... as a matter of fact, there were no wait staff in site. It seemed like a ghost town. Maybe the staff was playing hide-in-seek with the customers. Because of this horrible show of customer service, my wife and I left, since Chilis clearly did not want our business. After leaving Chili's we drove to The Counter - a burger place on Paseo Padre Parkway and Walnut in Fremont. The customer service is much better than Chilis and the wait staff were happy to see us.

I barely sat down and he asks if I'm ready to order, ugggh no? There's s tablet device on the table that has games and you can order food. No one explained it to me.  I ordered a bottomless soup and salad and my son got a grilled cheese. It took 20+ minutes for our food to come out. The waiter never checked back or asked if I needed anything. I had to flag him down to get my next soup.  As for the food, the quality has gone down. The chicken tortilla soup looked like something out of a can or powder form. The chicken didn't taste fresh but frozen.  The ""new"" fresca salad was organic greens with quest fresco sprinkled on top, that was it.

I guess she went there and didn't know so she didn't get anything. So I requested it, both times, and nothing. Both of our servers had been rude and the first occasion on my mother's birthday she asked our server for a mojito. We didn't know they don't serve that there but he said ok.

I haven't been here since the latest redesign and it looks ok, a few more flat screen tv's to appeal to the sports fan and a new small computer device at each table which gives you the option to view your bill and pay with your gift card or credit card, split the bill with friends and a few other features that I didn't check out. Nice. Our waitress was helpful and friendly and took our order, me and my friend decided to get the 2 for $20 deal, a choice of one appetizer and two entrees.  Choose an appetizer: * Spiced Panko Onion Rings * Fried Cheese * Tostada Chips & Salsa * Tostada Chips & Fresh Guacamole * Half Order of Texas Cheese Fries Choose an entree: * NEW Fajitas (Choose Grilled Chicken and/or Pork Carnitas) * Half Rack of Baby Back Ribs w/ Homestyle Fries (Choose Original or Memphis Dry Rub) * Mango-Chile Tilapia (Lighter Choice) * Mango-Chile Chicken (Lighter Choice) * Grilled Chicken Salad (Lighter Choice) * Classic Bacon Burger * Cajun Chicken Pasta * Margarita Grilled Chicken (Lighter Choice) * 6 oz. Classic Sirloin* (Also Available as Lighter Choice) * Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadillas * Original Chicken Crispers® * Crispy Chicken Crispers® * Crispy Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers® We decided to get the spiced panko onion rings and each decided to get the Classic Sirloin, mine the 6 oz and my friend the 10 oz for $4 more For a Tuesday night, there were actually quite a few people dining out, but nothing like a weekend crowd that would be here. The kitchen seemed to be having troubles keeping up with orders because it seemed to have taken at least 15-20 min before our appetizer came out and another 10-15 min for our sirloin steaks. The onion rings were pretty good and served with a ranch dipping sauce. My sirloin steak, medium well was more well than medium and served with a side of steamed broccoli, cheesy mashed potatoes and a slice of buttered Texas toast. The toast seemed to be soaked in the butter garlic spread, maybe slightly more than I would put on.

Annie A.,"San Francisco, CA",329,285,689,2.0,8/28/2012,"This place sucks. The only reason we went was because we got a free chips and queso coupon just for signing up on their e-mail list. (Woohoo!)  The appetizer is normally 5 dollars and some change.  Even though it is good, I wouldn't pay that much for it; get the coupon instead.  The coupon does however require that you buy at least one entree with it.  It was about 930 when we got in, and the resto closes at 11.  The spot is remodeled, complete with new non-sticky, non-disgusting menus.  But don't judge a book by its cover.  We shared a burger, and got about 6 fries with it.  wtf.  but we figured it was because we got the free appetizer. fine then.  we requested ranch for all 6 of our fries, but the dressing was extremely watered down.  I was so thirsty from pigging out on all the salty food, but no water was to be found.  The employees are totally loud and lack professionalism as they tend to favor talking amongst each other in their loudest outside voice ever.   However, a plus was that when we ordered our burger medium  rare (bf likes his meat bloody), I didn't get the runs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=140

They were what I would expect from a restaurant that specializes in American food. However, our server spent far too much time standing around talking. And for a lunch hour, it took far too long for me to get my food. It took over 30 minutes for just the appetizer. And since I was limited on time, I had to take the rest of my meal to go. And when I finally got to finish my food away from the restaurant, I open my container to find that my order did not include everything that I asked and paid for.

But let me say the staff there was very unprofessional.. I saw waitress practically arguing. The manager didn't even act like a manager. Though our waitress was prompt and took very good care of us. It was other staff and their drama. They had friends eating there and would approach they're peers speaking poorly of other patrons as well as other staff. I went to dine with my husband & sister in law. Not to witness the bad girls club inside a chili's. On to the food my burger was dry. My sister in laws pasta was ohkay, but the chicken in it was whatever's.  Overall..I'm over it.

Lexie P.,"Fremont, CA",584,39,4,1.0,6/1/2015,"I honestly try to stay away from Chili's since I've had a handful of not so good experiences and last night wasn't any better. I had made a reservation for 7 at 7pm, expecting that by the time we arrive, our table would already be set up. When I told them about my reservation, it took them an extra 5-10 minutes to get us situated at a long, skinny table that could barely hold our entrees.  Since there were 7 of us, we ordered 3 ""2 for $20"" deals, while the odd man out ordered their own entree, the 6 oz steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. We liked the appetizers (chips & guac, chips & salsa, and the cheese fries) but the entrees were pretty bad. My cousin and her friend ordered the chicken strips which were mostly breading and little chicken. I ordered the cajun chicken pasta, which I honestly could have made better at home. My uncle was annoyed since he could barely eat his burger with little to no elbow room since he was sitting at the head of the table. The sitting arrangement was not well thought out. It might have been better for a party of 4 or 5 but not 7. As for my aunt, she absolutely hated her steak. She stated that the texture didn't even feel like meat. She described the taste as having the steak cooked in water then grilled, which makes it seem like it was packaged or frozen or reused.  I don't seem myself coming back here any time soon. The only reason why we went was because my uncle suggested it. I would've preferred Elephant Bar or Applebee's or BJ's and I'm a little disappointed that I didn't speak up earlier but it is what it is.

Libby T.,"Manteca, CA",1005,285,395,1.0,8/4/2013,"Epic fail.  We visited today following our trip to the Art & Wine Festival, thinking Chili's would be a nice cool place to grab a relaxing bite to eat for ourselves and the kids before we went home. WRONG. When you walk into Chili's, at most locations its a sure bet they always have a super friendly (almost to a fault) host/hostess greeting customers and seating them. Usually its the same here, until now I guess. We weren't greeted at all, and the gal hostessing seemed like she hates her job. No smile, no enthusiasm, not even a neat clean appearance... She was outright rude and dirty looking, and her award winning personality was just as fantastically drab.   Once we were seated, our server (Karla per our receipt) meandered over a few minutes later to take our drink order, however did not introduce herself and seemed already in a rush... Although they were noticeably not slammed. She then brought our drinks (mind you giving a 7-year old an adult sized Strawberry Lemonade, which I wouldn't have allowed) and took our food order. We had been outside in the sun at a festival for HOURS, so I called her over to request some additional waters and a refill on my sons drink. We sat. We sat more. For 8 minutes to be exact watching her chit chat in the take out area with other servers and hang near a table of guests in the corner. No drinks. Finally my husband asked her a 2nd time and she brought them, 11 minutes waiting. Food time - 21 minutes in. Entrées arrive and we ask for a few side items (mayo & ranch), and drink refills. Karla leaves again and never returns. My 7 year old is sitting waiting to eat but needs mayo for her burger.  My husband finally went up to get it himself and spoke with the manager. In the meantime Karla strolls by and says ""did you ask me for something, cause I forgot?"".  As we waited for the manager to bring the items over, the appropriate seating conscientious hostess seats an obviously drunken party of swearing yelling men next to us. Mind you there are plenty of tables open on the other side of the restaurant where they would have been no bother to anyone. I immediately have these guys pounding the table, slamming into the back of me and yell-talking because they are in party mode. My Autistic son has sensory needs, and I had about enough fun for one day. I spoke briefly with the manager, let my son finish eating, and I took him to the car. Neither of us could handle any more. My husband and daughter stayed behind to finish eating, talking to the manager and pay the bill. I never ate. My husband pointed out to the manager a few simple things. One of which was the fact that we have both been in the service/hospitality industries, and neither of us could fathom why a rowdy group like that would have been sat in the quietest part of the restaurant when they could have been sat in the bar or away from families dining?  And second, when did Chili's lower their standards of staff and training? Probably the worst service In years, I am sure their corporate wont care but I will complain to them as well. Although the manager did discount the ticket, that means nothing. Service like this is what causes chains to die. Good luck to them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=140
Shawn G.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2015,"Horrible! This is all I can say about this place. We go here quite frequently, and are almost always disappointed. Here's our experience from tonight: 1. We walk in around 8:30 pm. Place is mostly empty, but there is no one at the front to greet/seat you. Waited for 5+ minutes before someone showed up and took us to a table. 2. Floors were filthy as usual, but that's something we have come to accept at Chilis. They NEVER sweep their floors. 3. Appetizers arrived, but guess what. There was no silverware. And the plates were wet - really wet. Had to flag down the manager to get silverware and dry plates. Meanwhile, the appetizers were already cold. 4. While ordering, I had asked the server for extra plates (so our family could share the food), but there was no sign of any plates when the food came. Ask the guy who brought out the food (different person from our server) to get us some plates. 5 minutes later still no plates so I walked to the back to get some myself. Meanwhile the food is getting cold... 5. Need a refill on the water but our server hasn't shown herself since taking our order. So I tell the kids to just deal with it and wait until we get home. 6. Can't wait to get out of this place, so try to pull up the check on the little tablet/display they have on the tables. However, it was showing a completely different check (perhaps from the previous party at the table), so had to wait another 5+ minutes before I was able to flag down our server to get us our check. I am generally a good tipper, but this time I couldn't bring myself to leave a tip. Don't think we'll be going back, although I have said that before about this place.

Grietson N.,"Fremont, CA",1,40,,2.0,8/29/2014,"Got there around 4 p.m. on a Tuesday. There are no vegetarian choices in tacos, tostadas or fajitas, so my son ordered the chicken tostada with no chicken, only beans (which was already included on the tostada) and no tomatoes. First order was wrong - it had chicken and tomatoes on it. The server, who was not our waitress, should have read the ticket to ensure she was delivering the correct order.  We got a replacement order, which was correct, but had a short black hair on the plate, and what I thought would be whole black beans was a barely noticeable, watery film of what I assume was bean paste spread on the bottom of the tostada with everything layered on top.  We returned that plate and didn't try for a third time. Fries were old, cold, dry, stale. Got a fresh batch and they were better but not very good. The potatoes didn't taste or feel fresh. I had the mushroom swiss burger, ordered it rare. It was delicious and juicy and the patty was large and one inch tall.   Regarding the ambiance, the windows were very dirty. Greasy kids fingerprints on the inside of most of the windows in the booths facing the parking lot, and the outside of the windows were smeared and dirty. They are not high windows, so it wouldn't be difficult to clean reach over and clean them. The table next to us was leaving when we were being seated, and was not cleaned the whole time we were there. The table next to that one was dirty when we got there and wasn't cleaned either. There were no dirty plates on these tables, but there were crumbs and food particles all over them, with silverware strewn about.  Arguing in the kitchen, and everything that was said in the kitchen was heard across the restaurant. Employees walking past seated customers complaining about their aches and pains to someone halfway across the restaurant, in the kitchen. There was just a sense of most of the employees not really caring about their work or how their behavior was affecting the customers. Although the male host was very nice and cheerful and seated us right away. Our waitress, Sylvia, was excellent, I don't think we'll return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=140

Beef Rib enchiladas served lukewarm - declined altogether.  Women's bathroom smelled like pee. Papers strewn on floor & soap dispenser lid broken off, resting on counter.

I walk over to the kitchen area and what do I see? My fries sitting there. Why aren't they at my table? I'm already pissed because I knew I didn't even have time to eat. I tell them to give me boxes instead now that I'm out of time and literally within 2 minutes all my food comes out at once not even in the boxes but boxes on the side. Spent 25 dollars on food I didn't even get to enjoy til after work. don't go here if your short on time.

Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",293,689,138,1.0,7/1/2009,"I used to go to this Chili's all the time, when I lived in the area.... and they always had good service and decent food (for what it is)..... I went back last weekend, after a long day of shopping and was shocked to see how much the service has slid downhill. I don't know if the waitress we got is new, but she was AWFUL. She will go down in history as one of the worst waitresses I've ever had, anywhere. Here's a brief rundown: 1. Very slow to come take the order (during a not-super-busy time of day) and equally slow to check-in on us for the rest of the night. What would normally be a 45 minute meal took almost 2 hours, and only because she was painfully slow. 2. Our bottomless drinks were only refilled once, even though they were empty pretty much the entire time we were there -- and when she came to refill, she walked over with a pitcher of water and poured it into two glasses that were not formerly filled with water. WTF? 3. It took at least 30 mins after ordering for our APPETIZER to come out.... and when it came out, it was WRONG. At this point, we were starving and ate it anyway. By the time she realized her mistake, she acted like it was our fault and that she'd be doing this massive favor to us by not charging the extra $1 or whatever for the price difference. Um, no.. 4. When we finished eating, she came over with a bill and did not ask if we needed anything else or how things were. She was not into the customer service. 5. When we paid the bill, she rung it up completely wrong. She charged my card for 16 CENTS (aka her badge number or whatever) instead of the actual total, and obviously didn't even glance at the receipt before giving it to me to sign. I was nice enough to wait for her to come back (which took a good 10 minutes) and show her the mistake................ she went back to her manager to get the charge reversed and corrected and then charged me for the entire bill with ZERO discount or coupon or thank you for correcting the mistake. If I was like most people, I would have signed the receipt for 16 cents and walked out. I was shocked that they made no attempt to thank me for my honesty over HER mistake.  Totally lame service, and definitely the worst I've had at any Chili's... ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=180

The bacon came back just this side of burned. The waitress, who was very nice, accepted my cancellation of the order and the took a new order for some enchiladas.

Erin N.,"San Francisco, CA",76,38,17,4.0,7/4/2011,"I don't know if it's me but I seem to be getting the better end of service and food lately. Came here with an old  friend to catch up on life. First off, this place was not so desolate inside the restaurant as I thought it would be. It was okay for a sunday afternoon. Extremely easy to find parking. This place is attached to a dying hub of stores ergo this explains the emptiness. Our waitress was attentive, and cool. She brought out the food a little too quickly. She even apologized for it arriving late to our table? I know this is the opposite of what most people complain about. Perhaps, we eat too slow. I don't know but that was some really quick service. We ordered the: -Texas Cheese Fries ---(These are highly recommended and very delicious.) The cheese was not as melty but more dried when it arrived to our table.  -Crispy Chicken Chipotle Crispers - Always a classic chicken tender to order. It doesn't have a wow factor but satisfies the hunger quite well. -Chicken Fajitas---A build your own Fajita meal. You're given 3 small soft flour tortillas, a plate of guacamole, salsa, sour cream and a sizzling plate of sliced chicken breast mounted on a grilled green chiles and sauteed onions. The Freshness :)  I wishthe fajitas were already assembled so I could have just eaten it . I also wish there was more soft flour tortilla pieces. But I guess it's okay since you have the option of customizable fajitas.  --Molten Lava Cake -- I've read too many yelp reviews and the people are not kidding. This cake is heaven. It has a warm moist chocolate cake texture with melted chocolate flowing out of its center. The cake is topped with vanilla ice cream covered by a chocolate shell. All the while being surrounded in a drizzle of caramel. lmfao! This is sounding more like cake porn.  However intensely sweet the cake may sound--it is not. We were able to eat the entire cake without being bothered the light sweetness. The cake is pretty huge btw. Our bill came to  $26 before tip. Great Cheap Eats!!

Choices for Vegetarians: -Black Bean Burger (actually pretty good, but I easily tire of it). - Ceasar Salad (nothing special)  - NO SOUPS! Even the brocolli and cheese has bacon in it! - Nachos without the meat- essentially melted cheese on a chip for $8. YUM. - Some salad without the meat...lame. Seriously, it is really bad.

Kim W.,"Fremont, CA",22,66,10,1.0,8/31/2010,"Hubby & I went out for a late-ish lunch.  We both ordered the lunch express soup, house salad, and chips w/ salsa that has unlimited refills.  Hubby paid .60 extra to have the chili.  Chips/salsa came out pretty soon.  Chips are tasty but the salsa taste like a salty bottled salsa.  Oh well.  Salads showed up and they were your typical salad.  My hubby finished his salad way before the soups ever showed up.  Why weren't they served at the same time?  My guess was that they want to fill you up on the cheap chips and salad.  My hubby was VERY disappointed in the chili.  He was under the weather and had read the menu wrong (poor guy), but he was expecting chili with chunks of beef and beans.  Well this chili had no beans and a tiny bit of hamburger.  It was more a Mexican tomato soup...not chili.  When our server FINALLY drug his butt over to our table, my hubby asked for more chili but maybe with some more beef and beans this time.  Well the chili never came but the manager eventually showed up with an apology (of sorts).  Well it appears that Chili's chili is from a third party and comes in a bag.  Yummm.  No wonder they charge extra for it.  Oh and it doesn't have beans in it.  Maybe I just am unreasonable but if the name of your restaurant is CHILI'S, perhaps your CHILI is something you would be proud to serve.  They've got one large set of cajones charging you extra for that ""chili."" BTW - don't let them sit you with a server named Dane.  We rarely saw Dane.  I think I was invisible.  When we arrived, the hubby left to wash up so I was sitting by myself.  Dane didn't bother to make an appearance until AFTER hubby returned.  Hubby was unhappy with his chili and needed a drink refill...no Dane to be found.  I wanted more soup...no Dane.  Even when Dane managed to show up, hubby got a drink refill but I didn't.  I had an empty bowl of soup and salad but I wasn't asked if I needed anything.  We were in a hurry to get the hell out of there, so the bill was paid quickly.  After coming home I decided that Chili's corporate needed to hear about our wonderful dining experience.  I started looking at the receipt for the info they ask for and low and behold, I find that Dane had charged us incorrectly.  The manager deducted the chili/salad lunch, which we didn't ask for.  However, we were charge an additional $3.79 for a side house salad.  Explain to me how, if the server didn't have his head in the clouds, you would charge somebody for a side house salad when all they ordered was 2 drinks, and 2 bottomless soup & SALAD lunches.   It has been quite a while since I had been to Chili's.  As I told Chili's corporate, it will be even longer before I return.  I also mentioned that I would write a scathing Yelp review.  I hope I was scathing enough.   What a joke!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=240

When my boyfriend and I had gone out to dinner there, one of our favorite servers, Dane, was working. He always takes really good care of us and is really friendly.

Only reason why I'm even giving it 2 stars is because the food was decent, and our total bill came out to $21 because of the promotional menu they have right now. We waited 15 minutes for a table and saw a booth open up at the bar. The waitress came right away and took our drink orders, and 5 minutes later too our food order. She was really short and not very friendly or welcoming... (we over heard her saying one of her tables had just left with out paying their bill). Anyways, we waited for 35-45 minutes for our main dish to come out. Sometime inbetween that wait, a waiter/cook or some one came out and brought us some buffalo wings on the house. During this time, not once did our waitress come and ask if we needed anything or apologize for the long wait. We eventually got our food, had to ask for our dessert, had to ask for a box, and then she disappeared. Another waitress came by and gave us a check, but noticed we were charged for the wings... she came back 5 minutes later, said she'll talk to the manager. Waited another 5 minutes, drops off our check and we realize its some one elses check...wait another 5 minutes, tell her the problem once again, and then she gets our correct check.

First, we got seated next to a wall by the entry and being that it was already freezing outside we got to feel the coldness coming in through the outside windows.  They had the cold air running from their vents up so high that our heads were being blasted by the coldness from the start. When we asked if we could move our seats to a warmer location (table next door) our waitress said, there was no tables available.  That's because they were slow on cleaning up the 2 empty dirty tables. Our waitress, said they asked their manager to turn down the air, but it never happened.  Everyone, around us was bundled up wearing their jackets.  If we had gloves, we would have worn those to try and eat!   Finally, we were moved.   Next, came the appetizers. The guacamole was actually good, chunks of avocado with a good portion, however the chips were greasy and were basically broken small pieces.  We finally asked another server for a better basket of chips, which she complied  and brought with a smile...kuddos to this 2nd waitress. Our 2nd appetizer was tossed on our table by some other waiter who said, nothing after roughly throwing down the onion strings/fried jalapenos.   Don't order a cheeseburger or any hamburger at this location until they learn how to cook one correctly.  Usually, a burger from a Chili's restaurant is pretty decent and juicy.  I asked for medium rare, it came out well done and dry.  I did not ask them to redo it as I didn't want to get my next burger back with more attitude and a long wait time.  Our other diners had the quesadilla explosion salad, it was ""ok"" fair amount, but on the soggy side.  Cleaniness is in order for improvements on this restaurant.  There were used napkins, straws on the ground around our seating as well as surrounding areas on the way to the restrooms.  Management, is lacking here and needs great improvement for a Chili's environment.  Overall, if you want a good Chili's restaurant...try the location in Pleasanton, off of Hopyard it has never disappointed us!

Andrea F.,"Fremont, CA",16,21,7,1.0,6/15/2009,"Oh my! This place is really lousy and has gone downhill drastically over the last couple of years. We used to go there regularly...like twice a week sometimes. We don't go there anymore...here are the reasons why (I'm only listing problems we experienced multiple times):  1. Server doesn't come over to great us until we have been sitting in our booth for 5-10 minutes. 2. Servers and managers tend to sit in a corner booth and chat with each other while we and/or other patrons are waiting for drink refills, napkins, or food. 3. Food order has been screwed up or cooked wrong  (If I wanted raw fish, I would have hit a sushi bar) 4. Managers seem very disinterested in fixing any problems. 5. We have heard staff using cuss words in the kitchen area. 6. Two times...when I was picking up food to go, I saw a waiter pick up a french fry off of a plate and eat it, then take the plate out to a customer. 7. When the wait staff serves us, they seem like they would rather be with their coworkers chatting then earning their tip. That's it in a nutshell. Its really sad considering the low number of restaurants like these that are in Fremont. Now a days, you have to go to Union City or other places for this type of food. I've complained to their corporate office but no one does anything. They just don't seem to really care at this place. I've been to other Chili's (Monterey CA,  Houston Texas, Milipitas CA) and they are all so much better. The staff has a great attitude and the food is good. Why can't the Fremont grill step up to the plate???? Hey Corporate...PAY ATTENTION...FIX THE PROBLEM!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=280

Sandy N.,"Fremont, CA",37,232,181,4.0,3/10/2008,"We went yesterday, I got the new Triple the Cheese Big Mouth Burger. Yes it was big, but wasnt as good as the Smokehouse Bbq Burger. I think that is the best out of the 3. I recommend it and you will be stuffed after eating it. My son got the adult sized chicken fingers. I was expecting it to be breaded and fried, ya know how you get them everywhere. So they come out looking like fried fish nuggets. They were over breaded and kinda nasty. He wouldnt eat them and I didnt blame him. I took off the breading (Which it was soggy and greasy) and they were sorta slimy, yet fully cooked. Plus they put pepper on the corn on the cob and the fries - the waiter could have told me about the pepper, I dont know any kid that likes pepper.  Ive been going to this Chilis since I was a teenager and yes it has changed, the menu and the look of the place (seems like they took down all their flare that they used to have covering the walls, like Applebees) Still LOVE their chips and salsa.

K B.,"Fremont, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/18/2008,"So, I've been in the ""Tri-City"" area for a good 5 years now. Chili's has been a frequent dinner stop for my friends and I. I've never been super impressed with what you get there, but I have to say that over the 5 years I've been there it's gone down, down, down hill!  My last visit, two nights ago, led me to yelp. We sat down after a short wait for the table (nice). Waited a good 10 minutes until someone came to order our drinks. We finally put our order in after a good 20 minutes of sitting at our table.  The queso dip came....cold. 15 min later our dinner salads came. A bowl of mushy diced tomatoes and carotts...little lettuce.  The best part was the 45 minutes of waiting for our meals! There weren't many tables occupied but what was there were a couple large parties. LOUD! Always loud there!  Food came and we took one look at our plates and couldn't get a bite down. We sat so long waiting that we (two people) ate the whole queso appetizer! I was able to squeeze down one small fajita and called it quits. Then called over the manager. Her response was I'm so sorry...if you are waiting too long for food you can always feel free to stop someone walking by and ask about it. My friend chimed in...who has been walking by to ask? Really, there were 20 min periods with no waiter walking around on the floor. She comped our dinner plates and left us to pay for drinks, salads, and queso dip. Lame! Honestly it'll be a long while before I'm there again....and it seems when I do go back to places they're gone! Sizzler, Black Angus...what's next?

We walk through the door and there was no host at the desk. There were a bunch of guys in Chilis uniform sitting in the bar area chatting. After a lilttle while, one of the guys gets up, says hi to us, took us to our table and throws the menu on the table. We ignored his behaviour and requested if we could get a table near the window. He gave us a mean look, picks up the menu and just hands it to us and said go find a seat for yourselves and someone should be able to help you. Anyways, so we do find a seat for ourselves and then a girl comes in to take our orders. She asked us if we would like to start off with something to drink and we both ordered sodas. The sodas came in fast but the way it came in was inappropriate. The girl puts our soda on the table roughly while talking to another waitress and just walks off!!! After about 30 minutes, she comes back and takes our orders.The food came out pretty fast and it was actually good, hence the 1 star. So we are eating and then we are not even half way done eating, when the waitress got us the check and left it at the table without even asking us whether we needed something else and left. We waited another half an hour before we paid for the food and left so disappointed with the service and the attitudes of the staff. This was a wednesday and there were barely 12 people in the restaurant. I would have understood the stress if there were like a million people to serve at once. I have also filled in a customer survey online as indicated on the reciept and am yet to get a feedback.

Charmaine D.,"Mountain House, CA",213,146,39,5.0,8/11/2008,"Cool!  My first review.  (I can't actually believe I'm ""yelp""ing.) But I decided to yelp about (one of) my favorite places to eat around the Fremont area.  I like Chili's a lot.  Their service is nice, the place is clean and cozy but spacious.  The waiters are usually really nice and attentive to customers' needs.  I personally am not a fan of chocolate, but I know that their molten cake is very infamous around the area.  TRY IT if you like chocolate. Now, down to the food.  I consider myself a salad fan, but Chili's ceasar salad with lime-grilled shrimp has got to be the best salad I have ever eaten.  REALLY.  It is worth it to add the couple bucks for the shrimp.  Other than that, I also really like their steak (so yummy).  I always order their classic sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes (the pepper-gravy one is delish too) and corn on the cob (not listed as a side on the menu, but you can order it).  It comes with garlic bread too.  Yum!  So filling.  I can never finish the whole thing!  Other things on the menu that I recommend is the spinach and artichoke dip and the skillet queso. As for service, I have never really had a problem.  They're really nice about splitting up the check, say if you're eating with a bunch of friends and each person wants to pay their own share a different way, etc.  I have never had to wait a long time to be seated, and I've been here a LOT of times. Give this place a try.  Even if you don't like it as much as I love it, I'm sure that it'll be at least satisfactory, and well-priced for the amount and quality of food & service you get. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=220

He gives Kiely a $50 bill while asking if she had change for a 50 or if would have to pay in smaller bills. our total was $29.22. She comes and gives my fiance some money back. We assume it is our change so we take our to-go boxes and head out. A man comes our yelling at us saying "" hey are you gonna pay for your food?"" Along with him are 2 other employees. Confused, I tell him we just paid and for him to ask Kiely. Kiely comes out and says she gave us change for 50. Im thinking "" why would you give us change if we were ready to pay?"" They made some bs excuse about the misunderstanding and didn't give us our change when we repaid. Considering the fact that we are black, I don't know if there was some type of stereotypical thing, they assumed we were trying to eat and leave which we've never done. My fiance makes 21/hour and I make 14/hour, im pretty sure we can afford a 2 for 20 without even putting a dent in our wallet.

Katy W.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",57,422,75,3.0,1/16/2010,"2.5 stars, this review isn't just about Chili's specifically which is also probably a 3 star review, but about this particular Fremont location. Went on a somewhat gloomy Saturday with our friends and their baby. The place was pretty empty. The hostess was odd in that she addressed our party before two women who clearly had been there prior to us. I felt bad for them, but  it wasn't really our problem. Normally, I hate that attitude, but in this case, we wanted it to be low key with the baby so went ahead and took a table. Why did they seat us right between two other tables? Why not put us on an end table where we could disturb less people? The baby was very good, but she made gurgling noises and throaty notes of approval. Still the patrons next to us looked as though they were seated next to aliens. Sorry, but I don't consider Chili's at noon on a Saturday any kind of 'fine dining.' If this doesn't count as suitable for children, I'm not sure what else would. To compound this slight awkwardness, the server seemed slightly put off that our full attention was not on her and was instead on chatting amongst ourselves and catering to baby. I felt like she could have acknowledged our situation and proceeded accordingly. Instead, I caught her looking annoyed that we weren't attentive to her, ""do you have room for dessert?"" questions immediately. In short, Chili's did not seem very friendly nor did it seem terribly easy or good with children. (By the way, not being the proud parent of any children, I am new to this and curious-- who invented these 'sling' things?
