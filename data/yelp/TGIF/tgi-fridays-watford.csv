SJ F.,"Hillingdon, United Kingdom",11,116,,4.0,12/19/2010,"I went back.  I did!  I can't help it.   Sometimes a girl just wants free refills, and this is the place to go.  And since the last time my partner and I went, this location has improved enough that we've become regulars!  The staffing has gotten tons better, the food has gotten tons better, and overall we're actually really happy to see the brand (at least at this location) doing so much better than it has in the past!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watford
