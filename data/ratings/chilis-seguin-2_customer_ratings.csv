They are slow, very prone to getting your order wrong, just poor service and an unpleasant experience all around.

15,Christopher L.,"Seminole, FL",14,38,9.0,1.0,2013-08-21,This place should close. The doors were locked. We banged on door and employees looked at us.

19,Annika J.,"Fredericksburg, TX",1,6,2.0,1.0,2014-03-06,"To start off, it took a few minutes for someone to seat us, and when she did she just put the menus down and walked away, didn't say ""your waiter will be with you shortly"" or anything. At all. And she put us in the bar room where everyone but two or three people were at the bar, everyone else in the other room. Not to mention this seat is booming with sunshine and heat. Then our waiter comes to ask us our drinks, he was very nice and let me order first (chivalry). Then after waiting longer that usual I looked over at the bar, and he was talking to other employees. I kept looking over because I was like 'hello? Did you forget about us?' Finally he noticed me, picked up drinks that had obviously been made prior to me looking over and brought them to us- to no surprise they're flat Dr Peppers. And when he FINALLY took our order he didn't write anything down (didn't take our menus), but instead kept playing with and touching his big wad of cash. I watched him go to the kitchen to see how long he'd take to place our order but no- he stopped, talked to the employee again, and played with more money again. I have yet to post about our food but this dude needs to be fired. Pretty bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seguin-2?start=20,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
10,Shervin F.,"Sugar Land, TX",3,26,1.0,2.0,2015-06-04,kitchen was very slow to bring out the food. The burger was flavorless and unimpressive. Someone told me that Chili's actually has a good burger which is why I went and it validated why I don't go there but once every 5 - 10 years.  With all the specialty burger places around this a last choice. Stick to the one thing they do well which is the skillet queso.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seguin-2?start=20,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

12,Adam R.,"Flower Mound, TX",10,9,,1.0,2015-06-12,This was the worst Chili's location in the country by a mile! The service was atrocious and a total joke. We should have known when we all sat at the front of the restaurant without a host to seat us for 15 minutes. My mother ordered a 2nd beer with lime and received it 20 minutes later. The food was far from special and I'm sorry we ever thought we could celebrate a birthday dinner at a place like this.

7,Rachel E.,"Seguin, TX",50,16,16.0,3.0,2015-06-21,Well where do I begin...... We walked in and the host didn't great us or ask how of us there were. (It was only my husband and I) The host just walked off without saying a word to us. So someone else who was sweeping asked us how many and then were told to wait. We waited for 15 minutes. The host was never at the front. A family of about 5 walked in waited about 5 minutes but the host never came. So they left. As we were sitting there someone from the back came out and was counting all the tables that were dirty. He went back in the back and was yelling.  Finally the host came to seat us. Probably because I put my purse on my shoulder and got up and moved to the door. As we were following the host was passed up about 7 tables/booths that were clean and empty. When we sat down at the booth the table wasn't very clean. The host just left without saying anything.  On the bright side our waitress came to our table very fast and took our drink order when she came back we ordered chips and salsa. She came back very fast and we were ready to order. She checked on us often always making sure we had full glasses. She was friendly and good about making sure we had everything. The food was great. My husband ordered the classic sirloin. Lol he thought it was delicious. I got the chicken enchilada soup. It was so good.  We will probably be back but it might be awhile. They really need to get the host duties down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seguin-2?start=20,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005

Instead of getting the replacements done quickly, it took another 20 minutes. So basically 3 people finished their meals while 4 people finished there's much later. We called the manager over and he said he would look into things and he'd get back to us.  He didn't come back until we flagged him down.

I waited 15 more minutes to get my water. It was 10:10 when i got my dessert. Waited another 15 minutes before she came out. I never saw her working asking other tables. When she did all she did was chat instead of checking on other tables. I gave her my card and i didnt know it took almost 20 minutes to swipe a card. I left around 10:50.

Not much competition since the majority of chilis are sub par but this one really does a great job of always being pretty underwhelming.

First of all the service was SLOW. There were 6 in my party. 3 adults, 3 kids. This lunch lasted almost two and a half hours!!!!! Took a bit for the waitress to come by and take our drink order. Not a problem but didn't see our drinks for about 20 minutes and she said it was because they didn't have any clean glasses. Finally took our order about 25 minutes in. Asked for refills, another 29 minutes. Still not enough clean glasses. I can see why, there were tables that were not bussed almost the entire time we were there. Got our food over an hour after walking in. I ordered a triple dipper to share with my 2 kids, so not sure why that took so long. Other than that, my friends had two burgers and a child's pizza. Not very complicated. After waiting that long, the food wasn't even hot but at this point, just too exhausted to complain and extend this lunch any longer. At one point, the waitress even told us how she hated her job and had an interview soon!! So that sums it up!! My survey at the end of my meal did not go through.

We then order drinks and food all at once. Wait times were ridiculous even for a busy time. Queso came out ice cold, they take it to the back and bring it back boiling, hopefully not from the microwave. Tacos and beans ice cold and tasted old. Addressed the issues to the manager, he didn't really care. We wouldn't eat the tacos so he took the tacos off the bill. I could clearly go on. I'd avoid the place if I were you in my opinion.

They turned down a party of 6 in front of us because the size of the party was too big even though they literally had an entire section of tables open. There was still 45 minutes left before they closed.  2. No toilet paper in bathroom.  3. Ran out of Swedish Fish for the children's specialty drink and didn't offer a substitute.  4. When ordering desert, the ice cream machine was ""broken"" (or they had already cleaned it and didn't want to use it at the end of the evening).  5. We never received even one refill on my drinks.  6. Worst of all... they didn't allow me to use the kiosk to pay. This is because they didn't want me to take the survey and tell the staff what a terrible experience I had.   Lastly, I still tipped 15% become I believe this is a management problem not a waiter problem and I didn't want the waiter to bear the consequences of some serious management failures.

23,Robert V.,"St. Petersburg, FL",45,149,7.0,1.0,2017-08-03,"My wife and I have now been traveling for 19 days and have traveled about 4000 miles. The stop at this restaurant tops our list of the WORST that we have had in those 19 days/4000 miles. When we were seated the hostess first asked if the small booths would be okay - we declined. Then she offered us a small table for two that was nestled in the corner between two large and noisy groups. We asked if we could not have one of the tables around the corner where we could have some semblance of quiet and she said sure and she would get us a waitress right away. After a long wait, my wife told me what she desired to order and went to the restroom. More time expired and finally a waitress arrived to take our order. She first stated that she was sorry because no one knew that we were there. I said that was obvious and she stated: ""Oh, that is the way this is going to be!"" I ordered a diet coke, enchilada soup, and quesadillas for my wife. I asked for water, a bowl of chili, and the half turkey sandwich. My wife returned to the table. In a little while our drinks arrived and then my chili. My wife was told that her soup would be out shortly. My chili was a very thin gruel and not like any chili that I had ever received in any previous Chili's Restaurant and we are FREQUENT visitors to them. Nonetheless, I loaded it up with crackers and ate it all. It was also more spicy than any other chili that I had ever eaten in Chili's Restaurants. It was as if someone had added hot sauce to the chili as either a joke or ""payback"". We then received our quesadillas and the half sandwich. A group of 12 was then seated right behind us which amused us since we had really hoped to be in a relaxed area with little noise. However, that was not to be. Then my wife was told that the enchilada soup was not ready and it would be another 5 - 10 minutes. This was at 1:00 in the afternoon and it is a main staple of the lunch menu. She was offered another soup which she declined since she dislikes the chili and the loaded baked potato soups. She accepted a salad instead but really did not want it. While discussing the enchilada soup with the waitress, my wife discovered that the quesadillas were EXTREMELY greasy. Not mildly greasy. EXTREMELY greasy. Now everything was heading in the wrong direction. I offered to change with my wife (she has no gall bladder and cannot tolerate any greasy food). However, due to my medical conditions, she did not want me to eat them either. She was offered to have them redone, but she declined and asked for the same sandwich that I had. That was agreed upon and after the waitress left, I gave her my sandwich and finished my chili. The manager then brought out the other sandwich and apologized for the EXCESSIVE butter that the chef put on the quesadillas. She stated that they were oversaturated with butter. We ate our lunch and my wife did ask for and receive a refill on her diet coke. I would have liked to have had more water but was never offered that opportunity. We then got ready to pay the bill. I accessed the bill on the kiosk only to discover that I had been charged for the quesadillas and two sandwiches. We then tried to get the attention of either a waitress or manager to no avail. After waiting a long time, I once again tried the kiosk and discovered that the quesadillas had been removed from the bill. I then paid the bill and we departed. Subsequently I remembered that I failed to get my PLENTI points for our visit but that was my mistake for not taking the time to find how to secure my points via their kiosk system. The only thing that my wife got for lunch that she ordered was the diet coke. We found the food to be of questionable quality and the service to be unacceptable and mostly curt and almost rude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seguin-2,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
27,Susan T.,"Splendora, TX",0,11,,1.0,2017-08-22,"Just left and will never return. Waitress could've cared less. Actually acted like we were a bother. My daughter ordered  soup and salad. You'd think you could t screw that up. Wrong! She ordered the potato soup first. First bowl was ok. Second was a very odd color. Totally different consistency and tastes awful. The waitress said it was cold so she put water in it and microwaved it. So she asked for the tortilla soup and when she brought that you could have cut it with a knife. Then she said just bring me another salad. OMG what was in that salad? It looked like a long, hard piece of dried dog poop!! So disgusting. The waitress saw us find it and said "" I don't know what that is, we just open the bag. What???  She didn't even act like it was a big deal, at least fake it. She brought the check out and took it off. My daughter asked to talk to the manager. She said ""well he took it off do you still want to talk to him?""  We just paid and left!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seguin-2,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
