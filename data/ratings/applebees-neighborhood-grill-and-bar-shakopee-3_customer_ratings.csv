10,Lloyd M.,"Savage, MN",18,21,,1.0,2013-02-18,Worst Crapplebees I've ever been to hands down. In my 28 years of life I have only had worse service one time. And that time I never got served in over an hour!! Food is bad took over an hour to get food and everybody in the restaurant was getting a discount but us! This place is a nightmare. Horrible service and terrible management...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
11,Keith R.,"Shakopee, MN",3,12,3.0,4.0,2013-05-19,"I enjoy the staff and awesome happy hour, I generally sit at the bar and am served by Mark. Always get top notch service with a winning personality. Im sorry to the other reviewer who I encourage to revisit this cool place.Low key and fun",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
0,Dale O.,"Fargo, ND",0,4,,4.0,2013-06-21,"We came in on a Monday night and the place was surprisingly busy.  The service speed was pretty good, not overly fast, but about what was expected at a busy place.  We had our dinner in about 20 minutes from the time we walked in.  The server was very friendly.   I was pleasantly surprised with the food.  Casual dining chains typically have mediocre food at best.  But this is the first time I have been offered a temperature choice for my burger at an Applebee's.  They usually come cooked only one way: overdone.  My burger was pink and juicy and was the best Applebee's burger I have ever eaten.  For that, 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
7,Katharine C.,"Shakopee, MN",0,27,,1.0,2015-03-29,"It's Applebee's. I get it. If I wanted top notch service and quality, I should go to Murray's steakhouse.  But yeah, this was bad, even by Applebee's standards.  Ridiculously long wait for food. Kids burgers were rare (literally bleeding red rare), my burger had clearly been left on the grill for 40 min and charred to hockey puck status, and my husband's riblets were cold.  On the bright side, with the turnover I'm sure these places have in staff, you may have a far better experience.  But I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
8,Beth N.,"Shakopee, MN",6,31,32.0,2.0,2015-11-02,Food was good service was terrible! Sorry didn't get the name of the server but I will tell you that she yawned a big yawn when approaching our table. Went downhill from there with us barely seeing her rush by our table every so often. Others brought our food. Didn't see her until the bill came. We even ordered dessert on the electronic menu thing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
9,Muggsy S.,"Heidelberg, MN",11,5,,1.0,2016-07-06,"My children loved Apple bee's. They would ask every time we would eat out if we could go to Apple bee's but after our last meal at the Shakopee Apple bee's I doubt my kids will ever ask again. Not that I'm not glad about that because it's not my favorite place to eat. When we arrived we waited 5 minutes for anyone to knowledge us. I observed only one server on the floor and one entire section was full of dirty plates with no one in sight to clean it up. Once the only server on the floor acknowledged us he wondered out loud where the hostess went and said well I guess you will be sitting in my section since this one, looking at the dirty section isn't ready.  Once in his section the service was good but all four of our silverware sets were dirty and needed to be replaced not once but twice. I have to tell you this did not make me feel good about the dishes that were about to hold our lunch food. My youngest asked for a refill and a bigger cup since he was given a children's cup and when we got the bill I was billed for both his children's drink and an additional pop@ $2.59.Seriously? My son's burgers were under cooked with red in the middle which is gross and my entire meal was one big pile of cheese on a tortilla. I barely ate due to the silverware incident earlier. I just couldn't get it out of my head and my entree looked and tasted badly. The four of us at for $72.00. I was shocked when I got the bill. My mother had a salad, my two kids had meals off the kids menu and I had a steak quesadilla. How the hell should that = 72.00?? I checked the bill to make sure there was no mistake on their end. Nope, it was just the out holy shit prices for mediocre food. We will not be frequenting this  Apple bees again. I would not recommend it to anyone! Go elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
4,Garrett Z.,"Apple Valley, MN",106,335,536.0,2.0,2016-07-19,"Eh, it's Applebees. We usually come here for 1/2 priced apps and nothing more. We met my wife's family here for a few quick drinks and bites to eat and frankly that is what we got. Our waiter was MIA for most of the time, so when he did appear we had a list of refills and such to give him. So yeah....way to be mediocre bees...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
5,Katie R.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,8,2.0,1.0,2016-08-07,"Like everyone else has said this is an Applebee's, nothing fancy, but this was bad for even Applebee's standards.  My husband and I stopped in for a quick dinner.  Service was fine. Music seemed a lot louder then normal. We got our usual 2 for $25, each getting the steak.  I get my medium rare but it came out overdone.  Asked for mixed veggies and got 2 big chunks of zucchini (when did that change from broccoli and carrots). I think they forgot to put sugar in the lemonade (overly sour and could not drink).  Our server was very friendly and got my steak fixed right away but the food was still below what we normally get from an Applebees. I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
6,Jeff H.,"Saint Peter, MN",0,2,1.0,4.0,2017-03-02,Applebees is a great pit stop off 169.  Just like what you'd expect at every other Applebees in Minnesota. Staff is nice but not over the top (which is a good thing).  Tall beers at a decent price. Safe place to have a good meal.  If you're looking for fancy go to O'Briens. Looking for good BBQ go to Mr. Pig Stuff. Looking for somewhere with a little more authenticity try Dangerfields.  Looking for something away from everything try the Lion's Tap.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
2,Neil J.,"Northwest, Denver, CO",232,3,3.0,5.0,2017-07-09,Great happy hour specials. They make an extra effort here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
3,Taiga A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,,3.0,2017-07-14,This was a pretty good experience. The food was pretty good except that that the waiter got our order wrong the appetizers came really fast and the blue cheese sauce is fantastic. The food is 3 and a 1/2 stars. The service was terrible our qaiter was blind or deaf I was waving my hands right in front of her and she walked by. Another waiter had to come and help our table out. Overall 3 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
1,Phil S.,"Lakeville, MN",6,6,,1.0,2017-12-14,Went there for lunch really kind of nasty. The employees acted like the customers were a pain in the ass. The food was OK but kind of expensive. It's all right if you want an upgraded McDonald's,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-shakopee-3,,,,,
