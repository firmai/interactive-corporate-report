Arnab D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",91,87,457,3.0,12/21/2012,"Three stars for the good food. Very slow service. We had to wait 15 minutes to enter half empty restaurant. 50 minutes from order to receiving the food. 2 minutes before our food arrived, our server realized we can do with some bread and butter. Three pieces roughly sliced reached was after almost 50 minutes. Not that the restaurant was full.  But again, the pizza was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon?start=20
Carlos H.,"Tampa, FL",3388,793,1522,2.0,12/9/2007,"Let's face it folks, dining is about service, you go there to eat, but you also go there to have a good time. I planned to have my 18th birthday dinner at the California Pizza Kitchen. I had lots of friends say there were going to show up, and so I tried to reserve a big table, and for the most part the CPK was very responsive and nice about it. Until I actually showed up. Some people didn't come, or kept saying there were coming but didn't. And the management hassled me everyone couple of minutes asking if the whole party was going to arrive soon. I eventually figured out they wanted tables and told them to just take them, and some of the hassling stopped. I understand they need the tables for business, but if they really weren't supposed to sit people without their party, I would have been happy dividing my party to avoid the hassling. And on my birthday only annoys me more. But even the waiter was still ridiculously rude to my party. He claims they have a company policy that doesn't allow them to sing happy birthday or do anything for anyones birthday. Clearly this was a lie, because at the front, the hostess was telling me about a fudge cake I would get since it was my birthday, and then he had THE NERVE to come up to us and ask me if I wanted to BUY desert from them...for my birthday. Okay....NO. I don't know if he had ants in his pants or something, but he would stroll by every two to three minutes and ask how everything was doing, like he didn't have other customers to deal with, and even when he came he didn't pick up your drink for a refill, up to twenty minutes after it was empty. It was a horrible experience for me to spend, and even wasn't completely their fault, since I did have party cancellations, they didn't have to react the way they did, and I still ordered so much food that it's not like the waiter and restaurant didn't make a pile of money off my party and myself. If there's anything saving this place from one star it has to be that the food was still amazingly good, and that is about it. Restaurants can't just live off of good food though, they have to keep good clients and reputations to keep business going, and if I ever want to eat California Pizza Kitchen again in Brandon, I swear I will instead take it to go and just leave, screw the service there out of tips, and I will be sure to review them where ever I have an account to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon?start=20
Roger R.,"Arcadia, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/31/2013,"Food was average, the drink was nothing but sweet, the wait was long, and they only gave 90 min for your parking even though you were asked to wait for 30+ min.   Worst part, there was some unconventional company policy that won't allow them to sing happy birthday song to your child!

Joel C.,"Troutville, VA",16,55,19,3.0,7/6/2012,"Typical CPK. Good food.  CPK's consistency across multiple locations is impressive. They recently added a new pizza, the Habanero Carnitas. I've had it the last two times now. I love it. We came at a slow time of day. The service was adequate. It did take a while for our meal to arrive which made me wonder how long it takes on a busy day. Based on other reviews it appears that service is an issue for this location.The bathrooms were very clean.

Aimee B.,"Austin, TX",226,185,49,3.0,7/31/2011,"The service was slow, but they did take initiative in bringing us drinks when they were low. However, we were there at a time when the restaurant was nearly EMPTY and the service was still slow... what gives, guys? Something going on in the back we need to know about? Anyway, the food was delicious. We were ravenous going in, so I'm sure any food would've tasted good. But what we ordered was just awesome! We got the spinach dip as an appetizer, and both ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. It was delicious. The pizza was too large to finish in one sitting, so I had the rest the next day; good news - it reheats well!

Stephen B.,"Tampa, FL",2,29,14,1.0,9/11/2013,Just awful. Walked in to a mostly empty restaurant at around 8:00 pm. Waitress ignored us. We got the message. They were just too busy with maybe four tables in the restaurant to even get our drink order. We walked out and went across the walk to The Cheesecake Factory.

Meg B.,"Aiken, SC",5,58,2,2.0,1/29/2010,"Went here with a friend of mine from work after they opened up. I should have known the experience couldn't be too great when she said she wanted to swing by and complain about a to-go order she did. The manager was gracious and apologetic about the issue and offered to comp lunch for the two of us even though it was only a take out order my friend had gotten alone. We had her small son with us and the waitress was nice about bringing some crackers and stuff for him to snack on so he wouldn't be fussy. We ordered a chicken and spinach alfredo pizza that was very good but took an INSANE amount of time to come out. I'm seriously talking like 40 minutes during a not so busy lunch time in the middle of the week. We decided to order a dessert to split between ourselves and the baby and pay for it. She explained to the waitress that the manager had offered to comp our meal and drinks and that we wanted to order dessert on our own dime. The dessert was good but again took a ridiculous amount of time to come out. The waitress took forever to bring the bill and when she did was trying to charge the full bill. My friend had to call the waitress over and ask about it and the waitress was suddenly acting like she didn't have any clue about the pizza and drinks being comped. She called over a rather cranky woman who was supposedly also a manager and treated us very poorly. She was very accusatory and acted as though we were lying and trying to get out of a bill. Eventually we spotted the original manager who comped the meal and called him over (the waitress and female manager kept acting like they didn't know who we were talking about when we described the manager who offered the comp meal) The original manager ended up being the one who straightened out the issue for us and he comped the dessert we ordered because of the hassle we were given over the bill. Needless to say, even though the food was great, I wouldn't go back again for such poor customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon?start=40
Kimberly P.,"Orlando, FL",85,127,238,5.0,10/19/2015,"This was my first time dining at this location. I have eaten at cpk many times, but it had been over a year.    It was a beautiful day so we decided to sit on the patio. Our waitress was crystal and she was very attentive, knowledgeable and was always smiling. I started with the citrus adobo Margarita... It was Awesome and had a little spicy, zesty flavor to it. For apps we had the Spinach dip along with the California egg rolls... My boyfriend loved the dip but enough to go along with the chips would have been nice. They had some new menu items so I decided to give the shrimp scampi pizza a go, my bf got the pepperoni mushroom, and my son had the original barbecue chicken pizza... We ate so freaking much but decided since we were already being fatties thst we would go for desert. I was trying to convince my bf to get the butter cake but he was stuck on trying the pumpkin cheesecake while my son went for the sea salt caramel... omg the butter cake is soooo delicious and goes well with the ice cream... I ate half and gave the other half to my bf. He thought that both were super delicious,  but agreed that the butter cake was better. I like this location better than international bc you don't have shoppers staring at you while your eating, The Management is alot friendlier ( Ask for Jonathan... He's awesome), At international my service was slower and my table was forgotten a couple of times. .. ALSO one thing I like better about the Brandon location is their patio isn't near a dumpster so you can enjoy your meal without the smell of garbage. I will definitely be back to this location. The prices weren't bad... Tip and all I think we paid $130.00...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon
Ashley P.,"Tampa, FL",117,119,347,4.0,11/27/2016,"Yum! Decided to check out the Brandon location while shopping. I like that the Westfield Brandon mall has several actual restaurants attached to the mall so you don't have to choose food court food or get in the car to go get food. We were quickly greeted and seated when we arrived and were given a booth in the corner by the takeout door. We had a stroller with us and needed a high chair so the extra room was appreciated, but we felt in the way when people actually came in through that door. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos which were delicious. The kids' pasta meals were also surprisingly good! I've become accustomed to not expect much from kids meals and they exceeded my expectation with the alfredo and mac n cheese. I was happy to find that they had SO much more than just pizza. I would definitely recommend this restaurant as well as this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon
Bill B.,"Lithia, FL",308,140,127,4.0,8/12/2015,"OK, I'm not normally one for chain restaurants, but my two young sons (5 and 3) wanted pizza and we were already at the mall. I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I had the California pizza (I think that's what it was called) and the boyz had Mac and cheese and a kids cheese pizza.  The California pizza was amazing - chicken, bacon, avocado, and arugula on top of a pizza, awesome!  The boys Mac and cheese was a letdown - it tasted like something frozen and heated in the microwave. The cheese pizza they got was also good. The waiter, Igor, was great with my boys and provided us with great service. If we go back I will ask to be seated in his section.  Great selection of pizzas and not a bad beer/drink selection. I can't wait to try the habanero pizza next!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon

Having said that, everything we've had here has been decent, I can't remember having anything too terrible here. But I also have never been wowed.

Chris T.,"Brandon, FL",472,44,61,4.0,5/30/2015,"I avoid the Brandon Mall if at all possible, but a group of 25 of us went here after a meeting, for dinner. Because all of us shared food, I ate 4 different kinds of pizza, plus my Thai Chicken Salad w/peanut sauce that was outstanding. They had 3 different wait people serve us, and 23 out of 25 of us got outstanding service. But somehow, 2 of our group's orders got messed up, and they were served late, after everyone was finished eating. The manager refused to charge them, apologized profusely, and then gave the entire table free meal cards, to be used at a future date! Because this place is at Brandon Mall, I am unlikely to go back, unless a group of us goes again.

Scott H.,"Clearwater, FL",129,187,230,3.0,12/1/2013,"Since I had been visiting the International Plaza for several weeks now I had been wanting to try the California Pizza Kitchen. This location is not in the food court or in the Bay Street area; it is on the lower level next to Nordstroms.  I will have to say from the outside looking in it looks a lot smaller than it really is.  The setting is mostly booths suitable for a long narrow restaurant with a counter area that seats maybe 8 to 10 people.  The counter was extra helpful to me because there was a line for regular seating and the counter had available spots.  I find this as one of the benefits to dining alone when eating near an open kitchen likes this does take the edge of not having a conversation going. Sometimes my moods are kid like so I was really wanting just basic spaghetti and meat sauce with mushrooms added.  So I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese which was the outstanding part of my experience.  The noodles were al dente perfection holding a nice but delicate firmness.  The sauce had a composition balancing between the meat and the tomato not letting one over power the other.  The sauce was very hardy and leaned toward a peppery flavor (not a fan of the sweet sauces); with the hefty sliced mushrooms topped with parmesan and parsley my desire was being fulfilled. They offered a selection wine and beer.  I was impressed that my Guiness came in a 20oz bottle and I did not have to ask for a glass.  I did have to ask the waitress to open the bottle after trying to operate it like a twist off only to realize that it required a bottle opener; this and I had to ask for flatware were my only negative takes. I did notice a great deal of kids, after noticing some of the dishes I could see why, they looked very good especially the mac n cheese looking dish. If you are planning a trip to the mall and don't want to eat in the food court this is a great place for the entire family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon

Nicole F.,"Tampa, FL",119,367,1161,2.0,11/8/2015,"I am having to write another review because I was really disappointed with my dining experience this time. It mostly had to do with the service here and not so much the food. I came here with my mom and two children, and as we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess who insisted on using the word ""guys"" as she said hello. ""Hi guys!"" ""Right this way guys"", ""Alexis will be your server and she will be right with you guys"". Seriously??!!  She said it so many times that I almost wanted to ask her not to address ANYONE like that ever again. I would expect to hear it at Hooters, but not at a CPK.      Once our server came, she greeted us in a nice manner and was prompt at bringing us our drinks. I don't like to nit pick, but I was a server for a few years at a mid end restaurant and I know how to wait on tables. If I have to constantly ask for refills, there is already an issue. My iced tea did not have any ice cubes, even though everyone else's did. Three times I had to ask for refills and I even stacked one glass in another for her to pre-bus the table....You would think that after she brings me another tea, my third one, that she would take the empty glasses from our table. Nope. Once we finished our appetizer, she came and took our plates but NOT the empty piled up glasses!!! I had to ask her to remove them and for another refill. We got our bread and did not get our small plates to put our individual pieces of bread on. Who wants to eat with bread crumbs all over the table?       My mom and I even noticed that the table across from us had ordered the egg rolls and had to ask for small plates as well. That should be brought to the table automatically when bringing any sort of appetizer unless you are eating it by yourself. Our food was pretty good as usual, but the kitchen staff forgot to put the goat cheese in my salad so I had to ask for it.       Bottom line is, server training before they get to the floor by themselves needs to be in full effect and please....don't ever call any women ""guys"" when you are greeting female customers. It's not a wings/burger joint/bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon

Kimberly P.,"Orlando, United States",85,127,238,5.0,19/10/2015,"This was my first time dining at this location. I have eaten at cpk many times, but it had been over a year.    It was a beautiful day so we decided to sit on the patio. Our waitress was crystal and she was very attentive, knowledgeable and was always smiling. I started with the citrus adobo Margarita... It was Awesome and had a little spicy, zesty flavor to it. For apps we had the Spinach dip along with the California egg rolls... My boyfriend loved the dip but enough to go along with the chips would have been nice. They had some new menu items so I decided to give the shrimp scampi pizza a go, my bf got the pepperoni mushroom, and my son had the original barbecue chicken pizza... We ate so freaking much but decided since we were already being fatties thst we would go for desert. I was trying to convince my bf to get the butter cake but he was stuck on trying the pumpkin cheesecake while my son went for the sea salt caramel... omg the butter cake is soooo delicious and goes well with the ice cream... I ate half and gave the other half to my bf. He thought that both were super delicious,  but agreed that the butter cake was better. I like this location better than international bc you don't have shoppers staring at you while your eating, The Management is alot friendlier ( Ask for Jonathan... He's awesome), At international my service was slower and my table was forgotten a couple of times. .. ALSO one thing I like better about the Brandon location is their patio isn't near a dumpster so you can enjoy your meal without the smell of garbage. I will definitely be back to this location. The prices weren't bad... Tip and all I think we paid $130.00...",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon

I like that the Westfield Brandon mall has several actual restaurants attached to the mall so you don't have to choose food court food or get in the car to go get food. We were quickly greeted and seated when we arrived and were given a booth in the corner by the takeout door. We had a stroller with us and needed a high chair so the extra room was appreciated, but we felt in the way when people actually came in through that door. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos which were delicious. The kids' pasta meals were also surprisingly good! I've become accustomed to not expect much from kids meals and they exceeded my expectation with the alfredo and mac n cheese. I was happy to find that they had SO much more than just pizza.

The California pizza was amazing - chicken, bacon, avocado, and arugula on top of a pizza, awesome!  The boys Mac and cheese was a letdown - it tasted like something frozen and heated in the microwave. The cheese pizza they got was also good. The waiter, Igor, was great with my boys and provided us with great service. If we go back I will ask to be seated in his section.

Chris T.,"Brandon, United States",472,44,61,4.0,30/5/2015,"I avoid the Brandon Mall if at all possible, but a group of 25 of us went here after a meeting, for dinner. Because all of us shared food, I ate 4 different kinds of pizza, plus my Thai Chicken Salad w/peanut sauce that was outstanding. They had 3 different wait people serve us, and 23 out of 25 of us got outstanding service. But somehow, 2 of our group's orders got messed up, and they were served late, after everyone was finished eating. The manager refused to charge them, apologized profusely, and then gave the entire table free meal cards, to be used at a future date! Because this place is at Brandon Mall, I am unlikely to go back, unless a group of us goes again. But if I ever find one of these places, in a non shopping mall environment, I would be likely to go to a California Pizza Kitchen again.

Scott H.,"Clearwater, United States",129,187,230,3.0,1/12/2013,"Since I had been visiting the International Plaza for several weeks now I had been wanting to try the California Pizza Kitchen. This location is not in the food court or in the Bay Street area; it is on the lower level next to Nordstroms.  I will have to say from the outside looking in it looks a lot smaller than it really is.  The setting is mostly booths suitable for a long narrow restaurant with a counter area that seats maybe 8 to 10 people.  The counter was extra helpful to me because there was a line for regular seating and the counter had available spots.  I find this as one of the benefits to dining alone when eating near an open kitchen likes this does take the edge of not having a conversation going. Sometimes my moods are kid like so I was really wanting just basic spaghetti and meat sauce with mushrooms added.  So I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese which was the outstanding part of my experience.  The noodles were al dente perfection holding a nice but delicate firmness.  The sauce had a composition balancing between the meat and the tomato not letting one over power the other.  The sauce was very hardy and leaned toward a peppery flavor (not a fan of the sweet sauces); with the hefty sliced mushrooms topped with parmesan and parsley my desire was being fulfilled. They offered a selection wine and beer.  I was impressed that my Guiness came in a 20oz bottle and I did not have to ask for a glass.  I did have to ask the waitress to open the bottle after trying to operate it like a twist off only to realize that it required a bottle opener; this and I had to ask for flatware were my only negative takes. I did notice a great deal of kids, after noticing some of the dishes I could see why, they looked very good especially the mac n cheese looking dish. If you are planning a trip to the mall and don't want to eat in the food court this is a great place for the entire family.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon

Nicole F.,"Tampa, United States",119,367,1161,2.0,8/11/2015,"I am having to write another review because I was really disappointed with my dining experience this time. It mostly had to do with the service here and not so much the food. I came here with my mom and two children, and as we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess who insisted on using the word ""guys"" as she said hello. ""Hi guys!"" ""Right this way guys"", ""Alexis will be your server and she will be right with you guys"". Seriously??!!  She said it so many times that I almost wanted to ask her not to address ANYONE like that ever again. I would expect to hear it at Hooters, but not at a CPK.      Once our server came, she greeted us in a nice manner and was prompt at bringing us our drinks. I don't like to nit pick, but I was a server for a few years at a mid end restaurant and I know how to wait on tables. If I have to constantly ask for refills, there is already an issue. My iced tea did not have any ice cubes, even though everyone else's did. Three times I had to ask for refills and I even stacked one glass in another for her to pre-bus the table....You would think that after she brings me another tea, my third one, that she would take the empty glasses from our table. Nope. Once we finished our appetizer, she came and took our plates but NOT the empty piled up glasses!!! I had to ask her to remove them and for another refill. We got our bread and did not get our small plates to put our individual pieces of bread on. Who wants to eat with bread crumbs all over the table?       My mom and I even noticed that the table across from us had ordered the egg rolls and had to ask for small plates as well. That should be brought to the table automatically when bringing any sort of appetizer unless you are eating it by yourself. Our food was pretty good as usual, but the kitchen staff forgot to put the goat cheese in my salad so I had to ask for it.       Bottom line is, server training before they get to the floor by themselves needs to be in full effect and please....don't ever call any women ""guys"" when you are greeting female customers.

I planned to have my 18th birthday dinner at the California Pizza Kitchen. I had lots of friends say there were going to show up, and so I tried to reserve a big table, and for the most part the CPK was very responsive and nice about it. Until I actually showed up. Some people didn't come, or kept saying there were coming but didn't. And the management hassled me everyone couple of minutes asking if the whole party was going to arrive soon. I eventually figured out they wanted tables and told them to just take them, and some of the hassling stopped. I understand they need the tables for business, but if they really weren't supposed to sit people without their party, I would have been happy dividing my party to avoid the hassling. And on my birthday only annoys me more. But even the waiter was still ridiculously rude to my party. He claims they have a company policy that doesn't allow them to sing happy birthday or do anything for anyones birthday. Clearly this was a lie, because at the front, the hostess was telling me about a fudge cake I would get since it was my birthday, and then he had THE NERVE to come up to us and ask me if I wanted to BUY desert from them...for my birthday. Okay....NO. I don't know if he had ants in his pants or something, but he would stroll by every two to three minutes and ask how everything was doing, like he didn't have other customers to deal with, and even when he came he didn't pick up your drink for a refill, up to twenty minutes after it was empty. It was a horrible experience for me to spend, and even wasn't completely their fault, since I did have party cancellations, they didn't have to react the way they did, and I still ordered so much food that it's not like the waiter and restaurant didn't make a pile of money off my party and myself. If there's anything saving this place from one star it has to be that the food was still amazingly good, and that is about it. Restaurants can't just live off of good food though, they have to keep good clients and reputations to keep business going, and if I ever want to eat California Pizza Kitchen again in Brandon, I swear I will instead take it to go and just leave, screw the service there out of tips, and I will be sure to review them where ever I have an account to do so.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon?start=20

I'm seriously talking like 40 minutes during a not so busy lunch time in the middle of the week. We decided to order a dessert to split between ourselves and the baby and pay for it. She explained to the waitress that the manager had offered to comp our meal and drinks and that we wanted to order dessert on our own dime. The dessert was good but again took a ridiculous amount of time to come out. The waitress took forever to bring the bill and when she did was trying to charge the full bill. My friend had to call the waitress over and ask about it and the waitress was suddenly acting like she didn't have any clue about the pizza and drinks being comped. She called over a rather cranky woman who was supposedly also a manager and treated us very poorly. She was very accusatory and acted as though we were lying and trying to get out of a bill. Eventually we spotted the original manager who comped the meal and called him over (the waitress and female manager kept acting like they didn't know who we were talking about when we described the manager who offered the comp meal) The original manager ended up being the one who straightened out the issue for us and he comped the dessert we ordered because of the hassle we were given over the bill. Needless to say, even though the food was great, I wouldn't go back again for such poor customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-brandon?start=40
