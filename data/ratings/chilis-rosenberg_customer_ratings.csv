52,Dottie H.,"Rosenberg, TX",2,68,,4.0,2013-02-10,"I lived in Sugar Land for 35 years. The Chili's in SL has consistently gone downhill, so much that we would not go there. Service was just dreadful and very slow (if you could get a waiter at all), orders mixed up. Poor manager. This one in Rosenberg, however, rocks. Service is fantastic, waiters friendly and caring about you, and food is generally good! Always a line of people. However, I do always order the Carribbean salad and the chicken is very bland. No taste. They must keep it in a water based heater like McDonald's. Blah! But the enchilada soup is very good! Hubby likes his orders. And I love any salad with Honey Lime Dressing. But they DO need to fix the bland chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=40,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192

Another one had refilled our drinks before we ordered food.   To me the worst part was never having the manager come over and apologize.   Food was okay.  Came out after each part was cooked so it was separated.

We've also eaten inside twice thinking it was just the to go, it's not. The food and service is the same quality inside as it is in to go.

13,Alyksandr S.,"Houston, TX",58,32,82.0,1.0,2016-05-08,"I should've read the reviews before entering this location.  Before getting our table, we were speaking about how long it had been since the last time we ate at a Chili's. We were complementing the nice decor, food selection, and drink selection. We were so eager to try this restaurant again, but that all changed as we walked in.  As we entered the restaurant, the location was pretty much empty with exception of 3 tables that were fully occupied. First, It took approximately 10 minutes to sit us at a table. As we sat down, the friendly waitress took our drink orders and then brought us our drinks. She then took our food orders and basically disappeared. 45 minutes later she came to ask us if we needed some refills but at this time we were upset because no one had come to explain to us why our orders were taking so long. Before thinking about walking out, the waitress informed us that the manager was helping her serve our food to bring it to us. Finally, after an hour long wait (in an empty restaurant) our food was brought out. To make things worse, one of the orders was wrong and we just returned it.  I do not understand the service in this establishment and apparently we have not been the only ones who experienced this poor service. We were expecting the manager to come and apologize and check on us to see if everything was ok after we had been served, but NOPE. He didn't acknowledge the only table he had on that one section. No apologies for wrong order nor the long 1 hour wait. We will definitely not be returning to this establishment. Such a disappointment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
19,Tom H.,"Richmond, TX",22,72,3.0,1.0,2016-05-30,"Chili's needs to stop. Stop changing your menu every couple of months and stop Hiring people who are either incompetent at best or those who hate their job.  Im not expecting butt kissing or cartwheels but damn you could feel the bad attitude coming off this bartender.  No follow up service, no asking how everything was. No thanks I learned my lesson. Not to mention the wings got there cold",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
23,Jerry R.,"Richmond, TX",0,7,,3.0,2016-08-13,It's been many years since I had been to Chili's so I decided to stop by with my cousin for an appetizer and a drink. The guy who took our order was polite and all and got us our drinks pretty quick. Now the appetizer on the other hand took forever! Went to the men's room and it was filthy. A roll of toilet paper was unrolled on the floor and as I was going back to my seat I was looking about and seen paper napkins on the floor and two waitresses just standing around talking. Never again will I be going back! Update:  Since my visit I was contacted by Chili's and they assured me that they would address my issues regarding my last visit so I reluctantly went back about a month later and yes my experience there was much better. But I will only give them a three star rating even though they corrected the issues and hopefully it will stay that way.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
20,M. L.,"Houston, TX",0,23,26.0,3.0,2016-09-19,Been Chilis customer for a long time; this by far the worst experience. Waitress was nice but service was subpar - no napkins then took forever to get some and I had to the take out area to request them for my table; forgot avocado on nachos and very limited sour cream. Just not good ..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
15,Cody W.,"Rosenberg, TX",71,23,1.0,1.0,2016-12-18,"I feel like you know what you're getting when you go to a Chili's.  Acceptable food and average service for a reasonable price are the drawing feature to this restaurant chain.  This particular location, unfortunately, fails to meet the very attainable standard set by Chili's restaurants. We have come to this location on a few different occasions for a small late night bite to eat and a drink or two.  The service is always questionable and the food and drink is never great, but it serves the purpose for which we are looking.  What I would normally rate as a two or three star establishment dropped to a rare one star rated location yesterday. We walked in to try lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated quickly, but that's where the service stopped. We sat there for almost fifteen minutes and no one even came to acknowledge us. There was no drink order, no waters, or even a hello.  More than three different servers and staff members made eye contact with us as we patiently waited, but nothing.  Finally, in awe, we smiled, laughed it off, and stood up from our booth to walk out. On our way out the woman who had originally shown us to our seat glanced our way as we walked by and then continued to go about her business.  We are never rude, regardless of the situation, and we were not this time either, but we did have to leave and walk to the McAllisters next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

25,Bob O.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,63,,5.0,2017-01-06,Always stellar service! Always good food. Occasionally slow because they're understaffed but that is not the service staffs fault. Tip the service staff but toast the tight wad manager. It 's management fault for not having their resources allocated efficiently.

7,Parveen B.,"Houston, TX",0,4,2.0,1.0,2017-01-07,"Been here couple of times. Both for take out and dine in.  Dine service is spotty. Service can be better. Once waited an hour for food. The manager did come by to let us know there was an issue with our food. Which was odd since there was only two other tables, both (2 tops) came after us and was receiving food before us.  Food was hot and good tho.  Had take out here several time. Always a wait so your food just sit there and gets cold or they forgot an item. But today was the worst!!! I came in said I was there for pick up and then we go through the process of checking the food. I noticed how hard and dark my original chicken crispers were I then told the server that it didn't look right. The server however thought it was a good idea to basically say I am wrong and that's how they always looked and made a point to tell me they had just been cooked. No! They looked like chicken that had been sitting out and they wanted to refry them and pass them off as new ones. Waited another 3 minutes for fresh ones. They looked fine and I paid and went home. Only to find out the breading is undercooked and the other half of my food is overcooked. HORRIBLE!!!  Either they have a cook who doesn't know how to cook or they don't give a crap about customer satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
11,Maddy T.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,44,9.0,1.0,2017-01-28,"Firstly, I understand it's a chilis and not a 5 star restaurant and they have lately tried to lure in customers with a new revised menu and new decor so we came in.  Fairly slow and took about 30 minutes for food.  Ordered the sizzling fajitas with two steak orders for about 15 dollars. (Had to pay an extra 2 dollars for steak for each order) so almost 17 dollars. On top of that you have to pay 1.50 for rice and beans no longer included.  And what we received was not enough steak for one person.  The manager just implied we were wrong and that it has always been this way. Although maybe a year ago or two I know that me and my 2 friends could go and split the fajitas. The funny part was they included 6 tortillas like there was ANY way we could make 6 steak tacos from this.  Ordered the dessert and it's now almost 8 dollars for a cake. It seems like chili's has been raising prices without raising quality of food.  We feel extremely ripped off and for their new prices it seems insane.

14,Faisal I.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,2.0,2017-02-19,"I am a regular here because I love their chocolate cake. I have always ordered to go and tonight was my first time dining here. We were seated right away but when our server came to our table he did not even introduce himself. He was very rude, did not greet or smile and pretty much there the menu on the table and walked away. I ordered a salad and when it finally came I was not given silverware to eat with until asked for. I will probably keep coming here to pick up their cake but not dining here again.

18,F A.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,11,2.0,1.0,2017-04-15,Worst location ever. I would just drive further out and go to the one near Williams trace location. The manager at this location is unqualified to be in the position. All staff here are kids that can careless about customer service. One waiter smelled so bad it was gross to be served food from him. We just walked out and left. The place has barely any customers yet they take over 30min to get the food out.

9,Roman B.,"Rosenberg, TX",93,18,24.0,4.0,2017-06-07,"Chilis, like most other chains, is very hit or miss. I understand it's very much a ""bang for your buck"" type of place and due to lower food prices, you can typically expect a lower quality of service and possibly food. However, today I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of both. After having to seat ourselves at the bar area due to there being no apparent host, my mother and I both ordered the 6 oz sirloin and two house salad options from the 2 for 20 menu. The steaks were cooked to our liking and aside from one of my sides coming out late, everything seemed okay. Our server/bartender was solid, taking into consideration how much ground he had to cover. An excellent option for two people looking to avoid cooking at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosenberg,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

1,Cat W.,"Katy, TX",66,158,178.0,1.0,2017-10-29,"If I could leave zero stars I absolutely would. The worst service I've ever had anywhere, ever.  Sat with empty drinks for 20 mins, watched our beers sit at the bar for 15 mins before I got the hostess to get them for us. Table never cleared, not checked on one single time. Literally. The only time we got anything is when one of us got up to get help.  After waiting 40 mins for our check ( one friend was paying cash) one of our friends asked for the manager and they flat out refused to go get him. What now? Then said the bad service was because our server had another table that was bigger. Ummm negative all this started long before you sat him a huge party.  Hostess brings our check and gets huffy when I tell her we are trying to split it. Then says "" only 2 of you drank 5 beers???"" Well yeah, not hard to do when you are in a Chilis for over TWO HOURS because you can't seem to get out of there. Also none of your business what your guests are drinking or how much, a beer an hour is completely normal.  I have never been so pissed off. Oh and to top it all off when my friend wanted to pay their check in cash NO ONE ever came back. He sees the manager and while having him cash him out he says what our experience was and the manager says "" he has a large table, sorry about that"" ARE YOU SERIOUS?
