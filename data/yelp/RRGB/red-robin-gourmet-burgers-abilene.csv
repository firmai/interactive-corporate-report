Gayle S.,"Abilene, TX",0,2,7,2.0,12/23/2017,"I usually don't have the problem with chain restaurants many reviewers do, but I really think Red Robin is mediocre at best.  The main thing I like about their food are the fries and campfire sauce.  Burgers are okay, but that's it.  Tea is good usually.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene
Ben D.,"Abilene, TX",0,10,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Previous visits it was outstanding and food great but price was high, returned last week wife and grandson. Got order wrong, burgers came out and the they were cold. Waited on correct order for mine and it took forever. Then arrived to have the patty super hot and bun stone cold. Very dissapointed considering the price paid for food. Staff was pleasant and friendly but apparent the kitchen was less than attentive. For the price it should be hot food to the table. Very dissappointed and may consider not returning. Shame since i do love the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene
Anthony M.,"Austin, TX",418,247,333,4.0,6/11/2017,Bottomless fries. Campfire dipping sauce. Freckled Lemonade. Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap. What's not to like about Red Robin? The new store remodel has made this place much nicer than what it used to be a few years back. The service is good and it's fast. Always satisfied when I come.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene
Ashlee V.,"Tucson, AZ",10,131,24,3.0,4/18/2016,"Overall I was unimpressed with this particular RR.  Sometime chain restaurants do something that sets them apart from all the others, therefore leaving a lasting impression. This location fell short.  The service was standard and so was the food. They did not put in a fry refill right away so that my kiddos could munch away while we waited like a lot of the other locations do.... But this may be something that RR as a whole is putting a limit on.  It also took quite a long time to get our food.  The place was very busy, but in that case that is the reason for the fry refill.  I tried their new Top Ramen burger and although it was ok, I regretted getting it and not going with my standard Royal burger.  The families food was fine and they had baseball games on each tv.  Overall an average RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene

We got there we were seated, waitress came to get our drink order, we asked her for some endless fries, she stated, "" if she has time she would bring us out some"". I looked around when she went to go get our drinks. The place was just about dead, there was no reason not to bring us fries. She brings us our drinks with attitude, i ask for sweet n low. She leaves and this guy, busboy brings us sweet n low and slams it on the table, making my tea spill. He stated she told me to bring this here. We would have talked to the manager, but my gf works at walmart, she said he's always rude, so we got up and left. NEVER AGAIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene
Bob H.,"Merkel, TX",13,7,,2.0,6/14/2017,We're still here and it's the worst experience we've ever had at this establishment. First we sat down and waited almost 20 minutes.  A server from another area came to take our order.  We waited another 30 minutes for the meal.  Mine was ok but my wife's shrimp was super salty.  We spoke to the manager about it and while she apologized I'm skeptical that it'll be fixed.

Herbert K.,"Lubbock, TX",10,25,,3.0,8/3/2016,"If you have been to one Red Robin you have been to all....for the most part.  I remember when I used to enjoy coming here, now they are just a rip off and nothing special.

Tom S.,"Clyde, TX",13,12,,1.0,2/11/2017,"Hadn't been here in a couple years. Got the menu and the prices had skyrocketed! Cheaper to get a steak down the street. Figured I would get some sweet tea, big mistake. Would think at $15 for a burger they could use real sugar, but no, chemical sweetener.

carissa t.,"Scott AFB, IL",1,30,,2.0,9/30/2016,"The service was pretty good (especially as we had quite s few kids in our group). The waitress was on the ball with refilling drinks and our food came pretty fast. However, it tasted pretty bad and was way overpriced; I had some TBA croissant thing that turned out to be 2 slices of turkey lunch meat, microwaved bacon and a pile of lettuce on a stale, dry bun. I took 3 bites and dumped the rest, and those 3 bites cost me like 12 bucks. Two of my kids had chicken tenders and they were fine, but my other son had a pizza that smelled like musty towels. I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene
Tris W.,"Wailuku, HI",168,202,2817,5.0,6/30/2015,"I've been to several Red Robins in different locations and they seem pretty consistent. My favorite burgers are their whiskey river bbq and their banzai burger. I always order their banzai burger with extra teriyaki sauce and side of ranch. Over the years they have changed the portion of their fries that initially comes with your food but it is bottomless fries so you can get refills. I love their food. My favorite beverage other than an ice cold beer is their freckled lemonade. That is bottomless as well. Delicious. This location was jam packed when we went on a Saturday afternoon but our service was fantastic. We were seated promptly, our drinks were refilled regularly and our waitress definitely knew what she was doing. We left there feeling fat and happy. My mouth is watering now...lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene
Megan L.,"Abilene, TX",0,3,,1.0,6/9/2016,"If I could give zero stars I would. This place has gone downhill. My waitress had the personality of a brick wall and my food wasn't even appropriate for an animal. I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich. I bit into it and it was like rubber. I couldnt bite through it at all. I send it back, the manager (i think) comes up and says ""oh sorry I guess the chicken was old or something."" WHAT?! Nasty food with even more awful customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene
Danny H.,"Lueders, TX",18,9,15,1.0,5/22/2016,We went to red Robin today asked for a gluten-free menu and she told us we could find it online she was very rude and obnoxious and then tried to put us in a both that was fit for a small child and when we ask for a table it seem to up set her like she had to sit there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene
Garry H.,"Abilene, TX",202,800,1310,3.0,3/27/2014,"4 star food and 1 star prices. I like red robin. Everything I have tried has been delicious, but their prices are crazy.

Amanda R.,"Austin, TX",38,19,2,1.0,1/31/2016,Hadn't been in a while so we decided to go for dinner. Ordered the bacon cheeseburger and a raspberry tea. My tea glass had mold or something on the inside of it and my burger was so dry and you could tell it was a frozen patty. Very tasteless and rubbery. Bacon was limp and it was pretty tough as well. So disappointed. Almost $40 later and I left hungry because I couldn't finish the burger. Asked my husband if it was just me and he said his wasn't very good either (and he usually loves any kind of burger). We won't be back. Save your money and go to one of the other burger places in town. Cheaper and fresh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene

Allen U.,"Odessa, TX",10,175,580,4.0,3/15/2015,"Great exotic burgers and endless fries is all Red Robin has going for them and let's not forget their flavored lemonades and mixed drinks. Towering onion rings to start, great app, then off to my smoke-pepper bacon cheeseburger, was well cooked on the grill and keep the steak fries coming. Overall great food...our server tended to avoid us as we reached the bottom of our beverages before he ever arrive and for that deserves a 4-star.

At one point the shift manager was waiting on us.  Even though we yes ma'amed her, she repeatedly called us ""guys"" and ""hon"", that's just disrespectful.  I am only one persons ""hon"" and she's not it! The food was good but the kitchen was super slow as always.  They changed their bottomless fries to only after you receive your meal, if you get fries before your meal you have to pay extra, sorry but that's not bottomless.  Not to mention fries before keep little ones at bay while waiting 40 minutes on the super slow kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene?start=20

When I checked in, I specifically asked to not be seated in a small booth. When a hostess walked us to our seat, it was a 2 person booth. When I commented that I had asked to not be seated in this type booth, she was very indifferent.

Sarah M.,"Fort Meade, MD",64,102,14,5.0,1/8/2012,"Stopped by today after we came into town for a little shopping and we were very impressed! Our server (Amanda I think) was very attentive and efficient, she was friendly and clearly has a ton of knowledge about her company! We noticed that as she walked by the tables she looked at our glasses first and also checked on us, then she'd come back down the aisle with tea and water, or would bring a new drink for my husband. We were very pleased to have had her as our sever!!  The timing was amazing, I couldn't believe how quickly they ha our dinner out. Also since my hubby and I were splitting a wrap and a salad, she had then put everything onto two plates for us! Great!! The food at RR is so consistent, no matter where we have eaten it.

Heather D.,"Roanoke, VA",81,77,9,3.0,8/22/2012,"Red Robin has now reopened, after being closed down for a bit because of nonpayment. I had heard rumors that they had to hire a lot of new staff and some that had tried it immediately after the reopen weren't impressed.  We were promptly greeted, seated and had our drink orders taken. Both my friend and I got draft Fat Tires, but were given no coasters. The waitress had them in her back pocket, so I'm glad we *didn't* get them (mmmm, butt sweat).  I don't eat meat, so I ordered the BLTA croissant without the back and turkey. For once, the order taker didn't freak out because of my order AND it was correctly made! Our food arrived quickly and was good, but I was sad to see that they no longer serve cantaloupe slices along with the fries and sandwich.  I would love to give four stars, but after we got our food, we were never checked in on, besides the one time the gal behind the bar hollered at us to see if we needed anything else (at this point, we had been done for awhile). This normally would have been fine with me, but we saw a group of servers sitting/standing around chatting. They could take a hint from one of the busboys who politely asked if he could take away our empty dishes (and every time I saw him he was doing the same to other tables).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene?start=20
