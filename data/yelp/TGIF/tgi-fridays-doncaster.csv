Megan B.,"Hillcrest, Australia",178,207,131,5.0,8/10/2015,We were given a large booth on a busy night and got to watch the restaurant run like a well oiled machine Our waiter was at the table within five minutes to take drink orders. I took a recommendation from our waitress and ordered a mango peach lemonade.  Drinks arrived promptly and were delicious. We got a plate of twisters to share. That's the secret here don't fill up on the delicious starters because it is tempting but the mains are so big and so delicious that you may explode I got the steak ribs and shrimp player which was delicious and bigger than my torso steak was cooked perfectly ribs fell off the bone and the shrimp was moist and tender there were sides but I wanted to save room for desert because the brownies are Devine,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-doncaster
Amanda H.,"Reservoir, Australia",1,2,,1.0,11/11/2015,"If I could give no stars, I would. This is the worst restaurant I've been to in the 20 years of my life. The staff were impatient, extremely rude, and lacked any bit of customer service. The food took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table after we ordered, and a few on our table had to wait up to an hour! When we complained about this, the waiter started calling certain members of our table crude names. When we complained to the manager, he shrugged it off and said there was nothing he could do about it.  Onto the food, it was disgusting. Barely edible. I don't believe anyone had finished their dish on our table. The burger I had was drenched in oil, the patty was overcooked and had horrible flavor. Maybe it's a personal taste thing, but you'd think a burger that cost $20-30 would be somewhat decent.  Would never enter a TIGF Friday's again and will continue to share my story to anyone who even considers this ""restaurant"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-doncaster
Chris R.,"Doncaster East, Australia",2,11,1,5.0,4/5/2015,"Awesome venue this one. Having been three times over about 2 months, the manager seems to have made it his business to learn all repeat customers faces and greets them like family.  Food is simply awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-doncaster
