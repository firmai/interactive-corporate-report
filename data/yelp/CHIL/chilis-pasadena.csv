Tina S.,"La Porte, TX",247,20,16,5.0,12/20/2014,Vey fast service and friendly wait staff! Food very tasty! Atmosphere vibrant and fun! Definitely a family place and kids welcome! They have convenient check out service at your table and I would recommend this place to all!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Zuri A.,"Houston, TX",0,7,,1.0,6/24/2016,Horrible service! 6 friends and I went out for lunch and when we asked for the bill the waitress gave us all the wrong bills and then told us to handle it . Not to mention that she was rude when she took our drink refills and gave us the bill before we had even finished eating making us feel rushed . Didn't even give us to go boxes,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Wanda G.,"Pasadena, TX",36,164,65,4.0,7/22/2014,"We began coming here when I had a problem with service att he obne on Spencer. The service here is always excellent! Food is always great! We get the 2 for 20, mainly because they get the steak done properly. We tried their new Cinnamon Molten Cake.. THIS IS TO DIE FOR!! Great cinnamon taste, the right amount of texture without being too gooey. Will definately order this again. we did split it three way. It is big, but really for two to share.  I will continue to come here whenwe are in the mood for Chili's. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Misty K.,"Pasadena, TX",70,57,55,3.0,8/6/2015,"Food was okay.  Burger had mustard and I'm not really a fan of mustard in my burgers.   Triple play with egg rolls, chk crispers and big mouth bites were good.  It's happy hour until 7:00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
German A.,"Houston, TX",99,48,5,1.0,2/22/2015,"We got there Friday at 7pm, party of 7. We're told we'd have to wait 15 to 20 minutes for a table. There was a rockets game barely starting on the tv. After waiting for 45 minutes, we check with hostess what's taking so long. She skipped us and we were not on the list she was looking at. Awesome.  We finally got sat and waitress took our drinks. Ordered some appetizers since we were hungry.  20 minutes and we get our drinks. We order appetizers and food. Appetizers take another 30 minutes. Waitress dissapears. No refills, no food. We've been here more than 2  hours. The rockets game is now OVER. Done. We won. Yey. Good job rockets. Still no food. The chips for the appetizer were soo salty. Like, i thought Ashton kutcher was going to come out and tell us we got punkd. Ashton never showed. The salt showed up. Salt with chips dusted on is a more accurate assessment of the situation. We start a conversation about possibly going to get food at jack in the box, because were so hungry. We made a pie chart of the pros and cons. We discuss it as a committee. Majority rules apply, and 2 people said wait 15 more minutes. So we wait. No food. We reopen the case to go somewhere else. This time, we present a persuasive speech to the jury. We decide to go. We look for our waitress to get the bill. She's still missing. Someone should have called an amber alert for that waitress. That's how missing she was. We walk to the front, tell the hostess to get the manager. Takes 5 minutes for the manager to walk out. Waitress still no where. Bus boys come to the table we were at and cleaned it. Still nobody. No food visible. It was about to be 3 hours later, and we tell the manager were leaving, out of courtesy. No dine and dash, we ask for a receipt. He says ""are y'all just gonna leave?"" ""Yes. There's no food. We're hungry."" ""...okay"" and just stares at us. We turn and leave. Hostess is all like ""have a good night!"" I laughed out loud ""she said have a good night""  I will never go to Pasadena ever again. Not chilis, the entire city. It was just a Friday. We got quicker service valentines day at Olive Garden with a 2 hour wait time to be seated.  Horrible service. Wish I could tell you about the food, but we never got any. The tv that shows the basketball games works. You can watch an entire game on it. I can vouche for that. The soda was delicious. It was a coca cola.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Nichole C.,"Pasadena, TX",2,8,1,1.0,7/17/2015,May 23rd came in to celebrate a fam members bday; got a hair in my tacos as a thank you from chili's. Server said the manager would come speak to me but he/she never materialized. Won't be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Q R.,"Houston, TX",288,7,2,1.0,3/12/2015,Not enough servers during lunch. One server changed his lip piercing out in the open and then brought someone's food to the table without washing his hands. I can only imagine what happens in the back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Rich L.,"Pasadena, TX",276,56,13,5.0,10/11/2014,Cool place to eat  yummy in my little tummy but anyways this place has tablets to order food and pay check it out,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Laura A.,"Pasadena, TX",255,540,14,3.0,1/4/2014,"This is not my favorite restaurant, but a friend wanted to go here.  I will say the margaritas we got were pretty potent (I forgot what they were called, sorry.  they came in a shaker cup and with a martini glass).  I got one of the flatbread pizzas and it was surprisingly good.  I didn't care for the side salad, was a little meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Itian A.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2015,"Arrived and waited 10 minutes for a server to greet and seat us, but nobody even made eye contact with us. Although three of the waitresses saw us waiting, they avoided us. In fact, one of those waitresses came storming out with food in her mouth to take a parties' order. This is not the first time I have a bad experience with this specific Chilis which is why I'm taking the time to rate them so low and keep you from disappointment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Tannia L.,"Pearland, TX",199,60,80,5.0,5/30/2014,"Great food, always love them. Everywhere I go. Great hangout spot for a drink or two or a lunch/dinner spot with friends and family.  Only thing that sucks is their tortillas!! Barf... Very store bought!!! I still give them 5 stars :) I should know better than to order fajitas with tortillas at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Chele R.,"Houston, TX",1,21,5,1.0,12/28/2014,"Ordered lunch last week. Went pick up. My flatbread pizza was Horrible. Soggy, dry, missing ingredients. Won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Allie H.,"Pasadena, TX",0,5,,2.0,8/8/2014,"Don't even know why I'm giving them 2 stars. We have been a couple of times. Before the remodel, service was awful. Did not get drinks for at least 10 minutes, food took way too long and came out cold. After remodel, we thought we'd give them another shot. It was worse. Took over 25 minutes (no, I'm not exaggerating) for the waiter to greet us AFTER we were sat. Food came out wrong. And they tried to charge us for playing games on the tablet at the table while we waited so long for a waiter! Talked to the manager and he was very disconcerned and made it seem like we were bothering him. Shame because I've always loved chili's. Won't be going to this one again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Krystal D.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/2/2015,"The service at the Pasadena, TX location seems to be consistently horrible. My husband and I tried going back for lunch this afternoon after having two previous encounters. Service was horrible, took about 5 minutes to be greeted. Our appetizer took a while to come out then my food was cold to the touch, literally. I sent it back then when it came back it still tasted horrible. The shrimp I ordered looked and tasted like something you'd get from Walmart. Not the quality you think you'd receive for what Chili's charges. Completely unsatisfied. I will never go back again nor will I recommend to anyone else. I'm not one to write reviews but I felt so strongly about this I just had to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Scott B.,"Pasadena, TX",18,19,14,5.0,3/21/2010,"Primary purpose of our visit was to eat lunch. 12noon-1pm on Sunday. Seated promptly upon arrival and greeted by our Brandon immediately. Brandon took our drink order. Restaurant was clean and lighting was appropriate. Server was very attentive.  Server did not offer appetizers or desserts. I was able to place my order quickly and it arrived within a reasonable amount of time. Food tasted great.  Food tasted fresh. Food was NOT prepared as ordered; however, server quickly replaced dish to order in less than five minutes. Portion size was perfect. Food temperature was perfect. Manager did not visit table or ask for feedback during the visit. Overall experience was excellent. Likely to recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Dylan H.,"Dickinson, TX",53,234,23,2.0,9/10/2013,"Upon entering I was assaulted by the scent of mold, but the smell diminished as I was let to a booth.   The chicken was good, but room temperature, and the southwestern egg rolls tasted...odd.  I wish I had a better term.  Slimy, maybe?  Definitely not what you'd expect of a classic Chili's appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Bobby Z.,"La Porte, TX",26,19,1,5.0,9/30/2012,This location rocks!  I was always Fridays person but the last 4 yrs I've become a Chili's fan!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Elizabeth T.,"Houston, TX",3,55,21,2.0,5/27/2011,This was the first time I've ever felt rushed to eat my food. The waiter brought out the food and the bill at the same time! Then I got a guiltless chicken sandwich and OMG the broccoli was so dang salty! Tastes like it had been dipped in a salt shaker. My son who loves broccoli took a bite and spit it out and started crying. Make sure you ask for no seasoning if your trying to watch your sodium intake. Other than that the food was OKAY I've had better and better service at other chilies where I didn't feel rushed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Cookie D.,"Pasadena, TX",0,6,,2.0,5/9/2013,Wait staff good burgers not so much got a cheese burger for my daughter it was so over cooked and black around the edges that when it came and I saw how burnt it was I instantly asked her if she wanted catsup on it but she still ended up just eating the bread and the middle of the patty. After the first bite she asked her brother to trade half of his chicken sandwich that was cooked ok for half of her burger he did but he didn't eat the burger except for a couple of bites. I got the new guacamole burger also black around the edges and dry with burnt almost unrecognizable onions solid black I got a cup of enchilada soup it was good. Kids also thought the broccoli and corn was good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Rebecca T.,"Pasadena, TX",137,14,,5.0,3/8/2010,They have the nicest wait staff there.  They actually like waiting on their customers and appreciate us coming there.  The buffalo chicken salad with no chicken (vegetarian style) is DA BOMB!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20
Tangie S.,"Pasadena, TX",70,157,339,3.0,9/26/2017,"I like Chili's but it's not my favorite restaurant or anything. I usually order the Triple Dipper. The last time I ordered it, I got the following 3 appetizers: Sliders, Southwest Egg Rolls and Original Chicken Crispers. It was great! I forgot how delicious those Chicken Crispers are! They are so fluffy and crispy. Yum! My boyfriend ordered the Sirloin Steak and broccoli. He was going on and on about how good the steamed broccoli was. I'm not a broccoli fan so I don't get it. The steak he said was just OK. His daughter ordered some kind of Cajun Pasta. It looked delicious but rich. Their drinks are good too. We like the Patron margaritas. I wanted to try the Caramel Molten Cake but we were all too full. Bummer! Our server was nice and efficient. But overall this wasn't anything memorable. Chili's is one of those restaurants we hardly ever go to. It's not bad but it's nothing special. I'm sure we will be back again though probably in several months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Emily L.,"Pasadena, TX",42,42,91,4.0,7/29/2017,"I go to Chili's when I can't decide what I want to eat because they have a large variety at a decent price. My husband and I came by for a quick lunch date. He had a burger from the lunch menu which came with fries and your choice of soup or salad. I got the cheese enchiladas.  The hubby LOVES burgers!! He says the burgers at Chili's are good, but he wouldn't rank them in him top burgers. They're just regular burgers. My cheese enchiladas were good. They were very cheesy and they had an ancho sauce, with cilantro rice and black beans. They were very filling, and I would get them again. Our food was served piping hot and in a timely manner. I gave four stars because the food is pretty good, and I've never had a problem with it, but there's nothing about it that's super special. I also like that I can pay at my table and not have to worry about my card be taken away by a stranger. On the other hand, there have been several times when I've had poor service. All in all, I will of course be back. Hopefully with better service, but at least I know that my food will good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Cypher G.,"La Porte, TX",0,2,,4.0,1/9/2018,Tried the chicken and waffles but after you eat if you're probably going to have to be on a diet for about a year LOL my server was Jessica and she was really nice and didn't mess up a thing on my order she should get promoted,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Martie E.,"Pike Road, AL",1,38,3,3.0,12/31/2017,"Not off to a good start when we arrived! Seated promptly, but given no menu or anything. Server comes by & asks for drink order & still no menu! Asked for one, then she brings drinks, & forgot menu & straws! By now I am thinking that perhaps we should leave! Finally get menu and order terlingua chili. It was good, but don't think it made up for total lack of service. BTW, it was not busy and there were a lot of servers. Won't be back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Christine C.,"Houston, TX",142,188,497,2.0,5/10/2017,I've been to this location a few times and I'm not impressed. Both times I've had to wait for the host because they were off chatting it up with a server. The tables and chairs have not been cleaned properly and the space just feels dirty. The wait staff I've had have always been pleasant and the food good but I'm not a fan.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena

Trenda W.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,5.0,10/8/2017,"Ordered the skillet queso, old timer with cheese, and the salted caramel molten cake. Awesome as usual. Everything was perfectly cooked. This was my first time to use the online curbside pickup. Outstanding service. I pressed the ""I'm here"" button on the app and within seconds the Togo server was walking my order to the car. I highly recommend using this option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Carolina G.,"Monterrey, Mexico",32,1,,1.0,10/10/2017,"Worst service ever.  I would put 0 stars but I have to put even one in this review. We arrived and anyone give us a table so we chose one by ourselves, by that time the waiter received around 3 more groups, he saw us sitting in there waiting for someone to take our order and did nothing. We stood and asked to another guy for service and he told us that the place where we were sitting was out of service.  We moved and get service around 20 mins after we arrived.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Christy H.,"Pasadena, TX",165,16,73,3.0,7/31/2017,"Ok it's Chilis, not fine dining. Chili's is relaxed,  comfortable and serves fairly decent food. It's consistent,  it's not the best but it's by far not the worst. They have a lot of interesting cocktails, the bar staff is friendly, the wait staff is good. To us the best part about Chili's is playing trivia at the table. That sounds funny but we really enjoy it. If you want a decent meal, relaxed atmosphere and would enjoy some tabletop trivia, then Chilis is the place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Grim T.,"Houston, TX",0,11,6,3.0,3/21/2017,"Had to give this Chili's 3-stars because of repeated horrible experiences on the restraunt side but consistent 4-star experiences on the bar side. With 4.5 star rating for the long-time, highly skilled, chaos-managing bearded bartender. Definitely grab a stool or a booth on the bar side where you are likely to catch both good service & an entertaining sporting event on one of the many TVs. Foods always good. We are fans of the 2 for $22 option. We'd embrace the 2 for $35 which includes two alcoholic beverages, if there were any options other than margaritas. Blech! Warning to the tech-laden, there's no wifi & like one electrical outlet. Welcome to the 90's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Dale J.,"Texas City, TX",84,119,173,4.0,12/26/2015,Good food for dinner on Christmas eve at 8pm. We were on duty and being busy we tied to each a decent meal that's not fast food for our Christmas eve meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Efren A.,"Webster, TX",3,14,8,1.0,5/29/2016,The best thing of my meal was the Dr Pepper! Ordered the 6 ounce sirloin and shrimp and got a tasteless overcooked piece of something. The shrimp looked like it was out of a can and and the place was FILTHY! FILTHY! Chillis has allways been a safe place for a decent meal. Not anymore McDonald's would have been better,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
John G.,"Houston, TX",226,49,45,1.0,9/8/2016,They don't know how to answer the phones when placing to go orders. Person was rude and lacked customer service. It was Very unwelcoming.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Angie A.,"Pasadena, TX",328,48,88,3.0,6/7/2015,"I wanted to post an updated review after my experience today. I ended up at chills for dinner and the dining experience was better than the to-go for sure.  The floor was dirty, the menu was sticky but the food was good and the server was great.  I've always loved chilis and this location just keeps falling flat. I was fine with dinner tonight but I think I will go back to driving to the one on Spencer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Liz A.,"Laredo, TX",131,2,,3.0,9/28/2016,We were a party of 6.. there were plenty of tables and yet we had been waiting for about 15 mins. Until I asked the hostess how much longer for our table to which she replied that we were going to have to wait for one of the tables to leave. (They were barely ordering) I pointed out the plenty empty tables in the back and she says that there were no servers back there. Ridiculous. I told her that I knew one of the servers could simply take care of us. She just said she would ask . We were seated 2 mins later. Our server was great and so was the food. But stand your ground with the hostesses.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Randee R.,"Houston, TX",0,15,,1.0,6/24/2017,"I think it is totally unacceptable to have a waiter with a very long beard serving food. It's a bit disgusting  seeing the tray being carried out with not much distance between the food and the bottom of the beard. And the icing on the cake while waiting in the waiting area to be seated, we see a bug crawling up the wall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Marina C.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,19,4,3.0,2/17/2017,"I just want to say I love chilis but don't like the blueberry pineapple margarita, too sweet and bitter after taste; doesn't taste like blueberry or pineapple. Chilis  please make a little effort to put a bit of real blueberry-pineapple juice to your recipe. I always go for the presidente margarita my favorite, but I thought I give It a try to a new flavor.

Martin Z.,"Pasadena, TX",0,3,1,2.0,8/16/2016,"Let me start with the Ziosk tablet on the table and how FILTHY the thing was, it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months! My nephew and I had to go wash our hands after touching it and never touched it again even though he really wanted to play the trivia games. Our drinks were empty halfway through our food and we never got refills nor did the waitress ever come back to our table to ask until she brought the check which was quite a disappointment being that my nephew was anxious for desert. The food however was great but extremely disappointed on how dirty the place was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena
Adrianne A.,"Houston, TX",11,52,69,2.0,7/7/2015,"Crappy food. Dirty and smells like an old bar. The service is good. That's about the only decent remark I can make.  We're waiting for our house to be built and staying in a nearby hotel, otherwise, we'd never would've  eaten here. Eating out sucks and this place is making that even worse to swallow.

Ronnie M.,"Pasadena, TX",39,80,4,2.0,11/21/2014,"Remodel is great looking, as is the concept behind the revamped menu. The execution is just blah.
