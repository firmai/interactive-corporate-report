19,Julie C.,"Bloomsdale, MO",12,32,14.0,4.0,2012-01-13,"I know, I know - why bother reviewing a chain restaurant.  But bare with me.  I'm reviewing for those of us that don't always have a Benjamin and a half lying around to head to finer fare!  For those of us only holding Mr. Jackson, we head to Chili's (or after a shopping spree where I have buyers remorse and feel as if I'm 'saving' money by eating thrifty :) Chili's in Arnold has yet to disappoint us - why do I approach in the pessimistic fashion?  Because I have a specific, tweak this and that order - and each time, it magically comes out correct!  Chili's is one of the only chains that has decent healthy fare (well, lets forget about sodium content for a minute).  They have a nutritional menu readily available (yes I've looked at it more than once prior to ordering in the restaurant).  Our 'usual' lunch/dinner consists of a basket of chips/salsa (with a bag to go and salsa to boot!) then we split a black bean burger on a wheat bun with low fat honey mustard (aka tweak tweak and tweak) with broccoli (please no butter - tweak #4).  Interesting thing is you have to order a 'normal' burger and then ask for the b.bean pattie as a substitute.  But hey, not a big deal if it means getting something 1/2 way healthy to put down your pie hole.  Bottom line: we consistently leave here bellies satisfied with a pocket of jingle from our Jackson, and not needing to go buy bigger pants.  Hooray!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
18,Jeremy P.,"Sammamish, WA",24,38,1.0,3.0,2012-05-10,"Took my customers to lunch here at their request. The atmosphere was your regular Chili's but I was a bit disappointed in the food. While my customers got exactly what they ordered, the service was more than acceptable and drinks were refilled quickly, my ribeye steak didn't include the sauteed mushrooms or grilled shrimp I ordered *and* it was a bit too salty in my opinion. I would eat there again just to play with the Ziosk machines though! Those things are awesome and in all my travels I had never seen them before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
13,Gregory P.,"Chesterfield, MO",41,166,52.0,4.0,2012-11-25,"My fiance had the shrimp tacos. These were the same tacos that I raved about in a previous review of a Chili's store, but no raving this time. They were bland and devoid of flavor compared my previous experience.  The southwestern eggrolls are still the main reason that we go to Chili's and they didn't not disappoint.  The margaritas are great and the Presidente is better than the standard. I had the honey chipotle chicken. Excellent high marks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
9,Lorraine N.,"Minneapolis, MN",398,1570,1066.0,4.0,2013-01-04,"So ended up at Chili's --for Friday eve happy hour prior to hitting the sofa at home---just to chat with the husband and enjoy a snack---We sat at the bar--our bartender was fun, friendly, and just a nice guy....My lil' Ginger drink was prepared with care and also my vodka crans were served with a lime without me even asking---I love that....My husband was very pleased with his house rita also.... Appetizers were 5.00 so we decided on southwest egg rolls and nachos with chicken.  The Nachos come out similar to a tostada or open faced quesadilla---every chip has cheese chicken and been and is slightly toasted/broiled so they are good and gooey...We were happy.. Pretty decent atmosphere, people, food, drinks, and price....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
16,Joe W.,"Arnold, MO",5,64,5.0,1.0,2013-04-06,"I am giving them one star for the following reasons: 1) The menu's are filthy and it's obvious they aren't cleaned, 2) I used a straw and was able to pull out nasty crust from the grout lines in the tables. They aren't cleaned often either, 3) The food was sub-par at best. It was cold and I ordered fries as a side and got all of about 10, 4) the waitress really meant it when she said ""Grab me if you need anything"" because she only returned to the table (on her own) to take the order and deliver the food. We had to wave her down for drink refills and to complete the missing order parts. I really think this place has low expectations of it's employees because the manager came to our table, asked how our food was but walked away quickly. She was not interested in the slightest. There are tons of better places in the area to go to and I recommend skipping this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
20,Jerry W.,"Poplar Bluff, MO",15,197,70.0,4.0,2013-11-12,We were in a hurry and told the waitress.  Our food was served very quickly.  It was delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold?start=20,,,,,
11,Maddie S.,"O'Fallon, MO",0,14,2.0,1.0,2014-03-18,"My mother and I tried this location a few days ago and we'll never go again. The restaurant was dirty with a lot of dirt on the floor but I could live with that. Once my mother and I got our glasses, though, they were clearly dirty and a lipstick stain was still on my mother's glass! She had to return it and thankfully when she got it back, it was clean. Our utensils were uncleaned also and we returned those as well.  Our food wasn't much better. It had no flavor and wasn't too warm, so we were both disappointed. Our waitress was nice but overall, the experience was awful. I would not recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
17,Jerry H.,"Kansas City, MO",5,1,,1.0,2014-06-25,"Lunch time and not many patrons. No wonder because the young man serving us is awful. Service slow and food just so so. Last visit here.  If you must eat here, sit at the bar. The hostess was curt and dim. My my how far they sunk at Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
14,Ben R.,"Imperial, MO",84,97,26.0,4.0,2015-03-11,"Stopped by one a beautiful evening in Arnold MO with my even more beautiful wife. We were immediately greeted by a nice hostess who unfortunately had RBF. But she was nice enough and sat us promptly. We were sat no longer than 1 minutes before being greeted by our server, a very chipper and laid back gentlemen. We ordered waters (even though they have the Coke Freestyle with a billion flavors) and some chips and salsa. Both came out fairly quick and we were ready to order. My wife got a trio of southwestern meals and I got a smokehouse burger. Both entrees were excellent and our server and a manager checked on us multiple times. Our server gave us some chips and salsa to go, we paid in the table computer, and we left with a great experience! My only complaint would  be that the tables have these grouts in them and if you use any utensil to scrape at them, a bunch of dirty gunk comes up. That's nasty but I understand how hard it is to keep those clean. But it needs to be done! Other than that, it was a great date!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
10,Dave B.,"Arnold, MO",0,12,,1.0,2015-10-18,"I just have to say. I'm VERY disappointed. The last now, 3 times I've been here in 4 months has been poor service. This time I tried carry out. When I arrived home, they had a whole 7 french fries in my hamburger order. It seems nowadays that places don't mind charging you a higher price, whatsoever but when it comes to the quality of the product, it falls WAY short. Needless to say I made a complaint with the manager, and had to drive back up to get another sandwich. Was compensated w $15 in cards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
12,Lily R.,"Arnold, MO",0,1,,5.0,2015-11-11,My server tonight was a very sweet guy named Evan. He was amazing. He helped me get a seat for my daughter and was very helpful. He also walked me though all the different meal choices and made my birthday awesome. He gave me a free desert for my birthday and made me feel so welcome. The place in general was very welcoming and pleasant. Everyone was very friendly and actually really wanted to make sure you had a great experience. I will definitely come back. I hope Evan is my server again. He was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
8,Kenny C.,"Ballwin, MO",38,12,16.0,3.0,2015-12-02,Just got a to-go order. The Manager promptly brought me our food. We got home and our appetizer (fried pickles $6.49) was 8ish small pickles. Super weird....maybe Chili's wasn't such a good idea. Food was eh'. Tipped 7.50 on 25,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
21,Leslie F.,"Moscow Mills, MO",1,78,3.0,1.0,2015-12-20,"I love Chili's! You get what you order and it's always very standard across the board with the food and even the staff. Today we visited this one and it was terrible. I asked for the dressing on the side and when it was brought out it didn't have any dressing at all.. Ok no big deal, I stopped the waiter and asked for dressing. My husband received his burger with less than a half an order of fries, he was told by the runner that dropped it off ""obviously this is less than an order of fries, when more are done we'll bring them out."" He never got those fries.. Back to my salad, it was missing pineapple all together and the chicken was cold and rubbery. I again flagged down our server and told him ""there's no pineapple and the chicken is rubbery. Can I get some pineapple and a fresh chicken breast?"" He came back a few minutes later asking me if I wanted a new salad. At this point my husband was almost done with his burger and 1/2 order of fries. I asked if he could just bring me the chicken and pineapple. The manager came over after I was done and asked how it was. I told him it was weird, the chicken was off.. He said oh sorry and took my plate. They took 50% off my salad. We will not go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold?start=20,,,,,
6,Faith R.,"Imperial, MO",69,82,77.0,5.0,2016-04-02,Stopped in after a band concert for my daughter. We sat on the bar side and the bartender waited on us. He was fabulous. One of the best waiter we have had. Service was fast and accurate. The food was great. My husband had the prime rib burrito which is new and he said it was amazing. I always get the honey crispers. They are so good!! We were full and happy when we left. We will come back for sure. The Arnold Chili's is one of the best in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
7,Harry T.,"De Soto, MO",4,49,,4.0,2016-05-27,Pretty good. My fries were nice and crispy and a juicy burger. The bathroom was out of paper towels or else they'd get 5 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
3,Tanya M.,"Cahokia, IL",210,448,66.0,3.0,2016-08-02,"I recently had surgery.  I am just know able to eat regular food.  This is one of my favorite locations.  I stopped in for lunch.  I ordered a soup and half sandwich lunch special.  I felt so bad that all I could eat was half of the soup and had to take the rest to go.  I really like the southwest chicken soup. They no longer serve a cup of soup. They only serve bowls of soup.  The chicken sandwich was very good, even though I ate it the next day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
4,Paul E.,"Imperial, MO",6,5,,5.0,2016-10-18,Service is always good.  The kids love it here and we always leave pleased.  Yelp thinks that's to short so I'll drill on a bit more.  My daughter loves the margarita grilled chicken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
5,Kaitlin S.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,4,,5.0,2017-03-06,amazing food! Everything I ordered was delicious. Our server was very nice and offered dessert and appetizers and made sure we had drinks the whole time I've never had a bad experience at this location. Keep it up Chilis!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
1,Rex H.,"Hillsboro, MO",27,139,48.0,5.0,2017-05-07,"Love the food and the easy ordering on line for to go orders.  There is really nothing here that is not really good, but my favorite is the bowls. Wife loves the chickens ranch quesadillas. Good job Chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
2,Amanda R.,"Fenton, MO",2,1,,1.0,2017-06-04,My husband and I went in for lunch today and sat at the bar for 10 minutes while the bartender walked passed us about 10 times without any service. Finally came over and got my husband a beer and I asked for a water... I waited another 5 minutes for him to get that. Needless to say we just left. Won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
0,Angela G.,"Arnold, MO",13,19,9.0,4.0,2017-07-14,I would of gave you a 5 star rating but you guys took away my spicy mac and cheese. Waitresses are all pretty good. Food is usually always great!! BRING BACK THE SPICY MAC AND CHEESE!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arnold,,,,,
