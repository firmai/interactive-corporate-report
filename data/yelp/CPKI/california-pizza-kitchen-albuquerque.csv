Andrea R.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,3,1,5.0,7/6/2017,"This was my first time coming to this restaurant. They asked when we arrived if we had been there before and I told them no. A little in to being there the general manager brings over a complimentary dish to welcome us.  He asked if he could bring my six year old some pizza dough to play with! What kid wouldn't love that! Food was great, service was great! Definitely made an impression and will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Janeth N.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,14,,5.0,3/3/2017,"The food and service here is excellent and it is a very family-friendly place. I came here with my infant daughter and the staff was very attentive and accommodating, helping us to get seated and even taking the time to help me with her complicated stroller! The server Michelle and manager Devon really went out of their way to make it a positive dining experience. The veggie pizza was delicious! I would definitely come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Julian G.,"Albuquerque, NM",18,161,106,3.0,5/12/2015,"Ever leave a place walking a bit funny because the bill was a bit steep and you didn't really feel like it was worth it? Well that's how I felt here.  You would think that at 11am (when they open) you would receive fast service. Well that is not the case. It took over an hour for our food to come and quite honestly it wasn't that great. The bill for 2 adults and a baby... 40 bones. Yikes...  If you have a lot of time and money to blow go here but if you're like me and look for places that deliver service and food that is worth every dime of your hard earned moolah, there are better places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Holly S.,"Albuquerque, NM",31,56,26,4.0,3/13/2016,"Ironically, we came here for salads. And yes, it was very hard... And took a lot of will power to watch all those pizzas go by as you order your ""quinoa arugula"" salad.  However, we come here for salads because they are delicious and big! You have a great selection of your 1,500 calorie ranch, bacon bit loaded salad, but also have a great selection of genuinely nutritious salads that will definitley fill you up. I got the quinoa arugula salad in the half size, and as noted it was more than enough. Get a full size if you want to make two meals out of your visit.  Delicious and nutritious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Alton B.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,27,3,4.0,5/22/2017,"If you are not a huge Pizza fan not to worry this incredible place will offer you something that you do like. They have a Pizza centric menu but also seafood, subs and Desserts that will make your mouth water.   They offer outside seating and the inside is spacious and modern. My Pizza was perfect and my wife's shrimp scampi passed her critical tastebuds.  Attentive service even from the manager. They do lose a point due to the difficulty of finding a parking space. All in All.  Great food. Great Service. Great Time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Richard S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,131,12,3.0,4/5/2017,"Maybe my tastes are more sophisticated than they used to be. Idk. For $19.99, I expect the salmon to be stellar. It wasn't. It was mediocre.

Bruce H.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,28,,3.0,4/22/2017,"Not as good as last time. The waitress was pleasant but it seemed to take forever to get our orders. I had the tortilla soup with half chicken sandwich lunch combo.  The soup was OK, but the sandwich was very skimpy on chicken. (I actually had to open the sandwich to verify there was any chicken there at all!) More coleslaw than meat. Also, the bread they put it on was tasty but, perhaps because of the preponderance of coleslaw, it was starting to dissolve halfway through eating it and the whole thing became very messy. It wasn't horrible, just not great and I wouldn't order this again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Alyssa H.,"New Richmond, OH",211,333,225,4.0,2/17/2016,"California dreamin', after being here! I was so impressed by this pizza kitchen, considering I'm not a huge pizza person. The employees were super accommodating for my vegan needs and my friend's gluten-free needs. My big group of 14 people all seemed to really enjoy what they ordered. The food was really tastey. We did have to wait a little while for it, but it wasn't too long a wait.  They have wonderful salads, and the pizza crust IS vegan! They even offered up a free dessert for our friend's birthday. Good for group outings, dates, or simply lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Alicia F.,"Albuquerque, NM",40,144,198,2.0,6/25/2016,"Pros: Amazingly delicious pizza and salad! Cons: The service was horrible tonight. Last time it was mediocre at best. Also the prices are too high for what you get.  I have dined here on two occasions. Once for lunch and tonight for dinner. I typically like to wait before I review a restaurant, so I did. On my first visit, I had a lunch special with the salad and pizza, and my mother ordered a sandwich and salad. Both items were superb! I had the BBQ chicken pizza and a spinach and quinoa salad, and wow super yummy! I also had the mango iced tea which was great! My mom had the turkey and Brie, and she loved it (plus the salad but I can't remember which one).  Honestly, the food was so great we wanted to return! The prices were steep (like $15 per person), but we were satisfied. The service wasn't the best, but it had slightly improved near the end so we looked past it. We figured at least the girl was kind and was able to get us what we needed.  However, in search of somewhere to eat tonight I remembered that we had a special coupon for this place, and pizza sounded good and I was in the mood for a salad.  So since my dad had missed the last trip here, we decided to bring him there! We were greeted and seated right away, and our drink orders were taken quickly. Everything seemed to be going swell, but then I had requested a water for my mom... We waited and waited, but nothing. I decided since I had ordered a drink and a water I would just give her mine and wait for the new one. Finally about 12 minutes later, I see the girl (who I won't name) coming with the water.  She sees my mom has one and returns the water to the back. At this point, she comes and takes our order. We ordered a large pizza and full salad for us to share, and again I request a water. She takes our order back and we notice the table behind us who came in 10 minutes or more after us has already received their bread. I look at the girl (as she drops off their bread) and she goes to the kitchen and about 10 minutes later comes back with bread. She profusely apologizes for the delay and claims it's late because it had just come out of the oven. I again asked for water and she takes about 3 minutes but comes back with it. I ask for a straw, but long story short I never got one (thank god I had an extra straw in my purse). The food came (I might add super fast). We got the quickest food service! It was great, but honestly this has been probably the worst restaurant service experience I have had (due to her attitude and lack of service). The experience was so bad, I don't think my review would do it justice. Honestly for $20+ a person for dinner I will take my business elsewhere and get better service. I don't care how delicious the food is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Christine W.,"Albuquerque, NM",54,4,,5.0,7/30/2016,"I have eaten at this CPK more than a handful of times and I have never had a bad experience or a bad server.  The food is always good. I love their original BBQ chicken pizza & the butter cake.  I have never experienced a wait, even when it seems like it's busy.

Ramon V.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,11,,1.0,2/20/2017,Overpriced!!!  Purchased a wild mushroom pizza and chicken BBQ.  Thin sauce and toppings.  Pizza size have shrunk and toppings almost non existent.  Mushrooms shaved so thin we kept looking for them.  A restaurant past its prime cruising on its old reputation.  Never again!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Misha L.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,9,3,5.0,12/6/2016,"As someone who works in the service industry, I expect without complaint, that when I visit a popular restaurant during peek hours I will likely get mediocre service and best. The food will probably also not look or taste as good as would were the cooks to have sufficient time to put a little more love in to each dish. Thus I try to avoid such establishments during these hours. But alas, at 1pm on Monday, I was almost hungry enough to eat the shoes I had just purchased next door. So, I went somewhere I'd never been with low expectations... just to put anything outside of footwear into my stomach. The place was pretty packed, so a wait would have been understandable. Yet we were sat within 2 minutes of walking in and greeted by our server, Michelle, immediately upon taking our seats. She had an obviously hefty work load, yet remained just the right amount of friendly and attentive without ever appearing overwhelmed. She was memorable and enjoyable but never over stayed her welcome at our table... there's a fine balance by my perspective, and it takes a skilled server to maintain it. She was incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and it's detailed ingredients and willing to modify it to accommodate my fancy pants taste buds. Our drinks stayed full throughout. The food arrived in a timely manner and was absolutely with out flaw. I can say without hesitation that it was officially the very best gluten free pizza I've had in Albuquerque. So good, in fact, that I was far too busy eating it, to take a picture of it. Not to worry, I'll be back! Given the quality of the food and service, it was also very reasonably priced. This was an obviously well managed restaurant with quality people cooking and serving the food. Way to go CPK... I was blown away with satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Jen C.,"Albuquerque, NM",107,226,86,1.0,7/3/2015,"I really hate giving one star, it takes a lot for me to rate a business so low, but California Kitchen was a real bummer.  My mom and I ate there at about 1 pm so seating was fast.  Service was what earned the low rating.  It took a loooooooong time for our server to make contact.  When he was taking our order he unfortunately sneezed all over his hands, then immediately picked up the menus.  I went to the bathroom and washed my hands... ew.  He could have apologized and excused himself to clean up before touching stuff on our table.   The food was fair, it was exactly what you'd expect from a California Kitchen anywhere.  It wasn't spectacular and wasn't bad... just mediocre chain food.  It wasn't enough to bring us back.    I noticed my water glass had a big crack in it half way through the meal and asked the server to replace the glass, when he returned, the 2nd glass had a chip on the rim.  My mother's diet coke came iced in a seriously hot glass.  I think they must be taking glasses straight out of the washer steaming hot then putting ice and cold drinks inside.  I think that was a science experiment in high school.... glass cracks... is that called thermal shock maybe?  I can't remember it's been a long time since high school. After we finished about 215 our server was nowhere to be found but he had dropped off the check.  We assumed we needed to go to the front to pay so walked up to the register.  Several employees were at the register and no one interacted with us.  We asked if we could pay and a server stated ""I'm off the clock I can't touch your money.""  Ok, another option would be to say, ""let me find someone to assist you.""  Such a strange customer service approach at this CPK.   We finally were able to pay and leave.  Kind of a bummer of an experience.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Bob L.,"Rio Rancho, NM",49,302,783,5.0,7/24/2016,"This location os the very best CPK that I have been too, anywhere I California, and the funny thing is that its located in New Mexico! LOL This place looks the nicest of all CPK I have ever seen, its beautiful, perfectly maintained, has a proper sit-down restaurant look to it and is a comfortable environment to enjoy your evening in. The food is quite good and has a decent variety, with even more variety in its way, so its easy to find something for everyone. The very best part of this location is the service. This is the very best service of any CPK I have ever experienced, by far. Its more like the service in a five star restaurant. The staff is simply excellent. The Hostess greeted us with a smile, immediately welcomed us and got us to our table immediately. She made sure we were comfortable and made an effort to settle us into their lovely environment. Courtney, our waitperson, is charming, professional, kind, informative, patient and fast. We were exhausted from an all day outdoor event yesterday in one hundred degree weather. Not having seen a CPK menu in quite some time, it took a while for us to figure out what we wanted. To make it worse, we were so spent from all those ours in eh heat and sun that our brains just could not process the menu quickly yet Courtney patiently helped us muddle through it and gave us all the time we needed to get through it. Having just moved to New Mexico and getting lost on the way to Uptown, Courtney made us feel welcome to this State as well as to CPK. She exemplifies how service should be offered at a four and five star restaurant, and she sets the bar si very high for CPK. We intend on asking for her by name each time we visit CPK. She's that good. Courtney brought the dinner out so quickly I thought that I had just barely blinked my eye and her sunny smile was once again at our table, cheerfully serving and making sure that we were comfortable. The Garlic Cream Fettuccini was quite good and enjoyable as was the ""Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler"" (Fresh strawberries hand-shaken with Fresca and Monin South Seas, featuring natural flavors of mango, guava and ginger. Lite in calories too!), although it was a bit on the sweet side, it was definitely refreshing and the strawberries tasted like they came right out of the garden. This location has elevated CPK to the fine dining level, offering popular, yummy, meals. I you have not tried CPK do start with the BBQ chicken pizza, yes that really is a California thing (it was started in Los Angeles) and truly is quite tasty, but no matter which dish you go there for, you'll enjoy the excellent service environment that the manager of this location has created for you, he and his staff are to be commended on the excellence of their demeanor and service delivery which is what earned them five stars. Oh yes, there really is a Pokemon living in the outdoor seating area, he's rather friendly and is a good catch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20
Amanda C.,"Albuquerque, NM",205,84,50,4.0,4/12/2016,"California Dreamin... Love this place! Great,bright,fun,friendly atmosphere. They are located in the uptown shopping center which is nice especially on those summer days taking a stroll shopping. It's nice to pop in for a quick lunch or beverage. I've never tried any of their fancy drinks but they look delicious!! I usually order the peach tea with easy syrup because sometimes they pump so much that all you taste is straight sugar. Food wise, I've always stuck to the same two things which is the California veggie pizza and the veggie sandwich which both are great choices!! I need to venture off and try one of their salads next time. My favorite part of this place is the patio. In the warm summer months it's beautiful to sit outside and people watch while enjoying a great meal! They also have these awesome two parking spots in the back of the building that when you call in your order you can park there and they will run it out. It's nice because the parking at uptown is instant stress. Cars everywhere backing in and out, people fighting for spots it gets quite crazy sometimes.  Well I'll be back very soon now that the sun is back on our side. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20

Joanne L.,"Albuquerque, NM",37,154,42,3.0,2/5/2015,"Oh no California Pizza Kitchen tonight for the first time I realized why you only have a 3 star rating.... And that makes me sad.... Where shall I start??? How about with the service that's always a good starting point- well to be brutally honest the service was awful. It all started when the server went to seat us and I asked to sit some where else, I like to sit off to the side in a quite spot where my almost 2 year old isn't going to disturb other people but the server seemed put out by my request.... Sorry for been considerate didn't realize that was a bad thing :/  The second server failure was when our food arrived and we got the wrong pizza :/ so while everyone was tucking into there food my husband had to sit and watch and wait ok so mistakes happen I guess. The manager was great at following up kudos there. Your lack of thought on getting refills was just another example of the lack of service and having to wait a ridiculous amount of time to pay was just the icing on the cake.  Onto the food well it was just sub par nothing special, I usually over eat at CPK because the food is to delicious to pass up on another slice and an other and an other ok so you get the point, but tonight not so much 2 slices and I was done the flavor just wasn't there and the pizza was soggy. Overall this was an experience I regret spending $40 on and there is nothing more I hate then coming home with an empty wallet and feeling nauseous into the mix.... I am not sure if I can look past this experience and return, maybe our CPK journey is over.... And that makes me sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=20

It was all about the first impression and I let my... emotions... cloud my better judgement.  Will you give me another chance? During our first date, I didn't know about your fish tacos. I didn't even ask. To be fair, I was rushed. You were really sketchy and nervous, and it was awkward. I can look back on it with some perspective now, I mean it was a blind date, neither of us trusted the person that set us up, I figured you thought my Corolla was shabby so I was on the defensive... But can I just tell you: I still don't really like you, but if you make me more of those fish tacos, I'll totally compromise my better judgement. For those panko-battered nuggets of Ono heaven, drowned in your ""ranchito"" sauce and covered in layers of cabbage and avocado, I'd let you take advantage of me. I would, and I wouldn't have a complex the next day because you're from California so you're used to that kind of thing. And I don't know what happened, but during our second date, you were SO different.

When I arrived at the restaurant I was immediately greeted by a host and pointed to the register to order carryout. I decided on the California Club Pizza. The guy taking my order was super friendly and offered me a beverage while I waited for my pizza. It only took about 10-12 minutes to get my order and the gentleman who took it brought it right over to me. When I got back to my hotel, I was pleasantly surprised that they included some bread and olive oil with my pizza. They also put the toppings (mixed greens, avocado, and tomato) in a separate container which was nice. The pizza was very tasty and was way more than I could eat.

If you have a problem with animals in a restaurant then this might not be for you. The other issue was a busboy was sweeping right by our table while we were eating. I really hate that. The food was amazing, especially the warm butter cake. The waitress (Genesis) was awesome, she was personable, kept our glasses full and had our meal planned time planned perfectly.

Nicole N.,"Albuquerque, NM",54,54,22,4.0,7/24/2014,"CPK is a great place to go if you are craving something simple and delicious.  Salads, awesome. Soups, delicious. Pasta, YUM. Pizza, even better. It's a good mixture of eclectic dishes variying from italian fare to american comforts and asian twists. I've never had anything bad to eat here and it's always consistent.  It's a nice, clean restaurant. Even the bathrooms, which is a good judge on how the place is kept. The hosts/wait staff are always really nice. The only downside is that the restaurant will get slammed with customers! I believe that they do call ahead seating in case you are going on a typically busy night (F,S,S). Try the patio. It's in a nice shaded part of Uptown so you can people watch, or just enjoy the wonderful summer weather. All in all a good comfortable place to have a delicious meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=40

They have a very simple and straight forward kids menu of the small pizza little sliders or macaroni and cheese. My man and I ordered the pizza. The appetizers and chips and salsa and old reliable. The only thing I didn't like was that the cocktails are very much water-down with sparkling water or sparkling soda. The wait service was decent and the hostess was very welcoming and they also said goodbye when we left the restaurant.

The Good: The Jamaican Jerk pizza is my absolute favorite. Sweet and spicy, with crispy bacon and delicious peppers/onions. I like to order this with extra sauce. Also, when craving pasta, I order the chicken tequila fettuccine.  There was a shift manager here a while ago by the name of Pete, and he was the best. Entertaining, accommodating, and a pleasant person overall. Sad to hear that he'd left. The Meh: Service here is a hit or miss, sadly. You get seated almost immediately, but sometimes it takes a while for someone to actually approach your table. On my most recent visit, my bf and I waited over 15 minutes before someone came to our table outside and asked, ""You haven't been helped yet right?"" We ended up moving inside, due to wind. My water was never refilled, and I had to request it from the manager standing by the register (what we were eating was really spicy).

Rosanne L.,"Albuquerque, NM",53,97,693,3.0,1/9/2016,"The first time I visited this chain was around lunch time on New Years eve, so it was rather busy and there was a wait time of 20 minutes. But we (my mom, my brother and I)  were such in good spirits after purchasing a new iphone from the Apple store near this CPK restaurant that we didnt mind the wait.  It was quite busy that day, so maybe thats why the service suffered a little bit.  Out server was a little bit confused when sitting us. Apparently he was instructed to sit us at a certain table but that table was still dirty. He quickly found us another table though. He was also quick in providing us menus and getting out drinks and taking our orders. But he was rushed and forgot to provide my brother a drinking straw and it was hard to get his attention to this minor detail.  Also I've noticed that as compared to the other CPKs Ive been to (I travel accross US alot), this chain is subpar. It was too crowded, like they tried to fit in as many tables as they can compromising the ambience of the restaurant. It was also a full house that day so it was a bit loud with too many people. Another thing is their napkins. Other CPKs use real, cloth napkins, this establishment doesn't. They use brown, recycled paper napkins, which cheapens the whole dining experience. Anyways, shortly after giving our orders (like 10-15seconds later), we decided to ask for the menu again to order a pizza in addition to out previous orders of 3 jambalaya pasta and a share appetizer of chips and spinach/artichoke dip. The server was like ""okaayy.. Are you sure? If you say so,"" in an offensive tone implying that we are ordering too much. We missed breakfast, waking up late, and it was already 130pm so we were starving. Besides, ordering more should be good for their business, right? During the meal, it was hard to get our server's attention for drink refills. He was busy running around tables.  The food.  Chips + spinach and artichoke dip: 3stars. Chips were bland, after a sprinkle of salt, it was alright. The dip was delicious. Will probably order again. California Club pizza. 3stars. The white sauce was extremely lacking, it was dry. Fresh parmessan was grated right in front of us. The greens in top were really fresh though and the leftover remained fresh hours after taking it to go. Will most likely not order again.  Jambalaya pasta. One of my fave CPK dish. It was still good, spicy. with generous seafood toppings in the sauce. We had the freshly grated parmessan on it as well.  Overall , we will only probably go back to this restaurant again when we feel the need to fulfill our Jambalaya pasta fix again as this is the only CPK in town. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque

The staff is attentive, not overbearing, and they do a good job of rotating customers through the restaurant without making us feel rushed. The food is reasonably good, and you might have to come here a few times before you finally get a Pizza combination that makes you happier than a 50's enthusiast at a Marilyn Manroe Look-Alike Poodle Skirt Dance off competition. On a sad note, the restaurant seems to be completely devoid of any sort of deep dish diet-busting  cheesy-calorie-fest Sicilian or Chicago style pie that the name suggests they might carry. But don't let that scare you away. The real secret here is the soups. They are all absolutely knock your socks off. Try the chicken tortilla. That soup will heal the sick and quickly make you forget pizza is supposed to have Marinara and toppings you personally dictate, and should be thicker than your iphone. As suggestions for improvement: I think the wait time on the Pizzas is slightly excessive, even with ordered appetizers. I would hope that the restaurant would offer some bread to nosh on or perhaps some sliced Parmesan cheese as a pallet cleanser before the meal. Either of those things would be awesome with the wines that are served. A $25 combo pack with soup, a single pizza, a shared salad and two soft drinks as a date special would be awesome.

Donald B.,"Albuquerque, NM",361,25,14,2.0,8/16/2015,"Normally this place is very consistent with food and service. Not tonight. The adobo margarita was so weak! Mostly sour mix and chipotle adobo sauce. The salads took about 35 minutes with the restaurant mostly empty. Then a server comes right in the middle of our meal and wants to take away the salt, pepper, Parmesan and red pepper shakers so she (Marti) can do her side work. Please, interrupt my dinner so you can make your life easier. Listen, customer service should be about the guest and not what makes it easy for the staff. Too many restaurants operate one what is good and easy for them and not what is best for the guest. California Pizza Kitchen has become nothing more than a big chain with less focus on the guest and that is sad, I always had thought they were better than that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=60

She constantly checked on us and brought us whatever we wanted without hesitation even though she was very busy. The food was outstanding as always they never disappoint there, came out hot and delicious.

I had the Habanero Pizza which I was warned about by the menu and the waiter, both warned about its spicy tendency. Both the menu and the waiter must be from California because it wasn't spicy at all. Just because I am a spiceaholic of sorts I was disappointed because the habanero pepper has deadly and memorable potential.

Skip this place.  There is a total disregard for customer service at this location.  Coming from California, this CPK restaurant does not live up to its reputation.  There was no wait for us to be seated since we had dinner at 5pm.  There weren't many customers at that time, yet our waiter had flagrant disregard to the simple rules of good customer service.  Our simple order of pizza and salad took 40 minutes to get to our table, and the waiter offered no updates or compensation for the wait.  According to their new company policy (or maybe it's just at this location), they don't offer you their sourdough bread unless YOU ask for it.  Long story short, there are much better restaurants that will serve you better pizza and salad, where your dinner won't be ruined by crappy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=100
Kim B.,"Albuquerque, NM",10,25,,5.0,9/18/2009,"The meal last night was definitely 5 stars. I can't imagine anything that could have made it better. There was no wait and the hostess and our waitress were both very nice.  I had the Moroccan Chicken Salad with spiced butternut squash, beets, avocado, dates, carrots, almonds, egg and dried cranberries. It also had super tender flavorful chicken and it was all tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. Total win.  My friend had the Asparagus & Spinach Spaghettini with Shrimp. I had a bite and it was really good. Garlicy, oily and comforting.  We had dessert also. The waitress thought we were cute because we had the menu propped up so we could both see it and we were evaluating each option like it was something really important.  I had the Chocolate Banana Royale Cake. The cake was perfectly moist (sorry if you're offended by this word. Apparently there are a lot of you.) and that is rare. I'm not quite sure why it's so hard for restaurants to make a moist (sorry) cake, even bakeries and cupcakeries seem to have a hard time with this. CPK managed it perfectly. So combine the perfectly moist (sorry. last time, i promise) dark chocolate cake with banana cream, chocolate mousse and chocolate frosting and you've got yourself a reason to show up at CPK every single night to sit at the bar alone and eat chocolate cake and wonder how many months or years it will take before one barstool just isn't enough for your growing bottom. Sigh.  But maybe I'm wrong and you should listen to the other reviewers and not go there because there's a chance that you might have to wait or someone might be rude to you. Then again this could be my way of ensuring that I never have to wait for my seat (or two) at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-albuquerque?start=100
