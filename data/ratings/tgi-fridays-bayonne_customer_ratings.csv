7,Joe A.,"Bayonne, NJ",12,19,5.0,3.0,2012-10-04,"I know it's a Fridays, and so I try to keep my expectations in check. I have to say, though, that the service was my main complaint. The food was good, but our waitress was fairly apathetic. We didn't get utensils with our food, and she vanished immediately after delivering it, forcing us to have to flag down another one. We didn't see her much again for the duration of our meal, and for some time after, even as we sat waiting to order dessert. When she came back, she seemed eager to give us the check, and surprised that we wanted to order more. With any luck, it was just a fluke, or a result of choosing to sit at a table in the noisy bar area rather than wait for one in the proper dining section. It won't stop me from going back, but with Houlihan's a short drive away, and Longhorn Steakhouse in the same plaza, I've certainly got other choices if I should be in the mood for a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60,1.836,1.836,1.836,1.836,1.836

It never does. It actually gets worse everytime.  We came here last Friday evening. They were holding an event at the bar, no big deal, because we would have liked to sit in the dining area anyway. Well, this event must have thrown off all the servers, because they all looked like they didn't know what they were doing.  Our waiter took our orders. Forgot an appetizer. We decided not to even ask for it since he was already serving our entrees by the time he came our way. He would come to our table in a hurried manner and say ""how's the food? Okay great!"" Without even giving us a chance to respond or ask for extra napkins, ketchup, etc. The food was also horrible. With the exception of the appetizer. I ordered a medium well steak, which came out well done. It was dry and flavorless. I didn't finish it. The only think that I liked about my meal were the sides -- mashed potatoes and vegetables. Boring.  My boyfriend on the other hand, liked his fried shrimp. I mean, how could you mess those up. But then again, they looked like the same shrimp they serve at Popeyes.

This one in particular is probably THE WORST one to go to. The service is horrible. The servers could care less about your needs and are extremely slow. First time going I got myself a rib rack. It was burnt to a crisp, to the point of being not edible. The second, and last time I will ever go there, I ordered a burger. It was very slow that day, so I was expecting to at least have my meal in a decent time. NOPE. The appetizer (nachos) still took about half an hour by itself. And the entree (burger) took another half hour after that. In that time, our server only came to us to bring the food. Never to see if we needed anything. Seeing as I sat for half an hour waiting for a plate of nachos to come out, I went through my drink before it had arrived. That said, the server didn't even ask if I wanted a refill. Just a quick plop of the plate on the table, and back to chatting to her coworkers she went. Needless to say, never again.

She's the type that if you piss her off, she'll probably spit in your food. Some of us ordered apps as meals and others got burgers, we asked for them to be served at the same time. She did it separately anyway so our table were all eating at different times, we asked her why this happened and she denied that we ever asked for it to be served that way. She served us and charged us for a meal that we canceled. She again denied that we canceled it. She didn't give us napkins, so we tried to get her attention, we hear yelling from behind the bar. Apparently our waitress and 3 others were back there telling some story, acting ghetto, and cursing. My mother walks back there and then she came acting like we were bothering her. She gave us attitude the whole time. Honestly I come to fridays only cuz of this deal but my stomach turns when I see that she's our server. Please fire her!

I have been here on 4 occasions since it opened and I either leave here feeling 'meh' or disappointed.  Let me tell you about my last experience...  First, I only went because I had a gift card to use. My husband and I went on a Sunday evening and it was not busy at all. Usually there is a crowd of people waiting to be seated. When we walked in, the hostess was not at her station.  We stood there for literally 5 minutes. A girl walks over to the hostess station, doesn't even acknowledge us, & proceeds to refill the crayon bin. We awkwardly stand there for another few minutes just kind of looking at her. Finally I say, 'Excuse me, Are you the hostess'? and she nods. I hold up my hand and say, 'Two, please' and she says ...... 'I know.' ( WTF) and goes back to restocking the crayons. After she was done, she finally seated us.  The place was pretry empty, only a few tables and as we were being seated, I couldn't help but notice dirty tables throughout the entire restaurant - at least 5 with empty plates of food left on them. Disgusting.  When our waitress comes over, she takes our drink order... brings me my selzter right away but doesn't bring my husbands beer for 10 minutes. Another waiter came by, introduced himself, & also asked for our drink order. They had to figure out who was going to get our table. Our waitress kept grabbing our glasses by the rim of the cup (my husband pointed it out - pretty unsanitary).  The food was generic chain food - nothing that spectacular.   After my last experience,  I am pretty sure I will never be returning to this place (unless it is to visit the bar and eat unhealthy appetizers, which would be rare, but is probably all this place is good for if you fancy that type of stuff).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60,1.84,1.84,1.84,1.5080000000000002,1.8400000000000003

We had the unlimited appetizers for the first time ($10 for all you can eat of any one of 6 different appetizers). My son had the boneless chicken wings & was able to switch back & forth between the various flavors (bbq, jack daniels, buffalo) every time he asked for more. I had the mozzarella sticks & farnkly, there are only so many of those you can eat, so I'm not sure it was worth it for me. My little guy had his favorite of course - mac 'n cheese which he inhaled! The best part of the evening was our server, Q, who was professional, friendly, interacted with my kids, & even got me to order dessert (which I never do here since the food is so calorie laden to start with). My boys devoured the brownie sundae, but luckily I was able to taste one bite of the brownie - which for someone like me who LOVES chocolate, it was amazing. While the food is your regular chain food, the servers overall & specifically Q elevate this to a 5 star experience, particulary if you want to grab a quick bite with friends or if you're taking the kiddies out.  Overall, the unlimited appetizer deal is good if you order the boneless wings AND if others in your party also order this promo, so that you can all share.

Waitress walked by to get us beer and food and seemed of no interest to serve us. I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich and wifey got the chicken fajitas along with the white Apple sangria. Who serves sangria with a million ice cubes in it? While the burger tasted ok ( that's what the one star is for ) it was served cold probably had a 5F temperature. Horrendous. The fajitas were rubbish. Oh the Black beans come cooked in water without any flavor.  They were supposed to serve chipotle glazed chicken but I did not see any such thing on it. The rice was surely Uncle Ben's packaged rice. Totally tasteless and bland.

I was excited to order a meal that I haven't tried which was the Pecan Crusted Salad. It was noted in the menu that it was a favorite to other. So I felt relieved in ordering it. Now, the restaurant was empty and the waiter was very confident in his customer service which was refreshing. But that refreshing moment did not last. There were mistakes made. One being the wait time for the food was not right because no one was around. Second was the service checking in on the customers. Third was the food being mediocre and the pecan crusted chicken being cold. I asked for them to warm it up. Rather than warm and make it again, they warmed it in the microwave. Which made the chicken tougher than what it was and looked inedible.

This place has gone down hill quicker than a fat kid on ice down a 80 degree slope. This is our go to spot when we are in Bayonne and want something to eat. Usually during their happy hour. When the place first opened up, it was on point. Refills came without being asked for, food was on point and staff was awesome. Nowadays, people walk around with just a tee shirt on, practicing juggling behind the bar with the fake bottle or just have you wondering where your waiter/waitress is.  We come in, hostess greets us and we ask to sit at the bar because of Happy Hour and half price apps and see tells us to choose our seat as usual and we do. So we sit down, utensils are on the table ready for use BUT the table was as sticky as the underside of a high school cafeteria table. There were still some leftovers from the previous patron as well and we were given no menus.  Beforehand, our waitress is walking past us as we are walking to our table to what I'm assuming is another one of her tables and I'm assuming they were either another pair of regulars like ourselves or friends. She was talking with them for over 15 minutes. I'm saying our waitress, because there was no one else waiting tables in that section and there were only 5 tables being used and about 5 people at the bar side with their drinks and food, but the bartender I know waits those there. We waited about 10 of those minutes cause we weren't in a rush as it was the end of our day, but we are thinking, man we haven't even been offered a menu let alone a glass of water! So I suggest we sit bar side, but guess what?! We hadn't seen the bartender since we came into the establishment either! So we contemplated what should we do for 5 minutes and my gf said eh let's give them 2 minutes before we just leave. I turned to her and said nope, we are leaving. We got up and started walking out and the same hostess sends us out with a thank you for coming, hope you had a good meal and we respond by telling her we would've had to been served first in order to have a meal first, let alone a good meal.

Ordered the first app, the Braised Beef Nachos (forget exactly what they're called, but they were essentially nachos). Came with 4 round crispy tortillas with meet, cheese, and slaw. Not bad, but not the best nachos I've ever had. Probably would not order these as a stand alone app. Moved on to the green been fries. I enjoyed these. Though I regret eating as many as I did by myself. The sauce on the side is alright (wasabi mayo?)... ended up going ketchup with extra pepper instead. Ordered my second beer - Lagunitas IPA (large). Not bad pricing, but definitely more expensive than the PBR. 3rd ap: Boneless wings. Tasted really good, maybe a little too salty and the memphis bbq was a little too sweet for my liking. The sriracha buffalo is a little more my speed (I've had these in the past at this location). Avoid the PBJ wings like the plague (again, something I had once ordered in the past at this location). And finally the 4th ap: The Tuscan Spinach dip. Really tasty, the dip at least. Some of the chips weren't crispy and were kind of oily as if they were cooked in oil that wasn't quite hot enough. At this point I wasn't hungry enough to ask for them to be replaced. I only ate about a 1/4 of this before I finished my meal. Overall, decent. You should understand that when you go to Friday's you're getting an upscale ""fast food"". I wouldn't be surprised if not a single one of these apps didn't go from frozen to the fryer to my plate.

No way in any establishments have I been spending money especially a group of six and be disrespected or rushed after ordering food and drinks . Save your money for better service unless it's Quincy who is the shorter dark skin bartender/waiter who is so kind and professional and cool! thank you Quincy!!!!

We shared the Sesame Jack Chicken Strips, which were absolutely delicious. I had a very tasty Veggie Burger. Service was quick, very friendly. Bathrooms were spotless, too.  I can't imagine what the whiney complainers were writing about.

As a well known restaurant chain you usually can't go wrong, so I by passed Yelp reviews. One day I'll learn!!! So I'm alone and I ask for a booth. After a 3 minute walk around the restaurant and passing several empty booths I'm finally seated. I ordered a drink, Strawberry Passion Fruit tea which was really good. No free refill but that's OK because the glass it pretty large. Next I ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken. Oh yes I forgot to mention only two other tables occupied in my section. 20 minutes later my meal finally comes.  Am I too impatient?  I don't think so. It's lunchtime, working people don't have all day. Several places promise short wait times for lunch, but apparently this restaurant didn't get the memo. Well I will say the meal was pretty good and if I were to patronize another TGIF, I'd probably order it again. BTW. Friday's used to have a ""Stripes"" club. I joined some years ago and apparently they would ask if you were a member and you got points, for what I have no idea. I guess that program fizzled out.

Manager was kind enough to discount the plate. That was extremely comforting. Staff can be heard from the kitchen spewing profanity and laughing.
