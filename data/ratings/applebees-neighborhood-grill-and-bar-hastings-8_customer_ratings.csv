7,Tracy W.,"Hastings, MI",0,3,,3.0,2015-03-15,"If you're looking for good food, its an option, but it's definitely not my first choice. It's pretty average food, but it's pricey. Our waitress was amazing and patient, since we had to have three drinks, each, go back due to brown floaties of something. We declined the offer of having the manager come see us, though they are supposed to anyways, they offer a $5 off coupon on your next meal if the manager does not come to your table. We didn't mention that since we didn't plan on returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hastings-8,,,,,

3,Kayla D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,130,5.0,4.0,2015-09-15,"Updating my review, because they have updated their menu.  We went in recently, with several gift cards to blow. We weren't sure when we'd be back, so we went all out.  Starting with appetizers, they stepped up their mozzarella stick game. They taste a little better than before, and not one was soggy. We also tried their pretzels with beer cheese, that was amazing. We dipped everything we could in the cheese once the pretzels were out.  We chose the 2 for $20 menu for our entree. I had the grilled chicken penne, which was very filling and topped with fresh tomato and basil. My friend had the four cheese macaroni, which had a sweet style crispy chicken on top. My fiance had the chicken tender meal, which was about as good as chicken tenders can be. We also got extra fries, which were only $2 for a large platter, definitely worth it.  My original score was 3 stars, because the steak was gristle and everything was half assed. Now, they have made a definite improvement and I plan on returning. They're still a chain, but the great service we got more than made up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hastings-8,,,,,
6,Anne A.,"East Lansing, MI",4,39,,2.0,2015-10-10,"If you're looking for a bargain, don't look here.  The food is mediocre, but the prices are high.  $6 for a drought beer?  That's a little steep.  Signature cocktail was $7 for a high-ball glass.  Side of fries was sparse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hastings-8,,,,,
5,DJ C.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,45,63.0,3.0,2016-04-23,"Our waiter was very friendly and polite. The food was ready and served within an appropriate time frame. The Wonton tacos as an appetizer was really good! We had the Bourbon chicken and shrimp along with the quesadilla burger. The burger was taste but a bit messy. I would not recommend eating the burger as a take out or to go as the quesadilla gets soggy quick.  The Bourbon Street chicken and shrimp were tasty as well. The one huge downfall with my quesadilla burger was the onion rings that I ordered as a side. It was an up charge to get the onion rings, however definitely not worth it. They were extremely doughy and appeared to be under cooked. I would definitely pass on the onion rings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hastings-8,,,,,
2,Richard J.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,13,16.0,1.0,2016-12-14,Five of us stopped in for my sisters B-day. Everyone's food was cold but mine. It was cooked wrong and they had to remake it. Rice was hard and tasteless. Don't think we'll be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hastings-8,,,,,
1,Mitchell S.,"Hastings, MI",0,2,,1.0,2017-07-10,"All I can say is that this Applebees needs to have higher standards when it comes to hiring servers. We had ""Jordyn"" as our server and he was hands down THE WORST waiter I have ever had. So disrespectful and rude. Never again will I go back to this Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hastings-8,,,,,
