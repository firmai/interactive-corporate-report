20,Robert B.,"Chester, VA",760,419,1380.0,3.0,2012-04-27,"Well we decided to try Chili's tonight, it's been years sense we have visited one. When we walked in we were greeted by two young ladies and then promptly seated. The seats had not been cleaned because salt was all over them so we cleaned our seats. We then placed our drink orders my wife a cool Blue Hawaiian and myself a tall Fat Tire draft. And looked at the menu and my wife chose the country fried steak which came with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. My choice was the grilled salmon which came with steamed broccoli. My wife's plate was full and mine looked a little skimpy. Now down to the good stuff I wasn't impressed with my meal the broccoli was ok the salmon was bland like it was missing some spices. You know this is suppose to be a south west establishment, Chili's should be spicy. Now my wife's meal was good but nothing to jump up and down about, the corn was spicier than my salmon what gives. The best part of our outing were the drinks. The waitress did a fine job of tending to our needs, but other wise I was disappointed in the food. I was looking for something spicy and I didn't find it here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester?start=20,,,,,
16,Andrea S.,"Chesterfield Court House, VA",5,14,3.0,2.0,2014-02-18,"I am giving 2 stars because the food is good but the service is probably the worse service.  We have been several times (b/c we like the food) but the service is always poor.  There never seems to be host on duty and waiters will just walk by without acknowledging guest.   Our last visit was just humorous, the waiter kept standing and watching a game, he held a guest's ticket for about 10 min watching the tv before he gave it to them.  I felt bad for who had him as their waiter.  Good food but bad  service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
14,Lynn P.,"Petersburg, VA",22,25,26.0,5.0,2014-03-22,I like Chili's live the salads burgers everything in the menu is great so far.  Today the noise is actually at the perfect level!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
19,Myles H.,"Chester, VA",0,20,,1.0,2014-07-02,"On Thursday, June 26th, my wife and I visited Chili's. Upon entry, we were promptly greeted, then seated with very few customers in the dining area. The bar area was pretty busy which is typical during Happy Hour. Our waiter took our drink orders (ice tea) and we ordered our entrée's. My wife ordered chicken fajitas (her norm) and I ordered wings over buffalo and loaded potato skins. After our arrival, a couple was seated in an adjacent booth and she also ordered chicken fajitas. I'm unsure what he ordered. Needless to say, their food arrived prior to our food arriving. After seeing the chicken fajitas, she asked her waitress to have the cook grill her chicken because it was still white. The waitress told her that Chili's changed the way the cooks prepare the fajitas and also stated they grilled the chicken for 70 seconds. She also shared that if she wanted the chicken the way it used to be served, have the cook grill the chicken on the flat top. Her order came out and she stated it was perfect. Our order still had not arrived. Our order arrived and my wife's chicken was white and she promptly asked the waiter could he have the cook grill the chicken on the flat top. My meal was fine and I started eating my entrée, thinking her chicken would come to the table pretty quickly. Her meal took considerably longer than anticipated. The manager brings her meal to the table and the chicken and vegetables were now burned and our neighbor adjacent to us stated ""those fajitas smelled burned."" My wife shared her disapproval and the manager asked the waiter to retake her order. I stopped eating my meal because I am now frustrated.  My wife ordered a rack of baby back ribs, half Memphis dry rub and the other original bbq. We tell the waiter to place them in a ""to go"" container because our stay is now pretty lengthy. The couple who arrived after we did is now leaving. The ribs arrive and they are half Memphis dry rub and half honey and chipotle. We tell our waiter the error and he abruptly states ""I wrote down what you said."" His response shocked me. I told him, ""I'm unsure why you wrote what you did, but my wife didn't order that, she does not eat honey."" At this point I said ""bring the check"" and stated we will not patronize this Chili's again. This Chili's has a strong bar crowd and I guess management does not care about the service rendered in the dining area. In addition, the food has been going downhill for several months and for us, has hit rock bottom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
12,Chris P.,"Chester, VA",83,236,124.0,3.0,2014-12-15,"The new menu items and decor is definitely an upgrade from the previous options. The fried pickles and chipotle fresh mex bowls were really good and a nice change of pace from their normal menu items. The staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining the new items. The self-check out tablet was pretty cool due to the games and constant restaurant information that it provides, but if you're paying in cash, it doesn't really help. I would recommend stopping by to check out their new menu, but wouldn't go out of my way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
15,Marie E.,"Chester, VA",0,4,,4.0,2015-03-10,Chili's is okay. They have good hamburgers. Their not dry. Their chicken is good but kinda greasy. I am not a fan of too much grease. My sister in law loves chicken and always orders the chicken sandwich. The price is reasonable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
17,Lady R C.,"Fort Lee, VA",31,5,4.0,5.0,2015-06-06,Food is always amazing.  I love the chicken bacon ranch quesadillas.  Every meal i've had here has been great! The servers are amazing as well! Excellent customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
21,Fam T.,"Richmond, VA",0,11,1.0,1.0,2015-06-22,"Absolutely the worst Chili's I've ever been to.  Would not even give 1 star if I could.  We have tried this restaurant several times in the hopes that it would get better and will not go back again.  Each time it has gotten worst.  The last time the waiter was slow and clueless.  We are such laid back people that you have to be pretty bad to get a bad review from us and this was beyond pretty bad!!!  The waiter was more concerned about watching a lip syncing tv show than serving us!  The food was horrible.  Ordered the buffalo chicken salad.  The lettuce was out of a bag old, limp and brown.  Not fresh at all and there was no bleu cheese.  After 15 minutes we flagged down our waiter and he brought us feta cheese.  Who doesn't know the difference between feta cheese and bleu cheese, especially when you are working in a restaurant.  We never got two drinks we ordered and just gave up trying.  Done trying with this restaurant.  There are too many other options!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester?start=20,,,,,
6,Alexandra H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,14,11.0,2.0,2016-05-09,"I can tell just by how long it takes to be seated and asked what we'd like to drink, to have an idea of how the experience/meal will go.  Right away, I knew it was going to be a crappy one. First, we were seated at a table that hadn't even been cleaned and had food literally all over the floor. It took at least 15 minutes to get our drinks and give our order. For how bland the food was, it was NOT worth the 40 minute wait. The service was very mediocre, out waitress unfortunately acted as though she really didn't want to be there. The only reason I'm giving this 2 starts is because the nachos were actually quite good. Still took a while to get, but good nonetheless.  However, not enough to return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
7,Jeffrie G.,"York, PA",6,7,3.0,5.0,2016-05-28,"Half rack Baby back ribs with salad bowl and mini molten. Good bang for buck 10.99$ Easy seating, Service was quick, Good taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
11,Ryan K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",3,21,,3.0,2016-06-15,"I went in and sat at the bar.  The bartender was nice.  She was prompt with service.  The food came out hot and fresh.  I ended up taking it to go.  They put on the OJ Simpson documentary at full volume!  I've honestly never seen that happen in any bar area of any restaurant.  I saw one guest leave, a couple complain, and then I asked why the volume was on for this particular program...she said, ""...it was sports related.""  About  five seconds after my question...the N-word was yelled on the program.  Nothing was done.  She didn't have the wherewithal to realize she was alienating the majority of the guests she was serving.  I notified the manager on the way out, which I never do.  He was SUPER nice and SUPER understanding.  Atmosphere is the only reason I didn't give a higher rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
10,Rudy B.,"Chester, VA",25,20,,2.0,2016-08-01,"Once the Server got my order right (took a while), it was good, flavorful food. Service was just ok...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
9,J.E. V.,"Jacksonville, NC",39,36,31.0,2.0,2016-08-05,"This place was mediocre at best. We were seated as soon as we walked in (we asked for a booth and there were plenty open but the said they had no servers for them). The atmosphere was decent but when we look under our table it was gross on the floor near our feet. It was happy hour and not crowded but not empty either. The hostesses were ok but seemed to just tolerate guest not really excited to see customers. The server was ok but never smiled, not even once. The drinks and appetizers came out super fast, the food not so much. By the time we got the food I t was warm borderline cool at best. I would not visit this place again based on all the reasons above...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
4,Kristan R.,"Colonial Heights, VA",19,17,3.0,2.0,2016-09-03,"Haven't eaten here in years and now I remember why. I ordered takeout for myself and 3 people at my work place earlier for lunch and it was awful.  First of all. They open at 11, I called to place my order at 11:05. I ordered and picked up the food by 11:30 because they told me to give them twenty minutes to get it ready. I work less than 3 minutes away. All of our fries were cold and stale and obviously not from the same day. There's no way the fries had gotten that disgusting within the thirty minutes they were open before I got my food. They were yesterday's fries.  I ordered something called a chicken crisper and it was soggy and drowned in sauce.  We all ended up throwing most of our food away. I meant to call earlier and voice our complaints. Will do so tomorrow.  The food is also pretty pricey. We ordered off the lunch menu but we paid like 16 or 17 bucks each which I feel is more off like a dinner entree price.  Only gave them two stars because the girl who rang me up was pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
8,Marie E.,"Colonial Heights, VA",0,64,,4.0,2016-09-05,"Chili's is okay. I like their chicken platters and also their hamburgers. However I am not a great fan but like I said before, it's okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
3,Roderick R.,"Manassas, VA",27,67,5.0,5.0,2016-11-07,"As far as chain restaurants go this one nails it! The servers are polite, knowledgeable about their menu (food and drink), and quick to ensure everything was prepared correctly.  Price is average for a restaurant such as this though their happy hour specials are pretty darn good.   It is awesome when even management will occasionally come by to check for quality of the experience.  The to-go experience is the same, quick accurate and awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
1,Donna I.,"Richmond, VA",92,99,150.0,1.0,2017-02-05,We were a party of 7 so I expected a wait. Our silverware was dirty. It took awhile for our salads to arrive so I figured our food was gonna be slow too. Then the temperature was freezing. Service was slow. Don't see us coming back here again. Why was the ribs cold. Steak was tough,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
13,Lori T.,"Bon Air, Richmond, VA",86,1,,1.0,2017-04-12,Came in for dinner last night around 9:30 we waited at the host stand for about 5 minutes before someone greeted us. While we were waiting to be sat we watched two servers standing over a table of other co workers and looked at us but never acknowledged that we were standing there waiting to be sat. Finally someone came from the back and sat us. The server came to the table and got our drink order and brought those back promptly at that time we ordered an appetizer because we were both SUPER hungry. After we looked at the menu for a few we then ordered our entrees. We waited and waited and waited for our appetizer and 20 minutes go by and our server brings out our fajita sides and that's when I asked her if she forgot to ring in our app? She looked at me like I was the stupid one and even asked if we even ordered one? She then said oh yeah I forgot and said sorry. At that time we didn't want it anymore since our entrees were coming out. It takes a lot for me to get upset over stuff like this because I was a server for 15 years and I am now a service manager of a Chain Restaurant. At that time my boyfriend asked for more tortillas and the server told us they now come with four and are we sure we wanted more. (Mind you when opened there were only three in there) Anyways like I said i understand the server struggle and things happen but good lord why wasn't a manger involved? I never even seen someone that resembled a manager. No one was even doing table touches to make sure our experience was enjoyable. I can honestly only fault our server so much because she wasn't even being managed. The hourlies were running the show. Unfortunately we will not be returning to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
5,Nickalaus G.,"Salisbury, NC",132,22,,1.0,2017-04-26,"I got there at 7 pm.  Was told that the kitchen was backed up.  Half the restaurant was empty. They refused to let me sit at the bar.  They said they had to force me and the 15 other people waiting to wait 15 minutes each and to ""hold the door"".  So you would have to wait 15 minutes before you could even sit at an empty table. And then you had to wait standing up during this 15 minutes.  Really chilis. That's bad business.  #fail @chilis #badservice",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
2,Doreen P.,"South Chesterfield, Bermuda, VA",8,19,,1.0,2017-07-08,"When our food finally arrived (about 20 minutes after the people around us got theirs and they arrived way after us) the food was at best average.  The waitstaff lacked any concern for a tip.  When our bill finally arrived, it was on a dirty (more like filthy) tray, up-side-down on the table.  We're locals.  Not travelers coming up and down 95.  We're done.  Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
0,Jahnay M.,"Richmond, VA",16,234,258.0,3.0,2017-10-08,"My mom and I wanted to place a to go order since we were in the area. Their online to go wasn't working so we had to go inside and place our to go order. They seemed short of staff when we went inside although it wasn't too busy, but the bar area had a good amount of people for an afternoon, (Much quicker to call in the order versus waiting) The hostess was attentive when we walked in. We didn't wait too long maybe 20 mins or so. The food was fresh. We did the 2 for $22 meal option that comes with an appetizer (house salads were good), and two entrees. All in all not bad. Not sure if I'd go out of my way to come to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chester,,,,,
