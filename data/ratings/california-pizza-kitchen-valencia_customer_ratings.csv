I have never ordered something from this place that I didn't like! The chinese chicken salad, BBQ chicken pizza, and key lime pie are the hands down best on the menu. I get excited just thinking about them. The waiters are always in a good mood. Very prompt and proffessional.

187,Kevin L.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",349,617,215.0,4.0,2012-02-19,"I've always loved CPK. I love pizza and I love innovation, and CPK always has both. This location is beautiful. I've passed by many times but have never stopped by. I'm glad I did. There's a lot to do in this shopping center and the location is majestic and has great views. When I stopped in with a friend, the restaurant wasn't too busy. We were greeted instantly and the hostess was very friendly. The restaurant itself was decorated in typical CPK fashion, but this location was far more beautiful inside (and outside) than the others I have visited. Our server, Jared, was great. We weren't at the table two minutes before he took our drink orders. Around five minutes later he took our food order after bringing our drinks. He was friendly as well. When I go to CPK, I like to try whatever new pizzas are on the menu. My staples (that you can never go wrong with) are the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza, Cheeseburger pizza, Chipotle Chicken pizza, California Club pizza, and the Thai pizza. This time, I tried the Habanero Carnitas pizza on honey wheat crust. This one was good, I'd give it a B+/A-. The pizza came out perfectly cooked and the toppings were evenly spread. The habanero salse came on the side, which hit me as weird at first but made complete sense. Unfortunately, that's where the pizza lost some points. The salsa was bland and definitely not spicy, which was disappointing. I'm a sucker for spice so luckily, my old girlfriend Cholula, came to the rescue. The carnitas were great on top, the cheese and sauce were perfect and the crust was a delicious, slightly sweet addition to the whole thing. I'm pretty satisfied. Overall, the experience here was great. I'll definitely be back for the views, service, and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=160,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.3120000000000003,2.96

But the last time I went, all the kung pao spaghetti we ordered was cold and undercooked. When we called the manager over to our table, the manager came and talked to us about the spaghetti. We told him it was undercooked and cold and he asked us if we wanted another order. What kind of question is that? Obviously if something is not met to one's need, it's your job to offer a replacement. You can't ask such a question to a customer. Honestly, that one time ruined my visits and I haven't been there since, but all the other positive times make up for this one time.

The most innovative pizza I had ever tried.  I was so pleased to find a place that made little kid pizzas with whole wheat crust - so when I was in Santa Clarita I stopped by this location of the franchise and it was so like Denny's I couldn't believe it. It was noisy.  Service was so-so.  The menu had changed, there was no Thai style pizza, unless that had only been a Hawai'i thing. I guess any restaurant, even a place at the mall in Hawai'i is going to look prettier than a place on the mainland - but still - I was disappointed with the very plain decor, the cheap looking lighting fixtures.  For what you get the pizza seems overpriced. On the plus side you can easily find a parking space.  It's on the way out of Santa Clarita no near the crazy traffic jam that centers around their mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=180,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.9840000000000004,3.0800000000000005

Pizza Kitchen location has a dedicated to-go order area inside, so one might think they are proficient at these kinds of orders. Nope! I really should have been a jerk and been like ""okay, I see my order is bagged up, but you need to take it all out and prove to me that all the food is there."" Upon returning to the office, I soon discovered that a full salad was missing, and only the roasted vegetable part of the ""roasted vegetable salad"" was included. So basically three salads were missing. Although my food was good, it's not worth incurring the wrath of unhappy coworkers when CPK happily charges you for your full order but forgets to include 20% of that order.

167,Liz W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",24,76,30.0,4.0,2012-06-11,"Every time we eat here, I get the Miso Shrimp Salad. It's so good! It's light and healthy tasting, but so tasty with the avocado all mixed in. The portions are on the small side. The quality of the food is yummy- for example their spaghetti bolognese is quite good even though you'd think their specialty would be pizza, and that a place like Olive Garden should serve better tasting pasta than CPK but no it's totally the other way around.  The prices are on the high side for the amount of food. We're usually not totally satiated unless we're eating here not all that hungry in the first place. And then our bill is quite on the higher side of what we like to spend on a typical night out. So this tends to be a problem, and why we don't visit very frequently. We get the meal gift cards at a discount at Costco. That helps. If you go when it's really nice out, then either before or after your meal you can walk around and look at the ducks or sit on one of their benches and enjoy the weather or take a stroll over the little bridge and peer into the man-made lake.

115,Ailyne H.,"Valencia, CA",665,447,2370.0,3.0,2012-08-12,"Every now and then I find myself coming back to CPK time and again. They are obviously doing something right and upon my last visit they really 'wowed"" me. My sister, my nephew and I got got seated in their outside patio. Good choice as my nephew can't sit still for too long. My sis and I were able to take turns walking out the little side gate and take him to the man-made pond to feed all the ducks. I'm pretty sure this particular CPK has a lot of overhead with the complimentary bread they serve. Anyway, we only waited about five minutes (maybe less) before the manager came rushing out and apologized for the wait. I think since a nearby table had already complained they had been sitting out there for 10 mins and no one came by, the manager already assumed us to be in the same boat. I didn't mind. So, we got around to ordering: Chicken tequila fettuccine: God, I just love this dish. The richness and the lime, oooh-weee, it's carb-a-licious heaven! Sis got the chicken lettuce wraps... always a good, light and refreshing choice. I half-guiltily enjoyed my pasta and discarded any regrets of remorse because it was so damn good! We also each had a drink before our meal, I went with red wine and she got the strawberry basil mojito? Maybe I'm getting the name wrong, but she liked it. It was refreshing for a hot day and it had a nice kick to it! As were finishing up our meal, the manager comes back out (she'd already checked back on us a few times) to ask if we need any boxes, hands me a dessert menu and says ""Pick out a dessert, it's on us as we are sorry to have kept you waiting"".  WOW!!! Talk about AWESOME customer service!! I was floored. We weren't trying to get a freebie, but by chance, it fell into our laps!! WHY?? Because...because my friends, that's how you take care of your patrons... by making up for something they felt they were lacking WITHOUT you the patron having to ask for it! AMAZING.

104,Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,801,7330.0,2.0,2013-06-02,"(Dined 05/29/13 W @ 1:00pm): Pizza should be considered its own food group! The month of May's installment of ""Brand Specialists flee the coop for lunch get away"" found us at the California Pizza Kitchen located in the Bridgeport Marketplace. This location was far enough from our work campus so we didn't have to worry about running into other colleagues. After all, this was our time to get caught up with each other, aired any grievances about work, and generally sat back and let loose in the comfort and solace amongst ourselves. As you know, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants for various reasons, but that's about all you'd find in ""Awesometown"". Our party of seven requested to sit in the outdoor patio and took advantage of the nice warm and breezy weather. Once we arranged a couple tables and settled in with menus in-hand, this was how the lunch break broke out...for me, anyway:   Caribbean Sunset Sangria ($8.00) - The mango puree caught my attention (as would anything with this fruit from the Gods) and I loved my frou-frou drinks. The drink arrived in a glorious vibrant orange color with blueberries and various wedges of fruit throughout, white wine, and apple juice that filled-out the goblet this was served in. As tasty as it was, it was short on the wine and alcohol as good sangria should leave one with a sugary fuzzy buzz, which this sadly didn't.      Habanero Carnitas Original Crust Pizza ($13.00) - To this day I've yet ordered any entrée other than pizza (heck, it's in it's name!; I've boycotted the beef dishes at El Pollo Loco on principle alone!). This small-sized pie consisted of slow-roasted pulled pork and housemade cilantro pesto with a side of ""seriously spicy habanero salsa"". I enjoyed everything about the pizza except the fact that the habanero was served on the side. I truly expected it to be marinated with the pork and not as an afterthought or condiment. Again, if it's in the name I expected it cooked with it. I wouldn't expect a separate dish of orange sauce at a Chinese restaurant if I ordered orange chicken! And the ""seriously spicy..."" was a complete exaggeration of the habanero sauce as it was more like a purring kitten...very tame.  Bread with Olive Oil Dipping Sauce (complimentary) - What can be said other than it's free, you could ask for more if you wanted, and I simply loved bread. That's it! Service - Overall, I was disappointed with the service, and I hoped they just happened to be short-staffed. Half of our party arrived and we requested to be seated out on the patio. I noticed only a table of two was being used yet we still had to wait, even after our entire party arrived. Then, granted we weren't immediately ready to place our respective orders and needed more time, our waitress took 15 minutes (yes, I timed it because I used to work in the service sector) which was unacceptable. We got our drink and food orders relatively quick, as well as the check once we were done, but they were slow on filling our water glasses and refillable drinks during our meal. Parking - This was a breeze since they shared an open lot that had a ton of spaces with other businesses in this marketplace.  Overall, California Pizza Kitchen was generic and very formulaic. With so many better gourmet pizza options out there these days, I felt CPK's been left in the dust. They did own this niche back in the 90's but didn't seemed to evolve. I found minimal value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (my total bill was around $21.00 before tip), but when the few positives was the complimentary bread, that's a major issue. The atmosphere, décor, and ambience was modern inside with many booths and tables/chairs that filled the dining area. There was also a eating bar area that looked into the kitchen and pizza ovens. The outside patio was like someone's backyard with uncomfortable chairs and heating lamps for those cooler days or evenings. Since it was right at the corner of a busy intersection, the car traffic noise at times made it difficult to converse, but the sun and breeze felt nice. And, there were several TVs both indoor and outdoor, great for big sporting events. The attire was totally casual so normally I'd be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops. And they accepted my credit card of choice...AMEX!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=100,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.536,3.4800000000000004

CON #1 at this particular CPK, seems to be filled with a LOT of young children, with parents who neglect to notice when their high pitched screams, running around, kicking the booth seats, jumping etc. We have had to ask to relocate to a less rambunctious area of the restaurant. And now when we arrive, the 1st thing we say after how many in our party is...""PLEASE seat us where there are no screaming children"", then we pray the next hostess does not seat that same issue in our area. CON #2 is the price of their wine. We really enjoy our wine, but we've come to realize drinking water is our better option at CPK. The price for a decent size glass of wine is upwards of $14+. We can go to Salt Creek and get an entire bottle of higher end wine on Monday night for $20, and on Wednesdays, 1/2 off per glass of wine...without all the rug rats screaming in the room.

As for the food, I am not the biggest fan of their pizza, but it does the trick.  I tried out their crispy thin crust option for the first time, and was glad I did.  I found it to be much better than their regular styled pizzas, and will likely repeat the order the next time I come in.  Someone in our party brought an outside cake for everyone to share, so I was not able to confirm that their red velvet cake is still heavenly.  Assuming it is still the same brand/recipe as years past, then trust me when I tell you it is a must try.  Best red velvet cake I have tried on the west coast. Overall, while Kristin and their red velvet cake are 5 stars, the pizza is just not good enough for me to crave.  Given a choice, there are more than a few other local spots I would prefer for pizza.  Their pizza is not bad, but it isn't the best out there.  This is more due to personal taste as opposed to anything they are doing wrong, so I would still recommend you give them a shot if you haven't already.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=60,2.8,3.0,3.0,3.8200000000000003,2.9200000000000004

54,Eve B.,"Newhall, CA",1208,136,16.0,4.0,2015-06-06,"California Pizza Kitchen - Reboot! Kind of excited...the restaurant I grew up with, California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) has had a remodel...well...not exactly just a remodel. Met by Susan Halstead, the General Manager of our local Valencia CPK, the first thing she told me was that people that now walk in the door don't recognize that they're in a CPK if they haven't been to the Valencia location in the last two months. Susan turned me over to Cole Brocato, bartender and trainer, who has been here at our local CPK for 9 years. Cole said that they were focusing more on California inspired fare and less on pizza alone. Fresh ingredients, like California fruits and vegetables, are now more emphasized. Full Cocktail Program In providing ""unique spirited cocktails"" we had to try the Blueberry Ginger Smash - refreshing, tangy, reminded me of a whiskey Buck plus fruit - and the California Roots  avocado colors the drink, while mint and agave sour takes center stage in this unique cocktail.  The California Crush reminded Cole of traditional Valencia flavors, and we enjoyed the citrus and mint flavors that made me think of a white wine Sangria - only better. Our teen had the Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler - a nice virgin drink that was both sweet and light. These cocktails are new at CPK Valencia and are only available in the remodeled stores. Cole said that eventually all of the restaurants will be re-done. And you can get all the classic cocktails, just like the BBQ chicken pizza, too. The cocktail recipes, Cole said, are unique to CPK. Yes, they can make a Lemon Drop but they can also make a cocktail with Domaine de Canton Ginger liqueur or St. Germain Elderflower. Cole said, ""Local citrus in cocktails, California wines; we make it fresh, trendy, and organic when we can."" Taste the Unique With the new rollout, and as they have locations all over U.S., they ""want visitors to be wowed on what California Pizza Kitchen is about."" Don't be concerned that the pizzas are now listed on a long ""side bar"" of the menu, your favorites, like BBQ Chicken, Thai Chicken, Hawaiian, etc., are still there. But you will also find, under ""seasonally inspired"" menu items, a Maine Lobster Flatbread (cool lobster, loved the dill, great with the California Roots cocktail) Roasted Garlic Chicken (super mist and flavorful) with Seasonal Vegetables, Ribeye (Another moist and ""never frozen"" with great marbling to give great flavor, liked the peppery spice and butter topped on this one, and Pinot Noir salt), California Fields Salad and Tricolore Salad Pizza. Under ""main plates"" - this is the ""middle section and where it's really at"" Cole said - the ""Halibut is never farmed, always line caught, cooked on a cedar plank and that keeps it moist."" And it WAS! Delicious, great medley of spices, definitely would order again. And though we were stuffed, Ed couldn't resist having one more bite before we wrapped up our leftovers. Lunch Duos on the menu are geared to foodies that want quality and watch how much they are eating. Small Cravers fit that bill too, and have more a gastro pub like items. All the cheese, goat and cow, is pasteurized, Cole added. Originally guests had several menus, now it's all in one plus a beverage menu, which is more standard. ""You're a pizza place, why do you have this steak on the menu?"" Cole says people sometimes ask and he tells them to go ahead, ""have the steak"", and then they get it. Final Touches We sampled the seasonal-only-always-sells-out Strawberry Shortcake made with sweet biscuit, with a surprise touch of candied lemon zest glaze sprinkled over homemade whipped cream. The decadently rich Butter Cake is made with a sliver of cheesecake, warm and covered in ice cream and whipped cream; something Cole says people skip appetizers to save room for. The S'mores dessert is served with a jumbo graham, dark chocolate chunks, milk chocolate pudding and torched marshmallows - a sticky gooey all-consuming delightful mess. Some of the restaurants build the bar around the kitchen as a showcase. We did enjoy sitting at the bar, it was definitely the center of the action. All menus have different pizzas pictured on the cover, and according to Cole, the servers try to hand guests at the same table different ones - nice touch! Cole added that they hire their staff based on them being the right person and not on having to have the two years of service experience. Our teen thought that was great. Finally, when we glanced around the room completely sated and packed up leftovers we noticed both managers serving guests, people looking happy, and maybe some room for more.

Not only was I impressed with the food presentation, sandwiches, salads and dessert, but I really want to focus on the customer service I received by this gem in the community Sean. Sean works the take-out counter (I think) and worked with me from beginning to end. He took my call yesterday and was professional and patient as I expressed my concern based on past experiences with other restaurants in the community. I bring lunch in for my executives often (at least twice a week) and feeding them is part of my job that I take personally. If the food or order is wrong, then it looks bad on me. Over and over again, I can not tell you how many times either something is missing (see my other reviews) or something is wrong. Not in this case... Sean walked me through the order and PERSONALLY guaranteed the order would be correct and incredible. It was. When I arrived, Sean greeted me at the door and put his hand out to shake my hand. For a 22 year old, this is IMPRESSIVE. He walked me to the take out counter and began to show me the food... some of it he noted that he prepared himself. He carefully bagged my items, making sure that I was clear on everything he labeled, and everything he promised... all along with the biggest smile on his face.  I drove away literally feeling like I had just experienced something special. What a joy I had in my heart (drama I know but I'm serious) I had knowing that SOMEWHERE, the idea of excellent service still exists, even in the mind of a millennial... no offence. But THAT'S rare! I have already reached out to the corporation via their ""contact us"" option on the website to let them know that THIS KID DESERVES A PROMOTION! Whatever he is going to do in life, he is going to be great at it. He's just one of those kids.  I will go back, again and again, as long as I keep getting this kind of service with this kind of food. Oh, and if you are thinking about using them for corporate catering... get the large sandwich combo with the two salads and the dessert platter. It's amazing and totally worth the low price!

I ordered a Blue Moon, it was delivered cold, nice and tall.  Price was a decent price for a restaurant.  My wife ordered a Harvest Sangria, it had basil in it, elderflower juice, a bit of rum, and some white wine, and a couple grapes. Served in a St Germaine glass that I now have to hunt down.  It was very nice. My wife had the Chicken Milanese.  She felt the chicken wasn't that great and was a bit greasy.  I tried it.  I felt that while it was a tad greasy and could have used some crunch, it was good and the sauce on top (tomatoes etc.) was VERY good. I had the mushroom pizza.  Both my wife and I agreed that it was actually one of the better tasting pizza's we had ever had. We had the butter cake.  While my wife and I have a ""favorite"" in California, this one was actually very good and worth coming there to get it alone.  Order it with ice cream. The server was personable, attentive, professional, and friendly. My wife had another harvest Sangria, because she really enjoyed the first one quite a bit.  She rarely ever gets a second drink, so that's a good drink.

They either stepped up their game...or maybe we are simply learning how to order better dishes. We always start off with the yummy cocktails and avocado egg roll appetizers. The egg rolls are a hit with any age group and although sometimes they overfry it and make it too greasy, it's still almost always really tasty. I mean, avocado and bacon with chicken...what's not to love? We then ordered the sicilian pizza, veggie pizza, garlic cream fettucine, and the pesto creme penne pasta. I didn't try the veggie pizza because I need my meat but everything was so delicious, and the pesto creme penne became my new favorite.

The staff that was on point has all been replaced with lazy inept people who just figure that they will get the tip anyway. Our last ten visits have left us more and more disappointed. It's sad when you see a place like this decline so strongly. We used to come every week religiously and now it's maybe every other. They are extremely inconsistent. Sometimes if I order a full salad I get a half. They tell me it's a full but seriously we come all the time. It's annoying when you know you're being cheated. I enjoy their food and if I order a pizza it's usually dead on. Unfortunately I also like their salads.  The bread thing mentioned by others is accurate. We now usually get the bread around the end of the meal because apparently they have to wait for the yeast to rise. It's always ""in the oven and will be right out""    Seriously it's bread. They need to train the staff because they just stand around in the kitchen or at the empty bread section. God forbid you want a refill. And even when you mention it they just have the oh well attitude. I've been eating at Cpk in general for over a decade and it's hard to stay loyal here. I may just move to wolf creek where the manager moved to because he was awesome and so was the service under his watch.  This manager is too nice he would rather do the work of twenty instead of delegating it to the staff. The staff is changing too frequently so they don't seem to get the hang of it and god is it SLOW!!! I shouldn't be there for over an hour unless I choose to be!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=60,2.84,3.57,3.57,2.8280000000000003,3.278

We were seated at a table that wasn't wiped down and had no silverware, napkins, or plates. Took 15 minutes just to get our nonalcoholic drinks. No water.  We asked to have our salad before the pizza; instead we got pizza first. It was a margarita pizza - half the pizza had nothing on it and it was burned on the bottom. When the salad finally came, it had the wrong cheese in it, the chicken tasted weeks old, and the lettuces tasted like dirt. Nasty! Had to ask for napkins/silverware/plates - really? Manager tried to make things right by getting another pizza, but it was just as bad as the first one - actually burned worse.  Meanwhile the ""cooks"" were yukking it up and not paying any attention to their tasks at hand.  This place needs one of those ""restaurant rescues."" It was awful.

So, yea what everyone is saying about the wait time is here is sadly true. We go seated right away. We're told our server will be right with us and when she passed by our table she acknowledged us and did say she'll be with us in a few. It prob took more than 5 minutes for our poor waitress to get to our table. I would say the resto was more than 1/2 full but it seems that they're short staff. I took advantage of my free small plate rewards and got a corn guac with chips, it was pretty good. Our main dishes took really long, like more than 15 minutes long. The hub truly enjoyed his chipotle pizza, i had some and it was not bad, it's not your typically greasy pizza so, yea that was good. I got the zucchini shrimp pasta and it wasn't that bad, it could be improved but I guess it's like asking for more calories :) We ordered a citrus cooler with strawberries and it was refreshingly good, I'd order that again.  The waiting game continued again with the check and they forgot to remove our chips and guac but the waitress took care of it after apologizing. Overall, the staff is great, they're just overwhelmed.  We've been to this location a few times the past 2 years so I won't say I wouldn't care for CPK, but I just wish they can improve on this waiting game.

148,Smirk F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1.0,1.0,2017-02-16,"We've ordered takeout here a LOT LESS recently because for some reason, they can never get my order correctly. Not once, not twice, but on too many ocassions. This used to be our go-to place since it is very convenient when you have 2 tired and hungry kids who just want to get home and eat their food after an exhausting day.  I've also spoken to the manager a couple of times because it is just unacceptable when your staff can not fulfill a request (i.e., extra cheese on the side because your kids do  ot like their mac n cheese dry!) and you are paying the same amount of money as you would've elsewhere with better food.  So this past Valentines Day, my kids requested CPK and as much as I was hesitant to give in, I decided to give them another try since it is LOVE day and I'm sure they would do everything to make their customers happy that day. Hmmm...let's just say...I was wrong, unfortunately. Their pastas (I ordered 2 kinds) were VERY DRY and they did not even put sauce on it, but instead put it on the side! I asked for EXTRA sauce on the side for a reason! I didnt get ANY bread nor utensils (I did ask for them during the phone order). My kids didnt even enjoy their mac n cheese that even the leftovers were neglected and thrown away the next day! What a waste of my money! I realize I could've made another call to the manager, but I think that a phone call or two to let them know that there's room for improvement should've already sufficed. I'm just not one who would call to complain, esp when I'm ordering takeout so I can spend more quality time with my family and less in the kitchen! Needless to say, we will not be ordering from this place for years to come...unless ALL restaurants here in SCV are closed and they are the only ones open.  It's too bad this location can't get their stuff right. We love CPK! Just not THIS location.

The reason for the 3/5 for this particular location is that the pepperoni pizza, which is really a flagship of the chain, just honestly wasn't that good.  The experience was a perfect 5/5. The service, again, 5/5. Our server was awesome. Unfortunately I forget his name as it was a few weeks ago. Aaron? Chase? David? I think it was 1-2 syllables. Sorry, I'm a jerk.  Anyway, I think CPK does a bang-up job of hiring and training because it's always an enjoyable social experience. I actually had a CPK gift card that I've been carrying around in my wallet for a number of years and conveniently had an opportunity to use it, so we went a little crazy and ordered some appetizers of pita and hummus and chicken dumplings. The dumplings were great. Probably the best part of the meal, which was a problem because the pizza should have been the showcase here.  It just felt like the thing could have used an extra minute or two of cooking time to solidify all the cheese in the center of the pie. Unfortunately, that is kind of a personal pet peeve of mine when pizzas are runny in the center. I know the restaurant is busy on a Saturday night but this is THE Pizza Kitchen, man!

Waited 5 more minutes before someone came out, not caring that I had sat there for 30 minutes and was concerned about the freshness and it being cold. He said it had been under warmers for the past 30 minutes! OMFG! So by the time I had got home the cheese was re-coagulated and stiff!  Called 8/26 to speak to a manager about the $35 charge on my credit card for two cheese pizzas and they transferred me to a hostes! Not a flipping manager!  I am so done with this restaurant! The pizza from there tastes just like the crap you get from the freezer aisle of the grocery store!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia,3.36,3.22,3.22,,3.2760000000000007

The place is very clean and modern looking, but other than that I wasn't impressed.  When I entered the place I was greeted with a curt ""How Many?!"" instead of a ""Welcome to CPK"", ""Hello"",""Good Afternoon"" or even a smile.   The staff are much more interested in talking with each other than paying attention to the customers.  Plus, when my pizza came it was supposed to be a sausage, pepperoni & mushroom.  It had lots of mushrooms, but 3 pepperonis and 2 (yes 2) pieces of sausage.    I've been here three separate times and was treated with the same disdain each time.  Time to go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia,3.24,3.2,3.2,,3.2160000000000006

13,Marie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,13,,2.0,2017-09-01,"I placed in an order for delivery to our office today, and was hoping to have a nice Friday catered meal for the team. When we first started the order online, it prompted us with about 19 minutes of a wait time - no big deal. But as people started entering their orders, the time time increased all the way up to a 70 minute wait time - so we hurried up and placed the order!  So, the time for our food delivery comes, and passes, but no food. One of the employees called me and apologizes, saying somehow our order (which we paid extra for delivery) was entered into the system as pick up, and it's been sitting out, waiting for pick up for *over an hour*. She said she's going to remake the food for us and have it delivered, but we'll be waiting even longer now. Why wouldn't they have called us earlier if the food was sitting out for over an hour without a pick up? I get errors happen, but, we're hangry. And now you get this hangry review. I left 2 stars because at least I like the food but this is a little ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia,3.24,3.19,3.19,,3.21
25,David S.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",5,20,4.0,2.0,2017-09-09,"I have no problem with the place or the food.  My issue is with the one particular bartender who I've watched furiously scratch his beard, run his hands through his hair, and scratch his nose -- and then make a drink or plate food. This happens every time we see him there.  We've complained to the manager and general manager (she stood next to him once while he scratched for like 30 seconds). Don't know if they've talked to him, but he's still there scratch and rubbing before he makes your drink or plates your food. Bon Appétit! Update: CPK corporate reached out and asked me to submit a ticket via their support site. I did and the store general manager called me directly.  She explained that the employee had been retrained and asked to resign a hygiene policy.  Very responsive company, which is great.  My concern is that the manager told me she couldn't do much more, as she hasn't seen the employee violate the policy.  I understand this, but per my above comments, I watched him scratch for 30 seconds while she stood right next to him. In the end, the response is a bit of a ""we've done what we can, sorry"", so I'll just choose not to eat at this location anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia?start=20,3.28,3.16,3.16,,3.2080000000000006

We left the location and decided to eat else where.  Came in on Wednesday. The wait was 15 minutes again. Several tables open, however the waiting area was packed.

Our server never offered refills for our drinks, nor asked if we wanted anything else and instead just brought the check when he assumed we were done with our meal. I don't know but waiters should have personality and be more mindful of the dining experience they are creating. Because even if the food is great; if the service isn't then that ruins your meal. It did for me on this day, came to celebrate a birthday and instead of being offered dessert, I was given the check before I was even done with my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-valencia,3.12,3.13,3.13,,3.126

I was also underwhelmed with the architecture; the CPK in Burbank is far more charming. The space here in Valencia felt like a big rectangular box. I ordered split pea soup (our server volunteered that this  only vegan option for soup, not that I cared because I'm not vegan - but it was very good and included barley and carrots in the recipe) and the spinach salad that included apples, pecans, and quinoa. Both were exceptionally good, as was the passion fruit mango iced tea. Honestly though, $3.29 for iced tea? That's a bit outrageous.  The service was very good and the staff was attentive without being annoying.

After picking food up to go and driving home, we were appalled to find  chicken scraps on the salad...after digging through the pieces of lettuce thinking the chicken could be hidden, we found nothing! So, bringing out my trusted food scale, we gathered the few pieces to find that we were given a whopping 1.8 ounces of BBQ chicken on our $15 salad. Not to mention the avocado we added was less than a quarter of California's glorious creamy avocado. Calling the assistant gm at first was not wanting to refund the card saying we had to go in to refund it. He eventually said he would cancel and refund the whole meal, since we had two orders of pot stickers on there. I get you guys are corporate and have ounces to save.
