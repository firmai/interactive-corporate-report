529,Melissa A.,"Corona, CA",10,10,,5.0,2012-01-02,Love Cheesecake Factory portions are huge yes but I love that you can always split a plate & the food never disappoints. Usually service is good but I was here on New Year's Eve & well the service was sucking my waitress just disappeared to never return but a great waiter named Tim (I'm pretty sure that was it) saved our night he was so great even though they had ran out of the meatloaf I wanted to order he suggested a lot of other things.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=520,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.2520000000000002,3.7200000000000006
361,Todd R.,"Upland, CA",21,25,11.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"Bring your thinking cap and a huge appetite. Menu = HUGE It is really too much to choose from. Portions = HUGE I have yet to finish a plate of food here. They should cut the portion in half AND the price. If you compare the amount of food you get with the price, it's really not too pricey. However, you may be shocked at the prices if you are unaware of this fact. On to the food itself. It's really good!

551,Jip Z.,"Austin, TX",40,202,277.0,2.0,2012-01-17,"I decided to cash in a gift card here this past Monday and showed up around lunch time. We were seated within 15 minutes and the location of our booth was pretty good. The waitress who took our order had zero personality and didn't crack one smile the entire time she was helping us. I ordered a tropical drink that lacked any alcohol. It was such a crappy drink that my friend who also ordered one, had to request a double shot in the second one he got. I decided to stick with water. We got an appetizer of Spinach and artichoke dip which was very good although $10 for an appetizer is kind of steap in my opinion. The food runner who brought it to us was just a delight (sarcasm), she pushed it onto our table while shoving all other objects out of its way with the plate and exclaimed ""Spinach dip""... Myself and my guests just stared at eachother like ""uh, okay?"" I probably didnt need to order anything else but I got the fish taco's. They were pretty good... but the rice and beans didnt arrive until I was already finished with two of them. My friend got a burger and my son got a pizza. The childrens pizza was huge. In fact all of our food was huge and pretty good. I cant complain. It was basically the service that I disliked. Although our server was on top of us and got us everything we needed, she seemed like she was in a bad mood and we felt like we were burdoning her with our visit. I've been to several Cheesecake Factory's and I always seem to get the same crappy service. This time wasn't even the worst but it certainly sealed my opinion of the place. I'm not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=540,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.9520000000000004,3.5600000000000005
405,Tammy L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",860,819,456.0,4.0,2012-01-22,"I always liked Cheescake Factory. I've received great service and food quality here. The average price for this excellent quality of food is around $10-$15 dollars for an entree.  The desserts (the Cheesecakes, of course) are anywhere from $6 to $8.  I ordered Crusted Herb Salmon with Steak Diane (a combo plate) that cost $19.95.  They bring out a couple different types of bread before your meal that will hold you over for the 15-20 minute wait for food. Sooo what's for dessert?!  The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake of course! Some say they like it and some say it's overrated but I say who cares what anyone else says..I FREAKING LOVE IT! Can't really say much except that it's a party in my mouth.  try to avoid weekends.. they tend to get crowded!! I love all their cheesecakes.

They prises i thought were kinda high but when the waitor placed our plates in front of us, holy cow! huge portion of posta, and it turns out we had half left over for lunch for the next day. The service was terrific, the nicest and most hard working waitor i have ever had, left him a very very nice tip. And of coarse we got cheesecake for dessert  and it is by far the best i have ever tasted, the different verieties they have is mouth watering It is very hard to deside which one to get they have lots to choose from.

The restaurant for being a chain is so beautiful inside, always very clean and service is good. Lots of menu options so prepare to spend quite a bit of time looking lol.

438,Joel O.,"Riverside, CA",2,117,2.0,4.0,2012-03-17,"We had dinner here to celebrate a birthday.  The food was quite good (huge selection BTW) and service was too for the most part.  We ended up having two servers share our table.  The first appeared to be a little overwhelmed with the evening.  It was a very busy Friday night.  The second, Jairo, (I think) was outstanding.  He kept our glasses full and made sure empty plates were immediately removed from the table. The bread was a great appetizer and the food arrived fairly quickly.  Everyone was please with their meal and many had to take home leftovers as the portions were generous.  The prices were reasonable for dinner at about $25 per person with drink, tax, and tip included. As with any large chain restaurant, we had a dirty water glass and a dirty spoon at one place setting.  No big deal, but worthy of comment.  The noise level was fine and we were able to enjoy conversation at the table with everyone present.   Oh, one thing.  The tiny little double-shot-glass sized birthday sundae they serve when you have someone with a birthday is not complimentary. It will cost you an additional $2.95 plus tax, so be prepared to see that on the bill.  The servers were great and happily sang Happy Birthday for the guest of honor.   I was surprised to find there is no wi-fi at this location.  Management, if you read this, I would suggest adding complimentary wi-fi as nearly everyone has a smartphone these days and it is nice to have free internet access, especially while waiting to be seated.

When I came to tell her that my beeper hasent gone off,she gave me a bitchy attitude. The food that day wasn't soo tasty the server came by once in awhile too check on us,she seemed out of it too.

506,Cher W.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,174,7.0,4.0,2012-04-10,I love all my Cheesecake Factories... and this one is no exception.  Chain restaurant with a LARGE variety on the menu. Hardest part is choosing what you want to eat. I typically get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and I can guarantee that the portion is large you won't be able to finish it.  Cheesecake is always a must. Noms for the tuxedo!  My complaint is the expensive alchy drinks.

396,Chris T.,"Riverside, CA",65,124,360.0,4.0,2012-04-12,"I came on a lunch break for a quick meal. It was a Saturday around 3:30pm. I had originally wanted to come in for their Happy Hour, but that was Monday through Friday only. =( So I settled ordering from their small plates menu and sat at the bar so that I didn`t have to wait for a table. I wanted a light lunch, so i started with the Beets and Goat Cheese. Beets, goat cheese, green apples, candied pecans, and arugula tossed in a delicious dressing. So yummy. After eating that, I was still hungry, so I ordered the Mini Corn Dogs. I love hot dogs, so crispy deep fried battered small hot dogs with ketchup and mustard is something I can`t say no to. So as I`m sitting, I constantly see cheesecakes walk past me. No kidding, it`s The Cheesecake Factory. The bartender hands me a menu and asks me if I wanted to get dessert. I thought about it and ended up getting the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake. So much for my light lunch. Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake, my new favorite! I`ve always stuck to the Original with Strawberries, but the Dulce de Leche hit a whole new spot! Caramel cheesecake, caramel mousse, vanilla crust, with crunchy candied walnuts and mountains of whipped cream.

561,Able A.,"Corona, CA",4,181,1.0,1.0,2012-04-18,"Last week, my family and I were hungry at about 10 pm and most restaurants closed near Tyler Street in Riverside except this restaurant. After we sat down, we waited 16 minutes for the waitress to take our orders and 55 minutes for the food. The waitress never came back with water or acknowledgment how long we needed to wait for our food! We brought it to the manager's attention with our professional comments. I asked for his name, which he refused. Not only that he did not value our business, he also has a sharp tongue barking at me like a mad dog shouting, ""It takes 15 minutes to take 2 orders, 40-45 minutes to cook a spaghetti with meat sauce. I will not compensate you. Your complaint is unnecessary. I came from England and also have an accent like you. Pay your bill and leave now, or I will call the security."" He ordered his waiter to call the security while he used his middle finger to signal me to pay and leave. I was embarrassed in front of other customers by this man, who was bold enough to discriminate, threaten and intimidate me with his physical size twice of mine. Not only the food was cold, tasteless, hardly any meat in the sauce, 99% is pasta with no value for the price; the manager also created a hostile environment for dining. He is anti-customers for making complaints. We rather go hungry than eat at this outrageous place, not even for free.

310,Amaya S.,"Redlands, CA",787,486,855.0,3.0,2012-06-25,"3 1/2 Stars. In the grand scheme of things I'm really happy there is a Cheesecake Factory so close to home.  And with it being located at Tyler I tend to come here and eat, go in the mall and shop, then go to AMC and remember they are way to damn high and go home.  Seriously I walk up those stairs and get pissed every time...... when will I learn. As we all know the parking is ridiculous.  Not that there isn't enough space, because their is. But, with it being so close to the malls entrance there is always congestion.  But you'll live. As with any CF its beautiful. But, I have the same problem here as with every other location 1. Why is the floor so damn slippery? 2. The front entrance is a waste of space. Maybe you could reduce the under-equipped sitting area and put more tables so we can sit sooner. I have had a lot of meals at CF, all over So Cal and Vegas, but here is where I had a life altering meal.  I'm a big Burger fan so I came here for a gourmet Burger.  I settled for the Macaroni and Cheese Burger.  The skinny angel on my shoulder got beat up by the fat devil obviously.  There I am trying to rationalize my decision, and it comes out.  And what did I say? ""Oh my God, what have I done"". Not a good sign.  Not at all. The Burger (in all its glory) had a delicious bun, medium rare patty, FRIED mac and cheese ball with cheese sauce and typical Burger condiments.  I ate the WHOLE Burger.  It was THAT good.  And I almost started crying.  I couldn't believe I ordered it to begin with, AND ate it all.  I was so depressed I couldn't shop..... so I went home.  I've never experienced that before. It was totally worth it, although Ill never eat it again.

We were seated at a booth, which for me I do not like. However this booth was comfortable and didn't seem to bother me at all. My friend and her nephew accompanied me here, as it was a payback for a bet won ;).  I opted for the Gumbo. I haven't had really good Gumbo since I moved away from the South. This was so full of flavor, so bold I felt like I had stepped back in time. Or maybe it was simply that I was hungry, haha. I forgot my phone in the car so I didn't get a picture.  The portions were very large, so you knew you weren't walking away hungry. The amount of sausage to shrimp to veggies was equal in proportion to the serving.  Nice amount of brown rice in the center, yummy.  I was able to eat all but a few bites.  My friend ordered butter garlic pasta of some sort for the little one. When it came to the table it looked dry. The server was very attentive and quick to right the wrong. She was also very attentive throughout the meal.  For dessert I had the red velvet cheese cake. Yummy yummy. Mouth watering and filling. Light. I enjoyed the decor within the place as well. I really enjoy art, so looking at the murals and such on the ceiling was relaxing in its own. The lighting wasn't too bright, nor too dim.  I had never ventured into a Cheesecake Factory before, because that is what I thought it was, simply about cakes. Had I known otherwise long ago, maybe I would have had this experience before. Who knows. All in God's time :).  I'll definitely return to The Cheesecake.

I called to make a reservation for my Graduation dinner day before my graduation date and they told me they do not take reservations at all. They made this very clear to me on the phone.  2. The next day after I graduated, my family and I went to cheesecake factory and they handed us the beeper and told us it would be a 10 minute wait. ....we end up sitting there for 45 minutes and we go back to the host to see whats going on and the manager comes to us saying the wait will be an hour to 2 hours. .... we ask why we were told the wait was 10 minutes and they said because there were reservations made. This ticked me off because I called in advance asking about when and how I can make a reservation....I told the manager about this and he still refused to seat us even with all the open seating.

393,A J.,"San Diego, CA",2,80,25.0,5.0,2012-12-01,"Had to give this a 5 star review only because it would not be at the top where it would be read because yelp caters to these businesses. On Nov, 23 I was at the CF arriving about 2pm and I purchased $400 of their gift certificates. I had to wait for a table. Yeah, who would think that at that hour there would be anyone eating. I got there intentionally at that hour to avoid the lunch crowd. There were 8 of us in our party. Four of us were there and we ordered two appetizers waiting patiently for the appetizers which didn't show up for a good 25 min, by then my other 4 guests were seated. I hadn't planned on the appetizers taking so long to arrive so that meant that I had to share them with the rest in the group, we barely got an avocado egg roll and some humus.  The waiter Tony J. was not a good waiter nor did he care because if there are 6 or more in your party CF WILL automatically include a 18% gratuity charge on the bill as well as wait for you to give them an additional ""bonus tip."" They won't tell you that when you sit down because they expect you to dig it out from the fine print (per the manager) nor will the waiter tell you up front. My salmon did not taste right and Tony never returned to ask if there was anything wrong or if we needed something like refills. WOW, so after he put the bill on the table and ran, he never mentioned that he had made two charges (one for the food & drinks) and the other for the tip. I asked him why we were charged for an extra drink and he looked around to count then said he would fix it. He came back and I figured he had fixed it. However, today 12/1, after looking at my mother's picture that he took of our group I see that he still had a drink that he overcharged on the bill.  CHECK YOUR BILL carefully especially if it is larger party. I called the manager, Mike, who interrogated me and was more intent as to why I didn't address this in front of my guests AT the time we were there rather than to deal with this situation afterward. I told Mike the service was bad and that by Tony deducting the $22.25 tip from my gift certificates that I had no way to dispute this had it been a credit card. That Tony never mentioned that one was a separate bill for the tip. Mike said he would roll the video tape back (yeah, do you think so?) to see how long it took Tony to get the appetizers to the table and see his lack of service. This gets so old at the CF when a person comes in for the food and has to deal with poor service and  being overcharged on top of that. Don't think that they will believe you even if you have a complaint. CF doesn't care because if you don't go to eat there someone else will. This restaurant has had so many problems with service and wait times that have been brought up by many people (see other comments below) but nothing has been done to resolve this. Apparently, CF doesn't care otherwise they would have fixed these problems. Personally, I don't think a party of 6 is large since my family is a party of 5 kids and 2 parents.  If they feel a need to force a gratuity charge then it should be for a group of MORE than eight and it really shouldn't be forced! This only means that they want to be sure they get extra money for doing less work. IF they feel that their service is so good then their guests would leave the appropriate tip that was deserved by the waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=380,3.32,3.59,3.59,3.2840000000000003,3.482

Our waitress, Deanna, was right with us to take our drink orders and bring us bread.  She came right back when we told her we were ready to order.  We ended up ordering two appetizers/snack plates - the crab bites and the fried cheese.  Both were brought quickly, and both were delicious!  Our appetizer (we split) - the farfalle with bacon, peas, mushrooms in a cream sauce - came quickly and was piping hot.  We both thought it was delicious. We asked Deanna to bring boxes for our leftovers, which she did promptly.  She boxed our food then took our cheesecake order.  My husband ordered the Adams (a family favorite), and I tried the Oreo.  Both were fantastic.  I'm looking forward to eating the remnants of mine later today! Two notes I would like to make:  1) The bathroom was pretty messy, but I assume that is because the restaurant was so busy no-one had had time to service it recently.  2) Several servers came to our table with food that wasn't ours, and took our food to the table beside us before realizing it was ours.  I'm not sure if they number tables or what but they could work on that a bit so that there is minimal confusion when the restaurant is crowded.  It wasn't a big deal, just a note. Overall, our food was delicious and our waitress, Deanna was great.  She was friendly, quick, and helpful.  I have always liked the Cheesecake Factory and I'm sure we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=380,3.2,3.57,3.57,3.184,3.422

Their ""SkinnyLicious"" menu, comes with similar choices as their main menu, but all meals are less than 600 calories.  I ate their Fettuccini Alfredo, and it was delightful. It had a rich, creamy parmesan sauce, and it was completed with sliced, tender chicken, scattered on top. My wife took the SkinnyLicious Grilled Turkey Burger, and it came in a small portion, and she said it was very tasty. For dessert, we shared the OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake. It was marvelous!

First, we had to wait for chair for 35 minutes. This wasn't the worst and the wait was fine, Macy's is just nearby so you could kill time there. After we were seated, it took them more than 10 minutes to get back to our table and get our orders. This pissed me out, because it felt like a waste of time. Our food should be cooking by now, you know what I mean? The wait for food was about 10 minutes too or more, but this is understandable.  We asked for honey wheat bread, server said hold on a second. We were forgotten. Server came back in more than ten minutes, said, ""you wanted more brown bread, right?"", takes off with our basket and comes back in less than a minute. What the? If it's that easy to get us bread, why make us wait that long?  I just found it ridiculous. Anyway, I ordered something different. I always have the Cajun jambalaya pasta, now I tried the Da Vinci pasta. It seemed well loved on yelp. Fail! My pasta was way too salty it made my lips feel funny.

Cheesecake is located next to Macy's of the Galleria Mall; it's not attached but literally next to Macy's. 3 stop intersection is a high traffic area so I recommend turning into the first right turn possible should you enter the mall from Tyler St. We came a little after 7 and parking wasn't bad but there were a lot and I mean A LOT of groups waiting to dine. We'd resigned ourselves to having to wait a while when the mgr said we could be seated right away if we didn't mind dining in the outside patio area. Mind you, it was high 90° weather today but the sun had already begun to set so it was nice to dine al fresco. Our server for the evening was Kevin and he really did his best to give us great service. He had a lot of tables to cover and he was running his butt off so kudos to him. Because you could see how hard he was working, it was ok that there was a wait for our orders to be taken and our drinks to be refilled - he was quick to get our drink orders, appetizer orders and place bread baskets at our table. Service throughout the whole meal was good from him and other servers delivering the food, especially on such a busy night.  The food, hit and miss: Appetizers: Ahi tuna carpaccio and crispy crab wontons. Carpaccio a hit with thinly sliced ahi tuna arranged nicely on a plate, drizzled with an avocado/ wasabi dressing. There was also half of a sliced avocado, pickled cucumbers, pickled ginger, and a ponzu dipping sauce for accompaniments. The wontons were way too heavy with the imitation crab flavor and it overpowered all the other ingredients in the filling. The wontons had a nice crunch and came with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Entrées: Spaghetti carbonara with chicken. Leave the chicken out. It was dry and bland, tasted like it was thrown in as an after thought. Rest of it was great though. Spaghetti was al dente and the sauce was creamy and rich but not overpowering at all. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - If you like a strong lemony flavor, this is your dish. The sauce was very strong on the pesto and lemon, the flavors seemed to compete more than compliment and the shrimp just got lost in the battle. Wasabi crusted ahi tuna- This dish was the biggest disappointment of the night. Reading the description, you think it's going to be a nice thin crispy crust all around the tuna. What came out was a tuna with a thick green paste slathered over the surface and the paste had a grainy consistency and was as thick as the tuna. The fish tasted fine once you took off the paste and the veggies were nicely cooked. Well received entrées were the filet and rib eye (can't really go wrong cooking a steak), and the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. Dessert: You can never go wrong with their cheesecakes and we ordered the Pineapple Upside down and Oreo, so good with the former being my personal fave. I remember having better quality food here and only stayed away because the calorie count on their dishes are usually in 1000+ range. They have a skinnylicious menu now with offerings under 600 calories. I'll probably come back and give it a try sometime. Perhaps the quality of food was off due to high volume traffic.

Because I've been trying to eat clean lately, our obvious pick had to be Cheesecake Factory.  Ha! For those that been to a Cheesecake Factory before, the menu hasn't changed much, and because we came during lunch, there also wasn't much of a line. Actually none at all.  Service was good as usually and we had a very attentive server. She gave us recommendations that fit our needs. I opted for something off their Skinnylicious menu, which is their version of a lite menu.  The Skinnylicious menu consist of smaller servings, lower fat, lower calorie, and higher protein meals.  What I found funny was that the lowest calorie meal was between 440-490 calories.  Isn't that high, especially if you're eating between 6-8 meals per day?  It's all relative and I ended up with just a cup of brown rice, broccoli, and salmon (no seasoning).  Meal was fairly tasty, but not much was expected since I had it plain. At least my fish was flaky.

However we arrived and given the amount of our party of 10 and it being a Friday night we greeted the bday girl and most of the party outside.  My husband and I decided to go to the bar and have a drink.  Of course not without asking the birthday girl if we could get her something, water, soda or tea? She asked for a sprite and my husband and I went inside and sat at the bar.  A young lady by the same of Summer was the main bartender serving.  We placed our drink order an asked if we could take the soda outside.  She replied yes but meant the outside of the bar which is the inside waiting area.  We sat there and had a few drinks when some of our other party arrived and joined us at the bar.  We ordered their drinks and then thought, ""instead of letting the sprite sit at the bar and melt"" we asked the bartender for a plastic cup.  She rudely placed the empty plastic cup in front of my husband.  Being a bit disappointed that she placed it there and walked away rudely he asked if she could pour the sprite for him?   She turned and said she will get to it when she can!  She then went back to making drinks and being that it is a busy night she was just short and cold.  Once she did come to pour the soda she slammed the glass the soda was in on the bar and walked away rudely again! My husband then asked if she was always this rude and what the big deal was to smile as she's working.  She then fired back and stated ""she is just too busy and doesn't think asking her to pour the soda was necessary ! At that point I was like wow this lady has problems! I am a very passive person and my husband may have been out of line by asking her about being rude but she was! She then proceeded to carry on an arguement  in order to validate her reason for being upset and it all came back to her being way tooooooo busy.  Really, did she only expect to have two people walk into a Cheesecake Factory, on a Friday night, in a mall shopping center?!?!?  Her serving the bar and possibly the entire restaurant I expect some rush or shortness but to stand there and full on argue with a customer is so appalling!  I then told her I understand your busy but you should still be polite and the reason I say this cuz I have bartender before! She then yelled back"" ya ya ya, I have been doing this for 6 yrs!  At this point I can see she was pointless to talk to so I asked that I speak to the manager. He came over was polite , apologized on her behalf and we told him we are not looking to get anything free but that he simply needed to have a talk to her.  I went through what just happened with her and that we were here with a huge party celebrating a birthday.  He did end up comping our drinks. However the bartender then decided to crack jokes in front of us with the people sitting next to us, so my husband asked if he could have another beer ""if she wasn't to busy"" she then got. upset and said we need to drop it already!  I was like really because you were just cracking sarcastic remarks towards us with the people next to us.  She then started to raise her voice again in front of the manager this time.   The manager again apologized and said she has been going through some personal issues.  I highly recommend they get her help or some time off because that is not how you treat hardworking locals that are going to spend our hardworking money!  We then got our table called thanks to the manager wanting to make the situation better.   However from that point on it was just awkward! Had it not been due to the busy Friday night wait and the birthday girl wanting to eat there we would have easily walked out at this point. However we didn't and we stayed.  We waited 20 mins before we had to ask the servers if we would be getting any bread baskets?  They then took about another 10mins to bring it out.  Our drinks took forever.  The waitress went around the table and took orders and as she went to the person on my left I told her me and my husband were on one bill and she stated she would note that and will take the order the way she is, due to knowing who ordered what. When we asked for the checks she made it a point to call me out and let it be known that I'm the young lady that is with my husband.  She still screwed up the bill twice!

My family usually doesn't go to the Cheesecake Factory just because the prices are so expensive for mediocre food, however, we decided to go there tonight since it's close and sounded appetizing at the time.  We got there around 9:30..didn't wait too long for our seats, and our waiter, Nick, came by immediately to greet and serve us. Nick was a great waiter..he was funny, friendly, and was constantly attending to our needs. So the service at the restaurant, for the most part, was great.  We then ordered our food. All four of us got chicken dishes, mine specifically was the tomato basil pasta. It took about 20 minutes for all of our food to arrive, which I thought was a pretty long time, however, I didn't let it bother me. So the food gets to our table, and looks great. I dig right in, and find something peculiar about my pasta. It was kind of tough. I didn't want to be wrong, so I got a second, third, and fourth opinion from my two brothers and my best friend. I let the waiter know, and he willingly sent it back and gave me a complimentary salad as I waited (which I did not enjoy that much, but it was the thought that counted). Another fifteen minutes go by and I still have no food. By this time everyone at the table is done eating, so I ask for my food to go..which didn't arrive for another ten minutes. The waiter kindly told me that if the food is still not good when I got home, to call the restaurant and let them know the issue for a free gift card to the restaurant. I said thank you, but didn't think that I would need to complain anymore.  So we get home, and even though I'm not hungry at this point, I taste my food to make sure that it was cooked properly. Sadly, it wasn't. The pasta was still very dry and tough. I call back the restaurant, and get put on the phone with the manager. I let him know the situation, and he tries to explain to me how pasta is supposed to be cooked, and that's how it's done in Italy. That kind of ticked me off, because he made me seem like I don't know how pasta is supposed to be cooked. I, as well as my brothers, know quite well what 'al dente' is because it's not the first time we had pasta. 'Al dente,' yes, is not supposed to be soft and break apart, but that doesn't mean it should be rubbery and have crunchy parts in it. Now, I'm not one to make up complaints just for free things, but I'm assuming that's what he thought I was after. Anyway, he ended up sending me a fre gift card to repay for my meal, which was very curteous.  Overall, I was satisfied with the service of the Cheesecake Factory staff, but I don't think I will go there again if it's not for dessert.

Just as expected, the service was prompt, and the food was great. Everything was going well...until I approached the dessert bar to order a slice of cheesecake to go.  After I selected my cheesecake & paid the cashier, I watched in horror as the young lady working behind the counter grabbed my dessert with her bare hands & set it inside of a plastic container. Still in shock, I asked the cashier if it was a standard practice for their employees to wear gloves when handling the desserts. He quickly replied, ""No, we wash our hands."" Although I do not doubt that the employees wash their hands frequently, I still found it a bit unsanitary and ultimately canceled my order.  It's never pleasant to see a complete stranger paw your food with bare hands...no matter how clean they may be.

Though it was really deep fried. BUT my nachos were a disgrace. If I wanted to order nachos that have been microwaved. I woulda just made them at home. The chips were stale. You can tell that all they did was sprinkle cheese on it and microwaved it. Not to mention it wasn't even warm. They served it cold. WORST thing I have ever gotten. I don't care if I got everything for free (coupon) to serve something microwaved from such a distinguished restaurant chain is a disgrace. I seriously ate like 3-4 chips and I was done.

(very impersonal) Aside..from the bad seating section where they sit all the young people who they ASSUME aren't going to tip.  Our server, was an older lady with dark hair, was EXTREMELY pushy, and impatient. She gave us our menu, NO JOKE! came back in 30 seconds and asked us if we were ready to order...anyone who's been to this place before knows how gigantic that menu is. We politely told her we need more time. ONCE AGAIN! not less than a minute goes by, she's back with an even shorter attitude asking if we were ready to order. I was irritated right then and there, but i'm pretty patient as i know serving can be a very stressful job. We told her what we wanted, then she gave us this very pissy look... while saying ""do you want the full portion or the lunch portion?"" as if we couldn't afford it. and i almost came unglued and she could see it on my face. I said THE FULL portion please...FOR BOTH OF US. she walked away with an even poorer attitude. and made the whole time spent there quite awkward. It then dawned on me, the reason for the rushed service, was because she assumed we were coming in at the last minute for lunch specials to get a cheaper bill, and that if we didn't get the cheaper price (like some difficult customers do) we'll bitch about it and she won't get as big of big of a tip. I AM A GENEROUS TIPPER, ALWAYS. Even if the service isn't that great. BUT this is the one time i really really felt like leaving nothing. BUT NO. I'm not like her. her shitty attitude didn't keep me from being a decent person. a generous tip was left, despite being treated like two young children looking for the cheapest meal we can get.

490,Kelly B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,22,,3.0,2014-08-28,"The food was delicious. This was my first time here and I got the Renee's special with the chicken salad sandwich, salad, and baked potato soup. Some of the other people in my party got the same thing and we all agreed, the sandwich was delicious, the soup was absolutely amazing, but the salad had way too much salad dressing. Another person in our party got a burger and it was mediocre, and the onion rings were pretty greasy. The consensus was that a fast food burger and onion rings would have actually been better.  I'm knocking off two stars because of the service. We were trying to decide where to go and called while in the parking lot to see if there was a wait time, or if we could put in a reservation. They told us we couldn't put in a reservation, but that there was no wait time. We told them we were a large party of 10 and they said still, there was no wait time. We walked in the door less than 5 minutes later and were told there would be a 45 minute wait. That was extremely annoying. We were then seated after about 35 minutes and our server, though very friendly, was very slow. Some people got there food (no exaggeration here) 45 minutes before others. It took them an hour just to get the bread on the tables and many of us weren't eating until we had been seated for close to two hours. Normally I would chalk this up to us being a big party, but while that would explain why it takes a while for us to get the food, it doesn't explain why it took so long to take the orders, or even bring us straws. It was clear they weren't incredibly busy, so I'm unsure why everything took so long.  We also asked them to sing happy birthday to one of the girls in our party, and they came almost an hour after we asked, when 3 girls from the party stepped away to the bathroom, which was annoying.

One is a Garlic Cheese Bread with parmigiana/Olive Oil and Marinara Sauces.

And seeing other tables getting their food and not us, they finally bring out our food and everything was correct at our table except for mine which the server said was an Old Fashioned burger NOT protein style. I told him that's not what I ordered and that it's supposed to be protein style. He says oh yeah well let me check that and fix it for you. He proceeds to come back not 2 minutes later with the SAME dry burger sloppily thrown in a couple of lettuce leaves. I said this is still not what I ordered and he ignored me and walked away.

319,Christy M.,"Murrieta, CA",3,44,4.0,2.0,2014-09-25,So I'm not sure why I keep going back to the Cheesecake Factory (I'm pretty sure it's because the food is amazing but after today's experience I am not sure that matters anymore). I met my Mom and son here today for lunch.  When I arrived at the restaurant they were already seated and had ordered my son's lunch.  Shortly after I arrived so did his macaroni and I started to think that maybe today we would get good service!  I was sadly mistaken... My mom ordered the Asian Chicken Tacos ( from the Skinny Menu).  I ordered my usual the Luau Salad.  When our lunches arrived i requested more dressing as my salad was just a tad bit dry.  When the server brought out the dressing I took a large spoonful and added the dressing to my salad!  My mistake...I should have tasted it first to make sure it was the right dressing before pouring on my salad (I assumed that my server would bring the correct dressing).  In any case I took one bite and realized that it wasn't right (this is a sweet salad and the dressing she brought tasted like balsamic vinegar...very tangy).  It honestly took about 10 mins before our server came back to check on us at which time I told her that it was the wrong dressing.  No apology but she did offer to remake my salad.   About 15 mins later my new salad still hadn't arrived but my server walked over to the table with 2 containers of dressing and told me to sample both.  She said one was balsamic and one was a shallot vinegarette.   I tasted both and they tasted very similar (no surprise as they looked identical as well).  She then began to argue with me that she had brought the shallot vinegarette to begin with.  She kept asking which dressing I wanted on my salad!  I told her that I was frustrated because I was pretty certain that neither dressing was right!  I was looking for the sweet dressing that always comes on that salad.  Again she argued that it was the shallot dressing.  Ugh!  At this point I am not happy.  I told her to please just make the salad the way that they would normally make it and if she could please put it in a to-go box because I am not late getting back to work! About 5 mins later the Manager walked out with my salad.  I pointed to the yellowish dressing drizzled on the plate (which wasn't on the first plate) and asked him what that dressing was called.  He responded with the name (which I have now forgotten).  In any case it wasn't the Shallot dressing that the server kept arguing with me about.   Now mind you when my salad arrived at the table my mom and son (who both eat really slowly) were both done with their lunches.  I ended up having to take my salad to-go and eating at my desk.   Bottom line...the Manager was very nice (I think his name is Frank).  The server was snotty and extremely unprofessional.  I was really disappointed.   I am only updating to 2 stars because the Manager was very nice and helpful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=300,3.48,3.55,3.55,2.9200000000000004,3.5220000000000002

Unfortunately, as on previous visits, there were several issues that made for a less than cool dining experience: 1. I requested a strawberry margarita instead of a regular one and was told it would be $5 extra.  WHAT?  Never have I been to any bar where they charge more than $1 extra (if any) for strawberry.  After all, it is only 25 cents worth of strawberry puree spooned into the glass/blender.  In fact, at On the Border and Lonestar Steakhouse, that same Happy Hour Strawberry Margarita Is only $3.....SO, how in the world can Cheesecake Factory possibly justify $10 for theirs?? Something is big time wrong here, and the server never bothered to call over the manager, despite my protests. 2.  On to the food:  With 5 different items ordered, it would seem logical that the server would tell the kitchen to perhaps send 1 out every 8 minutes, which would have been ideal.  BUT, I'm sure this never happened and she failed to tell the kitchen that all 5 items were for ONE person.  SO, what happened was an eating nightmare:  My yummy artichoke came out and then 1 minute later, 3 more plates arrived, and a few minutes more an a plateful of sliders arrived as my dessert.  I waited 15 minutes for the mustard and mayo for the latter, but it never arrived.....Food was so-so, but most was COLD by the time I got around to trying it.   No discount, no comps, and no manager anywhere to be seen.  WHY?  Just a total waste of my nice $25 gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=220,3.68,3.47,3.47,2.9160000000000004,3.5540000000000003

I have always been more than happy With the service here.  I am always greeted with a warm smile and all the servers I've had been very efficient and friendly. Although their main menu is very high in the fat and calorie content, happily they have a skinny licious menu that is really amazing.  There is a chicken pasta that has fresh garlic basil and tomato and I still can't figure how it could be under 500 calories. However, if you're looking to splurge on calories, their chicken Madera is to die for! It is it chicken breast that is a grilled, the top is layered with asparagus and cheese, then topped off with a gorgeous mushroom Madera sauce. Of course to keep the calorie content even higher it is served with mashed potatoes. It is absolute joy in your mouth And you could seriously split it with three people.  Tonight I had my best experience ever so I really wanted to give kudos where kudos are deserved. Our hostess was named CHELSEA She was right out of a Disneyland ride.

Then immediately asked ""so you ready to order?""...I was in such shock with her attitude I had no words. She then dropped off stale bread with no butter & went missing for another ten minutes.

Sunday 08/02/15 at around 5pm my family and I went in for dinner. I have a severe allergy to shellfish and made sure that when we were seated I informed our server of my allergy. He asked, ""well is anybody ordering shellfish?"" I replied no and he responded, ""well then you should be fine."" We got our food and after two bites I began to itch all over my chest and it became difficult to breathe. My husband could tell something was wrong and immediate notified our server I was having a reaction and he said he would get his manager. I began coughing to the point  where I started to gag and my husband grabbed my Epi-pen and had to stab me in the leg at the table all occurring in front of the restaurant manager and my children. The manager chuckled and made a joking comment about how he had an allergy and he would just go remake my food. I normally get immediate relief after administering the Epi-pen, but not this time. I continued coughing to the point of throwing up. My husband tried dialing 911 but had no cell signal. When he asked the employee if there was a medic or EMT on the mall grounds because my Epi-pen was not giving me any relief and I needed to get to a hospital the employee responded with, ""No we don't. But let me get you your bill so you can hurry up and get her there."" There was never an offer to call 911 and the manager never returned to our table to even check on us!!! My children were in absolute hysterics and panicking because of what they were witnessing. My husband paid the bill and got me immediately to a hospital where I was treated for anaphylactic shock. My blood pressure and oxygen were extremely low and the hospital couldn't believe that an ambulance wasn't called! The doctor said that there had to have been cross contamination and improper food handling for me to have had a reaction this severe. As if that weren't bad enough my husbands friend who was also dining with us called the location and spoke to the manager who acted like the situation was no big deal but said he would refund the charge, that was never done!

Where do I even start with this review. .... 1- I finally agree with my fellow Yelper's, about corporate owned restaurants.  The quality is definitely on a downward spiral.  2- called ahead to make sure that they did not have a long wait time to be seated because of limited time.  3- Got seated right  away a little pass noon. 4 - Greeted by our sweet waitress right away 5- Ordered their Fire Roasted artichokes as a appatizer  6- Tried to order a few of our favorite dishes that are NO LONGER on the menu... Seasoned salmon salad & Carmel Chicken  7- Ordered our lunches, Asian chicken wraps & bun less WELL DONE cheeseburger UNSALTED  & all produce on the side 8- While pulling apart the artichoke, realized it's half Roasted & Half FROZEN  9- Emeditly tried to send it back after a few minutes of tracking down my waitress & finally settled on a bus boy to please bring her to my table 10 - the waitress asks if I want them to continue to cook the one that's pulled apart or bring me out a whole new dish..... huh , yes , bring me a new order 11- Manager comes over to apologize,  I say absolutely understand fluke mistake. .. still I'm smiling  12- Brings out a perfectly fire roasted one...

NOPE NOT  WELL DONE , MEDIUM.  18- Call waitress over again, says AGAIN I'm sorry. I'm so hungry at this point I say... Please just finish of my original patty on the grill because I'm starving and have plans 19- Again same Manager comes to the table to apologize.... at this point I'm getting delirious /annoyed and just want the meal I ordered and get OUT OF THERE. 20- Brings out the correct meal that was ordered over a hour previously  21 - Plan's get canceled call my other daughter to just come there and order her food for take-out  because our quick lunch has now stretched over a hour half. 23- Might as well order cheesecake since our original plans are IMPOSSIBLE.  24-  Almost 2 hours into our Nightmare lunch the Manager comes back to say "" Your burger is on us today "" REALLY!!!!  How about the fact that both my girl's value their days off!? you've ruined our plans!? How about the fact that your a restaurant & NOT a prison but i felt as though i just served 3-5yrs!?. ...

202,Daniel D.,"Corona, CA",1,60,30.0,2.0,2015-10-20,"Just like a strip club on a Tuesday at lunchtime, this Cheesecake Factory Restaurant did not have their 'A' squad working.  When I arrived I informed the Hostess that I had another person meeting me who would be coming from work and that I would prefer to be seated so I could order ahead. I was promptly seated and the Hostess said she would  seat the other half of my party once she arrived. I gave the Hostess our names for easy reference.  The Server came by as I was looking over their beer list. They only have three (3) beers on draft, but did have several bottle beers. I passed on the beer and told the Server this was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory.  The Server said to let her know when my party arrives  (guess she wouldn't be able to see her sitting there) and did not offer me water or another type of beverage, obviously adhering to the Governor's mandate to reduce water use. After sitting in my seat for approximately 10 minutes, my Server offered me some water (this was after 1p.m. and the restaurant was slow). I informed my Server that I was ready to order our food.  I ordered a hamburger that came with a small salad and and asked for Italian dressing. My Server said that they did not have Italian, but had ""Thousand Island."" I then asked if that was my only choice, which she replied, ""I only said Thousand Island because it's close to Italian."" Huh??? They actually have Balsamic Vinaigrette which is closer to Italian than Thousand Island. I asked my Server what type of condiments come on the hamburger because it's not listed on the menu. My server then replied, ""I think it comes with mayonnaise, but I'm not sure."" Huh???? Hamburgers are kind of a common lunch food. You would think that the server would know what came on a hamburger. When the other half of my party arrived, she was not directed to where I was sitting. She gave the Hostess our names, but was told by the Hostess that she ""was free to walk around the restaurant and look"" for me. When the food arrived, the food runner was real nice and attentive. I asked that my burger be cooked ""Medium."" It came pre-cut and it was obvious that it was under cooked as you could see the blood being soaked up by the bread.  This review only covers lunch, as I've never been there for dinner. I'm hoping their dinner staff is much more competent then the lunch staff that I dealt with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=200,3.68,3.6,3.544,3.0160000000000005,3.6320000000000006

About 20 minutes after we finished our food and we were looking around for our waitress another waiter walked up and gave us a bill... Now the bill he set down wasn't ours and after we got it corrected it took another 15 minutes for him to pick it up.

196,Ann P.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,18,2.0,5.0,2016-05-16,"Cheesecake factory review Mother's day 5/8/16  Mother's day the choice was 'Let's do take out"" The idea of waiting beyond an hour for a table was just not an option for us. I called into my favorite spot at Tyler mall.  Without writing a book, I will give you a short story. I realize Mother's day is the busiest day of the year for restaurants, and it is so easy for things to go array. I drove from Beaumont and decided to call and place an order for three dinners and an appetizer.  Yes, Palm Springs is closer but the food is hands-down superior at the Tyler mall location!  When I arrived, it was a packed house with standing- room only and more folks outside.  Allison, was very friendly and professional, greeted me with a warm smile. I gave her my name and asked if my orders were ready for pick up.  Allison replied, ""Yes your order is right here"". Talk about timing, we did not have to wait even two minutes. My heart went out to those who looked like they had camped overnight.   Upon arriving home my Mom, stepdad and sister were delighted with their selections. Steak Diane & Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Madeira, Center Cut chops, Appetizer (Meatballs). The presentation of the dinners was spot on and the taste Fantastic & delicious!  However, my appetizer was less than satisfactory.  Cheesecake factory has always been one of my favorite places to dine, but somehow something went very wrong.  Normally I go on Yelp and do a review but my thoughts were no way can I badmouth my favorite place. I will go in and speak with a manager the first chance I get.  Well, it just so happened that my mom wanted to return on Wednesday and pick up two dinners. Yes, the same two she had on Mother's day.  When we walked in Cynthia greeted us with a warm smile and took our order. I asked if a manager was available to speak with me. Cynthia said, ""Yes he is right here"". I introduced myself and explained what took place with my order on Sunday.   Right away Joe, the manager apologized for the mishap and said he would like to make things right for me. He comped me an order of meatballs to go. Joe and the chef came out smiled and waved at us as we were leaving.  I told Joe that I would be going on Yelp and leaving a review. I appreciate the kind service that I received.   My hectic schedule prevented me from writing this review the same day, Wednesday 5/11. I had a free moment and thought now is the time! I jumped online and called the restaurant to ensure that I had remembered the correct name. Joe or John, this is what I get for not writing it down right away.  A charming sweet voice answered ""Cheesecake Factory may I help you"" It turned out to be the GM, Diane; we talked for about 20 minutes or more. I feel Blessed that she took the time to speak with me and understand my concerns. I am confident that Diane will make certain that her staff is in accord with Cheesecake Factory standards & procedures.  Thank you to Allison, Joe (manager), Chef, Cynthia and Diane (GM). You are wonderful and I do appreciate your efforts in turning my experience around. Cheesecake Factory continues to be my top favorite!

I am infatuated with the shrimp and steak combo. The shrimp came perfectly crisp and in a wonderful sauce with huge roasted garlic cloves and fresh tomato bits and it was just so good.

I pick up the food, didn't check what it looked like and got home. When I opened at home, I got a buttery oil noodle like pasta, opposite of chow mien style, with a small chicken breast with bone. The complaint is, when I'll called back to ask what was my order they said Garlic noodle, I said ok, I wanted a chow mien style of noodle pasta.  They said we don't have that.  I said well you did when I called to order.  with a very frustrated response into a 45 second phone call, she said *itchingly ""do you need to talk to a manager"". I wasn't trying to escalate things just was trying to get an understanding of their menu and food.  So I said no, don't need to complain or be a burden on a manager just wanted to know if you served what I was trying to get.  A long pause on their side, so I said well I guess not so I guess thats it for our conversation.  She hung up the phone. There is 2 stars because of the gal who walked back and forth to my truck in the heat to bring me my food, otherwise 0 for blatantly ignorant customer service.

223,Alex W.,"Alhambra, CA",138,17,6.0,3.0,2016-06-19,"This Cheesecake Factory location has many strong points to show for. Having been here a few times, here is my feedback on my overall experience here: WAIT TIME: It depends on if you're coming in for lunch or dinner but expect wait times of approximately 1 hour to 1.5 hours during dinner hours and wait times vary for lunch hours. On one occasion, I came during lunch and the wait time was shorter than 5 minutes while on another occasion a dinner wait time was almost an hour and a half. INTERIOR: The setting is cordial with a dim light setting. The seats and tables are of a decent size however they generally tend to be on the intimate and smaller side in size. Floors and general areas are clean.The restrooms can get messy quickly on busier days. SERVICE: Great service and attentive to refilling drinks or bread. FOOD: Great quality and consistent between pasta, pizza or burger options as far as taste and flavor go. The dishes are relatively balanced and aren't over or underflavored.  I would recommend this location if you're looking for a small or larger group spot to have a meal at. Prices are a better bargain if you can make it to their lunch specials and dinner prices for most plates are around $15 or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=220,3.28,3.56,3.54,2.7960000000000003,3.4480000000000004

I couldn't wait to dig in..but here's the thing- when I had a bite of my pasta da Vinci, it was sooo sweet. After the 3rd or 4th bite my taste buds wanted a different flavor and crunch. My sister got the pesto pasta that they made specifically for her but unfortunately it was super dry! There wasn't enough sauce on it and the mushrooms weren't cooked all the way, so they tasted bitter...the check was about $50. We took it to-go and when we got hungry again later at home, we actually salvaged it with other ingredients and more cheese and it was much better! Nearly perfect.

We had not been offered drinks or appetizers, no one had come to our table at all. There were maybe 4 other tables with people sitting at them in their dining room all of which had been waited on. At about 5:00pm my husband and I decided to walk out without being served anything and go to Red Robin instead. I was very disappointed with this service. I expected way better service considering the price of the menu items.

Cheesecake Factory features a huge menu with a wide variety of selections including appetizers, pastas, salads, meats and even pizza.  I have tried many items here: Chicken Bellagio, Pasta Carbonera, Steak Diane, Chicken Madeira, Cuban Sandwich, Beef Dip, Fettuccine Alfredo, Four Cheese Pasta and Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken.  I like all of the meals but would say that my favorite is the Chicken Bellagio. Bread and butter is brought to your table before your meal shows up and the soft drinks are served in large glasses.  In my last visit my family's meals were all brought to the table except for mine and they were almost finished when my Cuban Sandwich showed up.  I did not see my server at all while my sandwich was missing so the service was not top-notch.  My Cuban Sandwich was awesome though but the French Fries could be better. There is an insane selection of Cheesecake available and they are awesome too!  I have not had a Cheesecake yet that I did not like.  I have had: Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake, Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, Tiramisu Cheesecake, Key Lime Cheesecake, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake and Pumpkin Cheesecake.

The best one you can get if you like chocolate & peanut butter. 4.5 Stars - Banana cream (best fruit based cheesecake I've tried)  + strawberries makes it even better in my opinion. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough  4 Stars - Craig's Crazy Carrot Cheesecake (probably the best carrot cake combinations you can get), White Chocolate Raspberry, Godiva, Snickers, Salted Carmel, Adams Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake. 3 Stars (still good & worth getting, not as great as others) - Ultimate Red Velvet (good, but not the best combination of Red Velvet Cake)  Oreo (looks amazing, taste good not great) Lemon Raspberry Cream, Tiramisu, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut 2 Stars Lemon Key Lime (unless you really like key lime pie, don't get)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=20,3.08,3.27,3.436,3.124,3.194

I don't usually eat at chain restaurants. Last time I dined in a CF was 7 years ago in Boston. It was pretty decent based on my memory.  This particular location is clean snd spacious. I came after 3pm and there was still a line. Luckily I came alone so I just sat at the bar with no wait. Best seat in da house anyway IMO.  I started off w/ a mojito b/c I saw some enticing pictures on Yelp. Man oh man, I'm so glad I ordered it. My mojito was so refreshing and absolutely delish! The size was pretty generous, too. For my meal, I went with Thai glazed salmon and substituted rice with a side salad. My server recommended two Asian dressing to go with my salad. Her recommendations were spot on! The salad hit the spot just right! My Thai glazed salmon was cooked to perfection. The mojito got me buzzed quickly so one drink I'm done.  For a chain, the Cheesecake Factory exceeded my expectation! I went shopping with a full belly afterwards. A word of caution: buzzed shopping IS drunk shopping.

112,Luis V.,"Riverside, CA",164,1,,1.0,2017-01-30,"Good food, terrible service. Came there on Friday 1/27 to Celebrate my birthday with my family. Arrived around 4pm not a terribly busy time, there were people but not a lot. Asked for a table for 5 and was told we'd be seated shortly. While we didn't wait long for our table about 3 parties came in after me with about 3-4 people each and were all seated immediately and ahead of us while we were told to wait. This was the first sign but I gave it a pass as again we didn't have to wait that long.  Finally we were seated and usually the one thing I look forward to when we come here is a fresh basket of bread once we're seated, but we were served nothing. Our server came about 5 mins later and took our drink orders, my mother initially ordered a coke but changed her mind and asked the server if they served hot tea which she promptly replied yes. Now my mother asked if the tea was served per person or by table as some other restaurants do and our waitress seemed completely perplexed. As my mother tried to explain to her what she meant our waitress rudely interrupted her and said and I quote ""You know what let me take their drink orders first"" as she pointed to me and my girlfriend. Even though she was still taking our order she was too impatient to hear out my mother which I found very disrespectful. She took our drink order as well as our appetizer order and we didn't see her for another 10 minutes when she finally brought out the hot water for the tea. But surprise! there was no tea bags to go with the tea. When asked for it she said ""Oh we serve a selection here, let me bring it out for you"" to which she promptly disappeared. After about 20 minutes we hadn't seen her and we haven't even been able to order our main course yet. Finally another waitress comes by with our appetizers and we had to ask her for the tea selection, the bread, and for her to take our order. I'm assuming she was just a food runner but now she had to do all this because our originally waitress wasn't doing her job.  Once the food was all out we enjoyed our time and our original waitress finally came back but then came the next issue. We had 3 plates that needed to be boxed for togo, now I did not know that for Cheesecake factory they will box the food for you so I was surprised when they took our food and boxed it for us. We were given back our food and for the rest of the night we thought nothing was amiss. The next morning when going to heat up our leftovers we come to realize that the we were given the wrong food! We were given someone else's togo order. We called the restaurant and we're transferred to store Manager Chris who promptly agreed to fix the situation if we brought in the mistaken food, sounds like everything's okay now right? Nope! I come in with the food and go straight to the front desk and spoke to I believe her name was Caitlyn, I politely asked her that I came to speak to their Manager Chris and she said ""Okay I'll have someone get him for you."" I stood there for 5 mins and saw her make no notion to signal the manager whom I could clearly see from where I was standing. I went back up to her and asked her again and she acted surprised like she mistakenly misheard me the first time so she asks for my name and tells one of her coworkers named Deedra to go get the manager. Deedra leaves in what I assumed was to go get the manager and she comes back telling me ""He'll be right with you"" so I say okay and I wait...and wait...and wait... 10 mins pass and no manager, after 20 mins of watching Caitlyn and Deedra chatting it up at the front desk I go up to both of them and tell them that this wait is ridiculous and Deedra simply tells me ""Oh he's busy right now"" which I question how she knows since she hasn't left her post in 20 minutes. After over half and hour of waiting I was sick of it and went to the back myself and got the manager because the employee's were to incompetent to help me. And guess what! The Manager Chris tells me that he was never called or told that I was there for him. So not only was I made a fool and waited for over 30mins these two servers Caitlyn and Deedra lied straight to my face. What kind of customer service is that where your employees will lie to your customers face because they're too lazy to do their jobs? The Manager Chris was exceptional and did everything to right the issue, he replaced the food that was mistakenly given to us, gave me free bread and a free slice of cheesecake but I was still extremely infuriated with the service. How does one get 2 straight days of terrible customer service from the same establishment from 3 different people? One person would be on them but when its 3 different people there's obviously an issue with the workplace.  Honestly the food is still delicious and the only reason I would come back, but to whoever reads this be it management or corporate, Deedra and Caitlyn need to be reprimanded for their deplorable customer service.

I was a bit thrown back at the fact that the restaurant seemed unkept. The floors were filthy, the walk way in the lobby looked as though drinks had been spilled, the floor under the table across from us had pickles and lettuce all over it. In the woman's restroom the trash cans were overflowing with paper towels and the stalls were not tended to. When I was returning to my table I slipped on a price of food. Embarrassing! I ordered the avocado toast, a dish I've ordered often and absolutely love. When my food arrived I immediately took a bite, my excitement was short lived when my mouth filled with the taste of burnt toast. Now I know toast is usually slightly dark but this was blackened.  When the waitress came to check on us we let her know that my dish was burnt. She immediately took it back and sent over the manager. When the manager arrived he started with, ""I'm sorry you feel it was burnt but that is how toast is made."" Then proceeded to explain the correct way to toast bread. Before I could speak he interrupted with, ""What else can I bring you?"" I told him I had lost my appetite and would not like anything else. Then he quickly responded with, ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but the dish was made correctly."" No apology then walks away. He was so rude in the way he spoke to me the waitress apologized for his behavior.  She had the dish removed from our bill. The manager should have done that but he offered no accommodation for the over cooked food. Feeling irritated and lectured, I grabbed my purse and headed for the door. After paying the bill and tipping the waitress, who was great by the way, my husband got the managers attention and told him that he didn't appreciate the way he spoke to me or how filthy the restaurant looked.

I requested that we order before we got seated so that they could start on our order, and she graciously allowed it, knowing that we had been waiting for a while. I'm pleased with the way she handled this stressful situation. As far as the food goes, it's exactly what you would expect... huge portions, lots of calories, and generally good. I really don't have much to add in this department that others haven't mentioned before me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=80,3.04,3.13,3.368,3.408,3.094
232,Ron M.,"Riverside, CA",0,33,2.0,5.0,2017-06-20,Ok so I did a recent review of how bad the experience was we had.  We have an onion allergy and it all went bad. The manager even helped us pick out items with out onions first bite full of onions. If daughter took a bite it would have been a hospital visit.  Well since then we got a call from corporate and asked to visit them again. This last visit was great.  The server Veronica M went out of her way with how busy she was she made sure everything was perfect. Very impressed with this visit and glad we gave it another chance. This allergy sucks and considering it came on over the last couple of years it isn't we don't like onions my daughter and I both do but she is deathly Ill to them now and I get very sick. So for them to not really research the first time was bad so the second time they did just that and made it a great experience. It sucks not to be able to eat out due to onion and onion powder.  So thank you again Veronica for making it such a great b day dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=220,3.2,3.17,3.368,3.4760000000000004,3.182

40,Mitchell C.,"Corona, CA",81,63,,4.0,2017-07-26,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. They have a massive menu, but I am prone to regret so I always stick to the few dishes that I know will satisfy me. I typically order either a Kobe burger or the stuffed chicken tortillas and both are top notch entrees. They give you free bread (squaw, I think, and sourdough), but be careful because it's easy to get carried away and soon enough you're too full for the actual meal you're paying for. It's dimly lit and could be great for a romantic date night, but I've only gone during peak hours and I've had to wait anywhere between 15-40 minutes for a table. The non-booth tables are pretty compacted. If you're not lucky enough to get a booth, it's common to have complete strangers dining three feet away from you on either side. Can't post a review for The Cheesecake factory without giving a shoutout to the cheesecake. I love cheesecake. The Cheesecake factory has great cheesecake. They offer different variations and flavors and I'm sure everybody would be able to find something that they like.  I've been here several times and the customer service is always decent to very good so no complaints on that front.

I'm not crazy about the coffee, though.  All the desert entrees are at least $7.95. The Cuban sandwich is terrific. The pork is lean and flavorful, it's loaded with pickles and a great mustard sauce.

Cheesecake Factory food is decent and moderately priced, but it's honestly a hit or miss. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's lacking just a bit and that's just the way these places are depending on the staff and kitchen. I'm not one to want voluntarily go to cheesecake factory, but if a friend wants to meet there for lunch, I won't say no. If I ever do ""crave"" cheesecake factory, it would be for either dessert after I had just eaten elsewhere; because their cheesecake is delicious, or for Sunday brunch since the food is definitely different from what they serve throughout the week. My personal favorite is the chicken and waffles benedict, which is as you'd expect, chicken and waffles in egg's benedict form, it's definitely on the heavier side and will fill you up for only $13.  Service was top notch however, especially during my experiences at brunch hours on Sundays.

To start when checked in we were given a pager and advised there was a wait roughly 20-30 minutes, not a big deal. We were advised the pager would go off when our table was ready after the 30 minutes wait our pager in fact went off. When we approached the counter the hostess told us that it's a ""preliminary alert.""  Sooooo confused we were sent to wait another 20 minutes. This was a little weird and honestly felt so dumb. I have never herd of a preliminary alert. Seriously what is that??  We were sat in patio waited about 15 minutes for a server to take our drinks order. We were a party of 8, 5 adults and 3 kids. As we ordered our drinks we also ordered a few appetizers, french fries and fried zucchini.  About 10 minutes later our drinks cane out with sides of bread. The waiter then proceeded to take our meal order. The waiter never ask about ingredients in our food or if everything that was in our meal was ok so everyone ordered there food as normal. So far so good. 30 minutes later our our appetizers came out. Mind you the French fires didn't and we were never advised that they would or if they were being made. Its like the waiter never bothered to enter it on our order. 30 minutes later our meals came out. Everyone's meal came out as expected. I noticed that what I had ordered had cheese, unfortunately I do not eat cheese so I asked for my meal to be replaced. I was told ok and that I would get a new plate. Well 5 minutes later my waiter comes back out with a plate of a supposed new meal. This wasn't the case, the cook decided it would be a great idea to scrape the cheese off of my meal place or back on the grill and send it back out. If I wouldn't not have double checked my meal I would have ate the cheese on what I ordered. I'm lactose intolerant so the outcome wouldn't have been a good one. I asked to speak to the manager. When the manager came out he came out with his hands in looking frustrated, bro it's not my fault Your cook was lazy and decided to do something wrong. With attitude the guy approaches the table asking if we had called for a manager. I advised the guy of what had happened all he said was ,""would you like another one?""  No homie! Your cook is now going to spit on my food or put boogers on my food I'm good man. I'm not going to lie the waiter was apologetic over the whole incident but I'm not going to run the risk of your staff doing something inhumane.

61,Stilly P.,"Riverside, CA",1,17,,3.0,2017-10-07,"I used to hate the Cheesecake Factory. I vowed to not go there anymore because it was so commercialized that the place just screamed out as nothing but advertising whores with food coming second or third on the list that they were good at.  So I reluctantly went last night since it was my mother's birthday and she wanted to go there to eat. I grumbled along the way because when I think of Cheesecake Factory all I can think of is their 90 page menu filled with ads from about 50 other businesses and some of which have NO PLACE in a menu... Well. My previous grumblings (as well as others with the same opinion perhaps?) must have made it to corporate. There was not a single ad in their menu, except to advertise their OWN business which I feel is perfectly fine. It is their menu and they have the right to do what they want (and I have the right to never go again). I had the crispy chicken sandwich, but with some tomato added on and does it really matter the details of everyone's meal? Here is the deal. The food is medium to somewhat pricey. I mean, $13.00 for a chicken sandwich aint REALLY my cup of tea, but it was not too expensive. The chicken portion WAS certainly large and the sandwich was very good.  Food wise- I give them a 7 out of 10 for having above average portions. Value wise I give them a 5.7 out of 10 because their prices are not cheap, but not too expensive.  Ambiance wise I give them a 6.0 out of 10 because there was a group of teens or millennials behind us that kept yelling and shouting to take the picture! Take the picture! Take the picture!  CLEARLY they must not have been able to read the sign outside that said Cheesecake Factory because they thought they were at the Chuck E. Cheesecake Factory with how they were acting. Nobody else complained  I guess and nobody came over to tell them to shut up either... Presentation is where they shine typically though but they make the place so damn dark my mom had to bust out a flashlight to view the menu. I did not go as extreme, but the lighting is certainly a place to take a mediocre chick and make her look almost hot. Presentation gets a 4 out of 10 because they have the place so dark AND because there was a black gnat that I could see hovering over the table (that I swiped at and killed later on).  Had that been a firefly that they had hovering over the table, they would have gotten an 8.5 for presentation because having live fireflies flying around would just be a COOL place to go eat. Even if they had the fake fireflies lights up near the ceiling with the little LEDs and fans to give that firefly ambiance- THAT would be totally cool... In fact, that would be just downright AWESOME. I know they can be way better on presentation though and I intend to return to give them that chance. I see how much time they put into their cheesecakes. I know once they figure out that that same time and application of presentation of the whole place to the customer catches on, that it will be a killer place to go eat... I was just impressed that they removed all of the external advertising from their menu and THAT shortened it down to about 16 pages.  Good for you TCF, now if you could just filter out some of the idiots and noisy jerks that come in... Oh yeah. I almost forgot, they sell Cheesecake slices too. My recco to you is to try a different piece of cheesecake every time you go there, better yet, just go there to order some cheesecake slices. I mean it is cheesecake so how wrong can you go?  This place DOES shine on presentation though and they really enjoy presenting you with various foo-foo types of cheesecake. They have many different flavors from Bacon Blueberry to Unicorn Farts... And, if you have kids that you feel like dragging out with mommy and daddy because you are too damn cheap to get a babysitter- then STAY OUT! We do not want your whiny bratty kids screaming for attention while us Adults are trying to eat and have conversations about other things than sponge bob and u-tube popular channels...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=60,3.4,3.27,3.332,2.636,3.322

Growing up, I never really ate at Cheesecake Factory's and went once during my 8th grade promotion. I was pretty excited to try it once again. Personally, I think Our party had two waiters, who were efficient on getting us water, bread refills, and taking our orders correctly. However, management here seems to be terrible. On a Tuesday night, they ran out of Calamari and Buffalo wings. So that takes a BIG no-no from me. How are you going to run out of those popular appetizers when the week barely started? Anyways, I personally ordered the Americana Burger medium-rare with a side of fries which came out to be 15 dollars. Burger portion was HUGE. 4 of the people in our group each ordered a burger, but only one of us was able to fully finish it. I recommend sharing a meal here, since it will save you money. Taste-wise it wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't worth the price point in my opinion, I'm sure there are better things to order on the menu. Also, it didn't help that the burger couldn't fit in your mouth. Overall, if it wasn't for the excellent service this place would get a 2/5 from me. However I am only criticizing their price points from the burger I ordered and the terrible stock management. Other locations may be better, but as a whole the Cheesecake Factory menu has good variety and it does have that semi-fancy atmosphere perfect for birthdays or nice occasions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-riverside?start=60,3.28,3.23,3.32,2.7960000000000003,3.25

67,Lauro A.,"Jacksonville, NC",10,11,3.0,2.0,2017-11-19,"I just want to start off by saying that I love the Cheesecake Factory. I have always had  good experiences at other Cheesecake Factories, both with quality of food and customer support - Which is why I am disheartened at the experience I received at this location. I came to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my soon to be grandmother in-laws 70th birthday with the family - my fiancé, her parents and siblings - A large party of 7 (5 adults 2 children). We waited about 10 minutes just to be seated. The table that we were brought to was a 6-person booth with a chair hanging out in the walkway for the 7th, which was an awkward sit for my father in-law. The table was extremely cramped and would have been very difficult to try to eat and with everyone seated. When my father in-law tried to talk to a waiter to be seated at a different table we were we were blown off and told to go back to the front area, where we waited for 30 minutes while several other large parties passed us by. It wasn't until my fiancé reminded the hostess that we were still waiting that they made a real attempt to set up a table outside. The staff seemed irritated that they where tasked to set up the table, sloppily and recklessly moved the table after we asked to have to the table moved away from the direct entrance to the patio. After the long wait to be seated we finally started to get some service and our waiter is a lot of the reason that we are not giving this visit 1 star. While the wait left little to be desired we held out for the food. Now the disappointment goes full circle. I ordered the Americana and was not disappointed neither was my fiancé with her bacon ham burger. We had ordered the sweet potato fries in Lou of the regular fries. My fiancé's fries were burnt and mine were cold which is a let-down - I was looking forward to their warm fries. My mother had ordered the teriyaki chicken and we were not informed that they did not cut up the Chicken it just comes out as the breast, bone and all. Now that being an error on our part, the waiter who was praised earlier seemed a bit rude to us while we explained that it was not what we were expecting and wanted to get it fixed up. Now we are getting our desserts and ready to be on our way we wait an additional 15 minutes for our already pre ordered to go meal to be brought to us even though it was prepared at the begging of the meal. Timeline for all of this starts at around 4:30 when we walked in it is now 7 and we are finally able to leave after squaring the check and receiving all of our food.

I am always up for Cheesecake because the food is consistent from location to location, same for the service as well.  Louisiana Chicken Pasta Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce Chinese Chicken Salad Chicken Breast, Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Green Onions, Almonds, Crisp Wontons, Bean Sprouts, Orange and Sesame Seeds. Tossed in Our Special Chinese Plum Dressing. My go-to is always the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. I just love the flavors and the perfectly parmesan crusted chicken. I have yet to find another restaurant that offers a similar dish. My friend ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad. The rice noodles were very interesting. They were piled on high and each length were very long. We weren't sure how to eat them since it's not like one could just take a bite with the salad. We were eating them one by one or trying to crush them into smaller more manageable bite-sized pieces. Overall, the flavors were delicious but it sure seemed like a complicated dish to eat. Parking is horrible, one way and weird mazes to try to exit the parking lot. Just trying to find a parking spot was also confusing, make sure to follow those signs and directions of parking spots! Some people don't care and drive in the lanes, opposite of spots. Overall, flavors were okay here but for some reason, it wasn't what I usually expect out of Cheesecake Factory.
