I should've known walking in when the host seated us and ran that this meal would be problematic. Apparently walking customers to a table, dropping the menus and joining the Happy Birthday sing-a-long is more important than making guests feel welcome.  Our server, Matt took our orders down and a few minutes later brought said orders to the table. We noticed a side of broccoli was missing and we asked for ranch. He never brought those items. We had to wait until the manager strolled around to get our missing items. Matt did stop by to drop our check halfway through our meal ""for our convenience"".....our? We told him we needed it split and I also had to ask for a refill of water at that point. He brought the water but never returned with the checks. Finally, after sitting there for what seemed like an eternity, manager walks past again. We told him we needed the checks and he apologized and said Matt the waiter was flustered, which I don't buy because we saw him standing around chatting quite a bit. Not to mention the place was almost dead - 4 maybe 5 tables of 2-4 people and plenty of servers. We saw at least one other table doing the neck strain/attempt to make eye contact look that was all too familiar from our experience.  We never saw good old Matt other than to take our orders and bring us our check way too early.

We paid the extra $0.99 per entree to get the special garlic herb crusted fries with the shaved parmesan cheese... But they never arrived . So we asked for seconds on the bottomless fries but they didn't come until after we paid the bill because it took so long they forgot about them.

7,David B.,"Cary, NC",0,20,1.0,2.0,2015-02-18,"I have to say recent reviews are fairly accurate.  Service is pretty bad.  Every step of the meal moves at a glacial rate.  The waitress was often not around for extended periods.  I had to flag her down once across the room by waving my white napkin.   An ice tea refill took a very long time even after she had noted mine was empty and asked if I needed refill.  She did not take old glass when she brought a new one.  The new glass had a giant chip on the bottom corner - should have been thrown away.  There was clutter all over the table.  They leave various menus on the table hoping you'll order more drinks or dessert.  Main courses took a long time to arrive - hamburgers! She kind of jammed the check on us while we were still eating but then took forever to pick it up and a long time to return.  The whole meal went like that.   I can say in her favor she was decently friendly but no idea how to do a good job as a waitress.   Multiple tables around us were not cleaned off long after the patrons had left.  There were a lot of empty tables too so it wasn't an over-crowded time.   Here's the topper - when we left there was at least 5 or 6 groups of people waiting for tables.   The food was okay.  The burger was good, the sweet tea was good. Fries were bitter (old oil), daughter's milk shake was not bad, nothing out of the ordinary.  My wife said the Alaskan Crabcake sandwich (close to $15 IIRC) was terrible.  Nothing special here, Five Guys burgers are slightly better and less expensive.   Overall surprising how bad the service is.  There's all these reviews that say that but no improvement.  Guess they don't read Yelp.  One glitch is okay but here it was one thing after another.  I eat at the one in Charlotte occasionally and it has none of these problems.  We won't return to this establishment, that's pretty clear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
5,Chris D.,"Apex, NC",40,22,1.0,1.0,2015-03-02,"It was really my fault. I knew I was at Red Robin- where even their ""signature burgers"" aren't good. Honestly, if you're not even good at making what you're known for, what are we even doing? But acquiescing to the wishes of the rest of my extended family, I found myself at Red Robin on a Sunday night. This was only the first of many poor decisions.  The second was ordering an appetizer. This actually only proved to be disastrous because our waitress forgot to ever put the order in. Explaining to hungry kids that the food they were expecting is no longer coming is a less than thrilling adventure. The waitress was apologetic, but otherwise the action was forgotten. We were admittedly a large table, but we were also one of only 4 tables seated in the entire restaurant. The manager clearly believed (incorrectly) that our lone server could handle it by herself. This might have something to do with the entire staff of the restaurant being under 25 years of age and seemingly (erroneously) believing that they were living out the plot of the movie ""Waiting"". I get it. Service industry jobs are hard and you've got to break up the monotony somehow, but keep the games and flirting in the back- at least while I'm still waiting on my (bad) food.  Our food arrived. Well- most of it. It took an extra 10min to get my 9-year-old his grilled cheese and fries. Clearly that's a complicated order. My crab cake ""burger"" was heinously bad. The ciabatta roll was dry. The arugula was wilted. The ""garlic aioli"" was thin mayonnaise with no detectable garlic or acidity. The crab cake itself was a frozen, straight-from-the-bag holocaust of mushy ""crab"" and bell peppers that tasted like Frisky cat food. My cousin's cheeseburger arrived with an extra hair as a garnish.  Again- this was my mistake. All of this could've been avoided had I merely insisted that my family avoid a chain restaurant that I knew to be particularly bad even among chain restaurants and walk across the parking lot to Tyler's where the food is fresh and no more expensive. Unfortunately I played the peacemaker and ultimately paid the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=20,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.436,2.84

Not sure, it definitely felt strange.  It was a chilly day but there was some sun that helped warm us up. I imagine on a really hot day there would be too sun for it to be pleasant outside.  Menu was re-done from the last time we went (about year+) so a little overwhelming. Anyway food was fine, got a burger and a crispy chicken sandwich with fries. Asked for hot sauce with the chicken sandwich and they remembered it so we did not have to ask twice, which is a plus service-wise!  Got the fruffles for dessert which were pretty good! The picture shows sauce and whipped cream for dipping and they put the whipped cream on plate more for decoration than dipping. They are very rich so took them to go.

11,Vin D.,"Cary, NC",2,22,2.0,2.0,2015-04-16,"We've eaten here four or five times over the past year, mainly because our seven-year-old likes Red Robin for the games in the lobby and grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu. He'd probably give the place five stars when they throw in a milkshake. I was on the fence between two and three stars (probably overthinking here) because although the service is always slower than it ought to be, the staff generally seem like decent people who individually are not out to ruin anyone's night. I'm going with two stars after tonight's visit because of the sticky tabletop and greasy silverware--thankfully I ordered a burger and didn't actually need to touch the greasy fork, but it still gave me the creeps sitting there next to my plate. Speaking of food, it's not that great once you're out of your grilled cheese sandwich phase. The burgers are giant, and a bit expensive in my opinion for assembly line chow, though they do come with every topping known to man. My fries were soggy tonight--think drive-through vintage ten miles down the road. There are better burgers within driving distance--Five Guys comes to mind (I'm sure there are others, but we're still learning the area). My other problem is the service is painfully slow and sporadic. If they're busy, expect to spend close to an hour waiting for your food to arrive. Even when they aren't busy, food takes 20 minutes to reach your table. Maybe that's why they have all those knickknacks on the walls so you have something to look at while you wait. And wait. The biggest disappointment to me is Red Robin doesn't have to be terrible. We used to frequent one in another city that was blazing fast and served hot, crisp fries every time. I wish that one was closer. But then I would probably eat Red Robin too often, and that wouldn't be good, either.

14,Amy W.,"Apex, NC",9,19,3.0,5.0,2015-09-09,"Some of these negative reviews patrons left for Red Robin are ""for the birds""! Okay, Red Robin isn't some hoity-toity, fine dining restaurant, and shouldn't be compared to or reviewed as such. Red Robin is the go-to restaurant for families with children. They have TV's, arcade games, balloons, crayons and activity placemats, they sing loudly to customers with birthdays, they serve milkshakes, burgers and ""bottomless"" fries, etc. This all isn't for the snooty, formal-dining adult, it's to keep young diners entertained throughout the meal. Red Robin is known for their good food, large portions and fair prices, and this is what we always receive here. The restaurant is always clean, the service is always prompt, and the food is always served hot.

The night I went it was practically empty but service was still on the slow side. I ordered a cup of ""french onion""...it looked weird when I  received it....really gooey on top....I then realized why...there was no ""crouton/bread"" in the top of the soup as how normal ""french onion"" soup is made....no biggie just an oversight...I brought it to the attention of my waitress...""we'll fix it"" she said....now she leaves for a long period of time and returns with 2 pieces of bread with yellow cheese on top & a cup of ""beer cheese""....needless to say I was confused....the beer cheese confused me because although I did ask for a side of cheese sauce for my fries with my burger I did not expect it to come out without my meal therefore sitting at the table getting cold (really didn't matter it was gross anyways)....but the 2 pieces of bread with cheese on top were definitely a mystery. Come to find out this was the bread I was to add to my now cold soup! I'm sorry but any establishment I have ever been to would make a whole new soup....this isn't a build you own soup restaurant....the cheese wasn't even the same as the kind that comes on the soup! I must say I was definitely turned off by this. Next came the burger....now I tried to be different and order the ""lettuce bun""....of course I thought the ""bun"" was a big  piece or pieces of romaine lettuce as pictured....nope I received 1/2 of a head of iceberg lettuce literally cut in half with my burger contents in between....my burger was completely unmanageable & unedible. I literally had to dissect it....take out all the hard unedible pieces and try to assemble my own wrap. I was definitely not a happy birthday girl as this is why I was out that night. I'm not sure how long this particular Red Robin has been in this location but I am not a fan, which really sucks because I just moved to the area and I truly do love Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.12,2.96

They brought out one burger that was wrong. Another one that was raw. It took over twenty minutes to bring out another properly cooked burger. Also asked for crispy fries at the start. The only Timmons I received them was five minutes after the last burger arrived, and well after all of the food on the table was eaten. I heard ""I'm sorry"" about a dozen times. When the manager showed up and I told her that my order was wrong, she responded with a sarcastic answer. By the way her name is Kristen, as she repeatedly told me every time she came out to give us the heating progress of the raw burger. When I called her out on the sarcasm, our dinner was free.

They bring out a very small portion of fries and they were cold to boot. It was a while before we were asked if we wanted more fries. Our waitress said it would only be 5 minutes. 20 minutes later we are still waiting for our fries.  Our orders were missing sauces and sides so we had to wait for our waitress to bring us the items.

Kiosks on the table to increase efficiency and reduce wait staff now gives license for wait staff to ignore you. Remember those bottomless steak fry baskets? Not anymore - sure, the menu says bottomless but they start you with a little metal sleeve of fries now and then drag out bringing you any refills until you just want to go back in the kitchen and make them yourself. The burgers are still pretty good but the prices just keep climbing. The whole experience has declined from the decor and cleanliness to the up-selling of apps, drinks and desserts to the downscaling of the food and service.

31,Steve P.,"Bowie, MD",42,2,,1.0,2017-07-16,"Came in for lunch with my family on Saturday 7/15. Waited at the front door area way too long for someone to walk up and decide to seat us. It was not at all busy and there is no reason for that at all! First negative review was that when you walk in, they advertise a deal for buying a $25 gift card with a free movie ticket. We start by asking our server if we can buy the gift card and then use it during our lunch. Apparently Red Robin will not allow this because you can only use a gift card 6 hours after purchase which is absolutely ridiculous. They would still be getting our money so why deny this? Well, I will tell you why...its so they can get more money out of you. The server should have sent his manager over to speak with us but he did not. We probably would have bought the gift card either way but you had no sales tactic or motivation to work with your customer so we will spend that money elsewhere. We will learn later in our visit why and what type of server he is which is lazy and not motivated for sales whatsoever.  Second and most important part of this review...our server. He starts our visit by telling us it has been a slow day so far. Keep in mind it is just lunch time so to say you are having a slow day is a bit concerning because it is ONLY lunch time!!! He then tells us that he will be going home early based on this. This should have been a red flag for us because once somebody decides to tell you their life story and their issues, it generally means that it will not be a good visit but we went with it because we thought that since he had a slow day, he would be at the top of his game for serving us. WRONG!  Regardless of how slow it was, this lazy fool was not focussed on taking care of us or the interests of Red Robin. He was focussed on going home and we were standing in his way.  We had to ask for refills, he didnt even bring us our food...someone else did, he screwed up our endless fries order and most importantly he kept trying to rush us out the door by coming by and asking if we knew how to use the payment tablet on the table and clearing our table and standing over us while we were trying to finish our meals and have lunch conversation as a family. Listen buddy, I know you are trying to leave but we dont need you standing over us and rushing us out because all you are doing is screwing yourself and your potential tip. If you want to leave so bad, just come by once and tell us you are transferring our tab to a more capable server that will actually be there and is not being sent home. Your schedule has NOTHING to do with me and my family and the money we are spending at Red Robin!!!! So when he comes for the last time to stand over us and try to clear more off the table and get us out, I make a statement ""You must be trying to get out of here"" and his answer is ""yes, I am...you are my last table and I am going home"". Again...this is lunch time!!!! And we are your last table!?!?! Clearly there is a reason you are being sent home.

They took it off the bill (which they should have) but still were extremely rude and not at all accommodating. Our server did not come back ONCE even though neither of us got drink refills. Oh actually, at the end he came to bring the check and blames his lack of attention or service on the fact that he just got a 32 person table. Completely understandable..... except for the fact that the table had 17 people at it and was already being taken care of by 2 different servers..... it was a little busy in there but not really.

Originally it took off the hamburger, then we added a tip.  When we swiped the card it asked us to add the tip again and added back the previously free hamburger.  We removed the hamburger and added the tip and swiped the card, then selected to option for the tablet to print a receipt which it did not do. We went to the bar and requested a receipt and the hamburger was added back and the tip was gone.  We eventually go it straightened out, but not without significant difficulty.  No one is going to Red Robin because they have the best food.  People are going for an easy, pleasant experience.  The tablet poses significant issues that significantly detract from the experience.  There are many other casual dining restaurants to choose from without experiencing that difficulty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-apex,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

Ranging from 10-13$ for a burger, albeit generally a large portion size but still very pricey. They do have smaller, less expensive options.  The one star rating is due primarily to their lack of delivering to their tag line. When you say that you have bottomless fries, it tends to make you believe that you will receive, well, bottomless fries (within reason of course).  After requesting ONE additional refill on the fries, it was never delivered. Asked the staff there twice and the extra order never arrived.  Waited at least 15-20 minutes and the order never arrived.
