The wait can be epic here and is it really worth an hour wait? So we checked in and went browsing in the near by stores. When we finally got our table the waitress was nice and took our order. The drinks took a little while, but the restaurant was packed. I got the two for twenty deal with my brother, so we got an appetizer to share and each got a main coarse. The guacamole and chips appetizer was pretty tasty. I got the chicken quesadilla salad for my main course. I really liked it only complaint is they put a little bit too much dressing. If the place isn't packed its an alright place to get food, but not really worth waiting an hour over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4?start=120,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

The waitress was nice but overly perky.  She actually drew a heart on the bill in pink highliter. I went with a friend and we ordered the deal where you get two dinners and a shared appetizer for $20.00. We had the half order of Texas cheese fries and they were pretty good with melted cheese, crumbled bacon, and sliced jalapeños and ranch dipping sauce. I ordered the margarita chicken which came with rice and black beans. It wasn't bad, just uninspired; I felt like I could have thrown it together myself at home - without a recipe.  My dinner companion ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. I had several bites, but she expressed it best ""It wasn't, (dramatic pause) ba-ad. I'm not saying I'd come back here and have it again, but it was o.k."" Let's be honest.  Who really wants to get all dressed up and pay sit down restaurant prices for just ok?   Well... There was that cheerful little pink heart... What I would return for was the chocolate chip paradise pie. It was a warm chewy bar made with coconut, walnuts, and chocolate chips topped with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge and caramel sauce. Yum !

With your preform corporate food and classic big business impersonalism. You are everything that makes a restaurant suck. Where do you find your cooks? Denny's rejects? How can you NOT cook pre-packaged food? Thank Raytheon for the microwave oven or you'd be out of business. What a joke. Rude wait staff, incompetent cooks, hosts who would rather be ANYWHERE but there. It all comes bursting through in vivid detail the minute you step out of your car. This kid will never be back.

We went to the to go door and waited for someone who informed us they arent doing the ""to go thing"" tonight but to wait at the bar and he will take our order.  we went to the bar and waited... nothing, he was pretty busy and didn't have the time.  So out of frustration i called the restaurant over and over while waiting at the bar and watched MULTIPLE waitresses stand around and socialize while letting the phone ring.   We then went to the front where you would regularly walk in and the F*ing hostess was to busy texting to even look up and ask about seating!  I honestly shit you not! there's a picture to go with this.... Anyways we told her we wanted Oscar to place a to go order for us and she said sorry you have to go to the bar and we said no we've been there waiting and once again she said sorry he cant do that.... Then Oscar walked up shook our hands and had our order ready within 5 min and asked if we needed a water while we wait and HE apologized for the nonsense everywhere.   My question is wheres the management?!?!?!!?  Really it's amazing how long the girl at the front was texting and ignoring everyone from customers to her own team members.  Welcome to chilis we like to ignore you until you ask us if you can sit in the EMPTY booths that were everywhere on the restaurant side.  What an Epic fail!

My coworker and I sat at the bar because the wait was over 30 minutes on a week day during lunch! As soon as we sat down the bartender mentioned how busy she was. We already knew what we wanted and we told her that. She asked us to wait because she still had other customer's orders to take. As we ate our dessert for lunch ;) we watched her put a pitcher under the Blue Moon tap and turn it on. She walked away.  About 5 minutes later she noticed the beer was over flowing the pitcher and flowing down the bar. She ended up wasting the beer by the way. Fail! She finally gave us the check and ran the card, but ran the wrong amount!! She did correct it after I asked her to. Horrible service the entire time we were there.

I ordered what I've always had, which is their cadillac style chicken fajitas and it was fresh and tasty the way food should be. My husband had a fajita chicken salad, which was surprisingly super fresh and very tasty and our waitress was fast, courteous and friendly. Everything seemed to go well until the tail end of our meal when another waitress that was not helping us came up behind our table with an attitude as she started ranting that we couldn't use the outlet plug. She was super rude and my husband and I tried to explain that the hostess is the one who allowed us to use the outlet for our laptop and that we were just leaving anyway. She was obviously angry and kept complaining that it should have not been done etc. She made a huge ass deal and it ruined the wonderful meal we had.

It never came to the table.  This family member had waited for 1 1/2 hour and still no food.  Insult to injury, they charged her half price. For starving her  all that time.  They should have  not charged  her  at all.  Her husbands Vegetables were nearly raw and the meat overcooked.   I was totally shocked....that they charged her. A man was with the waitress and it appeared he told her to charge half price as if that was a  good thing.   People don't usually complain anymore they just don't return.          Chili's may be out of business soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4?start=120,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.244,2.6

We waited at the other 2 benches in between the first and second door and boy do they need some air in there. It's pretty stuffy waiting in that area.  Got sat and our waitress was pretty attentive. Looked like she wasn't happy at first but as time went on she seemed like she got better.  So here's our order: Drinks - 2 Arnold palmers one strawberry and one with mango (btw mango is so bomb!) Appetizer- triple dipper samplers (spring rolls, boneless bbq chicken and the mini burgers) all were pretty tasty! Main course - Crispy crispers: came with chicken strips corn & fries.  It was pretty much mediocre. They could have added a     bit more flavor or seasoning on the chicken. It was kind of bland.  Sweet & smokey burger: burger was pretty good according to my boyfriend.

At 11:23 I was given a drink, and by 11:28 there was a bowl of soup placed in front of me. Seriously ten minutes for a drink that is literally 20 feet away. A turtle would have gotten it to me faster! Anyhow more time goes by and at 11:36 another waiter? brings over my cheesburger (barely warm) and fries (room temperature). I informed the waiter that none of my food was hot. He was gracious and apologized, and offered to have the food made again. My lunch ""hour"" is only 45 minutes, and I did not have time for another 23 minute wait for a cheeseburger and fries. So I just left. If the staff would have delivered the food at like15 to eighteen minutes, it would have been fresh and hot. The food actually looked good, but I guess I won't ever know.

Bottom of the cups looks unclean. There was a dead earwig bug and even after we brought it to the waiter attention she didn't care.  I think they need to get the health department check redone.

My sister and I ordered a Michelada with Modelo. Worst Michelada I have ever had. It just did not taste good at all and had me cringing and neither my sister or I could even finish them. I make better micheladas at home and that's saying a lot for a white girl. Waited 45 min for our appetizers alone and then another 15 minutes for our food. My sister and I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta. The meal itself was good, the bread left something to be desired though. We usually wait to get the check from the waitress but after waiting so long for everything else I was not going to wait 20 minutes for the waitress to appear again so I paid by the little machine on the table which was so much faster and easier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4?start=60,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.6960000000000006,2.68

The service 90% of the time is terrible. I order the same thing every time with an hour lunch and it seems to take them  30 minutes to bring me my drink, soup and house salad. Today i ordered my drink in a to go cup and just a bowl of soup it took 40 minutes to get my soup and he brought my drink in regular cup. Now lets say i put my card in the table to let him know i want my receipt since there is no kiosk tablet on this table and no sign of him, let me say by this time i have 15 minutes to get back to work from my lunch break. So still waiting and finally someone else comes by saying would you like to pay? Well duh!! I understand most of the people working here are not career waiters waitresses but please really  how hard is it to screw up a dr pepper in a to go cup and a bowl of potato soup? Really what takes 40 minutes to get these items and let me mind to tell you it was not busy. This is first time even with bad service i didn't leave a tip.

On the kiosk my total was 17$ when he brought me a receipt it wasn't itemized it just said 25.00. I then call over a different waiter and ask for an itemized receipt . Then I noticed he was billing me for the dessert even though I said it was my birthday. Felt like he was being somewhat dishonest with me by not bringing me an itemized total. Leads me to believe that when I left he was going to take off the dessert and take the 7$ on top of what ever tip I was giving . Anyways my tip to you is ask for an itemized receipt .

2,Charles M.,"Bakersfield, CA",81,341,340.0,3.0,2017-08-05,Chili's is just not a restaurant I would frequent. It's loud and the food is mediocre. We went because it was a family gathering and we had no choice. This is the second time we have been to a Chili's and both times we were disappointed. Here the service was good and although the server was obviously new he did a good job and will be an asset to the restaurant. Donna had the chicken fajitas and I had the sirloin leather steak. No seasoning on my steak and cut like an old shoe.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4,2.96,2.86,2.86,,2.9
12,Marie H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,,4.0,2017-08-31,"I enjoy Chili's and always have trouble in deciding what to eat. Usually I always order the same thing when I go out to eat because I know what I like. Here though, I get pasta, steak, burgers, or even salad. They used to have really good potato skins but they've changed the menu since and now have Texas cheese fries which are pretty good.  Regarding the service, it seems to be getting better. Today we were seated next to a very loud group of people and without us even asking the hostess asked us if we would like to sit somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4,2.92,2.89,2.89,,2.902

The food is good.  We LOVE the 3 for $10  special that they run periodically. If that is not available, then we usually order the steakhouse combo or the faitas.  The chicken breast in the steakhouse combo is cooked correctly every time.  It is so moist & never dry. And the endless chips are great. They even stay fresh in the take home bag.  And the staff is great. The red headed hostess, that is now blond, knows us by name & always recalls the area that we like to sit. And  the waiter (John) is quick on his feet & keeps an eye out for the almost empty glasses.  Thank you staff for  always making it an enjoyable evening out!

They definitely picked the best person to be working the phones. Repeated my order back and even showed me what was inside the containers prior to leaving the restaurant to make sure my order was complete. The Texas rub ribs were super tasty.  I will be back!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4,3.52,2.97,2.97,,3.1900000000000004
13,O'Neesha F.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-18,"I decided to take my mother out to eat and we had a bad experience. We received our silverware and i had a piece of food still stuck to my fork. My mother ordered GRILLED CHICKEN FAJITAS and the chicken nor the onions and bell peppers were grilled. Also the wooden plate they served on the bottom of the hot plate was dirty and had old food stains on it. The onions smelled spoiled. I order the 6 oz sirloin and asked for it to be extra well done and it was still pink. And my steak tasted like a hamburger patty. We approach the waitress about the problem but instead of her apologizing she said "" i was not the person serving you guys, and im waitress not a dishwasher.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4,3.36,2.93,2.93,,3.1020000000000003

7,Miriam P.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,4,14.0,5.0,2017-11-28,Chili's is a good place just to go quickly after shopping at target. Food is inexpensive and food comes out fairly fast. You can spend $22 on a dinner for 2! You can't do that in most places. Servers are friendly and helpful bartenders was attentive.

This last time my boyfriend and I tried the meat platter and had queso and egg rolls. The egg rolls are always amazing and of course the queso. The meat platter I didn't care for but my boyfriend liked it. It was $17.99 for a 3 choice meat platter and my boyfriend wanted ribs so it was an extra $2. To me it wasn't worth it but he liked it. We got crispy chicken( which was good with buffalo sauce I ordered), jalapeño sausage (I didn't care for it at all) and ribs (boyfriend wanted to try them since everyone says chili's ribs are good). Bill came out to $37 which wasn't too bad for all the food and leftovers for his lunch the next day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4,3.52,3.04,3.04,,3.2320000000000007

Everything was mediocre, from the tableside guacamole, which was unsalted and lacking flavor, to the margarita, which was so watered down you couldn't even tell it was strawberry, to the steak enchiladas, which were greasy and made with poor quality meat, to the burgers, which had far too much bread for the meat.

I am typically a ""picky eater"", but this location gets it just right every time. Also, the staff is GREAT and the service is speedy. I love the bar area at this particular location. They always have a full staff, the food comes out hot and exactly how I wanted it , the drinks are great and the manager personally approached us today to ensure our visit wasn't anything less than extraordinary. If you're going to go to any Chili's , I highly recommend this location over the Gosford location any and every day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bakersfield-4,3.56,3.05,3.05,,3.254
