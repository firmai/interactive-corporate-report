120,Augusta F.,"Sun City, CA",5,15,,2.0,2014-09-13,"Came here for dinner the day after the grand opening. Although the service was good (which is the only reason for the 2 stars) the food was HORRIBLE. First off, my husband ordered a 4 cheese pasta/chicken dish that tasted like frozen food and had no cheese flavor whatsoever. I ordered the chicken strips meal and the fries that came with it were burnt and tasted like someone dumped a bucket of salt on them. I couldn't even eat it. We didn't complain because we knew they just opened and the restaurant was busy so we figured the kitchen staff was overwhelmed. Still though, we'll probably never eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

Opens at 11:00 am, you can come here for brunch, lunch or dinner.  We wanted to support the place even though we've been to an AppleBees before and pretty much know what the food is like.  I was impressed though, I must say, that while we were waiting to be seated, they were offering everyone frozen strawberry lemonades and even seconds if you wanted some. The hostess was very friendly with my kids and she seemed like she enjoys being at work, something you want to see in a host.  We got seated and realized the place isn't that big at all, but the ambiance of dedication to Menifee was very interesting and kind of cool. They had these computer pads at the table for you to look at the menu, play games (for $0.99), reorder your drinks or even pay your bill. Nice touch, Applebees!  Our waiter was Jimmy, he was nice and knowledgeable of the menu but clearly was nervous, that was fine with me. Still great service! He made sure to put in our entree order a few minutes after putting in our appetizer so that we would have time to eat our appetizer. Which we got the honey barbeque bone-in wings, not bad, but not great either. Maybe we should have went with the buffalo wings instead.  For drinks, I got the frozen strawberry lemonade because it was so hot outside and it was that good, I had to order it. My husband got the blue agave margarita and that wasn't too bad, not strong though.  For my entree, I got the margarita queso chicken and shrimp, very good, but the chicken was a bit dry and the shrimp was cold. Hence why i took a star off. My husband ordered the 7-oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and vegetables, it was good. My daughter got the corn dog and applesauce packet to share with her sister.  Food wasn't spectacular or anything but it wasn't bad either. Service made up for it and I really like the ambiance in there. Good going, Applebees!

118,S K.,"Wildomar, CA",12,26,10.0,1.0,2014-09-16,"Finally. A new place to eat in Menifee. Lets give it a shot. Really?? I mean..REALLY?!  Talk about  bombing a first impression. I'll chalk a little off to this being a newly opened location but being in the food service industry myself and knowing how chain restaurants supposedly ""train"" and ""screen"" before they hire I'm not giving any more than a half a star leeway. So..if I could..this review would only get half a star. After sitting at the bar for about 40 mins my roommates' and my food finally showed up....COLD. Plate was hot though. That's a neat trick that I could teach you but I'm a better person than to do that to my guests. Veggies were thrown into boiling water for 30 secs and served..hard...and raw. Chicken was cold and my roommates supposed ""medium"" steak was not medium. Only reason we both stayed and not complained is we had not eaten all day and were in no mood to wait another 40 mins for fresh food and then worry about what the dishwasher/cook did to our food once he/she heard we complained. After throwing our money on the counter hinting we wanted a fast exit..it took the 2 ""trying to look busier than they actually were"" bartender/waitresses about another 15 mins to finally cash us out.  In closing...save your money..wait and try this place in a couple of months and see if the training/food improves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=100,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

It was too LOUD... too many GAMES on.. everywhere...  2) The menu was plentiful, but limited in sides unless you PAID for a green or any veggie with your meal....  That was dumb. The ""wedge"" of plain old iceberg lettuce was 5 bucks! I was stunned. 3) The appetizers are VERY pricey too. 4) Got the Double Whiskey Steak... basically 2 pieces slightly bigger than a silver dollar... along with red mashed potatoes. The potatoes were outstanding. Thank you, But the steak(s) were tough... and dry.  Don't think we'll be going back....  it's basically overpriced bar food.

I didn't care for the chicken, it was dry and salty.  The dressing was no where close to tasting like what caesar is supposed to taste like.  More like a tangy ranch.  Disappointing.  Husband was fine with Thai shrimp salad.  We will go back and explore the menu further.  Caesar is my favorite salad, hope I can get past that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-menifee-2?start=120,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

This is our 3rd time here since the opening, the first time there were a few mistakes which we figured was because they were brand new, the second time not only were our meals wrong but when I sent mine back it took forever to come back and was still wrong. The party of 3  that sat behind us on the second time, their whole order was incorrect and one of them never got the entree ? The waitress kept offering them appetizers in place of their food, good thing they got a free desert !! We thought we would give it another try tonight , and once again one of our meals was totally wrong. During our meal we heard numerous tables complain about their orders ? My wife had a margarita and it came in a mixed drink glass (tall & skinny ) and was way under par, I ordered iced tea and I had to continually asked for refills ? You couldn't have ordered a easier entree then mine to make and it was so wrong that I changed to something different. I settled for the (new)  peppered shrimp and broccoli pasta plate , OH NO ! Never again! Seriously the junior Master Chefs on TV. ( 8-12) year olds would have given more flavor then that. I find it hard to believe that the chefs or the person that expedites taste the food prior to leaving the kitchen. Just so everyone knows we are big fans of Applebee's just not this one. Hey chefs learn how to blacken shrimp, it's not just covering them in chili powder !!

We were seated fairly quick which was good seeing how busy it looked from the parking lot. Our server Braelynn took literally 6 minutes and 23 seconds to even approach the table (I timed her from the moment we sat). Took 4 minutes and 39 seconds to get just one water and she said the bar was backed up thats why the beer didn't come with it.  We moved to the bar where we met Kristen who took care of us the moment we sat down. Unfortunately the food was below standards. When I got my tortilla soup I knew it had been sitting a while before it was delivered because the tortilla chips were mush.  My stepdad ordered a bacon burger but his burger was delivered with no bacon. My mom ordered the sliders with no sauce, yet they came with sauce.

Unfortunately, the dining experience was not great. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was just terrible. I believe our waiter was overbooked with tables, but that didn't overrule the neglect of service we received. He wasn't very attentive at all, and my brothers girlfriends meal was left in the back while we were all waiting for it, so we could eat.I highly recommend going to a different Applebee's if this is the restaurant of your choice.   Also to add, my brother accidentally left his phone at the table when we were done, he came back twice and even spoke to the manager to find it.

When the server took our order I was surprised that my over priced entree did not come with a soup or salad.  It was an add-on. I ordered 3 kids meals for my daughters it was pizza bites and yogurt. The pizza was actually 2 half slices of garlic bread with way too much tomato sauce and cheese sprinkled on top. My kids only ate their yogurt and did not touch their ""pizza"".  My son and husband ordered burgers and they were not impressed. I ordered a brew house crispy chicken and after one bite, I could not get myself to eat another. The chicken was questionable and tasted gamy. I immediately was disgusted.

20,Erin R.,"Corona, CA",0,13,,1.0,2016-12-27,"I usually enjoy Applebee's, especially the wonton tacos which are my favorite. However, this is the WORST Applebee's there is. The service is terrible, and the food is not cooked properly or with any care for the customer what so ever. We tried to go there twice in one week and both times left angry.  The first time we were seated fairly quickly, but then we just sat there unattended for 15 minutes. At no point did we see a waiter, and certainly I wasn't going to continue to wait around with my 3 children while no one cared about our business for their restaurant. We walked out without ever taking even a drink order. So another few days go by and I really wanted the wonton tacos and they have a burger special on Mondays, so we decided to give them one more shot. There was a 20 minute wait, with half the restaurants tables empty (This is obviously a staffing problem they need to fix). Then we finally get seated only to wait and wait and wait. After 20+ minutes I saw a table seated after us take their order, and that was the last straw. I talked to the manager and he sent over a waitress to take our order. After placing our order she was nice enough to give us free chips and salsa for waiting, however the food took an astronomical amount of time to receive. We ordered 3 appetizers, and a burger yet it took well over 30 minutes to receive them. Once we did receive the food the boneless wings had Asian zing sauce instead of honey bbq and luckily I thought it looked weird and tasted if before I gave it to my 6 year old!! She cant handle the heat, and I would have gone through the roof with anger. They exchanged those for honey bbq after a little bit of a wait, and then the shrimp was cold and OLD but that never seemed to come back out ever again. Nothing we ordered came out right besides the burger. Everything took forever, and I can guarantee we will not go back.

From the service, by the very capable Brittney, to the food from the 2 for $20 menu, everyone was at the very least, content. Even the wallet. After reading several bad reviews, I was singing the song from the Clash: ""Should I stay, or should I go?"" Well, happy we all went. Place was busy at around 7:30 PM, and everyone seemed to be enjoying the time. Food from the limited, but none the less, very acceptable menu was certainly good enough for our hungry crowd. Even though we were only 5, we ordered 3 of the 2 for $20, so some food returned home with us for a later midnight snack! Only water was asked for, and even that was nicely delivered with Brittany's friendly smile. The bill came out to around $67.41?, which was kind of enigmatic, and had me trying to decipher the actual tax being charged, but now a days there are so many surcharges that I simply took it with a grain of salt. 17% was given to our server, surely deserved, and we walked away $74+ less.
