Kelicia C.,"Euless, TX",283,307,262,3.0,6/11/2011,"I was pretty impressed by this Fridays. I mean really what can you truly say about the food that hasn't been said? It's American. It's burgers, fries, steaks, shakes, chicken.....you get it, right? I will say that everyone here seemed to be in a pretty chipper mood. The greetings and salutations were plentiful, the smiles were genuine, and it seemed as though the crew had a commaraderie amongst them that made me ALMOST miss being a waitress. I said almost....it's hard out here for a pimp and I can't go back..... I love their 2 for and 3 for deals....it saved me and the BFF monies for beers! We got a nice 3 course meal and spent 30 bucks. I believe it's a limited offer for summer, but really, they always have it in some form or another.  Say what you will about it, but TGIF is very consistent....I like em!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-irving
Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,2.0,9/22/2010,"All I can say is ""YEESH"" on the service here. Short story of it is that my friends and I were seated by a really rude hostess, it took the waiter 10 minutes to take our orders, he disappeared after that and forty five minutes later I had to flag down the manager to ask where our food was and why the people who had been seated 15 mins after us had already got their food and were almost done. The saving grace was the manager really jumped on it, got us our food, tracked down our waiter, and ended up comp'ing our meal. That's where the -2 stars comes from, it definitely would have been 4 stars otherwise.  We ate the Crispy Green Bean fries for the appetizer and they were yummy yummy. They also sustained us for the 45 minutes we waited for our actual entrees. I really liked the chipotle ranch, too. To actually get to the FOOD, it was really good! I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was so flavorful and tender, I really really liked it. It came with a side of cheese tortellini in a creamy spinach sauce which was also delish. This is on the ""Right Portion, Right Price"" section of the menu and it was well priced at about $8, and I actually had to take some of it to go because I was full, so perfect title for this dish at least. A friend had ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp and although she said her food was pretty good, she said she thought her chicken might have been underdone. The actual flavors she said were good, and she loved her loaded mashed potatoes! My other friend got the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta and it must have been good because I think she actually licked the plate clean. Overall, the food was definitely a good value for your money, if you join their e-mail club you get tons of coupons that really do save you cash, I was just very unimpressed by the waitstaff here. The manager was a great guy though, and did his best to make it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-irving
