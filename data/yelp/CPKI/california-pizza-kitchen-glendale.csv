Thomas D.,"Los Angeles, CA",350,113,495,4.0,9/18/2016,"We made a trip to CPK after not visiting for a while. After our most recent visit, we were thoroughly pleased with the experience. Jessica was our server and she did a pretty good job. She was attentive, informative and made sure we didn't wait long for refills.  The food was awesome! Since we hadn't visited in a while, they were nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer to welcome (major cool points for this). We ordered the BBQ chicken salad, Jamaican Jerk chicken pizza and tequila fettuccine pasta with shrimp. Everything tasted amazing! The strawberry lime margarita is one of their better alcoholic drinks. It's a perfect blend of strawberry with just the right amount of tequila. We will definitely be coming back to CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=20
Destiny N.,"Los Angeles, CA",327,12,,5.0,8/16/2017,"A friend and I came in here to have lunch a few days ago. The food was great as usual (if you haven't tried the jerk chicken pizza yet.....DO SO.) After we left we realized he had left his wallet with $300 cash inside. By the time we realized the restaurant was closed. The next morning we called and asked if the wallet had been found. They took our contact information and said they'd get back to us. Soon afterward, they called and said they found it and put it in the safe. We went to pick up the wallet expecting the cash to be gone but just grateful not to have lost the other things... to our surprise all the cash was inside safely! I just thought that was the most honest, noble thing. This location is a bit far from me but I will make it a point to come to this one whenever I come to CPK! Thank you guys so much, great team and great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=20

Geri S.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",438,720,3065,5.0,2/21/2016,"To start, I've always loved CPK from their appetizers, salads, soups down to their pastas. With that in mind, I called in a take-out order for a cheese and  margherita pizza. When I checked my order prior to leaving, they gave me a five cheese pizza which was different from a regular cheese pizza. Five cheese has fresh tomatoes and basil. It looked good, but it wasn't quite what I wanted or ordered.  We waited another five minutes for the cheese pizza order. After the cheese pizza order arrived, the very kind male manager, who clearly was running around all evening not only helping serve and make drinks, help with the registers and take-out, kindly handed us all three pizzas! He thanked us for so being patient. I already know the pizzas are going to be tasteful because it's CPK, but the manager deserves this five star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=20

Rod D.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,234,7,1.0,10/18/2016,"*Delivery Review* Used Grub Hub for delivery.  The food arrived horribly cold.  Reheating it wasn't enough to revive it. I pointed out the food was already cold when it arrived - the driver indicated that he had another delivery prior.  According to the website tracker, the food was picked up nearly 45 minutes before it arrived. The driver's other drop off was in the opposite direction and quite a bit farther than I live to CPK (less than 2 miles). Total time was well over 1.5hours - website was advertising 40-50min delivery.

Let me tell you, Kati our server was kick ass about her customer service and giving us her honest feedback about the food. I definitely would come back and have her bent server.

Rebekah J.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,47,47,4.0,2/4/2016,"California Pizza Kitchen is located on Brand Blvd in Glendale. This is a beautiful location as it is right near these gorgeous apartments and a fountain with lush greenery surrounding it. It is walking distance from the Americana on Brand and is on the second level.  My boyfriend and I had dinner here the other night. As you walk into CPK, you are (occasionally) greeted by the host or hostess. When we got our booth, our server came to greet us and asked us right away if we would like anything to drink. We got two iced waters w/ lemon and extra lemons on the side. He forgot our extra lemons. We then ordered Bread w/ Olive Oil. That was very tasty and addicting! Couldn't stop reaching for more!  For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered Chicken Tequila Fettuccini. He orders it every time and loves it! I ordered the Hand Tossed Margarita Pizza. It was okay. Just okay. The dough wasn't crispy enough it just tasted very chewy and difficult to cut through with a fork and knife. The toppings were good though.  Our waiter was nice, not excellent nor terrible. Just average. I'm giving them 4 stars and not 3 because although my pizza wasn't perfect and the waiter was average, my boyfriend and I had a great time with each other and he enjoyed his entree a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=20

Priya G.,"Glendale, CA",492,247,236,3.0,1/2/2015,"CPK is a chain restaurant that has a variety of Italian food - pizzas, pastas, etc. It's never my first choice as the food is only slightly above average. Anyway, we had a large group of people visiting so we ordered CPK for everyone. My friend and I went to pick up the order ($70+) and when we got home, we realized that one of the main dishes (chicken pasta) was missing. UGH. Also, when we went to pick up the food, the gal told us that she didn't have anymore bread (it's complimentary so whatever). Upon arriving home and realizing the missing pasta, I called CPK. They put the manager on the phone (a young charming guy from Austin) and he changed my experience completely. He took off THREE dishes from our bill (cut our bill in half) and was so nice to us when we came back! UPDATE (June 2015): I came back here today after having a positive experience over the weekend at the Burbank CPK. I was disappointed, yet again. I ordered a chipotle chicken pizza with no chicken (it was recommended to us by the Burbank CPK and was delicious). I placed my order for take out. Upon getting home, I noticed a large piece of chicken on one slice of pizza and then after a careful examination, noticed that there were SMALL pieces of chicken on other slices as well! UGH. So frustrating since I noticed this after arriving home. I had checked the box quickly at CPK but the chicken was not noticeable until I was in bright light. I called the CPK and spoke with Ismael who was the manager on duty. He refunded the charge and sent me a gift card in the mail to come back. I will go back with my husband and eat in person there since our issues always seem to be with take-out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=20

Firetruck M.,"Los Angeles, CA",148,226,,4.0,7/14/2016,"CPK was my go-to spot in high school. The place I fantasized taking dates had I the charisma or courage to get any girls to go on a date with me. Today, whenever I go to CPK, I hope to be transported back to those halcyon days of high school where eating chicken tequila fettucine and bullshitting with friends seemed like the pinnacle of social achievement. Instead, I am left disappointed that the food isn't as good as it is in my memories. Not sure if it's because I'm older or if the quality has gone down. Still, it's a great place for lunch (good specials) or for dinner if you're in the mood for a shit ton of food that'll leave you with leftovers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60

Susan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,236,988,4.0,5/10/2015,"I really like CPK and eat there too often when I'm craving for some light American fare. There are many favorites on the menu but my review here is for the Glendale location. I love their ""penthouse"" location and view down onto Brand Blvd. There's a delightful, open feel to this establishment. They're pretty hard to come by these days.  Had lunch here last weekend. The two of us shared a full salad (BBQ chicken ranch for almost $15) and a wild mushroom pizza (about $14). The price of the food has really gone up over the years. I still remember the days of $9.95 pizzas here. My usual beverage is the strawberry iced tea. They were nice to accommodate our request for an iced coffee. They don't have it on the menu but they made one for us anyway.  I'm not crazy about their complimentary baguette. It has a raw taste to it. The herbed dipping oil is delicious though.  More than half the salad and two slices of pizza were left over from our lunch. Service was great on a busy Saturday lunch service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60
Maureen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",164,33,656,5.0,12/9/2014,"The staff is attentive. The hostess greets warmly upon entering and asks if any parking validations are needed. I feel this is important as many people forget their parking ticket in the car or purposely leave it as to not lose it.  The waitress we had was very pleasant and energetic which is always a plus. Who likes a drabby waitress right? We asked for a suggestion on a pizza to share and she advised of 3 she likes. We chose the Califonia Club, which surprised with the freshness and crunchiness of the iceberg lettuce and the bacon. The avocado slices on top are a good finishing touch.  The base of the pizza has very little if any marinara. It did have chicken bits and you can add Parmesan cheese at your discretion. I see it as a salad on a pizza... Thin crispy crust of course. I had a yummy small plate arugula salad previous to the pizza and it didn't disappoint at a $5 price. It's comparable to any high end restaurant, to it's shaved Parmesan topping.  We had two slices each and two to go! Great lunch experience.

Pam D.,"Glendale, CA",0,46,,2.0,1/23/2016,"We walked in at about 6 p.m. on a Saturday night.  There were several empty tables but we were told there was a 15 minute wait -- because they only had three servers and they were waiting for more  servers to arrive and start their shifts. I'm sorry, this is a very poorly managed CPK if they don't have enough waiters on a Saturday night. Rather than wait 15 minutes we decided to sit at the bar for dinner.  The bartender was nice, but clearly overworked and frazzled.  It took him soo long to bring my husband his wine that he finally canceled the wine order when he was close to finishing his dinner.

FattyVentures G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,4,1.0,9/13/2016,"Horrible to say the least. It seems like customer service and just being polite has gone out the door. With most establishments in Glendale, the workers seem like they hate their jobs and they let it show.

Wendy G.,"Glendale, CA",56,71,34,2.0,3/26/2017,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon.  I requested a table that had a chair on one side, booth on the other.  Had to wait in the bar for 10 minutes for them to clear it, but then the hostess was seating others and kinda forgot about us until I stood in the aisle to make my presence known, at which point I was told to ""just sit anywhere and I'll bring you some menus."" We were still kind of in the bar area so the lady working behind the bar was our waitress.  I ordered the Thai and Baja Tortilla Spring Rolls, then a Works pizza and my son had the cheese pizza.  I told her to just put all of the orders in and bring it all as soon as it was ready, not wanting the appetizer to stretch the meal time overly long. I had iced tea and he had water.  The appetizer was okay, my son didn't like it (which is really unusual) and the pizza was really thin and kinda soggy on the bottom and not much cheese.  Price tag with tip -$55.   Way overpriced food and okay service, but the entire experience took nearly 2 hours, which is too long.  I think I'm done with CPK now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60
John L.,"Long Beach, CA",199,124,384,5.0,2/6/2016,First off the bartender I think his name is Joe was garbage. He was too slow to even take our orders. Even when he returned my change he basically tossed it back on the counter to me. In a lot of cultures I think that's considered disrespectful and rude. But the reason why I gave 5 stars was because of the manager with the hair combed back and earrings. He was extremely helpful and polite at all times. He was hard and fast working jumping around everywhere to make sure everything was going perfect. He was working under a lot of pressure and it didn't phase him. As a business owner myself it's extremely hard to find a manager as great as him. Cpk should give him a raise in my opinion. Food was good also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60
Amanda N.,"Glendale, CA",0,25,,2.0,5/29/2016,"The waiters at CPK are what makes this location great, so friendly and professional.  If this was a review just for them, it would be ten stars.  I'm sure I've met all of them here.  So thank you to them for always making it a great experience, and they still do.  The waiter on this particular night was stellar. I think this location as a whole is very confused about what they're actually needing to improve, so much that they got a new manager who was literally going back and forth with me over a $3.74 up charge on the same dish I've been ordering here and tons of other locations since forever.  In principle it was weird to me that he was so adamant about what the final price of the dish should be - a dish that I've been ordering with the same substitution for almost 10 years (no chicken, swap for veggies).  No location has ever been short of amazing at delivering this substitution, which is part of why CPK has had my trust.  This disagreement makes me iffy about how I feel dining here again after being a loyal customer who has spent literally thousands of dollars at CPK.  How could I not be surprised by almost $4 added to the base price?  It really disappoints me and not want to come back anymore or bring all of my family here.   So, I'm not sure how to feel - more surprised than anything.  I think they're focusing on the wrong corners to improve in Glendale.  And it really has nothing to do with the Glendale waiters - they have been the best part of this place and should be valued like gold by the company.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60

Drew S.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,14,2,4.0,10/19/2015,"This review is coming from a former CPK employee. I came to this location with my daughter for lunch on my day off from work and was immediately greeted by a friendly host, I liked how she greeted with a smile, asked how we were doing and acknowledge my little 3 year old. On a side note as we were about to get seated another employee smiled and said have a good lunch, so A* for friendly staff. After being seated we were immediately attended by 2 servers, Jed and his trainee Mike who both displayed great restaurant hospitality. Jed acknowledged my daughter as well and always checked in on us to make sure we were okay.  I mentioned to my servers I was a former employee and Jed and I had mutual co-workers so we had a little conversation about people we knew.  My experience was pleasant, food was excellent, restaurant is clean. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because throughout our dining experience I noticed the host was telling other guests about some sort of CPK promotion, sign up and get a free small plate, which when I overheard wondered why she didn't mention the promotion to me as I would have loved to sign up. Also a group got seated right next to our table and the chef came out personally and brought them a complimentary chips and guacamole. So everyone was getting some sort of special treatment besides my daughter and I.  So I hope all staff improves on consistency if there are promotions and the chefs don't just give out free stuff because it's a table of 4 ladies. Other than that my overall experience was good enough to overlook it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60
Craig M.,"West Puente Valley, CA",69,74,79,5.0,6/14/2015,"The food was great but the service was even better to make for a delightful dining experience, our server Kirsten was one of the best we've had anywhere for a good long while; for starters we ordered something that wasn't on the menu for our appetizer and she made it happen... I was very pleased with that. Our food was served piping hot and she was very attentive to our drinks, she packed all our food for us very nicely and brought the check with her when she brought the food with her; to top all that off she was just very pleasant and courteous. I rarely go over 18% tip but in Kirsten's case it was a no-brainer that she deserved more... she even put a little ""Thank You"" happy face on the check *smiles*. Unfortunately I couldn't upload any pictures when I Checked-in because the cell signal is weak in that tower and I couldn't get Yelp to open the business page completely so if your wondering what we had it was Chips and Salsa (not on menu)..

Louis A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,5,1.0,8/21/2015,"I went here with my brother and this place is very shady to say the least. They act all professional and nice, but most of the time, they just wanted you to buy a lot of food. At the start, the chef brought some chips and guacamole giving it to us since it was our first time. I just ordered water since I was making my brother company.  During the whole meal I noticed the waitress trying to push different entrees, meals, and desserts. At the same time, my brother was simply trying to enjoy a pepperoni pizza. It was irritating to say the least. At the end of the meal, it seems we were charged $5 for the chips and guacamole. Now this is the what got me most upset. Aside from being harassed, they charged us for an entree that we DID NOT order. So if you come in expecting to buy a certain amount, then think again, cause they will charge you for stuff you never asked. On top of it, my brother got ill from the pizza. So I would not recommend this place at all. They are pushy, they prepare what looks like microwave pizza, and just flat out add to the bill at their own discretion. It's a shame too since I tend to dine with family, but this place is definitely off my list and hope the same for anyone else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=100

When I pointed it out, she noticed all of them were dirty then explained that the dishwasher is broken. Does that mean they are recycling dirty dishes? The drinks were brought to us flat. Apparently, the soda fountain machine is out of carbonation. When I pointed it out, the waitress seemed to be annoyed that we asked for carbonated soda. WTH? Okay, so back to the small plate. Waitress forgot to bring them to us so I had to remind her. The plates just seemed like the same plates that were wiped down with a damp cloth. The problem, still dirty! Not sure if I'm going to eat the entree I ordered. Yelp would let me update so editing... Nope, didn't stay for the entree. Got so fed up, finally gave in and shared a few words with the manager. As he was listening to our horrible experience, the waitress finally brought our food and tried to push my friend in order to get it on the table. I just couldn't stomach the thought of eating the food off of such dirty plates and returned our entrees. I offered to pay but the manager insisted on comping our bill.

Attentive greeters, waiters and waitress' are consistent with their business model. The place is always clean and busy. Which leads me to their only flaw...the unusual wait times.

Ara D.,"Glendale, CA",6,56,,1.0,1/3/2016,"Frankly, I'm surprised that CPK is still around. It might have been a novel, upcoming establishment back in the 90s, but now it is just far beyond its prime. I admire some of their creativity in making pizzas with less than typical ingredients, but whatever quality that may have existed is just gone. While the Sicilian pizza I had surely wasn't skimpy on ingredients and was a good size for the price, there was barely any sauce or cheese. It was a dry, bland pizza where I felt like I was merely eating bread with meat toppings. I could've stuck to the bread and olive oil if I wanted a carb heavy dinner. It's not just specific to the Glendale location, but a couple other locations had subpar pizza as well, so it seems like the CPK brand has suffered in general. They still have some decent salads and a couple other items, but the pizza is a fraction of what it used to be. CPK, it's time to call it a day.

This time around it was just right the flavor was all good and nothing was too overbearing.  What we ordered: Avocado bacon egg rolls- OMG this is a must if you love avocado and bacon together. MmmM It is so delicious but also so so bad for you. But I like it what can I say ?? I'm a horrible horrible person.  My friend ate a Greek Pizza and that his favorite thing to order. He said he liked it a lot and boy did it look delicious. Another friend ordered a kung pao chicken one which is noodle with an Asian twist and some chicken in it or for a few dollars more you can add shrimp. But I think the chicken one taste the best. This can sometimes be way too salty but this time it was just right ;) I ordered something new on the menu which was the clams. I'm not expecting it to be a great place to get seafood but I have been craving it a lot so I ordered it. The sauce was this light tomato sauce which was great for me.

The bbq chicken salad is really great compared to there garden salad. I highly suggest the bbq chicken salad.

Good items such as Singapour Rolls do not exist anymore. Plus, even the menu itself was laminated or inside a kind of a leather cover before, now it's just a piece of printed carton...so cheap looking. They do not give butter for the appetizer bread like they did before, now (and only upon request) they give you small pieces of butter that they cut and bring from the kitchen ingredients from cooks....really? Portions are kind of smaller than before even tough they say that it's the same amount because it's measured by ounces, but I really don't buy that. Prices are ok for what they give, but it could be better, like before. I guess all this economy thing affected the chain that bad too, but to that point? I think people would be able to pay a little bit extra for what it should be. Service is ok, not the best service but just ok. I had dinner in a not busy evening, very few people and still i had to call my waiter couple time to ask them for water refills and stuff, they should be on top of that without requesting, now that i think about it I should have not tipped him that much since he didn't deserve it but whatever.

The couple was running in and out of the restaurant and there was a lot of commotion happening. The waiter was really trying to do his best to accommodate whatever was going on (canceling orders, reordering orders, etc.).  Total. Shitshow. Basically the guy in the relationship ends up freaking out and throws one of the drink glasses shattering it EVERYWHERE! (Including on us). I rushed up to help the girl immediately after he left, but NO ONE from the restaurant came over to help?!? I stood there glaring at servers who were just standing around gawking at the scene...it took me flagging someone down to ask for management to come help clean up the shards of glass everywhere. Eventually the manager made her way around the tables checking up on everyone. She gave us a free dessert for helping out, which was definitely appreciated (and an appropriate response on her part).

For me and my friends, this always has been the pre-game fueling station, since they close at 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. So long as no one goes in expecting  fungiform papillae fornication, we're good, because California Pizza Kitchen gets you the necessary starch components of the food pyramid which assist with optimum alcohol absorption.  This effect is time-released and synchronizes with several menu items, notably the Tuscan Hummus (perfect for Jagermeister fender-bender prevention), the Split Pea and Barley Soup paired with Spring Rolls (robust combination, defends against premature ralphing and provides evidence of unfortunate occurence in sink the next day, with literal ""puke green"" chunxxx and sliced carrot and lentil overtones) and finally the trademark BBQ Chicken Pizza (the original tag-team of essential oils and cheese, providing poultry protein for longevity and wood-fired shielding against random police checkpoints).  They also have new menu items that I'm looking forward to try; the last item I sampled was the Chipotle chicken pizza was surprisingly good in its simplicity; pico sauce blend with avocado drizzle doesn't take away from the roasted chicken and is in fact one of the ""lighter"" combinations on the pizza list.  Like with any chain, quality varies location to location. I'm thankful that, despite the ever-changing roster of restaurants in this plaza, CPK has maintained.

I'm referring to your ""new"" hand tossed pizza dough and the white pizza. In the past, I used to get the honey wheat crust which was soft and delicious. Now the new wheat dough is flat, dry and tough. And the huge clusters of garlic? No.Thank.You.  The worst offense however, was taking away the delicious globs of that soft white cheese (ricotta?). That was what made this pizza stellar. Now, it's just a thin, dry, barely cheesed ""pizza."" And it's not good. Our waiter said he's been getting complaints about some of the tweaks to other CPK classic dishes, so I know it's not just me.

The think, chunky slices of chicken can just as easily be picked off and eaten without the pizza. Service is generally pretty good at this location - refills plentiful, reminder to validate parking, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=180

Ah, good thing you asked.  In the many times I have been here, I have seen some good dates and some terrible ones.  Today for example there was this couple, and it just wasn't working.  She was so nervous, she kept eating all the food, and then she would complain about how fat she was, poor guy couldn't get a word in edge-wise.  They did however both agree how great their pizza was and it, quote ""reminded her of Italy."" Now I have been to Italy, and I don't know how close it comes to it, but when I come to CPK, I enjoy ordering the BBQ chicken pizza, but lately, ever since the small bites menu has come out, I am all about the Asparagus Arugula salad, and the small bites chicken quesadilla.  It fills me up completely, is fresh, delicious, and it costs around $10 total.  The service is always friendly, and I always have an overall good experience.  I do however no longer feel comfortable at the bar, because every time I go, some old guy hits on me, so I just get a table now.  Hope this covers all aspects of your questions about CPK Glendale!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=180

For us people who are watching their diet, they provide an alternative for pastas replaced with multigrain, and for pizza; it can be replaced with whole wheat flour.

I fell in LOVE with their FOOD & the nice friendly people that work there! So I then had my High School Graduation party here in July of 1999. Then following.. I had my 21st, 22nd, & 26th Birthday lunch party's here! My sister Cindy liked it so much as well, that she had her college graduation party here! All at the CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN in GLENDALE.  Yes, I have been to the CPK in Burbank & Hollywood & West Hollywood & Valencia & other locations yes! But let me tell you WHY I like THIS one the BEST out of them all. It is because.. #1 the atmosphere! I like it how it is up on the top floor & the walls are all glass! I like the water fountain outside the window! The atmosphere is nice & fun! &.. #2 the extremely VERY friendly NICE fun people that work there! (waiters & managers) Their food is YUMMY & their service is GREAT!!!!

I tried the Moroccan something salad, I don't remember seeing this on the menu before, maybe I just never paid attention, but it wasn't all that great.  The combination of the fruit inside the salad was not so good.   We also got a chicken dish which the portions came out huge but the chicken was kind of on the tougher chewier side.   I just don't know if I'd return, based on my experience.  I think much like the Mann Exchange across the street, there are certain businesses in Glendale that were all the rage in the 90's and are faltering now.

Rizzy V.,"Glendale, CA",250,8,12,4.0,3/26/2012,"I felt compelled to write a review for this place following tonight's meal because the experience was just that memorable enough for me.  We were a party of 6 adults with 3 children all 5 years and under, yet we were seated promptly. You would expect it to be packed on a Saturday night, but for some reason--maybe the Olive Garden downstairs took more of their customers this evening, who knows--we got lucky. I like that this location sits on the second floor because they have panoramic windows that wrap around the building so you have the view of downtown Glendale. It makes for a very picturesque background instead of just plain old walls. Really nice, especially if you're out on a date. ;)  We didn't wait too long for our server, who's name was Del. And what I've noticed about most members' experiences, it really all depends on who your server is for that night. Let me tell you, ours was awesome! I have absolutely nothing bad to say about him. If I could rate this based on service and quality of food alone, I would have given it five stars, BUT, I can't be too generous just yet. First things first, Del got our drink orders and let us know that if we wanted to add appetizers he'd be happy to wait for us to make our decisions. And with a group, it's almost guaranteed that this process takes a while. He was really patient and very friendly, always quick with the 'You got it!' or 'Don't worry, I got you' that really sets the tone of the whole restaurant, one that is upbeat and positive.  My two children ordered a small cheese pizza off of the children's menu, which they shared. And two slices is just right for little ones who don't eat very much so that was good. Some of my friends ended up with a variety of pizzas, pasta dishes, and salads. Del brought out this habanero salsa to add to the salads that significantly amped the flavor. We loved it! It definitely made a difference! I ordered the chicken tequila lime fettucine. It was a toss-up between that and the asparagus and spinach spaghettini, which I told him I was planning to get. He suggested the first, so I got that. Our drinks came right away, I love the different types of teas you can choose from. Mine was a mango iced-tea, really delicious and refreshing! And they have free refills! One of my friends ordered tea and later when she asked for more hot water, he gave her an extra bag! How nice is that?! Before our food arrived, we got bread and butter on the house while we waited for our order.  Strike 1: Okay, now this is partly the reason for the missing star. I mean, what happened to their bread?  It tasted like old bread crumbs. Not even dipping it in the vinegar and olive oil or slapping butter on it helped. Not the kind of quality bread I've been accustomed to when I've eaten at CPK in the past. Good thing our food came out right away. My chicken tequila lime fettucine was ALL THAT. I don't think they could have improved it in any way...okay, after I added another wedge of lemon zest to it did it taste complete, but it was perfect! I ate EVERY. BITE. I seriously didn't leave anything on the plate. :) I was really glad I went with that order.   Strike 2: If I had gone with order option #2 and wanted to add chicken, it would have been $4.00 extra, or sauteed mushrooms, would have been $1.00  REALLY? A dollar extra for some shrooms?? Get outta here! So what might have been an $11.00 meal could have easily turned into $16.00. Geez. They're lucky they had fantastic service, not to mention our group is the 'hearty' type with lots of conversations, laughter and a young toddler just beginning to learn table manners, leaving a garden of uneaten food underneath the table. We left that place a mess! Thanks for your patience CPK! Our bill came out to a total of $130ish..not bad for all the stuff we ate and drank!   Keep up the good work and give that server, Del a raise, he's got awesome serving and people skills!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=200

Completely shocked and disgusted, we told our waitress, who in turn told the manager.

The waitress came by to ask about dessert. We refused again and were given the bill. I don't want to sound greedy but we were surprised that the entire bill wasn't comped.

I even licked the spoon.  3 Miso salad with crab and shrimp - super fresh and i loved the variety of napa cabbage, edamame, green onion, avocado, and the crab and shrimp. Not enough of the miso dressing but I got more later. Yay for weird salads. 4 ""The works"" pizza with bacon added - yum. I prefer BBQ chicken but this one was good too.

He came and checked on us, got us refills, and tried to chit-chat but I was too busy eating.  At the end the bill with all of the above as about 20 per person with a 8 dollar tip.

I told him no your salad taste like it was yesterdays salad..then he said you shouldnt eat it if it taste like shit. i told him u dumass if i told u that..you would probably give me extra sauce..he asked me if i wanted something else..i decline. i told him his GLENDALE CPK sucks and I normally eat at Burbank.. he said he came from there..I asked him if he got demoted.. anyways. so i ended up with the chicken garlic linguine it was ok..dam did the portions here get smaller.. i shoulda told that fuckr to supersize it..

Basically, if they give this challenge, you are given a chance to order something from their menu that you've been wanting to try, and if somehow you don't like it,  they will fit the bill, and give you, your original order.  They will not charge you for trying something you didn't like. So when he gave me the CPK CHALLENGE, I went ahead and ordered the THAI PIZZA, and sure enough I didn't like it.

That is nice because you can always count on going to CPK and having a decent meal. I'm not going to waste time talking about the food, because like i said it is decent and doesn't change location to location.  Usually I come here to pickup lunches for my department (more on that latter). Sometimes though I come here though for my own lunch. The service is really hit or miss, and usually is miss. On my last time here for lunch our waitress forgot our waters after we asked her twice. On the second time she only brought one back. My ice tea was never refilled (nor was there an offer to refill it). She also spaced on my pizza dough rewards points and brought us the full check after I told her I had the rewards and gave  her my rewards number. Pretty typical experience for me when I go for my own lunch.  The takeout process usually is much better. Usually when I go to pickup an order I deal with Sarah. Sarah is my CPK hero. I go often enough that she knows me by name and already has entered my pizza dough number for me. She is just that awesome. I can also count on her to have my order ready to go with little to no waiting time. She makes the CPK experience really great. That being said when she isn't there the takeout process is a mess. For example I went to pickup a small order the other day and she wasn't there. The order was to be ready at 11:18. There were three, that is right THREE, people working the takeout counter.

Drinks were on point, appetizers were good too..but I was soooo distracted by the domestic violence (basically) situation happening in the booth next to us. The couple was running in and out of the restaurant and there was a lot of commotion happening. The waiter was really trying to do his best to accommodate whatever was going on (canceling orders, reordering orders, etc.).  Total. Shitshow. Basically the guy in the relationship ends up freaking out and throws one of the drink glasses shattering it EVERYWHERE! (Including on us). I rushed up to help the girl immediately after he left, but NO ONE from the restaurant came over to help?!? I stood there glaring at servers who were just standing around gawking at the scene...it took me flagging someone down to ask for management to come help clean up the shards of glass everywhere. Eventually the manager made her way around the tables checking up on everyone. She gave us a free dessert for helping out, which was definitely appreciated (and an appropriate response on her part). It just baffled me that no one responded immediately to glass shattering all over the place when there is food being consumed in the area?!?!?!

My go to meal here is the quinoa and arugula salad with salmon. The half order is plenty a serving and I usually only eat half of it and pack the rest.  Their lettuce wraps are fresh and so tasty too and the market soup I think it's called is great.  The service is very attentive and the servers hustle.

I realized that they had changed their menu (which is a good thing).. but they took off their 'Lite Adventures' category which was what I would mainly order off of. They have other healthy choices, but it was nice to have the lighter sides grouped together just for our convenience. Waiters are not consistent AT ALL.

This particular location has a grand view of Central Ave. Nothing better than having an excellent view, on a beautiful Sunday afternoon as you enjoy your delicious meal. As soon as we entered, the receptionist at the front greeted us with a gorgeous smile. What a way to enter a restaurant, to be welcomed, and feel like you're welcomed. As soon as we were seated, we were greeted by our server Frank. Frank was excellent! Period. This is a guy that enjoys his work. Very lively, fun, and playful, and of course professional. For refreshments we ordered: Coffee, Strawberry Lemonade, and Water. For appetizer, we ordered: SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP. For Main Course, we ordered: She ordered: BOLOGNESE SPAGHETTI (it was actually pretty darn tasty!) Yours truly ordered: THE ORIGINAL BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA w/Applewood Smoked Bacon, and Fresh Pineapple. (My ultimate favorite! I keep coming back to CPK, JUST. FOR. THIS! In conclusion, we always have a positive experience here. Special positive mention is our server Frank. He made our experience here very fun. When I was torn between ordering Thai Pizza, and BBQ Chicken Pizza. He gave me the CPK CHALLENGE! Basically, if they give this challenge, you are given a chance to order something from their menu that you've been wanting to try, and if somehow you don't like it,  they will fit the bill, and give you, your original order.  They will not charge you for trying something you didn't like. So when he gave me the CPK CHALLENGE, I went ahead and ordered the THAI PIZZA, and sure enough I didn't like it. So he gave me my original order.  At no extra charge. Excellent! So when you're there make sure to ask for Frank.

A sling to safely place an infant car seat 4. Food for kids CPK scores 4/4 based on the criteria listed above. However, the condition of their women's restroom really needs help.

That is nice because you can always count on going to CPK and having a decent meal. I'm not going to waste time talking about the food, because like i said it is decent and doesn't change location to location.  Usually I come here to pickup lunches for my department (more on that latter). Sometimes though I come here though for my own lunch. The service is really hit or miss, and usually is miss. On my last time here for lunch our waitress forgot our waters after we asked her twice. On the second time she only brought one back. My ice tea was never refilled (nor was there an offer to refill it). She also spaced on my pizza dough rewards points and brought us the full check after I told her I had the rewards and gave  her my rewards number. Pretty typical experience for me when I go for my own lunch.  The takeout process usually is much better. Usually when I go to pickup an order I deal with Sarah. Sarah is my CPK hero. I go often enough that she knows me by name and already has entered my pizza dough number for me. She is just that awesome. I can also count on her to have my order ready to go with little to no waiting time. She makes the CPK experience really great. That being said when she isn't there the takeout process is a mess. For example I went to pickup a small order the other day and she wasn't there. The order was to be ready at 11:18. There were three, that is right THREE, people working the takeout counter. My order wasn't ready till 11:35... The woman who gave me my order also forgot my receipt and my pizza dough number. Where was Sarah when I needed her!

The driver's other drop off was in the opposite direction and quite a bit farther than I live to CPK (less than 2 miles).

This is a beautiful location as it is right near these gorgeous apartments and a fountain with lush greenery surrounding it. It is walking distance from the Americana on Brand and is on the second level.  My boyfriend and I had dinner here the other night. As you walk into CPK, you are (occasionally) greeted by the host or hostess. When we got our booth, our server came to greet us and asked us right away if we would like anything to drink. We got two iced waters w/ lemon and extra lemons on the side. He forgot our extra lemons. We then ordered Bread w/ Olive Oil. That was very tasty and addicting! Couldn't stop reaching for more!  For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered Chicken Tequila Fettuccini. He orders it every time and loves it! I ordered the Hand Tossed Margarita Pizza. It was okay. Just okay. The dough wasn't crispy enough it just tasted very chewy and difficult to cut through with a fork and knife. The toppings were good though.  Our waiter was nice, not excellent nor terrible. Just average.

Priya G.,"Glendale, United States",492,247,236,3.0,2/1/2015,"CPK is a chain restaurant that has a variety of Italian food - pizzas, pastas, etc. It's never my first choice as the food is only slightly above average. Anyway, we had a large group of people visiting so we ordered CPK for everyone. My friend and I went to pick up the order ($70+) and when we got home, we realized that one of the main dishes (chicken pasta) was missing. UGH. Also, when we went to pick up the food, the gal told us that she didn't have anymore bread (it's complimentary so whatever). Upon arriving home and realizing the missing pasta, I called CPK. They put the manager on the phone (a young charming guy from Austin) and he changed my experience completely. He took off THREE dishes from our bill (cut our bill in half) and was so nice to us when we came back! UPDATE (June 2015): I came back here today after having a positive experience over the weekend at the Burbank CPK. I was disappointed, yet again. I ordered a chipotle chicken pizza with no chicken (it was recommended to us by the Burbank CPK and was delicious). I placed my order for take out. Upon getting home, I noticed a large piece of chicken on one slice of pizza and then after a careful examination, noticed that there were SMALL pieces of chicken on other slices as well! UGH. So frustrating since I noticed this after arriving home. I had checked the box quickly at CPK but the chicken was not noticeable until I was in bright light. I called the CPK and spoke with Ismael who was the manager on duty. He refunded the charge and sent me a gift card in the mail to come back. I will go back with my husband and eat in person there since our issues always seem to be with take-out.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=20

Attentive greeters, waiters and waitress' are consistent with their business model. The place is always clean and busy. Which leads me to their only flaw...the unusual wait times.

Ara D.,"Glendale, United States",6,56,,1.0,3/1/2016,"Frankly, I'm surprised that CPK is still around. It might have been a novel, upcoming establishment back in the 90s, but now it is just far beyond its prime. I admire some of their creativity in making pizzas with less than typical ingredients, but whatever quality that may have existed is just gone. While the Sicilian pizza I had surely wasn't skimpy on ingredients and was a good size for the price, there was barely any sauce or cheese. It was a dry, bland pizza where I felt like I was merely eating bread with meat toppings. I could've stuck to the bread and olive oil if I wanted a carb heavy dinner. It's not just specific to the Glendale location, but a couple other locations had subpar pizza as well, so it seems like the CPK brand has suffered in general. They still have some decent salads and a couple other items, but the pizza is a fraction of what it used to be. CPK, it's time to call it a day.

I like CPK a lot but I feel that sometimes it can go either way. The food might come out well or it might just taste horrible and way too saucy.  This time around it was just right the flavor was all good and nothing was too overbearing.  What we ordered: Avocado bacon egg rolls- OMG this is a must if you love avocado and bacon together. MmmM It is so delicious but also so so bad for you. But I like it what can I say ?? I'm a horrible horrible person.  My friend ate a Greek Pizza and that his favorite thing to order. He said he liked it a lot and boy did it look delicious. Another friend ordered a kung pao chicken one which is noodle with an Asian twist and some chicken in it or for a few dollars more you can add shrimp. But I think the chicken one taste the best. This can sometimes be way too salty but this time it was just right ;) I ordered something new on the menu which was the clams. I'm not expecting it to be a great place to get seafood but I have been craving it a lot so I ordered it. The sauce was this light tomato sauce which was great for me. The clams were quite a lot but they were very tiny.  Service was alright I wouldn't say the best and they had a hard time remembering to refill drinks.

They act all professional and nice, but most of the time, they just wanted you to buy a lot of food. At the start, the chef brought some chips and guacamole giving it to us since it was our first time. I just ordered water since I was making my brother company.  During the whole meal I noticed the waitress trying to push different entrees, meals, and desserts. At the same time, my brother was simply trying to enjoy a pepperoni pizza. It was irritating to say the least. At the end of the meal, it seems we were charged $5 for the chips and guacamole. Now this is the what got me most upset. Aside from being harassed, they charged us for an entree that we DID NOT order. So if you come in expecting to buy a certain amount, then think again, cause they will charge you for stuff you never asked. On top of it, my brother got ill from the pizza. So I would not recommend this place at all. They are pushy, they prepare what looks like microwave pizza, and just flat out add to the bill at their own discretion.

Apparently, the soda fountain machine is out of carbonation. When I pointed it out, the waitress seemed to be annoyed that we asked for carbonated soda. WTH? Okay, so back to the small plate. Waitress forgot to bring them to us so I had to remind her. The plates just seemed like the same plates that were wiped down with a damp cloth. The problem, still dirty! Not sure if I'm going to eat the entree I ordered. Yelp would let me update so editing... Nope, didn't stay for the entree. Got so fed up, finally gave in and shared a few words with the manager. As he was listening to our horrible experience, the waitress finally brought our food and tried to push my friend in order to get it on the table.

Cesar G.,"Los Angeles, United States",6,25,1,3.0,10/5/2014,"This place is not was it once used to be. They have been keeping on shrinking the menu so now it has very few items on it. Good items such as Singapour Rolls do not exist anymore. Plus, even the menu itself was laminated or inside a kind of a leather cover before, now it's just a piece of printed carton...so cheap looking. They do not give butter for the appetizer bread like they did before, now (and only upon request) they give you small pieces of butter that they cut and bring from the kitchen ingredients from cooks....really? Portions are kind of smaller than before even tough they say that it's the same amount because it's measured by ounces, but I really don't buy that. Prices are ok for what they give, but it could be better, like before. I guess all this economy thing affected the chain that bad too, but to that point? I think people would be able to pay a little bit extra for what it should be. Service is ok, not the best service but just ok. I had dinner in a not busy evening, very few people and still i had to call my waiter couple time to ask them for water refills and stuff, they should be on top of that without requesting, now that i think about it I should have not tipped him that much since he didn't deserve it but whatever.

I'm referring to your ""new"" hand tossed pizza dough and the white pizza. In the past, I used to get the honey wheat crust which was soft and delicious. Now the new wheat dough is flat, dry and tough. And the huge clusters of garlic? No.Thank.You.  The worst offense however, was taking away the delicious globs of that soft white cheese (ricotta?). That was what made this pizza stellar. Now, it's just a thin, dry, barely cheesed ""pizza."" And it's not good. Our waiter said he's been getting complaints about some of the tweaks to other CPK classic dishes, so I know it's not just me.

Now I have been to Italy, and I don't know how close it comes to it, but when I come to CPK, I enjoy ordering the BBQ chicken pizza, but lately, ever since the small bites menu has come out, I am all about the Asparagus Arugula salad, and the small bites chicken quesadilla.  It fills me up completely, is fresh, delicious, and it costs around $10 total.  The service is always friendly, and I always have an overall good experience.  I do however no longer feel comfortable at the bar, because every time I go, some old guy hits on me, so I just get a table now.  Hope this covers all aspects of your questions about CPK Glendale!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=180

I fell in LOVE with their FOOD & the nice friendly people that work there! So I then had my High School Graduation party here in July of 1999. Then following..

I tried the Moroccan something salad, I don't remember seeing this on the menu before, maybe I just never paid attention, but it wasn't all that great.  The combination of the fruit inside the salad was not so good.   We also got a chicken dish which the portions came out huge but the chicken was kind of on the tougher chewier side.   I just don't know if I'd return, based on my experience.  I think much like the Mann Exchange across the street, there are certain businesses in Glendale that were all the rage in the 90's and are faltering now.

Rizzy V.,"Glendale, United States",250,8,12,4.0,26/3/2012,"I felt compelled to write a review for this place following tonight's meal because the experience was just that memorable enough for me.  We were a party of 6 adults with 3 children all 5 years and under, yet we were seated promptly. You would expect it to be packed on a Saturday night, but for some reason--maybe the Olive Garden downstairs took more of their customers this evening, who knows--we got lucky. I like that this location sits on the second floor because they have panoramic windows that wrap around the building so you have the view of downtown Glendale. It makes for a very picturesque background instead of just plain old walls. Really nice, especially if you're out on a date. ;)  We didn't wait too long for our server, who's name was Del. And what I've noticed about most members' experiences, it really all depends on who your server is for that night. Let me tell you, ours was awesome! I have absolutely nothing bad to say about him. If I could rate this based on service and quality of food alone, I would have given it five stars, BUT, I can't be too generous just yet. First things first, Del got our drink orders and let us know that if we wanted to add appetizers he'd be happy to wait for us to make our decisions. And with a group, it's almost guaranteed that this process takes a while. He was really patient and very friendly, always quick with the 'You got it!' or 'Don't worry, I got you' that really sets the tone of the whole restaurant, one that is upbeat and positive.  My two children ordered a small cheese pizza off of the children's menu, which they shared. And two slices is just right for little ones who don't eat very much so that was good. Some of my friends ended up with a variety of pizzas, pasta dishes, and salads. Del brought out this habanero salsa to add to the salads that significantly amped the flavor. We loved it! It definitely made a difference! I ordered the chicken tequila lime fettucine. It was a toss-up between that and the asparagus and spinach spaghettini, which I told him I was planning to get. He suggested the first, so I got that. Our drinks came right away, I love the different types of teas you can choose from. Mine was a mango iced-tea, really delicious and refreshing! And they have free refills! One of my friends ordered tea and later when she asked for more hot water, he gave her an extra bag! How nice is that?! Before our food arrived, we got bread and butter on the house while we waited for our order.  Strike 1: Okay, now this is partly the reason for the missing star. I mean, what happened to their bread?  It tasted like old bread crumbs. Not even dipping it in the vinegar and olive oil or slapping butter on it helped. Not the kind of quality bread I've been accustomed to when I've eaten at CPK in the past. Good thing our food came out right away. My chicken tequila lime fettucine was ALL THAT. I don't think they could have improved it in any way...okay, after I added another wedge of lemon zest to it did it taste complete, but it was perfect! I ate EVERY. BITE. I seriously didn't leave anything on the plate. :) I was really glad I went with that order.   Strike 2: If I had gone with order option #2 and wanted to add chicken, it would have been $4.00 extra, or sauteed mushrooms, would have been $1.00  REALLY? A dollar extra for some shrooms?? Get outta here! So what might have been an $11.00 meal could have easily turned into $16.00. Geez. They're lucky they had fantastic service, not to mention our group is the 'hearty' type with lots of conversations, laughter and a young toddler just beginning to learn table manners, leaving a garden of uneaten food underneath the table. We left that place a mess! Thanks for your patience CPK! Our bill came out to a total of $130ish..not bad for all the stuff we ate and drank!   Keep up the good work and give that server, Del a raise, he's got awesome serving and people skills!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=200

Service was fine, food tasted the same, but halfway through his meal my husband bit into a hard object that he thought was a black peppercorn. It was actually a small metal screw. Completely shocked and disgusted, we told our waitress, who in turn told the manager. The manager came by to apologize and offered another pizza but we refused, asking for it to be taken off the bill instead. She asked about dessert, which we refused. The waitress came by to ask about dessert. We refused again and were given the bill. I don't want to sound greedy but we were surprised that the entire bill wasn't comped.

So long as no one goes in expecting  fungiform papillae fornication, we're good, because California Pizza Kitchen gets you the necessary starch components of the food pyramid which assist with optimum alcohol absorption.  This effect is time-released and synchronizes with several menu items, notably the Tuscan Hummus (perfect for Jagermeister fender-bender prevention), the Split Pea and Barley Soup paired with Spring Rolls (robust combination, defends against premature ralphing and provides evidence of unfortunate occurence in sink the next day, with literal ""puke green"" chunxxx and sliced carrot and lentil overtones) and finally the trademark BBQ Chicken Pizza (the original tag-team of essential oils and cheese, providing poultry protein for longevity and wood-fired shielding against random police checkpoints).  They also have new menu items that I'm looking forward to try; the last item I sampled was the Chipotle chicken pizza was surprisingly good in its simplicity; pico sauce blend with avocado drizzle doesn't take away from the roasted chicken and is in fact one of the ""lighter"" combinations on the pizza list.  Like with any chain, quality varies location to location. I'm thankful that, despite the ever-changing roster of restaurants in this plaza, CPK has maintained.  KEY GRIP: It's entertaining how seriously some of the ""sommeliers"" here take their jobs; I mean, you're at a pizza place.

Which means I've been here more often than necessary. It's not bad, it's not great. Even though this location gets packed during lunch hours, service is quick enough. Pizzas, pasta, sandwiches, salads all in which are pretty good and reasonably priced. I once went to lunch here with my boss' wife, and she made us switch booths a couple times, rudely asked for water and bread as if she were entitled to it, then kept flagging our waitress down so she could get more ""crispies"" (fried wonton strips) for her salad.

The service was very friendly and attentive. The strawberry shortcake dessert was as close to home made delicious as I've tasted in a restaurant.  I'm still saddened that they took my favorite Tandoori Chicken Pizza off the menu but the Jerk Chicken is an acceptable replacement.    I wish the other CPK's in the Bay Area were this good again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=220

VEGGIES duh... okay.. what is up with this ""salad"" there were NO GREENS at all.. There were a bunch of wontons in it. Talk about putting the CRUNCH in the Thai crunch salad.. but no thank you for a carb overload. when I asked the waiter is this a salad? there is no greens inside..he told me that he was going to make sure what kind of greens are supposed to be in it.. uhm... aren't you already supposed to know? Then he comes out with a little bowl of the napa cabbage and tells me that this is waht is supposed to be in the salad.. I KNOWW!!!!!! Im ASIAN FOR crying out loud! I think I know what Napa Cabbage is... then he expected me to dump the bowl of cabbage into my salad myself... so I told him no.. and he took it back to put more greens in it.. After he did that, the salad just didn't taste the same anymore. Everything was bland.. My mom and I ended up not even touching the salad afterwards. Kung Pao Spaghetti NEGATIVE: Too sweet. Pasta was overcooked. Absolutely HORRIBLE. My idea of this fantastic restaurant just went down the drain after this visit. HORRIBLE experience.

I mean, they charge like $15 for a salad which is the size of CF's or BJ's lunch size salads which cost no more than $8-9. And now, it is almost impossible to find a food item on the menu which is below $10. The thing that gets me is the fact that their food doesn't even taste that great, just average.

Should've gone to the Burbank one. So i get there and right when i get seated there were linguine and pasta, bread crumb shit on my sofa chair and I told the receptionist that theres shit on it so she just said ""ok"". then she cleaned it with her right hand, really..her right hand..put all that shit on the ground and told me to sit. nice.. then i try to put my plate on my side.. it was'nt even placed on my side..there was lots of bread crumbs and pasta stain on it WTF? I told the lady that I didnt order the plate and she took it away. I ordered the mango tea drink. the mango tea tasted like they put i squirt of mango flavor on it and extra splenda.. this drink was horrible..skimpy on the syrup heavy on the splenda..Next I ordered the Chinese chicken salad and the lettuce and carrots were shredded so thinly.. it was also stale and brown..so this Hispanic manager happens to come by and ask if everything was ok. I told him no your salad taste like it was yesterdays salad..then he said you shouldnt eat it if it taste like shit. i told him u dumass if i told u that..you would probably give me extra sauce..he asked me if i wanted something else..i decline. i told him his GLENDALE CPK sucks and I normally eat at Burbank.. he said he came from there..I asked him if he got demoted.. anyways. so i ended up with the chicken garlic linguine it was ok..dam did the portions here get smaller.. i shoulda told that fuckr to supersize it.. Oh yea they keep the place really DARK and GLOOMY so you wouldn't find anything crawling in your food..

Today, whenever I go to CPK, I hope to be transported back to those halcyon days of high school where eating chicken tequila fettucine and bullshitting with friends seemed like the pinnacle of social achievement. Instead, I am left disappointed that the food isn't as good as it is in my memories. Not sure if it's because I'm older or if the quality has gone down.

There are many favorites on the menu but my review here is for the Glendale location. I love their ""penthouse"" location and view down onto Brand Blvd. There's a delightful, open feel to this establishment. They're pretty hard to come by these days.  Had lunch here last weekend. The two of us shared a full salad (BBQ chicken ranch for almost $15) and a wild mushroom pizza (about $14). The price of the food has really gone up over the years. I still remember the days of $9.95 pizzas here. My usual beverage is the strawberry iced tea. They were nice to accommodate our request for an iced coffee. They don't have it on the menu but they made one for us anyway.  I'm not crazy about their complimentary baguette. It has a raw taste to it. The herbed dipping oil is delicious though.  More than half the salad and two slices of pizza were left over from our lunch. Service was great on a busy Saturday lunch service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60
Maureen M.,"Los Angeles, United States",164,33,656,5.0,9/12/2014,"The staff is attentive. The hostess greets warmly upon entering and asks if any parking validations are needed. I feel this is important as many people forget their parking ticket in the car or purposely leave it as to not lose it.  The waitress we had was very pleasant and energetic which is always a plus. Who likes a drabby waitress right? We asked for a suggestion on a pizza to share and she advised of 3 she likes. We chose the Califonia Club, which surprised with the freshness and crunchiness of the iceberg lettuce and the bacon. The avocado slices on top are a good finishing touch.  The base of the pizza has very little if any marinara. It did have chicken bits and you can add Parmesan cheese at your discretion. I see it as a salad on a pizza... Thin crispy crust of course. I had a yummy small plate arugula salad previous to the pizza and it didn't disappoint at a $5 price. It's comparable to any high end restaurant, to it's shaved Parmesan topping.  We had two slices each and two to go! Great lunch experience.

I'm sorry, this is a very poorly managed CPK if they don't have enough waiters on a Saturday night. Rather than wait 15 minutes we decided to sit at the bar for dinner.  The bartender was nice, but clearly overworked and frazzled.  It took him soo long to bring my husband his wine that he finally canceled the wine order when he was close to finishing his dinner.

We were still kind of in the bar area so the lady working behind the bar was our waitress.  I ordered the Thai and Baja Tortilla Spring Rolls, then a Works pizza and my son had the cheese pizza.  I told her to just put all of the orders in and bring it all as soon as it was ready, not wanting the appetizer to stretch the meal time overly long. I had iced tea and he had water.  The appetizer was okay, my son didn't like it (which is really unusual) and the pizza was really thin and kinda soggy on the bottom and not much cheese.  Price tag with tip -$55.   Way overpriced food and okay service, but the entire experience took nearly 2 hours, which is too long.  I think I'm done with CPK now.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60

Even when he returned my change he basically tossed it back on the counter to me. In a lot of cultures I think that's considered disrespectful and rude. But the reason why I gave 5 stars was because of the manager with the hair combed back and earrings. He was extremely helpful and polite at all times. He was hard and fast working jumping around everywhere to make sure everything was going perfect. He was working under a lot of pressure and it didn't phase him. As a business owner myself it's extremely hard to find a manager as great as him. Cpk should give him a raise in my opinion.

Amanda N.,"Glendale, United States",0,25,,2.0,29/5/2016,"The waiters at CPK are what makes this location great, so friendly and professional.  If this was a review just for them, it would be ten stars.  I'm sure I've met all of them here.  So thank you to them for always making it a great experience, and they still do.  The waiter on this particular night was stellar. I think this location as a whole is very confused about what they're actually needing to improve, so much that they got a new manager who was literally going back and forth with me over a $3.74 up charge on the same dish I've been ordering here and tons of other locations since forever.  In principle it was weird to me that he was so adamant about what the final price of the dish should be - a dish that I've been ordering with the same substitution for almost 10 years (no chicken, swap for veggies).  No location has ever been short of amazing at delivering this substitution, which is part of why CPK has had my trust.  This disagreement makes me iffy about how I feel dining here again after being a loyal customer who has spent literally thousands of dollars at CPK.  How could I not be surprised by almost $4 added to the base price?  It really disappoints me and not want to come back anymore or bring all of my family here.   So, I'm not sure how to feel - more surprised than anything.  I think they're focusing on the wrong corners to improve in Glendale.  And it really has nothing to do with the Glendale waiters - they have been the best part of this place and should be valued like gold by the company.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-glendale?start=60

Drew S.,"Los Angeles, United States",84,14,2,4.0,19/10/2015,"This review is coming from a former CPK employee. I came to this location with my daughter for lunch on my day off from work and was immediately greeted by a friendly host, I liked how she greeted with a smile, asked how we were doing and acknowledge my little 3 year old. On a side note as we were about to get seated another employee smiled and said have a good lunch, so A* for friendly staff. After being seated we were immediately attended by 2 servers, Jed and his trainee Mike who both displayed great restaurant hospitality. Jed acknowledged my daughter as well and always checked in on us to make sure we were okay.  I mentioned to my servers I was a former employee and Jed and I had mutual co-workers so we had a little conversation about people we knew.  My experience was pleasant, food was excellent, restaurant is clean. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because throughout our dining experience I noticed the host was telling other guests about some sort of CPK promotion, sign up and get a free small plate, which when I overheard wondered why she didn't mention the promotion to me as I would have loved to sign up. Also a group got seated right next to our table and the chef came out personally and brought them a complimentary chips and guacamole. So everyone was getting some sort of special treatment besides my daughter and I.  So I hope all staff improves on consistency if there are promotions and the chefs don't just give out free stuff because it's a table of 4 ladies.
