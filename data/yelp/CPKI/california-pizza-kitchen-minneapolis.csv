Joy H.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,35,,4.0,6/26/2009,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK to frequent diners) has added a colorful new salad to the already great selection of salads on its menu. A friend and I have lunch at the Southdale location every week, so I'm more than familiar with the menu and the variety of fresh and flavorful veggie offerings keeps me coming back. Also, CPK dedicates a page on its website to vegetarianism with a list of menu items that are appropriate for different veggie diets. The new Moroccan salad is composed of many wonderful things - lightly-spiced roasted butternut squash, beets, Medjool dates, avocado, toasted almonds, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell pepper tossed with romaine and champagne vinaigrette. (You can hold the chicken and the egg.) The flavor and color is sort of autumnal for mid-summer, but it's currently one of my favorite salads anywhere. For most of CPK's salads, half is $9.49; full is $12.99. The half-size is plenty for a lunch entrée. The Thai crunch salad has a spicy kick to it and some great veggie protein with peanuts and edamame, along with shredded Napa and red cabbage, tortilla strips, cucumbers, wontons, carrots and green onion tossed with a lime-cilantro dressing and topped with crispy rice sticks and Thai peanut dressing. I recommend holding the chicken and tortilla strips, and adding avocado. Another nice option is the grilled vegetable salad with grilled asparagus, Japanese eggplant, zucchini, green onions and roasted corn, served warm over a bed of chilled romaine, with fresh avocado and sun-dried tomatoes in Dijon balsamic vinaigrette. The warm veggies are a nice contrast to the cool, crisp lettuce. The Tuscan hummus appetizer ($6.49) is really smooth and garlicky, topped with chopped tomatoes and basil, and served with warm, slightly sweet pita bread. It's so good, it's habit-forming. The Dakota smashed pea and barley soup ($3.99 cup/$5.99 bowl) is vegan and if you're a fan of pea soup, this one's delicious. They offer a veggie sandwich with grilled Portobello mushrooms, red and yellow peppers, baby field greens and sliced Roma tomatoes with melted Fontina and Mozzarella cheeses and sun-dried tomato aioli on focaccia. (You can hold the cheese and the aioli.) It's served with choice of soup, Caesar salad, spicy Szechuan slaw, or vegans can substitute the house salad. ($9.99) CPK's Mediterranean salad was removed from the menu to make way for the Moroccan, but I'm hoping it returns at some point - they top the wonderful pita and hummus with a salad of romaine, Greek olives, red onion, cucumber and tomato in lemon-herb vinaigrette (hold the feta cheese and Tzatziki sauce, if you choose.) A server mentioned they have all the ingredients in house and are able to make it by special request. California Pizza Kitchen has three Twin Cities locations: Southdale Center in Edina, Rosedale Mall in Roseville and The Shops at Arbor Lakes in Maple Grove. There's a fourth, if you include the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport location. For more info: ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Bronson M.,"Minneapolis, MN",76,160,100,2.0,5/26/2011,"There was a time many years ago when CPK first opened in Minnesota when I thought that this place made awesome pizzas.  Sadly, through my travels for work and to different pizzerias (see Mesa Pizza) around the Twin Cities I quickly discovered that I was wrong.  My grandma who was visiting from out of town wanted to get something relatively fast and light for lunch.  Since I hadn't been here in a while and because there wasn't a wait I suggested we check it out.   I ordered the Greek pizza which came out COVERED in olives...and when I say covered I mean it was literally half of the toppings on the pizza.  Don't get me wrong, I like olives, but you could probably get the same satisfaction of eating this pizza by sticking your head into the olive bar at Byerly's and going to town.  The pizza itself was OK at best and would have been forgettable if it weren't for the obscene olive party going on.  My grams liked her mushroom pizza which counts for something I suppose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Angie S.,"Minneapolis, MN",140,158,65,2.0,7/27/2011,"I don't know why we expect different results every time.  The food here is good (we usually get the same thing and the pizza is delicious and the avacado egg rolls are a must) but over all the experience is disappointing.   We can been her a couple times and sometimes I feel like the servers reset the system and forget about us.  We wait to get our orders in, again to wait on our food, and then when we are done the bill takes longer than average time to get to us.  By the time we get the bill we just have them run it right away because we probably are late for our movie.  Sometimes I feel like this is a glorified TGI Fridays... unless you have time - I would order for pick up or go when your schedule is free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Rachel K.,"St Paul, MN",39,86,2,3.0,8/21/2011,"I went with my friends here for the first time as they had won a gift certificate from their work. We were seated promptly and told that they had no alcohol options tonight for drinks. It wasn't until later in the meal that we overheard the waitress tell another table that they didn't have their liquor license since the ownership had recently changed. I think they should tell people that was the reason for the no alcohol as we spent the most our meal thinking that they served someone underage.  We order 3 orders of the spring rolls, the Baja and Thai. Both were good, but the Thai spring rolls were better than the baja. The sauce for the Thai rolls was phenomenal. We ordered the White Pizza with bacon and also the Habenero Chicken Pizza. The Habenero pizza was good and actually had a decent amount of heat, it was not ""Minnesota Spicy"" but rather made your mouth tingle from the heat. The White pizza was very good, I feel the bacon really made the pizza, but be advised it is an extra charge.  We each got desserts, I mean why not, we had a $50 gift card. The apple crisp was good according to my friend and her husband enjoyed the tiramisu. I had the Red Velvet Cake and was in heaven.  Overall, our meal was good, but this place is just way too overpriced to earn more than 3 stars. Even with our gift card, we ended up having to pay $25 above the gift card. Another thing that caused a lower rating, when presented with the gift card and the debit card by my friend, our waitress asked if we wanted to use the gift card before the debit card. Why would we not want the gift card used first? Common sense people, use it.  I will not be back unless I have a gift card to use or win the lottery so I can afford my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Michael M.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,33,78,5.0,8/6/2012,"It appears this store has closed - was at Southdale on August 4, 2012 and the store was completely closed, windows covered and now signs about why it closed - assuming it was due to the remodeling of Southdale but who knows.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Micki C.,"Hopkins, MN",83,198,25,3.0,3/21/2010,"California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) is a great place to hit up with the family before or after your movie at AMC Southdale Theaters.  They don't take reservations, but the wait usually moves pretty quickly.   They have some great pizza options if you want to get fancier than the traditional cheese and pepperoni--think Punch Pizza--I recommend the goat cheese with roasted red peppers or the white pizza.  They also have a wide variety of salads and pastas.  I found it easy to find a healthy menu option--the mahi tacos were tasty. Seems the consensus is the food is overpriced.  If you want to eat for less than $10, then perhaps a fast food restaurant is the place to go.  I didn't find these prices to be any more expensive than Punch Pizza (for a similar food quality and comparison), and it is certainly in the same ball park if not slightly cheaper than Cheesecake Factory or PF Chang (also located in the mall).  Plus the atmosphere and menu is kid friendly.    ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Sarah L.,"Minneapolis, MN",30,154,42,3.0,2/5/2009,"I am in agreement with the rest as far as cost.  It does get pretty spendy in there just for a couple of people having dinner.  And that is why I stick with just the appetizer part of the menu.  Once in a great while we will get a craving for the lettuce wraps.  Which is under $10.  And after that, we are good to go.  From what I remember of their pizzas, I didn't think they were that bad.  I think they had a bbq chicken pizza there that I thought was pretty good.   The place is always packed with waiting lines during the weekend, so if you want to avoid all that, don't go during the weekends, duh ; ) Great place for groups of people, it's ususally hectic and loud in there, so bring the kids, why not!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Norton L.,"Shoreview, MN",19,128,25,1.0,12/11/2008,"I'm in total agreement with Stephanie C.  This place is NOT worth it.  I was at lunch there with some old colleagues I hadn't seen in 10 years.  The company was great.  The food was not. Everything on the menu was $10 or more and all of it was meant for one person.  So I would have paid $12 for a pizza that wasn't enough to share.  Well, ok.  My friend ordered one and it looked like it was big enough for one person to be full and another to have a piece or two.   I got away with only spending $8.50 (not including tip) because I ordered off the lunch menu.  It was a California Chicken Club Sandwich that was almost like carbon monoxide: colorless, odorless, and tasteless.  Just not deadly.  Fortunately, I had good conversation that distracted me from the food enough that it wasn't til I left that I realized I had just eaten something that tasted like styrofoam with the texture of Tempurpedic pillow (not that I've ever eaten a Tempurpedic pillow, but it probably would have had more taste). The amazing thing was that the place was decently full for lunch.  Given that this particular store was in Edina, it probably reflected the affluence of the crowd. Considering the food and the cost, I'd almost would rather have gone to Arby's.  Almost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Ian Y.,"Hartford, CT",183,363,156,2.0,10/9/2011,"I don't understand why people rave about this place because CPK's pizza is extremely mediocre.  Yet, the prices are high and the portions are small.  The pizza that I ordered came cold too.  Service there was nothing special either.  Skip the CPK chain and opt for a real pizzeria.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Mike G.,"Minneapolis, MN",54,54,,3.0,3/6/2009,"Well, its nothing sexy, but it is a decent place for a quick bite before catching a movie at the Southdale AMC Theater.  Sitting at the bar helps speed things up if you are pressed for time.  You can also  get a pizza ""To Go"" and bring into the movie! The food is OK, and may be a little spendy considering what you get.  Atmosphere is pretty typical for a mall type sit-down restaurant.  It is pretty good people watching along the windows, if watching Edina teens is interesting.... Ruby Tuesday is a Sports Bar type alternative near the Movie Theater, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Emily S.,"Minneapolis, MN",69,452,62,2.0,3/20/2009,"I don't mind this place, I really enjoy the bruschetta appetizer, but I DO feel that the prices are too high. I would just prefer to spend my money on one of the CPK pizzas from the store. They do have peach lemonade, I do like that, but that's about it. Everything else is just over priced, and tastes semi bad - bad.  Also, it's located in the South dale mall....think about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Jason S.,"Rosemount, MN",4,42,2,3.0,2/13/2010,"For once I had something other than pizza here. I went with the fish tacos, they where good but not $11 good.  They can pretty much get what they want for price because it's Edina, but everything is overpriced. This place needs need to expand on their beer selection on tap. Only three available being Sam Adams, Miller Lite and a seasonal being Leinie's.  I will say the service was great, no issues with that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Ken P.,"Osseo, MN",2,25,,5.0,2/29/2012,Ken P. Maple Grove Ate at the Maple Grove restaurant tonight. Never disappointed. Had the Hawaiian pizza. Yummy.  Desserts are terrific.  Nice surroundings. Convenient location within Arbor Lakes & walking distance to mega theatres.  Huge parking lot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Sarah G.,"Buffalo, NY",57,210,75,3.0,5/9/2009,"I've never been to a CPK (or so I remember my mother swears that I ate there in Vegas... I have no memory of it!). Always saw it in the freezer at the local grocery and had te opportunity to try out CPK for my birthday. I had the mushroom pizza and it was delicious. My dining-mate had the chicken, arugula, pear and goat cheese pizza. They have put it back on the menu.  Personally I think that the prices are a bit high being that for $11 you get a personal pizza. Nice location and depending on where you are sitting you don't' see too much mall traffic but the price doesn't make it worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Adam G.,"Minneapolis, MN",19,30,,5.0,9/23/2011,This is a great restaurant. I had the Hawaiian pizza and recommend it although all their pizza choices are good. The crust was mixed with a little sugar and it definitely added to the deliciousness of the pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Kelsey K.,"Grand Marais, MN",54,166,6,3.0,12/26/2010,I don't eat her often but my meal here 2 weeks ago made me decide to write a review. Me and a friend were running super late to grab some food pre movie we were going to be watching at 7pm (I had to work late.). We decided a quick solution would be getting food to go from CPK. It turned out to be a good decision. The staff was super helpful and the food was good. My friend got a pizza with Thai chicken (peanut sauce drizzled on top) and I got a salad with goat cheese. Both were good eats. The pizza was especially good a night later after I came home from another late night of working.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
JOHN M.,"Hopkins, MN",0,4,,3.0,3/27/2011,"Your typical chain pizza location, and a guilty pleasure. It's a great stop to share a bite with someone on the way to the movies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Maureen F.,"Elk River, MN",47,152,3,3.0,3/24/2009,"I remember eating here a lot  when I was in high school and it seemed fancy at the time. Now that I have more refined tastes, I would say this is pretty average mall food, but a little better than fast food. The pizza crust is actually pretty good and it seems a bit healthier than the average greasy slice you would get at the mall. The BBQ chicken salad is actually very tasty, but it is gigantic, so I recomend ordering a half portion. If you want to grab something to eat before a movie, this isn't a bad place but it is a little overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
Krista S.,"Lakeville, MN",8,59,2,5.0,6/11/2012,"i've only been here once, but i think i can say i really enjoyed it and would go back... laid back atmosphere, they serve drinks, service is friendly... the food was good and a more unique menu then i thought they'd have... my food was comparable to cheesecake factory...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-minneapolis
