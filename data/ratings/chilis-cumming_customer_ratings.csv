This restaurant is usually noisy and not very clean. The service is generally good but the food quality varies from fair to poor. My last meal was the Caribbean Salad with shrimp. When it was served, I thought I smelled something bad but took a bite of the shrimp anyway. It was mushy, tasted terrible and had a foul, spoiled seafood odor. It was also undercooked. The kitchen had to know they were serving something inedible but apparently didn't care. I returned the salad and asked for the version with chicken as a replacement. They served the replacement with no comment or apology for the bad food. Also, after serving bad food, most restaurants would have comp'ed the meal to placate the customer but Chili's did not. I will not be back. Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cumming?start=40,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

The chili pepper itself is somewhat absent from the menu, save for iconographical status.  The baby back ribs are delicious, and you will find yourself singing that d*mn song in your head, if not out loud. In fact, you're probably doing it right now. Did you know that Scientists have determined that the Baby Back Ribs Song was the first meme? It quickly spread across America and into neighboring countries. There are documented examples of tribes along the Amazon river, that have had no contact with the outside world, dancing and singing, ""I want my baby back, baby back, baby back, baby back..."" They have no concept of the meaning of their words, but they know the subtle harmony brings good crops and keeps them safe from danger. This is the power of Chili's.  tl;dr - It's a Chili's.

I went to wash my hands and saw two empty tables in the center. Upon my return I asked if we could sit at any of these two open tables, the red headed hostess told me that she did not want to ""kill"" the kitchen.  Questions: 1. Why are we the only party waiting? 2. Why fifteen minutes? 3. Why am I holding this vibrator? So I am i really to believe that a party of five could potentially kill the kitchen crew?

I was greeted by a manager who told me she was too busy with togo orders and so I ordered my app. and drink from him. As I wait for my app. a server comes and asks me if I'm ok and would like to order anything else and I said I would wait until my appetizer arrived. When I got my app not one person came by to ask if I wanted to order or to even ask if everything was ok. At this point I still haven't even seen the bartender or a manager. I was so furious that I got the check and left and lost my appetite. Apparently togo food is more important than your dine in customers. Waste of money and ruined my lunch.

In addition she discovered their was no chocolate mile, so she suggested the cherry Coke instead...really.  Next she took the order. We waited between 35 and 40 minutes for the meal to arrive. The fish tacos were under cooked. The boneless wings were hard and cold. The only things that were good were the man n cheese and the mashed potatoes. Even the French fries were cold.

Tell the server you are ready to order food and they will make you wait more, saying ""I'll be right back to take the rest of your order."" ""Right back"" is a relative term at this location, expect at least a 10 minute wait from there. That equals 25 minutes from sitting to placing order, even if you knew exactly what you wanted when sitting down. We have tested this theory on multiple occasion and we are done.

26,Lena L.,"Cumming, GA",0,3,4.0,1.0,2016-07-22,"One big word: FILTHY. I'm a regular at this location... Unfortunately... I love chili's salsa and tableside guacamole. But this location has been disgusting for its antisanitary conditions. There can be 6 unclean tables in one sitting area at a time. The servers can juggle dirty plates and the food that's coming out in one hand allowing cross contamination. I usually come in by myself, so I have observed a pattern where the servers, seeing that, do not rush to serve me. This has happened on multiple occasions, regardless whether the restaurant is busy or not. Last time was particularly horrible, where I put in the order for food and drinks at the same time (after a 10-minute wait at the table), and the drink arrived 20 minutes later. The tableside guac took even longer (so much for an appetizer). Finally, I ordered the Caribbean salad with grilled shrimp. The 'grilled' shrimp was cold (!). I started eating the salad and noticed a piece of chicken in it (I didn't ask for that bonus), which was either chewed up, having fallen off a dirty plate or another plate from a table that was served simultaneously. I have attached a picture of that here. That was nauseating to say the least, I stopped eating at once and checked out, nobody came to check on me. When the survey popped up on the zyosk screen, I started to type all this, only to end up with the zyosk reloading in the middle of it and going back to the home screen with no option for leaving a survey. I attribute it to the fact that I was next to the server's station, and they could have looked over my shoulder to see what I was doing, and controlled the zyosk from their computer, but I can't be 100% sure of that, I don't know how this stuff works. All I know is that the quality of food leaves much to be desired, I don't even wanna think about the condition of their kitchen, customers get ignored, tables don't get cleaned promptly, while the whole crew wastes time they claim they don't have to come out every time to sing the horrible happy birthday song!

3,Eric L.,"Cumming, GA",48,13,1.0,3.0,2017-06-20,6-19-17 Had the buffalo chicken salad with extra blue cheese crumbles & extra wing sauce. Very good and I would recommend it/order it again. This is the second very good salad I've had here. Next time I would ask for grilled chicken instead of fried simply for health reasons. We also had the chips & salsa appetizer as it was a late lunch and we were very hungry. The chips were very oily and I would not order them again. Our waitress who was also the bartender was good and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cumming,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
9,Shari H.,"Cumming, GA",0,4,,1.0,2017-07-04,"I have had 2 bad experiences at this Chili's, I am DONE!! The first time, we didn't eat the fried pickle appetizer because they were mushy; we told our server & she did not offer to take off the bill. Toward the end of our meal, I asked for a to go box and when she brought it, she took my food away!! When I questioned her she offered to have the kitchen cook 1/2 order for me; I declined because we were rushing to get to a movie. I called the next day to complain to manager, he insisted on sending comp cards, only I never received. The second time (2 weeks ago), we got seated pretty quick but did not get greeted by server for a good 5 minutes. She took our drink order and after another 10 minutes of not seeing her, we got up & left, straight to Cheeseburger Bobbies. I am pretty understanding in certain situations, as I used to serve (5 1/2 years at Chilis many years ago), but these two situations are both ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cumming,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
0,Rob S.,"Cumming, GA",0,32,,5.0,2017-08-12,"It seems my wife and I have been by this location a bijillion times, and finally decided to use our gift card given to us. We went in late afternoon to have an early bird dinner. Our server Shad was at our table quickly, brought cold drinks, and took our order promptly. My wife ordered the big baby back rib platter with 3 choices(baked BBQ chicken breast, Cheese smoked sausage with hot peppers inside, and garlic dill pickles with homefries on the side. I opted for the Bacon burger with all the works and melted cheddar cheese, garlic pickles, homefries etc. It is one of the new speciality platters on the new menu.  All were cooked perfect, delicious and temp hot. My wife's could not finish her platter but I will tell you Chili's knows how to do ribs, cheeseburgers, and salads quite well. If you go to this location, be sure to ask to sit in Shad's section. He will take excellent care of y'all's family and friends. I think he is the senior server. We left with big go cups w/o asking first....but our doggie bags for the later  was much appreciated . Our server was by several times to check in on us.....worth mentioning to those who look for this as we do. Is it nice nice to have a great dining out that was problem-free.....choose this location for a really great meal especially when you're powerful hungry !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cumming,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

8,Allison D.,"Cumming, GA",1,5,2.0,1.0,2017-10-08,"Awful! We were seated quickly but the waitress disappeared. Had to get up to find someone to take our order. Found two managers with arms crossed chit chatting who summoned someone else to take our order. Margarita I ordered was all lime juice and watered down. Our appetizer arrived which was decent until we found an adhesive tab to some type of bag IN OUR FOOD. Again, had to get up to find someone who finally came over and asked if we wanted another one. I said how about an apology? He reluctantly said ""sorry"".... we decided to get up and leave. WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. I noticed their health rating of 88 on the way out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cumming,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
7,Rebecca H.,"Cumming, GA",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-12,"We have visited this particular Chili's many many times over the years. Within, I'd say the last 3-4 years, the food quality has gone WAY WAY down.  We went tonight to celebrate my birthday with my family. We were seated quickly and our drinks were brought out in good time. We ordered an appetizer of chips and salsa. This has been a staple appetizer for us to get for years. The chips tasted old and burned and the salsa was so watery it wouldn't even stay on the chips. The rest of the food was equally as bad. My husband and I shared the fajitas and honestly, I haven't tasted anything that bad in long time. This has been occurring over and over. We should have stuck with ordering soup and a salad. That seems like it would be hard to mess up. Either way. We're done with this Chili's. After going there for as long as its been here, we will never ever go back. EVER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cumming,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

From foul language, to lights going out briefly, to having a tray of dirty plates being dropped by our feet, today had to be an off day. It was just NUTS.  The host greeted us right away and asked if we wanted to sit in the dining room or bar. My son and I opted for the dining area. We were conveniently seated by the kitchen. Cause what 8 year old doesn't love hearing the kitchen shenanigans?! People watch your mouth! This is a business strictly run on customer service! My son (and me) hearing f bombs, etc is unacceptable.  We started with ordering our drinks. Our server appeared overwhelmed and had to come back by to verify our drinks. That's fine, I'd rather her verify than bring the wrong thing. She was polite but just seemed so frantic. Actually, everyone seemed frantic.   After receiving our drinks we were greeted by a new server. He took our order; kid slider burgers with fries and chicken tacos no avocado. He was polite and got our order correct.  Our food arrived in a reasonable timeframe. The presentation was lacking and looked messy. However it tasted fine.  We waited longer than expected for drink refills.  The chips are not as I remember them, thin and crispy cantina style. We were never offered more salsa. We had to ask.  All in all, it was ok. But I expect better service. The game is now $1.99. What happened to 99 cents?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cumming,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
