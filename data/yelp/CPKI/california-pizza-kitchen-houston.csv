Ed D.,"Missouri City, TX",0,13,,1.0,5/21/2016,"I went here about a week ago weekday well past lunch time rush. It was not busy by any means. Ill just with go with pros and cons and not a story, that will be longer.  Pros: they boxed our left overs.  -- food slightly above average. Pizza was partly burnt.  Cons: By far one of the worst service we've had.   --Waitstaff and Bartender saw us and didn't even try to get anyone to sit us.  --we didn't have utensils so we tried to get a waitstaffs attention. He was 10 ft away and didn't even look at us. He in LaLaLand. Blond haired kid.  --I ordered ice tea that never came and was asked if i still want it after we were all done.  --Waitstaff should be cleaning their tables. Specially when its not busy and they are just standing there. There were many tables that need to be bussed. Later on we saw someone bussing, didn't not look like the server, maybe a manager.  We don't in going here again. Corporate needs to get this location checked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Liz K.,"Flint, TX",1,32,6,2.0,10/18/2015,First off food was good. But bathroom smelled like vomit. There was dust and dirty window seals everywhere.   They also had a birthday party which backed the kitchen up. Would have been nice had the manager got some guacamole and chips out on people's table. Something that didn't involve the main oven.  I'll be back to cpk just probably not this location. I can get over having to wait 45 min for a pizza. But the dirty bathroom and restaurant I have to draw the line.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Esmeralda D.,"Houston, TX",0,17,37,5.0,9/26/2015,I always have a great time. Food is good service is awesome. I can't complain its a great place to come with the family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Ciara N.,"Houston, TX",38,268,935,3.0,4/3/2014,Pizzas are good here but I feel like the ones are star pizza is better and during lunch time u can get a salad for for the same price as cpk. Will not be coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
E M.,"League City, TX",0,41,4,3.0,9/15/2016,"Our server, Austen, was just attentive enough, not too much. The pizza was good, and the tea was fine. The only issue I had was that the Caesar salad was not too fresh -- and we were there at the peak of lunch hour. The lettuce seemed like something out of a bag, or left over from last night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
CJ V.,"Houston, TX",0,22,4,4.0,12/20/2015,"Got the lunch special, pizza and soup. Pizza was pretty good and freshly made. Pea and barley soup was very good and not too salt like most soups. Overall a pretty good place for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Susie M.,"Cypress, TX",27,300,84,2.0,4/1/2013,"Well, I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere is very inviting and it has a great location if you want to do a little shopping in the memorial area, particularly the mall. Recently went with a group of four and we all left with a similar feeling of ""Ehh"". Overall the food was unimpressive. We started with the ""guacamole"" which was actually a chunky salsa of roasted corn, black beans, tomatoes and a few pieces of avacoda in it. Not really a guacamole, but good flavors. Our opinion of it was basically ""Well, thats pretentious!"" It wasn't bad, just not as described. The pizzas that we ordered (Original BBQ and Margherita Pizza) were both just OK. The BBQ chicken had a very flavorful sauce, but the chicken was bland and the crust soggy in the middle. The Margherita pizza was good, with big chunks of mozarella and sliced fresh basil on top. The crust on this one was cooked more consistently. I think for a chain pizza place they did an ok job, but with so many other restaurants in the area I probably won't pick this one again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Tim J.,"Houston, TX",40,535,1054,3.0,12/30/2012,"The closest food place inside the mall to the ice rink. While the pizza is decent, it's very fast food feel and not too expensive. The works gets you a supreme that has all the toppings but doesn't taste as great as a properly cooked meat pie. For example, the bell peppers are raw, lack of tomato sauce and the bare application of cheese. It's like a sit down at Pizza Hut when it should be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Esteban Luis F.,"Houston, TX",10,49,7,3.0,7/14/2012,"At California Pizza Kitchen, I ordered for my wife and I their Five Cheese Pizza w/ Fresh Tomatoes and Thai Crunch Salad.  Photos attached. The Five Cheese Pizza with Fresh Tomatoes is worth 5 stars. Bling.  It was delicious from first to last bite.  Its taste is 10x the value for which it is priced.  If it were a company, it would be grossly undervalued and potentially capable of shaking up the Dow Jones Index of blue chip companies. The Thai Crunch Salad is an interesting although colorful but sad salad.  It  resembled Ramen Noodles in a foam cup that was then easily plopped on a plate.  All that remained was adding boiled water. Ramen Noodles can be found at a local grocery store for about $1 for 4 cups of noodles.  The Thai Salad tasted fair at best.  However, it is over priced.   Service earns a mix review:  Our host at CPK appeared lost and distracted while at work.  Our waitress was polite and courteous.  Yet, she is unfamiliar about menu items, nor is she confident to make menu recommendations. Food was delivered timely.  Follow up service to refill tea and water orders was frequent.  A dessert menu and options was offered. Turning CPK around to pick up the remaining 2 stars (out of 5 stars) requires subtle changes and minimal upgrades: 1. Service from wait staff ranges from poor to elementary.  Train to create a uniform level of service that is on path to proficient.  Sales will bolster and tips will run with rises in sales. 2. Upgrade from paper napkins to cloth napkins.  It would compliment the alcohol and wine purchases patrons make to compliment their meal. 3. Reinvent the Thai Crunchy Salad. I wish CPK best in luck and skill to earn the remaining stars.   - Esteban",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Cameron Y.,"Houston, TX",432,1003,879,4.0,5/3/2012,I have yet to eat inside this location but have ordered take out for myself and my boss numerous times. Their curbside take-out is super convenient. The mall parking can be crowded and takeout orders would not be the same without this service. I've had a few salads here and they have been wonderful. They are full of interesting ingredients and extremely flavorful. I also enjoy the thin crust margherita pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Darrell K.,"Katy, TX",85,74,124,4.0,6/6/2014,Looks like there has been an increase in menu prices since I was last here... Most pizzas are around $12-$13 now.

Erin-Cynthia O.,"San Diego, CA",102,13,2,1.0,10/2/2015,"I came here for lunch with a friend earlier today. Neither of us had particularly eaten at CPK more than once, and decided to give it another go. The wait staff was nice enough and the food is a little too bland for me. One thing that definitely turned me away for good, was the fact that toward the end of our lunch a huge dusty roach was crawling along the booth! Of course, I scurried away, because they're terrifying. We notified the staff, to which a server proceeded to grab a plate (for what, I don't know) and some napkins. The manager caught wind of the situation and merely told us that since the booth was located along the windows and carry-out door, roaches are prone to coming in and offered nothing more about the situation. Neither of them caught the roach, I'm guessing they hoped it just disappeared. Not exactly an ideal response, but definitely makes you wonder what's going on in the kitchen as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40

Christopher B.,"Houston, TX",6,23,12,5.0,3/21/2015,First time eating here. We tried a variety of things between the group. Shrimp lettuce wraps were good. The five cheese pizza was amazing.

Darcy S.,"Houston, TX",10,28,11,2.0,12/19/2015,"The mushroom pizza was disappointing. Also, I sent back my strawberry basil martini because I didn't expect the basil aspect of the drink to be just a leaf floating in my drink. The drink itself was grossly strawberry juice flavored. No basil muddled in what so ever. If I paid $8+ for a drink I expect more... Along with the pizza I ordered a fancy salad...doesn't matter what kind because I never received it. I didn't bother mentioning it to the server because the pizza was bland and I figured the salad wouldn't be any better. She didn't know any better and CHARGED us for the damn salad anyways. Wth? I'm pretty sure we were her only table as it wasn't busy that night so you'd think she'd notice if she forgot to bring out a damn entree or not... Boyfriend ordered a $24 steak and he said it tasted burnt... Why's the food so sucky for such a fancy menu?? I don't get it...but I'm glad I tried it because I now know it's not worth it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Kathryn C.,"Friendswood, TX",27,103,85,5.0,10/23/2013,"They had great pizza we ordered the BLT pizza and i thought it was great with soft and crispy crust. I really enjoyed the Mediterranean bread dip as well.  Our service was good also even though we got there at shift change it didnt stop the hostess from making sure we got to order drinks and appetizers before our server got to us. When she got to our table the transition was seamless. At this location they have ""seats"" for American Girl dolls which was a HUGE surprise due to bringing my daughter and her friends dolls they just got from the AG store. They loved that so this is a huge bonus. If i had to say one thing that i was like ""hmmmm"" about is that the table right next to the door and hostess station had a fork that literally stayed on the floor while myself (on my way to the restroom), servers. hostess, and other guest had to step over to walk down the aisle. Pick up the fork! lol Overall my first time at a California Pizza Kitchen and i was very happy with my experience and if in the area again i would revisit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40
Karen D.,"Missouri City, TX",0,6,1,2.0,2/17/2016,"The food was good but the service was poor. We were served our appetizers and bread with our drinks. When the food arrived the table was not cleared and the pizza pasta and additional plates were added to the table. When I asked our server for a spoon for my toddler to eat her pasta she told us ""just wait a minute"". Several minutes later she bought the spoon back. The toddler spilled a drink on the crowed table. I cleaned it up with the paper towels and wrapped it in a placemat. I stood up from the table she walked up to me and I tried to had her the dry placemat. She stepped back and told me to wait and left me holding the placemat. I will be visiting another location next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40

Sara K.,"Houston, TX",14,9,1,1.0,12/13/2015,"I dined at your establishment on Saturday night while Christmas shopping at memorial city. The hostess quoted us 15 minutes and it was probably less before she seated us. Our waitress was wonderful, she brought us everything we needed and went above and beyond. We ordered the bbq chicken pizza, Cajun pasta, soup, and wedge salad. The food was excellent and service was great. We left very happy with our leftovers. The reason I am rating one star is because it won't let me give zero stars. When I got home I immediately opened the pizza box to warm up a slice and to my surprise a small roach ran out of the box. It was one of those small ones that comes from being dirty. I was absolutely disgusted. We had taken home the rest of the pasta and 2 slices of pizza, needless to say, I dumped it in the trash and will no longer dine at this location. I understand things happen but roaches in to go food is beyond disgusting. Please check your Togo boxes and bags as maybe to prevent this from happening to other customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40

Daniel H.,"Houston, TX",29,53,24,5.0,10/21/2017,"We came here on a Saturday afternoon, got sat quickly!  We ordered 2 pizzas and one side salad along with a beer. Food taste is great, we loved the flavour of the pizzas and Caesar salad was not overly dressed!  Server Ruben was very attentive, always kept an eye on us, answer our questions and order cake up as we expected. By the end of our meal, we found a long hair on the last two slices. I did not want to say anything but my wife insisted. We got offered another meal by the manager who   us within seconds  but we actually didn't care much about it since we were almost done we our dinner, we finished the pizza anyway.  Manager applied a 20% discount even though we did not want anything else or ask for it. Thst was a nice touch of him. We took care of the servers tip to make up for it.

Addressed my experience to the hostess and left.  No need to slice and dice this review. My rating speaks for itself. I just hope it's addressed or find new staff to this location.  Will not return. ******Update******* The manager called me the next day regarding my experience. He seems to know the issue, possibly it's a reoccurring matter that finally shed some light on.

Like idk how the owners have people who are inconsistent with their job responsibilities still on pay role. I'm always waiting up to 45mins at curb side for my order and I only order the salmon pieces from here. The customer service sucks and they're ALWAYS TRYING to over charge me.

Shelene L.,"Houston, TX",39,256,359,2.0,3/26/2017,"Just ok. Service - 4/5 - The restaurant was clean and the waiter was quite personable. Taste - 2/5  - Our order consisted of a bowl of potato soup and ""The Works"" pizza.  The soup was not white or cream colored as expected.  But almost the ""golden"" color.  Totally not what was expected.  The pizza was loaded with toppings just just lacked flavor.  I asked for a Cherry Coke and sent it back for a regular because it had a funny taste.

David L.,"Highlands, TX",2,71,124,4.0,11/8/2017,California Pizza kitchen is a good change from regular pizza places.

Kacy M.,"Houston, TX",191,262,467,3.0,11/27/2016,I came here with a friend after a night movie (also at Memorial City Mall) and it was packed and super noisy. We got a table after a short wait but were surrounded by large parties of people. Screaming kids and loud adults don't make for an appealing dinner atmosphere at all. The pizzas here are pricey but me and my friend aren't huge eaters so we each got a kids size personal pizza from the kids menu which filled us up nicely and wasn't expensive. We also got crayons and a coloring page even though we were clearly adults. Our waiter decided to humor us and we appreciated that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston
Andy C.,"Houston, TX",1,8,8,1.0,6/19/2017,"It was not event 50% full on Sunday night.  The service was slow as it took them almost 30 min to prepare: 1) a salad dish; 2) a pasta dish ; 3) a pizza and 4) medium rare ribeye.  It took them another 15 min to get a kid's BBQ pizza and 2 ice cream sundae.  You guessed it right: the ice cream were melted. There was no team work with the entire wait staff and the managers.  We waived to the staff at the counter for service, one staff got attention of another staff, who tried to get a a manager's attention.  And no one came until 5 min later came our waitress.

Location: Not great at all, its in memorial city mall and so if you're just wanting to go here then parking is awful. If you're in the mall walking around thats a great opportunity to grab some food. Food: Their pizzas are fine. Their salads are GREAT! Their thai salad is what dreams are made of. I try to get it every time i'm in town, however sometimes the thought of driving over there and finding parking is enough to deter me. The times I have eaten inside, the service is fine.

Sarah R.,"Houston, TX",101,77,57,1.0,2/2/2016,"What a disgusting disappointment. We came in today and were told to sit at the bar because they had no tables open (this is where the trouble starts)... The only thing was that there was a booth and multiple tables available. However, we decided to bite the bullet at sit at the bar. This is when the less than par service began.  We ordered two pizzas and watched them get prepared. Now as my pizza was ready the bar tender who had touched, money, her cell phone, wiped her nose and was handling multiple beer tabs stuck her hand in the basil and then PUT IT ON MY PIZZA. How unsanitary and DISGUSTING is that?!  Worst part, this was all happening while the male manager and female manager were present.

Chirag S.,"West University, Houston, TX",1,6,,2.0,4/22/2017,"The food we ordered was okay, but the ambience and service left something to be desired.  First of all, the music was far too loud, especially for families with small children.  There were at least 5 other tables with young children; the music level felt like we were at a club.  We had to yell to communicate at our table.  I spoke to the manager; he stated that the volume is ""a set level at a set time.""  My suggestion: change that level.  We dined at around 8p on a Saturday.  This wasn't an issue in the past. Secondly, we ordered Merlot and received Pinot Grigio.  We ordered kids spaghetti and got kids fusilli.  The waitress then suggested that we should have ordered ""spaghettini.""  I've never heard of confusion around the term spaghetti.  They did ultimately fix the food/drink errors and take the erroneous items off of the final balance by having them show as comped, but their suggested tip (the calculated values at the bottom of the receipt) included those erroneous items.

Zain R.,"Houston, TX",222,318,912,4.0,10/24/2015,"This was a tough review to write that's why I followed my history professor's advice of letting cooler heads prevail. After letting the food and the experience digest, I decided to go with the four star rating rather than a three. I had friends waiting for me waiting inside when I got there. The hostess seemed to be a little preoccupied with putting her fingers through her hair and looking more playful rather than attentive but I dashed right in waving at my friends without letting her have the chance to acknowledge me so maybe I should not be so critical of her.  After I seated myself, the server quickly approached me and asked me for my drink. She was on fleek. When one of us asked for the potato soup and they were out of it, she was quick to recommend the squash soup. It was everything I needed right there and then. *side note: I have not been to CPK since 2010 because I discovered that they stopped serving their Mango Chicken Tandoori Pizza in 2009. It was my absolutely favorite thing ever! I really hope that they bring it back!!! I came to this location back in 2010 after a breakup with my bff and I had bad memories associated with it but after the service I received this trip, I am a changed man* Minus one star for the really tasteless oil thing served with the bread. Call me an EVOO snob but that oil mixture served  with my bread lacked flavor like a fake Chanel at the Met Gala. We ordered the Sicilian and the Roasted Artichoke + Spinach with added chicken pizzas. I really like my vegetables and if anyone who knows me knows that I loved making my own pizza (dough made from scratch) but both pizzas were just oh so incredible. I don't eat pork products - mostly because they make my stomach hurt - but I not only broke my religious dietary code that night but I also decided to not follow my self inflicted dietary code and I am so glad I did. The Sicilian is one mean pizza and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to give meat pizzas a try. The dessert was just the right amount of rich. Although I couldn't stomach more than three spoonfuls, my bf and his brother loved every bite of it. All in all, coming to CPK after a nearly five year hiatus has made me a happy customer and I will definitely frequent it more often.  P.S. Y'all need to bring back the chicken tandoori pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston

Sharon A.,"Katy, TX",27,169,263,4.0,7/1/2016,"Well I am a overall fan of California pizza kitchen. I love all the flavor combinations of their pizzas. My favorite being the bbq chicken pizza. The spinach dip is delicious but eat it before it cools down as it tends to conjeal.  In my opinion the orchard sangria was not worth the $9 at all!  Absolutely no alcohol, tons of ice, served in a tall, thin glass unlike what the pictured depicted and unlike what a sangria is typically served in.

Nothing But The Trut H.,"Houston, TX",99,196,186,1.0,12/8/2016,"This review is strictly for my last visit which was Veteran's Day 2016. I ordered from the VD menu ... Hawaiian pizza. I also got the chocolate moose dessert. Even though I didn't pay for the pizza, I was extremely disappointed with its quality. I wish I took a picture of it. Extreme thin crust, a few pieces of small pineapples here and there, and all the ham were just plain (no applewood ones)!!!! I wouldn't be paying $13.99 for a crappy pizza like that. I couldn't really believe how CPK went down on the quality like that. Smh. The dessert was okay. It was around $6. It was super duper sweet plus overpriced. If I was dining alone, I wouldn't care about getting that. Since I felt so bad about this, I had a talk with one of the managers on 11/23/16. He promised to mail me some free coupons, and it had been over 2 weeks now! I don't think it takes a long time to receive them. He probably just wanted to lie about it in order to brush me off. Heh ... okay if that's how he wanted me gone ... I will be gone for good. No second chance to try them out. CPK asked for it, not me. Anyway, I had zero interest to deal with liars. I will just go back to Kroger to get their frozen pizzas. No worries. They are cheaper and taste 200% better than CPKs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston

The manager that took our drink order brought out a ""surprise"" for us when he found out it was our first ever visit here - a sample of the White Corn Guacamole and Chips. It was delicious and such a nice gesture! The pizza we got was the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage - also super delicious! The pizza comes with 6 slices as the menu says, although they are usually meant for one person since the crust is a lot thinner than you would expect. We shared our pizza and the Crispy Mac & Cheese appetizer, which turned out to be just enough food for the two of us. The staff was very helpful, with someone always stopping by to check on drink refills - even if they weren't our server.

Steven P.,"Plano, TX",0,9,1,1.0,10/11/2017,"Unfortunately, this is one of my wife's favorite places to eat and it's the only location reasonably close to my house. As a result, they will most likely continue to get my business and disappoint. I've ordered with them multiple times, I've eaten inside a few times as well and either way, it's awful service. There's usually one single person running around doing everything while everyone else sits around, literally. I saw the hostesses sitting down behind the podium where the guests sit when they wait. Terrible. Every time I order, I either have to go in to get it or wait 10-15 minutes at curbside until they decide to bring out my cold food. I call in to order and sit on hold so long I hang up and call back in. The other thing that is frustrating is that if you actually make your own effort to get someone to help you, most of the employees will be rude and catch an attitude with you. If you are a patient person and LOVE this place, keep coming back. If you are going on a date or business dinner/lunch, don't go here. Service sucks, food is mediocre compared to other locations I've been to and they take FOREVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=20
Taylor D.,"Houston, TX",119,59,27,1.0,7/20/2016,"I used to eat at this specific CPK all the time when I was younger and it honestly brings back so many great memories for me. Many years have passed, and the food and service have changed into something completely opposite of my childhood pizza wonderland.  My bf and I have eaten here twice in the past year or so. The first time wasn't half bad! We both enjoyed the Sicilian flatbread pizza and the chicken tequila pasta. The second time (aka today), however, was just terrible.  Our server's name was Luisa and she was just terribly awkward. She would ask us questions and when we would reply INSTANTLY, she would stare into our souls for about 3 seconds before replying back...Weird. Anyway, we decided upon the Hawaiian pizza and the chicken alfredo, (can't remember the exact name) both of which were unappetizing. The Hawaiian pizza was really greasy and did not have fresh pinapples on it. The least they could have given me for a 6 piece, $15 pizza... The pasta had a very little amount of chicken and tasted sort of off. Can't really explain it, maybe it was just me. All in all, we weren't satisfied with the food we ordered.  Luisa took forever to give us the check and forever to pick it up afterwards. Really annoying considering that there was barely anyone in the restaurant and we just wanted to get out of there. I can't believe how much this place has changed since I was younger. The prices are way too high for Olive Garden quality food and the service that we received was just ridiculous.

The waitress said no, then said she would be back to provide us some complimentary bread. We waited almost 15 mins, then the manager comes over & says we can adjust the drink by this time it's too late so we ask the manager where the bread was, he said let me go check on that & we will be right back. He never returns, another 15 mins later our food comes out (no complimentary bread). The pizza was luke warm as its was sitting out for awhile.  At this point, I didn't want to ask them to remake because I'm in a rush & have to get back to work.

I'm not sure if the menu is updated periodically, or if it just varies from location to location. My friend and I decided to order the greek pizza instead since it was one of the few pizzas that had veggies other than avocado or mushroom. The greek is topped with grilled chicken, feta cheese, chopped tomatoes, onions, and cucumber. (Basically a gyro in pizza form.) The verdict? It was quite tasty and the pizza dough/crust left a slightly sweet taste to linger on my taste buds after every bite. A pleasant surprise. No complaints aside from the soggy dough towards the middle of the pizza. The result of all the freshly chopped veggies perhaps?  I'd come back for the pizza dough alone.

I wish I could say the same for the one in Houston's Memorial City Mall, but I'm just not a fan.  I've been there three times in the past 18 months or so, and each time I say I'm not going back. This time I really mean it. For whatever reason, every time we go, they seat us in the worst section of the restaurant. I don't want to be crammed next to the kitchen and server area when the rest of the restaurant is practically empty.  They ""offer"" to keep your stroller for you, but really it seems that they don't want you bringing your stroller to the table. I'm sure there's some reason for this, but I'm not interested in having a pricey stroller thrown to the side for their convenience, when I can fold it up myself. Now for the food and drinks - the tea was fresh and pretty good. The food was mediocre. The last time we went, I ordered the five cheese pizza with tomatoes. It was alright, kind of like a frozen pizza is ""alright."" I definitely wouldn't order it again. On another occasion I had the grilled vegetable foccacia sandwich, and it was nothing short of awful - bland and soggy. The kids had the pizza from the children's menu. It reminded me of Chuck E Cheese pizza, not good, but well liked by kids.  Overall, terrible atmosphere due to seating, average service from apathetic employees, mediocre food, but good iced tea.

I tried the spinach and artichoke pizza, and we also ordered my favorite, the Pear and Gorgonzola. The kids had macaroni and cheese, and grilled chicken.  The next time was this past weekend, and it was just my husband and me. We decided to do a day date, and saw Inception, and then headed over there for some pizza. We had a cheesy bread appetizer that came with a bruschetta-like topping. Delicious.  Husband ordered his favorite, the California Club, and I had the Pear and Gorgonzola again -- can't go wrong with it!  I have two small complaints on this visit. One is that we ordered a mixed specialty drink (to share -- we're not exactly afternoon lushes), and it was really, really bad. I'm sorry, but when a restaurant can't make a specialty drink that is specifically pictured and advertised in the drink menu, I have a problem with that.  Also, I noticed what a different experience this place is minus the kids. After the hostess graciously seated us in a romantically located booth outside of traffic, she then blocked us into a corner by seating a family at the table next to us with two extremely loud (although otherwise well-behaved) children.

I used to frequent the CPK in the Galleria area. Here I ordered their Roasted Garlic Chicken pizza, which I use to love, but I found it hard, very, very dry and bland. I'm guessing this was overcooked, perhaps. However, this is not worth the price, at all. I had it for lunch with a glass of pinot grigio and the only thing that didn't disappoint was the wine.

The mahi mahi and spicy chicken tinga quesadilla were fine, but I do find some stuff on their menu finely priced, yet many others overpriced, because the portion doesn't do justice and the flavors are nice, but not as exotic....I could find better elsewhere.  Food is good, but price is eh....could be better 4 items for $55 lunch without tip, and I'm not at a sushi restaurant and even at that, it could also be cheaper. They did have a variety of food that I did not get to try...so maybe 3 stars is harsh, but the prices and portions don't make me want to come back and oh, we sat out in the patio..the mall, but the inside of the restaurant was smoking hot and yet a lot of people were there, like no ac was what it felt like.

That being said, my bar experience at C.C.P.K. was great. The bartender was heavy handed and a joy. This was definitely a better option than eating in the food court.

Boone M.,"Conroe, TX",47,48,51,1.0,12/16/2015,"I ordered Thai chicken salad and asked no cucumbers.  My party was 11 people.  The waitress brought out food for the kids first...""good."" Then brought out our friends food... ""Ok.""  They had pizza and pasta.  Waited 15 minutes before they came out to my wife and I and told her that her pizza was almost ready, and then went on to tell me that they couldn't make my salad without the cucumbers, and stood over me suggesting I make another choice.  The thing is I couldn't just choose anything, as I am on a diet and just spent 30 minutes before we choose our entree's looking at their nutrition guide online.  I was very frustrated and knew that this was not a decision I could make no matter how much I wanted to just eat anything by that time.  I had already seen in the nutrition guide that everything else was over 1000 calories and I would be doing myself no favors to pick something hesitantly.  I told her no thank you.  I ended up having to walk a good way to the center of the mall where I got an overpriced salad that was by far not any good.  My wife finally got her pizza.  The chef came out and apologized and comped her pizza.  Needless to say this situation was a domino effect to a horrible evening.  They really should have told me when I ordered the good or shortly thereafter that they couldn't accommodate my request so that I could have made different decisions before everyone had gotten their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60
Brooke M.,"Cypress, TX",3,85,11,4.0,8/11/2013,"The service here was great! Food came quickly and we were checked up on quite a bit. I usually order the salads here and they never seem to disappoint. The half size will fill you up for sure! Also, their desserts are to die for. SO DELICIOUS. The only reason that they receive a 4 star rating from me is because their pizza isn't as great as I expected it to be. Considering the name is California PIZZA kitchen I thought it would be outstanding, not just 'good'.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60
Brandy C.,"Jonestown, TX",144,418,333,3.0,9/9/2012,"Eh, it's okay. It's an overpriced mall foodplace. No excuse for the standalone locations though.  It's a Pepsi place, so not off to a great start. They've added some cool little appetizers, which is cool, and some of them are fairly decent. I like the hummus and they have a couple eggroll things - I can't remember the flavors, but one is delish, and one is weird. The pizzas are good enough and the salads can be really good (I like the Chicken Cobb), but they are huge. I went with just my kid and it might have been smarter to split something instead of letting him order off the kids' menu. They have a .99 sundae on the kids' menu, and that made my kiddo pleased as anything. I'm sure this place will only get more popular as American Girl opens up soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60

Good thing the delicious pizza will warm me up! If you visit the restaurant frequently then sign up for their rewards club, they send you coupons for free mini apps. If you're visiting the American Girl store they have cute little pink high chairs for dolls to sit in while you eat.  My only issue was tonight they put the order for the pizza in too early and we just had gotten our salads. By the time we were ready to eat it it was soggy and cold.

Anna E.,"Temple, TX",6,24,18,4.0,8/6/2014,"Guest 1 - The Works hand tossed pizza  The ingredients (Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, pecorino Romano, spinach and bacon) were not sauteed,  simply thrown on top of the pizza after the crust was baked. There was an abundance of veggies which were largely sliced. Many were left on the plate. Guest 2 - Five Cheese + fresh tomato hand tossed pizza  This entree was made perfectly and not a crumb was left behind.  Mmm... Guest 3 - Chicken Tequila Fettuccine Another perfectly made dish. I had been craving pasta and this definitely hit the spot. The sauce truly was its secret weapon.  I'd order this again. 2 out of 3 three meals were terrific. That's not bad. Wish the prices were better though. For 3 meals, 2 lemonades, and 1 ice tea = $60. That's a bit pricey in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60

Kat N.,"Sugar Land, TX",206,12,9,4.0,8/14/2012,"The service has improved :) I have frequent this CPK many times and I generally order the same thing at both Houston locations. This location is a bit oddly shaped for lack of better words. It wasn't busy either :T Galleria is better than Memorial Nonetheless, this place killed my pizza craving. When I entered the restaurant, I caught an employee (possibly hostess) off guard. I believe she was ready to leave for the day but she stopped to grab menus, and sat me in a nearby booth. I give her mad props for keeping it professional and taking care of guests first.  Although I was waiting for my friend's arrival, my server EMMA promptly greeting me and took my drink order. I had wanted to surprise my friend with a birthday sundae and she was really sweet to keep it a surprise. After my friend's arrival and placement of the order, Emma offered a complimentary basket of sourdough bread and butter. I feel that she went above and beyond because from my understanding, it's only brought out upon request. We didn't have much a problem with refills either. Emma even waited for my friend to turn his head at the end of the meal so that she could run out with the surprise. That's just AWESOME!  The food itself is pretty consistent. I love my California Club on a thin crust. :) Overall a delightful experience. Not a lot of negatives... I know I didn't write any but they're not perfect just yet... There's room for improvement but with this kind of service at the mall... I might start skipping passed that food court :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60
David R.,"Katy, TX",17,69,,1.0,8/8/2011,"I have loved CPK since I started visiting them many years ago, I found their pizzas to be very creative and most of the times they have decent service.  I usually don't bother writing a bad review as it isn't worth my time and I would rather use it to share a good experience rather than a bad one, but our experience saturday was so bad in so many levels that I don't know what else to do.  We went to the mall early that morning to avoid the crowds, so we sat down to eat quite early, around 11:15am, before the rush. The restaurant was empty. I asked the server if they had sweet tea and she said no, so I settled for regular unsweet tea. When she brings it over and asks me if I want sugar, this should have been a SIGN for me to get up and leave, but noooooo.... let's just stay here... We ordered a mac & cheese appetizer, and although my favorite pizza (Carne Asada) is no longer available, I settled for the new carnitas which is the same thing execpt for the meat (Pork instead of beed) and my wife got a soup/sandwhich combo.  After about 15 minutes of being completely ignored by the waitress (both our drinks were empty) I asked her what happened to the appetizer, to which she told me she forgot to order. ""Don't worry about it"" I said... Literally 5 seconds later another waitress brings my pizza, but my wife's meal is not here... The waitress dissapears again and we don't see her for about 5 minutes, at which point I start asking for a manager... Couple of minutes go by, no server, no manager, so I asked another server for a manager (now 2 different servers now I want a manager) Couple of minutes go by, now I'm up from my seat, and I ask yet another server for a manager. Suddenly our originally server shows up with my wife meals, which again is a soup (which is already made) and a sandwhich, which takes 3 seconds to put together... Before we could even say anything the server just walks away from our table and at this point I'm fuming... I look and see one of the other servers talking to a manager behind the counter so I proceed to go over there. As I'm arriving there, I can hear the manager tell another customer ""I have to go check on this table to that is bugging me"" neadless to say I went off on her right there... What kind of system does this restaurant has in place to have such a major breakdown from top to bottom? I have been involved in the restaurant industry for many years, having several friends hold many positions at all levels and I have never seen such disrespect towards a client.  I wonder if I even want to waste my time contacting headquarters as I truly have got no desire of wasting my time going there ever again.  The worse part is that this bad experience ruined this great restaurant for us, as well as our saturday... I don't get it... Serving food in a restaurant is something that has been going on for so many years now, I mean, it's not like we are sending a rocket to mars or something out of this world... Why is it so hard for some places to even perform such basic duties as putting together a couple of notes, ringing up an order and keeping a glass full for the 20 minutes I'm there...????? Is this too much to ask?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60
Helen C.,"Mesquite, TX",64,61,41,3.0,4/25/2012,"This place was very popular with my coworkers, so I ordered from here a lot. I found the staff to be very pleasant to deal with, and enjoyed the perks of getting free meals due to my large orders. However, I found the food to only be so-so which is a shame since I really liked their frozen pizzas over the last few years. Anyway, here is my thoughts on all of the food I've tried over the past few months: Carnitas and habenero pizza: Only OK overall, but the sauce/salsa that comes with it on the side is REALLY good. Spinach and broccoli soup: tastes like it came from a can - Campbell's to be exact.  Pesto Chicken thin crust pizza: Just OK. chicken tequila fettucine - it was pretty bland. The ""jalapeno cream sauce"" tasted like just a white sauce. The peppers in it tasted fresh and good, but didn't save it.  Japanese eggplant pizza - My husband liked this well enough, especially the mushrooms, but I didn't like it overall chicken club sandwich: It was decent, but would have been much more enjoyable had the bread been warm. But that might just be because I ordered it to-go. Hawaiian pizza on thin crust.: The toppings on this were good. I only wish their thin crust was crispy rather than soft. I'd gotten used to their thin crust being crispy from the frozen pizzas. Update: Moroccan chicken salad - this salad is amazing!! I absolutely love it and have ordered it twice now, and will order again. A few more entrees like this and I'll have to give the place an additional star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60
Nelly N.,"Houston, TX",10,60,14,4.0,5/28/2012,"This is the only CPK I've dined at, except for the one in Las Vegas McCarran Int'l Airport, and I wouldn't expect much from that as it's not even a full-service location. So based on my multiple instances here (people's birthday dinners, lunches with friends, etc.) I've been coming here for quite a few years. I'm not here often, but my multiple visits seem to have added up. The pizza is always delicious. The crust could use a hand or two, but the actual toppings and cheese and stuff makes it really delicious. I love the chipotle chicken pizza, chicken bbq, buffalo chicken, and a few more I can't remember. The good thing about this place is that it ends up being really cheap when you share. Went to a friend's birthday dinner, we ordered 3 or 4 pizzas and fed six people with under $45. Not bad at ALL. So yeah, great place, the service is fine, never noticed it being bad or good.

My favorite has always been the bbq chicken, it's so delicious! I love the red onions and the sweet bbq sauce, the flavors all go together really well. This last time I went I decided to take the plunge and try something new, so I went for their spicy chicken chipoltle pizza. Normally when this happens I'm always disappointed, in this case I was glad that I went for it!

Janice N.,"Spring, TX",427,5,,4.0,9/17/2012,"Service was great! Refills for my mango iced tea kept coming without being asked. The server also brought plates and new plates without being asked. I also noticed that the manager on duty was attentive to every table. He was always asking if everyone was enjoying their meal. The food is always good here, but not extravagant (why it's not 5 stars). I enjoyed the chicken tequila fettucine (I think that's what it is)... it had a hint of a lime-y creamy Alfredo sauce... sort of like a delicious curry tossed in with noodles. YUMMY. I also enjoyed the avocado egg rolls. I love avocado so I knew that I couldn't go wrong with that. It similar to BJ's.  The BBQ chicken pizza is also a must! I love pineapples on my pizza, and the bbq just added more zest, along with the onions. I always get this here.
