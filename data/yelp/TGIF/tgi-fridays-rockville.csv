Kristin E.,"Washington, DC",208,63,28,4.0,1/8/2018,"I've been here several times being from the DC area. There's only a handful of Fridays close to me, this being one of those locations. This review is *mostly* based on my most recent experience. My best friend and I came over from the shopping center across the street wanting some good bar food for lunch. Of course, the restaurant was less populated than it is at night or on the weekend, but it was still pretty busy. Our server was great and it wasn't super loud per the norm.  We ordered The Fridays Combo with boneless bbq wings, loaded potato skins and mozzarella sticks. The only thing I was disappointed with on the appetizer were that the potato skins were pretty dry and sour cream wasn't put as a dip (which I think it is supposed to make an appearance?). I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla as my entree and I've honestly had better. 6/10.  Overall, I recommend this location, especially if you're going to get a drink and catch a game at the bar. The bartenders are pretty nice and make a good drink, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville
Jackie R.,"Silver Spring, MD",8,92,29,3.0,11/14/2017,"Eh my experience has been so so here. no bad customer service but i don't really have high standards for t.g.i. friday's . I overall had an ok experience but it could've been better . this would be a 3.5 Star  Came to the bar and ordered my favorite strawberry henny, delicious and refreshing  ! the appetizers took awhile , but the bartenders were attentive and friendly . I did feel like we were forgotten about a few times ? We had the jack sliders and the buffalo wings apps . The wings were a little spicy but the meat was good. My sliders were delicious ! I'll come back just for the drinks but the staff was really friendly ! Plenty of room .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville
Taniya G.,"Fairburn, GA",316,10,1,1.0,11/5/2017,"horrible. the bartenders and I say bartenders because this goes for every last one of them behind the bar. THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS ON THEIR MENU.  To start we sat at the bar for 5 minutes before being acknowledged and once we finally got the attention of the young woman working she asked if we wanted to order appetizers...? I responded with ""yes, we would like to order drinks first, because we've been sitting here waiting."" I asked her for the Proficiency Pinot Noir - which was on their Happy Hour menu. She brought me back white wine. I asked her. ""Is this the Pinot Noir?"" she said ""yes.""  PINOT NOIR IS A RED WINE. I coached her by letting her know this and she returned with a glass of Meiomi.  Although this is not the listed wine on their Happy Hour I was tired of telling someone how to do their job. My boyfriend ordered a Budlight- also on Happy Hour. The bartender comes back and announces that he has a tall Miller lite. We gave it back to him without drinking it and asked for it be replaced with a Blue Moon (also on Happy Hour) he came back with a fresh beer and all was great.  We ordered the basket of bones, which was delicious but before we could enjoy we had to ask for silverware and the ranch and blue cheese that was to come with our appetizer. I'm disappointed because TGI is such a fun, nice place to come where the food is good and the drinks are tasty. But the Rockville Pike staff have no idea what's on their menu to sell and have zero to no hospitality. GET IT TOGETHER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville
Rosanna W.,"Rockville, MD",79,163,341,2.0,1/2/2018,"Oh man oh man. TGI Fridays. I haven't been here in ages. We got seated right away. Ordered our drinks and asked for a few more minutes to look at the menu. They have so many options on their menu. After we knew what we wanted, we waited for our waiter to come back. Everytime he passed by our table, I would look at him hoping to catch his attention and he completely would avoid eye contact with me. Finally he came back and took our orders.  We ordered the appetizer platter - chicken wings and mozzarella sticks and the cajun shrimp and chicken pasta (half size).  I saw a waiter and waitress just chillin, sitting with their friends talking. Not paying attention to any of their tables. Just chatted up for a bit. They would leave here and there, but I never seen such poor service at a restaurant. The food took forever to come.... and once it did come, the half size pasta for $10 was really small. It comes in a small little pan. The pasta wasn't bad at all, but for $10 and the size we got was not worth it. When we received our food, we didn't get any utensils or napkins. My small pasta came with a spoon... why would you give someone a spoon to eat pasta? .... It took forever to flag down our waiter because he was too busy talking to his friends. Finally received our utensils.. and finally we ate... Terrible awful service. Food took forever. Don't think I'll be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville
Christine M.,"Rockville, MD",87,109,420,1.0,8/1/2017,"The only thing good about this place is that it has one of my favorite pasta dishes and unlimited appetizers. However, nothing else about this restaurent is good. The host and bartenders are rude and even though I constantly returned, I will no longer give them my service.  Sunday night we were at Friday's and the waitress decided to give herself a $30 tip when our food only came to $25. Now I have to dispute the charge and on top of that, right before the restaurent closed they start blasting music, turn up the lights and made it evident they wanted everyone to leave. It was a Sunday and the bartender put on her personal music with so much profanity I thought the manager was going to come out and cut it off --- but that didn't happen. I'm done with Friday's.

Debbie S.,"Falls Church, VA",0,6,,1.0,1/12/2018,Only reason to give a start was our waiter who tried to accommodate us and be as nice as possible. We made a reservation 4 days ahead for 12 only to get to the restaurant and learn they did not take it. We had to wait over 40 minutes to get seated for another 30 to get the order and another 30 for the food. Our waiter even though very personable seem to have a lot of tables to take care of as we hardly saw him. Meanwhile 2-3 waiters were talking and texting at the hostess table all the time.

Every single employee we encountered tonight from the host, the servers(we saw about 6 different ones at our table over the course of the night) and managers were all incredibly rude and disrespectful. I have never left a business as angry as I was tonight. We were here for 2+ hours for the worst service ever. The appetizers were good, but there was hair in my food and my husbands food was cold.

This unprofessional little girl made the second drink with another type of liquor not henny as request . After informing her I didn't want this drink she throw the drink in the floor.

Before I could settled in my bar seat, Richie the Bartender was cleaning the area down thoroughly. While he was place setting he asked what I wanted, kudos for multitasking. & of course, great customer service from the door...coming & going.  Bianca another Bartender stepped in & provided awesome service as well. I don't frequent TGIF often as their menu is pretty limited for my preferences yet I could see myself returning for the Alamos wine & veggie crudités they made specially for me, much obliged.

They have daily drink specials where you can usually get a decent choice of drinks $3 - $5. They have great specials on appetizers too! Sign up for their Stripes card.  They send you coupons in your email for different discounts on entrees and you save up points for discounts, free dessert, free entrees and more.  The service is hit or miss both in the bar and at a table. The employees tend to have a bit of an attitude.

Our sever, Albert, was very pleasant when he was at the table but had no sense of urgency so we made no complaints. For entrees my brother ordered a burger medium and it came well done. I had a fried chicken sandwich and the chicken itself was absolutely disrespectful. The edges so black it looked like beef at first. I picked off some edges and we waited for our server to appear.

Ordale A.,"Washington D.C., DC",203,251,24,2.0,7/7/2016,"Hmph. TGI Fridays? More like WTH Fridays! This was my first time at this location but Fridays is like McDonald's bigger brother. The food usually tastes the same regardless of which one you go to. I don't know what happened at this one though. My friends brought me here for my birthday. They suggested sushi but NO I just had to request a place that had drinks, appetizers, desserts, and a lot of noise because I was planning to turn up...on a budget (hence Fridays).  First off the waiter was very personable. He was a cool guy who told us we'd come to the right place to celebrate because just that night they were having a bartending competition, so the drinks would be phenomenal.  Riiiight. How about 'no,' Scott? Scene 1: Drinks My margarita tasted like dirty dish water. I don't know what the hell went wrong with that. There was zero alcohol in it and if it hadn't been for the fact that it was frozen I would actually think that it was dirty dish water. My friends also hated their drinks as well. No getting drunk for us.  Scene 2: The appetizer... Spinach artichoke dip. Had it millions of times before. My first bite, something sharp went up into the sweet spot between my teeth and gums. I spent a few minutes pulling sharp artichoke ""thingamajigs"" (bristles?) out of my gum. Imagine a bunch of shredded tooth picks. The chips were hard as hell too.  Scene 3: The entree... I got old faithful, Sizzling chicken and shrimp. The chicken was overcooked by a lot. Like...dry on the inside, super dry and chewy on the outside. The shrimp were okay.  I decided to not even waste my time with dessert. I ended up going to another restaurant afterwards for that.  The ONLY saving grace for this place was the manager, Jake. He happened to be going around to various tables asking about our experience. My friends were paying and I didn't want to seem ungrateful, so I just smiled and nodded. One of my friends, however, told him about the drinks. He apologized profusely and said that we should've sent them back. He offered to take the drinks off the bill and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit. He took them up to two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=40

I had the lobster and flat iron steak dish and the steak was great, cooked rare perfectly and tender with healthy chunks of lobster on top. Their mac & cheese had a nice mild cheesy flavor as well. A hit with our group in particular were the fried green bean appetizers and the french onion soup. The only few issues perhaps I would talk about were that our waiter took a long time to check on us during the meal to bring us the check and take-out boxes, the bathroom had an overly strong cleaning smell, and the ribs were a bit dry.

The first time we stuck with appetizers. We got the mozzarella sticks- good, can't mess those up too bad. The pot stickers were good, that was my favorite out of the 3. Then we got the wings, which were ok, I'm not that big on wings.  The second time I came we only got dessert. We started with the brownie sundae. I must say super good! The brownie was soft and almost gooey but not under baked. Of course this was too small for me and my friend to share so we also got the oreo madness dessert. This was good, not amazing. If you like cookies and cream ice cream this would be for you! We asked for extra chocolate sauce and the bartender gave us the whole bottle to use! That was really awesome we doused that in chocolate. This has vanilla ice cream layered between oreo cookie crust.

Nicole R.,"Sebastian, FL",155,148,7,1.0,6/26/2013,"TGI Friday's is mediocre no matter which way you cut it. We knew that going into this dinner. But, my brother was in town for one night and staying down the street so we came from VA to meet him (big mistake, Maryland, as far as states go, is mediocre itself) for a quick dinner. There were 6 of us ... myself and my husband, my sister and her friend, and my brother and his coworker.   Everything was fine aside from the fact that they were out of pretty much every on-tap beer (literally, we requested 3-4 and somehow, they had ""just run out in the last few minutes,"" yet it was a Sunday night around 9pm, and there weren't that many people there ... but, I digress).  We ordered, got our food ... my brother's coworker finally settled on Mich Ultra, because they were out of a bunch of bottled beer too (seriously!?), and it only took about 20 minutes to get each of his two beers. When it came time to pay our bill, I told the waitress one check was fine, we could split it (as my husband and I were together, my sister and her friend split something but were paying separately, and my brother was paying for his coworker).  She insisted on splitting it for us, and came back with 6 checks.  No big deal, I gave her my credit card wrapped in both my husband's check and mine. When the checks came, everyones appeared to be correct, we signed and left. Well, today, it looks like that waitress didn't charge me for hubby's meal, and wound up closing it out on my sister's credit card (sister is a broke college student who works hard for her money) ... AND she tipped herself MORE than I tipped her.  So, essentially, at the end of the night, she decided she wanted to make more money and tipped herself and extra almost $4. So, my sister, in essence, paid for her meal and my husbands, and tipped this idiot waitress double.  She's disputing the charge with her bank and we've both called the restaurant and spoken to the manager, Amanda (who was very nice and helpful), and she's looking into it. Either way. Even if this WAS a mistake and she did accidentally close out the wrong check on the wrong card, the waitress tipped herself and I'm sorry, but that's shady, dishonest, and frankly ILLEGAL. We've been assured that it'll be taken care of, sister will get her money back, and the waitress will be ""handled.""

Well our hostess forgot the silverware and it went downhill from there. Out servers name was Joanne and she had the personality of a brick. She was extremely unattentive and left out leftover dishes as she walked past us several times. When she wasn't doing that she just wasn't around for long stretches! I ordered a steak and she didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked. Not to mention she brought it out without the shrimp. When told of this she acted as if I should get over it.

Zachary T.,"Rockville, MD",1,9,,2.0,8/4/2013,"Despite having an abundance of staff at their disposal, service moved at a snails pace. The young servers and runners were often seen loafing around the drink station enjoying eachother's company, instead of attending to guests. The descriptions of the dishes were sometimes incomplete, and the staff isn't as knowledgable as they should be.  Despite the half price appetizer deal on the menu, the receipt did not reflect the deal and we almost didn't catch their almost 10$ mistake.  I likely would not return here again, and definitely not recommend it to friends. Bring back the old Fridays, it was vastly superior to this iteration.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=100
Bethany S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",99,49,6,1.0,10/12/2012,"I know it's a large chain, so take every experience with a grain of salt. Even having very low expectations, they still managed to surprise me with how terrible they are. Because we had read the reviews about this location, we did not go until recently. One evening, we just wanted drinks and dessert. We heard if we sit at the bar the service was much better, so we did follow that advice. Let me just preface this, with whoever is in charge of writing the menu descriptions at corporate headquarters, wherever they are, is the only one doing their job right apparently. This is what we read online (viewed on our phones so images did not load. you know, flash...) ""Oreo® Madness Cookies and Cream ice cream sandwiched between layers of Oreo® cookie crust with caramel and fudge."" Okay, that sounds pretty good. Here's how our experience went down: Sunday afternoon, and while a football game was on, it was neither Redskins nor Ravens, therefore, really wasn't that busy. And there were 3 bartenders. We were there 10 minutes before being acknowledged. We asked what the drink specials were, the only thing we were told was $3 Budweiser/Bud Light. My boyfriend settled for Bud light and I just ordered bottled beer. But then we read the specials menu, and sure enough, there were rail drink and cocktail specials they did not tell us about, that were still going on for 2+ more hours. We ordered our desserts. And my boyfriend's ""Oreo Madness"" came out, and it was simply a Klondike Oreo Ice Cream sandwich, with some hershey's syrup drizzled on the plate. The same exact ice cream sandwiches that you can buy by the 6 pack for $2.50 at the grocery store.  So much for ""layers of cookie crust with caramel and fudge"" because there was not even a hint of caramel anywhere on the plate. Lesson learned won't do that again. Despite this, we decided to stay for another drink or two.  THIS WAS BY FAR THE WORST PART Of the THREE bartenders working, every single one of them was completely IGNORING us.  As soon as we would make eye contact with them, they instantly turned around and walked the other direction. All of them did this at least 5 times. Then, when we ordered the rail drinks that were on special, they rolled their eyes and acted like it was the biggest inconvenience in the world for them to make them. It was 15 minutes before we got our second drinks. Then it took 20 minutes and more than 5 more times of getting ignored after making eye contact, that we could get our check. I'm even surprised my boyfriend left a tip, because the service was so terrible, if I were the one that picked up the tab, they would have gotten a big fat ZERO. I will never go to another TGI Fridays in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=100

At the end of the meal, my friend's $15 meal turns into a $30 meal.  It turns out his salmon wasn't included in their combo meal and the waiter either didn't notice or bother to say anything when he ordered.  I tasted his salmon and it wasn't even worth the $15. After we pay, we get back our paper change minus our coin change.  If they asked, I wouldn't really care if they kept the coin change, but the presumption that we wouldn't care irritated me.

Dee C.,"Germantown, MD",0,16,,1.0,3/20/2017,Myself and a friend visited TGI Fridays on a Saturday for a late lunch. The restaurant was a little packed so we sat at the bar. I ordered a drink my friend however could not find her ID and was unable to order a drink. I then noticed a table became available and asked to be seated in a booth. During this time my friend found her ID and asked for a drink. The waiter ID'd her and walked away to place the order. He then came back 10 mins later and requested to see both of our ID's. We again pulled them out and showed him. Placed an order and waited for our food. 5 mins later he comes back again and says I am going to have to send the manager over because there seems to be an issue with your IDs. The bartender advised me your friend didn't have an ID. We explained yes she could not find her license however once situated she was able to locate it. Again we both showed our licenses. 5 mins later the manager comes and asks whats the issue. We explained we're being asked repeatedly to show our Ids and we have shown them multiple times. She had no remorse or sympathy regarding this and didn't have an explanation as to why we were asked to show our ID multiple times. At this point I am starting to get upset as I have never experienced an issue with my license before. I am a 28 year old woman with a valid drivers license. I've visited the same location with the same ID multiple times with no issues at all. So after again explaining to her the issue she asks to see them AGAIN. At this point I have showed my license at least 5 times and I am fed up. I informed the manager she is no help and this is ridiculous to be harassed over a license. She just stood there looking dumb.

Friday's is the place to go when you want some deep-fried, crappy bar food and some happy hour drink specials on beer. Needless to say, we were caught in the midst of a winter storm the other day and having not gone to the grocery store, we decided to brave the cold and walk over to Friday's to see what was on the menu. We got there and waited at the hostess stand for a good 5 minutes while 3 employees stood in the back and held a conversation. 1 of those employees happened to be the manager who finally approached us and asked if we needed a table...? Perhaps this was just an anomaly-as it's perfectly normal for people who don't want a seat/table to walk into an empty restaurant during a storm and stand around at the wait stand just for the hell of it.  Well, once we were shown to our table we sat there for well over 5 minutes without having anyone come over and offer us water or anything. (REMINDER-THIS PLACE WAS EMPTY!!!) We were fed up at this point and decided to leave.

We came we entered we stood we were seated we ordered we waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited some more...the waiter dude finally brought us our drinks so we continued to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait...Waiter stopped by ""Sorry guys for the wait but the kitchen is really getting backed up please bear with me"". Explained waiter dude. Okay fine so we wait and wait and wait...Waiter dude finally comes with our food, YEAH!!!! ohhhhh after all that waiting the food of course was a let down. But hey in here it's Friday's what did you expect. Fiancee saw an TV ad and the food looked so good to her that she was thinking about it the entire day. Even the picture in the menu looked delicious. When chicken and shrimp dish got in front of her it looked nothing like the TV ad nothing like the picture in the menu. Not over cooked, not spectacular just okay. Oh No, fiancee is now disappointed, ""Don't worry dear just turn that frown upside down with another drink"" but now she had developed a headache. So no more drink only dessert latter yes that'll made her feel better a little. Me now, I know better. What you see isn't what you get when it comes to pictures and TV. My steak was a smallish cut suitable for children really. No vegetation served with lots and lots of sweet potato fries. Everything tasted okay but just small in size. Steak cooked medium they way I like wish there was more of it. I don't like filling up on fries alone. As always had to polish off fiance's left over chicken. Desert time ordered coffee. What colour is this coffee looks like tea uugh it's neither ""I apologize"" said waiter dude ""I'll get a fresh pot for you"" thanks waiter dude. So now coffee is right umm that's good coffee I'll have a second cup. Vanilla bean cheese cake is here umm umm real good.  The kitchen was backed up for about 30-40 mins. but waiter dude was good about it and gave us a free desert/appetizer voucher on our next visit. He was cool he did his job well it was not his fault the kitchen was slow. Maybe they were on there break back there. Food was good for what it is. This is Friday's not Mortons or anything like that. It supposedly a quick meal and hangout for people on their way to or from someplace. Portions could have been a little more generous. I'm not expecting Cheese Cake Factory size plates but just a little more to fill in the cracks. Check that Merlot a little too acidity but then again it's house Merlot ???? My Mojito was nice and strong a little too strong maybe. Or it could have been just the long wait and no food but anyhow I had to take my time to let it wear off before leaving.

Rani H.,"Rockville, MD",10,10,,1.0,1/29/2012,"I have been coming to Fridays and even recommending it to friends for years now. I, myself, am a waitress for an OSI company and am very familiar with this industry. Nobody likes it when a group comes in the hour before close but its our job; thus, we deal with it and provide the best service we can. I will NEVER recommend to TGI Friday's on Rockville Pike again! this was the most appalling experience i have ever had at a restaurant. the bartenders gave us great service and my complaint is not against them. i was with a group of other servers and we had just gotten off work when we decided to come in and eat at the bar.the meal went fine, food was good, and the drinks were good. At the end of our meal an aggressive white man who (and i seriously intend no sarcasm)we all thought was drunk came and yelled at myself and another lady with our group that we had 15 minutes to finish our food an ""get out"" while nursing whatever it was he had in a styrofoam cup. we were already sorting out our bill and packing our food to go so as not to be a pain when this guy came by. the guys with us even scooted closer to my friend and i because some weirdo was yelling at us and appeared to be picking a fight with a patron behind us. Then, to top it off he and an old man start screaming like they are looking for a fight at all the patrons to drink up. Is it really necessary to encourage people to chug their alcohol and then get out and drive home? way to be responsible. these men were aggressive as hell and were even goading people into a physical altercation (which we all stared at in shock and were afraid a fight would break out)out when they decided to start taking cups from peoples lips and tossing them over the bar like animals. the only time i have seen people act this reckless and belligerent is when i've had to deal with drunks camping at my own job and picking fights. these so called managers took full beers and dumped them out in front of customers while goading. this was childish behavior and i cannot believe it is tolerated by your company. i will never go back to that restaurant nor recommend it again. these guys didn't listen to a single thing their customers had to say and sent a full bar of angry people storming out while their bartenders sat by looking like they hated simply being there. we paid our full bill even though three tall beers and a margarita were  tossed out and our coworker was shoved around like we were kids in a school yard and had a margarita snatched from his mouth as he way drinking from the straw! are you serious! it was ridiculous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=160

Art T.,"Crofton, MD",189,383,136,3.0,7/19/2016,"Chains are always hit or miss to review.  For one thing, while your experience at one should be the same across the board, due to franchising and staff it's impossible to guarantee this.  So, the intent of creating a cookie-cutter event isn't always achievable.  Another reason I'm always leery about reviewing chains, because of their prevalence, one typically has an expectation when visiting any location. So it was with T.G.I.Friday's, which was the destination after an event at a local Rockville hangout.  I have to admit, this was a bit above my expectations, though still close enough to them to warrant the rating. PROS:  * The servers were very friendly, and I think everyone's order was accurate (we were a big table).  I'll reference the drink situation in the CONS below. * My pretzel sticks were really good, some of the best I've ever had.  There was a light crispy exterior, almost like a fried coating, though probably butter glazed.  But super fresh and warm and soft.  The beer cheese dip was a great side for them.  I'd order these again. * Parking was pretty easy to find, even on busy Rockville Pike.  The lot has a lot of spaces, though I would be cautious during holidays.  I'm sure it gets packed then. * Décor was fun, and not too over-the-top. CONS: * There was a problem with our drinks.  A few people ordered beers, and because they brought them out all at the same time without any way of differentiating them, they got mixed up, and nobody knew which beer was whose.  Very sloppy. * The rest of the food I tried (we all did a bunch of apps) was only okay.  The mozzarella sticks were actually very bland.  The marinara was likewise almost flavorless.  The buffalo wings were okay, mildly spicy and well cooked.  But nothing was really that awe-inspiring, or even that noteworthy (aside from my aforementioned pretzel sticks). * We were sat in the room with the sloped glass ceiling.  The lights were almost touching our heads even though we were seated.  Very poor design. * The restroom was filthy.  I went once to wash my hands when we arrived, and the condition was unchanged about two hours later as we were leaving. There were definitely some pluses, but not enough for me to rave about this place.  It was decent, a normal TGIF experience from my own personal expectations.  Which, admittedly, are typically not very high at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=20

Went to CeCe's Pizza first -don't judge, never been there and will never step in their door again- waited way too long in line for what looked like a pretty crappy buffet.  High tailed it out of there and saw the beckoning lights of Friday's.  Fond memories of good times and bar food lured us in, and it was exactly what we were looking for!  Got seated right away and our nice waiter Vinnie was right there to take our drink order....he must know how people feel after getting off the Pike!  Anyway, sat there enjoying big beer schooner and yummy cosmos, and food came right away.  I had the baby back ribs, and wedge salad - hubby had pot stickers and Cobb salad.  Not show stopping, but not awful either - exactly what you expect for a Friday's.  The real reason I'm writing all this is to commend the service!  Our waiter was great, stopped by just enough, made great suggestions, cleared the table right away.  I also saw the manager (or just some guy in a suit) cleaning floors, checking on guests, and just plain keeping the place running smoothly for a busy football watching night.  Surprised by how many folks were there in jerseys, it seemed to be considered the neighborhood joint - which doesn't happen much in Montgomery County - at least not like Chicago from whence I came.  All in all, it turned a cranky girl into a happy one, and will definitely go back when its time for beers, bar food and great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=180

Richard F.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",15,49,69,3.0,3/1/2011,"Some Fridays are better than others.  This happens to be one of the good ones.  I came here with my kids and their friends, so we had a rather large party of 5 for a busy Saturday night.  Nevertheless, we were seated in about 15 minutes, and our waitress was very nice and brought us our menus.  The kids menu had chicken tenders, so that's what they ordered.  I tried the Jack Daniels steak, which was actually not bad, and pretty large.  It was a little undercooked (I asked medium well, and it was pretty bloody), but I ate it anyway, and it was good.  It came with a side of fries, which were limp so I didn't really want to eat them.  The kids enjoyed their meals, and it's a good spot to go with fussy kids because they'll find something they'll like.  They have a large, creative menu, and if you're a drinker, they have many unique drinks to try.  The food is not outstanding but it's better than average, and the service is good, so it's not a bad choice, at least as far as Rockville is concerned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=180

As we stood and waited yet another minute as he waited until the host returned. I was rushed to decide what I wanted to eat. Thank god the food was the best part of the experience, it was nice and hot and cooked to my liking. The service, I thought at first maybe she just wants to make sure we are okay and stay attentive but it started out overwhelming and like a rush then it was cold turkey because our server disappeared. I had to get up to ask that same manger for the check and a box. What an event that was in it self. This man was almost as bad the server and hostess. Finally our server Emily returns with the check and attentively watches me put our money in the booklet, of course as we walked away she was all of a sudden around again because he surely was quick to pick up the book and say goodbye.

Connie M.,"Rockville, MD",290,203,507,2.0,6/5/2014,"TGIFriday's has always been the go-to for late nite munchies! The best thing is you have 2 happy hours...first one during the after work hours and a second one starting at 10pm until close!!! That means almost everything is $5 or half off. Yum! The menu has changed a bit. They now have a ""little bites"" menu too. Tapas at Fridays. Um. Ok.  I was going to get a burger but decided to try 3 little things. I started with the Thai pork tacos from the little bites menu. They were not kidding when they said ""little"" bites. As a woman, I finished one of these tiny tacos in 2 bites but let's be honest...you can do it in one. The flavor was o.k. but at $7 I did not think there was value for my money. As it was Tuesday, everything Jack Daniels is $5. Drinks and 3 menu items. I like the sauce so I decided on the sesame jack chicken strips. They were more like long nuggets instead of strips. They were perfectly fried and nicely sauced. Best thing I ordered...but did the serving get smaller because the price did? Let's be honest. I love me some tater skins. I pretty much watched the clock to get to Fridays for the late night happy hour just for some fried wedges of potatoes loaded with cheese, bacon, scallions and sour cream!!! .......WTF??? (Mom, that is ""what the fridays???) Some wacko decided to play around with the perfect bar food (next to buffalo wings) and they re-vamped it into some sad lump that Taco Bell wouldn't even serve!  First they mashed the potato and formed it into a triangular yet curved form. Why? Then they fried it up and even though it sound like it would be a delicious potato pancake, it was a dried up, crumbly, messy lump. Then, they put processed cheese in the middle. Huh? I like processed cheese but not on a tater skin. I saw bacon but no scallions. At least there was sour cream. So, most of the yummy elements were still there. I cut off a piece and it crumbles. I spear it with the fork and half falls off. The trick is to pick it up with your fingers.  Bottom line is it does taste yummy. But why mess with perfection? A hollowed out potato half, flash fried and covered with shredded cheddar, bacon and chives. A cute little boat waiting to be topped with sour cream. Fridays...blasphemy!  I may be back for 3 buck Thursdays....but when Chili's right down the street has happy hour from 2pm to 8pm I really don't see the point. Overpriced happy hour food and inattentive service at the bar? Grab some beer at Dietle's and taco bell instead. ps. This was tough for me to write as most of my reviews are positive and 4 stars.

Okay cool, he said no prob and walked away... And then came back within a minute and asked if we were ready. Same answer, walked away again.

Not bad, but not good either. I ended up not finishing my plate, my friend seemed to like his burger but that's hard to mess up.

Even leaving tonight there were 2 employees at the exit when leaving, talking to each other, failing to offer the standard 'goodbye' one would get at other locations.   The place (bar area) is dirty and in need of someone managing the building who cares.  The food is consistent with other Friday's, so at least they have that going for them. That gets them the 1 star.  I guess if you are looking for a great place to socialize while working with no accountability, you should definitely get a job here.

Christian M.,"North Bethesda, MD",82,46,24,2.0,9/27/2011,"The bar honestly saves this place. It's everything that's wrong with the big box places. The service is decent depending on who you have. The food is what bothers me the most though, Premium prices for a non-premium product. Wish they had better and smaller bar foods/ prices. Anywho, as I said before the bar really saves this place. The bartenders are pretty friendly and attentive for the most part. This place is open later than most bars in the general area so you get a ton of regulars late at night. The drink specials are why I'm giving this place a higher rating than I should. Pretty good, though the best beer they have on draft is the magic hat. Overall the bar area is wayyyy too small, especially compared to the one in Tech Road in Silver Spring. That place is huge in comparison!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=120
William S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",19,73,5,1.0,3/19/2012,I love Fridays but this location is miserable.  The food is rushed.  The place is dirty and the quality is sub standard.   You normally know what you are getting with a chain but not with this one.   This one time I sent back some pot stickers because they were burned.   They immediately brought them back out re plated with fresh greens and flipped over to hide the burned food.   It was then I just begged to leave but had to endure them trying to make things right.   My burger with management attention came out wrong and my wife's food was wrong as well.   This place herds you in like cattle which is fine but it can't handle the crowd. Even when I left hungry it took 20 minutes for the manager to comp our check so we could leave.  This is not the first time we have been miserable here.   Go to a different Fridays.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=120
Taice M.,"Silver Spring, MD",106,31,10,1.0,2/4/2014,"I made the biggest mistake tonight and forgot my work phone on my table when I left this restaurant!  the table had not been bust yet when I left.  I made it home and called my work phone while I was looking for it. and it rang because the phone it at full energy! so i decided to call the restaurant and inquire about the phone and they said they didn't have it.  As soon as i got off the phone with Fridays, I called the work phone again and OMG, it has been turned off!!!! obviously by someone who has been made aware that I'm looking for my phone and I know its still in the restaurant. So i go to the restaurant and everyone seemed concerned, the manager was very nice, the funny thing is that the one person who i assumed would have asked me if i was ok or checked on me would have been my server but no, she never spoke, at all.  even though she walked pass me 3 times! she never said a word!  how strange is that!!!!!!!!  So my point is, dont ever leave your phone behind and assume that people are as kindhearted and thoughtful as you are because they are not.  yes it was my mistake and i will never forget it! luckley the phone is insured and i am getting a replacement but thats not the point!  Oh and good luck using my fingerprint to use the phone!

Dan P.,"Olney, MD",1,3,,2.0,4/8/2013,"So, I went here maybe a few months ago, and I just did not like it at all. I have no clue if they changed since I went because I will never set foot in that place again, but this is when I went. The service was decent, wasn't the best because there were always delays in getting drinks, and the food. Not to mention, this is not family friendly. Well, it is but it is LOUD. So loud I literally had to raise my voice to the point of yelling to talk to my brother and mother. I'm not the ""bar"" type guy so maybe it is me that just doesn't like the place. If you like loud places, and alright service, definitely go...but if you like it calm and a more friendly environment, go somewhere else..not worth your money. Not to mention, not the best lit place. Hopefully this helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=120
Ben S.,"Silver Spring, MD",30,137,278,2.0,7/23/2011,"Not a bad restaurant, but too much money for what you get.  If the price point were a few bucks lower, then it would get a higher rating. That said, the service was good, the atmosphere was good, the food was all right, but it was just a bit more expensive than it should be for the type of operation being run here. In short: not bad, but overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=120
Mariah J.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,6,1,5.0,11/16/2014,"I visited this T.G.I Fridays on a Saturday afternoon with my Bestfriend who I had not seen in months. Our visit lasted for about 5 hours but we enjoyed every hour we spent there. Our server was Bobby and he provided outstanding service. He was very attentive, friendly and he knew his products.Our food was delivered promptly and was cooked perfectly. I was also impress to see that the service manager Kevin took time visit each table to insure their dining experience was going well. Kevin also recommended that we try their delicious caramel salted cake dessert. This dessert was beyond delicious. I would highly recommend anyone to check out this location you cant go wrong with friendly staff and well cooked food.

Chris H.,"Rockville, MD",6,27,,1.0,6/23/2010,"I like to find the good in almost any restaurant I go to. However, this TGI Fridays is the nastiest place in the area. The waiting staff is TERRIBLE, the food is TERRIBLE, it's not very clean, and did I mention how terrible the food is? Yes, I have been to TGI Friday's and have had some ok experiences. But having gone to this one I have pretty much sworn this place off forever. FOREVER! This is a chain restaurant at its WORST. After waiting forever for our waitress, who didn't seem like she even wanted to be there, I made the mistake of ordering fish and chips (I was hungry dammit!). What I ended up receiving were larger than average fish sticks that were dark brown and looked like they had been soaked in oil accompanied by soggy fries. Notice I said ""soaked"" and not ""fried"". Despite how disgusting they were I actually took a bite. Bad idea. As much as I hate doing it, I sent the food back and decided not to order anything. Another bad idea since the waitress proceeded to beg me to order something else. So I ordered something else, which was better but still less than adequate. I didn't even finish it, and when I don't finish the food it's BAD. The moral of this story is, if you like chain restaurants, live in a double wide and think Old Country Buffet is fine dining, go to this place because you will feel right at home. If you like food that is a.) edible and b.) edible, you definitely want to look elsewhere. Just keep driving down Rockville Pike until you see another restaurant. There are so many around here you will forget about this one as soon as you pass it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=140

We decided to go here based on all the advertising on TV about their 2 for $20 special. (2 appetizers + 2 entrées for $20) It did NOT disappoint! Ok, so it's a bit noisy on a Saturday night with all the people at the bar watching the College games on TV, but the food is fantastic! Service was very prompt despite the place being busy.

Keith H.,"Montgomery Village, MD",0,2,,1.0,12/22/2014,I went to fridays on friday december 19 to celebrate my birthday dinner with friends. I was not satisfied. The food was mediocre at best. The waitress was nice but I barely saw her. I didn't get my drinks until 15 mins after ordering them. I didn't get the food til 1 hour. And it wasn't even that good! I for one will never be attending that restaurant again. Waste of my time and money. I suggest a better chef.

Niket R.,"Rockville, MD",8,108,,3.0,9/4/2010,"I came here last Thursday to get a snack while taking a break from Reading at the nearby Barnes and Noble. I ordered the Key West Shrimp, which consists of two skewers of marinated (but it still was a bit bland) shrimp and a side of steamed broccoli. The meal was tasty enough, but more importantly fit within the parameters of my diet (something along the lines of a paleolithic diet). The service was pretty decent as well; I sat at the bar and the food arrived within ten to fifteen minutes.  The place was packed even on a Thursday Night, so I'd come here for lunch if I'm coming with company and anyone in my party is not in mood to wait in line to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=140

Lauren B.,"Manhattan, NY",169,434,42,3.0,10/26/2010,"Now anyone who knows me knows I don't do the chain restaurant thing if I can help it but I have one good friend who feels a certain sense of security in sameness so I always end up at a chain restaurant with him. In addition, this person does not see the lure of DC night life so we always end up in the 'burbs. Please trust that this person has some redeeming qualities.  Anywho, Friday's is getting a solid three stars because they have some pretty awesome late night deals for those people who don't value sleep and don't mind going to work drunk. Its like a happy hour for the despondent. $2 Oktoberfest and something like 25 cent wings is worthy of something, isn't it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=140
Irene H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",134,22,3,3.0,12/17/2009,"Its a good place to meet friends after work for cheap drinks, decent bar food and watch the game (with pop music playing over it). The bar runs a happy hour from 5 - 7 and 10 - close. Beers are either $2 or $3, a few of their mixed drinks were $4 (long island ice teas, margaritas, mojitos, and a few other drinks that I can't remember), and all appetizers (excluding the samplers and sliders) are priced half off. Wings were good, the Sesame Jack Chicken Strips tasted better than they looked, and the Loaded Potato Skins were satisfying. Service was good, although we're pretty sure they haven't learned all of their signature drinks (those overpriced girlie fruit drinks) since one of them didn't look anything like the picture in the menu. BTW, the pumpkin martini & punk pink are both very good. You're not going to get anything extraordinary here, but if you want just a cold drink and a quick bite, Friday's is a safe option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=140

Beverage service sucked - we had to wait 10 minutes for a refill, even though she kept passing our table.

Dennis S.,"Brookeville, MD",5,15,,1.0,1/5/2010,"After writing several restaurant reviews, I began to wonder whether there was any restaurant that deserved a ONE STAR rating. I thought about this for some time before coming up with TGI Friday's in Rockville. The place is clean enough. The food is passable (in more than one respect). The parking is fine. The atmosphere is what you might expect. The one thing this place lacks that eclipses all else is the service. The service sucks. I had a bad experience here several years ago during a family event (bad service, long waits) but decided to give it another chance. That second chance was worse.  The hostess sat us around the corner in a quiet booth, seemed nice. As we waited for a waiter, an employee kept walking by, disappearing into a rear stall, reappearing a few minutes later to return to work. This happened a few times over 30-40 minutes. Yeah, we waited to long but after a while it became a question of: ""How long can they really ignore us?"" Finally, frustrated that no one had even taken our order, I went to inspect the stall and found that the employee was visiting the rear stall to hork down a few quick bites during downtime. We then tracked down a different host (the first one had vanished) and discovered that we'd been seated in a ""closed area"" and the chowing employee never thought to alert someone that we were there.  This review might be a bit unfair. The restaurant management has likely changed in the last 5+ years since this event. Regardless, I have not been back to a TGI Friday's since and I doubt I ever will. You can't pay me (well, maybe you could) to deal with that sort of service. I didn't deserve it and they don't deserve my business. Maybe if they could give me a 40 minute life refund...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockville?start=140
