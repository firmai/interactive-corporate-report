45,Xela N.,"North Olmsted, OH",7,207,,4.0,2016-12-13,"Let's face it.  It's hard to impress 'the average Joe' these days when it comes to new dining establishments.  There is so much competition, especially when it comes to overpriced (my opinion) national chains, thus expectations are ultra high to begin with.  Really, all people want is good quality, good tasting food at fair prices.  My wife and I had been driving by the BJ's location as it was being built, wondering what kind of restaurant would be replacing 'Smokey Bones'.  We stopped by on opening day, and frankly left unimpressed.  My wife had the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which she thought was OK, but the veggies and rice were very bland in taste.  I had the Ahi Poke as my appetizer, which was gross to say the least.  The 'poke sauce' tasted rather anemic, and the tuna was bland and flavorless, and seemed to be a 'lower grade'.  It's consistency was 'way off' as well, being very soft and limp.  Which makes me wonder if it was actually tuna at all I was eating, or some other cheap seafood filler masquerading as real tuna.  At this point, I thought to myself, well at least my medium deep dish pizza is going to taste great.  Wrong!  The dough was way too chewy in spots, and clearly not baked or crispy enough.  The cheese and tomato sauce tasted processed and bland as well.  I've tasted much better frozen pizzas, truth be told!  I took the pizza home anyway, and tried re-baking it, and added my own mozzarella cheese and spices.  It tasted much better.  At least the Pizookie desserts tasted great.  On the plus side, the interior layout is top notch, with a nice mix of bar, tables, and booths.  Our server was excellent too, as was the manager, who listened to my concerns, and ultimately 'made things right'.  I will probably give this place another chance in the future, but not anytime soon. 2/21/17 We returned to this location, and gave BJ's another chance, and it turned out much better.  The shrimp tacos and calamari were good, and our server was amazing!  My guests and I had a great time, and everyone left happy.  All I can say is that if you've ever had a bad experience at a new place, go back again and give them another chance at a later date.  Oftentimes, it takes a few weeks for a new place to find it's mojo, and reach optimal service and potential.  I hereby change my original 2 star review to 4.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=60,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001
79,Bob J.,"Elyria, OH",0,8,,2.0,2016-12-13,"BS over priced chain.  Beer is good but over priced.  No samples allowed, a mouthful will cost you just to try before you commit to a full.  I'm not impressed.  It's just a copy of Yard house or other chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001
70,Mike K.,"North Olmsted, OH",44,58,,3.0,2016-12-14,"The atmosphere is very friendly, energetic bar atmosphere, the menu is about 2"" thick offering pretty much any type of food you'd like. You can definitely get the ""chain style restaurant vibe"" the menu is too large to be all fresh food, I'd imagine a lot of it is frozen. The service was bad, but I won't judge them off that due to the fact they just opened 24 hours ago past my visit. The beer menu is pretty large, offering many local craft beers along with your typical ""commodity brands"". The beer that BJ's brew is decent, I personally expected mediocre beer from them since they are a chain. The menu also includes healthy variants that can be substituted for regular beef & breads. There's nothing you will get from here that you can't find at any other chain restaurant. BJ's reminds me like Yard House, it's classy higher end than an Applebee's. All in all I'd definitely go back just because it's nice to have a bar that offers more craft beers that is nearby where I live.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003
47,John D.,"Cleveland, OH",0,4,,5.0,2016-12-15,"I've been to BJ's elsewhere and enjoyed them, so I was happy to see one open locally. I stopped in yesterday, and it's the first week of opening, so I'm sure things are still shaking out. In spite of that, service was very attentive. Food and drinks arrived quickly, and we had an enjoyable experience. In terms of the beer - I tried both of their seasonals - Grand Cru and Bourbon Barrel Stout. I enjoyed both, but the Bourbon Barrel was the superior of the two, IMO. They also brew their own NA root beer, and it's got a very flavorful blend of seasonings.  In terms of food - We did salads and the pizza. Yes, the menu's a mile thick, but if you go here and it's not for pizza, you've made a poor choice. Their pizzas are excellent. I prefer the deep dish, but the thin crust is more than passable. They also have a GF option, which I'm told is excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=60,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004

52,Carrie K.,"Olmsted Township, OH",27,6,,4.0,2016-12-18,"We've been anxiously awaiting another dining option after Smokey Bones closed so we tried BJ's for lunch only a few days after opening. First impressions were bland. The restaurant was loud and somewhat overcompensating on staff. (I don't need a refill on my drink when it is 3/4 full). We had pretty much counted this one out after our food took forever, however once it did we changed our mind.  We ordered a burger for me (no bun, declined the gf free bun) and he got the pulled pork. I will say that was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. It was a bit greasy, but I was not ordering a burger to be healthy anyway. My husband really enjoyed the pulled pork and we both loved the fries. The prices were reasonable and we left happy. I will probably wait awhile until the staff is better trained, but I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=60,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736
50,Debra S.,"Westlake, OH",2,46,3.0,3.0,2016-12-21,"We've been to the Polaris BJ'S many times, so we were excited to see one go up at Great Northern. Decided on take out given the holiday shopping parking extravaganza.  Very disappointing.  The app to order pizza is confusing. We thought we were ordering 5 Cheese Pizza, but we got no cheese. Just crust with tomatoes.  The Caesar salad for $10.50 was pitiful. A couple handfuls of romaine, a few croutons and a very light sprinkle of cheese. The boneless wings were soggy, and food was cold. Apparently, no one figured out that the baked potato takes longer to make than the sandwiches and fries. Everything was done, but we had to wait 10 mins for the potato. We won't do take out there again. Too bad, because the food dining in, at least at Polaris, is always good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=60,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

It was around 10:15am and workers were arriving and she walked in and said she just need to pick up some gift card, they said they're closed and to come back at 11am.

From the hostesses to the servers, no one presented themselves in a customer-friendly way. After more than an hour in the restaurant, I finally received my food...only to be brought something that wasn't what was ordered. Given my positive experience with other BJ's, I'll give them another chance.

35,Cortney M.,"Lakewood, OH",49,10,,1.0,2016-12-26,"The Monday half-priced deep dish pizza was amazing. However, the service was terrible.  We waited almost forty minutes for our food and after our leftovers were boxed, it took over thirty minutes to get our correct check. The entire agonizing experience was almost two hours. The waitress also bumped into me with her tray, multiple times.  When you start a new with lunch specials and end with ""have a good evening,"" there's a big problem.  BJ's might be great in a few months, but they certainly have kinks to work out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=20,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006
49,Nicholas S.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,2016-12-26,The deep dish pizza is actually pretty tasty. We had the spicy Hawaiian and I really enjoyed it. The service was abysmal. Lunch took almost 2 hours. Most of the time was waiting on our checks which were wrong. The server didn't understand the daily special on pizza. This may be a function of the new staff but is unacceptable as is.

72,Michaela C.,"Cleveland, OH",0,6,1.0,2.0,2016-12-28,"I wanted to like them but nothing went right. The worst is when you give management feedback and they don't respond. Our beer was flat from the get go. Upon acknowledgement of that they have us new beers. But later we realized we were charged for the noncarbonated beers. When we complained our server told us there was nothing she could do. We attempted to escalate but it would have been the third time we spoke with management so there was no point in waiting. Our food took forever. We had the kids so we ordered theirs first, shortly after our app and then our food. Their food looked and was excellent hence the 2 stars. Wish I could give more on that account. Our food forever took another 30 mins for a super basic/cold queso app. And then another 40 mins after that for our food, a California flatbread and spicy pig tavern pizza. His actually looked great. Mine had more brown avocado than green. It was just frustrating to try and explain to management the slow service and food and just have them stare with no response. Seems like super young and inexperienced staff all throughout from management, servers and kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.952000000000001
23,Kerry A.,"Lakewood, OH",86,106,92.0,5.0,2016-12-30,"BJ's Brewhouse is exactly the type of place that this area needs. Located right in front of a mall, all you usually see here are chain restaurants that all feel the same. BJ's is different though. With a huge menu and a great selection of beers, you really can't go wrong here!       I have heard a lot of hype about this place recently, as it just opened, so I had to try it for myself. Being in front of a mall, parking was a nightmare. I drove around and turned around 3 times in mall traffic before I finally gave up and made my own parking spot. Once we got inside, the place was decently crowded but we were seated right away.       There is plenty of seating inside, an outdoor patio for warmer weather, and a decent sized bar. The atmosphere is very comfortable and what you might expect from a brewhouse. The hosts and our server were all very friendly, so no complaints there. While we were eating, food runners came up to us two times with food that wasn't ours (before we ordered, just meant for another table). I chalk this up to just opening and serves not yet having the hang of the table numbering. Nothing major.       As for food, they have pretty much anything you could want. We started with the spinach artichoke dip which was delicious. It came with tortilla chips and was exactly what I wanted. My mom and I both ordered a soup and salad combo, with tomato basil soup in a bread bowl (2.75ish surcharge). The soup was delicious and the bread bowl was amazing. The top of it was toasted and tasted like garlic bread. On the side, I got a Caesar salad and my mom got the wedge salad. Both were very good.       They have a great selection of house brewed beers, as well as cocktails and many other drinks. I went for their house brewed IPA and was very pleased. It was very smooth and went well with the food I was eating. Overall, this was a great experience and I will definitely be back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=20,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000007

I'm betting if they don't close due to lawsuits within a year, they'll be lucky. The food was bland and greasy. My boyfriend tried a burger which was oily from top to bottom- even the lettuce was soggy. I had the chicken club and did not like the garlic bread, which was also soggy upon arrival at the table.

60,Shawn K.,"Elyria, OH",0,4,1.0,1.0,2017-01-29,"Average chain restaurant trying to be disgusted as a micro brew pub!  Service was very slow and although I wanted to like our waitress Amber, she did a mediocre job at best.  My beer should not stay empty for over ten minutes before asking if I want another.  Several tables seated after us received their food before we did.  There are carpet runners throughout entire place because the tile floor is so slippery.  Menu is large and my Mahi Mahi tacos were extremely good, unfortunately the chips that came with were swimming in grease and a big let down.  What really put me over the edge of not wanting to go back was the wannabe hipster manager with the beard that walked out from the kitchen chewing on food and wiping his mouth while carrying some customers food, very gross and borderline disgusting!  The decor at first glance looks great but after you sit for a few minutes you notice everything is so fake and a really cheaply done.  The fake brick wall paper, is well, fake brick wall paper.  Very cheesy!  I am really let down because I was so looking forward to going.  Pricing was reasonable, although I'd rather pay a few dollars more and go to a real micro brew pub.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7560000000000002,3.0400000000000005
33,Jess F.,"Strongsville, OH",41,154,454.0,4.0,2017-01-29,"We have been a huge fan of the BJ's franchise in Columbus and despite the negative Yelp reviews were looking forward to trying this location too. We arrived on Saturday night at 6pm and the place was packed and we were told about an hour to 90 minutes for a table for 2.  Pretty typical when you don't make reservations on a Saturday.  Luckily while we were grabbing drinks from the bar 2 seats opened up.  We ordered avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, a  crispy jalapeno burger, and parmesan crusted chicken.  After about 20 minutes our dinners showed up and we told the food runner we were still waiting on our appetizers - a few minutes later our appetizers arrived.  The bartender came over to apologize and then sent the manager over to apologize - and ended up  taking off one of the appetizers from our bill which I thought was a nice way to handle the situation. The stuffed mushrooms were just Ok - probably a 2 star item.  They were bland and no particular flavor stood out.  The avocado egg rolls were fantastic & I would recommend.  I loved the crispy jalapeno burger - 5 stars - (Fried jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, Baja sauce, red onions, tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro on a toasted bun) and it was cooked to perfection.  The parmesan crusted chicken - 5 stars - (Topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli). We also tried the skinny margarita (5 stars) and you can't go wrong with any of their in house craft beers.  If you download the app and join their loyalty program you receive a free pizookie! I would recommend downloading the app to add your name to the waitlist before arriving to the restaurant.  We never got the text that our table was ready until we were in the car on the ride home - thankfully those 2 spots opened up at the bar or we would've been waiting the full 90 minutes. Side note for those with gluten sensitivities - I did notice many items were gluten free & they did offer gluten free buns for $1 up charge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.056,3.1200000000000006

The pictures at the top are just what our meals looked like when served so I think they represent very closely the look of all the meals served.   Tho the restaurant was not crowded, as others have noted, finding a parking spot within 3 aisles of either side of BJ's is near impossible with the mall entrances so close.  We finally found a spot near the shopping center entrance on brkpk rd.   Our server must be new as she couldn't answer some of our questions on drink prices or menu items. Food was presented in a reasonable time after we placed our order.  The menu is a tome about the size of war and peace...and took us a bit to look it over. Meanwhile our server kept coming back every couple of minutes asking if we were ready to order.  I guess she thought we'd been here before and would know what they offered.

4,Bob L.,"North Ridgeville, OH",446,372,2924.0,4.0,2017-05-03,"I can still remember the first experience I had at a BJ's Restaurant. It was in Arlington, Texas back in 2008. I wasn't nearly as big of an annoying beer snob back then and, more importantly, I wasn't so hung up on eating healthy food. This made BJ's a pretty damn good joint for me. My wife and I loved their pumpkin spice ale and the pizookie, c'mon, nothing that good should be legal. Anyway, fast forward to 2017, we're back in Cleveland, and we'd all but forgotten about BJ's. That is until we heard they were opening a location in North Olmsted. Gods be praised. (angelic choir, light beams). Yeah, yeah. It's a chain. We all get it. While I don't go out of my way to frequent chain restaurants, I also feel that if a chain is done right, there's nothing wrong with it. More of a good thing, right? And as far as chains go, BJ's is about as polished a concept as you're likely to find. Big menu, good beer, clean and modern design. We stopped in at this location around 5pm on a Wednesday with mild trepidation and vague recollections of pizookie-induced pancreatic spasms. We were also aware of everyone's complaints about wait times, so our expectations were managed accordingly. If you've never had a BJ's experience, one of the first things you'll probably notice is the sheer size of the place. It's pretty damn big. I hadn't noticed so much in Texas because, well, because everything in Texas is freakin' big, but in tiny Great Northern plaza, BJ's is a monolithic structure of epic proportions. It still has that new restaurant smell. We were greeted by a group of smiling young ladies as soon as we entered. We were told it'd be about 30 minutes our so. A quick assessment of the surroundings and we spied seats at the bar. Wait averted. BTW, the guy working the bar was a consummate professional. Service industry folks that take pride in their job and exude confidence and friendliness are a rarity. Celebrate (and tip well) when you encounter them. Our beers were always filled, our plates cleared toot sweet, and waters without asking. Overall, service was excellent. The beer. While it's not really brewed on site at each location (they own 6 breweries in 5 states) it is really tasty, expertly brewed and styled more toward the middle of the bell curve. They've got styles to suite just about every taste - pilsner, wit, stout, IPA, pale ale, hefeweizen - and they do seasonal and limited run beers like the aforementioned pumpkin ale. I've had just about every beer they brew and they are all solid. Annoying beer geeks may knock 'em, but seriously, I have no complaints in the libation department. Besides, they've won multiple Great American Beer Festival awards so they've gotta be doing something right. The menu here is sizeable but well laid out and organized with beautiful photography. It's like it has been scientifically designed to appeal to just about everyone and, lo and behold, they've even got ""enlightened favorites"" living happily next door to the usual, more indulgent suspects. Really, it all looks and sounds great, so you'll have trouble deciding. If it were in any way possible, I'd love to try everything. We had a pizookie in our sights, so we tried to eat conservatively. Here's a rundown of our selections: Twisted BLT Salad: Probably the most disappointing dish of the meal. Baby spinach, diced tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles tossed in honey sriracha vinaigrette and topped with smoked bacon and chopped hard-boiled egg. It tasted OK, it just wasn't tossed, stingy on the dressing, and the goodies seemed in short supply. Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts: Tossed in the same/similar slightly sweet & spicy dressing as the Twisted BLT Salad, most of the sprouts were cooked properly, a nice char throughout. Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms: Mini bellas stuffed with spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Yum. These poppable apps were delicious. The lemon pesto sauce really brightened them up. Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl: I know. Way too healthy. The chicken was roasted perfectly, a nice crispy, spicy crust. The quinoa was tender, well-seasoned and plentiful, but the bed of spinach was raw instead of the advertised sauteed, the mushrooms were also nearly raw, and the ratios were just off. Enlightened Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos: The roasted salmon was cooked perfectly, the maple cumin glaze was tasty albeit quite sweet, and the broccoli slaw and candied pecans (more sugar) added nice textural elements. The side of seasonal bistro grains was OK - a cold salad of quinoa, black beans, tomatoes, corn and cucumber. The pita shells are also quite hefty, so I'm not really sure how ""enlightened"" this dish is. Tasty though. The Pizookie (small version, perfect for 2) - If you haven't had a Pizookie you haven't lived.

I have been to a few bjs that have been incredible both food and service.   Today was some of he worst service I have had in a very long time. I went there today with a girlfriend and my 2 daughters. We wanted to honor our girls day tradition of getting to have dessert before our meal.  We sat down in a not to busy restaurant only to wait 15 mins to even have our server show up to great us. That is where she left one small drink napkin. We ordered our drinks and our dessert. She returned with drinks and quickly left to tend to the table of four business men behind us. Our dessert came and we only hand the spoons given to us to eat with and a single tinny napkin to clean two small children with. Then my friend decided that she wanted a berry hibiscus tea which I guess just came out today. The tea was totally forgotten then when we asked about it there was major attitude like she never ordered it, but it was the server who forgot about it The sunset peach and the berry tea were so bland with little to no flavor. We got our appetizer and still had no napkins or silverware. By the time we finally got them our avocado egg rolls were very cold. Food came and was missing things or had things we requested not to. The Mediterranean chicken pita tacos were ordered with on onion and came with them. My salad the BBQ chicken chopped salad came with no dressing at all. We finally got the manager and asked for her to help correct the wrongs. We told her that we were sorry to bother her but our server did not seam to be able to attend to us. The manager said sorry and that was it. By then I was just ready to leave. The server came with the check. She had to swipe the card at the table and leave to retrieve our paper to sign. She was gone like 5 mins. The manager stopped once more and asked how it was we responded with ok I guess. And she left again. We left and stopped the manager once more on our way out. We told her that the food was ok and the service was the worst since our server wanted to ignore us and pay attention to the businessmen. She said well come back and see me again ask for me then as an after thought gave me her name. I can tell you that im not rushing back. I fell like I could have lit my money on fire and gotten more pleasure from that then spending it here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.404,3.3200000000000003

I had the jalapeno burger and sweet potato fries and can't complain at all. The sauce that was on the burger was amazing and I could have used more of that, but the burger was cooked just like I wanted it and the fries, which I normally don't finish, were gone because they were awesome. The others at my table also enjoyed their meals. It was a Sunday afternoon/evening, so it was busy, but there were open tables so we were a little upset that we had to wait over 30 minutes for table but not enough to take this rating down.

We went there on their burger night and they simply could not do anything but char my burger after two attempts I said I'd just get something else. Third attempt mahi mahi tacos. Guess what that was overcooked too. This place just kind of is not great and is way over priced for what you get. It is unlikely I'll be back.  The place has exciting sounds and visuals. The server we had was wonderful and generally seemed to care about how much we enjoyed our experience. I do however echo some of the sentiments of other reviewers. The menu is huge which is good for choice, but you know all that stuff isn't made fresh. Also, it is a little pricey the ""Bj's"" brew i had was nearly six bucks. The food was ok.

He had to go get the chili to go with our queso because the kitchen didn't put much in but he made it right.  I got a flight of beers and it was good. Wife's mixed beverage was overpriced and weak.  Entrees were a big disappointment. Seared ahi tuna salad was half-heartedly slapped in a bowl and presentation looked like something I could have done at home. Tuna was chewy in several places and wasabi crust was not evenly distributed. I ordered this dish because I had it once before and it was awesome...not so much here.

Each subsequent visit has gotten worse. Today was the icing on the cake.  In for a very late (3 pm) lunch. Not very many patrons, plenty of wait staff. Seated for several minutes before the server came to our table. That's as good as the visit got. Lukewarm cheese sticks with about a tablespoon of marinara. We asked politely for more marinara, and my wife ordered a specialty tea. When the tea came, the glass was maybe 3/4 full. It was a basic iced herbal tea, and my wife wanted sugar. Okay, we'll ask when the additional marinara comes. Nope. No sign of marinara ten minutes later. No sugar (or salt and or pepper) at the table. Twenty minutes after ordering, we still haven't seen our main course, two hard-to-prepare salads. My wife was trying to be patient so we waited. Good thing, since our server was chilling against an empty table for at least ten minutes while we were waiting. It was apparently the thing to do. I like bucking the system, though.

30,Anne H.,"Cleveland, OH",0,8,,4.0,2017-09-26,"Enjoyed a nice meal this evening at Bj's. We make a point to go on Tuesdays for the wine specials. They have a good selection at half off. Our hostess greeted us warmly and really took time to seat us in an area that we preferred. Our server Ryan was top notch. Poured our wine with the skill of a sommelier. He was, accommodating. Checked on us throughout the meal without being intrusive. Genuinely kind person!!! It's a busy place  to be sure but the staff treat you Well!  The salmon was nicely seasoned and grilled right. The kale and Brussels sprout  salad is my favorite. They have hearty selections and terrific healthy selections too.

13,Patrick J.,"Lakewood, OH",85,24,26.0,2.0,2017-10-07,The manager reached out and wanted to make it right because the last visit here they were out of both the prime rib and pork chop. So about a month later I came back and tried ordering the prime rib again. This time I came at 730p on Saturday. They were out again hahahahahah. Its so hilarious I came in with low expectations so I wouldn't get upset.  I give up. :( By the way I ordered the pork chop this time because they weren't out yet.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

Both in the dining room and seated at the bar we have had great friendly service. The memu selection is huge! I haven't stopped raving about the Tomato amd Mozzarella salad since I had it! Also, as strange as this may sound,  the Hot Ham and cheese sandwich is the best I've ever had! The alfredo sauce on it gives it a unique twist and it really works! 4 stars only because my friend was brought the wrong food but they fixed the problem immediately and efficiently.

1,Gregg T.,"Cleveland, OH",29,63,33.0,3.0,2017-11-21,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is what I'm sure most of us have come to expect from one of these chain-type American brew houses; good, not great. If it were up to me, I would change the name to BJ's Brewhouse and Restaurant since the beers are definitely the stars of the show.  I went on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend and was later joined by a mutual friend. We say at the bar, had a couple of beers (their house IPA is really good) and dinner. The menu is too much. I chuckled to myself when the bartender said something to the effect of ""there's 120 different items on the menu, so we have something for everyone."" While I'm sure he's just towing the company line, we all know better. A large menu doesn't typically translate into great food. BJ's was no exception.  On the off chance that I was mistaken, however, I ordered the roasted shrimp Peruvian quinoa bowl. Trust me, I've been around the proverbial block a time or two, so I know better than to try to make a place something that it isn't, but I just had to see what would be served. In all honesty, it wasn't the worst ""entree"" that I've eaten in one of these types of places. The bowl came out with about a dozen shrimp piled on a bed of sauteed spinach, tomatoes and quinoa. While the dish had way too much lemon juice (or something?), and I'm sure the shrimp were frozen, and certainly overcooked, it really wasn't all that bad all things considered. I wasn't expecting a Michelin star dish or anything.  The service was friendly, the bartender attentive, and the vibe of the place was pretty good. It's a bit out of the way for me, so I don't expect to be back at time too soon, but that said, I would return, have a beer and maybe an appetizer or two. As for the rest of the menu, it's nothing out of the ordinary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

0,Sara W.,"Cleveland, OH",67,44,86.0,4.0,2017-11-30,"OK so I love beer and I love pizza, both things that BJ's has and, I think, does well. However, I've been here a few times and every time the service was slow and a bit scattered. Let me explain what happened this last time: I came here with one of my friends to have lunch before we went shopping at the mall one Sunday afternoon. The place was kind of busy but they had a lot of servers on the floor...it looked to me like each server maybe had 3 or 4 tables (I could very well be wrong here though). My friend was already waiting at our table with waters when I got there, and explained to me that our server would come back and take our drink orders once I was ready. I really don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that we waited for at least 10 minutes before she came back. When she came around, I asked her about this beer they had on special and asked if I could try it while my friend ordered a Fathead's Holly Jolly. Our server was more than happy to bring me a tasting of the special and I ordered it since it was delish! I really don't think i'm exaggerating again when I say that it was at least another 10 minutes until she came back with my drink, and at this point my friend had already finished hers. The downside to all of this is that we hadn't even ordered our food yet and we'd already been there at least 20+ minutes.  By the time we were able to order our food, we were starving and opted to each get a side salad and split a flatbread pizza...pepperoni on all of it and banana peppers on just half. BJ's is fancy and the servers are able to put in the orders on these touchscreen pads at the table so they go straight to the bar/kitchen. Now I don't know if our server put in the pizza wrong or if the kitchen just messed up but there was only pepperoni on half and banana peppers on half. Not a huge deal since I could've done without the pepperoni anyway. Now the salads: mine was a delicious garden salad that had an abundance of different veggies, while my friend ordered the caesar...it ended up being probably half the size of what mine was.  I know I could've given BJ's a 3-star rating for this experience, but I really do like their food (when it comes out right). The service is definitely on the slower side, even when they're slow (I know because I've been there when it's slow...and they're slow). I love the space of the place, especially in the summer time when the patio is open. I will definitely go back and enjoy something from their huge menu, but I will make sure to bring a little patience with me next time. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
