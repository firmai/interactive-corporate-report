"""System does not make sense: cashier overloaded with duties while expo does almoast nothing""",3.0," Sep 16, 2017",Past,Crew,,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Part-time,,The company has benefits and everyone is friendly. Would be a great college job if it wasn't for the cons I listed below,"The system doesn't make any sense. The cashier is overloaded with duties while expo doesn't do much at all. Now that I work there I understand why every chipotle dining room is so trashed all the time. Dirty tables and filthy bathrooms are a constant in every Chipotle anywhere. Now I understand why. It is because while the rest of the people on the line are only responsible for one task, the cashier is responsible for half of the responsibilities of the restaurant and he/she is not allowed to get help with such duties from any other worker (like zero common sense teamwork ). Besides having the regular responsibilities of a cashier, this position requires that you keep each table and counter clean in the dining room, also the bathrooms and floors, also wipe and stock trays, constantly stocking and restocking the dining room, ask customers if everything is great all that while having an endless line of people. Yes, I get the multitasking concept but it doesn't make any sense to put all these responsibilities on a one person while the rest of the employees on the line have one task only. Now I see why all Chipotles dining rooms and bathrooms are always so filthy while I see people just chilling on the line and while the cashier is always so busy and unable to complete the overload of expected duties. And yeap they all get paid the same.","I know you are a corporation and your system comes from above. But maybe it is time to take a look at your system because as a customer before I worked at Chipotle, my family and I would always be disgusted to have to eat on top of beans, rice and salsa spilled on dirty counters and tables, and we would never dare to use your always filthy bathrooms. Understand it doesn't make any sense to put so much responsibility on the cashier while the expo doesn't do much, and while there is so much need to keep the dining room and bathrooms clean and restocked. I don't know how this corporation and its managers so blindly follow this pointless system and no one dares to speak up. Or is it that every manager is so out of touch not to realize how messed up is to run a restaurant with always filthy dining room and bathrooms?? And how it just doesn't make any sense to expect the cashier to efficiently do all their tasks while others are not expected to do much and are not even allowed to help?? Some common sense from the management is desperately needed in that corporation"

If you are growing within the company you have a good idea of what to expect. If you are hired on as an external manger, this means you have some good management experience. It is impotent to know, the GM position is very different from most companies. The time given form the labor matrix will require you to spend many hours working the line, prep, grill, etc. I have seen them hire over 30 outside managers with in the last 3 years and only 3 are currently working for Chipotle.

"""Run for your life !!!!!!""",1.0," Aug 10, 2017",Past,Crew Member,"Los Angeles, CA",No,No,Neutral,Full-time,Less than a year,The food is actually great. If you work full time you can eat two full meals including the Chips and Guac ! That's about $22 right there. Co workers are very friendly as well as the customers. You get to go home with at least $2 in tips every day this will pay for half a gallon of gas ! So basically if you work here don't spend on food and your days off you get 50% off only and the restaurant you work at. Do not ask for discount at any other restaurant.,"Everything starts with the current economic system we have. It's all about profit. That's what the companies are for right ? So Chipotle is not the exception. The restaurant I worked at medium size sells about $7,000 a day this is about $221,000 a month ! Rent was only $15,000 and labor cheap. This is super good for Steve (the owner) and the investors. But really bad for the employees. From the moment you clock in you don't have a second to rest or else the managers will ask you to move fast, walk fast, there is a time for everything. No time to talk to nobody. You're allow to two breaks of 10 mins during the 8 hours you work but honestly nobody takes the first break. The other 10 is your lunch because you are starving at this time and you better finish your lunch in 10 minutes because there is a lot more work to do. I mean if this were your business and you were making $100,000 profit per restaurant this would be great ! But you're making minimum wage and at the end of the day you can't even walk or move your hands from all the repetitive labor. It's just not worth it. It is for the owner but not for the employees. You can work somewhere else and be seated comfortably with A/C for minimum wage. So again unless you are homeless and don't have any money to buy food at all. Nobody should work in here under the current conditions.","Let's be a little bit more generous. I'm not talking to the store managers, they have no decisions on the compensation plan. I'm talking to the Owner, if you are making billionsssssss has enough money for the rest of three more life's. Now is time to share the good life with your employees. The ones who are making you more rich every day. And many of the employees have two or three jobs cuz you can't live with $200 a week here in the US and pay rent and utilities and living expenses. The employees at Chipotle most of them are very smart or else they let you go the first week. Only the best of the best got to stay. So find the way to help them have a better life."

If you're on a ""short shift"" such as 4-9:30 you better believe you're not getting a break even if the law says you're supposed to after 5 hours of work.<br><br>Also, no matter what shift you're scheduled for (7:30am-3:30pm or 3:30pm-11:30pm) you're NOT getting off when the schedule says you will. So, if you're the type of person that can't handle working all night then getting up early for class, DON'T close.<br><br>In my opinion, Chipotle asks way too much of employees, and management treats these employees very poorly. Even though the pay is over minimum wage, and personally I received a raise even above that, I didn't feel it was worth the things I was put through by management. There's a tuition reimbursement program that offers up to $5200 every year that you work if you're enrolled in school. I kept pestering my managers about this when finally one day they told me I missed the ""deadline"" that I'd been asking about for weeks... I was miserable. $5000 extra for a college student is like winning the lottery... or really for anyone having that extra money would be extremely nice. When I finally decided to quit, I was told I'm ""dumb"" for going to college because I will be in debt anyways. I was also told by my GM and another manager that they ""make more money in a year than I ever will with my degree"" - LOL. Considering they spend 60-70 hours a week rolling burritos I'm pretty sure my salary will be nicer and require a lot less crappy work. Chipotle needs to not turn the other cheek anymore with all the complaints employees put out about management...there are countless reviews just like this one, so please don't take this as a bitter ex employee review. I loved working at Chipotle because of my coworkers despite the crap we went through, but after losing out on 5 grand because my managers were angry towards students for no reason I decided I had to leave for my sanity."

Now normally there should be a line backer that takes care of the lobby FOR the cashier but 3 out of the 5 days I work I have to do the lobby,ice, restock the drink station,(sometimes bag chips) and check people out.

I usually work from 10:15-5pm The slowest time of the day is around 3:30. We get about 3-10 customers around that time, therefore I attempt to take a break. I always ask my manager at around 4 for a break but she always says no. I have to clean the lobby first and refill the ice again and then i can eat. BUT WHILE I EAT I HAVE TO CHECK PEOPLE OUT AT THE SAME TIME!? I literally have to take like 3 bites then run to register and check people out and run back to my food. And my final con?

There will be a lot expected of you, so be ready to be on your feet, as those benefits they offer you do come with a price. Be fast, be perfect, or you're not a ""Top Performer"".<br><br>And real quick, in the food industry, you're going to deal with customers. They will test your patience, so hope you are already good with that. With that said, here's the con of Chipotle:<br><br>There's going to be many things the restaurant will teach you, and want you to to know and remember. And the main one you will hear is you becoming a ""Top Performer"". The definition of this is that you are supposed to help out your fellow Co-workers and elevate them to become, well, ""Top Performers"", the best workers so you guys can be efficient at your job.<br>-In reality its you going back and forth on two positions and trying your best to accomplish both. This becomes especially hard when the lunch rush hits.<br>An example will be being on Cash, and while that alone has some tasks for you to do (Like taking all orders, cleaning the dining room and bathroom), you must also help out the burrito station when customers are coming in. And now keep doing that at a quicker pace when the lunch rush comes in, and you're attempting to help your co-worker with the many customers he has on the Burrito station, while taking orders on the phone and gathering the Online Orders, AND having to help the customers who come to the Cash Register to get their online order.<br>Oh and once that's done you are told by your boss that the dining room is dirty, why didn't you do anything about it.<br><br>This was my first job, but from my understanding I thought that a person was assigned a job, and they had certain tasks they must do. A Janitor Cleans, A Cashier tends the customers, and a server makes the burritos. But Chipotle will make you be all 3 and slap on ""top performer"" to give it a valid excuse for you to do these. And even then I was forgiving, and do these tasks anyways. But what doesn't make up is the extra time I stay at work to finish the tasks that aren't necessarily mine, and the lectures I get that task X is not done correctly, when I had tasks A, B, C, D, E, F, G that they THEMSELVES told me to do as well. It's silly how they expect everything to be done fast, and without mistake.<br><br>I would like to say maybe it was simply my bad luck, that by chance it was just the location of my restaurant which made the tasks difficult (Mine was near a Baseball Stadium, as well as a train station in which many commute to and from work). But no matter what the location is, work is work, and Chipotle will be sure you are indeed doing just that, by making you work, and work fast in the Food Industry.","You got nice benefits that attract people such as College Students, but from my restaurant I seen many leave soon after. I understand that work is work, and shouldn't be challenging at times, but the ""top performer"" and the method used for lunch rushes should be revised and adjusted. You don't know how many times we have 6 people standing in the front doing nothing cause its ""rush"" and once its over we are swarmed with people but Oh, rush is over so its up to the 2 guys at Tortilla to figure it out.

With that however, If you make it here I am confident you can make it anywhere, you will learn to build a people culture by connecting with others and that is a skill that is useful in life in general. That is Chipotles main focus in their business, to develop their people (borderline selflessness) and through that the numbers (Sales, P&amp;L, Food Safety &amp; Ops Audit, etc.) will improve. It is an awesome fact that a majority of Chipotles GM's came from the bottom, like myself as a Crew member and it has probably the highest paying salary in comparison to other fast food restaurants. With that fact you don't need a bachelors witch is an awesome opportunity for those who cant afford school.","Chipotle will work you to the bone if you are not organized. As a salary manager you are free labor and unless you rule with an iron fist with a lot of organization you may get sucked into that vortex of being a super crew member. I feel a lot of that is determined by the demographic of people that work for you. the quality of workers in Princeton, NJ by be a better caliber than from Detroit, MI.","I feel Chipotle should shy away hiring external hires. As of right now I have an area manager that came from a retail store. I feel as though i am teaching him everything and along with that once i do teach him he micro manages me to the T.

Food quality has generally gotten better since the first round of policy changes but we compromised our values due to this scare by not taking care of your employees. It is no secret that not having enough hours available on the schedule is a problem at Chipotle nationwide. There are multiple petitions and Facebook pages appealing to the company due to this issue. I'm a numbers guy so I don't like how many changes there were that were not compensated or explained properly. If sales are down, tell me that the damn sales are down and why new policies will help. Also, do NOT expect a restaurant to be +3 - +5 over staffed as a standard when the company can't come up with 35 hours to give employees of 12 years. Start caring about your employees and management teams again and they will be much more motivated to do more work for the same amount of pay. Lastly, If you're going to trust someone with keys to the store, a safe code, and to open/close the restaurant as the only manager, you need to pay more than $12/hr after three years of loyalty.

The benefits though are fantastic, and it's definitely a place someone with no background can come in with an awesome attitude, and become a manager in a year or two.","I found the hours to be all over the place, and they are very strict on over time. This is the nature of the food industry though.","I think that Chipotle needs a lot more consistency between their different restaurants. The one I was in, was fantastic, and we got restauranteur, yet many of the other ones I've been in need a lot of love. Upper management needs to come in and push that restauranteur on each location, as it really encourages a fantastic work environment."

It is something that you can be proud of being a part of helping change lives: the farmers, employees, customers, and community.","They advertise that 98% of the leaders are developed from within the company. There is an extreme divide between the ""outside hire"" managers and the ""internal promote"" managers. Outside hires are not only not set up for success with training, but also are looked upon with a stigma as they did not ""achieve"" their status. In addition to that, when the leaders of the managers are also an ""outside hire"" they do not know how to train or lead their managers. If this is such a stigma and handicap, then outside hires should not be brought on the team. After the sub-par training takes place, and the manager is set into the role, they are then held to not only unrealistic goals, but there is not support from the leadership team to teach them how to achieve these goals. There is an extreme amount of favoritism, and if you are not liked on a personal level by the leadership, then you are given even less support and at the drop of a hat, you can be removed from the team. You are taught to train your team to believe in a goal that is much like reaching for a unicorn; no one has ever seen it, you don't know if it exists, and you have no idea how to attain it. You can work typically 65+ hours and still expected to be ""on call"" when you are not working. Having much experience in restaurant management, it is understood that position of a restaurant manager is very demanding; however, with this company, it had been the most strenuous both physically and mentally, with little to no reward or recognition. They claim to be up front an honest with everyone within the company, but they have many undisclosed motives and plans that are never shared until after the decision has already taken place. Leadership and directives change so often it is impossible to achieve what is asked of the managers, and there are continuous threats to terminate employment if perfection is not achieved.","Just say no to the position! The job was not worth the physical and mental stress which is unlike any other position as a restaurant manager I have ever encountered. There will be a lot of empty promises, and the ""deal"" will look unbeatable in terms of the ""culture"" and ""support"" that this company is supposed to provide that will seem very desirable during the interviewing process. The truth is that nine times out of ten, this is just not the case.

None of them realize that most corporate employees hate their jobs and are too scared to speak up. Being smart and hard working does not work here if you have your own opinions or a different way of doing things. I am sure Chipotle used to be great but everyone who disagreed either got pushed out or let go. This company says they want people to come as they are, but if you are outgoing and a people person you are deemed a low performer. The one on one culture is really just a gossip culture, and managers get each other riled up about people they don't even know or work with. All in all, very very very dissapointed with this supposedly cool company.","Take a step back and think about why you have such high turnover. Saying ""this is an intense place"" isn't good enough.

No matter how busy, or slow, I am always picking up the pieces that the other cashiers don't care to. From facing boxes,t o stocking, to even garbage cans. I am so swamped when I arrive that I, barely, get it all in place by the time that peak arrives. I have been yelled at by corporate for so much as being in the back, but how else am I going to make sure that it looks good, and things that we need like napkin boxes are open and ready for people to just grab as they pass by?<br><br>This leads me to the favoritism, and how I am treated when compared to the other cashiers that come through the store that day. I come into my shifts nearly forty minutes early, because I am so afraid that the place will be a wreck that I need the time to adjust, and mentally make a plan of action. I am constantly watching the morning or mid cashier just.. Standing, talking to customers for twenty minutes, or in the back having a powow with friends. This is allowed, not one person from management bats an eye, and when I ask for something to be done before I clock on, or for the previous cashier to check out and help me, I am greeted with sneers and a vanishing act, when I am looking away, or busy with something as simple as melting ice.<br><br>I am not the best, Chipotle has done its job to ensure that I have been beaten into the ground. I feel like I am taken advantage of. I long to see the light of morning cash shifts, but they are given to the people the managers sit in the office and talk to for forty minutes at a time, leaving myself and one other crew member utterly alone, and most of the time, swamped. They tell me what I want to hear, that II won't have to work closing cash(a shift that stresses me out so much, especially when I come in to a mid cash who absolutely does not care about me, that I cry before, during, and after), but turn around and schedule me for even more. They constantly take 'smoke breaks', or spend nearly a half an hour taking out the trash, but still, I am so terrified of not doing a good enough job, that I push myself to limits I never knew existed, and asking for help is a rarity.<br><br>They are favoritists, whoever pleases them the most gets their attention, aid, and preferential treatment with the schedule. From working nothing but nights the entire time I've been there, with a few morning cash thrown in, to requesting time months in advance so that I could attend an event to celebrate my fiances success in his career- They of course did not give it to me, and when I spoke to them, was told every day that they would 'work on it', up to the day before, leaving me to work the shift, dumbfounded, that I would be lied to for nearly a week, when they could have simply told me they did not care to even try to look at the schedule- A lie they tell me often.<br><br>We were late to a once in a lifetime event, Chipotle. And it was your fault.<br><br>Furthermore, an employee that used to work at the store, and had been through the restaurateur business returned, and on her first day, made it known that our standards had slipped, and took the time to point out, rather condescendingly, what we were doing wrong. For me, it was not seeing fast enough that II needed a bigger bag, or the marker tip being pushed in too far- She did not try to hide the fact that she regards us with an upturned nose. All of the managers could do nothing but talk about how good she is at her job, how her cash shift was perfect. I pick up shifts. I pick up slack. I work through every social anxiety I am plagued with to show up for work. I am constantly working nearly an hour late, because I hold myself to high standards, even when I am so overwhelmed from the lack of consideration from the rest of my cash team that I don't know whether I can show up to work the next day.<br><br>Management realized we were frustrated with how condescending the new coworker was, and pulled us all aside.. To tell us that she was right, that they needed to be harder on us. It opened a pandoras box of issues, and when approached with the feeling that one other cashier and I felt we were held to higher, impossible standards, while the rest got to do whatever they wanted to while they waited for me to arrive and do what they did not want to do, were told:<br><br>That sounds like a personal problem, and if we did not meet standards, our final checks could be ordered that second.<br><br>Do you know, how exhausting this is? I don't expect HR to understand, hiding behind their desks- Gosh, I can't even find the right HR number to call, I can only assume that people like Steve Ellis only care about success, and turn a blind eye to abuse and mistreatment.<br><br>This job is exhausting. This job is not worth the amount of money, or effort that I put in to it, But I show up every day because I am afraid to leave them a cashier short, especially when we have been so low on people for so very long,.<br><br>But I am beginning to feel like its an abusive relationship, like every time I want to get away, it pulls me back in with guilt, and a promise of change.<br><br>I am so burnt out, with no rainbow, or bright light on the horizon, and I am so tired of my voice not being heard.<br><br>Save yourself the dread, and the tears, and the defeat that I feel on a daily basis, and do not work here.",

Paid breaks.,"The company tries to inspire really hard according to its ""Atlas Shrugged"" philosophy. Almost all of the people that advanced really fast at the company were ex criminals that were favorited by our 'restauraunter' who is like a glorified general manager, who was also an ex criminal. They loved giving people second chances; but fired me because i was a student and not someone with a ""story"" as they liked to call it. Though we were told to repeat and memorize what makes a ""top performer"" which is the thing to be when always at chipotle. A top performer is influenced by their circumstances to achieve the knowledge of high standards and with these high standards you become empowered and influence those around you. This certainly did not apply when half of the managers would show up stoned and or drunk to work. I apparently received ""spiritual guidance"" from a district manager aka a 'patch leader' and that my path really included following my boss' orders. This was borderline cult creepy. I worked for as long as i did because i worked on campus where i went to school and took 14 credits a term with a baby on the way and used public transportation; other than all the ludicrous surrounding the burritos, the job was simple and convenient to get to. Despite the fact that i had received a raise, had a child, and graduated all the while i worked there... I was fired and not given a reason. Through the grapevine i heard our boss got docked for being a ""low performer"" and to save her butt she vocalized that she was sick of having students work there. Two weeks later all the students were dropped, including me who only got dropped because i had expressed interest in using chipotle's new tuition reimbursement program to continue my education. They only really like to hire people who want to compete with others to be managers, the turnaround at my store was insanely high, i saw new faces every week. The culture is corrupt, the pay is minimum wage, the tips on a good day are l5 dollars, and everyone is expected to comply with this rigid culture and be a ""top performer"" which leads to ego wars, needless competition, and everyone's own interpretation about the rules and conduct.","Don't expect criminals to have high standards, and do background checks before you let an entire posse promote all their little friends to places of authority. The progressive image of chipotle does not support these practices as high standards. and if people knew they were biting into a burrito that had 600 mg of sodium and that made employees thirsty for right wing agendas for Ayn Rand kool-aid, they would leave in a heartbeat or lack thereof."

"""Not as up to standard as it claims to be""",1.0," Aug 20, 2015",Past,Crew Member,,No,Neutral,Neutral,Full-time,More than 3 years,"Starts above minimum wage, ""ethical"" farming practices, flexible scheduling, free food during your shifts","Working as a crew member, I was taught to make salsas. Managers would constantly drive into my head that I needed to have high standards such as if the rice's cilantro looked brown, toss it out, or if the guacamole looked brown, scrape it off or toss it out. Prep and even managers confused me every day and would constantly tell me to half recipes and even at one point, quarter recipes, forcing me to skimp on cilantro and jalapeños, due to their inabilities to manage their time, so instead of cutting more jalapeños or cilantro, they would have me cut the recipes down severely in key ingredients to prevent themselves from doing more work. I don't believe that cutting down on key ingredients is ""high standards"" and felt like the managers were constantly picking and choosing which parts of the restaurant had high standards and which ones didn't matter, which was hypocritical. One specific manager even got angry at me for halving the recipe, saying that I was using too much and to cut down what I was using in half again. I felt like she was being hostile and I felt that I could not do my job the way I was taught to because she was angry and frustrated with me for doing what I was supposed to. One Yelp review of our Chipotle restaurant even noted that our salsas were not spicy anymore, indicating that YES, someone actually noticed that we were skimping out on jalapeños. Managers are never wearing hats in the back when they prep food. I have pulled out numerous hairs out of foods due to the fact that none of them wear hats when in the back. Once again, a customer pulled me to the side mentioning this, so someone did notice people walking around in the back without any sort of hair restraint beside a loose pony tail/bun. Chipotle also prides themselves, saying that crew members decide who gets hired, fired, promoted. This is such a far fetched concept, as there would be times I would come into work and there would be someone new there, already hired, whom I had never met before. Or someone who would be on the schedule, not show up, and it turns out they had been fired, and I had never been aware of it. There have been numerous incidents where crew members were promoted, yet have had customer complaints on Yelp or even in person due to their bad attitudes. I personally have experienced negative attitudes toward me due to the person being in a bad mood and looking just for others to take out their frustrations out on, all while in front of customers. I felt that I was in a cult-like environment while I was working here, as there were definitions we had to memorize and were asked numerous times a day what the Chipotle definition of certain things were and if you were not up to speed on definitions, you would be written up. I find that this was an extremely useless way of promoting good work ethic, team work, and overall good top performing employees, due to the fact that workers who had attitude problems or over all had a feeling of superiority over others, knew the definitions and were never written up for their attitudes, yet workers who were not up to speed with the definitions yet provided excellent customer service and finished all their work on time would quickly be written up for not knowing a definition word for word. While I worked at Chipotle, I also experienced complete unprofessionalism from the managers. There was always loud music, including profanity, playing in the back and no one cared how loud it was even though customers could hear it even in the front of the restaurant. Managers and favored crew members, hiding behind corners and stacks of boxes in order to scare other employees, causing their screams to be heard everywhere in the restaurant during store hours. In just the 3 months that I had been there, 2 managers and 1 crew member were fired, as well as more than 6 others quit and after asking why they left, I more than once heard that their new places of employment provided a better working environment and they were much happier not being at Chipotle anymore. Many of my coworkers, including myself, have had to get 2nd jobs due to Chipotle not giving out enough hours which is frustrating because in the 3 months I worked there, I had been called to come in over 10 times due to someone not showing up, they were under staffed, etc. Then when I declined because I had to either work at my 2nd job or I had plans, they would be clearly upset by not even bothering to text back with an ""Okay, thanks anyway"" or anything. They would just ignore me. I felt like this work environment was hostile, unfriendly, and very unpleasant. I quickly put my 2 weeks in and will gladly be working for another company now.","Stop cutting the recipes down, the customers actually notice. Stop hiring so many people and scheduling so few hours. If you actually gave those hours to people who are clearly willing to work and have full availabilities, instead of giving those hours to people who are inconsistent and have a lot of unavailable days, then maybe you wouldn't get so many call outs and ""sick"" employees who would have to have their shifts covered anyway. Also, stop with the attitudes. We are in customer service and while managers may not be serving me, I still expect to be treated as a human being, with dignity and respect. I have never felt so insecure and attacked in a work environment in the 5 years I have worked in retail, customer service, and the food industry."

You'll find out why under the ""Cons"" section. As far as Pros, I really enjoyed the social aspect of the company and the friendliness of the corporate staff. For the most part, the culture is laid back and I had a great time with my colleagues. Also, I fully believe in sustainable and humane farming and treatment of farm animals which aligns with the company culture. Unfortunately, that is the only Pro.","I was so dissatisfied with this company for so many reasons that I felt it necessary to warn people about the corporate setting as my first ever review on glassdoor. First of all, they failed to disclose many things to me before I started working there as a New Restaurant Development Coordinator. For example, they expect you to work roughly 50 hours a week and you're only suppose to spend 50% of your time doing what is described on the job description. The other 50%, they expect you to ""seek out opportunities to better the company"" whether that be programming software or scrubbing the financial performance of a vendor. Keep in mind, these examples have nothing to do with the job description so not only are you being lied to before you even start your job, you may not even be prepared to take on some of these ""extra projects."" The place is ruled by a lady named Shawna who has far too much power and rules the corporate office through fear. Yes, you heard correctly, fear. During my time there, the entirety of the old team which included 8 team members were either fired or forced from the company. I guess that should've been a warning sign, hind sight is 20/20 I suppose. Since I've been gone, they've practically turned the team over again! This is within the span of only 2 years! Corporate turnover is extremely high, because employees are forced to meet unrealistic expectations which are never good enough. HERE IS THE KICKER. They expect you to work this hard for them, but they also openly disclosed that people usually don't get raises... seems like a conflict of interest, also comical. The only way you're going to see a significant pay bump is if you get promoted (which is rare). When you DO get promoted, you'll look back at your life like Ann Hathaway did in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and realize you just lost your entire personal life because only workaholics succeed there. I would rate Chipotle corporate at the lowest level possible and this is NOT to be confused with the staff that actually works within the restaurants. The restaurant staff gets treated far better than corporate, funny how the inconsistency in culture works out. Fair warning, you're better off heading for the hills than working for Shawna and corporate. They don't care about you, you're just a number that's, and I quote, ""VERY replaceable."" Young college grads, beware of the false promises... I was you.","This idea of ""Top Performer"" really needs to be re-evaluated. You're leading by fear. Shawna is not a nice person and I would never ever work for her ever again. I don't discount that she's smart and good at her job, but she doesn't inspire me to work hard for Chipotle, but rather the opposite. I'm not alone, many corporate staff have expressed the same feelings. The sad thing, I don't think the executive team even knows the truth. Hopefully this will be a wake up call. I realize I may be just one sample size, but take this into consideration... everyone is too afraid to tell you the truth. How sad is that."

This is due to the upper management not having great communication with their stores. People were getting fired over the relationship between my GM and her Service Manager because of their knowledge of it or if the SM had wandering eyes. None of the upper management noticed this, but all of the crew did, resulting in a period of mass quitting. A manager at another store also has multiple sexual harassment violations against him, but is still in a high position despite continuing his actions with my crew members.<br><br>Poor hiring process. Prior to my leaving, many people were being hired to fill the void of those that had left/were fired, and many of these people did not meet the 13 characteristics. This resulted in a factor of luck, as only one prospect per every 4 hiring processes actually stayed longer than a month due to them actually being good.<br><br>Awfully disproportional pay.

My 2nd GM fainted on the job because of how hard he was working, and the guy was 24.<br><br>In regards to scheduling, if you're close with your church, don't expect a job here.

If you are one of these people, your chances of working there drop dramatically, considering Sunday morning is one of our busiest shifts.","Be more aware of what is happening in your stores, and do not give free passes to people who mess up big time. Do not encourage manager/crew friendship that extends outside the store, as that leads to high school-esque levels of drama. Across the board pay rates make your workers happy.

They hire based off of 13 ideal characteristics so they can build an ideal team. They don't care about how you look as much as they care about you being a good person and a good worker....this is one of the only places I've heard of that allows team members AND management to openly display tattoos, piercings, plugs, etc....Team members are included in the hiring process and ultimately determine whether to hire someone or not. This creates a good team and fun work environment with little to no slacking/picking up the slack for other people. Also, the company has and abides by very high standards, so everything is cleaned and taken care of the way they are supposed to. The company offers dental and vision to part-time and full-time employees, as well as different healthcare plan options. You get free food when you work and 50% off when you're not working. Your 30 min lunch breaks are paid. They hire from within if you want to move up to management positions, and they train extensively for those wanting to be in management. Since the store was so short staffed, I got OT right away, and my managers are great with working around everyone's schedule.","This is by far the hardest job I've ever had. One reason is due to the fact that my store is very understaffed. However, we have interviewed tons of people, but because of their high standards, they would rather be short staffed with the right people than hire extra help that might not work out later. This can leave you discouraged by not being able to achieve company standards and expectations even though you are working your tail off for the company. Also because of their high standards, closing the restaurant takes hours, and even though we close at 10, I can bet on being there until at least 12:30am every night. They nit-pick at things like offering line items in a particular order or not rolling your burrito to a certain shape...which can be discouraging. Because of the ""top performer culture"", every thing you do wrong is noticed by your coworkers, and they make it a point to tell you what you're doing wrong every time...which can also be discouraging. In their defense though, they are just trying to make you better. Dishes are washed by hand, which takes forever, and you have to do jobs like clean out the drain socks full of muck and food and get on your knees to polish the sink pipes. Working the line means doing fast, repetitive motions for 1-3 hours at a time, leaving you sore long after your shift is over. Although breaks are paid, you only get one 30 min break when working 10+ hours (no smoke breaks), and you have to attend an off-the-clock mini meeting every night to reinforce company culture. Finally, most of the people that come through the line are rude, entitled, gluttonous, and cheap. They want a 2lb burrito and then complain about paying for guacamole. Overall, my coworkers and benefits are great, but the job itself is not so much...",To my managers: you are great. Please continue to support your team and give us the reinforcement we need so that we may exceed company standards and expectations.

They are constantly trying to get better and to make their staff and restaurants get better also. The problem is that, because all the rules they got, it can get very tought.

The enviroement is good, friendly teammate who are also trying to help you, because its part of Chipotle's vision.

You learn them all and work with them but because of time, some managers want things faster but not better. In the Chipotle I work, I have to tell them ""How do you prefer it? Faster or as Chipotle Standards say?"" so I can continue doing it as I'm supposed to do it. I have worked in 2 Chipotles (I had to transfer cause I was moving from Maryland to Virginia). The first Chipotle was Military-like, everything was done as Chipotle said, you couldn't modify anything, they had the best management I've seen, but there were less opportunities to grow and it was tougher. The second one, has more freedom, A LOT of freedom, so crew members are used to do things as they want and not as they are suppose to. They change recipes, they don't follow standards and break even easy-to-follow rules. Managers work like that so they don't care how things are, but how fast you are. This can be some troublesome, you can even get in trouble with a customer. And if you follow their ""rules"" and not Chipotle's ones, they can even try to control you and take advantage of you. The difference between the Chipotle are the sales. While in the first one we were full of customers at almost every hour, in this one no. So in the first store, they could afford enough personal to do every task and to have at 3 or 4 managers working at the same time. In the second one, there are less people, so you have to do more tasks.<br><br>As conclusion:<br>Its not impossible to work with, but you have to be careful on the management of the store. If you follow Chipotle rules and not them, it will be easier for you and if you get on troubles because doing the right thing, you can talk with the person in charge of your boss, not sure how they call him/her. If you want a job were you can get easily promoted by being good, this is the one. You have to be careful to manage your balance between Physical Stress and Psychological Stress.","-Try to follow the rules a little more.<br>-Try to have more control on what Crew Members think, cause if the Manager of the store doesn't care, the store wont work well.

I also learned some very useful kitchen skills such as food safety, proper knife handling and care, cutting various types of food. A vast knowledge of the menu and food, allergens and the sustainable practices will be very helpful when on the line and dealing with customers.","My first and foremost complaint is the lack of recognition of real skill and desire to advance- upon hire I was promised these opportunities (""you could make kitchen manager in six months, if you try hard enough-"" and boy did I try, in vain!...) Priority to train and promote someone hired at the same time as me was placed above my own advancement, possibly because they had more kitchen experience than I did (but in my interview, I was told that prerequisite skill, education and job history would not be a determining factor in my success... this was obviously not the case.) Management can be conflicting and, at times, very hypocritical; it is hard to finish a task when two people are telling you to do two very different things. There was definitely some favoritism in the management and crew as well and this would cause resentment among and crew and create a negative atmosphere. Even the district manager had, at most, 2 meetings with me during my lengthy 5+ months of employment, and those were in my first month or two, only. There is never a dull moment at Chipotle, unless you're in throughput and there is no one in line- in which case you are literally just standing around, waiting to serve food. Often times those who are great at customer service end up stuck in the front of the house, sweating as they work feverishly on the line scooping rice and beans, and burning their hands on tortillas, while those with seniority are given the freedom to roam the kitchen looking for odd tasks, or take their time cutting bell peppers. The amount of work you do, even considering the generous increase in starting wage compared to minimum wage, is simply not worth it. I had no free time, I was called in on almost all of my days off and usually felt too guilty not to come in- I ended up constantly picking up the slack of low performers, staying to help when I didn't need to, and busting my behind for a company that, when given the opportunity to promote me, gave the opportunity to someone else, equally or less deserving, and never even considered me.","Focus more on the people, and on the culture. Do not underestimate the stresses of the front line- dealing with customers face to face and constantly calling for food to a grill cook who, more likely than not, can either not hear you or doesn't respond, can get as stressful as something like running grill... Reward your top performers for their effort and acknowledge their support, or they will turn on you and get tired of it, as I did. Reprimand low performers and make their insubordination a real priority, rather than pushing others to pick up their slack and treating the situation lightly, or they will continue to tread all over the crew! And finally, I reiterate, THE FRONT LINE IS KEY. I cannot even count the number of customer complaints that *I* had gotten when on the line by myself, doing everything I could to maintain my sense of urgency and quality, when others refused to hop on the line to help, even though these things were not *my* fault! Incentives like 'employee of the month,' 'best customer service,' 'top performer' awards and more might be a good starting place to actually motivate your crew members to be successful and employ some of their hidden 13 characteristics... and don't forget that as a manager it's YOUR job to EMPOWER your crew!"

Management will expect you to come in during times you aren't scheduled to work. I didn't feel empowered to put my foot down, at first...I thought I was screwing up and putting down the wrong dates and times in my calendar. But after the 3rd time I was told to cancel obligations to come in and work, I began taking home a hard copy of the schedule each week. To my shock (and relief that I wasn't imagining things after all), I realized that management would change or add shifts behind my back and not tell me until the night before or (more commonly) the day of.

Consistently changing the schedule and expecting me to drop obligations at a moment's notice, though, is highly discouraging and unprofessional.

Let me, first, guide you through a story about how your general managers behave within your company.<br>My hiring manager was very nice, as well as professional. I got the job after two interviews, my first with two lower-level managers, and my second with one of your kitchen managers. My first question when I interviewed at Chipotle was: wait... how many managers does this place even have? Why does it take so many managers to run this store when there are only about twenty employees?<br>The answer, my friends, is because they are all completely immature, rude, and selfish.<br>It took Chipotle four weeks to put me on the schedule once they told me I got the job. I had to call in every week to see if I was written in yet, only to be told to call back the next week. Four times.<br>Once I got to my orientation, it wasn't bad at all. I went through about an hour of one-on-one with my hiring manager reading through the employee hiring handbook, talking an awful lot about hard work, how different they were as a restaurant, the restaurant's goals of becoming restauranteur (an okay idea, at best), and empowerment. They were BIG on empowerment. I think I heard that word more in four hours of orientation than I did in my entire life beforehand. They insisted the company empowers people, and that you will love your work, and the people you work with.<br>You won't.<br>Halfway through my orientation, I noticed a lot of people were whispering around, even coming into the clearly occupied office where I was watching my videos to gossip, only to turned around once they realized I was in the room. It was strange, to say in the least, but I figured it wasn't my business, whatever it was, and continued watching my orientation videos.<br>About an hour later, my hiring manager comes in to tell me exactly what is going on. Allegedly, my general manager (who I hadn't even met yet) slept with a crew member of another Chipotle during a party (apparently Chipotle stores get together and having raging, drug and alcohol fueled parties...). My general manager's boyfriend is a manager of another nearby Chipotle. Supposedly, they broke up because THEIR MUTUAL BOSS told her boyfriend about her activities during the party. My hiring manager confided in me and I told her I wouldn't tell anyone. This kind of high school drama didn't even wait for my first day. This happened within four hours of my orientation. When I was finished with my videos and ready to leave, I couldn't, because my hiring and general managers were out back smoking and talking on phones and crying and fussing up a complete storm. I had to wait an extra hour (getting paid to do nothing) just to leave my orientation. Easy free money, sure, but it didn't scream professionalism by any means.<br>As for my first and only week working for them, I was told I would be trained my first five days, and then I would be on my own, and should know everything. I was trained for one day by a very overly enthusiastic older woman. I was trained to make chips. I did that for the entire seven hours of my shift, with a small one to two hour window when I worked line and made food for our customers. My first day was tiring, but it wasn't awful.<br>However, as the week progressed, it got worse. I was not trained formally by anyone. ANYONE. Not a single person took time out of their day to help train me on things they didn't think I was up to standard on. I worked all morning shifts, getting to the store at eight AM. Between 8 in the morning and 11, there are three hours during which any single person at Chipotle could have trained me and still gotten their work done for lunch rush. No one did.<br>Anytime something was wrong, or if I wasn't doing something correctly, my coworkers felt the need to ""empower"" me (translated: yell at me) during the worst possible times, such as in the middle of lunch rush when I was trying to fill orders, or when I was trying to learn something on my own. Not a single manager trained me. Out of six. One cut the limes I needed for chips one day. That was one of the only nice gestures I experienced.<br>Anytime I responded to criticism in anyway, I was told to ""not be so defensive"". This included just saying, ""ah, I know. Sorry about that, it was stupid of me,"" when I had realized my own mistake just seconds before someone else mentioned it.<br>The drama with my general manager continued during the entire week. I was approached often by coworkers, who told me to stop talking and work faster because I was trying to have light conversation and get to know the people I was working with. However, it was totally acceptable for my general manager, who gets salary by the way, to answer personal phone calls on the company phone and chain smoke in the back all day, as long as she pleased. It was also okay for her to talk and whine about her relationship to everyone and anyone that would listen in the kitchen prep area in the back of the restaurant. Everyone was free to take time to listen to her, but no one took three seconds out of their day to make me feel welcome except for two extremely sweet guys. Naturally, once those guys found out that I am currently engaged, they also stopped eating on break with me, as well as talking to me during shift at all. It was like working for a bunch of high schoolers. Not one single employee was capable and mature.<br>So, there you have it. The one week I worked at Chipotle. I wish it would have gone better. I did not anticipate it to be as bad as it was at all. I was genuinely shocked, and it was the first job I've ever had that I wanted to quit. I didn't even put in a two weeks. I can honestly say this place was the worst job I've ever had (and I've worked at Salvation Army!)."

My GM lies every single time our atl visits and coaches the crew on what to say. They hire their friends and family like a mafia.

"""REVIEW OF CHIPOTLE""",3.0," Mar 24, 2014",Past,Anonymous Employee,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Part-time,,"- Chipotle professes to do it's best to use only meat and dairy products in their from farms that raise their animals ethically and in their natural environment, without antibiotics, hormones, etc. They also profess to do their best to use all organic, non-GMO grown vegetables in their burritos. This is an excellent reason to check them out as a possible employer, and the reason I give the restaurant 3 stars out of 5 stars, instead of just 2 stars.<br>- Chipotle recruits it's management largely from within.","- The training is fun, but in the end, there is too much hype and not enough practical training.<br>- Managers need more training in how to run a restaurant and, more specifically, in how to supervise.<br>- Crew members do not receive enough training and the training amongst all employees is not evenly distributed.<br>- While good customer service and friendliness is encouraged extensively during training, it is almost nearly discouraged in favor of speed of the line once training is over and actual work begins<br>- Crew members can not receive a decent number of work hours. They are only allowed a maximum of 25-30 hours/week, though near full-time hours are implied in the training schedule. Work hours decrease rapidly within the first two weeks of employment, getting as low as 15-17 hours/week.<br>- There is a ""dog-eat-dog"" mentality on the ""line"" and in general, and not enough attention is paid to who is actually doing what. Since the managers use other crew to assist them in assessing fellow crew members, this leads to evaluations that are far from even-handed and fair. This, in and of itself, is not the problem, except that too many of those crew members helping in this area are afraid of losing their own jobs or losing the already too few hours they have. This makes them less likely to give the best evaluation of their co-worker.<br>- Quality suffers as a result of trying costs to pay employees, because they are encouraged to do too much with too few employees.<br>- There is very little diversity, with a large percentage of employees being Hispanic/Latino.<br>- Chipotle seems to favor younger employees to older employees.

My coworkers didn't even help me when I needed help, therefore, the teamwork was definitely crappy. What's the point of being a team, if the coworkers won't even help you? I had an allergic reaction once and I couldn't breathe and no one cared; they told me to stop whining I'm not the only one who's allergic to things so get back to work.Then things started to go downhill after a week, they kept sending me home all the time and they never send anyone else. My hours and work days were decreasing like crazy to the point where I only work one day a week and for only 2 hours. I'm not even making enough money to pay for gas...and that's not all, even though I only get to work this much, sometimes they even call me not to come in...I don't want to jump to conclusion but my theory is that my coworkers were quite racist because I was the only asian there and they didn't treat newcomers badly, just only me. Overall, I really dislike working here, everything was unfair, and people treated me like crap...sad thing is, this was my first job too...and it's really stressful having people always yelling at you, telling you faster faster and do this or do that at the same time, I only have two hands, I can't do all of that. It's like they are trying to work me really hard on purpose...This job is definitely really stressful and with the bad treatment, it's not worth staying there, but don't take my opinion, where you work may be different. You might have people who treat you like a human being...But an advice, if you are looking for your first job, don't start off here, it's a load of stress to take on, mostly if you're a student."

Ultimately I was let-go due to ""inconsistent performance"" which could also be said about the department in general; inconsistent hours, inconsistent expectations, inconsistent feedback, inconsistent staffing, inconsistent attendance of our immediate manager who was constantly out due to health concerns, etc. If you want your employees to be consistent, lead by example and be consistent as well.<br><br>Be empowering: My immediate manager was not empowering at all and would constantly micro-manage and spy on employees; to her, everyone (customers, coworkers, business partners, etc.) was guilty until proven innocent.

Ironically, when she was out for several weeks for health problems, the department managed itself just fine. Learn to let go and to trust the people around you.<br><br>Understand Work-Life Balance: Our department was worked so hard that word got to the CEO and he came down himself to individually interview everyone where he also determined that everyone was being worked far beyond what's necessary. My immediate manager works at least 65-70 hours/week and the stress is literally destroying her health. It was not uncommon to see her (or others) sending out emails at midnight on the weekend. Turnover in our department is quite high and good people have left due to (in their words) the favoritism, lack of communication, and dis-encouragement of work-life balance. Those who decided to come in at 7:00 am and work until 6:00 pm each day were not only rewarded, but held as a standard of work performance. Encourage your people to work only 8 hours/day and to go home afterward and you'll end up with employees who are more empowered and, ultimately, more efficient.<br><br>Have a clear-cut path for growth: In my department, there was no clear path to go up... at all. We were simply told, ""Well, there might be a manager position sometime in the distant future."" The more I contributed and developed, the more praise I would get from my Executive Director and the more my immediate manager would feel threatened and tell me to stop which is not only very, very confusing and stressful, but is also not empowering or a good example to set for growth.

Definitely the cleanest restaurant I have ever worked at ( I have also filled in at 3 additional locations aside from the Marlborough one, so I can vouch for them as well). The culture is very laid-back and liberal, which is a great fit for like-minded people, but may be awkward if you are not. As long as the company is growing, there are excellent opportunities for advancement from workers who are consistent, who ""fit in"" with the culture, and who express desire to make a career out of it.","The sales have been increasing rapidly for quite some time, so doing much of the preparation by hand using ""traditional culinary methods"" becomes tiresome and difficult if left to the same position every day. Front of house is much easier than back of house as far as workload goes, but it involves customer service, which some may not prefer. Also, the culture tends to favor ""cool"" people, who tend to get promoted if they are extroverted and likeable, regardless of qualifications. Although most of the managers are very easygoing and approachable, some may not perform their jobs very well, and may result in you having stressful shifts when they are in charge. There seems to be a high turnover rate amoingst less well-established restaurants with managers who end up going to college (after they graduate), and from other managers at said locations who are just incompetent that either quit or get fired. Also, there is a pay cut when promoted from Service Manager to Apprentice (it goes from hourly to salary, but the hours stay the same and the pay averages out to less - but even so, after a relatively short period as Apprentice, you are very likely to get promoted to Restaurant Manager, which is better in terms of pay, work, and benefits. After GM, the opportunities are excellent if promoted - including bonuses and opportunities with corporate (if you are interested in that).","Upper management should consider sales volume and team size more when evaluating the individual restaurants, and seek management based on business management capabilities rather than just their personality types.

Also, there were employees who needed more hours to pay their bills and were not giving more hours or an explanation while new hires were brought in.

When I put what I was trained was the company standard amount of rice in the burrito the customers would yell at me that I was being stingy with the rice and that the other employees always put in more. When I would add more the cooks would yell at me that I was causing them to make more rice than they were use to and ""wasting"" rice. When I would add meat to a burrito there was a definite amount added and then any more required the customer to pay a bit extra...except when a customer complained that I did not give them ""enough"" by some unseen standard and then they were given more with no charge.

Also, You'll never go hungry working at Chipotle. Your meals after you work a shift are free and your meals any other time are 50 percent off. They're also pretty flexible with the scheduling.","Some of the Managers are really awful people to work with. And sometimes they have too many managers on duty at the same time which makes things very confusing because each manager has ""their way"" of doing things and you end up having 3 different managers giving 3 different sets of instructions for the same thing. The training needs major help. Chipotle's idea of training is making you watch a 5 minuted video of a ""re-enactment of how service is suppose to run. However, their re-enactment does not include anything that really happens during the course of the day, so it's very unrealistic. Then they put you in a real situation and expect you to handle it.

"""Substandard, Distasteful and downright Disappointing!""",1.0," Feb 23, 2014",Past,Kitchen Manager In Training,,No,Neutral,Neutral,Part-time,Less than a year,"For someone with any small amount of cafe or restaurant experience, the work environment (only when you're starting out) is an easy one to adapt to. The Chipotle concept is straightforward and easy to pick up. Chipotle sets itself apart from other fast-food companies by using fresh, often organic, ingredients which is an easy model to stand behind. The company allows 1 free meal to its employees per shift worked. Chipotle seems to really back personal growth for its employees. Management is constantly looking to help its star employees continue to learn and move up in position. Pay is subpar for the amount of work and skills necessary to be successful in your job (especially kitchen and prep), but it is a bit above average compared to other minimum wage, restaurant jobs.","Chipotle is a very challenging company to work for, like many restaurant environments, but being the growing and fruitful business that it is, its employees deserve better. Management is hardly just that. They don't respond appropriately or quickly to employee-related incidents or injuries (if the employee gets a response at all), scheduling is inconsistent and employees are often kept much, much longer than their scheduled shifts without any notice, compliance with state labor and wage laws is extremely lacking and store management is not properly trained around these laws, a lot of wires seem to get crossed when it comes to communication between corporate, management and staff. The entire company doesn't seem to have the right people in the the right job in the right place. There is a strong emphasis on marketing but the training programs or the way management chooses to use them leaves quite a bit of room for improvement. If your goal is to move up within the company, prepare sacrifice your personal life. This is the kind of job that attracts people who just don't care about what they do, so be prepared to experience frustration with co-workers and management who lack any interest in getting things done. A lot (meaning way way way too much) food that is prepared becomes garbage throughout the day.","It seems that corporate management has a great idea of what they would like to be going on in their restaurants, but those ideas get lost in translation on their way down to the crew members. Management should be properly trained so their crews can be properly trained. Employee incidents and injuries should be taken very seriously and handled with the utmost care and attention. Management should be qualified for the position they are in. They must have a strong knowledge of their state's labor and wage laws and they must enforce compliance. It is a difficult job, given the wages the employees are allowed. So do what is within your means to make it easier for the people that are on the ""front line"" making your company money every single day. You need to make your hard-working employees feel appreciated to build team morale and loyalty. It's not asking too much. Buckle-down on labor compliance issues, proper training and creating an environment where work/life balance is of importance. Believe it or not, getting paid a dollar or more over minimum wage is not nearly enough to sell your soul and your life to the company you work for. You don't need employees that are devoted enough to wait hand and foot on Chipotle, you need employees that respect their job and enjoy, for lack of a better term, coming in to work every day because their company respects them back."

Despite my lack of training for weeks, I was frequently chastised by the management for not knowing various procedures of operating the restaurant that my coworkers refused to teach me when I asked them for help.

People who stay are mostly driven with the idea of constantly getting evaluated to elevate their position within the store, and so it functions similarly to a pyramid scheme, you better the people below you with the intention of moving up yourself, and you move up because if you make your entire existence about chipotle, your paycheck will increase a couple of dollars every few months. Your life totally becomes Chipotle, and because people work so much, like 10 or 12 hours shifts they end up calling in a lot because they are probably exhausted, and so expect to get a lot of calls all the time on your day off being asked to come in and cover someone else, or getting called to come in earlier. The manager and assistant managers relationships were failing because of how much time they had to spend giving their soul to chipotle. They emphasize the emotionally aspect of the job, and really prey on your emotionally so that your work and life are no longer separated, and although the employees mean well because they are all really brainwashed by the promise of working super hard to get restaurateur which usually means they're super excited at the potential of a 100,000 dollar salary. I personally had one of the worst work experiences of my life here, never had a break in 8 hours shifts, and if you ask for a break you're made to feel you are letting the team down because no one takes breaks, they're all focused on ""bettering one another"" and constantly reciting chipotle mantras that made the whole experience almost religious. I think Chipotle came up with a brilliant system to squeeze the most out of hardworking talented people while dangling carrots in front of their noses, and to make them feel they are bettering the world. My team was always understaffed, but because the manager refused to higher anyone who wasn't ""chipotle material"" didn't make the cut so it continued for weeks, until many people just started to leave. Every hour you got to wash your hands with soap that strips your skin, when someone yells party time because of the e coli scare even though it's proven a more sterile environment welcomes bad bacteria, because there is no good bacteria present to counter against it. You think you're eating healthy, and people are paying a pretty penny to eat meat that is flashed cooked in a plastic bag of boiling water. Corporate was constantly implementing new rules, and they make you keep a journal for ""growth"" but all the extra details hinder you from doing your basic job which is to serve people quickly and with a friendly demeanor, making the job incredibly stressful and feel like slave labour. You might get Stockholm syndrome, you care to much to leave, even though it would be what was honestly best for you, and you'll come up with a million reasons why you shouldn't, but if you're questioning you probably just should.
