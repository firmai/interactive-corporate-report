24,Karie H.,"Alpharetta, GA",87,319,321.0,1.0,2013-03-11,"I think a big part of this bad review was the location we happened to be in.  We walked in and the restaurant was half empty. We were told it would take a few min.. about10 min later we were seated and about 10 min later i snagged the hostess to let her know we  hadn't been noticed by the server yet.  She took the drink orders and then the server showed up. We placed the app and they came out fine.  Meanwhile 3 of the 4 of us were in need of refills. and those were hard to come by.   3 of our meals came out and about 8 min later the 4th persons came out.  I had ordered soup to come out first,  and she even came out to say that  it would be out shortly, but never came... and was on the bill as i came to find out (after we paid)  All in all we felt like we were a burden to the restaurant from the time we walked in to the time we left.. and I'm sorry... that's not customer service... You are a server to ...SERVE people. if you cant have a good attitude and even pretend to want to be there then get a new job... BOO Applebees in La Grange...

Same cannot be said for the help 40 minutes wait for a drink.  We were a 9 top but clueless would be an understatement for the staff.

29,Will B.,"Grayson, GA",27,5,,1.0,2014-01-03,"I usually love Applebee's but this one absolutely sucks! I usually eat at one when I'm traveling for work (frequently) as well as in my leisure time.  I typically receive a consistently fun experience with a great value for the buck. But tonight at this LaGrange GA location I had the worst experience I've ever had at an Applebee's and one of the worst dining experiences ever. When we sat down 10 minutes passed and no one said anything to us. I finally had to get up and ask the bartender who was assigned to our table. After they finally figured out they were out of the wine we wanted (the manager did come out and offer complimentary deserts for the inconvenience) we ordered. The food was slow, Dad's food was subpar but he suffered through it. My food was strait nasty. I informed my waitress and let her take the plate I barley touched away. She said she informed her manager, but the guy never comes to address the issue.  Instead of raising hell, I just told her to keep the comp desert (Dad did take his), paid the full price and resolved to NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. We travel to LaGrange frequently spending at least 6 nights per month in a nearby hotel.  From now on we will be going to the Longhorn's next door. Good by and good riddance !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lagrange-2?start=20,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000005
27,Rick C.,"Roanoke, AL",0,1,,1.0,2014-03-02,We ate at this Applebies and waited for a table even though there were empty tables. We get seated and place our order. Then they bring our food out but the only order they  got right was my wife's. they take her order back along with ours. The they bring our food out again after ten minutes but my order was still wrong. They took the wrong border back. I waited another 10-15 minutes before they brought my correct order out. Also on the floor next to our table was a dirty steak knife.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lagrange-2?start=20,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000005

So much for a quick lunch.  The story goes they had a problem in their kitchen but never bothered informing any of us. 45 minutes later we were ready to walk out and then they said there was an issue. Waited 5 more minutes for greasy somewhat cool food and incomplete orders.  Asked to see the manager, as did the table besides us, and nobody would come out. Gave us a coupon for a free order of cheese sticks instead (which definitely did not make up for the wait or food)   Would definitely NOT recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lagrange-2,,,,,

I ordered my salad and she gave me grilled chicken instead of fried chicken. I didn't mind that my salad finally came out after my friends finished eating their dinner, I didn't mind that I didn't get a refill and my cup was bone dry. But I do want good customer service. Put a smile on your face, as a paying customer I want to feel welcomed. Not like I'm bothering you. In the end my salad was delicious.

9,Taylor W.,"Forest City, NC",2,8,10.0,4.0,2016-01-02,"Four stars because of the unclean bathrooms and a small leak on the toilet. Our 2 waitresses were very kind and went out of her way to please my daddy, who wanted chicken parmesan which was unfortunately not on the menu. He ordered 2 children's chicken breasts with the cheese, the linguine noodles, sautéed jalapeños and lots of marinara sauce. Very complicated but they managed to do it. My mother ordered some sort of shrimp stir-fry with the green goddess wedge salad (I believe that's the name). Her food looked excellent. I ordered the steak and parmesan shrimp, without any cheese or scampi sauce. My steak was cooked as ordered and very good, no complaints here. My dad keeps telling our server how excellent his food was, how good and how thankful he was that they could put that together for him. We stop at this Apple Bees almost every year after our vacation. Always good people and a great time. We sat at the bar tonight so the service was excellent.

A friend and I went here for lunch on a Monday and we were the first customers there. Not that I come to a restaurant for music but the sound system was loud and static-y and not the best sound when you are trying to relax and enjoy a meal. I got one of the pasta lunch specials with a salad and it was delicious and just the right portion for lunch. I wanted to end it with a brownie bite and ice cream. When the server brought it to the table it smelled like it was burnt. I broke the brownie in half and it was like a piece of charcoal inside. I just politely told the server about it  and asked her to take it off my bill, but I was disappointed. Overall not the best experience and it will be a while before I go here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-lagrange-2,,,,,

You think with all the negative reviews, why go?inthe back of your mind you think it's a chain restaurant with some reasonable oversight.. well, you'd be wrong.  The service is moderately tolerable. Order accuracy is non-existent, and the beer lines need a cleaning (like last month) order a seasonal Sam Adams and it smelled terrible with a finish much like the smell. Stupid me.. I occasionally come to town on business and take those I'm meeting with to lunch. We chose this place two weeks ago and I was very unimpressed. Just came into town and thought I'd grab something to go and it's close to the hotel. Shame on me and who ever the DM is in the region. With this low of a score, someone should camp out here until it's fixed or shut it down if anyone actually.
