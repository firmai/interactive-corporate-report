18,Craig S.,"Roseville, MN",0,10,,3.0,2013-12-31,Been to a lot of chain style eateries. This one was better than most.  Excellent service with surprisingly quick food prep. Busy New Year's Eve but still quiet enough to hold a conversation. Food quality was about normal for a chili's or a tgif's. Would go again when I get back in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
15,Keith W.,"Murray, KY",40,56,4.0,4.0,2014-02-02,"This is my go-to place (for eating or drinking) when I am in Paducah. I dinged it one start because it is a chain, but given that, I am a fan of Friday's. Their menu is diverse, and while I would not go here for steaks, their burgers, sandwiches and salads are fine. They almost always have some kind of special running on appetizers, or some sort of deal, and I think their appetizer selection is one of the very best. I almost always go for chicken or sandwiches, or just order a couple of appetizers to share at the table. I am usually sitting at the bar, and that is where I think this location shines. They have an excellent bar staff, and a friendly crowd of regulars. Whether you are watching a sports game on one of the many TVs, or playing the wireless, Buzztime trivia game, it is casual and fun bar. The bartenders remember your drink and name, and are engaging and genuine. Of course, another reason I return is their ""Give Me More Stripes"" program - essentially you earn ""frequent diner"" points with every meal, and can redeem them for free food or discounts. In any case, it gets rather addictive, especially if you know you are going to get a free entree, or take $8.00 off of your final bill total. I dinged it one star because it is a chain, and because it is located in the thick of the ""mall traffic.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
13,Sabine F.,"Cibolo, TX",89,428,1269.0,3.0,2014-02-20,This T.G.I Friday's was very busy and thus the service was slower than usual. the food was average.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
16,Josh S.,"Ironton, OH",60,12,,1.0,2014-11-15,"I can't believe this place stays open. The Caesar salad was awful. I'm not sure how what we had qualified as a Caesar salad but I saw no similarities. The steak was what I would expect from ihop but that is probably an insult to ihop. I ordered the steak fries with my dinner and literally received 4 fries with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Save your money and eat somewhere else, anywhere but here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
17,Elizabeth N.,"Lawrence, KS",22,307,,2.0,2014-12-28,"This was one of the worst Friday's locations I have been to. The fries were cold and the pot-stickers undercooked with hard edges. Weak mixed drinks and service without a smile. The dessert was small. Also, the walls were totally blank which was creepy. I love Friday's, but this one left me disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
8,Mandee F.,"Raynham, MA",142,51,2.0,3.0,2015-02-23,"We had a very sub-par experience at this location. While our server was very sweet and on top of things, there were clearly some issues in the kitchen.  My plate came out about 10 minutes before my husband's...we would've preferred to get everything together. My dish, a house salad, appeared to have bacon bits all over it, which I noticed immediately. I sent it back as I don't eat bacon nor was I expecting it on the salad. The kitchen insisted there wasn't any bacon on it and so the server brought it back. My hubby then tried it and also concurred that there was some kind of crumble on the salad that tasted like bacon so it went back again. Someone from the kitchen brought out a new one and made sure I looked for anything funny on it because no one believed my prior salad had contained bacon. (The new salad had no crumbles on it and lacked the previous bacon taste, so I have no idea what was on the first one.) Onto my husband's meal: he ordered two apps, one of which being the BBQ chicken flatbread. It came out without any chicken on it. I don't think I need to say much more as that really speaks for itself... (They made him a new one after we sent it back.)  Overall, we loved our server (3 star rating only for her, otherwise would've been a 1) but the kitchen needs work. The food was just not coming out right. We probably won't go back again during our stay in KY this week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
5,Alyona Z.,"Lexington, KY",376,258,1277.0,4.0,2015-05-30,"A very nice and quick bite type of place. I sat at the bar and the service was pretty fast. I ordered the corned beef sliders, ahi tuna crisps, along with sirloin beef skewers. Which were all very tasty and delicious. Our bartender Jamie will take very good care of you and your order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
14,John P.,"Dresden, TN",0,4,,2.0,2015-06-06,"Slow service, the table next to me complained to the manager about finding a roach in their food as we were leaving.  Food is adequate at best.  Should have known when only six tables full at noon on Saturday that this would be nothing special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
9,Regal P.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,3,,2.0,2015-07-19,Horrible service!!! Food was not good!! Ordered a to go entree and they had it sitting at the counter for approx 15 mins until I asked if my food was ready to go. Then they proceeded to give me the food like if it was not cold already. Will not come back. They need bartenders who know what they are doing. TGI used to be my go to spot but in Paducah it's horrible! Chefs there don't know how to make the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
11,Vinnie B.,"Louisville, KY",0,14,,1.0,2016-06-07,"Walked in from a two hour drive, walked right back out. A DJ or something was at 500decibles and I swear I think people were smoking at the bar. Stay far away!!  No surprise TGIF are closing every day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
12,Mk Z.,"Paducah, KY",0,36,,3.0,2016-06-23,"Once again Bruce York saved the day (night) at last nights dinner.  This time he was bar tending but also was our food server.  Seemed like they were having hell night staffing wise.  No hostesses, servers not taking care of business.  Sat in dining room, but couldn't get service.  Went to bar and Bruce took great care of us.  Food was good as usual.  Seems manager was stuck in kitchen, was definitely an off day for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
10,John M.,"Tallapoosa, GA",37,2,,1.0,2016-08-11,Went in for the Ten Dollar apps. They were out the wings and the flatbread. Food we did order was greasy.  Don't stop here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
6,Greg V.,"Paducah, KY",0,3,,4.0,2016-10-18,"This has been our ""go to"" for a good meal and conversation for some time when we have many choices. Yes... they have the same food choices as any other Fridays but if you can catch Bruce on his shift.... He makes it happen at the bar and apparently can ""energize and  inspire"" the kitchen staff.  Great staff and good food for Any Day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
3,Lyle O.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,2,,3.0,2016-10-18,"Hello, I frequent TGI Fridays on a national scale. Coast to coast (not to brag). I was craving a little JDR's (Jack Daniels Ribs) so decided to visit the local Fridays. The young gentleman was nice enough, however brought out the normal Ribs. This is a full rack, no kids meal here, big boy stuff. With my experience, I know that the JDR's come with that JD sauce cooked into the ribs making them borderline orgasmic. Anybody that's been into TGI Fridays more than once knows the normal ribs are something you wouldn't feed your dog. After bringing it to the young gentleman's attention, he mentioned the only difference was the sauce (wrong). Being polite, I said no worries, bring out the Jack Daniels Sauce (JDS). I was able to dig deep and battle through the combination of the sewage BBQ sauce that comes on the normal ribs, and the JDS and able to salvage the meal.  All in all I give it a 3 out of 5.  P.S.- not giving out wet wipes with a rib meal (full rack no less) is borderline psychotic. Writing this review was difficult.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
0,Kristi O.,"Plainfield, IL",391,410,1452.0,3.0,2016-12-05,"We ordered take out on 12/4/16 for dinner.  I went with their grilled chicken cobb salad with blue cheese dressing $10.00 and my husband had their Yucatan salad $10.70. The chicken was cold which was odd b/c he said when he went to pick it up,  the lady said they were just waiting on the chicken so you world have thought it would have been hot or at least warm- nope, nada. The bacon on my salad was fatty so my husband ate most of it which was a bummer for me as it should be crispy IMO, no exceptions. Overall,  it was an okay experience.  The girl that took our order was nice, the salads were good minus a few preference issues",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
1,Valerie D.,"Eddyville, KY",141,177,319.0,3.0,2017-01-11,I give it 3 stars because it's clean.  The food is not the greatest.  I ordered two salads to go.  The wedge salad with chicken and the other with steak.  I have to say the salads were just ok nothing  specal.   I can't say what the rest of their food is like only the salad.  I had to wait 20 mins in the bar for them as I got takeout.  I sure hope the waitress working the bar didn't touch my food because she was coughing the entire time I was there and didn't cover her mouth.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
4,David B.,"Enterprise, AL",53,9,1.0,2.0,2017-01-24,"Not impressed. Table was not wiped off, servers hands were dirty and he was grabbing our glasses by the brims, and the food came out well behind other tables' orders. Won't come back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
7,J J.,"Marion, KY",0,68,23.0,1.0,2017-03-09,We went here one night about 9pm.  Ordered a couple of entrees and a few drinks. It took an hour to get our food.  There were like 5 tables in the entire place?  Several employees were eating in the dining room.  Playing. Cutting up.  having a good time.  I guess the kitchen was busy fixing food for them and not the customers.  Starts at the top.  Crappy manager = crappy employees    and crappy training  adds to the mess.  We won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
2,Jeremiah M.,"Mayfield, KY",1,7,,1.0,2017-08-28,"Terrible hostess staff: no smiles, not friendly.  Servers are poorly trained in hospitality and service of customers.  There is no standard og etiquette here. The management staff is the poorest I've ever seen. They allowed a customer to grop our server at our table and told her to suck it up and continue serving customers.  The man did it twice to her while passing by to use the restroom. The managers on duty are always sitting in booths talking and eating while they allow 1 server to serve anywhere from 6 to 8 tables with no assistance.  I would never apply here for a job. I definitely will not go back here ever nor will I visit other locations of this chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-paducah,,,,,
