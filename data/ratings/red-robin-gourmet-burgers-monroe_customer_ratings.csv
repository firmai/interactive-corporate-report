The kitchen can't seem to have any consistency with themselves or the rest of the Red Robin locations. Whenever we bring up issues to the GM, he comps it as if that's going to fix the problem. When it happens week after week, obviously it's the kitchens issue. Comping the meal won't get the kitchen to do their job correctly. He also seems to glare and nit pick on the serving staff all while his kitchen is falling apart.

My boyfriend and I walked in to sit in the bar area as we have many times before and ordered freckled lemonade when were asked for identification. I handed our server my temporary ID along with my cancelled Texas ID. I was then told they would not accept my identification, as it was not plastic. I find that difficult to believe that you can fly on a plane with the temporary IDs but not sit in a bar at RR. If that is their bizarre policy then so be it I would have gladly obliged, but I was shocked when the server slammed my IDs on the table and demanded we leave the bar. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told with serious attitude that they had left for the night and that I needed to leave ... NOW.

I asked the not so interested in her job hostess if we could make a to go order, and she told us to go to the bar and FIND SOMEONE TO HELP US. We found a table, and sat down with fingers crossed that we would get service. By this time, we are starving.

The games on it are good for kids but not adults the trivia just keeps repeating. The wait staff just wants you to use them to reorder drinks and pay. It's a joke ! If you wanna pay with a card it's cool you swipe and go... But with cash you need to wait until the server spots your tablet flashing or until you can find them.

We went on Friday night and were surprised to get seated right away.  It took almost 45 minutes to get our food, though, and the whole time we were there (1:15 or so) there were 2 tables filled with dirty dishes, untouched.   The 2 tables that were pushed together for us each hosted an evil little computer squatter which was there to try to robotize the staff while selling the customer little games for $2.  It was supposed to be used to flag a wait person, reorder drinks, and swipe to pay at the end.  I think it led to worse service (""no one flagged me so I didn't check back"") and I would go to 5 Guys if I didn't want to get waited on (and I should have for the food this time!) and it crowded the already small table.  I am ticked at businesses that try to get rid of real people, when so many don't have a job, also, while trying to jack up the bill with little games,  discouraging people from actually talking during dinner (although it was so loud that we couldn't, really), and getting their squat little bases splashed with ketchup and grease.  The irony is that it didn't work when it came time to check out; somehow ours was supposed to be for another table across the restaurant, so the ""fast checkout"" actually slowed down 2 tables that night.  I guess the robots can't buss tables, either. Of course, eating out is about the food, right?  I was not that hungry (turned out to be a good thing!) and ordered a cup of clam chowder.  I had assumed that it would actually be a cupful; instead, it was 1/2"" of runny soup in a tiny square bowl that would have done well to hold a single lemon.  To add insult to injury, the square corners made it hard to get the last (11th---I counted) bite of soup.  It came with cold toast that was tasteless that sat there after the first bite.  My daughter's fries were cold, and my husband's salad was insipid. I've eaten there twice before since we moved here in July and those visits were OK, but this was the worst dining experience we have had in a long time and for the price we will either go to 5 Guys for better food at half the price or else to Mi Tierra, Benjarong, or Adam's bistro for a sit-down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe?start=60,1.84,1.84,1.84,1.956,1.8400000000000003

I don't have these problems at the other Red Robins, it had to be a fluke...right? Oh how very wrong I was. Decided to go here with my current girlfriend, and it was a terrible mistake. The waitress decided  not to write down our order, so of course she got the whole thing wrong. After an hour od waiting for food, and spotty service I was irritated, but let events take theur course. It was not until the third time my order came back wrong that I just gave up. It was shocking that the manager came and did not offer to comp the dishes, however you bet your bottom dollar he did when I lifted up my nasty wet burger bun! And again, we both got ill. I am alwats sweet to servers, and I am pretty chill about letting things slide...but the illnesses and weird service here outweighs the positives, even the poor server who had to keep apologizing for the kitchens mess. Go to a different Red Robin location... Or your bowels will regret it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe,2.44,2.44,2.44,1.7640000000000002,2.44

32,Sabrina R.,"Seattle, WA",0,8,4.0,1.0,2016-12-04,"I've never been to a red robin before. This will be my last trip. With a smile, I asked what the waitress' favorite drink was and she replied with: ""I don't have the drinks here. If I want to drink, I don't go to red robin."" She just seemed to have no time for our questions regarding the menu, and this caused a confusion in my drink order as well as making me feel very uncomfortable from the beginning. She brought our drinks and quickly left without even listening when I started to say I didn't order the drink she had brought. She returned with our food, and I finally had the chance to tell her I didn't want the drink she brought. She got upset, grabbed the unwanted drink, and then commented that it was what I pointed to on the menu. If she had taken just a few more seconds to listen to me, there wouldn't have been any confusion. I could hear her tell someone I didn't want that drink, and it made me worried that the correct drink would be spit in or something. I just wish I had not eaten there. People have bad days, I get it. But I was in a good mood at arrival. And left feeling very uneasy.

And let's be honest take away burgers and they have nothing left.  I ordered like normal food came out dry and overcooked I mean the meat was charred and no moisture at all.  I pointed this out to my waitress tonight 4 yes I said 4 times she offered nothing and did nothing. Did not ask if I wanted a replacement did not ask if I would like to speak to a manger..

And every time the server seems very indifferent about it. Don't get mad at me for the incompetence in your kitchen. Seems like they hire a lot of fast food cooks or something, although, you can get a much better burger for much less across the street at Carl's Jr.  On a side note, the lighting in the bar is egregiously bright. Also, patrons shouldn't have to tell employees what sporting event is on tv and ask to have the channel changed. You should have a schedule of all local and major sporting events and have them on. The crispy chicken sandwich is all I will eat anymore and it is the one bright spot on the menu.

15,Brit F.,"Yakima, WA",0,7,,1.0,2017-09-11,"Been going to Red Robin for years as my husband use to manage the one in our old town. Came to this one in monroe and it was honestly the worse service/food I have received in over 15 years of going to Red Robin's. When we were seated it took our server over 20 mins just to come to our table to offer water or introduce herself ( the hostess had stated they were busy) by then we knew what food we wanted so we ordered our food ( regular cheese burger and a tavern double) and our drinks ( freckled lemonade and poppin purple lemonade) after waiting another 20 mins the purple lemonade was brought out but no freckled lemonade (and still no waters) Roughly 10 mins later the other lemonade was brought to our table. Shortly after our food came. Tavern double was just as ordered, hot but had cold fries. Cheeseburger was cold and had nothing but cheese, meat and bread. Before I could even say anything the server walked off. Push the button on the tablet to call the server back and waited. And waited. And waited. To the point the call button went off. Finally a different server was walking by and my husband stopped her and asked for a manager. Her response? I'll see if we have one  So a few mins later the manager (Jake) comes out from the kitchen and we tell him the cheese burger has nothing on it, fries are cold, our drinks have never been refilled, still no waters and we can't seem to located our server. He apologizes and says he'll fix the burger. Goes to the back and comes out in recited time with a fresh cheeseburger stating I was luckily because someone had just ordered one and it was in the window! (So he stole someone else's food huh) Anyways he says sorry again and is off. So my husband is done with his food and tries to entertain our daughter while I eat. Our server finally shows up and asks how everything is. We say we need more drinks as we've only received 1 in such a long wait. She says ok and leaves. We never see her again. After about another 15 mins my husband gets up and goes to the back to get me a to go box (the whole time the call server light is flashing on our tablet because we repeatedly push it) I pack up my food, pay on the tablet and we leave. Still never seeing our server, still never getting a refill on our expensive drinks ($5 a piece) and still never getting even water. As we walk out the restaurant really isn't that busy. We see our server chatting it up with some guy at the bar and the hostess has also disappeared. I truly love Red Robin. It was our home and our family when my husband managed the restaurant where we use to live. I always recommended it for its food and service. But this one? This Red Robin in monroe? I wouldn't send my worse enemy there. Unless you enjoy wasting at least an hour of your life on severely crappy service, cold and wrong food or you just love dying of thirst this is not the place for you. I'm honestly sad and disappointed in my whole experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

2,Kimberly L.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,16,,2.0,2017-10-09,"Red Robin undoubtedly has good burgers. My boyfriend and I come here pretty much on a weekly basis and order the same burger. The last few visits though there's been a disconnect with the service and food. We've had to wait well over 30min and the last time it took that long for our waters to come and orders to get taken.  Tonight was kind of the last straw though. We sat in the bar hoping not to get missed this time, but instead had an incredibly rude waitress. We ended up speaking to the manager Jake. Usually we don't like to complain and aren't difficult to please (I just want a burger and fries!), but this waitress was something else. I still can't believe how blatantly rude she was.  The manager Jake is always hands on and hustling in the restaurant and catering to customers. It's very obvious he's the hardest working guy there. He ended up boxing our food up for us and taking care of the bill.  Not sure if we'll be back for a while though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

My friend and I wanted to order food to go, sit with a beer and munch on the bottomless fries as so frequently advertised, basically what this place is known for. I didn't have my ID, so we had to sit in the main dining area and placed our order to go. Not only did the food take at least 30 minutes to come out, but we had to request an order of fries three times. The server continued to forget so we had to keep asking,  then we finally got the smallest order of fries that we went through because our food took so long. Another server which looked like a manager asked if we needed anything and we asked for fries from her too. We never got our fries. When our food came, we let the server know we didn't get the sauces we asked for, and when she came back and asked if we needed anything, still no fries.  We were told they were coming and waited another few minutes before we decided apparently french fries are too difficult of a request so we were better off taking our food and going without wasting anymore of our time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monroe,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

I let them know that I can't eat it. (Also can't have deep fried anything) I get the burger back with a meat patty on it...... I was like okay. So I tell them again.. then it comes out a 3rd time.........they litterly just took the patty off. It was seriously greasy, smelled like meat and was super gross. So I'm a little pissed. I go tell them I would like my money back. As my table is done eating, and I am litterly still hungry. The manager tells me that they can just remake it. I tell them it's already been remade 3 times.

Hostess said that she would put me at a small table, and when the other one opened up, I would move to it. 30 minutes later, couple left and as I was packing my things to move, hostess seats other guests. Overall, this location has poor hospitality. When I was first seated, waitress immediately told me that the kitchen was slow and they were really busy.
