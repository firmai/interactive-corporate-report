So just keep that in mind. Burgers are great though, so are the appetizers (we love clam strips and onion rings). Drinks are delicious, milkshakes are great (if you like milkshakes, go for the endless refill, they will bring you a tin cup with another shake, it is just like buying two for the price of one). Bring some Tabasco sauce with you for burgers, I am not sure they have hot sauce available by request.

70,Abish O.,"Baltimore, MD",54,6,1.0,4.0,2012-10-09,"Want to start off by saying Red Robin is more of a 3. But a couple of factors made me bump it up to a 4.  -I tend to drink a lot of water while I eat, and my waitress never missed a beat on getting me a new glass of water, even though she was busy with other tables as well.  -The O's game and Towson University football game was on when I went, and we were seated with great views to see both. (O's won btw) -The other times I went to Red Robin we had a group of 12+. The waitress was more than happy to split the check for us individually. One time our group was too busy eating and talking that no one mentioned separate checks, but our waitress had the foresight to do so. You can read about the food on other reviews. They are known for their burgers and have a good variety of them, but I just wanted to highlight some of the customer service and the other bits that make this establishment so great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=40,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004

Service is rather inconsistent. Some waiters/waitresses are amazing, others ignore you and look like they hate their job. Probably depends on the time of day you come in. Later at night seems to be the busier, but better serving time. I've probably had better burgers in my life but these certainly aren't the worst either.

We came on a Saturday night and even at 8 pm it was pretty crowded!!  We had to wait 10 minutes for a table, ordered right away, and then waited probably another 30 minutes for our food. My only issue was that I asked for no mayo on my burger and it still came with mayo :o(  So even though I was STARVING I had to spend the first 5 minutes after getting my food scraping the mayo off of the top and the bottom bun of my burger. You can also ask for some fixings for FREE!  Like I asked for some red onions for my burger and they came free of charge. I ordered the turkey burger (... with no mayo...) and I got a side salad instead of the bottomless steak fries.  You can get a bottomless side salad OR bottomless steamed broccoli to substitue for your fries if you're feeling healthy, which I think is a great option!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=20,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

27,Lily R.,"Bethesda, MD",144,135,360.0,2.0,2013-12-03,"Red Robin, Red Robin. You used to be amazing, so amazing. But these last few visits have been a grave disappointment. Every time it's like they've found a new trick to cut corners. The quantity of the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer has diminished noticeably at each visit it the last year or so, until my most recent visit where the portion was comically small, in a dish approximately the size of a large ramekin, and only filled halfway. It also tasted like the frozen dip you can get at the supermarket. Likewise, the burgers have shrunk. They try to trick you by using a large bun, but the quantity of meat is definitely less. They also give you less fries, and although they are still bottomless, they make sure to never ask if you want more. They must have some sort of policy like, don't remind the customers about the fries! so you have to actively seek out a server and request your extra fries, which makes you feel like maybe you shouldn't have more fries. I also ordered a salad there recently and it was way too small for a fairly expensive price. All the prices seem inflated for the food quantity.  They recently did some sort of image overhaul where they redid the menu and added a lot of options. The burgers are still delicious (whiskey river BBQ burger is the best!) But I think I can probably find a comparable restaurant where you don't feeling like you're being cheated. I think I'm done. Quit being so cheap, Red Robin.

75,Glenn M.,"Baltimore, MD",2,33,,2.0,2014-01-13,"I was going to rate 3 stars, but decided it needed to be dropped down to 2 ... more on that in a bit. Ironically, I don't like many of the burgers here.  They all look 100% better in the beautiful images they post in their adds and on their menus. When I get a burger, it looks nothing like the pictures I was fooled with, and the taste is never anything earth shattering. I'll just stick to 5 Guys for burgers intermixed with occasional late night runs for a double whopper with cheese @ BK. Now (again ironically) here is what I love about red Robin - their fish & chips is FABULOUS. Some of the best fish & chips I've found about town. I take the family to RR on occasion knowing I can always get my fish & chips and I'll be happy. I also just learned about the bottomless fries, and they have decent fries here ... we  just ask for more fries *immediately* after the server delivers our food, again after 5-10 minutes, whether we're ready for more or not, and again before we leave when I replenish along with half the fish & chips I saved for the journey home. Good way to squeeze out a little more value. Now as to why only 2 stars ... every time we come here, we are waiting 10-15 minutes on average while we are looking at a restaurant with 10-15 clean, open tables right in the middle of the place. If I owned this place, I'd be going  nuts thinking about the lost revenue while people turn and walk out because they can't seem to get seated at one of the dozen or more open tables ... and we've seen many people do this.

We were seated immediately in the bar section and greeted by our friendly server, Natty.  We had a decent sized booth for just the two of us, we got an appetizer, beer, and split a whiskey river BBQ salad. The appetizer, towering onion rings, is one of my a favorites. And we followed that up with the salad, split between the two of us. Perfect amount of food to fill us up. The onion rings came out very quick, they were hot and tasty!  Salad was delicious and I took the rest of mine home as leftovers. The place was clean, the food was delivered by two different people, both very friendly. And the hostess that sat us was friendly as well. The place is good for kids and groups ... I don't think they take reservations though - but if you have a large party, I would recommend calling ahead so they can get the tables together.  All time favorite is still the Whiskey River BBQ chicken burger, bottomless fries, with a side of (amazing) honey mustard poppyseed dressing. I've been to Red Robin in Owings Mills/Towson several times, and it's nice to see that over the years the food continues to come out exactly the same. Every now and then there are specials (I think there's a delicious burger that comes out around October) - but I can always count on the meal looking and tasting like it did the last time.

We think that the service was bad because we came in at a weird hour (like mid afternoon, probably around when the high school gets out) and maybe the servers don't give a damn around then because they are used to being shafted by kids? I dunno.

Like I said, everything was great....until they charred my burger. I tried to eat some of it, thinking maybe it was just blackened. Nope charred. It was inedible and ended up having to send it back.

I went to a Red Robin two almost three years ago in a another city, in a another state. After that horrible visit I promised I would NEVER visit another Red Robin again. I should've just stuck with that and Not went but after seeing the bottomless fries commercial over and over and over again I was now craving the fries! So I took my family. Our service started off HORRIBLE, It took us 5-10 minutes to get seated and the sad part is, they weren't that busy or understaffed and we were the only ones that walked in. After we were seated it took more than 20 minutes to have our server greet us and introduce her self to us! I wasn't happy about that our service started off horrible! That strawberry lemonade they have is disgusting and they should stop serving it but to each it's own! I ordered our appetizers and it took a minute for us to order them because the server kept walking past us and not tending to us at all to be honest! It was more so like ""oh I forgot I have those customers too"", We didn't order food when we were ready because again she kept walking past us like we were invisible, It's funny cause I'm always the one needed to be rushed and to make a decision and I had enough time to make a decision and decide EXACTLY what I wanted! That never happens..lol anyway We were never offered refills on drinks that were refillable but she made sure to tell us which drinks weren't refillable! Our food finally arrived and it was warm, Our appetizers here hotter than the food! No wait I take that back the spiciness of the buffalo sauce was hotter than our food and that's just disappointing,our fires were lukewarm. I was not impressed at all! it actually made me mad! At the end of it all we took two bites an packed everything up, My older children ate their tenders thank god and my youngest had a burnt dry burger! SMH!!!  It looKed as if none on the staff last night was over 25 and if they were they sure didn't act like it and they seems to be playing and chatting a lot! There was even a random guy over behind the counters in a red,blue and white hoodie I may be off about the colors but anyway he was over there chomping away at food and standing near ours! I was unsure if he was a worker that was off for the night or if he was a friend of a worker that was getting off soon but it was very unsanitary an awkward. I feel like i wasted so much money there last night. I barely are anything! I went home hungry. I must say though even though our server didn't deserve a tip I left her one and I also left het a nice note on the napkin under her tip that ""THE SERVICE HERE SUCKS"" Honest and truthful  Will not be getting our business again!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.052,2.88

My friend was craving their onion rings and was told they were sold out. Our server said Valentine's Day ""did them in."" I'm sorry but Valentines Day was 6 days ago. What, no food deliveries in 6 days? Not her fault but still unacceptable. I ordered a side salad and my friend chose the mozzarella sticks. She enjoyed hers. The salad was just meh. Typical side salad, however it arrived without dressing. Another person dumped it in front of me and abruptly turned on her heels to return to the kitchen. I had to call out to get her attention to please bring the salad dressing. After another 5 minutes, she returned. The waitress eventually returned to take the rest of our order. Our appetizer and salad plates were not removed until our meal arrived. My friend ordered pickles with her burger and when it was delivered was told they were out of pickles! My gosh, there's a grocery store located in the same shopping center for pete's sake! Again, not the server's fault. I ordered mayo on the side... guess what? You got it... not there. I had to ask and wait for another 5 minutes for it to arrive. The fries were cold, my friends burger was hot. Mine was barely warm after waiting for the mayo. The LT and onion were just sad. One small pic of lettuce, 2 VERY thin slices of tomato and literally 4 thin slices of red onion for the entire burger. I only ate half bc it was so salty and my friend said her was completely tasteless. The manager asked us how our meal was and when expressed our concerns he said we were really busy yesterday.
