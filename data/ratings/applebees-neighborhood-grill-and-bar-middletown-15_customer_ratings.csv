32,Gina-Marie M.,"Boston, MA",384,125,6.0,3.0,2013-01-14,Came here for dinner tonight with the boy and it was very enjoyable. Our waitress was super cute and enthusiastic as well as check on us regularly. We both got steak and ordered it medium well and they were a little over cooked but over all not a big deal. I also got a side garden salad and though it looked good it didn't taste that good. I really enjoyed the brownie bite and over all I think we will come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15?start=20,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002
25,Richard L.,"Newark, NJ",5,78,20.0,4.0,2013-04-18,"It's an Applebee's and an okay one so you'll get what you expect from a chain restaurant.   The location isn't bad, service has always been good in my experiences, and the food/drink is fine.  You probably won't really find significantly better quality food in the Newport area restaurants.   Presentation and ambiance are obviously higher end at those restaurants, but this Applebee's will fill you up and provide a place for you to hang out with friends, etc.  I don't know why the previous reviews were so bad.  I've been here multiple times and have always had good experiences.   Get yourself a pitcher of sangria and some appetizers during their happy hour and you'll be a happy camper.  Entree wise the dishes are what you'd expect.  They can be a bit greasier, but you can mitigate that with your menu selection.   Not a bad choice all things considered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16

30,John T.,"Stuart, FL",38,4,,1.0,2013-11-07,Just bad. The bartender did not care. My medium rare steak was well done. I hate to waste food so just ate it. My choice of Newcastle ale was ridiculed. The thing that bothered me most is that she never asked me how things were. She was too busy to check on me and the bar wasn't busy at all. I would have liked desert or an after dinner drink before I walked to my hotel but nothing. So I put my credit card on the bar and got back a soaking wet pen and receipt. Not a good experience. Aside from the steak being well done the salad and mashed potatoes were as expected.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15?start=20,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

17,Vezna S.,"Winthrop, MA",123,397,105.0,2.0,2014-08-26,"The only saving grace about this place was their bartender at the time. I entered the place and waited a good amount of time to be seated, even though it wasn't that busy. I asked for take-out and was directed to the bar area.  There I was helped by quite a friendly bartender who took my order before helping and mingling with other patrons. It was a LONG wait for the food but I could tell that the bartender actually cared about when it was coming. She was persistently asking the servers and the manager to look into the food and I know for a fact they didn't even bother because no one ever came back to say anything because i was sitting right next to the bartender the whole time. She probably asked 4 times until she went back there herself and got it.  Horrible customer service is a deal breaker for repeat visits. Also, the food was pretty bland. The boneless hot wings were far from spectacular. Microwaved taste and it was cold in the center on some of them so you know it was just popped in the microwave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.8320000000000003

Ordered boneless chicken wings and the 2 for $20.00 deal.  Bartender was not that approachable or friendly. It was kind of weird because we have a bartender serve us and then a food server serve us drinks at the bar, then  a food server take our order at the bar.. All in all, the food came out pretty quickly but the attitude of the bartender just really annoyed me. Bartenders should be open, upbeat and friendly..

19,Jamel F.,"Newport, RI",1,9,1.0,2.0,2015-03-15,"Food is average but not better than Chile's, which is up the road. Prices are decent and drinks are ok. Their downfall is the service. Service was not up to par to other restaurants on the island. Staff are inexperienced and seem lazy and don't want to be there.  Unfortunately the Staff may be lacking due to leadership non existent care of customers experience. My nachos were cold and I brought to attention of waiter. My nachos were the wrong size so when they brought my new hot nachos it was the size of what I paid for and when manager brought them he just said here you go and placed them on table. He didn't ask how I was doing or nothing. Just walked away knowing I had an inexperienced waiter. I will never visit this restaurant. There's too many better restaurants on the island.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15,,,,,

7,Liz M.,"North Providence, RI",131,346,375.0,4.0,2015-06-02,Where to go when it's ten pm and your hungry and need a cocktail? Applebee's. I was obsessed with this place in my twenties and got the to go all the time. Now that I'm older my palate is a little more refined. However this is still a great place to get an appetizer or drink. It's affordable too. Half Priced appetizers after nine pm is always nice. This particular location is always clean. The service is great. They are quick to greet and wait on you. Cheryl is usually the bartender there and she is a gem. She remembers what I like to drink and eat and she's also got a great personality. There seem to be a lot of regulars and she knows them all.  She makes sure the drinks are kept full and also chats with everyone which is nice when dining alone.  The only reason for the four stars instead of five is I'd really like to see more craft beers available there. I know it's a chain but would be great to have a local beer option especially with Newport storm being right down the road. If your in the Middletown area and need a quick drink and snack go see Cheryl. She will take great care of You. !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15,,,,,
16,Lady B.,"Newport, RI",0,25,5.0,1.0,2015-06-02,"ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH !  IF I could give none I would.  We ordered 3 burgers off their menu with no special requests.  Our order arrived & we thought someone was playing a joke...3 PLAIN burgers on a PLAIN bun !  NO lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, bacon, ""special sauce"" as advertised...NOTHING !   Burgers got cold and our toddlers 1 & 3 were done eating & climbing the walls when we finally got hold of the manager. We could not wait for a total reorder and left without eating. The table in back of us called the manager for a problem with their rib order and a table horizontal we saw the manager take the whole plate away.  A party of 4 got up and left when they saw all this going on before ordering, -lucky them !

6,Average J.,"Seekonk, MA",2,58,119.0,2.0,2015-07-30,"This location is not horrible, but it certainly could have been better. It was empty except for a few booths and a few seats at the bar. We stopped in of super-early bird dinner with the kids. Their meals were fine (mac & cheese with yogurt and strawberries as the side).  The Triple Hog Dare Ya - wasn't much of a dare at all. The commercials on TV and the new menu spread make it seem like you taking on a big meal. It was just OK, a small-ish bun with the three pork layers, cheddar cheese, and thin onion rings. The onion rings by themselves were great. The BBQ sauce on this is too overpowering and took all the flavor away from the meat. I could only taste sauce. I would not order it again.  I would talk about the club sandwich, but it was just a club - nothing great, nothing to complain about. The new BBQ fries taste like Lay's BBQ chips. Pretty tasty, but I can only take a few before I'm tapped out on the BBQ flavor. I recommend a half plain & half BBQ order of fries to balance the flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15,,,,,

I'm usually not the girl to post something like this, but a different heart string was pulled this time considering that I just quit working for the Applebee's company in my hometown after years of giving my all to them & the mere fact that I work very close with children with Autism every day being a special education teacher.

The older couple sitting behind me also had a great server.  I listen as she walked that couple through the menu and helped them make decisions they were ultimately happy with.  It was a challenge for sure.  So, my opinion is the serving staff is sound. The kitchen seemed a bit slow, the table and menu were sticky, and the food wasn't great.  The food was just ok... My go to salad had to be sent back because it was soaked in dressing and appeared to be made of scraps.  It came back better.

8,Amanda J.,"Worcester, MA",0,4,,1.0,2016-04-01,"bless the servers heart, she tries and it is not her fault whatsoever that this place is HORRIBLE. they are sorely understaffed and it is clear the kitchen staff needs to be washed out and redone! Our nacho appetizer was gross, the ""beef"" was clearly old and it was hard and cold by the time it got to us. My steak was good and cooked exactly how I asked (only good thing), the ""bacon cheddar"" potatoes were home fries with a little shredded cheese over them, so disappointing. The ""steamed broccoli"" HAD to have been ran under the faucet and put on the plate, it was SOAKED. It is a Friday night and you'd think ok they are slammed have some patience, right? WRONG! The place is maybe halfway filled and these employees are running around crazy and being double-triple sat, they really don't have a chance.  HOWEVER, my daughters kids meal, Kraft Mac and cheese with FF was a hit (go figure!) she loved it. Which was wonderful to me. I have been here once before and the experience was 100X worse - tried again only due to convenience and time! - this time wasn't as bad, by I will steer clear of this place from now on, no matter what!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15,,,,,

Restaurant conveniently located next to Howard Johnson and looks nice; however, my ""Perfect Margarita"" was weak and way overpriced and my French Onion soup was inedible.  One of the ingredients was stale or spoiled.  I sent it back with the waiter and asked for the manager.   Michelle Lakefield, the manager, was unhelpful. She was argumentative and wasn't interested in finding out if there was a problem with the soup. She didn't bother to apologize for the problem.  I ordered a tomato bisque soup as a replacement.

Our server was very pleasant. We got our drinks and apps and they were great. We got our burgers and after my husband took a few bites of his burger, a long kinky hair was half in his mouth and it had been cooked into the burger. Yuck. The minute we both saw it, we threw our burgers down on our plate while our stomachs turned. We couldn't finish either of our meals after that. I mean noone can after finding a hair cooked into their burger, right? The server got the manager and they took the cost of the burger off the menu and gave us a coupon for a free app next time we come. I just was so disappointed. Ruined our appetite.

I have not been to an Applebee's in over 6 years because they were really crappy then. Now, for $20 for an appetizer and dinner for two, it isn't bad. Unfortunately, the place is packed here, people don't know how to manage their kids so their is always a baby screaming. The service here was really nice, it seems that Applebee's is trying to improve their food by cutting prices, but unfortunately, by doing that now the place is packed with people who don't really manage children well resulting in a horribly loud environment. The waitress's eye's looked like she was in a prison, with a constant drowning wailing of children's screams from the other table. I felt kind of bad, the chow was decent we ordered but the lasting memory in my mind was the tables of family's with kids making scenes and parents not taking them outside or trying to pacify them.

Our server didn't go over any of their specials.  She also rolled her eyes and said ""oh Jesus"" when we had the audacity to ask for water.   I knew Applebee's was terrible going in, but I guess I hoped it wouldn't be a caricature of bad American suburban cuisine.   The only reason I give them two stars is that they have a nifty device at the table that enables you to pay for the items that you ordered.  This works well for large parties, but it also probably cultivates server laziness...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-middletown-15,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
