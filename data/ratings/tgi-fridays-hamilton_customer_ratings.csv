21,Bob C.,"Riverside, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2012-10-07,"3 of us went to this place last night.  It's on 130 South near the Hamilton Marketplace adjacent to a Hilton hotel.  They weren't busy at all.  We sat at a high-top in the bar area and got this real spacey guy who was impersonating a server.  We ordered a couple of apps and they were not good at all.  ""Server-guy"" then took our order and didn't write it down. 25 minutes later, I'm asking where our food is and he seemed perplexed.....it didn't come out for another 10 or 15 minutes!  This guy must have never placed the order but wouldn't fess up. My girlfriend is allergic to red peppers and asked that her pasta dish did not include them but of course they did.  I ordered the ""sizzling"" fajitas and it was a lump of nasty sliced steak with zero sizzle - it was awful!  I've never had this experience at a Friday's before but rest assured I'll never go back to this one!  Terrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton?start=40,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005

The problem at this location is that the service is horrible. I had dinner there the other night and Lara was our server. She seemed either like she was high or just didn't care about her job (I couldn't figure out which). She kept forgetting things throughout the night, like we all ordered drinks and she never brought them. We eventually got them from another server, and she came over really confused that she hadn't written down our drink order. She brought out the wrong dessert and then charged us for it. She was just all over the place. In the end, it was almost comical how bad of a server she was.

It was on the menu as a ""southwest chicken"" quesadilla and described as ""spicy."" It was certainly not spicy at all, and I've had much better quesadillas from Wawa! The French fries were decent. The iced tea was different each time I got it. My first drink was OK, and when I got a refill it was like the iced tea was transparent. I drank it and it was not good; it tasted like water.

35,Margaret G.,"Keansburg, NJ",0,1,,2.0,2014-05-14,"I has originally posted this on Facebook but my oldest son said I should post it here so here goes ... My son Dave, my sister in law Carol and I went to TGI Fridays for dinner and had the oddest experience. It must have been Carol's fault because .. Well, just because, LOL! Anyway, our waiter was a cute little Spanish guy named Sergio who may or may not have been new but was completely devoid of any charm or personality ... or sense of humor because he laughed at none of my jokes. Which would have been fine because the food was good and served in a timely fashion. But then dessert happened and another family came into his section and apparently, he had some sort of breakdown and I am imagining ran out through the kitchen screaming and they had to send a freakin posse to round him up and drag him back. Dave and I each ordered pb chocolate pie. We waited an eternity before a different waiter came with one tiny piece of pie and two forks. He then announced ""I have no idea where your waiter is!"" So we look around and pointed him out and Dave said, um, we ordered two pieces of pie, one each."" I mean seriously, I have posted pictures of myself and family on here. Do we LOOK like we share one tiny piece of pie? So I am waiting for my pie for another eternity. Dave was done, Carol was on her third beer. I was going to ask for a glass of water but since Sergio had disappeared, I just waited for the ice in my tea to melt. Finally my pie arrives. Like NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. Alrighty then. I asked Dave to ask for the check while we excused ourselves to the powder room, where Carol had no idea how to work the paper towel dispenser and thought she broke it because I can't take her anywhere without some odd thing happening. So we go back to the table, the bill is there and we are waiting for Sergio to come and settle up. I asked Dave if he remembered the line from Backdraft where the guy says, ""You see that flash of light in the corner of your eye? That's your career dissipation light. It just went into high gear."" Well, that was how I felt about the tip. Every tick it was getting smaller. We finally walked out to the hostess desk to pay and the other guy who brought the pie had a questioning look on his face. We asked if we could pay there and he said we had to pay our server. I said if you can find him, I will. So ... ... ... Finally he comes and takes the bill (LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED) and my card and it's over. I told him the tip was on the table. I left him $13 because I hope it's bad luck in his culture and that will teach him. I should have drawn an evil eye on the check. The food was really good, work on the service/waitstaff!

I went to TGI Fridays with my family for the reason being every restaurant was ridiculously packed and were desperate so figured Fridays would be a good choice. We thought so wrong. The wait for the table wasn't bad at all. We get seated and to be greeted took 10 minutes. I wish I remembered her name but short blonde hair looked extremely sloppy and not how a real server should present themselves. There is no service here at all. She was not attentive at all. We all needed to drinks and our server was no where to be found. Once we finally found her we didnt get our drinks for another 7-10 minutes!!! We had no silver ware what so ever after the food was brought out. Not to forget that they brought out everyones entree except for my dads waited another 10 minutes our food was cold by then. Then the salmon was extremely over cooked. Had to wait for a new one. The manger whoever the bald gentleman was not sincere i saw him make a face once walking towards the kitchen.

People were missing food. One of the drink glasses was completely cracked. The water tasted foul. We had to ask the manager for refills on drinks; no one checked up us.

Working behind the bar area.  Did a really nice job BUT we had a question for another waitress there who was passing by our table while this young man was in the kitchen.   She cut us off mid question (just asking about what items were available on their Endless Apps menu) and walked away as we were talking to her.     Rude as can be.  Shameful really.  Manager needs to have a lil chat with this one!!  We were not complaining. We were friendly. No need to be rude.  Further she was talking about us to the table behind us.

7,David H.,"Trenton, NJ",128,928,673.0,4.0,2016-01-17,"I believe they have successfully reinvented themselves. Yes they've long been an established fast casual chain known more for their commercials on TV for 474 lunch deals, endless apps and other types of hype to bring in clientele. I can only remember them having greasy appetizers, weak overpriced drinks and not being vegetarian friendly. That has all changed. They were fined several years ago for watering down their alcohol and seem to have served their sentence. The drinks now are taller, stronger and tasty. During happy hour, they're even reasonable. While my wife had the raspberry margarita, I stuck to the beer. They even had some beer specials. Nice to see they have some craft beer on tap and in bottles. Such as Stone IPA, Laganitas on draft and Widmer Omission in bottles. Lots of TV's all over the place for watching sports, etc.  For dinner we started with the spinach and artichoke flatbread as an app. I had the Bourbon Barrel Chicken which was one of the lowest price and calorie on the menu. Served on a small wooden plank, you can taste the brown sugar they use and not so much the bourbon. For sides, I recommend the tomato and mozzarella salad which is made with chopped red onions similar to a caprese salad. The second side I chose the higher calorie cheddar mac & cheese.  We were only looking for a place to hang and watch the NFL playoff games where it wouldn't be too loud and rowdy. While I'm not a big fan of fast casual chains, I was impressed with their new menu, the great service and friendly atmosphere. They now have vegetarian options as well such as black bean burgers anyway you want them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998

The only thing keeping this place alive is the bar. The mixed drinks were great! But that's it. Our server told us that they are always understaffed. That explains the amount of time we waited for our food, but not the exquisitely poor quality. We got our entrees before the appetizer and before the soup. Our app and soup came out moments later. It took 15 minutes to bring us silverware, AFTER our entire meal was served. The cheeseburger sliders were past well done; nearly inedible. The soup was ok, but really salty. My wife's meal was terrible. Steak was tough and chewy, potatoes were like glue, broccoli was sour and rubbery. My fajitas were bad. Steak was tough, rice was undercooked, pico de gallo was awful, and I got a TON of lettuce. We're never coming back. We are, however, handing the bartender $7 in singles (all we have) and telling him that he is the only reason we stayed for dinner. Two groups of patrons, that we witnessed, got up and left after being seated. Either because their server took so long to greet them and take their drink order, or because the food took so long to leave the kitchen.

Half the tables were empty. So we sat at the tall table and waiting and waited some more. Finally after 15 minutes, the waitress stops by. She was clearly over worked & stressed. The first thing she did was tell me how busy they are and understaffed. Because we were seated during ""Happy Hour"" We ordered appetizers and two sodas. It took 35-40 minutes for the food to arrive. By this time my son had a headache and wanted to just leave. The table next to us was waiting also. She was told after her 25 minute wait that they ""ran out of hamburgers"" Seriously. So back to our issue: OUR food arrived medium warm at the most. The chicken bites were hard and appeared to be microwaved. I asked for the check and she dropped it off but disappeared again. She did not ring up our bill with Happy Hour appetizer prices.  After the aggravation we had, I was not going to argue the point. We just wanted to pay & leave and never return. I approached the bartender and asked her to ring up my bill. It was $45.69 and I had 3 twenty dollar bills. She replied - I will get your waitress. Hmm? WHY? SO the waitress finally returns and takes my $60 and returns with $14.00 - No change. Hmm? WHY? She explained that she has no change and only the bartender can give coins. So she rounded my change to just $14 no coins. Hmm? I have never heard of this policy. Must be nice to keep other peoples coins.....Note to self and others on YELP - Avoid this TGIF. Go home and eat cold cereal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
2,Laura H.,"Browns Mills, NJ",0,30,53.0,1.0,2017-06-04,"Went to dinner last night with a big group of friends and we were all dissapointed with the food quality.   I can honestly say the food was not what I expected.  I've been to Friday's several of times, but this one in particular was horrible. I ordered the JD Ribeye with shrimp.  Mind you it cost $25.00 for this dinner and it was  deceiving.  I asked for my steak to be medium well, it came out black and dehydrated looking.  It was so chewy it was like eating shoe leather.   My two ice cream scoop looking mashed potatoes were dried out from sitting in the window that they  had a crust on them.  It also had broccoli on the plate with a wedge of lemon.  The lemon that was on my plate looked like it was used to clean the grill and then put on my plate. Very disappointing..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
10,Skullrose R.,"South Amboy, NJ",27,6,,2.0,2017-06-21,"Gave it three tries! 1st attempt salad was rotted, 2nd attempt jd steak tasted like I imagine a shoe would and last but not least the 3rd and final attempt they ran out of burgers. How does a chain restaurant run out of beef pattys? A 4th attempt is definitely not in my future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
8,SK K.,"Irvington, NY",46,21,2.0,1.0,2017-06-27,Ate here last night after a great day at 6flags. Only wish it had a better ending. I asked my family to personally shame me if we ever go to another Friday's. Cathy our server was the lobe bright spot. The food the menu and overpriced apps are ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

13,Emily L.,"West Babylon, NY",13,1,,1.0,2017-07-19,"It took an hour for the food to come after we ordered. Waiter was very nice but place was extremely understaffed and very inconvenient considering it was 10:30 at night and they claimed it was just a ""busy night"" but the place was empty.  Had just finished day at six flags and the kids were very tired. Usually love this place but was extremely unsatisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
15,Kathy S.,"Pennington, NJ",36,3,,1.0,2017-08-10,Stood at the hostess booth for 10-15 mins.  Was never greeted by anyone.  Several servers walked by us and saw us waiting and didn't even acknowledge us.  So we left.  Probably won't return:(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

12,Wayne D.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7,38,20.0,1.0,2017-10-03,"I thought that I'd try this place despite its low rating. It was close to the hotel and I wanted to watch the game. It was absolutely horrible! They advertise that you can watch a game here but that's a lie. The beer was good but that's it. The manager apologized about the game and then did nothing! Be warned, don't eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
1,Bill E.,"Woodstock, IL",1,3,,1.0,2017-11-11,Ok. Ha.  Seriously.  This place does not give a shit about the food.  Let's just rake in $ on our expensive overpriced foo-foo drinks.  Staying at hotel next door. So first night was the ribeye and lobster.  Waited 45 min for that.  Fine.  But when I got it  it was all cold.  Crunched in some noodles in he Mac n cheese also. (Not cooked. Cold). Oh and the lobster tail was cold. Everything was.  Anyways.  Came back tonight.  Second try.  Just a 10 oz ribeye with mashed.   BUT......they seemed to think I don't know the diff between a ribeye and a crappy piece of sirloin!!! Seriously. What bad luck I've had here.   Positive note- the waitresses are super busy and always moving. It's hard. It's busy.  Butt the chef (if that's what they're called here) knew the difference in ............screw it.  I'll never come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
