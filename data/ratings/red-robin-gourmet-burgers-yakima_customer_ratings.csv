49,Corinne M.,"Tacoma, WA",488,532,119.0,4.0,2012-01-06,"I grew up going to this place. I moved away 10 years ago, and I still manage to make my way back. I stopped at another burger joint on my way home last weekend, because it was closer to the freeway, and I regretted it.  The reasons that I love Yakima Red Robin: 1. There is usually a wait, not long, but I've learned that there is a wait for a reason, people want to be there, because they are doing things right.  2. ALL of the staff is ALWAYS friendly, you genuinely feel welcome.  3. No matter how busy they are, you get good service. 4. The prices and portions are appropriate.  5. The food is GREAT! 6. The atmosphere and the decor is PERFECT for a burger establishment. 7. They are the BEST for making special occasions important.  8. I leave feeling full, and happy, I get what I payed for.  I should have written this a long time ago, I should not have waited for a bad experience elsewhere to realize how much I appreciate my experiences here.  I have been, and will be a life long customer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima?start=40,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

44,Megan S.,"Pasco, WA",18,327,37.0,3.0,2012-08-17,"The food here was good, but the service was not. This is sad, because Mikayla started out so well. She brought fries for munching until our food came out and was prompt with refills (even though she switched some of our drinks). However, once the food arrived for 5/6 of us, she disappeared. Fifteen minutes after my mother-in-law insisted we go ahead and start without her, she was sitting awkwardly (and hungrily) without a salad. Since no server was in sight for several minutes, my father-in-law ventured to the kitchen to see what the deal was. Five minutes later, the salad arrived and my MIL started her meal as everyone else was finishing.  A few minutes later, the manager came over and offered to take $5 off the cost of the salad due to the delay, which was appreciated. Red Robin, please, if timing isn't your kitchen's forte, please know that I would rather everyone's food sit under the heat lamp for a short time than see my MIL sit without food for 15+ while everyone else eats. It's so incredibly rude to serve part of a table!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima?start=40,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

I wanted very badly to send it back, but we couldn't wait to leave. I'm old enough to remember the original Red Robin in the University district. The trick was you tried to eat the burger without asking for a fork to finish. Well, those days are gone. This thing was dry as a bone, no mayo, and the ""endless"" fries are a joke.

23,Kelly J.,"Yakima, WA",1,45,16.0,3.0,2014-06-02,"I will begin this review by saying that I am a huge fan of red robin food. Their burgers are delicious every time!  Why only three stars? Because the service at this location is extremely hit and miss. Sometimes you get a really good, attentive waiter or waitress, but this is not always the case. For example, my boyfriend and I went here for date night. Our first disappointment came when they sat us between two children's birthday parties (despite the restaurant not being very busy). Then we waited for about 15 minutes before our waitress came over, the hostess had to take our drink orders! Then, when our absentee waitress did decide to show up, she was less than wonderful. She got snippy with me when I asked for no tomato on my burger. And then she took forever to bring refills, sauces, etc. Not cool.  Another thing worth mentioning, I used the rest room on this visit and it was DISGUSTING!!!! This usually isn't something I knit-pick because I know restaurants get busy but this was particularly bad especially considering it wasn't that busy! And like I said sometime you get lucky and get an amazing server but sometimes you have an experience like this. But in my opinion the food is worth it.  Bottom line: great food, spotty service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

Fries were consistently cold and soggy despite being ""endless."" Our server was nice and clearly lacking support.

56,K M.,"Yakima, WA",9,4,,4.0,2015-03-15,"So on Friday I took the oldest to Red Robin to get a quick bite to eat before helping at movie night. We were a bit apprehensive as our last visit was so terrible. We got there at nearly the same time as the last visit (5:00) and unlike our last trip there were hardly anyone in the restaurant or waiting for a table. I surmised this was because of all the poor service and poor reviews. I let our waiter know we were in a hurry and he was very nice and promptly took our order. I ordered sweet potato fries for Ashley and we both got soup. So, nothing spectacular nor nothing that would need to take a lot of cooking. Our service was fantastic. The app came quickly and then the soup. I mad a point to tell the server when I gave him my discount card (mailed after I sent a scathing email to their corporate people after the last visit) about how pleased I was with the service. He brought the manager over and we had a long talk about the last visit and the noticeable changes. Turns out the manager is new, he was promoted 2 months ago. I told him that I would be sure to write a good review on facebook and on yelp to let people know they are improving. He acknowledged the buildings design is ridiculous and that there were lots of issues with new servers not having the personalities or ability to provide good service.

It took almost 15 mintues for the beer to arrive once ordered, the burgers came about 25 mintues later and the extra fries we ordered when they dropped the burgers off at the table came when we were ready to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
19,Elizabeth B.,"Ellensburg, WA",5,22,,2.0,2016-03-07,"We decided to get takeout and I wanted to see if they have improved since their reopening. I can say, no they haven't. Soggy, cold fries, soggy buns, burnt burger patty and way over salted turkey burger patty. Spending over $30, we should receive at least hot food. Another lesson learned. No more Red Robin for this family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

15,ariel b.,"Moses Lake, WA",3,27,10.0,1.0,2016-12-03,"We went on a Saturday afternoon and while it was busy it wasn't packed; yet it took over a half hour to seat our party of 5 adults and 4 children even though I could clearly see tables empty that could have been pushed together. At least 5 smaller parties who arrived after us were seated before we were. We almost left to go somewhere else and I wish we had because the food was definitely not worth the wait. Our drinks came quickly but the food took another 1/2 hour and one of the burgers had to be sent back because the server had entered the wrong one so mom waited an extra 15min for her burger. All the burgers were over cooked and dry - even the croissant sandwich my niece ordered was dry (super stale croissant). I ordered a bottomless drink and when I got it I thought it tasted strange - my sister took a sip and told me it was alcoholic: I don't drink ever and had to send the drink back and wait for another. When our food came out, it came without utensils or napkins. We had 9 people needing napkins and forks and we couldn't flag the waitress, who -bless her heart was trying her best to wait too many tables at once, so my husband got up and hunted down utensils and napkins and brought them back to our table. Oh, and my sisters Cesar salad was saaaad - how are there no croutons in a Cesar salad?!? The kids enjoyed their kids meals (though my nephew said his sprite tasted weird which it did and had to be sent back as well). For the price, neither the food nor the service was worth it. Next time we will go to Mod Pizza across the way or the Kabob House on the other side, and if I'm craving a burger I'll hit Bobs or even Burger King, which would be better. Very disappointing - we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
10,Jeanne B.,"Moses Lake, WA",0,7,,1.0,2016-12-03,I have been to several Red Robin restaurants and have been pleased with the service and the food. This one however will never have my business again.

12,Gary G.,"Yakima, WA",0,15,,5.0,2017-01-25,"My wife and I have been really impressed with RR. We went in for the first time in their new location several weeks ago. We had stopped going to their former location due to two experiences with extremely poor service.  Things have changed dramatically for the better as we have been back to RR 6 times in the past two two months. The service is quick, friendly, and the bar menu double burgers are perfect for us to split with the bottomless fries.  Local brew on tap is a total bonus; I mean who doesn't love a Top Cutter with a burger!   We plan to make RR a regular eatery for lunches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
3,Matt U.,"Yakima, WA",371,1240,2207.0,4.0,2017-02-24,"Well it's undergone a number of renovations and facelifts, this red Robin has been a staple in the area for a long time and continues to deliver on its promise of delicious burgers and lots of fries! In its new building, the place seems to have a smaller footprint, but actually boasts more seating and room for customers. Standard dining rooms, as well as a nice bar area to the left. They do a good job of getting people in and out quickly, and the servers are always friendly, often bringing you extra fries and your choice of sauce! It's the little things after all. We always appreciate the rotating selection of burgers and the fact that they often have something that's a little bit less expensive if that's what you're looking for.

6,Michael R.,"Zillah, WA",56,54,19.0,4.0,2017-06-09,"I'm a fan of Red Robin! They've won me over entirely. As far as a burger chain goes, Red Robin, especially this location, has never disappointed me. Many burger places lack depth or a variety of flavor in their burgers, leaving a heavy dark flavor in the mouth. Red Robin, somehow, has managed to create a flavor profile that feels light, varied and interesting with each burger on the menu. The bottomless fries are excellent, and I recommend a couple of pots of campfire sauce to go with. This location in particular is pretty nice looking and the staff have always been friendlier than most restaurants, with a passion and interest in the job they're doing. When I'm in the mood of a burger, it is always this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

I told them I had been waiting for 20 min and they told me you have to call because they can't see the curbside parking spaces.  Um, just tried and they didn't answer. Plus there wasn't anything stating you needed to call to let them know you were here on the sign or in the email confirmation.  Ended up with cold food that wasn't any better than a fast food burger place that charges half the price.  And no apologies for the confusion or cold food.

1,TJ B.,"Richland, MO",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-14,"Very upset with the way the female night manager handled a minor argument between my gf and i. I went outside to smoke a cigarette, and she called the police for domestic violence, which was a lie for one, and for two, she lied to them about what had taken place, acting like it was an emergency and someone had been assaulted, which was 100% not the case. Anyway, cops came, no one got arrested, because no crime was commited. And needless to say due to domestic violence laws in washington state the police put a unwanted order of protection between my girlfriend and I. So neither of us wanted it put on! So she essentially ruined my relationship by making a call to the police in which she lied about what was going on! Which is why im posting this. That's not the whole story but it's most of it. I hope some people see this and decide to go to Bobs Burgers Instead! The food is much better there anyways, and they are much more accommodating and catering, instead of rude, judgemental liars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-yakima,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
