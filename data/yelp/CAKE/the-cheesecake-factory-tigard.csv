Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",669,562,1974,3.0,8/25/2015,"FOOD: Good. It's the kind of food you'd expect from a chain restaurant but better. I do believe that they're menu is far overwhelming, but I kind of believe that what makes this place so great when you have a group that can't decide what they want. We ordered an appetizer, a kid's meal, and my fiancé and I split an entree. We started with the crab bites, which was a small plate, and it really is just a little food. They come out with six, little balls and dipping sauce. It seems more like a personal appetizer, but it was good nonetheless. The kid's meal was grilled chicken and vegetables, and it was pretty good and looked pretty good for a kid's meal. My fiancé and I split the adult version of chicken strips, and it came with mashed potatoes and corn succotash, which was all good, too. I would've given this place four stars, but I had to take off one for: SERVICE: Meh. Our server had absolutely no personality whatsoever. The service was blah. The bare minimum a server would have to do to get a tip. No smile. Monotone. Least amount of words a server could say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60
Brenden R.,"Salem, OR",0,2,,5.0,4/15/2017,"My fiancé and I came in on a Friday night for a special occasion. Wait was about 40 minutes. We got sat in what I thought was the bar but it was little 2 top tables/booth things. The gentlemen helping us was great. Drinks were never empty and appetizers came out fast. Avocado egg rolls were amazing! After our apps were delivered we were ready to put our order in. The server was patient with us and never did we fill rushed.  I got the cheesesteak with sweet potato fries and It was great. My fiancée got the The chicken Alfredo, it was really good too! We only ate half to save some room for dessert, again the server was extremely patient and gave us plenty of time to make our choices.  There was a busser working this shift. Holy smokes. Watching him clean a table and set it up was a show in it self. It's cool to see and experience people passionate about their jobs.  This was an awesome first experience, I'm excited to try this place again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60
JoDee M.,"Raymond, ME",31,24,15,2.0,9/1/2016,"The service is fine, but for the price the food is rather meh. It tastes like over priced food aimed for my mom's pallet and the names are such that you don't realize you are walking into bland city.   The beets were cute huge and tasted like more sugar and less vinegar than I typically desire.  12 dollars for crappy salmon rolled into an egg roll served with mai Thai sauce out of the bottle?

Rose E.,"Portland, OR",448,462,2334,2.0,8/4/2015,"They weren't very busy on this day, and for a party of two, the wait at 6pm was very short, only a few minutes. But once seated we seemed to be forgotten.  There were two of us, and also parties of two on either side of us. Even though we were seated and ordered first, they both received each course long before we did. We had the same server as one side and a different server than the other side.  I'm not sure what would have caused the delay, it was just strange sitting there so long after two sets of customers came and went while we were still waiting for our food. The food was very good though, as always. Service was friendly too. I'd forgotten that they box up the leftovers for you, they don't just bring you the box. The box and bag both leaked horribly though, even though I was VERY careful to keep it perfectly level. So the leftovers had to go straight to the trash. Had I boxed them up myself, I'd have left out the sauces, especially the one I clearly hadn't touched (why would I want to take that one home if I didn't care to eat any of it there?) Still, it's a nice once-in-a-while treat. I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I'll forget all about this experience before I go again next year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60
Jessica B.,"Hillsboro, OR",136,133,118,3.0,11/23/2015,"The spicy chicken chipotle pasta (hold the chicken) has gone downhill in flavor over the years. I also asked for no peas, but the dish came out with peas. One time I got the vegetarian ""burger"" and the taste would cause a meat eater to think vegetarian food is gross. From what I remember, the appetizers were good the times I did get them. However, the price of an appetizer is the same as an entrée that I would get elsewhere at a decent restaurant. The cheesecakes are always a bit too sweet for my liking. The item I love most is the complimentary bread! Regardless of food quality and taste, the service is always excellent. I admire these people for the work they do in this hectic environment. The ambiance is alright if you don't mind crowds of people. The fact is, CF will always get good business even with a low Yelp! rating. People love this kind of stuff. I don't intend on coming back here anytime soon. The price you pay is just not worth the food you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60
Holly V.,"Seattle, WA",73,67,483,4.0,1/9/2017,"I love coming to Cheesecake Factory it's really pretty inside. Went on Sunday so it wasn't busy at all and got seated right away. The menu is huge!!! There's so many food to choose from. Our server was super friendly and our food came out at a good time, didn't have to wait too long for our food. The portion was really big but worth the price we paid. The food we got was really good and tasty and flavor just perfectly. Was super full after lunch but we still had room to share a piece of cheesecake. It's a must to eat a piece of cheesecake when coming here since their know for that.

N B.,"Vancouver, WA",3,35,136,2.0,3/27/2017,"Went here soon to close, this is what we got  Thai lettuce wraps-- so good, order it, it's worth it.  Crab and artichoke dip-- it honestly tasted fishy, not crabby, didn't find any lumps of crab it was mostly artichoke, and I would never order this again.  Chicken taquitos -- again another miss. Verde didn't taste like verde, the Pico was old, you can tell right away when the tomatoes don't have any integrity, mushy, and also if you look at the skin of the tomato it ends up turning white. If you go, just get the Thai lettuce wraps. And then you feel bad for saying the crab and artichoke dip and taquitos are not Good. Maybe it was just an off day.....  Great, happy service, but the food did fall short. Super short.... (Besides the Thai lettuce wraps)  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60
Ken F.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,5,,1.0,7/30/2017,"The food was poor at best. My wife's order of Marsala chicken was tasteless and incorrect- it came with potatoes and she asked for pasta.  They forgot our appetizer and, once seated -we waited more than 30 minutes just to order. I ordered chicken and biscuits.  The chicken was over cooked and dry.  The chicken was pounded so thin ( 2-4 mm thick) it barely resembled meat.! The gravy was tasteless and was slight more viscous than water.  The only other Cheesecake Factory that I have eaten at was in Honolulu and I enjoyed it.  I would never return to this particular location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60

Bread was stale. I had to ask for cream and sugar for the coffee. Food was slow to come out and when I asked the response was because we ordered too much food all at once. We ordered a sandwich and 4 appetizers.  It was not a good impression for our visiting guest so we left without ordering full meals.

Service: main reason for less stars.  It was not busy, but yet they made us wait 10 minutes to be seated.  Then seated us right by the kitchen with what sounded like a dish throwing war going on!  We asked to be moved then they put us right in the center completely in the open.  Lol.  It felt like I was eating on stage.  Food: It was decent.  Portions were small for the price and ratio of food was not right.  Flavor was there though.

Jeanette Z.,"Beaverton, OR",79,8,5,5.0,7/23/2017,"We ate here late. So our waiter was on it. I wish I could say something bad about it, because 5 stars is a lot I know for a chain restaurant. First time eating at a CF, they didn't have where I'm from. The salad, the roasted mashed potatoes and filet was perfect! Just like I ordered. The filet was literally so tender I could have cut with a fork. Too full for cheesecake. Our waiter was so nice. He asked us if we wanted to take home a couple pieces for all of us to share that they could not sell because they got a little mushed on the corner. My niece and nephew loved it when we got home. I was surprised how good everything was. I mean I'd heard good things but their steak and cheesecake are terrific! There are so many good sounding things to try on the menu that it would take  forever! All the different items would take forever to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60
Jane V.,"Newberg, OR",43,197,362,3.0,12/8/2015,"Before we walked in we saw customers with the digital callers waiting for a table. Not a good sign. Walked through the restaurant door and 30 plus customers sitting, standing, and waiting to get signed up for a table. We headed straight to the bar hoping for a shorter wait.  The bar area is quite large with many tables and a long bar that must seat 20. Everything was full  except two chairs on the end of the bar. It was being cleaned off and we did not see anyone waiting. Lucky us. We snatched it up.  The bartender greeted us right away and asked if we are having cocktails and/or food. We took our time to order food since the menu is quite extensive. It was very difficult to read the menu due to the very dim lighting. We really like the atmosphere. The lighting made it quite intimate  even though the restaurant was packed. I guess this is when one can use their phone for additional lighting in reading the menu. I know my dad would not have been able to read it even with glasses. We ordered the bar size Asian salad and the Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries. My daughter and I share everything. Even with the smaller salad we could not finish it all. We thought the salad had a good combination of chicken and vegetables with some mandarin oranges and dressing. The Cuban sandwich  was on a baguette with a assortment of meats and a few pickles. Very simple, very filling, very large. The sandwich was brought to us with a side salad not the sweet potato fries as we ordered. I was surprised that the server took the salad of the plate in exchange for the fries. Not that we would have room to eat it anyway but most places just leave it and also bring the correct item. We waited for a good 10 minute for the fries. Got charged for them too. 10 minutes was a long time. We did not have dessert which I am sure going to The Cheesecake Factory and not having cheesecake is a crime. Maybe next time if we have a lighter lunch. I blame it on the bread and butter they offer after we ordered drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60

Michael B.,"Portland, OR",212,109,13,2.0,3/26/2016,"This is a difficult review because I don't necessarily like chain restaurants and the automated nature of them. So here is as unbiased review I can write.  1. I've been here twice and there's an ungodly wait for lunch. Why people would wait 45 minutes to eat at a chain attached to.a mall I don't know.  2. Service was very good and no complaints or issues. 3. The food is decent for a chain restaurant. I had a sandwich which was good but nothing special. GF had a salad which looked good. Tried several apps which were good. Overall, maybe a notch above an Applebee's food. 4. Prices seem decent but not great.

Everyone for some reason wanted you so badly they were waiting in line for HOURS. A friend decided to have her birthday at you and were willing to start the wait (even with reservations) for an hour. We arrived after they had been waiting, no joke, for an hour and a half and then we waited, again...no joke, another hour. We waited forever for ok food, crap service and an insane bill at the end.  I swore I would not go back...until I did...reluctantly. No line...really tasty food and a crazy long menu full of tasty looking suggestions. Ok, warming up... I went back with my husband once and had another wonderful meal. After everything though the other night I met Mike. After working 14 hours I was exhausted and hungry and wanted something non-takeout like. So I called and met Mike who was beyond helpful and friendly. You know how most places you call for takeout make you regret calling. I was in shock as to how easy it was. Then I went to pick it up and Mike brought it to my car with a smile.

Chelsea S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",28,74,23,4.0,1/10/2016,"There's not too much to be said in a Cheesecake Factory review, to be honest. The decor, the overwhelming business and sound, the twenty+ page menu, it's all very...dependable.  I'd been to this location in the past and the food wasn't all that great - it was very clearly frozen. They seemed to have improved, though, as my visit tonight was very enjoyable!  My guy and I, on a date night using a gift card we received for Christmas, had the avocado eggrolls, a veggie burger with fries, and the falafel salad. All VERY good. I would highly recommend the cucumber lemonade!  Our waitress was friendly and efficient, keeping us moving through the dining experience quickly but not rudely. We were lucky enough to be seated in a dark corner for our date-night, which really added to the enjoyment. Social anxiety + those awkward tables that are too close together along a long booth DO NOT MIX.  I typically only make the trek to the only Cheesecake Factory in Oregon when it's on someone else's dime, so I'll definitely be back...next time I receive a gift card!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=120

The food was simply bad. I got fish and chips a simple meal should be relatively edible everywhere. Not here. It was over cooked I'm pretty sure it wasn't seasoned.

Shannon H.,"Portland, OR",381,154,174,3.0,9/10/2015,"You should kinda know what to expect since this is a big ol' chain. It's ""pretty,"" it's overpriced, the food is fine but nothing I'd go out of my way for, and they have really delicious cheesecake.  My daughter likes this place so I find myself overpaying at this establishment from time to time. The staff can vary not just by day, but by who happens to be delivering something to your table. I've had really great service and I've had incredibly bad service. It is what it is and I go here knowing what to expect, the bar isn't set high.  What I learned in my last visit is that they tend to always try to seat you in the lounge area unless you state a preference. This is a bad idea for you as a diner. The lounge is busy, it's loud, the tables are tiny, you're so close to your neighbor you might as well just share food, and almost every time I've had a bad service experience it's been in the lounge. So heed my advice, just sit in the dining room where you don't feel like a sardine in the middle of the stock exchange (seriously, where do all these food runners come from?? Where do they store them in the back?). I'm bumping them from 2-stars to 3 only because the cheesecake is so good and they have so many kinds.

However one was a major mess up so my son had to wait another 30 minutes for his food and it still came out gross. I had the Monte Cristo which for some reason came with no egg on it, first kid ordered chicken and waffles (adult menu) with no hollandaise. First came out with it second came out with the eggs soaking in water on top of the waffle. Second person ordered a cheeseburger it came out literally bun, cheese and a burger. Not one condiment. My mom ordered the chicken avocado sandwich , came out with no avocado. Extreme fail!! Have been to multiple locations but this one definitely needs new cooks. To top it off we got not only a full bill but they charged me for the kids drink that came with my daughters meal.

From seating to paying, our dining experience at lunch took 2 hours. The food here is not the best in the world, but it was convenient and we figured we could have a bite before hitting the road after our mall trip.

If she eats gluten, dairy or a small list of ""FODA"" forbidden foods she will be sick for SIX WEEKS. Yes, imagine your child crying and in pain for six weeks for one bite of the wrong stuff -- this is our life.  My wife took our daughter out for a special mother-daughter shopping night at the mall, and they decided to try to eat at Cheesecake Factory,  My wife came home praising her experience!  Two managers, Daniel and Cathy (sp?), sat in the booth discussing the menu and my daughter's allergies, to insure she would get a safe meal.  The chef apparently did their best to use separate equipment etc.  The waitress was extremely understanding and communicative.  My wife could not be more impressed. We used to love this place just for their happy hour and the experience my wife and I would have on our own, now we're just amazed at how supportive and caring the restaurant staff is. P.S. my food and service has always been good here -- obviously you're not getting fine dining, but very good food and prices and selection.

They assured us this would not be a problem, took our name and number ans said they would be ready.  We showed up as planned the next day and went to the front counter and told them we were there to pick up our order. They scrambled around for about 15 minutes before finally telling us they were out of the key lime cheesecake size we ordered. How can a cheesecake factory be out of cheese cake, especially when it is ordered ahead. They offered to give us half a full sized cheese cake for the same price (it was supposedly more cake than the smaller one we ordered). Fortunately, it wasn't for a special event (it was for father's day, but my dad loved it in ANY form).  I was just disappointed the way they handled the situation (the staff were nice enough).  Not sure how to avoid this problem in the future.  For as much as it costs to go to Cheesecake Factory to eat, or even get cheesecake, you would think it would be more organized in how it is run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=120

Mei W.,"Clackamas, OR",101,60,1048,1.0,3/26/2016,"My daughter requested a cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. So my husband called in an hour before to reserve a strawberry cheesecake. Most of us are lactose intolerant and therefore requested a 6 inch cake. Lucas confirmed over the phone they had it set aside for us.  I went in to pick up the cheesecake. I had to wait in line and when it was my turn, Lucas knew exactly who I was and told me the 6 inch strawberry cheesecake was no longer available. There were a few 6 inch plain and one strawberry in the front case. I asked if I can get one of those. He told me they are not for sale, although I saw someone pull some from the front case. I asked him what is the smallest cake he had and he told me a 10 inch one for double the price. Since it was my daughter's birthday and she specifically asked for it, I went ahead and bought it. Lucas told me they were ready made. I was very surprised to see him go in the back area and put strawberries on a plain cheesecake, then charge the higher price.  I had to wait over half an hour for Lucas to make the strawberry cheesecake. He did not apologize for the wait or say thank you. Will never go back nor recommend this place to anyone.  After reading a few other reviews, it is highly recommended to never pre-order a cheesecake here.

She hooked us up pretty well, was very welcoming and happily smiling and full of excitement. We came in for lunch, to celebrate my cousin's birthday. I was feeling a bit down/tired when we got in, but she lightened up the mood with her smiles and happy comments. When we placed our orders and the complimentary bread came in, I expressed my joy for the wheat bread of course, and she noticed it, and got us two more orders of he complimentary bread before came out. Now for the food, I had the southern grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The mashes avocado was so much goodness :), oh and the sweet potato fries, heaven; really well cooked and salted. I also got a strawberry smoothie which was really good and refreshing too. Come time for desserts, we mentioned it was my cousin's birthday and she was like oh nice, they do have complimentary sundaes for people celebrating their birthdays and that they would sing too. And so more servers from the restaurant came in and we all sang cheerfully for him. Such a great experience. We also got some order of cheesecake slices to, and she made sure to pick out the biggest slice for me :). Of course I got the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. It's usually my favorite.

The place was packed, which is always a good sign, and the menu was abundant, so I ordered a steak and asked what the ""veg"" was that came with it...the waiter said, ""I believe it's either green beans or asparagus, do you have a preference?"" Why, yes, kind sir...I hate asparagus just a tad less than green beans, so let's go with that. The steak was ""meh."" I've actually had a better one at Denny's, and the mashed potatoes were VERY peppery, but still quite good. The asparagus was cooked in a way that doesn't disguise the fact it is asparagus, so that stayed on the plate. Cheesecake was fine, but not as good at Costco's cheesecake (you know what I'm talking about, people...Costco's is orgasmic).  Now, time for the bill. They up-charged me $1.50 for the asparagus.

I have had it in Indiana as well and it was extremely good there. The last two times I've had it here at this particular location, was put together very quickly, hardly had any of the ingredients on it that was supposed to come with it. The dressing that they put on the side was very sparse. After I expressly told the server when I ordered it that I would like the dressing on the salad, as this was a kale Salad which is a lot better when the salad dressing is massaged into it.

Mina A.,"Portland, OR",0,3,,3.0,8/30/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite restaurants between me, my sister, and my mom. The three of us would travel down from Portland OR to Washington Square just to eat at Cheesecake Factory. However the downfall to this is that me and my family tend to visit during their busy hours ( past 7-8 pm on weekends ) which usually have us waiting between 40 minutes or an hour just to get our table for 3 people. Depending if the mall is close or not, my family just buys time by shopping around the mall till the buzzer, buzzes us up. Service quality is quite nice but sometimes we would get a server who's not really on task. A man once forgot to give us our bread till our main course came out but he was giving other people their breads and helping them but did not bother to check on us and when we asked him to, to-go our cheesecakes he said he already told the front desk to have them in their boxes, but then they ended up bringing the cheesecakes in their plates and not in boxes.  But besides that one server who wasn't so great towards me and my family, the others who served us were great and nice. The restaurant serves many different type of food from salad, salmon, pastas, and sandwiches. Their cheesecakes, of course, are greatly made and taste very delicious!

Jenny S.,"Portland, OR",63,70,9,1.0,1/19/2016,"Loved the place until I found out their Cheesecakes aren't vegetarian and neither is their mac and cheese. I've been at least 4 times and ordered the same thing, the macaroni and cheese burger sub a veggie patty. The server said that she could do that, but that the macaroni and cheese balls contain meat broth as well as the cheese sauce that they put on it, so I may not want to eat it if I was a vegetarian. I am a vegetarian and I was incredibly upset that I hadn't been told the previous 4 times I had ordered this same meal. If you add meat to something that is generally meat-free, it should be noted on the menu and your staff should make it known to people who are specifically ordering their meals to be vegetarian. My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer while I looked for something else, but I wasn't really in the mood to eat there after that. I started looking at the desserts so we could get something to go. Our waitress noticed and informed me that the cheesecakes are made with animal based gelatin, which is completely unnecessary. Not only is there plant-based gelatin, but as a baker, I have made cheesecakes that didn't require gelatin and were the same rich consistency. TL;DR - Staff should make people aware of meat that is in dishes that are typically vegetarian, especially if the customer is altering the meal to replace meat with a veggie patty.

Yvett R.,"Portland, OR",267,473,170,3.0,1/2/2015,"We had visited another Cheesecake Factory location a few years ago really just because of the hype. It had just opened in our former city and everyone was still in love. We left unimpressed and not in any sort of hurry to visit another location again.  Fast forward a few years and now my husband won a gift card from work. We'd had it for a while and found ourselves with some unexpected free time, no dinner plans, and near this place. So, pretty much the perfect storm for dining here.  Oddly enough the wait wasn't that long. We were quoted 15 minutes, but didn't wait that long. Our server was lovely and nice. I just can not get over those menus, you know. I'm a fan of a one page menu and these give me some sort of anxiety. I even dissect the organization of sections. The novel-like menu turns me off like you wouldn't even believe. I seriously lose my appetite.  The food was ""eh"". It was really good, it wasn't the worst. It just tasted like any other chain that doesn't really stand out. I couldn't even remember what I had until I really thought about it. I had some sort of burger, my daughter had some type of pasta and I can't remember what my son and husband had. The kids had to have one of the cheesecake slices after the meal. I only had a little taste but found it to be too sweet.  Cheesecake Factory never leaves me feeling like I can't wait to come back. With so many other dining options available, I suppose the only way I'd go back is with another gift card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=140

Serena R.,"Lincoln City, OR",0,5,,5.0,2/4/2017,"Kudos to the team for handling a very challenging customer this evening!  This restaurant was busy and quite full on a Saturday evening. I chose to wait for a spot at the bar which ended up being a thirty minute wait. No problem for me, perfect time to do some people watching while my husband shopped in the mall I witnessed a lady get very disgruntled over the fact that some low tables in the bar area opened up and she was told she was not able to sit there. The staff member informed her super politely that these tables were part of the restaurant seating (which there was an hour wait for at this point) not bar seating. In her defense it isn't super obvious that this is the case while waiting for a spot at the bar. However my personal tactic would be to say okay and continue to wait for what is the bar section to open up. Not this lady! She proceeded to stop most every member of wait staff who walked by and engage other patrons in her frustration. Someone (I'm assuming a manager)came over and with wonderfully disarming body language and polite words she somewhat settled the lady. Fast forward another five minutes to getting a seat at the bar (where I got the distinct honor of sitting next to this gem). She was still berating the employees for the seating policy and all three of the people behind the bar were so respectful to her. She had some challenging requests like a not very sweet MaiTaiand she didn't like the lighting. I watched a waiter bring her a candle. Mostly the point of this ridiculously long post is to say well done staff! You all showed a lot of kindness and genuine care to someone who wasn't so easy to handle.

Andrea H.,"Beaverton, OR",60,175,28,2.0,1/5/2017,"After living right by this location for almost two years, we finally dined inside the actual restaurant. We've gotten takeout several times and it's always a nightmare. No matter what time of day you go, there are lines spilling to the door, the wait is long, and just trying to pay and pick up your food can easily take 20 minutes.  Nonetheless, we felt adventurous and thought perhaps going on a Monday at 5PM might help our chances. Nope. We walked in and stood in line for about 5 minutes to put our names down - 40 minute wait for a table for 4. We didn't feel like going anywhere else so we stuck with it. My parents went shopping and my husband and I somehow found a spot at the bar. Super friendly and attentive bartenders, and the happy hour menu was enticing just because of the value, but we figured we would wait to have food until being seated. We were seated after about 45 minutes, and were given a nice booth.  Our server was fine, nothing special. We ordered our food and it came out fairly quickly. Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered. However, my mom ordered the Chicken and Avocado salad, and it came with no avocado. The restaurant was so dark that I used the flashlight on my phone to get lighting so we could see if we were just crazy. No avocado in a salad that has avocado in the title? We thought maybe it was just at the bottom, but no, there was none. Simple mistake. However, when we told our server he looked at us like we were from another planet. He assured us there was avocado in the salad and left. My mom took several bites and there certainly was no avocado in her salad. We got him back over and he looked at us as if we were trying to pull something on him, so he just said he would bring her a side dish of a sliced up avocado. It was a weird exchange. I also had to remind him to bring me my side of fries, twice. I usually order the chicken salad sandwich because it's just that good, but this time it was bland and missing something. It seemed a bit dry and tasteless so i was disappointed.  Overall, it was a lackluster experience. I don't expect much from chains, but everything just seemed a bit disorganized and as if they didn't really care about their guests. Oh well.

Our daughter received extremely hot food from the kids menu and ours was tepid. Waiting for the manager and the check took another 30 minutes without a drink refill.

Jess Y.,"Portland, OR",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Usually my family likes to come here for dinner, but this time we decided to order a whole cheesecake for my dad's birthday. It was our first time ordering a cake from here and it certainly will be the last.  I ordered a 10"" Tiramisu cheesecake with a chocolate plaque TWO DAYS before the pick up day. Went in at 8pm like I said I would and waited for 30 minute to find out they had no cheesecake ready for me, only the chocolate plaque. The lady at the front apologized but did not give me a reason why the cake wasn't ready when I asked. I was already late and short on time, so I ended up buying the 7"" cake since she told me they had one ready. I also told her I needed one ready-to-serve. Opened it up at the party to find it frozen. This is the first time I've been so upset with the service.

Jerry M.,"Portland, OR",8,495,1325,5.0,5/14/2015,"I know the Cheesecake Factory is usually really busy at dinner time which can mean a long wait.  So, we went early (just a few minutes after 5 o'clock) and were seated immediately, getting dinner off to a good start.  Service was friendly and efficient.  We asked if they had a ""happy hour"" and our server explained that was available only at the bar, and she was willing to relocate us there if we wanted.  We decided to just stay in the dining area and order from the regular menu.  Well, their menu is huge with lots of things to choose from.  She brought us a couple of tasty baguettes to munch on while we were deciding.  One was a sweet dark bread, and the other was a crusty sourdough.  Good stuff.  I ordered Chicken Madeira for my entree.  It consisted of two chicken breasts pounded flat and coated with egg, then sauteed. This was covered with melted mozzarella cheese and Madeira sauce with mushrooms.  It also included asparagus spears and skin-on mashed potatoes.  It was totally excellent, and the portions were good sized.  My friend ordered Garlic Noodles.  It had asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes, and grated Parmesan in the garlic sauce with the noodles.  The noodles were cooked just right, with the proper firmness.  She really liked it. . .and finished off every bit of it.  Even though we were at the Cheesecake Factory, I'm not too fond of cheesecake, but I do love chocolate.  So, for dessert, I had a slice of Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake.  It has alternating layers of chocolate fudge cake and chocolate mousse.  I liked that it was moist and ""pliable"", not dense and hard like some chocolate desserts tend to be.  There were three big blobs of whipped cream to dip each bite into as well.  It was BIG too. . .not some little bitty slice like at some other places.  OK, I think the Cheesecake Factory has all the good qualities I look for:  good food, generous portions, fair prices, friendly and efficient service, and it's a nice looking place too.  It's really obvious to me why it's such a popular and busy place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=220

Good service, remarkably quiet, tasty if unimaginative food (I had a club sandwich and fries, both of which were done well, seasoned and prepared to my specifications). We ordered a series of decadent and delicious cheesecakes to share, all chocolatey and all were consumed to the very last crumb.

Michael X.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,148,4,1.0,10/11/2013,"I only leave one star reviews for dishonest businesses or absolutely horrible experiences - this one is for the latter. I've been to this Cheesecake factory location a few times, and have been underwhelmed each time.  But my visit last night takes the cake, no pun intended.   Before I get to last night, I've been to quite a number of Cheesecake factory locations and this one by far is the worst I've been to.  For starters, they seem to have somehow packed in way more seats than they should have - you're literally bumping elbows with the people sitting next to you.  Not pleasant.  Next, in my opinion, the food at this location is not as good as the other CF's I've visited.  So last night, I happen to be close to this location and for some reason decide to stop here for a meal.  I go up to the reception area, told that it's a 10-15 minute wait, say that's fine, handed a pager, and I have a seat and wait.  Pager goes off, ushered over to my table (which is about the right size for an elf) yet the table hasn't even been cleaned yet.  So I patiently wait until it's cleaned and sit down.  No menu, so as soon as my server comes over, I kindly ask for a menu.  She then has the audacity to ask me where I came from and did I come from up-front - clearly implying by her words and tone that I had somehow cut in front of everyone else waiting and just plopped down at this table. I'm thinking really? did this person really just ask me that question? Given the elbow to elbow seating, I waited for the people sitting next to me to leave before I spoke to my server - as I didn't want to embarrass her in front of those people.  Yeah, I had a little more respect for her then she had for me. So the people next to me leave, and I tell her how inappropriate it was to tell a customer that, clearly implying they're some dishonest schmuck who can't wait in a line.  She goes on to say something along the lines of ""well we have a problem with that"" - people just sitting down apparently.  And how that's my problem, I've yet to understand.  Total lack of accountability and I think my telling her this sailed right over her head.  If this location has a problem with people sitting down at tables, perhaps they should look into fixing their seating issues, but treating customers like criminals is totally inexcusable.  Needless to say I won't be going back to this establishment again.  Even despite this unfortunate event, this particular Cheesecake factory isn't worth waiting in line 30 seconds for.   PS: The manager, at least it seemed to be the manager, was going from table to table like some Disneyland automaton asking each person the exact same canned question if they were enjoying their ""experience"" or something along those lines - with as much genuine interest as some Washington DC politician.  He didn't even seem to pause long enough to hear someone's answer :) Priceless.

Since we had two trips to Washington Square Mall-and it was the daughter and SIL who are doing the low/no carb diet, we decided that CF would give them the most options.

It just rolled out here in Oregon this past week and my theory as to why my staple (miso salmon) was off both times I ordered it is simply because the new menu (with 40+) items is just a tad overwhelming for the kitchen to learn and the rest of the staff to execute.  The management here is great-offering to fix just about anything, giving us gift cards to return (Tuesday's gift card was used Thursday), wanting to give us dessert either to eat there or to go, etc. We declined the dessert but the attempt to ""make it right"" would make both Tim Gunn and Gorden Ramsey happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=220

April G.,"Seattle, WA",23,143,19,3.0,7/8/2013,"I know it's silly...but I normally LOVE the Cheesecake factory.  The Menu is literally 25 pages long, it has something for everyone, it is tasteful, it is good quick food, and it is healthy.   So when I was in town for a race, it felt like a safe choice to choose here to eat to carbo load for my race.   We asked to be seated outside in the shade, we were seated at a table in the full sun and the hostess told us we could move the umbrellas however we wanted.  To make matters worse, the lady at the table next to us had a loose dog!  How is that allowed? So we have the dog running around, we have the sun in our eyes, but the waiter came quick and we thought okay we're hungry!  But this should have been a sign! I was happy that I could get my standard race meal, Penne Pasta, Grilled Chicken, and Marinara, almost exact, I just had to order it without the basil butter and oil.  The waiter confirmed my order, I was happy.  The order came out wrong.  First, I hate sending food back; ever since the movies ""waiting"" and ""still waiting"" came out it scares me enough to eat out and then to send it back?!?  Well it had to go, and so I sat, and my food came, and this time it came out right. (?)  Secondly, the waiter that was waiting on us we had to ask him to speak up 4 times.....I'm not hard of hearing and it wasn't loud; we were sitting on the patio.  It just felt like he was doing it to be annoying. It wasn't the best experience I've had at the Cheesecake Factory, maybe it was the location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=260

Kenny P.,"Portland, OR",94,148,,3.0,10/10/2012,"I have been there multiple times and this will be my first review of it. The service It is a pretty packed restaurant with a decent service. The servers are usually pretty nice and they will assist you and ask you to wait politely. The good thing is they give you thing that can vibrate (not vibrator) when your table is ready. So, while waiting (usually always packed) you can go for window shopping at the mall. Once you are sit on your table, they are pretty nice and fast to take your order The food I have tried different kind of foods here. Nothing really stand out. The cheesecake was good. Any kind of cheesecake will not disappoint you. Pay attention, i said Good not exceptional. Nachos was pretty basic. The portion was huge but the taste was ""ummm"". Firecrackers salmon for appetizer is recommended. It was actually pretty good. For main dish, the most memorable one is cajun jambalaya pasta. The other pasta was pretty plain. But this one is pretty flavorful. The Atmosphere It was nice place to hang out with friend. I recommend to call in for reservation if you come in big group. It will be pretty noisy but you can join in the crowd and be noisy as well. If it's summer time, sitting outside might be a good idea The location Located in Washington Square mall, so parking is super easy. They have big parking lot. And of course, it's easy to find Will I come back?

Karen M.,"Beaverton, OR",26,11,,2.0,7/8/2013,"I don't understand the appeal of Cheesecake Factory. This location is always jam-packed, so the wait for a table is frequently ridiculously long. The menu is the restaurant equivalent of War And Peace in length. I mean, it has advertisements for other businesses, like a magazine. Once you finally make a decision on your meal, the portions come and are massive. I mean MASSIVE, to the point of complete gluttony. The food itself is just ok. With all of the amazing choices available in the Portland area that are fresh, local, independent, reasonably priced, and delicious, TCF is on the bottom of my list of choices for eating out.  On the positive: the service is very good. The few times I've been there. The servers have been prompt, attentive, knowledgable of the massive menu, and courteous. This is a typical American corporate restaurant - feed the people massive amounts of food and then encourage them to eat MORE by offering a gigantic piece of cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=240

After trying a lot (though no where near their entire menu), my staple go-to's are the chicken sandwich, Romano's crusted chicken with pasta, chicken madiera, and any of the pizzettes.  They taste good, the price doesn't mean quality though, it means quantity! I know everyone goes for the cheesecake but seriously try the truffle layer cake--delicious!

The shrimp scampi was over cooked and under garlic ed.  The steak was great. The side of horseradish was super bland. The complementary bread tastes good but they don't cut it through so you have to tear it. And smash it. But it tasted good.  The chocolate mousse cheesecake was awesome. The reason for the 3 stars is the waiter took so long between visits, except while we were starting to eat he came by 5 times asking if it was good.  Anoying when you have a mouthful.

Kevin F.,"Reno, NV",1,16,,3.0,8/3/2015,"Around the time this location first opened almost 10 years ago, I had my first date with my now wife. This restaurant has always had a special place in our hearts. As time has passed, the euphoria of that experience has worn off, and we are able to see the cheesecake factory for what it is; a fairly good chain restaurant with a menu clearly designed to satisfy the masses. The food, atmosphere, and service are good but not great. Nothing about the experience is exemplary or unique, but sometimes a good lunch that is certain to not disappoint is exactly what we want. The wait times vary from 15 minutes to an hour, and the food can be pricey. The restaurant is very popular so they obviously do enough right to make anyone happy.

I had the SkinnyLicious™ Shrimp Summer Rolls that were Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shitake Mushrooms, Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp - Served Chilled and an order of the  Ahi Carpaccio Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto which was pretty interesting to say the least. Not quite what I was expecting.  The salad rolls came on these little puffy rice noodly things that, I'm sure were Ok to eat but they were messy- almost like long rice crispies. I think this  place is complete fluff. In other words is great for the ambiance and area, but way over sold and the value isn't good here you are getting way less than what you're paying for. That tuna stuff I had? It was 12 bucks.. you could go broke off the appetizer menu alone.

Janessa L.,"Spokane, WA",4,75,4,1.0,2/25/2013,"I'm from Spokane and whenever my husband and I are in places with CCFs, we go. We like the food that much. We were staying in Vancouver, but made the 45 minute drive (from our hotel) down to Tigard. When we got there they were out of pagers which should have been a sign, but we put our names in and were told to check back in 45 minutes (saying the wait was an hour). We did some window shopping and returned, only to be told the wait was another 40 minutes--but that the current wait was 2 hours, as if that were some consolation. We waited...and waited...and waited. 40 minutes came and went, husband checked on our status, was told another 5-10 minutes with only 5 other couples in front of us. 20 minutes after that, I sent him in to cancel our table, and it was finally ready. The table they took us to, in the bar, should not exist. It was up against a wall and less than 12"" from the couple next to us. Husband could barely get into his seat. His ass was basically in their dinner as he squeezed by. Awesome. We are not large people by any means. We wouldn't have been able to move our arms to eat, let alone converse, in the terrible configuration they stuck us in. We finally cut our losses (that would be 2 hours of our lives we'll never get back), and bailed.  We've gone to many very busy CCFs before, and have never had to wait more than about an hour, maybe 1:15 once. Clearly, this one has issues with slow service and/or food. We chose to leave hungry rather than endure any more torture to find out. Update 5/30: I contacted the restaurant directly after writing this review, expressing my concerns. I got a call from the manager saying he'd send me a gift card so I could try them again. 3 months later and I'm not holding my breath on him ever following through.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=240

When we entered the parking lot of the mall, she saw Cheesecake Factory & said, ""Let's eat there, I got a $200 gift card!"" Of course we aren't going pass up on free lunch, so yes let's do it. The wait was about 15 minutes, not too bad at all considering at home it's about 30 minute - 45 minute way (sometimes an hour) but they did open a second location in Kapolei. Anyways, getting off topic... Our server was little all over the place & actually his behind bumped into my mom's shoulder a couple of times while he was talking to the table next to us (& he didn't apologize about it either). He would walk past our table, then it would kind of click in him that he forgot what we asked for.  Their fresh bread is super good, which my stomach definitely appreciated.

Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. It was soooooo good.

At any rate, this one seemed a little sub-par. The wait was ridiculous. I get it if there aren't any tables, that's not what I mean. What I mean is, after our one hour wait for a table, we waited more than 40 minutes to get a server to acknowledge that we were there, and another 40 minutes before our food came out. TWO people ordered food that they were ""out"" of. I've always thought that Cheesecake Factory's menu was ridiculous and couldn't imagine what it takes to be able to offer basically EVERYTHING on their menu. It's not a problem in other locations, but what are the odds that TWO items aren't available because of a missing ingredient? INCONCEIVABLE! Or poorly planned/managed.

Came here to just grab a few beers and ended up getting some food towards the end. All-in-all, our waitress was really nice and responsive, checked-up on us the right amount and was prompt with getting us service. The place is nice on the inside and has a bit of an oceanic feel to it with the decor and lights.  I got a chipotle chicken sandwich, which was HUGE. It was only $13, but I swear it was an entire chicken breast, so I'm glad I got the salad on the side. The sandwich (it had a burger bun) was actually really good; the chicken was super juicy and the chipotle sauce gave some nice kick with the breading, and the vegetables (tomato, lettuce) were fresh. Other than the sheer size of it (which can be good or bad depending on how hungry you are), which made it a bit hard to eat, it was enjoyable.  The salad was a bit disappointing. I ordered blue cheese and when it arrived it looked soggy like it had dressing on it, but there was practically nothing on it. Seemed like they put a drop of salad dressing on it then mixed it up. Odd. I asked for some more and they gave me extra dressing so it wasn't a big deal but it was a bit confusing if they actually thought it had dressing on it.

However today was kind of a disappointment.. I usually order a range of dishes depending on my mood. Today I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and I think last time I had it was back in L.A. so it's been a good 5 years. It was saucy, chicken was nice and crispy, and the pasta was delicious. With that nostalgia and craving pasta, I decided to order it once more! However, the pasta was too dry this time, chicken was kind of on the softer side (not crispy) and I probably should have had it taken back and ordered something else but I was so starving I just dived in and by then, it was too late to return it. On the bright side, some dishes I highly recommend are: fried calamari, firecracker salmon, pasta da vinci, bistro shrimp pasta, crispy chicken costoletta (one of my favs), hibachi steak, and ribeye steak.

In the lounge if you find a spot you're lucky, but that doesn't include the middle tables and back booth tables so it's most just the bar stools and a couple side tables. They don't take reservations. But it's worth the wait. The menu is huge, many pages long. The waiters have always been nice. The drinks and food are well done.

This is a place to experience with others, or be a fan of doggie bags.   Almost everything is better than average.  Today our party of 13 enjoyed a plethora of dishes.  Standouts: spaghetti and meatballs (simple, but effective), Avocado Toast, Huevos Rancheros (wish they offer refried rather than black beans), calamari, carrot cake, one of the cheesecakes (only 50 to choose so just guess), and fish tacos.   Average: cheese burger, fries, bread basket, Mac n Cheese, shrimp pasta and crab dip.  The Sangria was good, but very ice heavy.  Server did a great job, especially as we had seven kids in tow.  Food arrived fast.  It's a chain, it's in a mall, but the old formula still works.

Copious selections of appetizers, entrees, drinks and desserts leave me dizzy!  These factory workers must love and never tire of their jobs. Nothing resembles a cookie-cutter assembly line here.  As far as restaurant chains go, this one takes the cake.  The cheesecake. The robust Chicken BBQ Ranch salad rolls off the conveyor belt loaded with romaine lettuce, avocado, grilled corn and chicken, black beans, cucumber; tossed with moderately spicy ranch dressing then topped with soft yet crunchy deep fried zucchini rings. It is worth its weight in cogs and gears.  The dessert shift ramps into high gear and must be on double-time.   Our entrees find us too full with no room for dessert. At the Cheesecake Factory; a dessert emporium no less, the notion of walking away with no dessert is pretty much an oxymoron.  Countless choices fill the display cases. As we mull over the cheesecake appendix to the menu, I envision thousands of cheesecakes stacking up on the the factory conveyor belt. We MUST stop the bedlam and choose a slice to go or cheesecake carnage will ensue.  So many choices!  We select a piece of cheesecake so thick and filled with gobs of milk chocolate, gooey caramel, crunchy peanut butter; topped with about five silos of rich, dense whipped cream, why a dedicated dessert conveyer belt alone must deliver this decadent dessert to our table.

Water refills were on point. Food was pretty delicious, if you pick the right dish (I had chicken bellagio- chicken was a dry for my taste). Presentation was on point though, however the dim lights makes it hard to Instagram. I dislike the long wait. A party of 7 had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes before seated. Someone did keep coming to update us regarding the wait, however the way they said it sounds like they ONLY HAD ONE table that can accommodate our large party (they had to wait until that party to leave....)  The Cheesecake factory is a pretty big restaurant and you're telling me that you only have one table big enough for our party? dangggg, if it wasn't for a birthday gathering, I'd have left years go.

There was an incredible amount of choices on the menu. From appetizers, to food, specialities, drinks, and dessert. It was so hard to decide. I had the bacon bacon burger and it was pretty tasty, it's huge by the way! The appetizer we had was a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon strips and it was cut into four squares. The description of it, for some reason made us think it was going to be mozzarella sticks.. and it was not. (Our bad) but they were average, not something we'd order again, very plain. I had a alcohol blended drink, it was all peach and it was SO good! Now the drawbacks, the restaurant is very dark, and VERY loud. And by loud I mean the music was just blaring. Our waiter was very nice, but he came by our table at least 30 times asking how everything was interrupting our conversation and it got to be annoying. We were fine, enjoying our food, eating, drinking and having conversation. We felt like he was sort of trying to rush us out of there.

We had to use candles taken from the bar to be able to see the menu. and (B) the music is a bit too loud. It was too dang noisy for us ""over the hill"" types. A lower volume would be nice. On the plus side, the iced tea was good and the fried catfish was cooked just right (well done), and the Fish Tacos (tempura battered) were very good as well.

Sure the cheesecakes are decent, some are even great, but overall I find the cheesecakes from my local bakery to be much better. Many of the cheesecakes at the Factory are waaaaay toooo sweet!! Total sweetness overload!  The food is...meh. I mean, it's not horrible by any means, and it is better than a million other joints, but the prices are steep, portions WAAAAAY toooo big, and the food is nothing to rave about. I would rather pay a smaller fee and get a much smaller portion and would likely dine here more if there was more selection in the smaller portion sizes. Put all that together and factor in the long wait to get a table on most days and times, and then factor in that you have a server who is mega busy waiting on table and likely to be less attentive than servers at less crowded establishments and it just doesn't make much sense to me why this place is so popular. One kudo I have to give the local Factory though is good management. Managers do show their faces and address problems. That is a big deal in my book!

Heather E.,"Chico, CA",2,97,,4.0,1/15/2013,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a weekday afternoon.  I wanted to go ""before the rush"" so I walked around the mall for a bit and then was seated around 5.   I was seated at a smaller table for two and promptly greeted by my server.  He brought water and asked if I had any questions about the menu. The menu is fantastic because there are so many different things to order, but at the same time, it takes forever to look at everything.  They serve breakfast all day, there's appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, simple dishes, fancier and more expensive dishes, a whole menu of ""skinnylicious"" items which are designed to be low-calorie, two full pages of desserts and on and on.  After taking probably 15 minutes to look over everything, I decided on a veggie burger and salad. My server brought two small loaves of bread (one wheat, one white) with really good real butter, and dinner came out shortly.  My veggie burger was AMAZING.  When you order veggie burgers at restaurants, most of the time they are handmade.  Some places use veggies and grains, others use black beans, every place kinda does their own thing.  Cheesecake Factory makes theirs with black beans, brown rice, farro grain, beets and onions.  It was so flavorful and unique and just simply amazing.   I also wanted to try some cheesecake because they're famous for it, so I decided on the original plain flavor.  I was actually really disappointed with my cheesecake selection.  The cheesecake is made with a lot of sour cream, and it definitely has that tangy flavor to it.  Also, it was really soft in the middle, almost running off my fork.  Maybe I'm just used to eating a more firm cheesecake, but regardless, I wasn't a big fan.  However, I don't think it would deter me from eating there or trying another dessert.  It could have just been a fluke. Overall, I'd say a great experience with good service and solidly good food.  Just, make sure you come early because this place gets really full really fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=280

Not food poisoning sick, just sick from all the many many very bad quality ingredients that they use in their food. First of all, we started the meal with a margarita and a mai tai. The margarita was more like a waterita and the mai tai was one of the scariest cocktails I have ever tasted in my life. It tasted exactly like the syrup that maraschino cherries sit inside of. I could not drink it at all. Next, we asked the waiter for some glasses of water. Instead of bringing us both water, he only brings water for one person. One of the next times he came around I asked him to please bring another water. Instead of bringing another water, he quickly grabbed the 1 cup of water that was already there and refilled it and came back. Wow. Next, we had some guacamole which was actually not that bad aside from the salsa that accompanied it which was basically just diced tomatoes out of a can. After that, I ordered a margherita pizza. The pizza was one of the scariest parts of all. It was literally just pizza crust with a smear of sauce and some tiny scattered slices of mozzarella. All the places that did not have mozzarella we're literally just crust. Also, I just remembered I forgot to mention the chicken samosas. This was also one of the scariest parts of the meal by far. Usually samosas are made with a delicious combination of curried vegetables. The outside of the samosas were exactly like egg rolls and the inside was just ground chicken, that's it.  I instantly felt sick.

To be honest, I only wanted to eat here because I have heard the name so many times on the Big Bang Theory tv show. But I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the food! I got a pasta dish that was on the little specials list. Great price of $14 with yummy spaghetti noodles, mushrooms, meatballs, pepperoni, etc. It was delicious! Half of it filled me up. The menu is gigantic, I kind of want to go here to just try everything.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, it's mood lighting (but not too dark) inside with beautiful decorations. We got sat after two minutes on a Wednesday at 6pm, but it was at the tables where you're sitting pretty close to other people. A little loud inside and definitely funny when the people next to you can hear everything you talk about!  Our server (if I can remember, I think his name was Charlie), was very nice! Checked in on us, refilled drinks, and happily asked if we wanted more bread. It was great!

For the price, portions are generous. They also offer many seasonal items as well.  Everything I've eaten here so far has been good. And, of course, the cheesecakes are the big reason why people come here.  The big drawback for me is the wait time to be seated.

It's so loud that the first time I brought a friend in, we walked in and out in under a minute. We couldn't tolerate the sheer volume. Perhaps, some soft sound dampening panels or curtains could be added? The only time it's not crazy loud is rare because the restaurant isn't full... which doesn't happen frequently.

Jennifer Y.,"Mililani, HI",117,109,291,5.0,11/11/2016,"THE LOCATION Perfectly situated at the ginormous Washington Square Mall, this restaurant is located in the Northwest corner of one of the top grossing malls per square footage in the US. It makes for a excellent pit stop to refuel and recharge before tackling the remaining acreage of the stores.  THE PARKING Endless and ample free lot parking surrounding the entire shopping center.  THE ATMOSPHERE The last time my husband and I visited a Cheesecake Factory was many many years ago. It was the one in Waikiki where it's always crowded, dimly lit and so noisy that you can't even hear yourself think. This location in Tigard was a pleasant surprise. As soon as you enter the restaurant, there's enough space in there to ballroom dance. The charming decor, elegant lighting, soothing color tones, exaggerated high ceilings and well-spaced tables make for a comfortable yet grand feel.  THE FOOD Even though it's typical Cheesecake Factory fare, it's consistent and done really well.  ---Teriyaki Chicken $16.95--- Sure it's not the best teriyaki chicken, but it's a good healthy alternative though it contains way too much sodium for someone on a low sodium diet. As usual, the portion size is generous. However, my husband didn't have any trouble polishing off the chicken and mashed potatoes plus 1/4 of my salad. He left the accompanying sautéed plantains untouched. I ate the sautéed pineapple chunks which came with his dish.  ---Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad, dinner size $14.95--- I love salads and this one certainly satisfies without high calorie ingredients like bleu cheese and bacon. It contained a generous mix of romaine lettuce, mixed greens, cubed avocado, a sprinkling of cashew nuts and some sliced chicken breast. The honey peanut dressing was requested on the side which was flavorful but turned out to be slightly too sweet for my taste.   THE SERVICE  Extremely professional, courteous, attentive and prompt.  THE BOTTOMLINE We would definitely return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=20

We obliged and the three of us sat at the bar. We ordered our drinks and bread as well as our entrees. One person with us was 17 but NO one told us she could not sit at the bar to eat as there were lots of kids already in the bar itself. The bartender asked her how old she was AFTER we had all ordered and of course she said she was 17. We were told she would have to stand behind us to eat as she could not ""sit"" at the bar itself. We were not directed to a free table which would have been appropriate since we had already ordered everything. We were told to go back to the front desk after we had already ordered. We saw an empty table on our way out and thought we could perhaps sit there since we had already ordered. ""NO"" was the answer due to the table being a wait list table. This was the WORST customer service we have EVER experienced! Unbelievable that we had ordered everything and were not given a table that was on the WAIT list since we HAD ordered already. ALSO, someone should have said prior to ordering that someone who was 17 would have to stand up at the bar rather than sitting down to eat. GOOD GRIEF. I would NEVER go here again, EVER!

Elizabeth L.,"Clackamas, OR",38,71,194,4.0,12/7/2013,"We tried The Cheesecake Factor for the first time this evening.  We arrived at dinner rush so I expected there to be a wait but not a 90 minute wait. Oh well not a huge deal as it is attached to the mall so we walked around while we waited for time to pass. When we were seated they brought our two year old a complimentary plate with bananas and bread on it. I wish more placed did this! Our waiter then came took our drink order, he returned right away with water and a coke but forgot my strawberry lemon-aid and then disappeared for 10 minutes still not bringing it when he came back.  He did eventually bring it but it took much longer than it ever should have even with them being busy.  We ordered tomato-basil pizza, shrimp scampi (served with angle hair pasta), and a side of french fries to share.  The portion of the fries was huge! Three to four people could definitely split this and not feel like they got cheated out of fries.  The kitchen messed up the pizza and they brought out a tomato-basil flat breas by mistake and just comped us that. This was good, the bread was thin and crisp the edges were not burnt nor were any of the toppings. It was light but better as a shared appetizer than a meal. The shrimp scampi was not 100% what I was expecting but it was good. The shrimp was large and was breaded and sautéed, no sauce on it. The pasta had a light garlic cream sauce which was very tasty but more sauce was definitely needed. Finally the pizza was brought out. I had them take it back and boxes up to take home so I cannot comment on it. Lastly we decided to order a dessert. We chose the Linda (?) cake it was very chocolaty and very rich between the two of us we did not finish half of it, but it was so good.

Meredith K.,"Portland, OR",14,15,1,2.0,1/2/2015,"We went here because we had a gift card from Christmas (we got a PetSmart card too, despite being anti-PetSmart, so go figure). It was a long day at work so we figured we would use the card and have a nice 15,000 calorie dinner (this is not an exaggeration). We get there around 5:40 on a Friday and it's packed. The place is fairly large and has twice as many tables than would be comfortable and there's still a huge line. We get the pager and learn it's an hour wait. Cue wandering around the mall... We ordered the buffalo blasts as an appetizer. I have no idea what we expected. It's basically a chicken and cheese pot sticker that you dip in buffalo sauce. On my first bite I immediately noted that the aftertaste is similar to the taste you get when you throw up in your mouth. I wish I was kidding.  I got the spicy cashew chicken as an entree which was entirely underwhelming. It was much more sweet and didn't even hint at being spicy. I'm a big spice fan so I expect a lack of heat, but come on. At least make an attempt! The rice was plain brown rice, not even jasmine. Womp womp. My boyfriend got the fish tacos which mostly like tasted like the lime he out on them. I had a piece of fish (tilapia, I believe) and could only taste the lime-- pretty strange concept. Of course, tilapia is always a mild taste but a disappointing choice for tacos.  We figured things couldn't get worse so we decided to shoot for the 1,000,000 calorie mark with the Reese's cheesecake. Definitely the best part of the meal, but that bar wasn't too high.  We had the leftovers boxed up and realized once we got to the car that we forgot them.

The waitress was nice enough to get us new ones with even less than what we got before. The chicken was not worth the extra $3 we paid for. We all ordered cheesecake too. They were delicious (as always) except they said they were out of meringue for the topping on the lemon meringue, but didn't want to replace it.  This was a mother's outing for us, but my mother had the worst experience. She went to go to the bathroom and the stalls were all out of toilet seat covers. Because they were out of toilet seat covers you could see into the other stall! My mother came back surprised that there would not be solid panels in between each bathroom stall. When the waitress came back around she had the manager called over and when she explained the situation he just looked and said I'm sorry and walked away like it was no problem. We all had to go to the restroom while we waited for the check so four of us girls went so we could go in pairs so that we did not have anyone peeking through the hole in the panel at us. We went and all saw the hole for ourselves. There were still no toilet seat covers in either stall (this was 20 minutes after we had complained to the manager). So we once again informed the manager and a female employee that there was no toilet seat covers and that there was a hole in the wall. We insisted that the manager fix Tue problem and we would wait for him to finish before we went to the bathroom. He rolled his eyes and sighed at us, before going to fix the problem. This is a problem that needs to be fixed immediately with patching up the panel somehow. The manager was rude and didn't seem to care about any of our problems.

Laura D.,"Portland, OR",0,43,,1.0,5/5/2015,"Their food has gone downhill significantly over the last few years.  It used to be that when you went you'd get lush, soft warm bread to start the meal, followed by huge portions of decadent well seasoned food.  Now, you get hard lumps of partially burnt bread, followed by bland, dry, overcooked and under-seasoned food.  I emailed to follow up with the company after our most recent meal, and was informed that they did not have new staff nor had they changed the recipe for their whole wheat bread (which is the type we ate).  There was no excuse for why two out of three loaves of bread we received were burnt.  Nor for why all three of the loaves were super hard crusted with barely any softness to the inside (despite being freshly out of the oven). Nor for the dry, overcooked and under seasoned steak and shrimp.  Nor for the absurdly stale ""children's plate"" they brought when we arrived (with brown sliced bananas and hard little stubs of bread that looked like turds).   They offered to send us a gift card to try the place again (I suppose under the presumption that the staff simply had an off day), but it was for such a small amount it would be impossible for my family to try again without spending some of our own money.  And quite frankly, there are so many wonderful restaurants out there that I wouldn't risk spending money on another terrible meal here, even if half of it was paid for by somebody else... If you need to go someplace around the mall, try Red Lobster instead (just as expensive, but the food is well seasoned and not grossly overcooked).  If you're just looking for good food in general and location isn't as important, check out all the other wonderful places Yelp has to offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=180

It was just too insanely busy though and it was rather disappointing to know that they were severely unorganized at the hostess stand.  Some people waiting near us had been told that they were out of pagers and to return in an hour to see where they were in line.  They came back in an hour and were told their name had already been called -- then after some insistence were told it would be only another 10 minutes and 30 minutes later they were called -- NOT OKAY -  Once seated, however, service was outstanding!  I love the food and drinks here.  I even took an extra entree home for lunch for the next couple of days.  Just be prepared for quite a wait...  LOVE this place -- definitely get the bread basket -- you can get it at lunch if you want just ask... dinner they should serve it automatically.  Also try the ranch they make it and it is  FANTASTIC! Cheesecake -- well I am not a sweet lover -- but you can't go wrong with their cheesecake -- really any of them -- I am on a mango key lime kick -- but others have served me well over the years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=100
R C.,"Lake Oswego, OR",0,6,1,1.0,10/10/2016,"I feel bad for the wait staff having to serve the sub par food at this establishment. This was my second time to this location this year resulting in the same opinion of the food. Although my 1st visit did not receive a review, this one does.  My food came out warm(ish) and acceptable however my guest was not as lucky. Her tacos were ice cold and the (semi-soft) tortillas were cold and brittle. Sending the order back resulted in a 15 minute wait and an awkward eating arrangement as I had a plate and she did not. The replacement order of chicken tacos were slightly better and appeared fresher. However the portions of chicken in each was poultry. (Pun intended). If these are predetermined portions, someone needs a raise because they are saving The C.F. a ton in food costs. The meal was terrible! The manager on duty stopped by to offer his apologies and acknowledged that the replacement order was taking an inordinate amount of time as did our embarrassed server.  OK, here's the kicker.....$65.00 meal, cold food, measly portions and one returned entree. Not one item was comp'd, not a slice of cheesecake, glass of wine, beer.....nothing! I don't enjoy complaining or sending an item back and certainly don't make a habit of it but when I do I expect some form of compensation for the ineptitude of the kitchen staff. There are too many excellent places to eat in this town to have to suffer this places poor form again. The Cheesecake Factory should be ashamed of requiring their servers to present food like that! I doubt that I will return and hope that readers of this review choose other quality places around there like Nordstrom Cafe, Thirsty Lion or even Orange Julius for that matter.

My husband is disabled and in a wheelchair. She kept glaring at our table. I ask the waiter who she was and why is she staring. We felt very uncomfortable. He told us that we weren't the first people to complain. She walked behind my husband while he was adjusting his wheelchair and under her breath she said ""watch it"".   We left and while in the car I called the corporate office.

We drooled over the Cheesecake display case while we waited. Menu is HUGE. There is something for everyone,  including my vegan husband. We order and about 30 minutes pass and I notice other tables getting their food before us. No biggie, we were all having fun in our conversations. Our server came over and apologized for the wait for our food, he accidentally forgot to put in my order correctly. Manager came by about 5 minutes later and once again apologized.  My husbands food comes out, as well as both my daughters. 5 minutes go by, still no food for me. Manager comes out with my food finally and she has the look of fear in her eyes. She apologies again profusely and tells me that my meal, along with my husbands app would be taken off my bill. I tell her that wasn't necessary but she insisted. She thanked me for not yelling at her like most people would. Why the 5 star rating?  Accidents happen. Food gets dropped, an order put in wrong, a ticket getting lost...

Jemma M.,"Portland, OR",170,2,,1.0,4/19/2017,"I came here with my fiancé and my family on a Sunday afternoon. I started recently coming here more often, but this time was the last. We went in, was sat after a 20 min wait (which isn't horrible it usually is way longer) and was then greeted by our server. He came by and got our drink order, and then later delivered the drinks when he came to grab our food order. When he brought the drinks, he forgot half the drinks. Then after he grabbed our food order, he came over and brought bread and such. This is where EVERYTHING went downhill, and this is NOT the first time I've experienced this. After the food arrived, he forgot the cream and refills we asked for a while back. Then he came back by to tell my fiancé he forgot to put his order in, and that it would be out soon. While we are waiting for his food, the server neglects to tell us it will take a long time, and drops of some kind of soup to compensate for his late food I guess? We look at what kind of soup it is because the server never asked if he even wanted soup, nether the less what kind. It ends up being clam chowder, which my fiancé is allergic to shellfish. Wow. Okay so 15 minutes later the food shows up, with the tomato he asked to have not be on the sandwich. And after all this, NO MANAGER CAME BY AND THE FOOD WAS NOT COMPED.

Kitty N.,"Portland, OR",15,29,34,3.0,2/15/2012,"The epitome of American gluttony. There is nothing on the menu that an average person could actually consume all of. Not even all of the leftovers.

The food is fresh, nicely presented, and tastes pretty high quality...you know, real meats, cheeses, fresh baked bread, fresh veggies, and the like The staff is friendly and always quick to greet us, take our order, and keep our drinks full. They also have a huge bar with an expansive specialty drink menu. A girl-drink drunk's fantasy!  I don't ever choose to come here on my own, I always get talked into it by family or friends, and I always kind of regret it. I feel awkward in their huge building (very Vegas feeling), and I hate not being able to order a 'normal' portion of anything. I always end up paying $15+ to eat, even lunch, and waste 3/4 of the food. I like to share, but rarely end up there with people who want to share because everyone always wants something different and they always seem to think they can eat all of what they order.

Since it was the end of the work week, I thought I would get something exotic at the bar. The Mai Tai was a delight. Fun to look at and tasty. By the time we were seated we were hungry. The service was efficient but rushed. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to drink when the waiter came. He took the my husband and son's order and left while I was looking at the menu. When he came back with my husband and son's the drinks and we placed our order, he did try to bring my drink to me quickly but the place was slammed and he was hustling. When I got my order my first bite was disappointing. My habachi steak was cold as was my plate, meat and vegetables. I had the waiter bring me hot potatoes because I could manage to eat the other food cold, and I really didn't want to wait to have the whole meal recooked or have the medium rare steak come back well done. My husband enjoyed his steak and salmon. No complaints. My son's pasta dish was miniscule. My husband and I laughed when we saw it, although our son didn't find it funny. Poor guy wasn't even close to full after eating so of course, he had to order a dessert. The Cheesecake Factory does live up to its name. He enjoyed the cake. Still, considering the atmosphere, the price, the cold food/small portion and the fact that the Portland metro has so many really great places to eat, we won't be going back any time soon.

Ariel M.,"Leawood, KS",23,66,13,4.0,3/11/2014,"Had the combo shrimp scampi and steak medallions for $19. So first off the meal itself did not fill me up but the mashed potatoes that came with it did. They weren't anything special but after eating a bit of it I just couldn't eat anymore. The steak and the shrimp however were amazing. The steak I had medium rare and it was amazing, great seasoning, perfectly balanced, and properly cooked. Then the sauce just pushed it over the edge and made it divine, I wish I had more of it. Then the scampi was also pretty amazing. The sauce it came with however was a little too overpowering, but when lightly applied to the shrimp it provided a good balance of flavor, I also wish I had more shrimp to eat, but between the two the steak would be the definite winner. If you want just the steak it was called Diane's steak. I also don't feel like they gave enough food for the money I paid but company meal, so I can't complain too much. Ambience was good, service was good, only down side was the last persons dish didn't come out till about 15 minutes later. They did end up giving the meal for free though along with a free soup or salad, would have been nice if they gave a free cheesecake slice though. Otherwise it was a great experience.

Jeff H.,"Salem, OR",91,270,9,2.0,1/24/2012,"I debated two or three stars, and even though I didn't actively hate The Cheesecake Factory, I was just underwhelmed for what I got. It's a chain, but it's a high end chain.  The decor is over the top, but I can't help but feel like it's just trying too hard...like everything else here. The menu is huge and has a wide variety of styles and options.  Mexican, American, Italian, Asian, everything is represented.  I chose the orange chicken and my friend got a chicken salad.  We also had an order of fried cheese as an appetizer. Well, the fried cheese was actually kind of cold.  Cold like....out of a freezer and heated up and not quite gone all the way to hot.  Either that or it was sitting out for a while for somebody else, who didn't want it or forgot it, and we got it, because it came out almost immediately.  Eh.  It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't that great. Just like my orange chicken.  Not horrible, just...nothing special.  In fact, Panda Express does it equally well (if you get it right out of the fryer, at least). The complimentary bread to start with was very good though. A sour note was the diet coke I drank.  It came from the bar and presumably came from the cocktail gun...and was very watery and thin.  I guess it's mostly for mixed drinks, but still, it just wasn't that great.   And I like my diet coke, gosh darnit. All that for about fifty bucks.  It tried really hard...but it just wasn't that great.  I guess the emphasis is really on deserts, but since we were going to the Moonstruck Cafe later that night, we didn't want any of that. I don't see any particular reason to go back, but I wouldn't turn it down if someone else wanted to go there really bad.  It just would not be my first, second, or even third choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=300

First, if you are going to have your staff dress in white, make sure it is a crisp clean white. The crew as a whole, other than the hostess was kind of dingy and frumpy.  Never once, other than tableside, did I see the staff smiling. The two female bartenders looked like they were moments away from shooting themselves in the face. Rarely have I encountered such a dour group of people in one spot. No one looked happy to be there, even though it is a beautiful restaurant  and one would imagine, a nice place to work. What should have been a fun experience, was just kind of depressing. If you are in upper management of Cheesecake Factory and you are reading this, take a look at the faces of the people working here. They are not happy. On to the better part of my experience, beer and food. I had the Salad Rolls and the Artichoke hearts and a nice cold IPA by Ninkasi. Salad rolls weren't the most beautifully crafted, but they tasted fresh and the accompanying peanut sauce was good as well. The Artichoke hearts were my favorite part of my visit.

I really enjoyed the ""buffalo blasts"" for my appetizer. Chicken and cheese stuffed inside some delicious breading and deep-fried, with spicy buffalo sauce and/or blue cheese dressing to dip them in. The sauce was flavorful and not overwhelming, although I can always handle (and enjoy) the heat. Delicious. For the entree, I was served crusted chicken romano, with pasta underneath in a light red sauce. Very filling and no hint of being microwaved. Then....the cheesecake. Oh, the cheesecake. A slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake was the perfect ending to the meal.  The only downer was my seat. Usually when I go to a restaurant, a booth is my preferred place to sit. We were instead put at a table, one side with a chair, the other with the cushioned booth. You know what I'm talking about. I took the chair. Oops. Mistake of the day.

A man craves a beer in a mall. In Tigard. Panic? Shame spiral? AA? In a fit of all three I found myself in the CF right as happy hour ended, so the bar was packed with check payers. Not a seat in the house. After a few minutes the whole place cleared out and I grabbed a seat while the bussers and servers and barman tidied up the remaining service gear. I even got a, ""thank you for your patience, sir,"" from the busser as he ragged off the bar surface. I received a prompt, cold delicious beer selected from the bar menu that has no prices on it, which is but a minor annoyance. Ahh, sweet relief. Check the old iPhone and...oh yeah. Then the smell of old bar rag and vinegar starts to waft around and I know that rag has been in use since the Nixon administration. This happens. I get it, but things are going down. The restaurant is filling up and the bar has a few customers now, but our barman seems to have it under control. Then: abject horror.

Martini glasses are being rimmed with blue sugar. The remaining bar seats are filling up. my beer is getting empty.

The selection is *huge*, if a little spendy, and in spite of a lot of their stuff being something I can't eat right now (I will be so glad when I can have dairy again, even with pills!), I was able to find plenty of good options. Because of the selection - if I had it to do again I'd review the menu online before going. Oops! I didn't like having to have the stroller away from our table and just set the carry-basket on the bench, but they were polite and helpful about it and I must agree that the available space they have would *not* work with the stroller parked at the table, not in the least. (I prefer not to set the basket on any raised surface, but it really was well-settled on the bench with the table helping keep it in place. And obviously the floor was a worse option.) The decor is beautiful, and I was astonished we didn't have to wait to be seated, considering we walked in during the brunch rush the Sunday before Christmas. The food was tasty; even my (finicky) toddler liked his meal. The portions are utterly huge - I saw people with ""appetizer"" salads that would be a whole meal for me. I ordered from the light menu and was stuffed even so - I'd have taken half a regular meal home, maybe more. The staff were incredible. Very helpful, very on top of things, very friendly and polite - just excellent service. We were actually seated while the ""regular"" server for our area was on his lunch break, and when he came back on, he immediately circulated all his tables making sure a) we had what we needed and b) we knew what he looked like to flag him down if we needed him. (Basic courtesy, but basic courtesy that is not always seen!) Also, the waitress who helped us while he was on break made sure we knew which page the Sunday brunch was on. My husband was sad to be so full he couldn't even face the dessert menu. (I would be, but their specialty is so far off my diet right now, I would be sad just looking at it.)

It is so loud, it was difficult to relax or communicate without shouting. It is so dark, it is really hard to read the menu.  While we were having our pre-dinner bread, we noticed that my spoon had food crusted on it, as did one of the plates. When presented to the waiter, his attitude was uncaring and he seemed annoyed by our concern.  The menu, while expansive is very random and the food choices are not paired well. For example, several dishes included a starch but not a vegetable. When we asked if my salmon came with a vegetable, the waiter simply said ""no"" and did not even offer any suggestions. Spaghetti did not include a salad, and once again no input from the waiter other than ""no"". The waiter told us that the items on the ""regular"" menu came in gigantic portions. However, the only things that were large were the plates and cheap starches such as potatoes and noodles. The meat and veggies were very very small portions.  Food was OK, but obviously prepackaged and reheated. Service was average at best, but we were forced into paying a 18% gratuity.

I substituted the french fries (with filet mignon, really?!) for sauteed spinach. The menu is huge, and everything sounds delicious. I was upset to find they got rid of the bruschetta. I loved it.  :( But they bring you delicious sourdough baguettes with butter. Good enough. The filet mignon was amazing. Best steak I've had in years. No joke. I was surprised. Then we HAD to get cheesecake to go. I got the pineapple upside down cheesecake (for the love of food, get this!), he got the Oreo cheesecake. I'm not a fan, but it's popular.

It's a bit dark, cold, and loud inside and some of the food can be a bit greasy. But overall food quality is very very good and fresh, and the atmosphere is just splendid. The menu is freaking huge and the cheesecake selection is naturally impressive as expected. The portion sizes are also generous. They clean the shrimp so I don't have to eat shrimp veins and shrimp poo like some places expect me to. Nice. Outside seating, yey! Service is pretty much consistently very good. I feel at home here, this is my kinda place. One star removed due to not taking reservations, being louder and darker than I like, and not offering happy hour on weekends or later on weekdays. But then again the happy hour isn't anything special, it's just half off fried appetizers. No need to speed on over from work to make it before it's over, order better stuff from the yummy regular menu. Maybe someday they will offer tastier and healthier HH options. People like to put down the chains. I call them chain snobs LOL. But you know what!??! I LOVE chains. Yeah, that's right. Chains rule. That's why their all over, because they kick butt. Not all, but enough of them to justify their existence. Their usually consistent at least, whether you like what they offer consistently or not. P.S.

Our server was an absolute sweetheart. She doted on my 16 month old son, brought him out a plate of sliced bananas and thinly sliced bread to keep him occupied while we waited for our food.  The food was good. We ordered a few appetizers to share. The Vietnamese tacos were delicious. I thought I would like the avocado rolls more than I actually did. Don't order them unless you plan to eat them all on the same day. Having avocado in them, they obviously don't make good leftovers. We split the Farmhouse Cheeseburger.

I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory, was not overly excited to go, because I would generally rather try the local flair.  But I was with co-workers and majority rules, and for the most part, I am up for anything once.   We went on a Thursday evening, were quoted a 20 minute wait which was about 3 minutes.   I had the Ultimate Margarita that our fabulous waitress Nicole suggested.  I am glad I took her advice, this was well balanced, not too boozy, just a nice drink.  Sure, you pay for it, but I paid $8 for a lousy beer at an airport bar, so this is small potatoes. We had a couple apps, the ahi tuna and the artichoke dip.   I am not a big fan of tuna or artichoke, but I liked these, so they must have been OK. I bought into the hype and tried the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.   When the server set it down, I thought I made a horrible mistake.  I like spicy, but the first scent notes were FIRE IN THE HOLE!   But while I waited for the other entrees to be delivered, the aroma toned down, so I dove in.   Well done, but not the ""our #1 dish"" I was expecting.  Hype, ya know.    I tried the Steak Diane off another plate and it was the best bite of beef I have tasted in a long time.   Just lovely. We ordered cheesecake, I think there is a law that this is required.  Both the banana and the chocolate something something scrumptiousness were fantastic.  I suspect it is hard to get a bad dessert here.  What topped off the meal for me was our lovely server Nicole.  She quickly assessed that this was a table she could have a good laugh with and RAN with it.  We loved her!   She was quick witted, skilled at her craft and gave amazing service.    I would go back, certainly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=340

Anyway, we were seated and asked what we'd like to drink.  Our teas were brought along with bread/butter.  I wanted a nice casual meal and definitely didn't feel rushed at all on this particular visit.  Spazz got the hummus as an appetizer and I was surprised by the massive bowl of hummus delivered.  The bread was stacked beside the bowl.  I ate some of the hummus with the bread (not the pita bread).  Delicious.   We both ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (lunch-sized portions are $10.95 as opposed to the dinner-sized $13.95 portions).  I've ordered this dish nearly every time I've gone to Cheesecake Factory.  For some reason, this time was the absolute best I've had it.  It was FULL of pasta, sundried tomatoes, broccoli, eggplant, pine nuts, peppers, and kalamata olives.  I didn't feel like I ran out of anything before I was out of pasta, so it was perfect.   We mainly went here for lunch because we received a gift card for them.  In addition, we received 2 cards for free cheesecake.  Spazz is vegan, so it was up to me to pick a piece of cheesecake and bring it home.  I ended up getting one full of candy bar goodness and it's awesome!  I can't wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=360

I'd can only imagine how they kitchen staff can prep for a service. With the menu so scattered, a feel like the quality goes down. Second gripe: lighting. I feel like I had to strain to see the person in front of me.  It was also kind of jarring to transition between the mall lighting and the restaurant lighting.  Last gripe:  the wait. Nearly an hour.

The ambiance is nice, the service is nice, the seating options are nice (inside or outside- outside tables even have heaters!), and the wait is very moderate.  Only like 15 minutes and with the mall being right there, it was not a problem. I've had never really ""dined"" here in the sense that all I ever sat down and ate prior to Tuesday was the Cheesecake.  But on Tuesday, with Cheesecakes being half off and I having over $70 in gift cards, decided to sit down and experience the entire dinner.  And it was great.  The menu is huuuuge.  For the appetizer, I went with the fried avocado rolls, apparently one of their specialties, and it was awesome.  Very expensive, but truly something I'd never eaten before.  Tasted like a Chinese spring roll biting in but then immediately changed flavor to a more American taste.  For dinner, they have so many options that it's hard to decide what to get.  I was going to order from the Skinnylicious menu before I realized it's really the exact same thing as the normal menu except served in smaller portions, and hence cheaper.  So I ordered the normal veggie burger from the ""unhealthy menu"", probably having at least 800 calories, and it was delicious.  I also had some of the cheese pizza, which was excellent.   The desserts...  Before I even came, I knew was going to go with the cheesecake, but couldn't decide which one.  They are all extremely unhealthy, with some cakes having up to 1300-1500 calories in just one slice.  I didn't let that bother me and ultimately, I ordered the Godiva Cheesecake and split it.  It was a good thing I split it, because that thing was huge!  No one should be able to eat the entire thing after dinner and I'm not surprised it has that many calories.  For a four person family, you really only need two slices.  I also had some of the Tiramisu cheesecake, which was good, but nothing in comparison to the layered Godvida cake which was bursting with flavor.  I don't even remember what the layers were, but I remember it having a bottom brownie crust, a second layer consisting of cheesecake, actual Godiva chocolate in there somewhere, and topped with a bunch of whipped cream.   So yeah, excellent place.  And bill only came out to be $44 with tip for four people.  Pretty cheap considering we had no coupons.  Oh yeah, checked my weight the next day- not a single pound gained (hehe).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=360

I had the fried shrimp platter, which includes several nicely fried jumbo shrimp, fries and some cole slaw.  The shrimp were prepared exactly to my liking, they were crispy, fresh and tasty.  I didn't particularly care for the fries, but I really enjoyed the cole slaw.  Crisp, tangy and a nice way to clean your palate between bites of shrimp. Mrs. Brian I. had the vegetable salad, minus cheese, dressing on the side.  This is a giant freaking salad, and she was entirely happy with it.  The veggies were fresh and crisp. Semi-unrelated: I find CF's website hilarious.  You're ""greeted"" by this animated server that explains various aspects of the restaurant.  The way they've animated her is... acceptable, but her movements remind of the strippers in the original Duke Nukem game.  Kinda jerky, strangely robotic animation.  Hilarious. Back on topic: CF gets an extra star from me for 2 reasons.  First, they have Mac & Jack's African Amber on tap - one of my absolute favorites and seemingly a rarity around town.  Second, for our server, Jen.  I'm really picky about ordering shrimp.  If it's not cleaned/deveined then I have a real problem with it.  When I asked her if the shrimp on the platter were cleaned and deveined I wasn't expecting her to know.  However, she immediately responded ""Yes, they're cleaned, deveined, breaded and fried in-house"".  I was thoroughly impressed. I recognize why CF has averaged 3 stars over the course of it's reviews.  I think they deserve a 4th star because the place is simply ""working as intended"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=380

Bay Area, I entered this one with low expectations and a high degree of certainty that I would be in for a long wait for a table, mediocre service, average food and great desserts.  That way, I knew I would not be disappointed. While the wait WAS long (over an hour when we were told 30 minutes) we were a large party to accommodate and I was anticipating the wait.  But, the rest of my somewhat low and negative expectations were turned upside-down. Food was very good to excellent for all diners.  We had one entree that experienced a kitchen delay.  But the server quickly explained what the problem was along with a very sincere apology.  Because the portions are so large, two in our party eventually wound up sharing a VERY large entree and the ""problem entree"" was then canceled.  Absolutely no problem.  Even the manager came over to inquire, ensure everything was satisfactory and apologize for the kitchen's error, made sure we understood what had caused the problem and sincerely apologized AGAIN.  In our collective minds the problem was very minor but the wait-staff's treatment of it and of us was golden. The service:  absolutely excellent all around.  Water glasses constantly filled.  Ice tea refilled.  Bread refilled.  Very quick acknowledgement, a smile and an ""absolutely no problem"" attitude throughout the meal.  Personal, yet appropriate, conversation with the server.  This location could and should give customer service lessons and training to the S.F.

Alyssa V.,"Salem, OR",0,6,,5.0,2/23/2012,"My husband and I decided, on a whim, to go there last night (a Wednesday around 7:00 p.m.) for dinner. We have been meaning to go for a couple years, and decided to finally try it.  We were seated VERY quickly. As in, we checked in and less than 5 minutes later were being taken to our table. Our waiter (named Donovan) asked us how we were, to which we replied good and that we had never been there before. His first warning: the menu is very big. As in, 20 pages and then a couple for the cheesecakes and drinks. They also had a ""skinnylicious"" menu, which were all under 590 calories and smaller portions. He recommended a few things, let us know about their loaded baked potato soup, and then excused himself to get us some water. After bringing the waters and taking down our orders for strawberry lemonade (which was the best we had ever had), we looked over the menu. As our server passed by with cheesecakes, he would stop and briefly show them to use, tell us which one it is, and explain what was in it. We finally decided on the chicken madeira and the soup for me, and my husband had the spicy cashew chicken. The soup was great, and although I ordered the cup, it was the size of a bowl. Definitely glad I didn't get the bowl. They might have brought me a trough! When he brought us our entrees, I was shocked at the size of the plate. Two pieces of chicken the size of my head, and a hefty serving of mashed potatoes. I wasn't wild over the sauce, but it was still very good. It also came with steamed asparagus, which was done perfectly. The mashed potatoes (made with red potatoes) were well seasoned. I barely made a dent in my food. My husbands chicken was spicy, but not overly so. He asked for the brown rice, which complimented the chicken wonderfully. He actually ate half of his plate. Thanks to the cheesecakes our server had shown us, it wasn't hard to decide which ones to get. My husband got Adam's peanut butter cup cheesecake, and I ordered the Banana cream. We very light and creamy, and a fairly large slice topped with whip cream (mine also had freshly sliced bananas on it). I was shocked at our bill as I wasn't paying too close to the price (about $63), but very satisfied with the quality of food and service we got.

How cheesecake and Eqyptians came together, I have no idea.  Betcha it's an interesting story. After being ignored for a good 15 minutes; Our server came and helped us, finally. He apologized repeatedly for the suffering service, THANKS! Now take our DAMN FOOD ORDER. No, 10 more minutes of apologizing ... Yes, when you GET the service, it's great here =) Over-the top, actually ... Ordered a chicken and avocado club. It was good! I'm not a fan of foo-foo drinks, but foo-fooness runs rampant on their drink menu =) I tried the Georgia Peach; the cutest drink, with the weakest amount of alcohol - EVER. Did they forget to put it in there? Lots and LOTS on the menu =) I think it's a shame if you come here and stuff your face and don't leave room for dessert. I mean, this IS the Cheesecake Factory.

For drinks I recently tried the Tropical Martini very yummy, but pricey $10 for a glass. Pasta dish I recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta you'll love it I gaurantee. Appetizers the Thai Lettuce Wraps is messy to eat but a lot of fun and so good. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it's always busy all the time. That's when you know the food is good.

Liz T.,"Portland, OR",9,34,1,5.0,9/27/2007,"Thank you franchise gods for bringing The Cheesecake Factory to our world of small plates and foreign language menus! I first fell in love with The Cheesecake Factory at their original location in Beverly Hills, where the restaurant is more like an old house and seating is limited so I can see how some may be overwhelmed by the atmosphere and design of the large Washington Square location, but no matter which location  you're at, you will be served the same great food.  Yes the portions are large, but that's what to-go boxes and the gym are for. To me (a girl who likes to eat and get what she's paying for) large portions earn the restaurant a star, as long as the food is good, and it is! My favorite is the four cheese pasta, but I've taken everyone I know to the Cheesecake Factory and I've never heard a complaint about what was served, from the salads to the Cajun chicken littles to the appetizers.  Along with  your main course, they serve two kinds of super yummy bread and of course cheesecake. They always have about 30 flavors of cheesecake to choose from and they're all quite tasty. They range from great plain cheesecake with fresh fruit, to peanut butter-cookie dough cheesecake. Many are quite rich so I do vote share or get another to-go box. If you go on the weekend you will more than likely have to wait a while for your table, but it's worth it. They have a nice bar with yummy Bellini's (and other drinks) if you wanna grab a drink while you wait. Or you can venture into the mall and people watch.  Bottom line- You will not leave hungry, but you will leave wanting more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=420

Well, I am wrong. We came to have lunch at the Washington square mall location last Sunday. I ordered the louisiana chicken pasta. It was the worst I every had. It was very very greasy, and it had absolutely NO salt in it. I guess the chef was too busy such that he/she forgot to put salt to the dish. I tried it, and had my husband try it, and we both agree, it had NO salt. We added salt ourselves using the salt shaker on the table, but the salty flavor could not mix well into the pasta, and the pasta ended up tasting weird, kind of bitter. Because we have touched the food, I felt too bad to ask the server to replace the food. We took it home, but no one wanted to eat it. We ended up throwing it away.

The only drawback is that the portions sometimes are huge, but other then that I have nothing to complain about oh and since it's so popular it can get very loud. The cheesecake is delivcious.

We where seated quickly (but it was an odd hous 4:30ish), our waitress was amazing, she went over what the specials/soups of the day where before we had to ask and wasn't fake at all and was extremely plesant. As for the food, we where brought bread to munch on, a small white french loaf and a small brown bread loaf with oats on the top, and they also brought butter pats.The menu was huge and they have a vey nice bar with plenty to choose from, they also have a new skinylicious menu for the ones watching their weight. We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese (extremely fatty and caloric i know but as i said, we indulged ourselves tonight), and it was amazing. The noodles where well cooked and not soggy or dry from being fried, the sauce was very flavorfull, and the breading kept everything together well. They put a cream marinara on the bottom of the plate for dipping and my family and i agreed that it was perfect with the macaroni balls, (did i say they where formed in four golf ball-sized portions on the plate? no? well now i did.) My dad ordered the fetutini alfredo with a side of sauteed spinach and the spinach was cooked only with a little butter, salt, and pepper in a cast iron pan. my dad said the pasta was well cooked in the alfredo, the sauce wasn't too thick or to runny and he said it stuck well to the pasta. I had a chipotle crispy chicken sandwich on a kaiser roll. the only thing chipotle about it was a mayo sauce.I agreed with my mom's following notes on the fies but i liked them that way. Mom had a wild mushroom burger, she said it was tender she asked for rare and got blood rare ""the way she likes it"". she didn't like her french fries, had potential with seasoning, but where twice cooked which made them rubbery. After dinner my family and i decided to have desert which i extremely recommend, dad had the red velvet cheesecake, he says it was very good. (not very talkative tonight) Lol. Mom had the Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake she said the sauce topping was way too tart so she pushed it off to the side, commented that the whipped cream on the side was nice and tasty, also said the amount was just right. Both my parents had coffee's which had been freshly brewed, mom said it was above average coffee, i observed that it was quite hot, needed 3 sugars and plenty of cream, depending on who was drinking it. I had a cappucino which was, fair warning- huge, alot larger than your average cap. So i had the adams penut butter fudge ripple cheesecake, which was, O.M.G. Indulgent, it had Resse's on the top, caramel, cookie bottom, and choco swirls, with a topping swirl of penut butter icing. It was amazing. Beware and prepare for a sugar high!

WTF????? helllls no. i call the manager. he says, on let me check and see about that, that's not right. im standing in front of him waiting to hear whats up.. and he get's diverted. then a party of 10 gets called in and then a table of 8 get's called in.. more time pass and i'm like, for real can you tell me how long the wait is now because we're all here all waiting and it's been over an hour and a half. so he said, okay looks like the table we have you guys set up for has people still there, they have already paid and usually we estimate a big party to dine for about an hour to tops an hour and a half. it's now been an hour and 45 minutes and it's our policy that we can't ask them to leave. sooo i'm like damn if you guys can't ask, i sure as hell can. he standing there offering free appetizers and stuff.. im like damn. and just as i was going to walk over there, the party decides to leave. so he's like, a few minutes as we clean your table. great. they pretty much gave our table away and mixed up our ""reservations"" big bunch of jerks. manager was nice afterwards.. and our waitresses weren't terrible. food was good and the cheese cake was even better. i got the factory chopped salad and b had the meatloaf. both never fail and b had an extra slice to take to work in a meatloaf sandwich whoop whoop! friends had really good food too.. bbq salmon, mushroom burger, tomato basil shrimp angel hair. i know for sure the tomato basil shrimp pasta was good.. as for everything else, i didn't get to try it. everything was pretty spendy. i wasn't so happy about my drink. they DO NOT make a mean mojito. don't get it here. what else..? that's all for now. ill update if there's more. 3.5 stars for the food. 1 star for the customer service. ultimate FAIL in customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=440

The Cheesecake Factory is like Disneyland or Disney World; everyone wants to go but there are far better places to visit. Both my friend and I had never been and wanted to see what it was like. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, which was $11.95. Portions are huge and the prices are a bit high for a chain, but I've noticed prices are up everywhere in all restaurants, and so it goes... The sandwich was served with the sauce on the side, so I had to dip my sandwich in the sauce, which made eating it awkward. It was good, but I wish I went for something lighter. Warm bread is provided before the meal. If you order a drink, it's served in huge glasses and water is served in plastic beer mugs. Maybe it was me, but the food seemed rather salty because I actually asked for a Coke (I typically don't drink Coke or any soda at meals) because I needed something sweet to balance out the saltiness of the meal.  It's VERY noisy, so don't expect a romantic evening without the kids unless you like it noisy.

Why 3 stars then, instead of 1 or 2?  Well, for one, as I've mentioned, the service is quick once you're seated.  Two, I love love love their strawberry shortcake with its juicy, sweet strawberries and heaping scoop of ice cream.  && three, I liked that their mojitos come with a ton of mint leaves! Aside from these few perks, however, the Cheesecake Factory should not be a go-to restaurant for your foodings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=400
Samantha G.,"Portland, OR",27,32,,5.0,9/14/2011,My favorite restaurant in Portland hands down. I know its a chain restaurant but they give HUGE portions that are spot on every time. You get warm bread as you wait for your meal which is always something I look forward to. Their drinks are delicious and have a TON of food to choose from.

Z Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,575,67,2.0,7/13/2008,"I find it amusing that Cheesecake Factory has a Weight Management mini-menu that has salads that are around 590 calories.  Umm, how is that healthy?  Ugh.....well, whatever....the only thing that I usually get from there is the grilled cheese and I add tomatoes to it.  Healthy?  No...but one of the only items that I find tolerable there.  My husband likes the food more than I do but overall he just finds it OK.  He got the chicken piccatta today and said that it was (as usual) just 'OK'.   What I find even more bothersome than the food is the clientele.  Granted, I was eating there so I shouldn't be too critical but, check out these gems: #1:  Our buzzer rang along with a few other couples.  They had us all gather around the booth and still had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  This other woman that was waiting kept being super rude to everyone saying that people were cutting in front of her and that she was waiting too.  Ummm, yeah all of our buzzers went off...deal with it! #2:  OK, this one was really gross....This couple sitting next to us was sharing buffalo wings and fries.  After they were done the woman pulled out this cream from her purse and starting rubbing it on her foot.  While she was sitting at the table!!!!!!  She then put her bare foot back on the floor and then started eating her cheese cake with the same hands!  I was nauseous.  She then proceeded to point out all these pock marks on her arms and was discussing how much worse they used to be.  Oh, and then she picked at her teeth in the mirror before finally leaving. So, yeah.....all around, The Cheesecake Factory is just the pits.  Too expensive for the quality.  The portions are way too huge, I couldn't even finish the grilled cheese, I only ate half of it.  Oh, and I tried ordering the low carb, low sugar cheesecake and found out that they don't carry it anymore.  Granted, that does sound ridiculous (trying to order the low fat cheesecake) considering I ordered the grilled cheese but still..... I guess if you want a family friendly chain restaurant this is the place to go though, the strollers sure were lined up outside that place!  For some reason it is always crowded...no matter which Cheesecake Factory you go to and no matter when you go there is always a wait.  It just isn't for me.  One positive....it was a nice way to get out of the heat, the air conditioning was in high gear today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=400

Ron T.,"Portland, OR",167,624,296,3.0,7/13/2008,"We all know that waiting can be painful here specially during lunch/dinner time.  Here's a tip: Drop someone (preferrably the one member of your group who doesn't like shopping. They can people watch while waiting) by their door to get your tables later.  You can freely shop for around 20-30 mins cause that's how long the waiting time is. By the time you're done shopping, you've already developed an apetite for The Cheesecake Factory.  I would recommend their chicken marsala and veggie thai wrap. Have some dessert after. Try their seasonal cheesecake aside from their classics. You'll be in for a treat.  Their servings are huge.

My parents were in town visiting & we were at Washington Square doing some Christmas shopping. When we entered the parking lot of the mall, she saw Cheesecake Factory & said, ""Let's eat there, I got a $200 gift card!"" Of course we aren't going pass up on free lunch, so yes let's do it. The wait was about 15 minutes, not too bad at all considering at home it's about 30 minute - 45 minute way (sometimes an hour) but they did open a second location in Kapolei. Anyways, getting off topic... Our server was little all over the place & actually his behind bumped into my mom's shoulder a couple of times while he was talking to the table next to us (& he didn't apologize about it either). He would walk past our table, then it would kind of click in him that he forgot what we asked for.  Their fresh bread is super good, which my stomach definitely appreciated. Food: I've been dying to try their Thai Lettuce Wraps, Create Your Own Thai Lettuce Rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. It was soooooo good. I definitely would get that again! My fiancé ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair, Large Shrimp Sautéed with Tomatoes, Lemon, Garlic, Herbs and Fresh Basil on Top of Angel Hair Pasta with a Touch of Marinara Sauce. I ordered The Club, Freshly Roasted Turkey Breast, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayonnaise on White Toast. Served with French Fries or Green Salad.

At any rate, this one seemed a little sub-par. The wait was ridiculous. I get it if there aren't any tables, that's not what I mean. What I mean is, after our one hour wait for a table, we waited more than 40 minutes to get a server to acknowledge that we were there, and another 40 minutes before our food came out. TWO people ordered food that they were ""out"" of. I've always thought that Cheesecake Factory's menu was ridiculous and couldn't imagine what it takes to be able to offer basically EVERYTHING on their menu. It's not a problem in other locations, but what are the odds that TWO items aren't available because of a missing ingredient? INCONCEIVABLE! Or poorly planned/managed. I doubt they'll ever go out of business because of their location, and the food that we had was amazing - but the whole ""experience"" of dining was a bust this time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard

Came here to just grab a few beers and ended up getting some food towards the end. All-in-all, our waitress was really nice and responsive, checked-up on us the right amount and was prompt with getting us service. The place is nice on the inside and has a bit of an oceanic feel to it with the decor and lights.  I got a chipotle chicken sandwich, which was HUGE. It was only $13, but I swear it was an entire chicken breast, so I'm glad I got the salad on the side. The sandwich (it had a burger bun) was actually really good; the chicken was super juicy and the chipotle sauce gave some nice kick with the breading, and the vegetables (tomato, lettuce) were fresh. Other than the sheer size of it (which can be good or bad depending on how hungry you are), which made it a bit hard to eat, it was enjoyable.  The salad was a bit disappointing. I ordered blue cheese and when it arrived it looked soggy like it had dressing on it, but there was practically nothing on it. Seemed like they put a drop of salad dressing on it then mixed it up. Odd. I asked for some more and they gave me extra dressing so it wasn't a big deal but it was a bit confusing if they actually thought it had dressing on it.

However today was kind of a disappointment.. I usually order a range of dishes depending on my mood. Today I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and I think last time I had it was back in L.A. so it's been a good 5 years. It was saucy, chicken was nice and crispy, and the pasta was delicious. With that nostalgia and craving pasta, I decided to order it once more! However, the pasta was too dry this time, chicken was kind of on the softer side (not crispy) and I probably should have had it taken back and ordered something else but I was so starving I just dived in and by then, it was too late to return it. On the bright side, some dishes I highly recommend are: fried calamari, firecracker salmon, pasta da vinci, bistro shrimp pasta, crispy chicken costoletta (one of my favs), hibachi steak, and ribeye steak.

The robust Chicken BBQ Ranch salad rolls off the conveyor belt loaded with romaine lettuce, avocado, grilled corn and chicken, black beans, cucumber; tossed with moderately spicy ranch dressing then topped with soft yet crunchy deep fried zucchini rings. It is worth its weight in cogs and gears.  The dessert shift ramps into high gear and must be on double-time.   Our entrees find us too full with no room for dessert. At the Cheesecake Factory; a dessert emporium no less, the notion of walking away with no dessert is pretty much an oxymoron.  Countless choices fill the display cases.

We MUST stop the bedlam and choose a slice to go or cheesecake carnage will ensue.  So many choices!  We select a piece of cheesecake so thick and filled with gobs of milk chocolate, gooey caramel, crunchy peanut butter; topped with about five silos of rich, dense whipped cream, why a dedicated dessert conveyer belt alone must deliver this decadent dessert to our table.

I love that they have a extensive menu option for everybody to love. They choose from burgers to pastas to steak to salads. You name it. They start you off with complimentary (unlimited refill) of bread (sourdough & pumpernickel). Service was pretty good too. Water refills were on point. Food was pretty delicious, if you pick the right dish (I had chicken bellagio- chicken was a dry for my taste). Presentation was on point though, however the dim lights makes it hard to Instagram. I dislike the long wait. A party of 7 had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes before seated. Someone did keep coming to update us regarding the wait, however the way they said it sounds like they ONLY HAD ONE table that can accommodate our large party (they had to wait until that party to leave....)  The Cheesecake factory is a pretty big restaurant and you're telling me that you only have one table big enough for our party? dangggg, if it wasn't for a birthday gathering, I'd have left years go.

I had the bacon bacon burger and it was pretty tasty, it's huge by the way! The appetizer we had was a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon strips and it was cut into four squares.

I had a alcohol blended drink, it was all peach and it was SO good! Now the drawbacks, the restaurant is very dark, and VERY loud. And by loud I mean the music was just blaring. Our waiter was very nice, but he came by our table at least 30 times asking how everything was interrupting our conversation and it got to be annoying.

Michael E.,"Aloha, United States",0,3,,3.0,11/1/2018,"Regarding the cheesecake factory at the WA SQ Mall, from a point of view of a couple (we are both over 65 years old), here are our comments: The food was pretty good but the place was (A) too dark for us old-timers (we ate there for dinner). We had to use candles taken from the bar to be able to see the menu. and (B) the music is a bit too loud. It was too dang noisy for us ""over the hill"" types. A lower volume would be nice. On the plus side, the iced tea was good and the fried catfish was cooked just right (well done), and the Fish Tacos (tempura battered) were very good as well. The black beans were seasoned just right but the rice pilaf needs some improvement. It was too greasy. We also liked the dark bread and butter they serve with the meal. We were too stuffed to eat any cheesecake but next time we will get some. This was our first visit to this location.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard

Serena R.,"Lincoln City, United States",0,5,,5.0,4/2/2017,"Kudos to the team for handling a very challenging customer this evening!  This restaurant was busy and quite full on a Saturday evening. I chose to wait for a spot at the bar which ended up being a thirty minute wait. No problem for me, perfect time to do some people watching while my husband shopped in the mall I witnessed a lady get very disgruntled over the fact that some low tables in the bar area opened up and she was told she was not able to sit there. The staff member informed her super politely that these tables were part of the restaurant seating (which there was an hour wait for at this point) not bar seating. In her defense it isn't super obvious that this is the case while waiting for a spot at the bar. However my personal tactic would be to say okay and continue to wait for what is the bar section to open up. Not this lady! She proceeded to stop most every member of wait staff who walked by and engage other patrons in her frustration. Someone (I'm assuming a manager)came over and with wonderfully disarming body language and polite words she somewhat settled the lady. Fast forward another five minutes to getting a seat at the bar (where I got the distinct honor of sitting next to this gem). She was still berating the employees for the seating policy and all three of the people behind the bar were so respectful to her. She had some challenging requests like a not very sweet MaiTaiand she didn't like the lighting. I watched a waiter bring her a candle. Mostly the point of this ridiculously long post is to say well done staff! You all showed a lot of kindness and genuine care to someone who wasn't so easy to handle.

Andrea H.,"Beaverton, United States",60,175,28,2.0,5/1/2017,"After living right by this location for almost two years, we finally dined inside the actual restaurant. We've gotten takeout several times and it's always a nightmare. No matter what time of day you go, there are lines spilling to the door, the wait is long, and just trying to pay and pick up your food can easily take 20 minutes.  Nonetheless, we felt adventurous and thought perhaps going on a Monday at 5PM might help our chances. Nope. We walked in and stood in line for about 5 minutes to put our names down - 40 minute wait for a table for 4. We didn't feel like going anywhere else so we stuck with it. My parents went shopping and my husband and I somehow found a spot at the bar. Super friendly and attentive bartenders, and the happy hour menu was enticing just because of the value, but we figured we would wait to have food until being seated. We were seated after about 45 minutes, and were given a nice booth.  Our server was fine, nothing special. We ordered our food and it came out fairly quickly. Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered. However, my mom ordered the Chicken and Avocado salad, and it came with no avocado. The restaurant was so dark that I used the flashlight on my phone to get lighting so we could see if we were just crazy. No avocado in a salad that has avocado in the title? We thought maybe it was just at the bottom, but no, there was none. Simple mistake. However, when we told our server he looked at us like we were from another planet. He assured us there was avocado in the salad and left. My mom took several bites and there certainly was no avocado in her salad. We got him back over and he looked at us as if we were trying to pull something on him, so he just said he would bring her a side dish of a sliced up avocado. It was a weird exchange. I also had to remind him to bring me my side of fries, twice. I usually order the chicken salad sandwich because it's just that good, but this time it was bland and missing something. It seemed a bit dry and tasteless so i was disappointed.  Overall, it was a lackluster experience. I don't expect much from chains, but everything just seemed a bit disorganized and as if they didn't really care about their guests. Oh well.

After working 14 hours I was exhausted and hungry and wanted something non-takeout like. So I called and met Mike who was beyond helpful and friendly. You know how most places you call for takeout make you regret calling. I was in shock as to how easy it was. Then I went to pick it up and Mike brought it to my car with a smile.

My guy and I, on a date night using a gift card we received for Christmas, had the avocado eggrolls, a veggie burger with fries, and the falafel salad. All VERY good. I would highly recommend the cucumber lemonade!  Our waitress was friendly and efficient, keeping us moving through the dining experience quickly but not rudely. We were lucky enough to be seated in a dark corner for our date-night, which really added to the enjoyment.

I've had really great service and I've had incredibly bad service. It is what it is and I go here knowing what to expect, the bar isn't set high.  What I learned in my last visit is that they tend to always try to seat you in the lounge area unless you state a preference. This is a bad idea for you as a diner. The lounge is busy, it's loud, the tables are tiny, you're so close to your neighbor you might as well just share food, and almost every time I've had a bad service experience it's been in the lounge. So heed my advice, just sit in the dining room where you don't feel like a sardine in the middle of the stock exchange (seriously, where do all these food runners come from?? Where do they store them in the back?). I'm bumping them from 2-stars to 3 only because the cheesecake is so good and they have so many kinds.

Scott S.,"Keizer, United States",16,20,,2.0,22/6/2015,"We normally love Cheesecake factory. I am sure our recent experience was an anomaly, but worth writing about.  We called on Friday and asked about pre-ordering two cheesecakes for pickup late afternoon Saturday. They assured us this would not be a problem, took our name and number ans said they would be ready.  We showed up as planned the next day and went to the front counter and told them we were there to pick up our order. They scrambled around for about 15 minutes before finally telling us they were out of the key lime cheesecake size we ordered. How can a cheesecake factory be out of cheese cake, especially when it is ordered ahead. They offered to give us half a full sized cheese cake for the same price (it was supposedly more cake than the smaller one we ordered). Fortunately, it wasn't for a special event (it was for father's day, but my dad loved it in ANY form).  I was just disappointed the way they handled the situation (the staff were nice enough).  Not sure how to avoid this problem in the future.

Stephanie M.,"Eugene, United States",457,136,368,4.0,26/5/2015,"I hardly think I need to actually review the food here... I am a Cheesecake Factory snob... suffice it to say I drove 2 hours to be able to eat here for my birthday because there isn't one in Eugene... I used to live in San Diego and visited one at least once a week.  Here are some food suggestions -- Lemon Chicken Costoletta (sp?), Chicken Madeira, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps (yes its an appetizer and yes its big enough for an entree), Buffalo Chicken Blasts, Cajun Chicken Littles, Steak Diane, BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, Boston Salad -- the list actually goes on and on -- but these are some of my favorites! So this visit was a bit disappointing ONLY due to the fact that we waited 2 HOURS to get a table.  After driving 2 hours though I wasn't going to leave (which I believe the hostess secretly wanted actually). It was just too insanely busy though and it was rather disappointing to know that they were severely unorganized at the hostess stand.  Some people waiting near us had been told that they were out of pagers and to return in an hour to see where they were in line.  They came back in an hour and were told their name had already been called -- then after some insistence were told it would be only another 10 minutes and 30 minutes later they were called -- NOT OKAY -  Once seated, however, service was outstanding!  I love the food and drinks here.  I even took an extra entree home for lunch for the next couple of days.  Just be prepared for quite a wait...  LOVE this place -- definitely get the bread basket -- you can get it at lunch if you want just ask... dinner they should serve it automatically.  Also try the ranch they make it and it is  FANTASTIC! Cheesecake -- well I am not a sweet lover -- but you can't go wrong with their cheesecake -- really any of them -- I am on a mango key lime kick -- but others have served me well over the years.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=100
R C.,"Lake Oswego, United States",0,6,1,1.0,10/10/2016,"I feel bad for the wait staff having to serve the sub par food at this establishment. This was my second time to this location this year resulting in the same opinion of the food. Although my 1st visit did not receive a review, this one does.  My food came out warm(ish) and acceptable however my guest was not as lucky. Her tacos were ice cold and the (semi-soft) tortillas were cold and brittle. Sending the order back resulted in a 15 minute wait and an awkward eating arrangement as I had a plate and she did not. The replacement order of chicken tacos were slightly better and appeared fresher. However the portions of chicken in each was poultry. (Pun intended). If these are predetermined portions, someone needs a raise because they are saving The C.F. a ton in food costs. The meal was terrible! The manager on duty stopped by to offer his apologies and acknowledged that the replacement order was taking an inordinate amount of time as did our embarrassed server.  OK, here's the kicker.....$65.00 meal, cold food, measly portions and one returned entree. Not one item was comp'd, not a slice of cheesecake, glass of wine, beer.....nothing! I don't enjoy complaining or sending an item back and certainly don't make a habit of it but when I do I expect some form of compensation for the ineptitude of the kitchen staff. There are too many excellent places to eat in this town to have to suffer this places poor form again. The Cheesecake Factory should be ashamed of requiring their servers to present food like that! I doubt that I will return and hope that readers of this review choose other quality places around there like Nordstrom Cafe, Thirsty Lion or even Orange Julius for that matter.

We drooled over the Cheesecake display case while we waited. Menu is HUGE. There is something for everyone,  including my vegan husband. We order and about 30 minutes pass and I notice other tables getting their food before us. No biggie, we were all having fun in our conversations. Our server came over and apologized for the wait for our food, he accidentally forgot to put in my order correctly. Manager came by about 5 minutes later and once again apologized.  My husbands food comes out, as well as both my daughters. 5 minutes go by, still no food for me. Manager comes out with my food finally and she has the look of fear in her eyes. She apologies again profusely and tells me that my meal, along with my husbands app would be taken off my bill. I tell her that wasn't necessary but she insisted. She thanked me for not yelling at her like most people would. Why the 5 star rating?  Accidents happen. Food gets dropped, an order put in wrong, a ticket getting lost...

He came by and got our drink order, and then later delivered the drinks when he came to grab our food order. When he brought the drinks, he forgot half the drinks. Then after he grabbed our food order, he came over and brought bread and such. This is where EVERYTHING went downhill, and this is NOT the first time I've experienced this. After the food arrived, he forgot the cream and refills we asked for a while back. Then he came back by to tell my fiancé he forgot to put his order in, and that it would be out soon. While we are waiting for his food, the server neglects to tell us it will take a long time, and drops of some kind of soup to compensate for his late food I guess? We look at what kind of soup it is because the server never asked if he even wanted soup, nether the less what kind. It ends up being clam chowder, which my fiancé is allergic to shellfish. Wow.

The box and bag both leaked horribly though, even though I was VERY careful to keep it perfectly level. So the leftovers had to go straight to the trash.

I was surprised how good everything was. I mean I'd heard good things but their steak and cheesecake are terrific!

Jane V.,"Newberg, United States",43,197,362,3.0,8/12/2015,"Before we walked in we saw customers with the digital callers waiting for a table. Not a good sign. Walked through the restaurant door and 30 plus customers sitting, standing, and waiting to get signed up for a table. We headed straight to the bar hoping for a shorter wait.  The bar area is quite large with many tables and a long bar that must seat 20. Everything was full  except two chairs on the end of the bar. It was being cleaned off and we did not see anyone waiting. Lucky us. We snatched it up.  The bartender greeted us right away and asked if we are having cocktails and/or food. We took our time to order food since the menu is quite extensive. It was very difficult to read the menu due to the very dim lighting. We really like the atmosphere. The lighting made it quite intimate  even though the restaurant was packed. I guess this is when one can use their phone for additional lighting in reading the menu. I know my dad would not have been able to read it even with glasses. We ordered the bar size Asian salad and the Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries. My daughter and I share everything. Even with the smaller salad we could not finish it all. We thought the salad had a good combination of chicken and vegetables with some mandarin oranges and dressing. The Cuban sandwich  was on a baguette with a assortment of meats and a few pickles. Very simple, very filling, very large. The sandwich was brought to us with a side salad not the sweet potato fries as we ordered. I was surprised that the server took the salad of the plate in exchange for the fries. Not that we would have room to eat it anyway but most places just leave it and also bring the correct item. We waited for a good 10 minute for the fries. Got charged for them too. 10 minutes was a long time. We did not have dessert which I am sure going to The Cheesecake Factory and not having cheesecake is a crime. Maybe next time if we have a lighter lunch. I blame it on the bread and butter they offer after we ordered drinks.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=60

Service was very good and no complaints or issues. 3. The food is decent for a chain restaurant. I had a sandwich which was good but nothing special. GF had a salad which looked good.

A very nice breakfast menu, quite extensive.  I went with Huevos Rancheros.  Most of the time, this type of meal is quite simple, eggs with tortillas and a Mexican sauce and most of the time they taste pretty much the same.  But the sauce on this meal was excellent. Not too spicy, but not bland.  My friend's loved their omelettes and fresh fruit.

Teri E.,"Clackamas, United States",20,10,,1.0,12/12/2016,"We were directed to sit in the bar AT the bar for a busy lunch hour. The tables in the bar were also on the wait list for patrons. We obliged and the three of us sat at the bar. We ordered our drinks and bread as well as our entrees. One person with us was 17 but NO one told us she could not sit at the bar to eat as there were lots of kids already in the bar itself. The bartender asked her how old she was AFTER we had all ordered and of course she said she was 17. We were told she would have to stand behind us to eat as she could not ""sit"" at the bar itself. We were not directed to a free table which would have been appropriate since we had already ordered everything. We were told to go back to the front desk after we had already ordered. We saw an empty table on our way out and thought we could perhaps sit there since we had already ordered. ""NO"" was the answer due to the table being a wait list table. This was the WORST customer service we have EVER experienced! Unbelievable that we had ordered everything and were not given a table that was on the WAIT list since we HAD ordered already. ALSO, someone should have said prior to ordering that someone who was 17 would have to stand up at the bar rather than sitting down to eat. GOOD GRIEF. I would NEVER go here again, EVER!

Elizabeth L.,"Clackamas, United States",38,71,194,4.0,7/12/2013,"We tried The Cheesecake Factor for the first time this evening.  We arrived at dinner rush so I expected there to be a wait but not a 90 minute wait. Oh well not a huge deal as it is attached to the mall so we walked around while we waited for time to pass. When we were seated they brought our two year old a complimentary plate with bananas and bread on it. I wish more placed did this! Our waiter then came took our drink order, he returned right away with water and a coke but forgot my strawberry lemon-aid and then disappeared for 10 minutes still not bringing it when he came back.  He did eventually bring it but it took much longer than it ever should have even with them being busy.  We ordered tomato-basil pizza, shrimp scampi (served with angle hair pasta), and a side of french fries to share.  The portion of the fries was huge! Three to four people could definitely split this and not feel like they got cheated out of fries.  The kitchen messed up the pizza and they brought out a tomato-basil flat breas by mistake and just comped us that. This was good, the bread was thin and crisp the edges were not burnt nor were any of the toppings. It was light but better as a shared appetizer than a meal. The shrimp scampi was not 100% what I was expecting but it was good. The shrimp was large and was breaded and sautéed, no sauce on it. The pasta had a light garlic cream sauce which was very tasty but more sauce was definitely needed. Finally the pizza was brought out. I had them take it back and boxes up to take home so I cannot comment on it. Lastly we decided to order a dessert. We chose the Linda (?) cake it was very chocolaty and very rich between the two of us we did not finish half of it, but it was so good.

Meredith K.,"Portland, United States",14,15,1,2.0,2/1/2015,"We went here because we had a gift card from Christmas (we got a PetSmart card too, despite being anti-PetSmart, so go figure). It was a long day at work so we figured we would use the card and have a nice 15,000 calorie dinner (this is not an exaggeration). We get there around 5:40 on a Friday and it's packed. The place is fairly large and has twice as many tables than would be comfortable and there's still a huge line. We get the pager and learn it's an hour wait. Cue wandering around the mall... We ordered the buffalo blasts as an appetizer. I have no idea what we expected. It's basically a chicken and cheese pot sticker that you dip in buffalo sauce. On my first bite I immediately noted that the aftertaste is similar to the taste you get when you throw up in your mouth. I wish I was kidding.  I got the spicy cashew chicken as an entree which was entirely underwhelming. It was much more sweet and didn't even hint at being spicy. I'm a big spice fan so I expect a lack of heat, but come on. At least make an attempt! The rice was plain brown rice, not even jasmine. Womp womp. My boyfriend got the fish tacos which mostly like tasted like the lime he out on them. I had a piece of fish (tilapia, I believe) and could only taste the lime-- pretty strange concept. Of course, tilapia is always a mild taste but a disappointing choice for tacos.  We figured things couldn't get worse so we decided to shoot for the 1,000,000 calorie mark with the Reese's cheesecake. Definitely the best part of the meal, but that bar wasn't too high.  We had the leftovers boxed up and realized once we got to the car that we forgot them.

Chelsea Z.,"Ridgefield, United States",0,6,1,1.0,9/5/2015,"The waitress was good, her name is Kerri. The other food was good that my family got but my friend and I ordered pasta. Our pasta was cold-which was weird cause the plates were hot and the food came out quick- and the chicken was dry. The waitress was nice enough to get us new ones with even less than what we got before. The chicken was not worth the extra $3 we paid for. We all ordered cheesecake too. They were delicious (as always) except they said they were out of meringue for the topping on the lemon meringue, but didn't want to replace it.  This was a mother's outing for us, but my mother had the worst experience. She went to go to the bathroom and the stalls were all out of toilet seat covers. Because they were out of toilet seat covers you could see into the other stall! My mother came back surprised that there would not be solid panels in between each bathroom stall. When the waitress came back around she had the manager called over and when she explained the situation he just looked and said I'm sorry and walked away like it was no problem. We all had to go to the restroom while we waited for the check so four of us girls went so we could go in pairs so that we did not have anyone peeking through the hole in the panel at us. We went and all saw the hole for ourselves. There were still no toilet seat covers in either stall (this was 20 minutes after we had complained to the manager). So we once again informed the manager and a female employee that there was no toilet seat covers and that there was a hole in the wall. We insisted that the manager fix Tue problem and we would wait for him to finish before we went to the bathroom. He rolled his eyes and sighed at us, before going to fix the problem. This is a problem that needs to be fixed immediately with patching up the panel somehow. The manager was rude and didn't seem to care about any of our problems.

Laura D.,"Portland, United States",0,43,,1.0,5/5/2015,"Their food has gone downhill significantly over the last few years.  It used to be that when you went you'd get lush, soft warm bread to start the meal, followed by huge portions of decadent well seasoned food.  Now, you get hard lumps of partially burnt bread, followed by bland, dry, overcooked and under-seasoned food.  I emailed to follow up with the company after our most recent meal, and was informed that they did not have new staff nor had they changed the recipe for their whole wheat bread (which is the type we ate).  There was no excuse for why two out of three loaves of bread we received were burnt.  Nor for why all three of the loaves were super hard crusted with barely any softness to the inside (despite being freshly out of the oven). Nor for the dry, overcooked and under seasoned steak and shrimp.  Nor for the absurdly stale ""children's plate"" they brought when we arrived (with brown sliced bananas and hard little stubs of bread that looked like turds).   They offered to send us a gift card to try the place again (I suppose under the presumption that the staff simply had an off day), but it was for such a small amount it would be impossible for my family to try again without spending some of our own money.  And quite frankly, there are so many wonderful restaurants out there that I wouldn't risk spending money on another terrible meal here, even if half of it was paid for by somebody else... If you need to go someplace around the mall, try Red Lobster instead (just as expensive, but the food is well seasoned and not grossly overcooked).  If you're just looking for good food in general and location isn't as important, check out all the other wonderful places Yelp has to offer.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=180

On the positive: the service is very good. The few times I've been there. The servers have been prompt, attentive, knowledgable of the massive menu, and courteous.

When we got there they were out of pagers which should have been a sign, but we put our names in and were told to check back in 45 minutes (saying the wait was an hour). We did some window shopping and returned, only to be told the wait was another 40 minutes--but that the current wait was 2 hours, as if that were some consolation. We waited...and waited...and waited. 40 minutes came and went, husband checked on our status, was told another 5-10 minutes with only 5 other couples in front of us. 20 minutes after that, I sent him in to cancel our table, and it was finally ready. The table they took us to, in the bar, should not exist. It was up against a wall and less than 12"" from the couple next to us. Husband could barely get into his seat. His ass was basically in their dinner as he squeezed by. Awesome. We are not large people by any means. We wouldn't have been able to move our arms to eat, let alone converse, in the terrible configuration they stuck us in. We finally cut our losses (that would be 2 hours of our lives we'll never get back), and bailed.  We've gone to many very busy CCFs before, and have never had to wait more than about an hour, maybe 1:15 once. Clearly, this one has issues with slow service and/or food. We chose to leave hungry rather than endure any more torture to find out. Update 5/30: I contacted the restaurant directly after writing this review, expressing my concerns. I got a call from the manager saying he'd send me a gift card so I could try them again. 3 months later and I'm not holding my breath on him ever following through.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=240

Jenny S.,"Portland, United States",63,70,9,1.0,19/1/2016,"Loved the place until I found out their Cheesecakes aren't vegetarian and neither is their mac and cheese. I've been at least 4 times and ordered the same thing, the macaroni and cheese burger sub a veggie patty. The server said that she could do that, but that the macaroni and cheese balls contain meat broth as well as the cheese sauce that they put on it, so I may not want to eat it if I was a vegetarian. I am a vegetarian and I was incredibly upset that I hadn't been told the previous 4 times I had ordered this same meal. If you add meat to something that is generally meat-free, it should be noted on the menu and your staff should make it known to people who are specifically ordering their meals to be vegetarian. My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer while I looked for something else, but I wasn't really in the mood to eat there after that. I started looking at the desserts so we could get something to go. Our waitress noticed and informed me that the cheesecakes are made with animal based gelatin, which is completely unnecessary. Not only is there plant-based gelatin, but as a baker, I have made cheesecakes that didn't require gelatin and were the same rich consistency. TL;DR - Staff should make people aware of meat that is in dishes that are typically vegetarian, especially if the customer is altering the meal to replace meat with a veggie patty. I am incredibly upset that 4 servers didn't do so.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=140

It had just opened in our former city and everyone was still in love. We left unimpressed and not in any sort of hurry to visit another location again.  Fast forward a few years and now my husband won a gift card from work. We'd had it for a while and found ourselves with some unexpected free time, no dinner plans, and near this place. So, pretty much the perfect storm for dining here.  Oddly enough the wait wasn't that long. We were quoted 15 minutes, but didn't wait that long. Our server was lovely and nice. I just can not get over those menus, you know. I'm a fan of a one page menu and these give me some sort of anxiety. I even dissect the organization of sections. The novel-like menu turns me off like you wouldn't even believe. I seriously lose my appetite.  The food was ""eh"". It was really good, it wasn't the worst. It just tasted like any other chain that doesn't really stand out. I couldn't even remember what I had until I really thought about it. I had some sort of burger, my daughter had some type of pasta and I can't remember what my son and husband had. The kids had to have one of the cheesecake slices after the meal. I only had a little taste but found it to be too sweet.  Cheesecake Factory never leaves me feeling like I can't wait to come back.

Sure the cheesecakes are decent, some are even great, but overall I find the cheesecakes from my local bakery to be much better. Many of the cheesecakes at the Factory are waaaaay toooo sweet!! Total sweetness overload!  The food is...meh. I mean, it's not horrible by any means, and it is better than a million other joints, but the prices are steep, portions WAAAAAY toooo big, and the food is nothing to rave about. I would rather pay a smaller fee and get a much smaller portion and would likely dine here more if there was more selection in the smaller portion sizes. Put all that together and factor in the long wait to get a table on most days and times, and then factor in that you have a server who is mega busy waiting on table and likely to be less attentive than servers at less crowded establishments and it just doesn't make much sense to me why this place is so popular. One kudo I have to give the local Factory though is good management. Managers do show their faces and address problems. That is a big deal in my book!

Heather E.,"Chico, United States",2,97,,4.0,15/1/2013,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a weekday afternoon.  I wanted to go ""before the rush"" so I walked around the mall for a bit and then was seated around 5.   I was seated at a smaller table for two and promptly greeted by my server.  He brought water and asked if I had any questions about the menu. The menu is fantastic because there are so many different things to order, but at the same time, it takes forever to look at everything.  They serve breakfast all day, there's appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, simple dishes, fancier and more expensive dishes, a whole menu of ""skinnylicious"" items which are designed to be low-calorie, two full pages of desserts and on and on.  After taking probably 15 minutes to look over everything, I decided on a veggie burger and salad. My server brought two small loaves of bread (one wheat, one white) with really good real butter, and dinner came out shortly.  My veggie burger was AMAZING.  When you order veggie burgers at restaurants, most of the time they are handmade.  Some places use veggies and grains, others use black beans, every place kinda does their own thing.  Cheesecake Factory makes theirs with black beans, brown rice, farro grain, beets and onions.  It was so flavorful and unique and just simply amazing.   I also wanted to try some cheesecake because they're famous for it, so I decided on the original plain flavor.  I was actually really disappointed with my cheesecake selection.  The cheesecake is made with a lot of sour cream, and it definitely has that tangy flavor to it.  Also, it was really soft in the middle, almost running off my fork.  Maybe I'm just used to eating a more firm cheesecake, but regardless, I wasn't a big fan.  However, I don't think it would deter me from eating there or trying another dessert.  It could have just been a fluke. Overall, I'd say a great experience with good service and solidly good food.  Just, make sure you come early because this place gets really full really fast.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=280

This salad was the BEST I have ever ordered at any restaurant, EVER.  The LUAU Salad.  I love it when the lettuce isn't the main ingredient, but merely part of the whole!  This salad was loaded with tons of veggies, chicken, and mango.  Stacked on top are two GIANT wontons that cover the whole top.  The salad was way too big for me.

It was a good sized slice, (plus extra whip cream and banana slices), for the both of us to share; however, I think that $7-$8 for a slice of cheesecake is a little pricey. Sorry cheesecake factory.

My friend got a lunch salad, and it was still easily two meals.  Why everything (including the space and menu) is so enormous is beyond me.  Finished with Adam's cheesecake (can't remember exact name---but know there was peanut butter!), and it rocked.  A little creeped out that they are called the Cheesecake Factory, and don't make the cakes there.  Had chosen a different slice originally, and server said it ""just came off the truck and is still frozen"", so chose Adam's as my second pick.  I know they are a chain, but WHAT?   This being the case, I only gave it a 3-star rating, but it was a decent experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=280
Tatiana P.,"Junction City, United States",0,13,,1.0,6/10/2015,"Wow, I just left from one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The meal was bad from beginning to end and now I feel horribly sick. Not food poisoning sick, just sick from all the many many very bad quality ingredients that they use in their food. First of all, we started the meal with a margarita and a mai tai. The margarita was more like a waterita and the mai tai was one of the scariest cocktails I have ever tasted in my life. It tasted exactly like the syrup that maraschino cherries sit inside of. I could not drink it at all. Next, we asked the waiter for some glasses of water. Instead of bringing us both water, he only brings water for one person. One of the next times he came around I asked him to please bring another water. Instead of bringing another water, he quickly grabbed the 1 cup of water that was already there and refilled it and came back. Wow. Next, we had some guacamole which was actually not that bad aside from the salsa that accompanied it which was basically just diced tomatoes out of a can. After that, I ordered a margherita pizza. The pizza was one of the scariest parts of all. It was literally just pizza crust with a smear of sauce and some tiny scattered slices of mozzarella. All the places that did not have mozzarella we're literally just crust. Also, I just remembered I forgot to mention the chicken samosas. This was also one of the scariest parts of the meal by far. Usually samosas are made with a delicious combination of curried vegetables. The outside of the samosas were exactly like egg rolls and the inside was just ground chicken, that's it.  I instantly felt sick. What can I say, another way that a big restaurant chain in America is scamming Americans out of their money while getting rich and laughing about it. What is our country coming to?

Inside decor is fabulous, those lamps hanging from the ceiling must have cost a pretty penny. It's a bit dark, cold, and loud inside and some of the food can be a bit greasy. But overall food quality is very very good and fresh, and the atmosphere is just splendid. The menu is freaking huge and the cheesecake selection is naturally impressive as expected. The portion sizes are also generous. They clean the shrimp so I don't have to eat shrimp veins and shrimp poo like some places expect me to. Nice. Outside seating, yey! Service is pretty much consistently very good. I feel at home here, this is my kinda place. One star removed due to not taking reservations, being louder and darker than I like, and not offering happy hour on weekends or later on weekdays. But then again the happy hour isn't anything special, it's just half off fried appetizers. No need to speed on over from work to make it before it's over, order better stuff from the yummy regular menu. Maybe someday they will offer tastier and healthier HH options. People like to put down the chains. I call them chain snobs LOL. But you know what!??! I LOVE chains. Yeah, that's right. Chains rule. That's why their all over, because they kick butt. Not all, but enough of them to justify their existence. Their usually consistent at least, whether you like what they offer consistently or not. P.S.

The food was good. We ordered a few appetizers to share. The Vietnamese tacos were delicious. I thought I would like the avocado rolls more than I actually did. Don't order them unless you plan to eat them all on the same day. Having avocado in them, they obviously don't make good leftovers. We split the Farmhouse Cheeseburger.

I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory, was not overly excited to go, because I would generally rather try the local flair.  But I was with co-workers and majority rules, and for the most part, I am up for anything once.   We went on a Thursday evening, were quoted a 20 minute wait which was about 3 minutes.   I had the Ultimate Margarita that our fabulous waitress Nicole suggested.  I am glad I took her advice, this was well balanced, not too boozy, just a nice drink.  Sure, you pay for it, but I paid $8 for a lousy beer at an airport bar, so this is small potatoes. We had a couple apps, the ahi tuna and the artichoke dip.   I am not a big fan of tuna or artichoke, but I liked these, so they must have been OK. I bought into the hype and tried the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.   When the server set it down, I thought I made a horrible mistake.  I like spicy, but the first scent notes were FIRE IN THE HOLE!   But while I waited for the other entrees to be delivered, the aroma toned down, so I dove in.   Well done, but not the ""our #1 dish"" I was expecting.  Hype, ya know.    I tried the Steak Diane off another plate and it was the best bite of beef I have tasted in a long time.   Just lovely. We ordered cheesecake, I think there is a law that this is required.  Both the banana and the chocolate something something scrumptiousness were fantastic.  I suspect it is hard to get a bad dessert here.  What topped off the meal for me was our lovely server Nicole.  She quickly assessed that this was a table she could have a good laugh with and RAN with it.  We loved her!   She was quick witted, skilled at her craft and gave amazing service.    I would go back, certainly.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=340

The sauce was flavorful and not overwhelming, although I can always handle (and enjoy) the heat. Delicious. For the entree, I was served crusted chicken romano, with pasta underneath in a light red sauce. Very filling and no hint of being microwaved. Then....the cheesecake. Oh, the cheesecake. A slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake was the perfect ending to the meal.  The only downer was my seat. Usually when I go to a restaurant, a booth is my preferred place to sit. We were instead put at a table, one side with a chair, the other with the cushioned booth. You know what I'm talking about. I took the chair. Oops. Mistake of the day.

A man craves a beer in a mall. In Tigard. Panic? Shame spiral? AA? In a fit of all three I found myself in the CF right as happy hour ended, so the bar was packed with check payers. Not a seat in the house. After a few minutes the whole place cleared out and I grabbed a seat while the bussers and servers and barman tidied up the remaining service gear. I even got a, ""thank you for your patience, sir,"" from the busser as he ragged off the bar surface. I received a prompt, cold delicious beer selected from the bar menu that has no prices on it, which is but a minor annoyance. Ahh, sweet relief. Check the old iPhone and...oh yeah.

Martini glasses are being rimmed with blue sugar. The remaining bar seats are filling up. my beer is getting empty.

The selection is *huge*, if a little spendy, and in spite of a lot of their stuff being something I can't eat right now (I will be so glad when I can have dairy again, even with pills!), I was able to find plenty of good options. Because of the selection - if I had it to do again I'd review the menu online before going. Oops! I didn't like having to have the stroller away from our table and just set the carry-basket on the bench, but they were polite and helpful about it and I must agree that the available space they have would *not* work with the stroller parked at the table, not in the least. (I prefer not to set the basket on any raised surface, but it really was well-settled on the bench with the table helping keep it in place. And obviously the floor was a worse option.) The decor is beautiful, and I was astonished we didn't have to wait to be seated, considering we walked in during the brunch rush the Sunday before Christmas. The food was tasty; even my (finicky) toddler liked his meal. The portions are utterly huge - I saw people with ""appetizer"" salads that would be a whole meal for me. I ordered from the light menu and was stuffed even so - I'd have taken half a regular meal home, maybe more. The staff were incredible. Very helpful, very on top of things, very friendly and polite - just excellent service. We were actually seated while the ""regular"" server for our area was on his lunch break, and when he came back on, he immediately circulated all his tables making sure a) we had what we needed and b) we knew what he looked like to flag him down if we needed him. (Basic courtesy, but basic courtesy that is not always seen!) Also, the waitress who helped us while he was on break made sure we knew which page the Sunday brunch was on. My husband was sad to be so full he couldn't even face the dessert menu. (I would be, but their specialty is so far off my diet right now, I would be sad just looking at it.)

We arrived at 6pm on a Sunday evening, and had to wait for over an hour for a table. Once we were seated, it continued to go downhill. It is so loud, it was difficult to relax or communicate without shouting. It is so dark, it is really hard to read the menu.  While we were having our pre-dinner bread, we noticed that my spoon had food crusted on it, as did one of the plates. When presented to the waiter, his attitude was uncaring and he seemed annoyed by our concern.  The menu, while expansive is very random and the food choices are not paired well. For example, several dishes included a starch but not a vegetable. When we asked if my salmon came with a vegetable, the waiter simply said ""no"" and did not even offer any suggestions. Spaghetti did not include a salad, and once again no input from the waiter other than ""no"". The waiter told us that the items on the ""regular"" menu came in gigantic portions. However, the only things that were large were the plates and cheap starches such as potatoes and noodles. The meat and veggies were very very small portions.  Food was OK, but obviously prepackaged and reheated. Service was average at best, but we were forced into paying a 18% gratuity.

Anyway, we were seated and asked what we'd like to drink.  Our teas were brought along with bread/butter.  I wanted a nice casual meal and definitely didn't feel rushed at all on this particular visit.  Spazz got the hummus as an appetizer and I was surprised by the massive bowl of hummus delivered.  The bread was stacked beside the bowl.  I ate some of the hummus with the bread (not the pita bread).  Delicious.   We both ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (lunch-sized portions are $10.95 as opposed to the dinner-sized $13.95 portions).  I've ordered this dish nearly every time I've gone to Cheesecake Factory.  For some reason, this time was the absolute best I've had it.  It was FULL of pasta, sundried tomatoes, broccoli, eggplant, pine nuts, peppers, and kalamata olives.  I didn't feel like I ran out of anything before I was out of pasta, so it was perfect.   We mainly went here for lunch because we received a gift card for them.  In addition, we received 2 cards for free cheesecake.  Spazz is vegan, so it was up to me to pick a piece of cheesecake and bring it home.  I ended up getting one full of candy bar goodness and it's awesome!  I can't wait to go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=360

How large does it need to be? And many different cuisines?  What type of restaurant is this?  Italian? Burger joint?  Chinese?  Seafood?  Pizzeria? Pick a specialty and go with it. I'd can only imagine how they kitchen staff can prep for a service. With the menu so scattered, a feel like the quality goes down. Second gripe: lighting. I feel like I had to strain to see the person in front of me.  It was also kind of jarring to transition between the mall lighting and the restaurant lighting.  Last gripe:  the wait. Nearly an hour. It seemed a little excessive since the service and food were quick (one of the big pluses): the wait was probably due to people having too many choices on the menu.

The ambiance is nice, the service is nice, the seating options are nice (inside or outside- outside tables even have heaters!), and the wait is very moderate.  Only like 15 minutes and with the mall being right there, it was not a problem. I've had never really ""dined"" here in the sense that all I ever sat down and ate prior to Tuesday was the Cheesecake.  But on Tuesday, with Cheesecakes being half off and I having over $70 in gift cards, decided to sit down and experience the entire dinner.  And it was great.  The menu is huuuuge.  For the appetizer, I went with the fried avocado rolls, apparently one of their specialties, and it was awesome.  Very expensive, but truly something I'd never eaten before.  Tasted like a Chinese spring roll biting in but then immediately changed flavor to a more American taste.  For dinner, they have so many options that it's hard to decide what to get.  I was going to order from the Skinnylicious menu before I realized it's really the exact same thing as the normal menu except served in smaller portions, and hence cheaper.  So I ordered the normal veggie burger from the ""unhealthy menu"", probably having at least 800 calories, and it was delicious.  I also had some of the cheese pizza, which was excellent.   The desserts...  Before I even came, I knew was going to go with the cheesecake, but couldn't decide which one.  They are all extremely unhealthy, with some cakes having up to 1300-1500 calories in just one slice.  I didn't let that bother me and ultimately, I ordered the Godiva Cheesecake and split it.  It was a good thing I split it, because that thing was huge!  No one should be able to eat the entire thing after dinner and I'm not surprised it has that many calories.  For a four person family, you really only need two slices.  I also had some of the Tiramisu cheesecake, which was good, but nothing in comparison to the layered Godvida cake which was bursting with flavor.  I don't even remember what the layers were, but I remember it having a bottom brownie crust, a second layer consisting of cheesecake, actual Godiva chocolate in there somewhere, and topped with a bunch of whipped cream.   So yeah, excellent place.  And bill only came out to be $44 with tip for four people.  Pretty cheap considering we had no coupons.  Oh yeah, checked my weight the next day- not a single pound gained (hehe).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=360

Ariel M.,"Leawood, United States",23,66,13,4.0,11/3/2014,"Had the combo shrimp scampi and steak medallions for $19. So first off the meal itself did not fill me up but the mashed potatoes that came with it did. They weren't anything special but after eating a bit of it I just couldn't eat anymore. The steak and the shrimp however were amazing. The steak I had medium rare and it was amazing, great seasoning, perfectly balanced, and properly cooked. Then the sauce just pushed it over the edge and made it divine, I wish I had more of it. Then the scampi was also pretty amazing. The sauce it came with however was a little too overpowering, but when lightly applied to the shrimp it provided a good balance of flavor, I also wish I had more shrimp to eat, but between the two the steak would be the definite winner. If you want just the steak it was called Diane's steak. I also don't feel like they gave enough food for the money I paid but company meal, so I can't complain too much. Ambience was good, service was good, only down side was the last persons dish didn't come out till about 15 minutes later. They did end up giving the meal for free though along with a free soup or salad, would have been nice if they gave a free cheesecake slice though. Otherwise it was a great experience. P.S. - I'm not a fan of mashed potatoes, otherwise someone else probably would have enjoyed it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=300

Jeff H.,"Salem, United States",91,270,9,2.0,24/1/2012,"I debated two or three stars, and even though I didn't actively hate The Cheesecake Factory, I was just underwhelmed for what I got. It's a chain, but it's a high end chain.  The decor is over the top, but I can't help but feel like it's just trying too hard...like everything else here. The menu is huge and has a wide variety of styles and options.  Mexican, American, Italian, Asian, everything is represented.  I chose the orange chicken and my friend got a chicken salad.  We also had an order of fried cheese as an appetizer. Well, the fried cheese was actually kind of cold.  Cold like....out of a freezer and heated up and not quite gone all the way to hot.  Either that or it was sitting out for a while for somebody else, who didn't want it or forgot it, and we got it, because it came out almost immediately.  Eh.  It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't that great. Just like my orange chicken.  Not horrible, just...nothing special.  In fact, Panda Express does it equally well (if you get it right out of the fryer, at least). The complimentary bread to start with was very good though. A sour note was the diet coke I drank.  It came from the bar and presumably came from the cocktail gun...and was very watery and thin.  I guess it's mostly for mixed drinks, but still, it just wasn't that great.   And I like my diet coke, gosh darnit. All that for about fifty bucks.  It tried really hard...but it just wasn't that great.  I guess the emphasis is really on deserts, but since we were going to the Moonstruck Cafe later that night, we didn't want any of that. I don't see any particular reason to go back, but I wouldn't turn it down if someone else wanted to go there really bad.  It just would not be my first, second, or even third choice.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=300

Brett L.,"Portland, United States",35,113,18,3.0,21/5/2012,"This is one of those places that could easily be a 4 or even a 5 star review but just didn't quite make it there because of the overall atmosphere set by the staff. First, if you are going to have your staff dress in white, make sure it is a crisp clean white. The crew as a whole, other than the hostess was kind of dingy and frumpy.  Never once, other than tableside, did I see the staff smiling. The two female bartenders looked like they were moments away from shooting themselves in the face. Rarely have I encountered such a dour group of people in one spot. No one looked happy to be there, even though it is a beautiful restaurant  and one would imagine, a nice place to work. What should have been a fun experience, was just kind of depressing. If you are in upper management of Cheesecake Factory and you are reading this, take a look at the faces of the people working here. They are not happy. On to the better part of my experience, beer and food. I had the Salad Rolls and the Artichoke hearts and a nice cold IPA by Ninkasi. Salad rolls weren't the most beautifully crafted, but they tasted fresh and the accompanying peanut sauce was good as well. The Artichoke hearts were my favorite part of my visit.

You'd think the servers would catch it when they're bringing your wine to you or setting the table. Nope. And the manager Molly? Not only is she useless but actually she tried to come off like a heavy to me. She followed me out of the restaurant like I was being kicked out! Am I being kicked out? Am I being kicked out because I don't want to eat from dirty dishes and drink from dirty wineglasses? Then why am I being followed out the door? I turned to confront her and in her best nursie voice she said she just wanted to make sure I was OK. Huh? I'm a 55 year old woman exiting a restaurant because it's in violation of health codes. Of course I'm OK. Then she tells me, in her most manipulative way, if I'd fill out an incident report. Incident? What incident? She's creating one by treating me like this though. DIRTY DISHES, GLASSES and SILVERWARE are the incident. I, having standards, refuse to eat from filthy dishes. I guess that makes me ""trouble"". I wouldn't go here again if you actually paid me. I value my health too much. People are filthy. Look around. Would you want their mucous in your mouth? If not then stay away from this location because they simply do not clean their dishes, glasses and silverware. And the manager, Molly, is better suited to a nursing home than managing a restaurant.

When visiting from out of town, they'll make the Cheesecake Factory a destination, right alongside the outlet stores (which don't suck, really, I'm just saying it's a package deal). I used to not be a jerk and just go, just to spend time with my people, but I cannot do it anymore. I had to break it to them.   There are so sososo many good places to eat in Portland. SO MANY. The Cheesecake Factory is not one of them. The meat products have the texture of soggy sawdust mixed with wax. The cheesecake weirdly has the same texture. Everything comes with an extra helping of clogged arteries with none of the pesky flavor that gets in the way of a really unsatisfying meal.  It's not exactly false advertising. The cheesecake really does taste like it was made in a factory. Maybe a Jell-O factory. Maybe Dr. Scholl's. It's not the fault of the people who work here, either. I recognize that. Also, the space is huge and built for big gatherings and family-friendly, etc. Bully.  Were there not so many 5-star reviews of this place, I might be more inclined to give it a two just for kitsch.

Raja S.,"Hillsboro, United States",99,310,12,4.0,21/8/2011,"The first thing that you like about this restaurant (once your wait for seating is over) is the nice ambience for a restaurant jostled inside a mall.

The servcie is amazing, been there ~4 times and was always blown away by the service. The restaurant is almost always full, but they have enough servers to keep good check of all their customers. Coming to food, their menu is quite expansive. Some items are really good... we loved the Firecracker Salmon: yummy and spicy: an innovative dish and a must eat. We ordered the Jamaican Black pepper with Chicken and Shrimp - that turned out to be really good as well, the shrimp and chicken were cooked to the right amount (nice and juicy).  Avacodo rolls appetizer: very good.  The sauce (cilantro based) is very good. Chicken Madeira: Not so great. Herb Crust Salmon: Decent to good. Vanilla Cheesecake: Very good. 30th Anniversary Cheesecake: Awesome. Tiarmisu Cheesecake: Good, but not as good as other cheesecakes. Mango Keylime cheesecake: Just okay, my wife liked it however. On an earlier visit, I ordered their Chicken & Shrimp gumbo, which wasn't as spicy as expected.

So, while waiting (usually always packed) you can go for window shopping at the mall.

Any kind of cheesecake will not disappoint you. Pay attention, i said Good not exceptional. Nachos was pretty basic. The portion was huge but the taste was ""ummm"". Firecrackers salmon for appetizer is recommended. It was actually pretty good. For main dish, the most memorable one is cajun jambalaya pasta. The other pasta was pretty plain. But this one is pretty flavorful. The Atmosphere It was nice place to hang out with friend. I recommend to call in for reservation if you come in big group.

We got sat after two minutes on a Wednesday at 6pm, but it was at the tables where you're sitting pretty close to other people. A little loud inside and definitely funny when the people next to you can hear everything you talk about!  Our server (if I can remember, I think his name was Charlie), was very nice! Checked in on us, refilled drinks, and happily asked if we wanted more bread. It was great! I didn't get to try the cheesecake or any cocktails, but definitely will next time!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=20

Ernie C.,"Tigard, United States",232,92,13,4.0,21/4/2017,"For a national chain restaurant, this place is pretty great. There are plenty of options. In fact, sometimes it's takes us a little bit to figure out what to eat. They cover just about any kind of dietary restrictions, and offer quite a bit of ethnic style foods as well. For the price, portions are generous. They also offer many seasonal items as well.  Everything I've eaten here so far has been good. And, of course, the cheesecakes are the big reason why people come here.  The big drawback for me is the wait time to be seated. Do not, I repeat, do not come here if you're in any kind of rush as wait times can be over an hour, or longer on weekends.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=20

Here I appreciate the consistency of the food and good service.  I wish the location was larger and there were more seats because my complaints are that the wait is long to get a table and that it's too loud. It's so loud that the first time I brought a friend in, we walked in and out in under a minute. We couldn't tolerate the sheer volume. Perhaps, some soft sound dampening panels or curtains could be added? The only time it's not crazy loud is rare because the restaurant isn't full... which doesn't happen frequently. Maybe the corporate higher ups haven't been out to this location and experienced the decibel level of this location.

I literally got up and got a table. The bartender was just plain rude!!!  I don't care how busy you are, you can at least be courteous.  Barking at me, slamming dishes, acting like you are  too damn busy to hand me a menu and water?  Really?   2 nights ago I was in for happy hour. The girls are really sweet, but they are so busy chatting with each other they ignore customers. I Had to ask for water, then a menu then silverware, then a bread plate and finally interrupted them to ask for a drink. Come on!!!

Jennifer Y.,"Mililani, United States",117,109,291,5.0,11/11/2016,"THE LOCATION Perfectly situated at the ginormous Washington Square Mall, this restaurant is located in the Northwest corner of one of the top grossing malls per square footage in the US. It makes for a excellent pit stop to refuel and recharge before tackling the remaining acreage of the stores.  THE PARKING Endless and ample free lot parking surrounding the entire shopping center.  THE ATMOSPHERE The last time my husband and I visited a Cheesecake Factory was many many years ago. It was the one in Waikiki where it's always crowded, dimly lit and so noisy that you can't even hear yourself think. This location in Tigard was a pleasant surprise. As soon as you enter the restaurant, there's enough space in there to ballroom dance. The charming decor, elegant lighting, soothing color tones, exaggerated high ceilings and well-spaced tables make for a comfortable yet grand feel.  THE FOOD Even though it's typical Cheesecake Factory fare, it's consistent and done really well.  ---Teriyaki Chicken $16.95--- Sure it's not the best teriyaki chicken, but it's a good healthy alternative though it contains way too much sodium for someone on a low sodium diet. As usual, the portion size is generous. However, my husband didn't have any trouble polishing off the chicken and mashed potatoes plus 1/4 of my salad. He left the accompanying sautéed plantains untouched. I ate the sautéed pineapple chunks which came with his dish.  ---Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad, dinner size $14.95--- I love salads and this one certainly satisfies without high calorie ingredients like bleu cheese and bacon. It contained a generous mix of romaine lettuce, mixed greens, cubed avocado, a sprinkling of cashew nuts and some sliced chicken breast. The honey peanut dressing was requested on the side which was flavorful but turned out to be slightly too sweet for my taste.   THE SERVICE  Extremely professional, courteous, attentive and prompt.  THE BOTTOMLINE We would definitely return to this location again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=20

Mei W.,"Clackamas, United States",101,60,1048,1.0,26/3/2016,"My daughter requested a cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. So my husband called in an hour before to reserve a strawberry cheesecake. Most of us are lactose intolerant and therefore requested a 6 inch cake. Lucas confirmed over the phone they had it set aside for us.  I went in to pick up the cheesecake. I had to wait in line and when it was my turn, Lucas knew exactly who I was and told me the 6 inch strawberry cheesecake was no longer available. There were a few 6 inch plain and one strawberry in the front case. I asked if I can get one of those. He told me they are not for sale, although I saw someone pull some from the front case. I asked him what is the smallest cake he had and he told me a 10 inch one for double the price. Since it was my daughter's birthday and she specifically asked for it, I went ahead and bought it. Lucas told me they were ready made. I was very surprised to see him go in the back area and put strawberries on a plain cheesecake, then charge the higher price.  I had to wait over half an hour for Lucas to make the strawberry cheesecake. He did not apologize for the wait or say thank you. Will never go back nor recommend this place to anyone.  After reading a few other reviews, it is highly recommended to never pre-order a cheesecake here.

I was feeling a bit down/tired when we got in, but she lightened up the mood with her smiles and happy comments. When we placed our orders and the complimentary bread came in, I expressed my joy for the wheat bread of course, and she noticed it, and got us two more orders of he complimentary bread before came out. Now for the food, I had the southern grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The mashes avocado was so much goodness :), oh and the sweet potato fries, heaven; really well cooked and salted. I also got a strawberry smoothie which was really good and refreshing too. Come time for desserts, we mentioned it was my cousin's birthday and she was like oh nice, they do have complimentary sundaes for people celebrating their birthdays and that they would sing too. And so more servers from the restaurant came in and we all sang cheerfully for him. Such a great experience. We also got some order of cheesecake slices to, and she made sure to pick out the biggest slice for me :). Of course I got the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. It's usually my favorite.

The place was packed, which is always a good sign, and the menu was abundant, so I ordered a steak and asked what the ""veg"" was that came with it...the waiter said, ""I believe it's either green beans or asparagus, do you have a preference?"" Why, yes, kind sir...I hate asparagus just a tad less than green beans, so let's go with that. The steak was ""meh."" I've actually had a better one at Denny's, and the mashed potatoes were VERY peppery, but still quite good. The asparagus was cooked in a way that doesn't disguise the fact it is asparagus, so that stayed on the plate. Cheesecake was fine, but not as good at Costco's cheesecake (you know what I'm talking about, people...Costco's is orgasmic).  Now, time for the bill. They up-charged me $1.50 for the asparagus. Oh, hell, no. Not only did you give me that as a choice, you NEVER mentioned an up-charge and then when I bring it to your attention, you ARGUE with me?

I have had it in Indiana as well and it was extremely good there. The last two times I've had it here at this particular location, was put together very quickly, hardly had any of the ingredients on it that was supposed to come with it. The dressing that they put on the side was very sparse. After I expressly told the server when I ordered it that I would like the dressing on the salad, as this was a kale Salad which is a lot better when the salad dressing is massaged into it.

The three of us would travel down from Portland OR to Washington Square just to eat at Cheesecake Factory. However the downfall to this is that me and my family tend to visit during their busy hours ( past 7-8 pm on weekends ) which usually have us waiting between 40 minutes or an hour just to get our table for 3 people. Depending if the mall is close or not, my family just buys time by shopping around the mall till the buzzer, buzzes us up. Service quality is quite nice but sometimes we would get a server who's not really on task. A man once forgot to give us our bread till our main course came out but he was giving other people their breads and helping them but did not bother to check on us and when we asked him to, to-go our cheesecakes he said he already told the front desk to have them in their boxes, but then they ended up bringing the cheesecakes in their plates and not in boxes.  But besides that one server who wasn't so great towards me and my family, the others who served us were great and nice.

The cheesecake is always so fresh and good! My favorite is the key lime. But the red velvet is also amazing! Food wise, I've been happy with salads, the shepherds pie, chicken parmesan, and I was super surprised at how great even their nachos were! The only downfall is that they are pretty expensive.

The Cheesecake Factory is like Disneyland or Disney World; everyone wants to go but there are far better places to visit. Both my friend and I had never been and wanted to see what it was like. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, which was $11.95. Portions are huge and the prices are a bit high for a chain, but I've noticed prices are up everywhere in all restaurants, and so it goes... The sandwich was served with the sauce on the side, so I had to dip my sandwich in the sauce, which made eating it awkward. It was good, but I wish I went for something lighter. Warm bread is provided before the meal. If you order a drink, it's served in huge glasses and water is served in plastic beer mugs. Maybe it was me, but the food seemed rather salty because I actually asked for a Coke (I typically don't drink Coke or any soda at meals) because I needed something sweet to balance out the saltiness of the meal.  It's VERY noisy, so don't expect a romantic evening without the kids unless you like it noisy.

I hate waiting, and I definitely hate having to wait in a confined area, so I usually go to the Cheesecake around 2 o'clock to beat the lunch crowd.  I do notice, though, that once you're seated, whether during prime-time or down-time, you're attended to quickly and your order comes out at a reasonable time. I've come to realize, after trying their pizzas, pastas, salads and other entrees, that I'm not a fan of the food here.  Not only are their portions larger than life, but the food itself isn't very inspiring.  I'm looking for quality, not quantity!!! Why 3 stars then, instead of 1 or 2?  Well, for one, as I've mentioned, the service is quick once you're seated.  Two, I love love love their strawberry shortcake with its juicy, sweet strawberries and heaping scoop of ice cream.  && three, I liked that their mojitos come with a ton of mint leaves!

So, yeah.....all around, The Cheesecake Factory is just the pits.  Too expensive for the quality.  The portions are way too huge, I couldn't even finish the grilled cheese, I only ate half of it.  Oh, and I tried ordering the low carb, low sugar cheesecake and found out that they don't carry it anymore.  Granted, that does sound ridiculous (trying to order the low fat cheesecake) considering I ordered the grilled cheese but still..... I guess if you want a family friendly chain restaurant this is the place to go though, the strollers sure were lined up outside that place!  For some reason it is always crowded...no matter which Cheesecake Factory you go to and no matter when you go there is always a wait.  It just isn't for me.  One positive....it was a nice way to get out of the heat, the air conditioning was in high gear today.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=400

Ron T.,"Portland, United States",167,624,296,3.0,13/7/2008,"We all know that waiting can be painful here specially during lunch/dinner time.  Here's a tip: Drop someone (preferrably the one member of your group who doesn't like shopping. They can people watch while waiting) by their door to get your tables later.  You can freely shop for around 20-30 mins cause that's how long the waiting time is. By the time you're done shopping, you've already developed an apetite for The Cheesecake Factory.  I would recommend their chicken marsala and veggie thai wrap. Have some dessert after. Try their seasonal cheesecake aside from their classics. You'll be in for a treat.  Their servings are huge.

Brian I.,"West Linn, United States",62,256,33,4.0,25/7/2010,"The architecture of the interior of The Cheesecake Factory, to me, feels distinctly like I'm in a buffet at any casino in Las Vegas.  Huge, soaring ceilings with unnecessarily intricate artwork, carefully planned lighting - everything you'd expect from said casino.  I definitely prefer more intimate settings, but CF gets away with it. We started with the corn fritter appetizer, and honestly I wasn't expecting much.  They exceeded expectations.  Sweet little fried balls of corn/batter goodness with some kinda tangy/salty dipping sauce. I had the fried shrimp platter, which includes several nicely fried jumbo shrimp, fries and some cole slaw.  The shrimp were prepared exactly to my liking, they were crispy, fresh and tasty.  I didn't particularly care for the fries, but I really enjoyed the cole slaw.  Crisp, tangy and a nice way to clean your palate between bites of shrimp. Mrs. Brian I. had the vegetable salad, minus cheese, dressing on the side.  This is a giant freaking salad, and she was entirely happy with it.  The veggies were fresh and crisp. Semi-unrelated: I find CF's website hilarious.  You're ""greeted"" by this animated server that explains various aspects of the restaurant.  The way they've animated her is... acceptable, but her movements remind of the strippers in the original Duke Nukem game.  Kinda jerky, strangely robotic animation.  Hilarious. Back on topic: CF gets an extra star from me for 2 reasons.  First, they have Mac & Jack's African Amber on tap - one of my absolute favorites and seemingly a rarity around town.  Second, for our server, Jen.  I'm really picky about ordering shrimp.  If it's not cleaned/deveined then I have a real problem with it.  When I asked her if the shrimp on the platter were cleaned and deveined I wasn't expecting her to know.  However, she immediately responded ""Yes, they're cleaned, deveined, breaded and fried in-house"".  I was thoroughly impressed. I recognize why CF has averaged 3 stars over the course of it's reviews.  I think they deserve a 4th star because the place is simply ""working as intended"".",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=380

It's like you're in heaven. There are plenty of selections for you to chose from. Which is definitely a plus since I'm not a huge fan of chocholate it's nice to know that there's a place that will have a very good selection.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=440
Jessica M.,"Hollister, United States",4,4,1,4.0,23/7/2012,"My family and i went to the cheesecake factory today for dinner and indulged ourselves quite a bit. but fist, let me go over the service. We where seated quickly (but it was an odd hous 4:30ish), our waitress was amazing, she went over what the specials/soups of the day where before we had to ask and wasn't fake at all and was extremely plesant. As for the food, we where brought bread to munch on, a small white french loaf and a small brown bread loaf with oats on the top, and they also brought butter pats.The menu was huge and they have a vey nice bar with plenty to choose from, they also have a new skinylicious menu for the ones watching their weight. We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese (extremely fatty and caloric i know but as i said, we indulged ourselves tonight), and it was amazing. The noodles where well cooked and not soggy or dry from being fried, the sauce was very flavorfull, and the breading kept everything together well. They put a cream marinara on the bottom of the plate for dipping and my family and i agreed that it was perfect with the macaroni balls, (did i say they where formed in four golf ball-sized portions on the plate? no? well now i did.) My dad ordered the fetutini alfredo with a side of sauteed spinach and the spinach was cooked only with a little butter, salt, and pepper in a cast iron pan. my dad said the pasta was well cooked in the alfredo, the sauce wasn't too thick or to runny and he said it stuck well to the pasta. I had a chipotle crispy chicken sandwich on a kaiser roll. the only thing chipotle about it was a mayo sauce.I agreed with my mom's following notes on the fies but i liked them that way. Mom had a wild mushroom burger, she said it was tender she asked for rare and got blood rare ""the way she likes it"". she didn't like her french fries, had potential with seasoning, but where twice cooked which made them rubbery. After dinner my family and i decided to have desert which i extremely recommend, dad had the red velvet cheesecake, he says it was very good. (not very talkative tonight) Lol. Mom had the Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake she said the sauce topping was way too tart so she pushed it off to the side, commented that the whipped cream on the side was nice and tasty, also said the amount was just right. Both my parents had coffee's which had been freshly brewed, mom said it was above average coffee, i observed that it was quite hot, needed 3 sugars and plenty of cream, depending on who was drinking it. I had a cappucino which was, fair warning- huge, alot larger than your average cap. So i had the adams penut butter fudge ripple cheesecake, which was, O.M.G. Indulgent, it had Resse's on the top, caramel, cookie bottom, and choco swirls, with a topping swirl of penut butter icing. It was amazing. Beware and prepare for a sugar high! All in All, we loved it, it was our first time to a cheesecake factory and we where extremely happy.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=440

WTF????? helllls no. i call the manager. he says, on let me check and see about that, that's not right. im standing in front of him waiting to hear whats up.. and he get's diverted. then a party of 10 gets called in and then a table of 8 get's called in.. more time pass and i'm like, for real can you tell me how long the wait is now because we're all here all waiting and it's been over an hour and a half. so he said, okay looks like the table we have you guys set up for has people still there, they have already paid and usually we estimate a big party to dine for about an hour to tops an hour and a half. it's now been an hour and 45 minutes and it's our policy that we can't ask them to leave. sooo i'm like damn if you guys can't ask, i sure as hell can. he standing there offering free appetizers and stuff.. im like damn. and just as i was going to walk over there, the party decides to leave. so he's like, a few minutes as we clean your table. great. they pretty much gave our table away and mixed up our ""reservations"" big bunch of jerks. manager was nice afterwards.. and our waitresses weren't terrible. food was good and the cheese cake was even better. i got the factory chopped salad and b had the meatloaf. both never fail and b had an extra slice to take to work in a meatloaf sandwich whoop whoop! friends had really good food too.. bbq salmon, mushroom burger, tomato basil shrimp angel hair. i know for sure the tomato basil shrimp pasta was good.. as for everything else, i didn't get to try it. everything was pretty spendy. i wasn't so happy about my drink. they DO NOT make a mean mojito. don't get it here. what else..? that's all for now. ill update if there's more. 3.5 stars for the food. 1 star for the customer service. ultimate FAIL in customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=440

Thorby B.,"Novato, United States",1,102,4,4.0,30/12/2010,"Having been to two Cheescake Factory locations in the S.F. Bay Area, I entered this one with low expectations and a high degree of certainty that I would be in for a long wait for a table, mediocre service, average food and great desserts.  That way, I knew I would not be disappointed. While the wait WAS long (over an hour when we were told 30 minutes) we were a large party to accommodate and I was anticipating the wait.  But, the rest of my somewhat low and negative expectations were turned upside-down. Food was very good to excellent for all diners.  We had one entree that experienced a kitchen delay.  But the server quickly explained what the problem was along with a very sincere apology.  Because the portions are so large, two in our party eventually wound up sharing a VERY large entree and the ""problem entree"" was then canceled.  Absolutely no problem.  Even the manager came over to inquire, ensure everything was satisfactory and apologize for the kitchen's error, made sure we understood what had caused the problem and sincerely apologized AGAIN.  In our collective minds the problem was very minor but the wait-staff's treatment of it and of us was golden. The service:  absolutely excellent all around.  Water glasses constantly filled.  Ice tea refilled.  Bread refilled.  Very quick acknowledgement, a smile and an ""absolutely no problem"" attitude throughout the meal.  Personal, yet appropriate, conversation with the server.  This location could and should give customer service lessons and training to the S.F.

Alyssa V.,"Salem, United States",0,6,,5.0,23/2/2012,"My husband and I decided, on a whim, to go there last night (a Wednesday around 7:00 p.m.) for dinner. We have been meaning to go for a couple years, and decided to finally try it.  We were seated VERY quickly. As in, we checked in and less than 5 minutes later were being taken to our table. Our waiter (named Donovan) asked us how we were, to which we replied good and that we had never been there before. His first warning: the menu is very big. As in, 20 pages and then a couple for the cheesecakes and drinks. They also had a ""skinnylicious"" menu, which were all under 590 calories and smaller portions. He recommended a few things, let us know about their loaded baked potato soup, and then excused himself to get us some water. After bringing the waters and taking down our orders for strawberry lemonade (which was the best we had ever had), we looked over the menu. As our server passed by with cheesecakes, he would stop and briefly show them to use, tell us which one it is, and explain what was in it. We finally decided on the chicken madeira and the soup for me, and my husband had the spicy cashew chicken. The soup was great, and although I ordered the cup, it was the size of a bowl. Definitely glad I didn't get the bowl. They might have brought me a trough! When he brought us our entrees, I was shocked at the size of the plate. Two pieces of chicken the size of my head, and a hefty serving of mashed potatoes. I wasn't wild over the sauce, but it was still very good. It also came with steamed asparagus, which was done perfectly. The mashed potatoes (made with red potatoes) were well seasoned. I barely made a dent in my food. My husbands chicken was spicy, but not overly so. He asked for the brown rice, which complimented the chicken wonderfully. He actually ate half of his plate. Thanks to the cheesecakes our server had shown us, it wasn't hard to decide which ones to get. My husband got Adam's peanut butter cup cheesecake, and I ordered the Banana cream. We very light and creamy, and a fairly large slice topped with whip cream (mine also had freshly sliced bananas on it). I was shocked at our bill as I wasn't paying too close to the price (about $63), but very satisfied with the quality of food and service we got.

Main course: Miso Salmon, Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Pasta Carnonara. Our collective feedback in short: The chef delivered as promised.   Dessert: I don't remember the kind of cheesecake, but it had 3 layers, we each got a slice and we ate in silence - it was a good kind of silence and the kind of silence that you go into when you're indulging in a guilty pleasure ( I'll be paying my dues for this indulgence by running 4 miles tomorrow morning) The expected wait time when we checked in today was 25 - 40 minutes.

Liz T.,"Portland, United States",9,34,1,5.0,27/9/2007,"Thank you franchise gods for bringing The Cheesecake Factory to our world of small plates and foreign language menus! I first fell in love with The Cheesecake Factory at their original location in Beverly Hills, where the restaurant is more like an old house and seating is limited so I can see how some may be overwhelmed by the atmosphere and design of the large Washington Square location, but no matter which location  you're at, you will be served the same great food.  Yes the portions are large, but that's what to-go boxes and the gym are for. To me (a girl who likes to eat and get what she's paying for) large portions earn the restaurant a star, as long as the food is good, and it is! My favorite is the four cheese pasta, but I've taken everyone I know to the Cheesecake Factory and I've never heard a complaint about what was served, from the salads to the Cajun chicken littles to the appetizers.  Along with  your main course, they serve two kinds of super yummy bread and of course cheesecake. They always have about 30 flavors of cheesecake to choose from and they're all quite tasty. They range from great plain cheesecake with fresh fruit, to peanut butter-cookie dough cheesecake. Many are quite rich so I do vote share or get another to-go box. If you go on the weekend you will more than likely have to wait a while for your table, but it's worth it. They have a nice bar with yummy Bellini's (and other drinks) if you wanna grab a drink while you wait. Or you can venture into the mall and people watch.  Bottom line- You will not leave hungry, but you will leave wanting more!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=420

The menu is huge, you really can't go wrong and the cheesecakes are to die for! We had the fried macaroni which was great and the crab dip, yummy as well.  He ordered a burger and I had the fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes.  For dessert we had the red velvet cheese cake which was SO GOOD, he looked at me and was like ""we have to have this for our wedding cake!!!"".  We also tried Linda's chocolate cake, and the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake they were both very tasty but rich.  The service was wonderful, we couldn't stop raving about how nice our waiter was, he always made sure we had refills and was checking in on us he was EXCELLENT!

Jerry M.,"Portland, United States",8,495,1325,5.0,14/5/2015,"I know the Cheesecake Factory is usually really busy at dinner time which can mean a long wait.  So, we went early (just a few minutes after 5 o'clock) and were seated immediately, getting dinner off to a good start.  Service was friendly and efficient.  We asked if they had a ""happy hour"" and our server explained that was available only at the bar, and she was willing to relocate us there if we wanted.  We decided to just stay in the dining area and order from the regular menu.  Well, their menu is huge with lots of things to choose from.  She brought us a couple of tasty baguettes to munch on while we were deciding.  One was a sweet dark bread, and the other was a crusty sourdough.  Good stuff.  I ordered Chicken Madeira for my entree.  It consisted of two chicken breasts pounded flat and coated with egg, then sauteed. This was covered with melted mozzarella cheese and Madeira sauce with mushrooms.  It also included asparagus spears and skin-on mashed potatoes.  It was totally excellent, and the portions were good sized.  My friend ordered Garlic Noodles.  It had asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes, and grated Parmesan in the garlic sauce with the noodles.  The noodles were cooked just right, with the proper firmness.  She really liked it. . .and finished off every bit of it.  Even though we were at the Cheesecake Factory, I'm not too fond of cheesecake, but I do love chocolate.  So, for dessert, I had a slice of Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake.  It has alternating layers of chocolate fudge cake and chocolate mousse.  I liked that it was moist and ""pliable"", not dense and hard like some chocolate desserts tend to be.  There were three big blobs of whipped cream to dip each bite into as well.  It was BIG too. . .not some little bitty slice like at some other places.  OK, I think the Cheesecake Factory has all the good qualities I look for:  good food, generous portions, fair prices, friendly and efficient service, and it's a nice looking place too.  It's really obvious to me why it's such a popular and busy place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=220

Every time I go there I have to add one more thing to the list that I will never order again.  Your restaurant needs to get it together.  I wrote a complaint online so hopefully I will hear back.  Just over it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=220

I say normally but that really means that this was my 6th trip ever- I manage to get invited to an outing there about once a year. Good service, remarkably quiet, tasty if unimaginative food (I had a club sandwich and fries, both of which were done well, seasoned and prepared to my specifications). We ordered a series of decadent and delicious cheesecakes to share, all chocolatey and all were consumed to the very last crumb. All of that said, it's a place that's fun to go for a group event when you want a wide selection of desserts to end the meal with and you don't mind waiting for a table.

Michael X.,"Newport Beach, United States",0,148,4,1.0,11/10/2013,"I only leave one star reviews for dishonest businesses or absolutely horrible experiences - this one is for the latter. I've been to this Cheesecake factory location a few times, and have been underwhelmed each time.  But my visit last night takes the cake, no pun intended.   Before I get to last night, I've been to quite a number of Cheesecake factory locations and this one by far is the worst I've been to.  For starters, they seem to have somehow packed in way more seats than they should have - you're literally bumping elbows with the people sitting next to you.  Not pleasant.  Next, in my opinion, the food at this location is not as good as the other CF's I've visited.  So last night, I happen to be close to this location and for some reason decide to stop here for a meal.  I go up to the reception area, told that it's a 10-15 minute wait, say that's fine, handed a pager, and I have a seat and wait.  Pager goes off, ushered over to my table (which is about the right size for an elf) yet the table hasn't even been cleaned yet.  So I patiently wait until it's cleaned and sit down.  No menu, so as soon as my server comes over, I kindly ask for a menu.  She then has the audacity to ask me where I came from and did I come from up-front - clearly implying by her words and tone that I had somehow cut in front of everyone else waiting and just plopped down at this table. I'm thinking really? did this person really just ask me that question? Given the elbow to elbow seating, I waited for the people sitting next to me to leave before I spoke to my server - as I didn't want to embarrass her in front of those people.  Yeah, I had a little more respect for her then she had for me. So the people next to me leave, and I tell her how inappropriate it was to tell a customer that, clearly implying they're some dishonest schmuck who can't wait in a line.  She goes on to say something along the lines of ""well we have a problem with that"" - people just sitting down apparently.  And how that's my problem, I've yet to understand.  Total lack of accountability and I think my telling her this sailed right over her head.  If this location has a problem with people sitting down at tables, perhaps they should look into fixing their seating issues, but treating customers like criminals is totally inexcusable.  Needless to say I won't be going back to this establishment again.  Even despite this unfortunate event, this particular Cheesecake factory isn't worth waiting in line 30 seconds for.   PS: The manager, at least it seemed to be the manager, was going from table to table like some Disneyland automaton asking each person the exact same canned question if they were enjoying their ""experience"" or something along those lines - with as much genuine interest as some Washington DC politician.  He didn't even seem to pause long enough to hear someone's answer :) Priceless.

This location in a mall does nothing for their ambiance and last time I was here they totally screwed up my order. Pretty upsetting when my party was waiting unusually long for our meal to begin with, they gave me the wrong dish, and then made it again, which took so, so long. I finally just asked them to package it to go. To make matters worse, it was almost more irritating when the manager comes to our table to apologize, nice gesture, but I just wanted it fixed in a timely matter and not once did he offer to compensate the meal which would have been nice given this particular incident.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=220

Since we had two trips to Washington Square Mall-and it was the daughter and SIL who are doing the low/no carb diet, we decided that CF would give them the most options. What we found at this location is that the service is wonderful(on both visits) but the food is inconsistent. CF, all over the nation is in the process of rolling out their new ""Skinnylicious menu"" that won't hit the Bay Area until the 9th or 11th of September. It just rolled out here in Oregon this past week and my theory as to why my staple (miso salmon) was off both times I ordered it is simply because the new menu (with 40+) items is just a tad overwhelming for the kitchen to learn and the rest of the staff to execute.  The management here is great-offering to fix just about anything, giving us gift cards to return (Tuesday's gift card was used Thursday), wanting to give us dessert either to eat there or to go, etc. We declined the dessert but the attempt to ""make it right"" would make both Tim Gunn and Gorden Ramsey happy.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-tigard?start=220
