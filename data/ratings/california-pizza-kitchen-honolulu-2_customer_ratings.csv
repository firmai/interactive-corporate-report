Pastas are also very good, my favorites are the jambalaya and the asparagus/spinach/tomato with salmon added. Beer is limited to Samuel Adams, Bud Light and Longboard draft; bottled beer selection is decent but not outstanding. Wine selections are adequate. Desserts i usually skip.

The only variable is the service, which is often times the unknown factor that can make or break your dining experience.  Lately their servers have been awesome but I can't say the same for their managers.  I once got food poisoning and I commented on their site.  The manager got back to me same day (which I was happy about) but then promised a letter in the mail of some sort and it NEVER came.  This was about a month or so (not too sure) ago and I know the mail doesn't even take that long from Europe.  So one strike for him.  Another strike for the manager this past friday when we dined (2/24 I think I wrote the incorrect date before) during lunch and he had no personality and was not even sincere.  He asked how we were doing and before we could complete our sentence, he had WALKED AWAY.  I was so upset that he was that rude to us.  At least let your customer answer before walking away.  Don't bother if you're going to be insincere and not even care about your customers.   So while the food is superb for a chain and my favorite place to eat most times, I can't understand their customer service.  However, the waitress and waiter that we had the last few times never let our glasses completely empty.  So yay for those people =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=360,3.84,3.82,3.82,2.8600000000000003,3.8280000000000003

The wait time averages from about 30 min to 45 min most of the time. Parking can be difficult but if you are having difficulty, I recommend parking in other areas of the mall and walking. Service is always friend and nice, but slow. I don't mind though. I never like to feel rushed when I'm at a restaurant. As long as you can find your server when you need them, I'm happy.  My favorites at this restaurant are their avocado egg rolls, original bbq chicken chopped salad, and chicken tequila fettuccine. I recently discovered that I could switch my type of pasta and I have to say that I've fallen in love! If you love the chicken tequila, try it with a skinnier pasta like linguine or spaghetti. The pasta absorbs the sauce so much better an makes the dish so much tastier. It's been on my mind ever since I discovered it! I think I might go back for a second round.

I usually tend to go the the Ala Moana CPK because, I feel, the service is better than the other CPK's on island.  We had about an hour to spare before our movie started and decided to grab a quick bite. We were seated immediately (PLUS) and our waitress came over to take our order (PLUS AGAIN).

Out comes the appetizer...waters (sans lemon) and no bread...Cool...we'll just ask again...""Could we get bread, please?"".... main dishes came out...no bread... Fine...maybe we didn't need bread because our food came out in a timely manner.  ""Hi, could we please get a refill on our water""...  ""Excuse me, could I please get a refill on my water..."" ""Could you please refill my water.."" THREE times we had to ask for a refill for water..THREE times she said yes and never came back.

The spinach and artichoke dip is by far the best (try it with pita bread), and no other restaurant comes close to concocting a recipe as good.  This location is the #1 in the country, so the wait times can get very long, especially on the weekends and holidays. They do not do call aheads or reservations, so I would suggest coming early if you have a specific time you'd like to eat. With party's of four or more, this is a must.  I have a fav. server, who I always request. He gave me an inside scoop that things are changing because CPK was bought by a Corporation. Staff was cut in every area. When the restaurant is swamped, food may take longer to come out too. Less kitchen staff=longer wait on food.

457,Cat K.,"Honolulu, HI",65,68,61.0,2.0,2012-05-19,"This review is strictly for take out.   So I ordered online.  I don't know why I prefer to order my food online rather than speak to an actual person.  Oh wait, maybe because computers don't sass or speak to you like you're an idiot, kind of like one of the gals who was working the take out area when I picked up my order.   I ordered the roasted vegetable salad, without the romaine lettuce because the night before when I ordered the same salad at the Ala Moana CPK, it consisted almost entirely of lettuce and very little roasted vegetables.  I just wanted the roasted vegetables and avocado.  Apparently, I'm an idiot for checking off the online option that specifically says to hold the romaine lettuce.  ""What do you mean you don't want lettuce?!  It's a salad.""  I let her talk me into just taking the lettuce since it's packed separately from the roasted vegetables anyway ""so you can just add as much lettuce as you want to the vegetables.""  What if I just don't want lettuce?  It's not like I asked for a discount for ""no lettuce"". On a side note, I did come with one of those Don't-Open-Thank-You-Cards and received 10% off my order but I did not receive one for this order (I left a 10% tip because I'm still not sure what the etiquette is on take out, so I didn't really save any money).  However, the customer who picked up her pasta order right before me (pasta, sauce & cheese in three separate containers) received a thank you card.  I guess CPK Kahala just wasn't thankful for my particular order tonight.   I was going to let this whole experience slide because it's not like a cockroach ran out from under my food just as I was sticking my fork into it (yes, that really happened at a popular Hawaiian food joint on Kapahulu, and it wasn't Haili's), but I felt bad as I was driving home and you're not supposed to be made to feel bad when you leave a hugely corporate food joint like CPK.  I'm supposed to feel obligated to come back because they gave me yet another secret scratch off Don't-Open-Thank-You-Card, which is why I was patronizing their business for the 4th time in three days in the first place.

Critics, please note the time of that meal into consideration when you pick a place to sit and eat.       After 20 minutes our waitress ( who was very attentive ) broke it to us that our ticket was lost in the kitchen, followed  by the manager with sincere apologies.

Their take out also does more orders then CPK ala moana, Pearlridge and waikiki COMBINED.

Hubby did his famous ""surprise me"" tactic, and was presented with a cedar plank salmon and succotash.  I guarantee he never would have ordered that himself at CPK, but it was juicy and cooked to perfection.   We had a lovely time, but I'm still mourning the loss of my fave.  PLEASE BRING BACK THE MISO SALAD!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=220,3.24,3.67,3.67,3.088,3.498

They have a ""kids menu"" that includes a menu (ha) plus pages and pages of things for them to do - coloring, puzzles, etc. My daughter always gets the cheese pizza (comes with a drink). My husband and I usually share a chopped salad and then, depending on our appetite -- 1 or 2 pizzas. This week, we found that they redid their menu (!), so the thin crust pesto chicken was gone. Instead, we tried the roasted artichoke and spinach thin crust pizza. It had tons of garlic & was actually really good! We also tried the mushroom pizza (regular crust), which has now become my new favorite! We were stuffed! Took home a little more than half a pizza as leftovers. Another thing we usually get is a veggie pizza with the goat cheese option. (I think it's still on the menu?) The service is usually reasonable - pleasant, cheery, and usually very responsive. It's a very kid-friendly place, and I know several of my friends who bring their families here, too.

Although it appeared busy our waiter checked up on us and refilled our glasses with ice tea. My desert, the red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream put it over the top. My friend had the children's hot fudge sundae.

The ambiance, the food, the service.. all things are consistent. That has held true for many years until yesterday. I'm not sure what happened here. Maybe the stars weren't aligned, maybe our server was new. Who knows. It certainly wasn't busy so I can count that possibility out. Anyways, here is what happened. When we sat down, I had a question for our server. I told her the last time that we were here, I downloaded the Pizza Dough app on my iPhone which is supposed to get you a free small plate for registering. She told me that she would look it up for me to let me know what kind of offers I have and she also asks me for my check in code at this time. She took our order, and then told us she'd bring bread for us as well. When she walked by about ten minutes later, she reminded us that she would bring us some bread. Maybe she forgot, I don't know. Our entrees come out a short while later and I start to enjoy my pizza and she starts to enjoy her shrimp pasta. We receive our bread five minutes after the entrees come out. By this time (about 230p) the restaurant starts to empty out even more and the restaurant is almost empty . After we stop eating, we ask our server for boxes and it was an approximate wait time of fifteen minutes for her to bring us our boxed food, to drop off the check, and to pick it up after we slipped our card in the guest check holder. She never did tell us what offer we still have in regards to the Pizza Dough app. And I did not get the credit from that meal in my account. It was a sad day at the Pizza Kitchen for me. This one experience isn't going to stop me from coming because as I've said before, there's always been a high level of consistency. But hopefully the management will read this and realize that there might be something wrong with the phone app.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=200,3.52,3.51,3.51,2.604,3.5140000000000002
400,Jeff O.,"Honolulu, HI",18,8,,1.0,2013-07-26,"(If I could give zero stars.. . Or even negative 2!) You know I don't know why I keep trying to give their takeout a chance..? They NEVER get the order correct,  EVER!  I have reprimanded more temporary hired assistant's w/in the last 3 years than I have since I helped to open this first Kahala CPK back in 1988,90(?) when the menu was larger and thousands of customers came every day, basically the whole Oahu island came! Where we,  back then, got 98% of ALL orders right,  and those we didn't,  we corrected! Where Pantry had to make a warm Spinach salad topped w/ Quail eggs as the garnish and had a caramel or chocolate fudge ice cream sundae where we made the whipped cream! Nowadays the menu is smaller and the pantry, sauté and pizza stations are all smaller.  But it is sad to say that w/in the last few years the food has gotten worst and worst.  It doesn't matter that they try to revamp their menu, try different presentations, try to hire better staff... NONE of it is working! Their cooks don't care the food tastes like a bland uncaring attempt. Remember people aioli is mayonnaise! Presentation doesn't matter because I am only critiquing TakeOut though does include their food! And their order takers/waiters always ASSUME what the customer wants to order! Like they press the picture on the order screen of what they ""think"" they heard, or maybe they were thinking what they want for lunch or what they like to eat, not what the customer is actually ordering!?  I do believe my assistant, that he ordered what he wanted and then what I wanted for lunch. CPK got his selection right since there is no other item w/the words in its name in any other item on the menu. What I wanted is another story. I wanted the original Chopped Salad w/salami yet what I got was the gross bbq chopped chicken salad. (wth happened to the Chinese chicken salad? That was 10x better than this bbq cream salad!!) This salad is atrocious! It's like it was designed by a drunk person w/ no taste buds! Now why would the counter person think what my assistant ordered, the original chopped salad w/ salami,  diced chicken, garbanzo beans, diced tomatoes and their olive oil based dressing somehow could've been mistaken for this bbq cream chicken salad w/ the bland cream dressing, bbq sauce and cardboard chicken. BBQ sauce on lettuce is grossly disgusting then add in a bland cream dressing and now you have something created by a person born w/o taste buds!  I did not want the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad.  I wanted the Original Chopped Salad w/ salami and diced chicken. This frequent order taking mistake is why I will NEVER dine in. If a restaurant is unable to get the customers order correct for take out,  then there is only a minuscule chance that they'll get it right in a noisy sit down and wait atmosphere. Now the reason I am critical about this critique is that 9 out of 10 times at the take out counter,  they have gotten my order WRONG!! Having to send the order back while standing there and waiting while watching sit down patrons come and go pisses me off! (I have 12+years experience as a cook in places such as CPK all the way up to fine dining Roy's and Wolfgang Steakhouse so can only blame the cooks in the tasteless unseasoned food,  not in the mistaken order).  It's like the workers at CPK just don't care anymore. All they want is a paycheck. That this ""job"" is just a ""give me my tip/paycheck"" job and who cares about the customer,  which is sad because this Kahala store does at least a thousand less per day than when we first opened it!  The reason I am mad at my assistant is because I've always told him that,  ""you MUST check"" your order while you're 'at the window' because we live in an era where customer service has been measured and found wanting. Where young workers just don't care and have no honor or pride in what they do. I was mad because my assistant fell into that category of the careless in this one instance.  9 out of 10 times Kahala CPK will get your order wrong. They have come a long way,  going in the wrong direction and I strongly believe they are now the worst CPK on the island!  My last comment: CPK,  WTH is w/ all these sauces and dressings meant to cover up the ingredients of the dishes? Chicken should taste like chicken but doesn't because when it was cooked, the cook didn't care enough to season it w/a pinch of salt!

But when going here yesterday, many aspects seemed to have gone downhill.  After deciding rather last-minute, I celebrated my birthday here with my roommates. The wait wasn't horrible, but our waitress was! When seated, she came to our table and offered to take our drink order: ""Hi, want to get started with drinks? You're all too young...we have soda and water."" Lady. Two of my roommates are legal to drink. Don't assume. Luckily one of my roommates proved her wrong and ordered a beer, much to the waitress's surprise upon checking her ID. No apology, but took the order and walked off.  For what seemed like forever later, she came back with the beer and took our food order. The food arrived and it was pretty tasty. We ordered the BBQ chicken and California club pizza, and also a pasta (I believe chicken penne alfredo). When mentioning it was my birthday, the waitress said, ""Oh, we can embarrass her then?"". Normally I would have joked along, but she didn't say it in a friendly tone. She handed me the dessert menu, and my roommate asked for the check. She said, ""she hasn't ordered her dessert yet"",  which confused us as she made it seem as if the dessert was my birthday treat. She walked away, but we asked another waitress for clarification. You get a free birthday sundae, but anything from the dessert menu costs. Couldn't our waitress have said that in the first place!? The birthday sundae came, and it was a decent size! Vanilla ice cream with chocolate fudge sauce and some chocolate chips. Really gooey, delicious, and perfect for a sweet tooth like myself. Came with a maraschino cherry and candle. Cute. Finally getting our check, it wasn't separated when we asked prior. Our waitress would continually stop by our table momentarily and walk away before we had the chance to talk to her, so we didn't bother waiting for her to return to separate our checks.

This used to be my go-to CPK location...until today. I came with a friend to grab a meal before a movie, 3 hours later. They seated us very quickly for a Sunday afternoon which left us brainstorming how we could kill time after our meal before the movie. After two hours in the restaurant, we no longer have that quagmire.  After being seated, we waited 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence. A waiter, not our own, noticed we were being neglected and came over to help us. We ordered our entrees and proceeded to wait 40 minutes for our food. My chicken/pasta dish arrived barely warm and I waited another 10 minutes before our waitress finally noticed the barely touched food in front of me. She offered to have the kitchen re-warm it and took it back.  Wait another 15 minutes, my entree is returned to me, replated but now overcooked from being rewarmed. Give the waitress some more time to notice my barely touched food, and they finally offer to remake my order. Finally, an hour and a half after arriving I received an edible, albeit mediocre entree. After finishing, we wait another 15 minutes for our waitress to box our food and bring the check. I wanted to pay with cash, simply because I didn't want to wait for her to run my card but I needed all the cash I had, so we were forced to wait while she took another 10 minutes to run our cards.  On top of all of that, we had to repeatedly ask for bread, butter, and refills of our water. Our waitress was frazzled and we felt like an inconvenience to the restaurant. Funny thing, the restaurant wasn't even full. It was probably at half capacity when we arrived.  Although the manager checked on us to ask things were okay after my entree fiasco, we did not receive an apology.  No discount. No comp. Never again CPK Kahala.  I've never been disappointed at a CPK until today.

Helpful hints to the management:  Employees should have a better way to get orders from the kitchen.  Add a dedicated food runner for take out (if there is already one, increase the staff).  Have a beverage station nearby instead of in the back.  Have a stantion that separates the order and pick up lines so they dont blend into one long line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=320,3.16,3.35,3.35,2.9240000000000004,3.274

I spoke to a representative, who wasn't even apologetic, and who transferred me to the take out extension.  Aaaaaand waited 20 minutes on hold.

I mean, why do you still care about the food, its been contaminated!   All the family members should leave quickly so we don't have to endure the sight and smell.  I just couldn't believe how slow the manager reacted or didn't react.  The table next to them left with disgust. My complaint to this is, the way the crew clean the area was not sufficient.  They quickly took away the plates, moved the chairs and tables to make room to accommodate more guests, since its a busy Saturday night.  I saw how they ""clean"" the area, didn't disinfect the tables, booths, and chairs.  They should of clean the contaminated area and not use the tables and clean it thoroughly after the restaurant closed.  This shows how management is only thinking about $$ than the well being of the patrons. I made a statement to the waiter and the waiter send the rude manager over to me.  He assured me that the ""red bucket"" did the cleaning and killed all the germs. Well, like I told him, the red bucket don't mean anything if you just put it on the table. From my observation, the area was still contaminated with bacterias.  He didn't apologized for what I went through.  Just glad I saw everything and not my kids or their cousins, or else we might of had a bad chain reaction.

159,Tracy K.,"Honolulu, HI",635,157,1488.0,5.0,2014-01-06,"CPK is on that ""Top 5"" list of eateries in my mind when you need a go-to place to catch up with friends. And because I have a bunch of girlfriends that 1) love to eat and 2) love to catch up WHILE eating, it's nice to have a quick place to blurt out. The convo usually goes a little something like this: (text message) ""Hey Trace! I miss you! Let's get together soon!"" ""Sure! You choose the place and I'm there!"" ""I'll eat anywhere as long as I get to see you!"" ""Same here. I'm down for anything. What about ____?"" Now this girl-to-girl conversation can bounce back and forth a few more thumb smashings until someone throws out a restaurant name. And while there are a TON of new eateries that grace the island scene, not all fit between that magic combo of good selection, comfortable price point, and convenience.  CPK is my fall back restaurant, any day. Any time.  I've loved their food since I was a little girl, and especially when I was in high school watching my older sister hang out with her cool chef friends getting free food. You can probably name a fun time in your life that happened at a CPK restaurant: a birthday, a surprise party, a big secret you had to tell your best friend...actually, I've had all three! Recently, CPK has revamped their menu to attract a healthier crowd with smaller bites, fresher veggie ingredients on their pizzas, and serving bread with oil and herbs instead of butter packets. But let me break it down DJ Tracy stylez how I like to rock the CPK turntables (scratching the 1s and 2s): 1. SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP. Classic. The CPK recipe book unveils the secret behind the dipping magic created by approx two dozen ingredients including, (get this), tabasco. 2. Avocado Eggrolls. The name screams a 2, but the taste is a 10. What they fail to mention is that there is Bacon. Turkey. Cheese. INSIDE these rolls. AND they come with two dipping sauces in herb ranch and a spicy ranchito sauce. Fireworks in your mouth. For entrees, you can go with their BBQ chicken pizza, cobb salad, spinach asparagus pasta with salmon, or any of the few dozen other menu selections. I've taken a liking to the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza.  Oh, oh. And don't forget to ask for CHOLULA hot sauce. And more cheese (boy do I love cheese). My favorite part of every meal is dessert. And CPK got you covered with their famous Chocolate Souffle: a warm, oozing disc of molten chocolate goodness that kisses your lips with a side of rich Haagen Daaz vanilla bean ice cream. Oh lord.... Haven't convinced you yet? Why not treat yourself to a Red Velvet Cake? Or perhaps their newer desserts like the Salted Caramel Pudding or Fresh Fruits with Vanilla Sabayon? Seasonally, CPK will offer various menu items like the Butter Cake with Fresh Strawberries and whipped cream on top. Now THAT is heaven in your mouth.  And most recently, the fiance and I tried their Ace Hard Pear Cider that tasted like Jolly Rancher candy if they made it in pear flavor. I also like to wash down my meal with peach iced tea if I'm going alcohol-free.  Whatever the occasion, whatever the selection, CPK is guaranteed to win you over with their consistent customer service and classic ingredients that won't break the budget.  Hail to the CPK!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=120,2.96,3.25,3.25,3.3160000000000003,3.134

I feel like the products used on their pizzas here are much better than other places also! They also offer much more unique pizzas you can see on their menu different ones to fit your taste buds my favorite is the artichoke with Alfredo sauce, chicken, garlic, and Alfredo hearts! So delicious but it will definitely make your breath smell like garlic for a few days lol ;) Helps keep the vampires away! Now the Cesar salad here is AWESOME! I recommend it with the grilled chicken or salmon if you like salmon and want a healthier option! Cesar salad is by far my favorite and their croutons are homemade which makes their Cesar salad over the top! I could eat it everyday if I could! I cannot wait to try more of their different pizzas during my time on the island! My husband had their arugula quinoa salad and he couldn't stop raving about it!

The salad has a little to many red onions for my liking since I'm not a big onion fan. Be prepared to have a piece of gum afterwards! As for pizza, I lean towards the Margherita pizza because it has cheese AND tomatoes which are my to favorite.  (This is what I order when I'm craving junk food or when I'm craving a tomato sauce). The crust is thin and crunchy and has just the right amount of chewyness. As a starter, I love to have the avocado club rolls. It has big chunks of avocado, bacon, and cheese inside all deep friend (I believe) with two sauce choices. I'm drooling just typing about this! I love that they started their rewards card.

This makes the overall review a bit skewed toward the negative side, so I thought I'd just drop a line on the good time I almost always have here. But at this cpk specifically.  There's something about the kahala branch of this chain that is like your cool cousins from the suburbs that have a lake house & awesome family compared to the other cousins you have that you were forced to play with sometimes during holidays that were into that weird religion and put way too much mayo on sandwiches and also liked BOTH anchovies AND pineapple pizza.  anyway yeah this cpk is ALWAYS banging.

I wasn't angry at all cause late food is a dumb as hell reason to get upset over ESPECIALLY when a place is busy + it was handled so professionally. No excuses, just that's what happened.

We walked around Macy's for a bit went into the stationary store, all with in the area that the host said the receiver would reach. Well it came upon the 1hr marker and still no call on the reciver. So we decided to head back to CPK. Now we are hitting the 1.15 marker and we notice a new customer getting seated before us but it was only 2 of them so we figures that is the reason. So we go up to the host and ask how much longer. He was trying to find our name on the 3 sheets in front of him. Then he said your next. So we sat at the waiting area right next to CPK. Then we notice that another couple gets seated before us not 5 minutes after the host said we were next and to top it off they were seated at a booth that can seat 4. So we head up and complain about it and the girl that was standing next to host said ""well we were calling you"" with attitude. Um excuse me but the receiver never buzzed, and plus we were sitting no more than 20ft from you. I would of rather you told us that you made a mistake and over looked our name instead of saying you called us and actually didn't.  Ala moana is twice as busy on the weekends and not once has this happened to us.  Word of advise from one host to another. Be aware of your surroundings look up from the paper in front of you. Especially I'd someone has already complained. Because again we were sitting no more than 20ft from you when you said we were next.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=280,3.6,3.37,3.37,2.8280000000000003,3.462

Recently it has been renovated to add more seats and tables. Also the decor looks a lot better than before. Great job guys! For the food, it seems that recently the food have gone up in quality. The free bread is smaller but the taste is way better than before. Nice and hard crust, really soft and tasty inside. It comes with this olive oil with herbs in it (not sure the details). My personal favorites are the original BBQ chicken pizza and the salad. Such great taste of the BBQ sauce and chicken mixed into these simple recipes. The salad goes really well with avocado and the pizza is really good with honey wheat dough. Recommends!!! The butter cake is amazing!

322,Cindy S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,2.0,2014-09-07,"I don't really like writing bad reviews for places; especially not for places that I visit fairly often. The two stars I'm giving is because I really do like the food that California Pizza Kitchen offers. However, my past few visits have been really poor in the service department. I get that they just renovated to add more tables, which seriously cuts down on the wait time, but perhaps they should hire more servers? Or faster servers? Lately it feels like there's just a general oversight with the service, like we have to ask for everything.. All the way down to water refills. Water refills are pretty basic, right?  Today's visit was pretty bad. Bad enough that it compelled me to write this review. Here's what happened: We got there, got our waters, put in drink orders and went to wash our hands. Waited to place our orders for a bit, which.. It's fine, they're busy, I get it. Then we get the appetizers and the lettuce wraps were really great. They came with this really strong tasting ginger sauce, though, that kind of overpowered the dish and nobody really used any of it. Fast forward to where the server is clearing the plates away: I got a saucer of this stuff dumped onto me. A full saucer, since we barely used any of it. The server didn't even notice at first, not until we mentioned it to him. This wasn't a tiny spill, mind you, it was all in my hair and my sweater and pants. Once they realized the mistake they apologized, which to be honest is better service than another restaurant I've been to with the same incident. (I'm seriously a magnet for this, no idea why.) The manager came out to apologize and offered to have my clothes laundered, which was nice of him, but he seemed really aloof.  Sadly, though, even after that happened and the tables around us cleared out, there was no speedier or attentive service. I don't know if the waiter was embarrassed to come back to our table, but we STILL had to ask for refills on water and drinks. It even got to the point that we were clearing our finished dishes to another table to make room on ours. Then when the check came, they hadn't comped or discounted anything. I really hate the ""complain and you shall receive"" mentality that most people have, but seriously. That was something I could have MAJORLY complained about, and I've had soup comped at that location because it was served to me at room temperature, not because I was wearing it. The servers ended up bringing out a towel and club soda for me to wipe down my clothes, and they were nice, but I kind of feel like because I'm quiet and didn't make a scene, (not my style. Plus, I work in retail, so I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of it), that the manager didn't pursue the whole buttering-up-angry-customer route. Meh. That's pretty much how I felt after this visit: Meh. tldr; Food dropped on me, no comps, had to ask for refills, generally not attentive service = sad Cindy. Sad enough that I might not be visiting this location for a while. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=400,3.52,3.39,3.39,2.7600000000000007,3.442

CPK is probably one of the very few spots, that is consistently great every time you visit. Sure there is often a bit of a wait, unless you're lucky, but once you're seated you are in the zone. The CPK crew always, always, always seem to have their game faces on which is fantastic because they bring it -- customer service, friendliness, and happiness all the time! You really get the team effort vibe from the crew.  From appetizers, salads, pizza and pasta -- CPK has a huge variety and since this is my first review but surely not my first visit, I can say I've tried a bunch of different items on the menu. All of them are good! Crazy, right? My favorites include: spinach dip with blue chips, lettuce wraps, grilled veggie or original chopped salad, and tortilla soup (add a dash of hot sauce)! The regular pizza is good too, but I love those thin crusted pizzas which is like yummy goodness on a cracker thin crust. I enjoy the pasta options too although I can't say I have a favorite.   Whatever you choose, be SURE you leave some room for dessert because you'll be seeing them pass your table throughout your meal and you'll be drooling for something sweet like the key lime pie, butter cake and oh, salted caramel pudding!  And of course, how could I possibly forget the cocktails!? Goodness, CPK has almost any type of refreshment you could want - a huge selection of wine, beers, interesting cocktails and more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140,3.32,3.28,3.484,3.572,3.2960000000000003

I have eaten at many of these restaurants over the years.  I used to really enjoy them and my wife liked this chain so we would go every once in a while.   But recently, the taste of the pizza has changed for me....either they use different ingredients, or the sauce is different, but my Thai chicken pizza is not the same.  How do I know this....well this is my go to order every time I come here.  It is possible that the formula for the islands is different than the mainland (wouldn't be the first time),but not sure. I should just order what my bro orders...the Sicilian pizza....I usually end up eating part of his anyway. I also miss the days of two in a bowl soup with potato leek and tortilla soup....that was so good.  My wife also misses the BLT pizza and the duck pizza as well....such a bummer. Anyway...I know what I am going to order next time I am here....salted caramel pudding.  This is caramel pudding, black cocoa cookie crumbs, house made whipped cream, caramel sauce and natural flaked sea salt.

136,Crissy K.,"Honolulu, HI",392,394,234.0,4.0,2014-11-03,"According to their website (and other sources), the Kahala restaurant is the busiest CPK in the world. If you've ever seen the dozens of people lining the hall outside, you don't doubt this statistic. So minus one star for the inability to make a spur-of-the-moment group lunch date, but all the positives about this location far outweigh that one downside! CPK Kahala recently underwent a pretty expensive renovation. At first glance, it seems like they just swapped out some furniture and moved the check-in counter . . . but then you go inside, and you realize it goes waaaaaay back, and the dining area is actually now very long. The restrooms are well-lit and neat, too. And about half of the wall art seems to be local, which is a nice touch! Oh, and in case you missed having the grated parmesan and dried pepper shakers already at your table, those are back now, too: You don't have to ask for them anymore. The service at this location was already excellent, but it seems as though the staff has recently undergone some additional training, as even more staff stop what they're doing to thank you for your patronage while you're on your way out.  Another cool aspect of the Kahala restaurant is the convenience of their takeout. As with any other CPK, you can place your order online, but the extra here is that you can pick up your order without having to go into the restaurant proper, as the takeout counter interface is outside. The Kahala location's takeout is also reported to be the busiest of their takeout counters in the country. Again, if you've ever seen the line of people picking up their orders, you don't even question this. One of my favorite takeout items: catering-sized salads, especially the Moroccan chicken salad. Pricey, yes, but also impressive in size, appearance and quality of ingredients.  In terms of menu selection, CPK is CPK. The chain is constantly adjusting (mostly raising) prices and changing around their food items, but there are so many good-to-great choices, I never get tired of it.

But this California pizza kitchen has been a major go to place for my family and friends since I was much much younger. they have expanded their dining area in the back, moved into the hallway in the front, and re-did everything that I knew visually about the restaurant... And yet I'll keep going back. Their prices have inflated over the years, as to be expected.  The staffing at CPK is wonderful. Merle has been one of my favorites as long as I can remember, in fact I got a welcoming hug from her the other day when I haven't seen her for a while. There are many familiar faces there which makes this major restaurant chain feel like a local stop for me.  Probably mostly because it is a chain, that the food is very consistent. You know exactly what you're getting when you order, and if it does not meet your standards, they will replace it and take care of it and make sure that you leave full and happy. Our favorites there include: the spinach artichoke dip (of course) which has been copied over and over and over but never made as good, the margarita pizza (sometimes I like to add mushrooms, But most of the time I like the simplicity of it), and then anyone of their desserts will do just fine. Most of their pizzas are pretty spot on, although we do miss some of our old favorites like the rosemary chicken potato, the original Peking duck, but we have let our tastes adjust to the ever-changing menu.

I don't know what it is, but people in Hawaii are seriously addicted to CPK. When I was in high school, it was the Chinese chicken salad. I just had to have it! What's great is they keep reinventing the menu, while keeping the mainstay items like that salad.  My kids will consistently choose CPK when asked where they want to eat. Is it the chocolate milk that comes with the kids meal? Is it the free birthday dessert? Is it the coloring page and crayons? Or maybe just all our good memories at this ever popular establishment. We will keep CPK in business for a loooooong time. You're welcome!  My fave orders now are: quinoa arugala salad, roasted vegetable salad, Moroccan chicken salad, two in a bowl soup (smashed pea and barley / tortilla soup).

After calling Ala Moana and finding out they had a 50 minute wait and CPK does not take reservations or ""Call-ins"" I was turned off and found myself at Kahala Mall with a 30 minute wait that really turned out to be only 25 minutes! Luckily, this location, too is in mall so it helps to walk around and kill time. Our enthusiastic waiter seated us and wow was he just having a great evening or is he always this happy?! Great service! Keep in mind, I haven't been to a CPK in over a year so I was impressed with the renovations such as their dress attire, the atmosphere and most of all the menu!...which seemed to be more limited than I remember or maybe they changed the layout? Our waiter promptly got us waters and bread for starters. This bread is much better than their previous! Warm with oil dipping sauce, delicious! And we got free seconds. Anyways, I ordered the Garlic pasta w/ Shrimp (4$ add-on) and also ordered the Tiramisu for dessert. The food was, okay. My partner finished all his food and was left a little hungry so I wouldn't say the portions are large but the dessert was a good size for sharing. I really liked the fact that they leave the Parmesan shaker at the table, which allows you to add Parmesan as you eat and to your desire! Our water was always refilled and our waiter checked up on us appropriately! Literally the service makes it 4 stars! Dinner for two came out to 43$ before tip so I pretty much handed over the gift card + cash. It was a good experience so I am glad I had a gift card but CPK is not the top of my list for pasta.

However, when you walk inside, the place is huge. It extends way back with a lot of seats.  I had lunch here yesterday with the hubby. Everything was great, from the food to the service. We went around 2:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was busy but not full. We got seated right away. The host was nice and joked around with us. It was raining but he made a joke about looking at the sunny weather through the glass windows. We waited for about 5 minutes before the server came. He apologized right away for the wait, which wasn't a problem because he was busy from what I noticed. For some reason, all their name tags are written in chalk. The first letter of his name was smudged. I only made out the EN, the last letters of his name. It was either Ben, Gen or Ken. He confirmed that his name was Ben. He was awesome, one of the better servers I had in a while. He checked on us frequently, kept the glasses full and cracked a few jokes. What I noticed about this place was that the servers are happy. Everyone in the front of the house was smiling and having fun. I looked at all the servers around me and they were all smiling and joking around with the customers and their co-workers. I've never been to a restaurant where all the servers were genuinely smiling. I eat out quite frequently, at least 3-4 times a week. When we were leaving, at least 4 employees thanked us for visiting. Hmmm, it makes me wonder what management is doing at this place that's keeping their workers happy. Whatever it is, it's working. This was my first time at this location. I usually go to the one at Ala Moana or Pearlridge. This location definitely has the better service. It's not to say that the other locations give bad service, because they don't. They just don't seem to smile and are always just rushing around. The food here also came out relatively fast. I would say 10-15 minutes after we ordered, the entrees were out. I had to get my favorite salad, the Thai Crunch salad with avocado. It was spectacular as always. I've never tasted a better salad. The taste of the food from their different locations are pretty consistent. I order this salad no matter what CPK location I'm at and it always tastes the same. Instead of pizza today, we opted for a pasta. I wanted to try the pesto penne with shrimp and chicken. It was good but I like my flavoring a little stronger. For dessert, we tried the butter cake with ice cream. This dish was oh so good. It's served warm and there's some kind of syrup that's baked into the cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140,3.8,3.32,3.484,3.4760000000000004,3.512

My in-laws brought us here tonight, because it was my daughters 11th birthday and she wanted to go. We started off with a 30 minute wait for seats, they were quite busy so it's perfectly understandable for a six top, not too bad. 1. The food: After we were seated, our server was right on it and had drinks on the way immediately. After we ordered, bread was brought to us while we waited, the food came out very quickly, about 15 minutes. Everything was quite good, on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give them a solid 7. The portions were enough, but not overly generous. Again, well done CPK.  2. Service: In a word, Terrific! Our server was Chris, and he was great. He completely took care of us. As I said, my wife and I have some experience in this. We've dined in virtually all of the finest restaurants in Honolulu and experienced the full range of service. Chris did better than some fine dining waiters, with considerably less assistance. Awesome job Chris, and Thank You! A solid 10! 3. Atmosphere: This is where they lose me. In a word LOUD. I've never been a fan of the open kitchen, spiffy cafeteria format. I don't get the allure of having to yell to speak to the person sitting next to me, with loud music piped in as a bonus. I enjoy a good rock concert, just not when I'm having dinner with the family. Some of this has to do with the choice of building materials, all hard surfaces, nothing to absorb the sound, as well as the normal kitchen noise. A McDonalds is quieter.

The décor is decidedly warmer and not so ""sterile"" looking plus they've expanded their seating area into the mall.   As a Pizza Dough rewards member, I received an offer for $10 discount with $40 or more purchase.  Once seated, I informed our waitress, Jessica, of my check-in number and discount offer.  Jessica was friendly and top-notch efficient.  From the time she greeted us to presenting the bill, she checked with us several times and was never intrusive.  She refilled our iced teas without us even asking, made sure that our food came out on time and that the flavors were pleasing.   So, what did we order? Well, we're sort of creatures of habit so we happily ordered a full-sized Cobb salad and a Wild Mushroom Pizza. As we dined, I noticed the placard featuring CPK's Summer Strawberry beverages and desserts.  My eyes fixated on the Strawberry Shortcake while I munched on the delicious thin-crust pizza.  As we were finishing our meal, Jessica noted that we were just $5 away from spending $40 and we'd miss out on the discount if we didn't order anything more.  Well, we weren't going to let that happen so we ordered the Strawberry Shortcake à la mode.  We were quite full from sharing that huge salad and pizza but, the dessert just pushed us into food coma.  The light biscuit was complimented with fresh strawberry slices in syrup and topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream along with crystallized lemon zest.  That dessert didn't last very long on our table as we dove into it with wild abandon.   CPK Kahala didn't disappoint as we had received wonderful service, great flavors and good value.  Granted, this location doesn't have any scenic views to speak of like at its Ala Moana site.

There is something about CPK Kahala that puts me at ease knowing the service and the quality of their food will be both consistent and pleasing!  My two sons and I decided that we would head to Kahala Mall for dinner and some shopping. The heat has been so unbearable so I was so happy to accommodate their request! We got to the mall at around 6:45 p.m. the waiting area of CPK looked a bit crowded so we decided to hold off eating for another half hour or so and check back again. We were happy to find that waiting a bit was the best decision. We put in our name and was seated within 10-12 minutes. YAY!  Our server was a friendly young local guy. He was efficient, smart and very accommodating. We ordered our food and he quickly brought out our drinks and bread. He was  super busy managing his other tables but always seemed to come right back to us to see if we needed anything or think ahead of what we would need. Extra napkins? check.; more water... check, kids need a water cup too.... check. Not only was our server awesome, but his manager walked around filling up iced tea, soda, and water throughout the restaurant. Love management who don't mind working hard. Awesome example.  We ordered our favorites:  avocado egg rolls, kids meal in mac n cheese and alfredo, bbq chop salad with avocados. We were happy campers! Food came out hot and fresh and...... quickly! We were in and out of CPK in 40 minutes eating what seemed at leisure.  I recommend this CPK location. Best one in Hawaii and definitely the best one I've been to period.

112,Travis H.,"Sarasota, FL",50,114,355.0,4.0,2015-07-08,"Let me start off by saying that this location is by far the best of the ""big 3"" (Ala Moana, Waikiki, and Kahala). I've tried Waikiki on three separate occasions since it's a bit more convenient, but it's been just awful on all three attempts. Ala Moana isn't bad, but the wait to be seated is often 45mins minimum. That's not their fault, but to eat the same thing, I'd prefer the 5-10 minute wait time at Kahala.  Enough negatives! On to the review. This is a go to spot for my wife and I. You'll be seated rather quickly more often than not. The food has always been fantastic. Out of the multiple times (we come here a lot) we've been here, our food has never been brought to us incorrectly. Not one mistake, ever. That's pretty darn consistent. The most recent trip here was on July 4th as we decided to pass on the madness of the Waikiki fireworks for a quiet dinner instead. I ordered the original BBQ chicken pizza with bacon, and my wife ordered her favorite, the five cheese with fresh tomato (add chicken of course). Both pizzas were delicious (see pictures below), and of course they were prepared properly.  The only issue I have is that the staff is hit or miss. Some of the waiters/waitresses are incredible, but other times you'll be met with someone who is clearly overwhelmed and/or not wanting to be there. That's such a disappointment when you're having dinner and the waiter is disinterested in helping you. All things considered, it's one of the better CPK's around. It's worth the extra few miles to drive, trust me!  PS: Sign up for their pizza dough rewards program.

It's just a chain, right? Wrong. So wrong.  This particular CPK is basically my kitchen away from home.

Sure there are times when our server is a little slower but this is also the busiest CPK in the entire corporation so that makes sense. There is a busboy or runner I'm not sure what his exact title is but he is always so attentive and can tell when I need something even if he is across the room.  Also, I am here most of the time with children. This is my go to place if I am watching children or if I'm meeting friends who have children. Kids love it here and you can't beat the price. The kids meals always come out really quickly so that they have something to do and they are eating. The fact that you can get a sundae for the kids for $.99 is pretty magical too.

When we first got there, the line was very long.  We totally understand that CPK usually takes a while for seating-especially because we requested a booth-we always do.  However, when our pager finally went off and we followed a waiter into CPK, we were seated at a table.  My family never gets irritated about these minor issues.  But we have been waiting almost an hour and a half for our booth, and could clearly see three open.  The waiter apologized when we told him what we requested, and brought us to the back.  He started to put down the menus and waited for us to get seated.  At another table!  We told him once more we requested a booth.  He then took us to the front and told us to wait a couple more minutes on the little seating area inside.  We were tired and hungry, and so this was quite annoying.  As we waited, three more families got seated inside the booths we were supposed to have.  One of my family members talked to the waiter, and he talked to the manager.  The waiter told him that we had demanded to be seated right away so that's why he seated us at a table-not true.  We waited almost two hours for the table.  We didn't care anymore and sat at the half booth the manager sat us in-we were just hungry.  He brought us an appetizer as an apology.  Even though we waited way longer then we were supposed to, the manager was very nice and understanding, and was good at calming us down.  I really did appreciate his gesture and want to thank him for that.  We will be coming back here, but I will remember this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=280,3.68,3.53,3.476,3.2760000000000007,3.5900000000000003

209,Daisy V.,"Honolulu, HI",3,369,,2.0,2015-08-09,"We waited 15, 20 minutes before a server came to see us.  We weren't in her section, but she saw us looking irritated and noted our glances around the restaurant looking for wait help, she she came to our table to check in, then promised she would find the person.  Few seconds later, she returned, apologized, and stated that she would serve us. She was on point the whole time, fast, courteous, refilling water, getting us the bread and butter quickly (given that we were already hungry and annoyed when she first engaged us), and checking in with other things, on a regular basis.  Efficient service, though she was obviously slammed. We tipped well, but it was clear that she was on her own, alone with her good work ethic--and that whatever other server who was supposed to be working that section, was out to lunch. Yet:  why didn't a manager figure out how to handle this, rather than her?  She did apologize and say the restaurant was short staffed; she did very professional work, trying not to diss anyone in particular or make the establishment look bad, though we had been ready to walk out, if she didn't come along.   Management seems to be missing here--should be able to handle something as basic as being 1-2 people short of the schedule, during peak lunch time. Anyways, about the food... I had simple stuff, hummus and pita with a large bowl of tortilla soup.  It was the living definition of blah.  Pita was not toasted but micro-waved; I don't expect it crispy but do expect something beyond what I could do at home with my super-limited culinary skills.  Hummus was competently made though bland, with not enough chives/green onions sprinkled around the plate, to make it savory or interesting. Tortilla soup was kind of flat, with little spice in it, or interesting chopped veggies.  It tasted, frankly, canned. I'm not sure if these are complaints for the particular CPK branch or the whole chain/franchise.  When did this food become so uninspired and not fresh tasting?  Could it be because they have such a lock on the location--one of the few consistent food places in this mall where you can sit and eat and have a supposedly ""nice"" meal--that they simply don't care?  Or what the larger chain is poorly managed, from wait help to the cooking line?  They are truly just maintaining and cruising off the goodwill of a yuppie/middle-class professional population that seems not to give a shit. My friend and I could've bought the same meal from Whole Foods' refrigerated prepared foods sections, tossed it into the microwave, and the taste and textures would've been the same.

The shrimp fettuccine is also good, but would be better with less lemon. Just my opinion. The servers are friendly and pleasant. Sometimes I order at the takeout counter if I need to get home.  Once, though, they gave me a deli sandwich when I ordered the turkey club.  And they forgot to give me bread with my soup.  I didn't discover it until I got home, which was too late.  Well, they WERE very busy.  Next time I will check when I pick it up. 1/28/16 Update:  I gave them their 5th star.  Lately the take out counter employees have been double checking the order as they give it to customers and taking more, even when very busy.  Tonight they gave me a copy of the new menu and pointed out some items that were popular.  Thanks, guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=220,3.76,3.59,3.46,3.7,3.658

We were told the wait would only be about 30 minutes, but we ended up waiting almost an hour.  However, what made up for the long wait was our really friendly and personable waitress (I think her name was Casey?). We ordered right away and were glad to be able to chow down on some bread immediately! My husband ordered the kung pau spaghetti with chicken, I ordered the tomato basil pasta (which wasn't on the menu but our waitress recommended it when I asked if they had any simple tomato sauce pastas), and our daughter had the pasta with tomato sauce from the kid's menu. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait long for our food! Everything was piping hot and delicious!  We were too full for dessert but ordered a slice of key lime pie to-go so that we could take advantage of the $10 off of $40 (just a heads-up, if you ever go during one of these promos, the $40 is for food only! My husband had ordered a long island iced tea and that didn't count towards the $40 so that's why we had to order dessert).

This is the highest grossing location in the nation and I don't wonder why.  In the wake of a reimagined menu rolled out just a few days ago, I tried their new Farmers Market soup. This was an incredibly hearty, thick and savory roasted squash soup with a medley of market vegetables such as corn and zucchini, with a touch of cream and a drizzle of olive oil. Add some ground black pepper you will absolutely love this satisfying soup. A hearty cup is 4.99 but a bowl which is more than twice the size of the cup is 6.99. The soup was divine to the last drop, and just as I was recovering from my Farmers Market soup withdrawal, the Morrocan spiced chicken salad arrived. The dish is a truly delightful and uncommon salad made with roasted butternut squash (can you tell I love butternut squash?), avocado, dates, cranberries, beets, red peppers and chopped egg tossed in a yummy housemade champagne vinaigrette dressing which is actually best on the side. The full sized portion is pricey, however, at 17.29. I'm glad I stopped by while I was in the area to try some of their new items.

I really enjoy going to this location (I've been to Kahala, Pearlridge and The Ala Moana locations) and I'd have to say that the Kahala location is my favorite!! First of all it brings back so many good memories of my High School days, which feels like a million years ago. It's got a great spot at the mall and I never have a problem finding parking. The staff is always friendly even when it's super busy and the food is ALWAYS delicious!!  My only complaint is that I don't really understand how the CPK dough rewards works and the servers rarely ask me if I have a rewards card and I'm usually so full that I forget, just a suggestion to the staff... Ask your customers if they have a reward card or if they'd like to sign up for one.  I do have to admit that I was a little disappointed with my dessert the last time that I went to Kahala CPK, I had the chocolate cake with ice cream and the cake was really dry luckily my daughter didn't mind and she polished off the cake and I happily ate the ice cream. I really want to try the butter cake the next time and I hope that it's not dry. I'll have to go there just for dessert because I'm usually way too full to have dessert.

California Pizza Kitchen is located in Kahala Mall, closer to Macy's Men Store.  There is ample parking all around the mall.  The restaurant has a section that is seated into the mall area, a larger section that includes the bar area and a view of the parking lot, and a smaller back area.  Each section has a combination of booths and tables. We were here for dinner on a Monday night.  It was about 5:30 pm and we had a short 10 minute wait for a table.  We were seated in the newer section in the back.  I believe that it used to be Yummy's.  The lighting in the area is very dark.  It may be good for like really romantic dates, but for family dinner, it was wrong.  The kids needed to break out the flashlight app on their phones so I could see the menu.  The track lightning isn't even aimed at the tables.  Add to that, my chair was off balance.  Our waited switched out my chair, but noting could be done about the lighting.  Whatever!  I was hungry! Our waiter seemed distracted, but he was genuinely nice.  He listened when the youngest ordered and didn't judge her on her order (she likes things on the side).  Hubby ordered chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps (to share) and a BBQ pizza (for himself).  Middle child was sad because they took the chicken caesar sandwich off the menu.  She opted for the Mac'n Cheese Bites and a chicken caesar salad.  I wanted to try something new and went for Thai pizza.  We asked for our free bread and settled in for good conversation while we waited for our food. Our lettuce wraps came out first.  With 4 of us, we quickly went thru the lettuce.  Our waiter had to grab us more.  The wait was a little long for the lettuce, over 5 minutes.  Not sure if he forgot or of the kitchen was backed up.  The kids pizza came out next.  It must've been excellent because that was gone before the rest of us got our food.  My Thai pizza was very good!  The bran sprouts, peanut sauce, carrots, and cilantro made a task pizza!  The BBQ pizza is always excellent!  The caesar salad was tasty and had a lot of cheese!   We didn't really stay for dessert because the lightning was giving me a low grade headache.  I bribed the family with dessert in the mall. The price for our food, the quality, and the service made this a fun night for us to just hang out.  Maybe next time, I'll just ask to be seated not in the back?  Or go during the day when there is more sun?   (4)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=100,3.72,3.6,3.48,3.3440000000000003,3.6480000000000006

The salad includes romaine, fresh avocado, grilled peppers, asparagus, corn, eggplant, and a bunch of other veggies tossed together with a balsamic dijon dressing. It's perfect. You can add chicken or Salmon. I would definitely choose the salmon. The chicken seemed so small and a bit dry, but the salmon never disappoints. My dad got the Margherita pizza which looked amazing! Too bad i'm not eating carbs right now.  Also, their mac and cheese (add bacon) is a must have when I go with my friends. It's delicious! The only reason for the docked star is because our waitor had absolutely no personality. I think he probably only said  about 5 words and that's when we were ordering.

It's been awhile since I've eaten at the Kahala Mall CPK, and I was surprised when I saw that they extended the outdoor mall seating further out into the walk way area of the mall. So smart of them to enlarge the restaurant, because this restaurant really has a very strong following, and they really crank over here! Last night I was jonesing for some lettuce wraps, so I called the gf to see if she wanted to go to CPK to eat. Lucky for me, she is always down, so off we went to Kahala Mall. Upon arriving at the restaurant, the place was packed! We walked up to the hostess & asked her if we could get a table. Lucky for us, we were able to secure a table for two.........but the only catch for this table was that it was under an A/C vent, so she told us it could get rather cold. For me, I hate the cold........but the gf likes the cold, so we took the table. I guess no can complain if you don't have to wait to eat yeah? Upon getting seated, the waiter came by & dropped off menus and water. Upon scanning the menu, we ordered the following grindz last night - 1 For Appetizers - Shrimp Lettuce Wraps ($12.49) 2. Thai Crunch Salad - half order ($11.59) 3. Cedar Plank Salmon ($19.99) 4. Ice Tea ($2.99) What can I say about the grindages? I love the lettuce wraps! CPK offers the lettuce wraps in 1. Chicken 2. Shrimp 3. Chicken & Shrimp Since the gf doesn't do chicken, we just got the plain shrimp, and I must say.........whatever you decide, you cannot go wrong! The lettuce wraps come with Shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts, & scallions tossed in a spicy ginger soy sauce. For my entree, I got the Thai Crunch Salad (1/2 order)..........it is a crunchy salad and cilantro with chicken and the crunch of peanuts, wontons and rice sticks. Tossed with a Thai Peanut dressing. The gf got the Cedar Plank Salmon...........the salmon is roasted on a cedar plank with smoked paprika and lime. The dish is served with white corn and spinach succotash topped with feta. What can I say about my meal? I loved the lettuce wraps and could have eaten the whole thing for my dinner........Lol! As for my Thai Crunch Salad, it was just okay for me........I guess I wasn't a big fan of the dressing, but it's always good to try something new.

Maybe once every few months.. and all but once the experience was perfect. (Not bad enough to rant about) Let's start with the beverages. I absolutely LOVE their drinks! My go-to cocktail was the Adobe margarita. It's a spicy margarita served on the rocks with rock salt.  *drOol! I'm pretty critical when it comes to margaritas since so many places make it too damn syrupy with their bottled roses lime juice but either cpk uses a really good brand or it really is squeezed lime, it's a perfectly balanced drink.  I've tried their classic mojitos too and I honestly have to say it's perfect!  Never too sweet and it's just such a pretty drink with fresh muddled mint. I love how the sugar cane adds a natural look to the drink. Besides those two drinks,  I could never stray away enough to try anything else.   I've always been very impressed with their wine list.  It's has always been well known wines with very resonable prices. My all time favorite white wine is the Santa margherita pinot grigio. I swear this wine pairs nicely with so many dishes. It never fails.  I believe a bottle runs about $40 which is shocking since there is barely a markup from grocery store price!  Moving on to the food.. even though I do love their pastas and pizzas, I actually love their appetizers even more.  Our favorite salad is the Arugula quinoa salad.  My husband and I demolish this every.single. time.  Healthy,  light, and delicious.  What more can you ask for in a salad? We've enjoyed their avocado egg rolls,  flat breads,  spinach artichoke dip,  lettuce wraps, etc.. there was nothing that disappointed.  Lastly,  service. The servers we've had have always been so sweet and attentive. Staff always greeted us with smiles and always gave my kids a little extra attention which is always a nice gesture. Managers always made time to stop by our table to check on our dinner experience.  With all that said,  we love cpk specifically kahala and pearlridge.  Btw, they even have a rewards program now,  I believe it's every $100 you spend, you get a bonus $5 off your next visit.  ************* Update,  like I wrote in the tip section,  my new favorite cocktail is their vodka avocado drink.  I think it's called California cooler.  sOo delicious!  Served over ice with a fennel salted rimand garnish with a mint spring!!  And I've convinced myself is a healthy drink cause it's avocados so I can drink up muahaha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=140,3.92,3.71,3.468,3.3440000000000003,3.794

It's nothing spectacular but you can always count on having a pretty good salad, pizza or pasta. And while I'm Never totally thrilled to eat at CPK, we still come here quite often because there are a few things that really do stand out: 1) Service. The service at this particular location is amazing. Friendly, accommodating and super ""local"" make-you -feel-like-you're-family friendly. 2) Kid friendly. They know how to handle kids here! On our last visit 8 kids ages between 3 and 9 took up more than half our table AND they all sat on one side of the table while us 5 adults sat on the the other end. People were staring at us as they walked by as I'm sure it looked like a potential hurricane situation. But our server handled everyone FLAWLESSLY! She managed to get all our kids orders, get all their drinks, dishes, and and plates upon plates of bread to them with perfection and our kids were all happy campers and I'm happy to announce that no hurricanes, ruckuses, fires or meltdowns occurred! The kids were happy so the adults were happy and I commend our server for doing such an excellent job!  3) Birthday parties. They do great birthday parties here for only $10 per kid which includes a make your own pizza, a drink, ice cream sundae, a tour of the kitchen, a coupon for a FREE kids meal for each kid to take home, and a real kid size chef jacket for the birthday child. Can't beat this deal! And the kids love it. We have gone to so many Bday parties here and I have collected those free kids meals coupons at each party that I can't remember the last time we've paid for our kids meals here.  4) Pizza ""dough"" rewards. For every $100 you spend here, you get $5 reward bucks. Those rewards rack up quickly and we always have some kind of discount deal or rewards to use while dining here.  The one thing that can be a bummer is that the wait can be long most times. But the kids like to look at the near by shops and the time goes by quicker than you might think. If you don't want to wait, just order take out online and pick your food up to go. Super simple and quick.  I guess there's a reason that this is the highest grossing CPK in the US.

(Speaking of family oriented - the family next to us that left that big ass mess should be ashamed of themselves. Cups, crayons, food, napkins and other crap should not have been thrown on the floor when your kids are older and aren't in booster seats or high chairs. My three year old was more behaved than that. I'm hoping you left an amazing tip!) Anyways, we ordered the flat bread, a children's pizza, ahi tacos and penne pasta. The children's pizza had pepperoni which was way to spicy for my son. Even Cam thought that it was spicy. The flat bread was pretty good, it had Gorgonzola, mozzarella and truffle oil! My son really enjoyed it but managed to eat around the only green ""leaf"" on the bread.

I thought it was strange when he asked me if I wanted him to box up the 'defected' salad when he brought out the new one.  Probably a standard reflex, but there was no way I wanted that.   It won't ruin me for CPK...I'll still go back.  I just subtracted one star for the experience...otherwise, all of these locations on Oahu are great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=100,4.0,3.78,3.54,3.3760000000000003,3.8680000000000003

This post was going to be a 1 star for the poor performance of the hostess, but the manager, and then the waiter ,Chris, rallied back in such spectacular manner that I am going with a 5. Arrived at the restaurant around 6:15 and was told there was a 40 min wait. It's my son's favorite place so we decided to wait. At 7:00 I went to check with hostess, and was told it would be 10 more minutes. at 7:15 same thing. Finally seated at 7:20. I get this is a popular place, and that you can't control how long people linger at their tables, but this place didn't just open - they know the patterns - how about telling me its an hour and then surprising me when it only 40 minutes? Or... if you tell me 40 minutes, and at 35 minutes there is no chance you are going to seat me in the next 15 to 20 minutes - let me know so  can make a decision about whether or not to wait it out. The place is obviously beyond its capacity so the few people that decide to bail out will not impact the revenue for the night, and at least they wont be pissed. So the recovery - the manager was waiting at our table to apologize (we didn't ask him to do this). He let me and my wife complain about the wait and never interrupted or made any excuses. He offered to comp our appetizers, which we told him he didn't have to do. At the end of the meal he took them off the bill anyway! The waiter, Chris, was also very attentive, and made sure everything going forward was perfect. We have had him before, and this guy is a pro.

I've been to CPK a lot of times, so I familiarized myself with the staff, the food, and even the manager, LOL (Yes, the manager actually walks around the restaurant and converses with customers!). I didn't actually plan to come here, since you can call in for reservations, but after mentioning about going out for dinner, my brother got excited since he LOVES this place. My other brother and mom were okay with going out today, so we did. After checking in for a table, they said it would be a 10 minute wait. They give you a device that vibrates once your table is ready, so you don't have to worry about losing track of time. Go and explore the mall! There's Macy's just right by CPK. Once our table was ready, we were led by our server, Jessica, to our table and we requested for water. Once the water came out, we were ready to order... our appetizers! My crazy brother LOVES their Crispy Mac n' Cheese. He always takes 2 plates of it. We ordered 2 plates of that and also 1 of their Avocado Club Egg Rolls. Seriously, if you're a fan of avocado and a fan of egg rolls, then you NEED to try it. It blows my mind. Each plate comes with 6 rolls and 2 types of sauce (I forgot what it was, but I'll put a picture of the food for you to guess.) We devoured our appetizers and ordered our main courses. My crazy brother got their Pepperoni Pizza since he likes pepperoni pizza, LOL. My other brother got a Fire-Grilled Ribeye (medium rare), my mom got a half Original BBQ Chicken salad, and I got the Italian Chopped half salad. The food came out pretty fast, about 10-15 minutes I would say. They handed me my salad, then my mom's, then the ribeye, and then the pizza. Perfect! Time to dig in! That first of the salad, MAN that was delicious! I really loved the beans in the salad, it give it such a great, satisfying flavor! My mom enjoyed their BBQ Chicken and their avocados (Yes, she added avocados into her salad.). My brother shared a slice of his 12oz ribeye with me and, wow. That is one good steak! There was a lot of flavor and I could really tell they cooked under fire! My crazy brother devoured his pizza, like always. After we were done, we were told if we wanted dessert. Most of the time we did, but we decided not to. We were totally full at the moment... If you do get dessert here, GET THIER BUTTER CAKE WITH ICE CREAM: You won't regret it. :) In total, this dinner was about $73. In my opinion, it's a pricy joint if you were to eat more.

I called for a takeout order, pizza and salad on a weeknight. I was going to drive over to kaneohe with food for my Mom who is undergoing chemo. They quoted me 30- 40 min. I parked in the pick up spot, near cpk ( I think there's a 15 min limit), with about 5 min left to wait (according to their quoted time) and proceeded to pay for my order. ""Almost ready, give us a few more minutes"" they told me.  As I waited, more and more people started showing up for take out orders, it seemed like a crowd was waiting. I got a bit nervous about my parking space, so after waiting +15 minutes,  i asked them how much longer. "" were just waiting on the salad, your pizza is here in the warmer"". Now I used to work takeout at an Italian restaurant and salads are the quickest things to make because it doesn't take time to cook anything, you just assemble.  People around me were starting to get angry, an uncle who had been waiting started yelling at the to go people, which made me feel bad. It seemed like the restaurant wasn't too busy, so what was the trouble? Finally after an hour and fifteen minutes past the time I put in the order, I received my full order with a ""sorry"". Now I'm not one to fish for free things but they should have comped something, thrown in a dessert, or taken a percentage off; that's what our manager would have had us do where I worked. It would have been faster for me to dine in!  Luckily I wasn't towed, but being pregnant, I was ravenous. The second I sat down in the car, I tore into the pizza. It was cold. Of course it was after sitting for 30+ minutes. The crust had gotten stale and it was hard to bite through. I didn't have time to bring it back and ask for another, my mom was already wondering where I was. I sucked it up, and raced over the pali, learning my lesson never to do takeout (and maybe dine in) at Kahala again. ****edit**** The management reached out a couple months after this incident to try and make up for the lack of service.

Upon arriving the hostess told me it would be 1 hour wait time for 11 people. While I waited for 1 hour, I saw multiple parties, as big as 8 go in before me. Mind you, these parties were in line after me. After an hour I asked the hostess how much longer and she stated she told me in the beginning 1 hour to 1.5 hours. I had 4 little children in my party so I'm pretty irritated by now. 1.5 hours passed by and still no table. At this point I have seen people that reserved tables after me go in, eat their food, and  walk out the door. Finally, the manager came out and said they are waiting for 1 more party that was taking a while. This was the last straw, my party decided to go somewhere else. This is the first time in my life I've ever left an establishment. To give you a time frame, I put my name in for a table at 645pm and left at 830, and still without a table. In the end it turned out well though. We went to a much better establishment, mac 24/7, food was excellent and most important the customer service was on point.

Let me share. On 20- May 2017, we paid a visit to Kahala Mall. After conducting our business, we went in search of food. My wife suggested CPK, even though it was on the other side of the mall from where we had conducted our other business.  OK... Walk a little, browse a lot... Got to CPK. They were busy, but not fully packed. I walk with the aid of a walking stick due to a bad L4-L5 disc that without meds would have me laid out on a bed.  We ask for a table for two, and there is clearly no way for the seating hostess to NOT notice 55"" tall walking stick, wrapped with bright orange Paracord on the upper end.  She claims she has no open tables to seat us but we can wait about 10 minutes, or seat at the bar. I told her we would have a drink while we wait for a table.  We walk to the bar. Bartender serves us right away. Great guy. Great drinks.  Directly across from us in the dining room is an open table; I point it out to my wife. Not two minutes after this, the same seating hostess sits a woman and two girls at this table.    A couple on the table next to that gets up and leaves, the table is quickly cleared and another couple that has walked up has been seated.  This proceeds to happen three more times and the same seating hostess walks by us each time like we are chopped liver. The waiter slides us menus. I tell him thank you for the drinks they were great. Cleared my tab and my wife said let's go, I've never felt so disrespected in my life! Never again at KAHALA CPK.

Okay, that's fine, sometimes people have a bad day so we let it slide but the whole time we were dining in, she never came to check on us or refilled our water.

Like meant to sit 1 person on each side! We said that we would like a regular size one and the short lady at the sign in was like ""well you're just gonna have to wait then!"" So rude!!! Furthermore the party she sat before us with only 2 people ended up in a regular size booth!!! How does that make any sense at all? They could've seated them in the mini booth and we could've got the regular sized booth! So we had to wait another 10-20 minutes for a regular sized booth!

Here's we're it all went wrong, the bartender Ashley seemed to be having a rough day and probably wasn't in the best of mood but to take it on customers is uncalled for and unprofessional. She didn't  say ""hi"" or acknowledge any sort of greet and asks if I wanted to get a drink. I decided on the blueberry ginger smash. The ingredients looked great and was excited, as I watched her make the drink everything seemed lovely until she dipped her mixer into the sanitizer sink and mixed the sanitizer with the rest of my drink. I didn't say anything at first hoping she would realize there was foam on my glass and top of my drink but unfortunately she never asked why i didn't drink it through time I was there. I drank my water instead and ordered the chicken Milanese. That I would give a 5 star to and a salute to the cooks and chefs who put that together. Looked wonderful and was very pleasant to eat. Yet again Ashley the bartender gave an unpleasant attitude which made sitting at the bar very awkward and uncomfortable. She started closing down the bar, throwing materials into the sink. And never once asking about my food or drink. Never again will I want to sit at the bar when she works there. Finally she drops the check and didn't bother taking the drink off even though it was right in front of her untouched throughout the entire night. Now it started to just get stressful. I had to call her over and politely said I wanted to return the drink because of the sanitizer foam all over the drink. She replied oh it's soda water but ok. At that point I just paid and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2?start=60,3.36,3.68,3.624,2.6280000000000006,3.5520000000000005

The Kahala Mall location is typically busy throughout the day, which is what makes this location the tops in the nation.  You are given a buzzer to be notified when your table is ready.  Not only is this location their busiest, they have the best staff in Hawaii.  Not once have I had a bad experience.  Time for the food... Every successful meal at CPK begins with the Spinach Artichoke Dip (served with chips).  This dip is their signature appetizer, and definitely starts your meal off right.  Whether with my boyfriend, family or friends, we typically order a salad and a pizza to share.  For salads, I recommend the Waldorf Chicken or Thai Crunch salad.  For pizzas, the Jamaican Jerk Chicken is bomb -- my absolute favorite.  For a lighter option, the White Pizza is good.  As a tip, if getting this pizza, ask for Truffle Oil on the side.  Your taste buds will be excited. California Pizza Kitchen revamps their menus for the season providing different options from the norm, while keeping their base menu the same.  Dine here and your stomach will leave happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2,3.36,3.71,3.636,3.024,3.5700000000000003

I thought I had dodged it while in there but it stuck to the bottom of my shoes and made a sickening suction noise as I walked backed to my table. I asked my wife how the woman's restroom was and she said it had not been deep cleaned for a long time. I hope the main manager of the restaurant reads this and takes action on cleaning the bathrooms and responds to this post.  We keep telling ourselves never to go back to a CPK again but this time we really aren't going to go to one again. One dish was good (we shared that) but  the other one was a cream pasta dish with no cream. When they tried to fix it it came out COLD (pasta not reheated) and looked like the cook put in a crazy amount of cold garlic cream sauce l, it was worse off now  and I politely declined to pay for it when the check came. We both couldn't eat it, had one bite and both felt sick when we left. Gave a generous tip for the waiter for trying to help us but sometimes you wonder about the wisdom of sending the dish back to the kitchen to be corrected. Having extensive experience in working at restaurants my wife knows a lot about the staffs back room chatter concerning customers that are not pleased with their meal.  I guess if you really like CPK and stick to dishes that you know will be consistent then that's your choice. We remember when CPK first came to Hawaii and it has really gone down hill. The Kailua location dishes taste like they move food from somewhere else and then reheat it.

I was pretty disappointed with the service.  I ordered my meals online and they said that it would be ready in 17 minutes.  When I arrived there, it looked like they weren't very organized.  I already knew that it was gonna be a long wait, because I saw about five people standing around waiting for their food.  This was already a bad sign for me because in my previous visit, I had no problems.  I ordered online, went straight to the counter, paid, and left soon after.  So I thought it would be the same today.  So of course, I just carried my baby instead of taking out the stroller.  Big mistake.  At the take out section, they have a pick up line and an order line.  There was only one lady working both lines.  So when she was done taking someone's order, she would move to the order side to the pick up line.  It really didn't look like they were short staffed because I saw two more people helping her.  But both of those people were getting the orders.  Maybe it would have been more efficient if one of the runners was at the line instead.  I don't know how long I had to wait, but it seemed like forever, since that lady was trying to make sure that the people ahead got their orders, took orders from the new people, and checked on pick up orders.  Also my baby wasn't having it either.  She's such a wiggle worm so when we had to stand in line for that long, she was getting antsy.  She was trying to climb all over me and she even tried to grab the lady's hair in front of us.  Finally it was our turn and I had no intention of giving this lady a hard time.  She really was trying her best and no one was really helping her.  Then I hear one of the runners scolding her because she's not saying the name on the order so they can get it from the back.  I just wanted to roll my eyes.  Poor girl.  It's like that game Diner Dash, where you quickly have to service people or they will start getting mad and leaving.   Both my husband and I ordered pastas.  He ordered the Jambalaya pasta and I ordered the garlic cream fettucine.  He liked his and he said that it was the right amount of hotness.  I thought mine was okay.  I probably could have made better.  The noodles were a little overcooked and were all stuck to each other.  Also for my pasta, it doesn't come with any kind of topping, so I ordered shrimp with mine.  Just adding the shrimp costs $5.00 extra.  I think I had a total of 5 shrimp, $1 a shrimo.   I'm not sure what the big hype is about CPK.  I always see people just standing outside of the restaurant waiting for a table.  I thought their take out would be a good option for us since we never go out anymore.  But it really wasn't worth it.  We go to a closer restaurant and CPK really can't beat them.  You don't need to even get out of your car for their take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2,3.28,3.61,3.616,2.9880000000000004,3.478

The food was good, they don't offer too many vegetarian dishes but we tried our best.  We started off with the buffalo cauliflower (ask for the cheese and cream sauce on the side). I really like this dish.  Next we had the wild mushroom strozzapreti. A little oily but tasted good...since I love mushrooms. This is the dish for mushroom lovers.

16,Warren N.,"Honolulu, HI",108,102,109.0,4.0,2017-10-09,"A long 3-day weekend deserves CPK! The Kahala location always seems slammed and Friday night was no exception. The wait was about 20 minutes for the two of us...not bad. They've added some new items to their menu so I had to try the piadina and soup combo. It comes in ancho chile short rib or smashed chicken meatball. I opted for the short rib and wasn't disappointed. The piadina is served with your choice of soup, which makes this quite a deal for $13.45. Yes it's a small cup of soup but it's plenty enough to balance the piadina. Piadinas are like an unsealed calzones I guess. This one was packed with lots of flavor from slow-cooked short ribs and a medium spicy ancho chile sauce. Arugula is also included to add a touch of green. My opinion: totally could do without the arugula and totally could do with more cheese. I chose the creamy baked potato soup to accompany my piadina. Good choice: creamy soup to temper the fire of the ancho chile.  I've had piadina sandwiches (see my review of Piadina in Tustin CA) and the CPK version is not quite as good as Piadina's, but It comes close. Coupled with the soup it makes a filling meal.  As always, we really only came to CPK for the butter cake sans $1.75 scoop of Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream. Lol. As is sometimes the case the server forgot and added the ice cream anyway. Then we got told: ""Sorry, we added the ice cream on top by mistake. Do you want it anyway or should we remake it? We won't charge you for our mistake. I hope you aren't lactose intolerant...""  Lol...it's BUTTER cake.  Kudos to the staff for being considerate. Also, our server Joanna was excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2,3.28,3.61,3.628,3.248,3.478

However the prices have been going up while the quality has definitely gone down. Tonight we phone ordered ahead, waited about 20min at home before driving the 10min to the mall. Order was ready so that was good. Got home, took out my ""full-sized"" Waldorf salad and not only was there no dressing included but the salad was so small it barely filled one side of the takeout container! I think I could grab up the entire salad in one hand, including the 5 mini pieces of chicken, and I'm a really small person! For $16.49?!! No way! Pizzas were already cooled before even leaving the mall and are now so small my 11 yr old daughter finished the entire thing in one sitting. Add to that rude staff (what happened to the good pleasant wait staff that used to work there?!!) and I think I'll be spending my money elsewhere. Update: The hubby drove back to Kahala Mall to return the salad which I didn't want anymore and to show them what we were talking about (we called ahead of time to complain). He was refunded the cost and given a ""new"" salad free of charge with the explanation of ""We're sorry, sir. This has never happened before!"" Yeah, right. But I have to give them props for trying to remedy the situation.

I've dined here numerous times and we always get horrible service - this visit so far has been an exception.  Chicken Milanese: one of my favorite all time dishes here! It has three generous portions of flattened chicken breasts fried in panko, covered with arugula and topped with a DELICIOUS checca sauce (tomato, garlic, basil and olive oil). It comes with one lemon to squeeze over the top. Shrimp scampi zucchini fettuccine: I love this dish! It's half zoodles half fettuccine. It's really light and fresh, but you still get your pasta fix. The sauce is super tasty and be sure to get fresh Parmesan grated on top!  Desserts: the salted caramel pudding is to die for! It's a light dessert and the taste is AWESOME! Salty and sweet and just right. I love the chocolate cookie crumbs at the bottom. The portion is just right for one person.  Tonight I tried the chocolate soufflé with ice cream.  The soufflé melted in my mouth! I honesty could have done without the ice cream - the soufflé held its own and the whipped cream would have been just fine. This was a heavier and larger dessert, better for sharing! Overall I like CPK because of their fresh dining options, this location could improve on service - if every night was like tonight I would give 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2,3.32,3.51,3.608,,3.434
15,Chelsea S.,"Honolulu, HI",10,42,237.0,3.0,2017-10-19,"If you're ever planning to go to Kahala Mall, CPK could be a very satisfying choice for lunch or dinner! Note the word ""planning"" because this place can get very busy. Always arrive or check-in 30 minutes or more before your desired dining time as there is almost always a waiting time. Don't fret though because you can kill your time walking around the mall! (Hint: You can sit at the bar and not have to wait!) Every time I go to CPK, I'm always pretty satisfied. The taste of the food is good. Never can go wrong with the Thai Crunch Salad, BBQ Chicken Pizza, or Chicken Picatta (my favorite). I've also ordered/tasted the Santa Fe Bowl, Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, The Original BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and Grilled Veggie Sandwich. Sante Fe Bowl: A very healthy choice but nothing special and flavor was kind of bland. Chicken Tequila Fettuccine: Quite delicious and has an interesting flavor. It's creamy but does not have a distinct flavor. The noodles were also very thick and too al dente for me. Original BBQ Chicken Sandwich: Very tasty sandwich! Highly recommend with Baked Potato Soup. However, I had this with a yummy, cheesy bread on my first try and after that, they used regular bread. Not sure if the chef was different but if you can, try to request this cheesy, herby bread. Grilled Veggie Sandwich: Another healthy choice but it's kind of sad and the veggies are bland. Doesn't fill you up nor satisfies. Also I tried the Sicilian Pizza with thin crust. It's pretty tasty but not sure if the combination of the meats makes this one of the saltier pizzas... The least favorable thing about this place is your bill can get pretty high because the prices aren't very cheap. My suggestion: split dishes among your party as much as you can. Their portions are enough to split but not enough to leave you stuffed. Service is usually good. They can get busy so don't be surprised if you aren't visited too often or receive a lot of attention. The waiters/waitresses are friendly but honestly, you're just another dollar-sign to most of them... Nevertheless, CPK is a great family spot and casual lunch/dinner restaurant!

It left my bf and I trippin' After being seated, our server Katarina was very sweet and got our orders in right away. Within minutes, we were served our food and waters! Which was fantastic. Hence, why I gave an extra star. Now, afterwards got a little interesting. I ordered the sangria flight- never came. I understand, being a server myself, that things happen with the bar and that it's the holidays, so it's busy.. So i canceled the order when our server came around 20 minutes later saying that it should be ready then, and i assured her that it was totally fine (which it was. i'm not easily impatient)  Now, we waited. And waited. And waited. 20 minutes. No one checked to see if we were okay, no one checked to see if we needed refills, no one asked if we needed boxes for the food. We didn't even ask for our check, it was just dropped on our table with a ""take your time"" and she (not our server) was gone before i could even ask for a take-out box. The next interaction we got was ""are you done with this?"" in regards to our balsamic on our table and then, without even answering, she (another not our server girl) dipped out with the balsamic before i could (again) ask for a take out box!!  Then we waited ANOTHER 20 minutes until my bf had to wave down a busser to ask if we had to go up to the host stand to pay, which he denied and immediately got someone (thank you, nice busser!!! we appreciated you!) A lady with a light up necklace (manager?) came to take our check and i had to ask for a to-go box before she disappeared!

Check dropped at 8:25ish. ignored AGAIN for 20 minutes.  finally got take out box, ran our card and left at 8:47, nearly an hour after we had finished eating and no sign of our server anywhere to even ask if we needed dessert or anything.

I decide to meet my family for dinner here, what's a 15-30 minute wait when I've been shopping for hours prior to finally deciding to grab a bite to eat?!  I check in and was given a buzzer. I was told the wait time for 3 would about a 15-30 minute wait. I asked the hostess about how far will the buzzer work up to and she told me up to Champs. Great to know! I decide to go into Macy's to browse a bit. About 10 minutes later, my family find me there and couple minutes later the buzzer vibrates that our table is ready. I give the hostess my buzzer but in the meantime my family find 3 seats at the bar. Just a tip, id there are open seats at the bar counter, there is no wait time. Ao we decide instead of sitting at a table to eat at the bar counter. The service here is always great! The bartenders are always really super cool and always on their toes! These people hustle! For the sake of me, I forgot our server/bartender's name, but he is part Samoan from what I heard him say. Super friendly guy and great at what he does! First off he takes our drink orders. I order a flight of 3 different red wine. My son orders a cup of milk, and the husband orders an iced tea and 3 waters. Shortly after we get our drinks and then he takes our order. I decided on the Wild Caught Sesame Seared Ahi. Sesame-crusted Ahi tuna steak with seared baby bok choy, over a stir-fry of roasted farro, Shiitake mushrooms and red chili. My son got curly mac and cheese with edamame, my husband got chicken piccata, and we also got spinach artichoke dip with pita bread as a sub to the tortilla chips it normally comes with.  The bartender brings us some house bread with some evoo. Our spinach artichoke dip is then brought out. This is always a good starter. It could actually be a meal. Our food came out pretty quick. After all the bread and some of the artichoke bread on a piece of pita bread, I was getting a full. I ate several bites of my ahi dish and it was good. The ahi was tender and the crust on it was flavorful. I'd eat a little bit of the ahi with a small piece of a baby bok choy and roasted farro. So good! I highly enjoyed my dish! My son always enjoys his curly mac and cheese with edamame. He whacked his pretty quickly. My husband also said his dish was good. Very flavorful and something he tends to order on a regular basis. After we had eaten enough to fill out bellies, we decided on the pound cake dessert with vanilla ice cream. This is always our favorite dessert to share. We moped this as well, best part of the dessert is the bottom side of the cake, it's really buttery. Everything was great including the server/bartender. Always so pleasant and friendly. My family and I will most definitely return.

It's not cheap.  But if you want and expect cheap food, this is not where you should be eating.  Price should be compared in the context of the level and style of the food, otherwise it's nonsense. I love places like 12th Ave, but, CPK can match quality, is more consistent, and is about 1/2 the price. We mostly rotate eating out among places like 12th Ave, Town, Sabrina's, Pig and Lady, Maguro Ya, etc., we feel it's important to support locally owned non-franchise places, and yet CPK Kahala holds it's own among these and other excellent restaurants in Honolulu. We can't resist now and then, this somewhat guilty pleasure. What stands out is consistency in food quality and service:  just outstanding. Creativity and variety of the menu is really good, service is excellent in our experience.  Venture out and try some of the main courses other than the pizza!  (which is really good as well) To sit at the counter on a slammingly busy night during the holiday season is an impressive experience, what you'll see is a cheerful, friendly and efficient staff that works as a team, truly a well oiled machine.  Impressive training is partly responsible, but I am just so impressed with this place, I think this is one of the best food values for mid-upper level dinner in Honolulu.

We will definitely be back again in hopes of having Grace again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2,3.6,3.5,3.624,,3.5400000000000005

6,Cheryl N.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,1.0,1.0,2018-01-14,"Take out service is unreliable!  Placed my order at 10:30 in the morning to pick up at 5:15 p.m. Get there to pick it up and they did not even make it yet and it was only a salad!  no pizzas or pastas. The person rings me up and then tells me that they didn't cook the chicken for the salad yet so it will be another 15 minutes. What is the point of having take out where you can place your order ahead if you can't have it ready for pick up! I waited 25 minutes for an order that I placed ahead. No apology offered for the wait either!  Gave this place another chance...Big Mistake!  Went there for take out again and placed a phone order, which they said would be ready in 45 minutes. ordered a salad and a pizza.  Get there at the stated time and there were at least 6 people waiting on the side of the take out counter for there orders. I paid for my order and then ended up waiting another 25 minutes for it. While waiting I over hear other customers complaining about the wait for there orders. When the order is finally ready the guy at the counter gives it to me with no apology or thank you for waiting.  This CPK totally sucks and I definitely won't be going back!  It is poorly managed and the staff at the take out counter have a total lack of customer service skills!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu-2,3.64,3.5,3.636,,3.5560000000000005
