5,Eric R.,"Savannah, GA",19,14,6.0,4.0,2014-02-21,"I went with my lady tonight. This place looks amazing for a chain. I ordered the full rack of ribs dry rubbed which comes with cinnamon apples and fries. This was super good very surprising. My fiancé ordered the 10 oz sirlon which comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli. She said it was very good. She also ordered the corn on the cob on a stick. She said it was good but to much pepper. The wait staff was quick and only made one mistake they gave us water instead of sweet tea. They have a little computer on ur table and u can play 1 dollar games on it while u wait order more drinks appetizers and pay for ur food. Awesome. The floor was super slippery though not sure why. So everything positive other than slippery floors, error in drink, and the time the between order placed and food served took a while.

2,Madison P.,"Bowling Green, KY",11,231,152.0,3.0,2014-03-12,"Friday Night dinner out. The Long Island Ice Tea is delicious.  I ordered the Mango-Chile Tilapia.   I asked the waitress if it was overly spicy.  She suggested I have the sauce on the side.  The sauces are really spicy. The fish was OK, a bit overdone around the edges.  Glad I took her advice.  The broccoli was cooked to perfection.  It was bright green and still had a bit of a crunch. My husband ordered rib eye steak and fully loaded mashed potatoes.  He said the steak was good but not the best around town.  He didn't like the potatoes.  I tasted them and thought the added ingredients were over the top. I ordered the Triple Dipper Appetizer  which had boneless buffalo wings, southwestern egg rolls, big mouth bites/2 slider burgers.  It came with the standard ranch dressing for the boneless wings.  I couldn't eat the egg rolls the filling was too spicy for my taste.   I think it is a great idea that you can pay at the table via an electronic screen with your card.  If you have kids they can play games as long as you are there for 99 cents.   The one thing that really put me off was that when I hit the amount for my husband to swipe his card I stopped him  because either the waitress, manager or the machine is preset for a 20% tip.  I understand that the majority of a waitress's pay comes from tips.  However, i don't like anyone assuming I want to give 20% or anything.  I thought our server was adequate not good.  So I put it down to 15%. When I get really good service I give 25%.  I tip according to the Quality of Service I receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005

13,Amanda H.,"Pooler, GA",18,20,6.0,2.0,2014-03-23,"It seems as though some of the other diners had the same issues we did when dining at this Chili's. My fiance and I really like Chili's and were happy that one was opening up in Pooler. We went for lunch and once we were seated, it seemed to take forever for someone to approach us to take a drink order. We actually almost left and then our waitress finally stopped by. We put in our order and then waited.....and waited.....and  waited. After a while, the manager came by and asked us what we ordered. We told him what we ordered and he left. Then......we waited, and waited and waited. He came back again and apologized for the wait and said the waitress had put our order in incorrectly. We said that's ok and again....you guessed it...waited for quite a while. FINALLY our order comes and sadly, it was lukewarm. We didn't say anything because who knows how long it would have taken to get it heated up. Our waitress comes by when we are almost done eating(we hadn't seen her since we initially put our order in) and asked if we wanted a refill of water. His water was about half way full and mine was still full so we said no. Then she comes by a couple minutes later and says something like she hates not giving him more so she goes ahead and refills his cup. He didn't drink any of it the rest of the time we were there so that was pretty much a waste.  Unfortunately, this was probably my worst experience eating at a Chili's and from reading some of the other reviews, it will not be our first choice if we are wanting something in the area vs. heading into Savannah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=20,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

The food was excellent. No complaints there. I had a pomegranate margarita that would rival any real bar. That's it for the pros.  Our food was very slow, first drinks came out extremely watered down. We sent them back. They came back fresh and good. After waiting for such a long time for food, our server was attentive.

The bar setup is awesome. They have huge tv's, and they have great beer/happy hour specials. The weekend bartender is friendly, although I wouldn't go in if she was not working. They advertise that they always have BOGO drinks, although it is very deceiving because they give you very small beer mugs. Although you are getting BOGO, you are drinking out of a 10oz mug rather than a 12/16oz mug. They happy hour food specials aren't bad, although the food takes forever to come out.

11,Kyle C.,"Pooler, GA",1,24,,2.0,2014-08-16,"Wife and I went on a Thursday night, waited about 15 minutes to be seated in what seemed to be a pretty empty restaurant. Got seated, had a pleasant server that took our drink orders and brought them out. While waiting on her to come back so we could order, we both needed refills. The server was no where we could see, so we flagged down a different server to ask if we could bug her for a refill, which she kindly obliged.  Ordered food finally, ribs and a medium steak and guacamole for my wife. Guacamole was great, ribs were good, but the steak was way overcooked. Annoying, but not a HUGE deal. So I asked the server if I could have one made as I ordered it. Waited another twenty minutes and she brought out a thick steak, asked me to check it out. I cut in to it and it was beat red. The server took a step back and put her hand over her mouth. I thought she was laughing at first but she was actually gagging. It was literally just seared on the outside and completely raw inside. I asked for the manager.  He came out after ten minutes, I explained the issues, patiently. (No point in being a dick) he listened and then apologized, then started to bash his cooks, bash his servers and trash talk how corporate had messed up this location or whatever. I put my hand up and said"" I don't need to hear all of this. I dont need an explanation or excuse and it really bothers me that this place is managed by someone who would so quickly throw his people under the bus. I'd just like to leave I'll pay for the guacamole and drinks but that's it."" He said ok and adjusted the bill accordingly. My wife and I left and still ripped the server on what the tab would have been.  Very sad that management would throw their people down like that, poor service or not.

We order the Texas cheese fries for our appetizer but it was missing the jalapeño we had to ask twice for them. I notice that the table next to ours was missing theirs also so the cook must not have known that it's suppose to be jalapeños. So my mother ordered a burger cut the sauce add mayo and instead of fries she wanted a salad. They brought her fries and we had to ask a total of 4 times for her salad. The burger was missing the mayo. The waiter asked my aunt if she would like cob or kernel corn my aunt replied kernel, he repeated kernel and yet still brought cob and said he heard cob. Well we chopped it up to maybe he was new so we would forgive all of the mistakes and we laid a pretty hefty tip down, but on returning with our checks my aunt gave him a $50 bill for a meal that cost 20 something and he brought her out $2. So she told him of this mistake and he says you have me A 30. My aunt replies please check your register because I gave you one bill which was a 50 they do not make $30 bill sweetie. So he goes to the back to check and the manager brings out her correct change and says that the waiter made a mistake and asked him to bring it back out.  I also noticed that the family next to us were having issues also.

If your're a Chili's fan and gotta have it then your decision has already been made.  If you are on the fence and want this Tex-Mex style there is the fan favorite Moe's and Jalapeno's adjacnet, Chipotle is right down the street as well.  I've been to these a bunch of times, never disappointed.  You can thank me later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

Literally sitting here in chilis wondering how this place is still running?? Salad....side salad.... So anyway, when I first got here I opened my menu and it was sipping wet. Why?

I was greeted right away by the super nice host but I will say once seated at the bar we did wait awhile to be greeted. No worries, the two bartenders made up for that with their happy hour knowledge & those great $5 presidente margaritas. Not too sweet & sugary like most. blah. Nice & tart with a Tad hint of sweetness to really go with that tequila. Yum. I ordered my chicken & carnita fajitas & enjoyed them as usual. LIME marinated chicken & pork topped with cilantro, onions, peppers.....& all the rest of the traditional fajita fixings. I personally think Chili's is better than some of these ""so called authentic"" Mexican spots that rip ppl off. Now I  definitely don't think this place is THE BEST but I enjoy it for what it is.

34,Brian M.,"Tumwater, WA",66,63,11.0,1.0,2016-02-14,"I must say that I am highly disappointed in this place.  The last few times that we have been here, there have been some big problems.  First and foremost, our appetizers came out burnt and warm.  You could tell that they were sitting in the window for quite some time.  Secondly, I waited 15 minutes for my first beer and almost the same for my second...the excuse being that the bar is backed up.  Now I'm not a genius, but obviously the management doesn't know how to manage here.  So onto our food.  My wife and I both bordered the skillet steak meals, which looked awesome in the picture.  However, what we got looked like something my dog wouldn't eat.  I ordered my steak Med. Rare, and when I cut into it, it was raw, not even rare.  So I checked another section and it was the same.  So I brought it up to the waiter and he said that he would get me another one and apologized profusely.  The manager brought out the plate and I noticed it was the same steak with the same cut marks and piece cut off.  I immediately asked him if this was the same steak, and his reply was yes, ""that's how we do it here"".  As he walked away, my daughter and wife saw him look at our server and swipe his hands together in a cleaning motion and smile.  Not sure what is going on here, but I'll say this, we won't be back to this place ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
10,Adam P.,"Manassas, VA",139,6,3.0,1.0,2016-03-06,"Just hopped off 95 for some dinner. You'd think you could rely on a chain restaurant, considering they have a set system handed down from corporate. This place has a couple loose screws. Server got our drinks quickly with a refill close behind, chips and salsa as well. When it came time to order our server looked at my girlfriend as if she had two heads. Once we got our orders in we didn't see our server until he delivered the food. He sat down a plate of enchiladas, black beans, and rice. Clearly all have been microwaved the tortilla shells were tough and rubber throughout and hard at the ends. The edge of the plate had burnt on bean sauce that couldn't be whipped off with a wet napkin. This was the dirtiest plate I've ever seen. My plate was shrimp tacos a scoop of rice and cup of black beans. Everything was cold.  The shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. Seemed like the whole plate was taken out of the fridge. Server never came back to ask how the food was so we flagged down another server and asked if it was supposed to be cold and it wasn't. She took it back saying they will get it fixed. No apologies. Our server came back after a minute or two and said it was being fixed. I had lost my appetite by then and told him I didn't want it anymore. He simply said okay and ran off with nothing to say and no apologies. Waited for my girlfriend to finish her plate paid the check at the on table kiosk after the discount was made to the check and left. He didn't deserve the $2 we left for tip.

42,Elaine M.,"Richmond Hill, GA",0,3,,1.0,2016-03-15,"Seriously?! One would think they (chili's) would have it down by now..from the time we walked through the door to the relief we felt leaving and confirming the unspoken misery we endured for ""lunch"".  We were shuffled into the bar as we were told by the hostess our service would be very slow otherwise. We waited what seemed to be an eternity to be greeted but in actuality it was 8 minutes, thanks to my lengthy conversation with my boss, via text to confirm the time. Ordered a tea and water, believe me when I tell you I would have done anything for a margarita to ease the pain of waiting..we hastily ordered Texas cheese fries which were a glob of half melted cheese on soggy sad cold fries. My fajitas came later with barely a sizzle and semi raw bell peppers. And as the server set them down declared they were over cooked. I didn't care I was famished and couldn't wait any longer. My husbands sad little over cooked steak was laying lifeless on his plate.. Do they put pictures on the menu to tease us? When I got up to use the restroom I realized no one was in the restaurant.. The bar had all the patrons on this particular afternoon. I struck up a conversation with the waitress to discover the regional manager had just left.. What was it like when he was there? Was this the best they had to offer? Just confirmed it is tastier, cheaper, more fun to stay home! I will take some time to get over the disappointment and waste of time it was to try to have lunch at Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pooler?start=40,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

Trust me this is the best chain restaurant in pooler. No place is perfect, but chilis does their best to fix their mistakes. I have never had a problem here, unlike Logans or cheddars. The Buffalo wings are the best. Better than Buffalo Wild Wings I think. Every time I order a steak it is always cooked to medium rare perfection. The wait staff is always friendly to me, and I'm friendly back. I always leave a very generous tip.

We've been here quite a few times and had similar experiences each time. We've usually been seated fairly quickly but once it's time to be served, the experience goes to crap. We consistently have to wait a while before we are even greeted by our server. The food always takes a while to come out, longer than it should. The food quality is hit or miss.

Now for the service, our waitress breezy wasn't very friendly or informative (menu has changed a lot since our last visit to chili's 2 years ago). She kept asking if we were ready & we had to ask her to give us more time while we looked through the menu. I get they have the new check zioks to pay your check, but she didn't even comeback to see if we wanted to get the check. I also want to add the cleanliness of this place isn't great.

Seated immediately even though they were briskly busy, the server delivered drinks and took our order promptly. One of us had the Triple Bites- a nice combo of 3 appetizers. The other had prime rib tacos. They were served in less than 10 minutes, hot, fresh, and with the little extras we requested. Both were delicious, the server was friendly but not obtrusive, and we got drink refills without having to flag someone down.  This, overall, was a pretty darn good experience. The prices are reasonable, and the selection is plentiful.
