Christina T.,Stockton  CA,24,19,31,11/24/2017,4.0,"Alright! Let me start by saying we had a party of 30ppl celebrating my nephew\'s bday. My SIL was able to reserve an 8:00pm dinner time. We had 2 tables and 2 waitresses. SERIOUSLY  THEY WERE AMAZING! We were seated at 8:00pm  had our food by 8:30pm  were singing ""Happy Birthday"" at 9:00pm  bills paid and done by 9:40pm!The only food complaint was a little bit of a dry steak. Other than that  everything else was amazing; honey chicken crisp salad  CA club sandwich  tacos  ribs  salmon  appetizer platter -- TONS OF FOOD! One soda was flat - they promptly replaced it. Of course there\'s going to be some hiccups with a big party! But  our service was good! I was pleasantly surprised considering my previous BJ\'s Brewhouse experiences in my home city has been less than pleasant."
Missy H.,Fremont  CA,67,16,,11/18/2017,1.0,"This is a long one so bare with me:Previously  I would have given BJ\'s a 4 star. Their food is very consistent. We\'ve dined in  Door Dashed and picked up to go previously with no big issues. We usually end up waiting about 5-10 minutes for take away orders. And honestly if I hadn\'t dealt with the manager at every turn in this experience  I would have let this go but the manager couldn\'t care less so I\'m hesitant to go back.Last night  I put in an order at about 4:50PM with a scheduled pick up at 5:30PM. It was a Friday night so I expected them to be busy and they were.When I arrived with my one year old in tow  there was a gentleman in front of me and behind me and we all paid for our food and sat down to wait. 45 minutes later (almost an hour and a half after the order was placed)  my one year old was getting tired an hungry so I stepped up to the counter and told the manager who had rung me up that I\'d like to cancel my order and get a refund because I was leaving. Like magic  my order was ready but we were just waiting on my salad. I had been watching the counter and hadn\'t seen them bring food out in a while  which meant our food had been in the warmer a while and no one was checking it. I was out the door within 5 minutes of trying to get a refund but when I got home  they had forgotten our appetizer. I called right away and spoke with the same manager - you know  the one who rang me up  the one I told I\'d been waiting 45 minutes  the one I asked for a refund  THE ONE WHO PACKED UP MY ORDER WHILE I STOOD THERE. I told him I was the one who had waited 45 minutes and that he forgot our appetizer. He told me he remembered me and that it was still in the warmer. His only offer was to make me a new one so I could come pick it up. What?! I advised him that I had a small child who was getting ready for bed so that wasn\'t possible  to which he said ""well you paid for it "" and I replied ""yes  I did."" Silence. I sat there gave my husband an eye roll and he said ""what\'s going on?"" Still silence. Finally the manager said ""well  I could adjust your bill "" to which I said ""thank you"".A few things bother me about this:1 - if I were dining in  I would have been served faster than I was with a take away order 2 - Why did the manager panic when I asked for a refund and throw my order together? If losing customers is a concern  keep up on the to go orders and don\'t make people keep waiting if their food is ready.3 - Why was the manager so hesitant to refund me for something HE personally forgot to put in my order?4 - He only addressed half of my complaint because in what universe is it OK to give someone a 40 minute pick up time and make them wait 45 minutes beyond that? If I hadn\'t asked for a refund  who knows how long I would have been there. The gentleman who paid before me was still there when I left  though his food was probably sitting in that warmer..."
Alicia Marie P.,San Jose  CA,210,222,82,11/11/2017,3.0,Cons: door dash took forever  said the restaurant took forever to prepare just 2 meals. Burger ordered arrived cold and gross  I'm guessing they made that first and it just sat and sat waiting for the other meal. Pros:Honestly the shoshito peppers with pepperoni is mind blowing. I could live off that dish. It's highly salty but so delicious.
L N.,San Jose  CA,65,145,10,12/1/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Service was much better today. We ordered the same food and it was cooked well. And the Brussel sprouts weren't burnt this time and We actually received the srichacha sauce this time. Our order was right.
Mika B.,Newark  CA,114,174,932,10/16/2017,4.0,This is probably the third time I've ever been to this restaurant. I came here to have lunch with my old coworker who retired so we kept it simple she had breakfast and I myself had a Caesar salad and a ham and cheese melt. Ryan our servicer was really nice I asked for no sauce for this no sauce for that and he accommodated me. The order was perfect but I have to say that the food was pretty much like black bear or IHOP maybe a little bit better than IHOP. The restaurant was very clean we were seated really fast and since it was Sunday it was actually pretty busy. I have to say that the one thing I find a bit crazy; the menu is literally an Encyclopedia I think they really need to cut down the size of their menu it is way too big so it takes a while to figure out what you want to eat.So on to the food itself the Caesar salad is a Caesar salad but was actually really good and the ham and cheese grilled was not bad however I found it a little bit oily and the French fries were really good. I really appreciate the fact that Ryan came back and fourth to the table asking if we needed anything and always kept our drinks filled so I have to say customer service is definitely top-notch over here. They really do pay a lot of attention to their customers and I appreciate that and they don't leave dirty plates all over the table but clean it up as soon as you're finished. Since we sat there and talked for a while he never came over and disturbed us and made us feel that we had to rush out of there and I really appreciated that per say the four stars! Thank you again BJ it was great having a chance to catch up with my friend in your restaurant
Alex V.,Milpitas  CA,69,60,18,11/28/2017,2.0,I usually like this place  but this was my first time at this location and it wasn't a great experience. The service was very slow and when my flat bread pizza finally arrived to the table  the entire middle was cold and under cooked. I noticed I wasn't the only table having issues with their food. other tables has sent back burgers and chicken for being under cooked.
Dominique E.,Fremont  CA,18,38,25,7/26/2017,4.0,Bj's is a good restaurant overall. They're reasonably priced and their food is pretty good! The only reason why they received four stars  instead of five is because the portion of calamari we got tonight. My friends and I paid around $11 for calamari  but only half the long skinny plate it was served on was full. The other half of the plate was filled the two sauces. If I'm being charged $11 for a plate of calamari  I expect to get my money's worth not a couple of pieces.. lol. Anyways  overall my visit was good. Especially  thanks to our server Michael!! We came in pretty late and he was still really attentive and nice. Thanks Michael!
Mel G.,Oakland  CA,11,186,232,11/19/2017,4.0,Second time here since they pretty much opened up the place. My buddy brought me for my birthday and j had the lemon parm crusted chicken. First time it came out raw gave it another Chance and it was yummy. We had the flight which all were pretty good to me but one. Dessert was delicious. Pretty much had a way better experience with the food this time around than my last time. Luckily I got to give it another chance.
Robert B.,Union City  CA,0,14,3,11/20/2017,1.0,I ordered a Pepperoni Extreme and there was absolutely nothing Extreme about it! Hardly any pepperoni  NO SAUCE and just a sprinkle of cheese. I doubt I'll ever go back. I'll just go to Shakers pizza instead  at least it will cost less and I'll get a decent amount of pepperoni on my pizza.
Mar M.,Union City  CA,44,100,31,10/23/2017,1.0,Went to get some take out from BJ's and ended up waiting almost an HOUR for my food. It wasn't overly packed as well. The manager didn't seem to care that I've been waiting and passed me off to an assistant. This place usually has okay service but it's definitely been slipping as of late...not surprised they're down to a 3-Star rating.So after forty minutes I ask the waitress and GUESS WHAT...the food had been in their warming drawer for the last ten minutes...they didn't bother to check whose order it was since I was never given an update. You don't treat your customers like this. Managers and staff were terrible...JUST TERRIBILE.
Preet S.,Fremont  CA,32,3,4,11/13/2017,1.0,This was the wurst experience I had here. Pizza crust was completely uncooked. Manager took the feedback for future but no action today  lol. Let's see what would improve in future. I know there service was always bad but food use to cope up with bad service but now with both food and service being bad I don't know if they can be boy survive on Booz and desserts.
Aide P.,San Bruno  CA,14,1,1,11/12/2017,5.0,April was my waitress and she is amazing very great i recommend this place the best service and again April made our experience enjoyable
Nohemy C.,San Jose  CA,17,202,197,10/13/2017,1.0,DO NOT COME HERE FOR FOOD IF YOU LOVE FOOD. The service was actually not too bad here although they seem to get really busy so it can take quite a bit to get anything. I am upset about the damn soup. I was sick so I couldn't eat their pizza or burgers so I ordered their chicken tortilla soup. First mistake was that they were out of bread bowls-at 4:30 pm on a Friday!! Come on  people! Second mistake  I paid $7.25 for a freaking 3 ounces of flavored broth with six mini pieces of avocado and some cilantro sprinkled on top. There was 1 bite size piece of so-called chicken and some sprinkled chips. Pathetic beyond belief. This is why I hate chain restaurants. Come here to drink  eat elsewhere.
Robert W.,Patterson  CA,1652,145,847,1/15/2017,2.0,We arrived around 4 pm on a Saturday during the NFL playoffs. Surprisingly we were seated right away  thought there would be more people to watch the games. We sat at a table in the main dining area. About 5 minutes went by and no service. We realized that during playoff games they have happy hour specials  but in the bar area only. There was plenty of open seating in the bar so we moved. We were greeted right away and had the specials explained to us. During happy hour all draft beers are a dollar off and cocktails are $2 off. All appetizers  including the huge sampler are half off along with the mini deep dish pizzas.To start  we ordered drinks. Our first two beer choices were not available because they were out. My wife's second beer choice was also not available because they were out as well. We ordered the large appetizer sampler which comes with avocado egg rolls  chips and artichoke dip  BBQ boneless wings and cheese sticks. That was enough to feed us right there. Didn't realize how big it would be  we ordered 3 mini pizzas as well. The mini pizza is nowhere near as good as a larger deep dish. They were a little over cooked and minimal toppings. Overall  this is the worst Bj's I've been too.
Mark G.,Fremont  CA,94,160,115,7/17/2017,4.0,This is like any other BJ's. The food is all the same from place to place. The food is generally good. The servers are always what makes or breaks your dining experience. Call ahead and watch the bar to see if you can swoop on seats.This past time we were here we had Jose as a server at the bar. He was fantastic and was quite personable. He made sure that we had everything we needed/wanted. At the same time he was just an overall cool guy to talk to. He was efficient  which is the main thing I care about when dining. I drank the stout that was only there for a limited time. It was fantastic. What I also like about what this company is trying to do is that they are trying to have different types of whiskeys. They are branching out from the normal  my fiancee got angel's envy in the past and today a whiskey she has had in the past that I forget the name.I have had experiences where the service stunk. We waited due to the server or the food took forever. The drinks also depend on who is making them  so the bartender at the time. Overall you will have a good experience depending on the server and how efficiently everything else is running. Pending that  this Bj's is good. Its really a flip of the coin.
Diann U.,East Bay  CA,371,175,1077,6/29/2017,4.0,Usually go here for late dinners with the bf or fam. I really love their steak  I think it was the rib eye steak or something. But yes very filling and delicious!!! I also like their stuffed mushrooms :) Best times to go is late like 9ish during the weekday not crowded that much and can be seated right away depending on how many is in your party.
Mike T.,Los Angeles  CA,7,148,13,10/2/2017,1.0,"This is another of those places that are absolutely horrible  in terms of service. I asked what size of beer they have.. They told me the only have 16oz..alright..not according to the menu.. Then I asked for bread.. No bread. Then we asked for a pizza with light sauce.. They told me is not possible because it is ""embedded"" already in the though.So bottom line  frozen food all the way."
Nicole G.,Union City  CA,172,312,466,12/30/2016,4.0,Standard chain restaurant.. you know what you're getting. This location is always busy due to the limited selection of the TriCity area and/or game night.The menu is large  but has been condensed. We were lucky to get a table at the end of the bar. The only thing I did not like was the servers and staff cut through that section which is small and my food is right there. The margarita pizza was good  but the ahi salad was even better. I would recommend the salad if you have not tried it.
Adrian G.,Hayward  CA,410,37,2,11/21/2017,3.0,In terms of this place in general it meets the requirements. Came for pizookies and wine everything came out delicious but I have to say the service was below par  never want to be that guy but we did wait 45 minutes which was a bit off putting given another 15 minute wait for the check  they were having a real hectic night I'm assuming this isn't something that happens a lot place is kept well together!
Angela C.,Union City  CA,12,14,5,5/23/2017,1.0,On Sunday 5/21 around 6pm. my husband and I went to the Newark  Ca location to have dinner. My husband ordered a small pizza  pepperoni extreme I believe. We weren't given plates or utensils so when the food arrived he was just gonna eat it from the pan. When he took a slice what looked like a glob of cheese fell from the slice. At closer inspection  we realized it was some sort of condom or finger protector. We were absolutely horrified and disgusted!For one  this is extremely unsanitary! Condom or not  it didn't belong on the pizza and is just plain dirty. Who knows what type of bodily fluid was on it. Semen  blood  sweat  puss?? Who knows!?! And two  this could have been a huge chokinghazard! Good think my little niece wasn't with us.The manager came out and was absolutely speechless. He said he'd look into it. We never found out what it really was or how it got there. You can't tell me as an employee  you won't notice that your finger protector went missing?? Especially while working with food??? Not that I'm a person that tries to get stuff for free. I have a job and make money to buy my own things but we were only comped for the contaminated pizza. It was such a horrible and traumatizing experience. They remade the pizza which my husband agreed to. Personally I wouldn't have eaten it.I want to make sure that this incident is really taken seriously! I want to know that it really was investigated. Are the employees properly trained in food handling??? Is it a disgruntled employee??? Should health and safety or food inspectors be contacted or sent to this location??? I was in shock at first and just laughed it off. But after the shock wore off  it really pissed me off. I don't think I could ever eat at this location again.
Julia L.,East Bay  CA,505,278,573,11/17/2016,3.0,I came here with a small group on a late Saturday night to grab some appetizers and drinks. I wasn't surprised that it was busy  but luckily we didn't have to wait long since we opted for the bar. My party and I ordered wings  fried calamari and a deep dish pizza  all of which didn't blow me away. Drink wise  I ordered the Irish Root Beer. It was really good. You couldn't taste the alcohol at all  making it very dangerous.Overall  I'm not highly impressed with this BJ's  but at the same time I didn't have high expectations anyway. Food and drinks are average. Service was extremely welcoming  but delayed. I like how BJ's offers an extensive menu and I like this location  but honestly I am not interested in returning anytime soon.
Carlos C.,Jardim San Leandro  Brazil,16,2,,11/23/2017,2.0,Nice place if you like cold half baked potatoes and unchewable asparagus. Long wait for meals to come out. Service was great.
Joseph S.,San Jose  CA,113,1280,2342,6/21/2017,3.0,More like a 3.5 star. The beer selection is the highlight of the place  from Blond to Stout  from Brown to Red  and everything in the middle  I can't get enough of it. The food  is just ok  we ordered the Sriracha Dry Rub boneless chicken and Hot and Spicy Buffalo boneless wings. Well  the Dry  the Rub and boneless are there  but I have no idea where the Sriracha is  it is just chicken nuggets. The Hot and Spicy is really just chicken nuggets with Tabasco sauce. Service is great. Overall  standard chain restaurants  good place to meet with a group  but nothing special.
Katie C.,Milpitas  CA,192,97,32,6/3/2017,5.0,"TLDR; Based on the reviews below  I think we just got super lucky with the service and food!Service: Friday nights seem to be super busy here but we still got awesome service! The food came out super quickly. The waitress came to check up on us very often and she was very friendly and helpful.Food:Omg the guac burger was AMAZING. The fries were amazing and crisp. I couldn\'t fit the burger in my mouth at all. I will definitely order this burger again! If you buy soda  definitely try their root beer! Sweet  but with undertones of vanilla and ""i dont know what but it tastes good""."
Vineet J.,Redwood City  CA,50,41,14,11/5/2017,1.0,I waited 14 minutes from when I sat down to when I left but no one came to my table to take my order or offer me water. I asked a waiter to call my server  and he said he would- but instead he and 4 other waiters started talking and splitting tips in a corner for more than 10 min. Note that this was 4 pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was not busy. I will not be coming here again.
Kamiya M.,Sunnyvale  CA,193,58,22,9/21/2017,4.0,Love the pizookie there  along with the jambalaya.Their Vanilla Cream Soda is a must try if you have not tried it before.It's my favorite late night hangout place as it is open quite late on weekdays as well.The ambience is pretty cool too !
Vikash S.,Fremont  CA,2,28,6,9/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Duty manager on Sunday get 5 star he just turned the bitter experience into a smile. We will comeBack again. Thank you again
Alice L.,Fremont  CA,156,11,6,5/4/2017,3.0,Came here for BOGO free entrees on a Thursday night and it was decently full  but we got seated right away.Food: I got a full rack of ribs  with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes as my sides. The ribs were a bit dry and over salted  but the sides were pretty good. I also got a peach iced tea  but it tasted like Lipton instant tea and barely flavored.Service: Our server was very nice  but forgot to bring my drink for ~45 mins. We tried to get her attention  but she must have had too many tables to watch over since she was walking very fast and passed us a couple times. Would come here for the weekdays specials and deals  but probably wouldn't come for full priced entrees.
Janet D.,San Jose  CA,104,1213,1378,3/29/2017,3.0,Just came here for their Monday 50% off of large pizza specials and am so sad I did. The quality of the pizza was way below average and it was super super greasy. I am sorry I decided to save myself some money and went that route. Will not be back for this pizza special again. And the pizza was super salty. Sad panda!
Mars S.,Fremont  CA,905,386,275,3/21/2017,2.0,I don't know what it is about BJ's. I've definitely had a handful of enjoyable times at the restaurant  but at the same time  I've also had an equal number of less than satisfactory visits. Although their food is better than Applebee's and Chili's  BJ's has never wowed me and can overall be completely hit or miss. Sometimes  I'm 100% happy with my meal  while other times it's just completely off. For example  once I ordered the ahi tuna appetizer and it was pitiful  coming out with 3 pieces of avocado instead of having it piled on like the menu's picture. Another time my friend ordered the sante fe salad and replaced the chicken with salmon as she does not eat meat. The salad came out with both salmon and chicken which was odd  and she ended up having to send it back to the kitchen.In terms of service  again  I've had an equal number of visits that it's been just fine and other times where it's been awfully slow. Overall  for the price  inconsistency with food/service  and the always ridiculous wait times  BJ's is not the place I'd suggest going with a friend given all the amazing new restaurants that are popping up in Fremont/Newark.Additional things worth mentioning:- Lots of cool beer options. I'd suggest taking a seat at the bar with a couple of friends instead of indulging in a full dine-in meal with a larger party as that's where BJ's tends to mess up more.- Huge parking lot  but it's always really full. Make sure to not leave valuables in the car as it's an area that's targeted. Thankfully  they have security guards now  but better be safe than sorry.
Khang N.,Foster City  CA,43,5,,8/26/2017,2.0,The beer is good. That's about it. Everything else sucked. We ordered their Nashville hot and their brunch egg combo. Their sweet potato fries were cold and hard. Their sunny side up eggs were eclipse from even being decent with old potato hash. Go to Country Way just down the street. The food is infinitely better with real bacon  not whimsy limp ones here.
Tarcisio G.,Eastside  Las Vegas  NV,15,40,12,9/28/2017,4.0,Love this place! I come here to have a beer and appetizers. Tonight I did not like that there was people waiting around for tables and some employees had a glass of water on one table simulating busy table for themselves and their friends while still wearing bjs uniforms. Our waiter was the best.. friendly and quick to respond to our needs.
Nick S.,Thousand Oaks  CA,28,128,12,8/4/2017,1.0,Went here with family yesterday. Knew there wasn't a lot of vegan options but that's fine. Asked for pasta with tomato sauce said no meat no cheese. Arrived covered in Parmesan cheese and I said is that cheese I asked for no meat no cheese. Guy says yeah it's cheese. I said again that I asked for no meat and no cheese and he then asked if I wanted him to take it back. I said yes. 5 minutes later the manager came out to let me know that the meatballs have Parmesan in them  I tell him I just want noodles and tomato sauce  no cheese  no meat. Dish comes back out 10 minutes later and silently put down. Giant roll covered in butter on top. I don't mind that there's few vegan options I don't expect every restaurant to have good choices but I don't understand when my order is wrong and they act like it's my fault.
Nataly G.,Union City  CA,2,142,74,3/28/2017,4.0,My family and I come here on occasion  mostly Sundays. What's cool is that there is a mall across the street that has an AMC so it's pretty convenient! It does get a bit crowded sometimes if you go later on in the afternoon. My all time favorite dish is the 5 meats pizza  it comes in the pan(dish?) that it was cooked in and all pizzas come like this so the pizza is fresh and hot! The crust is amazing it's fluffy yet crunchy and flavorful and the toppings are awesome! We usually get pizza when we come because it's always a hit! However this last time my dad got a burger and couldn't finish it because he said the meat tasted off and was cold. So we defiantly recommend ordering pizza!The staff never seems to be in a good mood so that's why I unfortunately docked off a star  they're slow to take your order  never get you refills and the hostess can often times be grumpy.
Brandon D.,San Lorenzo  CA,197,90,197,5/29/2017,4.0,BJs is the place to be at! It's definitely always going to be busy here  but you've got to know the right time to go. I came here for my birthday and decided I'd also try my luck coming during dinner hours. Got here around 7 PM and it was definitely packed. I came with a party of 2  so that definitely helped things along. The wait was only about ~20 minutes  so it definitely wasn't as bad of a wait that I bet other people had to wait for. There's plenty of seating available at this location. If you're looking for some good ol' fashioned American foods  you've come to the right place! They've got pretty much any sort of food you can think of. They've got salads  pizzas  burgers  fries  ribs  steaks  drinks. The list goes on and on  if you can think of it  BJs probably serves it. If she's working during the time you're there  I highly recommend asking for April. She's kind  patient  funny  and all around awesome! I decided to get a drink to start off my meal  and started with the fried calamari as an appetizer. Because it was pretty busy  I expected the entrees to come a little while after so to have some time to enjoy the appetizer. To my surprise  the entrees came out right away! We got burgers and the steak special. All that came out  you can say  pretty much with the appetizers  so we had a ton of food to eat at the same time! Everything was very flavorful and juicy. Despite how busy it was for dinner time  my food was cooked perfectly  medium rare quality and everything came out in a timely manner. When it came down to dessert  we of course got the pizookies! Since it was my birthday too  we were able to get a mini pizookie on the house! We were able to try and mix and match flavors which is awesome when you love sweets and desserts but can't seem to choose exactly the dessert flavors you want!Service was awesome  especially during the busy hours. April  our server  was awesome! She was especially patient when it came to making the crucial decision of what to have for dessert. Not only that  she was also patient and had recommendations when it came to what flavors to get in terms of pizookies. All the food was cooked beautifully and filled with flavor. Will definitely come again to enjoy the good foods with good company! Definitely come to BJs!
Joey V.,San Diego  CA,105,95,56,5/11/2017,5.0,Came here twice The first time Cassandra our sever made my party feel unwelcome. She took forever to take our orders and to bring our drinks. We receivers our appetizer but gave us small plates when we were already more than half way done with it. We asked for a straw for our drinks and she never came back after she acknowledged that she was going to get us some.The second time April was our server and changed my whole perspective about their customer service. She made it fun and did not make my party feel ignored. She is the best server I've had at this restaurant. I was hesitant to give this place no stars because of my first incident here with Cassandra but April made it so much better. Give this girl a raise because she deserves it.
Celena Z.,Union City  CA,5,24,32,7/25/2017,4.0,Just ended my day by coming to Bj's. Ordered a calamari appetizer and was a little disappointed on how much I paid for the calamari and how little I got. The Oreo pizookie is to die for! I think it's the best out of all of them.But overall  Michael our server was super friendly and did a great job.
Sarah L.,Union City  CA,288,100,408,7/15/2017,4.0,My husband and I went here on a Friday night for date night. You have to be prepared to roam the parking lot for days just to find a spot.. We ended up parking by the gas station across the street.. I think it's the Overflow parking lot.? After all that once we got in the weight time was ridiculous.. but expected on a Friday night! Luckily there was bar seating open and we were able to sit right away! (Bar seating available first-come first-serve which includes high top tables) we were greeted by the server who was very pleasant. I ordered the classic burger with french fries and my husband ordered the mahi mahi tacos (fried). When our food came it was PERFECT!MY BURGER WAS SO JUICY AND HAD A GREAT CHAR ON THE OUTSIDE! The Buns had a great toast on the inside and had a nice gloss on top. The french fries were perfectly fried and had a great crunch as well. The mahi-mahi tacos were also made perfectly! It was fried but NOT dry and was nice and flaky. Great flavors BUT the green stuff I think it was a guacamole sauce . It tasted a bit funny almost over ripe? It was also nice that the manager stopped by to see how everything was. No complaints here except for the parking lol We would definitely come back!
Samina M.,Fremont  CA,8,1,,9/23/2017,2.0,We have been to Newark bj's multiple time  the food and service is always good  yesterday it was my son's birthday and he picked bj's.Our host was good she was very friendly that is why I added 1 star but the food was not good we ordered 2 app sets of calamari it was very salty and overly battered and seems like was fried in an old oil our main dishes was not as expected also we ordered jalapeo burger and it was totally burnt but last we ordered birthday pazooki ice cream the cookie was very doughy it was under cooked so basically bj's ruined my son's birthday we walked out unhappy.
Learnee L.,Emeryville  CA,39,658,86,3/22/2017,4.0,I'm never a fan of franchise restaurants and I've had bad food experience from other BJ locations so I wasn't looking forward to going with my girls to this place. Came in Tuesday for early dinner and d place is crowded. Parking area close to d entrance is full but thank God for more parking spots on d other side closer to d gas station.We were a group of 9 but we were able to get seats right away.Service was good.Food came in pretty quick. I ordered the super salad and it was great. The pizookie was on sale that night so all my girls got one. I unfortunately am cutting on sugar so I opted to skip it.Big screens to watch sports. Bar was hustlin but wasn't packed. Restroom was clean. I'll give it a 4 star.
Kathy T.,Hayward  CA,205,99,129,4/18/2017,4.0,"BJ\'s is one of my favorite places to get ""American food""- I think that\'s the best way to explain it? I go here a lot because like I said  it\'s one of my FAVS! APPETIZERS:-Stuffed mushrooms: 4/5I have no clue what goes inside these little mushroom but it tastes amazing! Perfect combo of crunch with softness. Only reason not 5/5 is the price. You only get 5-6 mushroom for about $13. I only get these when I\'m balling! -Calamari: 4/5 I love that BJ\'s give two dipping options for their calamari  fav is the white sauce! Calamari here has the perfect crunch. Same reason for it not being 5/5.... why is it so expensive! Such a small plate for basically the same price as an entree. -Avocado egg rolls: 3/5 My boyfriend loves these but I\'m not the biggest fan. I think it\'s too much avocado? I\'m also not a huge fan of the Asian like sauce  reminds me of sweet and sour. Of everyone I know  I\'m probably the only one that isn\'t a huge fan of these egg rolls. -Chicken tortilla soup: 5/5Hands down my absolute favorite tortilla soup  EVER! I\'m serious! I love those soup  I\'ve tried chicken tortilla soup at many other places  nothing fulfills my craving like BJ\'s!ENTREES: -Blacken Atlantic salmon: 5/5My favorite! I have no idea how they do it! It has the perfect taste and the sauce that comes on the salmon  delicious! Comes with rice and steamed veggies  great combo.-Chicken Parmesan: 5/5 Usually this plate comes with red sauce. I\'m not a fan or red sauce (marinara) but at bj\'s it\'s a delicious lemon white sauce! I order extra of that! AMAZING! The chicken is nice and crunchy with the amazing sauce poured over it. Side of mash potatoes and broccoli....... YUMMERS! DESSERTS: -Bizzokie aka Huge cookies! 6/5 Cookies and cream is my favorite. But so far whatever I tried is still pretty good as well! BEERS:They have ""brew house"" in their name  meaning their beers should be good. I agree with that fact! I enjoy their Hefes and blonds. I like their berry cider but I DO NOT like their pear cider.... taste like cleaning appliances. TIPS- if you know you\'re coming out name down on their app! Worth it! Also  on your birthday they give you a free mini bizzoki! :)"
Danae L.,Fremont  CA,361,423,79,4/17/2017,3.0,I don't think they have happy hour  but regardless it's still a great place or small bites and drinks. I came on a Saturday night with friends and there was a 50 minute wait. We started started with a few alcoholic drinks and calamari. I wish the calamari was served in smaller bits and slightly crispier.I ordered the shrimp tacos with tortilla chips. I asked for nothing spicy but still received salsa that was too much to handle. There was barely enough tortilla chips and insufficient shrimp in my tacos. The waiter was probably new because she had a hard time working their system.
Stanley Y.,Union City  CA,306,156,51,8/23/2016,2.0,The menu is too large for their own good. About half of it is actually edible. Certain dishes are amazing  some are pretty good  and others taste worse overcooked boiled chicken. I think people just come here for the decor  ambiance  and pizookies. If you come here  stick to burgers  pizzas  drinks  and pizookies (they would 5 stars if they stuck to those).Skip appetizers if you're not that hungry. I ordered the Late Night Burger. It was pretty good  but my medium rare came out well done... almost too well. The burger would have been slightly dry if I didn't add generous amounts of hot sauce. I know it says its an open faced burger  but do you really have to but the patty halfway on each bun? Presentation was underwhelming since the over easy egg was too wide and covered everything else. Fries were okay and tasted a bit stale like they sat in the kitchen window a bit too long. Pizza is always a safe bet.Do not get any of the pasta or rice dishes. Pasta is under-seasoned every time. Jambalaya is an exorbitant $17 but isn't even close to authentic and was way too salty.Pizookies! This is the best thing here. They have a supersized pizookie that is not on the menu. For $25  you'll get a giant half baked cookie the size of a large pizza with half a gallon of ice cream stacked on the center.Their alcoholic mixed drinks are pretty good. About $10 each.Service is usually good  but the waiter whose name starts with a K gave us the check way too early.
carlotta b.,Hayward  CA,17,5,3,11/6/2017,2.0,Take out is terrible I put the order in thirty minutes ago been waiting for ten minutes still no update and there's no one at the counter terrible service I say
Jim J.,Naperville  IL,25,57,,11/2/2017,2.0,The ambiance of this restaurant is nice  but the service is mediocre and the food falls way short. Came here for lunch  and started with the Avocado Eggrolls. They were kind of non-descript  with the texture consistency of baby food and flavor to match. Also had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad  which was rather limp  and had a weird mix of flavors that didn't really resemble chicken or barbecue. Both dishes were so over salted that the flavor essentially burned in my mouth. How do you screw up a salad? Not impressed!
Kia F.,San Jose  CA,3,125,12,6/21/2017,1.0,"We were here Tuesday night from 10:15pm until around 11:55pm  June 20  2017. Our server was Shea  and she was inattentive and served us in a hurry. She would come and leave with a quickness that was unbecoming of basic food service hospitality. She left me wondering if she even wanted to be there to ""take care of us"". No refills  she gave us the bare minimum version of checking-in and no ""sorry the food is taking a while"". She managed to drop off the bill with a sub-standard script and snatched it away without a word as soon as it was ready. She left the card and customer copy in the same swift  non-verbal way. To top it off  the fries were barely warm  we waited 40 minutes for the food and the steak was chewy. This was not a good night at BJs  Fremont. It wasn\'t even busy!Thanks  but we will remember to go somewhere else."
Ying Bo C.,Newark  CA,12,4,,10/1/2017,1.0,We noticed waiters wearing some type of tablet for ordering. My order was switched from Ziti to Chicken Alfredo. Wife's side order was wrong. They rushed my order out and under cooked the pasta. My wife's prime rib was not seasoned at all. She ate two bites and threw it away! That's $24 in the trash! So if you want to flush money down the drain  go to BJ's.
Sean C.,Fremont  CA,1008,1374,2124,6/20/2016,3.0,Nearly twenty-four hours after the Golden State Warriors loss (Game 7  2016 vs. Cleveland)  there should be an empty hole inside me. Thankfully  the BJ's deep dish filled up the void. With all the sports TV's  I couldn't have unassumingly picked a better place; every shoulder turn there's a new TV to look at. The staff must hate LeBron James because as soon as it cut to his post-game interview  they cut off the sound. LeBron is a true nemesis but I can't deep down not admire the guy; I could have listened to him for a couple minutes.You'd think as a Warriors fan I'd be all for the Golden Pilsners  but not quite. I almost never go without the Jeremiah Red Beer (toasty amber hue). And I never finish without doing a Pazookie (baked cookie with ice cream on top). This particular staff is almost rock solid. I only found one of the four hostesses a little airhead-y  but the waiters and waitresses like to think two steps ahead of the customers (except when it comes to the cheque; I'll wave anybody down after this much waiting post-Pazookie. Come on!) Good kid's menu. Good coloring book and crayons. Good iced water. Good beer (for me). Solid 3-stars  but there's upside here if you need sports TV viewing. SUBSEQUENT TRIP HERE: We ordered a pizza  pasta dish and pazookie dessert and they all came at the same time  that means  dripping ice cream on cookie when we're just trying to start on pizza. Idiotic. #likereally
Steve C.,Hayward  CA,10,19,23,1/16/2017,3.0,"I usually only review a place if it\'s a 1 or 5 star place. Either you had to be really mad enough to remember to write a review  or the experience went so well you feel compelled to shout your love to the world via Yelp reviews. Today\'s experience with BJ\'s was mainly an indulgence trip; I came literally for the chocolate chip pizookie. Like a genius  I decided to order the full size version with a glass of milk for just one: me. This experience definitely is best left in your mind. However I do think I won\'t be thinking about eating a whole pizookie ever again. Let\'s break this review down into sections: customers  environment  cleanliness  location  parking  food quality  service.Customers are standard of a family friendly restaurant. Some families are here  some couples  some old friends who deserve their own sitcom where they can sit-calm... I\'m punny. That\'s how we Filipinos say ""funny"". The environment is chill. Got some paintings on the wall and tvs with sports on them. Music is okay. Good enough to blend into any conversation without you really giving a crap about the music. Points docked for cleanliness. I arrived around 3pm so it\'s not too crowded  yet my table still had obvious residue. I do not want to lean my arms on the table. the seat was fine tho. This location is right off the freeway and near Newpark Mall so it\'s like Landmark status. Easy to find and the parking (at least for 3pm).FOOD QUALITY!!! Caps lock helps wake up the readers. The pizookie was too big for me to want to finish alone. This definitely requires 2 or more in my opinion. The flavor is good though. The outsides of the cookie are crispy with a gooey chocolatey center. So the cookie isn\'t fully cooked. It is crunchy outside and gooey inside. If this is what you like more power to you. The vanilla ice cream quality is okay too. You can see the vanilla beans in the ice cream. The milk is standard milk. SERVICE.... A bit slow. I can understand though because I am not the only person this waitress has to worry about. She helping lots of other people so I forgive the wait times. Midway through she had a dude named Mike come and replace her so she can take her lunch break. This guy is okay he is chill. I just wish he was around to ask for the check earlier than I found him. But it\'s okay I won\'t make a big deal out of it (says a Yelp reviewer; I cannot be trusted). I have given my thoughts on my rubric  but I have not had the chance to check out the bathroom. I usually enjoy describing a restaurant\'s restroom because a clean restroom shows a restaurant has pride and good work ethics. Maybe I\'m just OCD idk. WHY THREE STARS THO? YOU ENJOYED THE COOKIE!!! The main reasons were service  wait time  cleanliness and price. For a glass of milk and the pizookie full size its 10.32 and a 15% tip is 1.42 making the total $11.74 which is a bit much for only being able to finish half of the pizookie. Maybe even less than half. I feel a bit jipped off at least for what I paid. Then again the server did say they had a mini pizookie for like $3.XX I should have just gone for that one. The service was good enough  but no efforts to make me feel ""special"" or give me a memorable experience were attempted. Not sure how happy the workers are here. I don\'t blame them though  I hate customer service myself. Yelp is cool tho cuz I get to be that anal customer reviewing stuff lmao.I mentioned the table not being clean earlier  and the wait time was slightly longer than ideal. If I wanted to be nice I would rate this a 4 star  but trying to look at this review as corporately as possible they might rate itna 3 star. Personally I guess I would say it\'s a 4 star  but I\'m trying to give an unbiased opinion. That was my review you made it this far and you deserve something great like 10% off your next BJs visit or something. Unfortunately I cannot grant that request so I hope my thanks is good enough.Thank you for reading this review  see ya next time!Steve CarneyAmatuer Yelp Critic"
Saachi G.,Fremont  CA,450,207,3025,1/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Adding a star for the great service we received last night. I was able to put our group on the preferred wait list so when we arrived we were immediately seated. We asked for a booth and were given one. Our server Jonathan was very helpful all night  a step up from service we have had in the past. He was very quick to bring our beers/drinks throughout our meal  which I really appreciated. Also  a big thank you to the manager for sorting out a bit of a coupon mishap we had. You and Jonathan definitely improved our experience as loyal customers at BJ's. Thank you for a great night.
Bradley H.,San Jose  CA,450,389,1,12/8/2016,4.0,I really enjoy this place!The environment is always upbeat  they always have a good selection of drinks on draft (well  it is a brewery of course)  lots of TV screens with a good selection of channels  friendly wait staff  and pretty decent food.Some of my favorites:Seared Ahi Salad--at times can be a little too acidic  but the avocado and the Ahi help to cut the acidity  and it is actually a pretty healthy salad (many salads at these bar places are worse for you than the burgers).All you can eat soup and salad lunch special--you can pick and choose from any combination od their soups and salads. They usually have some light soups  some creamy soups  and some hearty soups--perfect to go w their house  cesar  or wedge salads.Grilled Fish Tacos--only comes w two  but the serving size is actually quite filling along w the chips. I recommend the grilled fresher fish over the fried frozen fish.Avocado Egg Rolls--love these for an appetizer. If I am w a slightly larger group  I like the sampler that gives a bit of everything for everyone to try without spoiling the meal.Happy eating!
James W.,San Bruno  CA,1,3,,10/15/2017,1.0,Please don't allow customers to order online through this app and then cancel because you don't deliver. Very frustrating and misleading.
Christian C.,Union City  CA,309,73,12,5/23/2017,1.0,My sister and her husband were there this past weekend  ordered a pizza and received more toppings than they liked. When the pizza came out it appeared to have a huge chunk of cheese but at first it appeared to be a condom on top of the pizza  but it turned out to be a finger condom to cover up cuts and bandaids. None the less pretty gross  it's basically like finding a bandaid. I would be cautioned until the kitchen issues are resolved  my head chef would never let anything but food be served.
Sheila C.,Union City  CA,137,297,495,12/7/2016,2.0,Who goes to BJ's and doesn't get a pizookie?! I always try and save some space for dessert! There's a couple different kinds of pizzokie's you can get. There's also a trio but they're mini sized so they're good for first timers! I've never really been a fan of BJ's. It's always too crowded even during the weekdays. Parking is something they need to really improve on. There's a ton of parking on the other side of BJ's but it's an inconvenience and during the weekends  that area can also get pretty packed. The food isn't all that great. I used to love coming here only for their deep dish stuffed raviolis but they don't have it anymore :( they were so delicious! What's really shocking about BJ's is that they microwave all their stuff including chicken and all. I honestly thought they were freshly made. Don't think I'd come back again unless it was some kind of event.
Melissa Nicole N.,Newark  CA,357,94,193,11/14/2016,2.0,Great appetizers and beer! My BF and I shared the ahi poke appetizer and a pitcher of Jeremiah Red  super yummy! It's a shame that my experience was great here... but what I saw can never be unseen!!!!! I saw the bartender make some sort of strawberry drink. After she shook the drink  she looked at the drink with big eyes and pulled out a set of keys...crazy right?! Then instead of throwing it out and making a new one... she added more ice then sent it off with a waiter!! Because of this I stared her down while she filled up our pitcher! I am NOT taking chances!!! Such a shame because I grew up eating here and it makes me wonder if I have ever been treated like that before  hopefully not! ):
d s.,Orange County  CA,58,82,7,7/22/2017,3.0,We had the chicken lettuce wrap  Deep Dish California and Mediterranean pizza  Monkey Bread dessert.Chicken lettuce wraps were really bad. They add alot of mushrooms  celery  chestnuts all topped with chips. Shredded carrots on the side with 2 sauces  horse radish and the other I couldnt tell. The whole dish tasted like a bad attempt to make Chinese chicken at home with extra salt. Gross. -1And they did not give seperate plates for the appetizer  which is defintely short sightedness with the given appetizer. -1Pizza was better - Mediterranean is always good. California supreme was just okay. Next time we will stick to BJs favorite and Mediterranean. +1Dessert - Monkey Bread with ice cream. Its like a moist cinnabon with ice cream. +1The food was prompt  despite it being full at 2pm on a Saturday. +1
Tara K.,Fremont  CA,0,27,1,8/17/2017,4.0,BJ's hasn't let me down when it comes to great tasting food. I've tried a variety of their items: burgers  salads  pizookie  fish n chips  deep dish pizza  seafood  steak; they were all excellent! I love/hate that they have so many options  especially if you can't make up your mind about what you want! They truly have enough variety to satisfy any diet  so anyone complaining about that is just being picky.The atmosphere is great: pretty chill  clean  decent noise volume  space between your table and the next one over  and TVs on different stations. It's definitely my go-to place when it comes to grabbing quality lunch or dinner. If you eat here regularly  the rewards program is a bonus. It's always great getting credit towards your bill or a free item (we redeemed a triple chocolate mini pizookie with chocolate ice cream on it and OH. MY. GOD. Delicious and I hate chocolate.) -- if you have enough points.The staff is all right. The host/hostess at the front can sometimes be unenthused  which is weird since it's the first face you typically see when entering the restaurant. The waitstaff is somewhat attentive. I think they could work on watching drinks more. Often  it's a good 10 minutes before they notice an empty cup on the table and then another 5-ish for them to bring a refill. All in all  I haven't experienced anyone who is rude or negative in any way.
Jessica R.,Union City  CA,163,130,119,5/10/2017,3.0,Been here many times and the food is the usual American menu. Food is alright. Sometimes it comes out cold. Pastas  burgers  pizzas  beer  liquor  etc. the only thing I think people actually go here for is the pazookies. Those are bomb.com if you have a sweet tooth. Calamari is delicious  nicely crispy! Service is usually pretty good when I come here so can't complain about that. Come here if you want dessert or some drinks.
Pavle R.,San Francisco  CA,0,32,,10/12/2017,2.0,This is a lush house  and the food leaves something to be desired. I had the sweet potato fries  sliders  cauliflower  Brussel sprouts and a mini pizza. All were pretty overcooked  over-seasoned and unattractive. The sliders looked the worst and served on a bed of crappy lettuce mixed in with my fries. Ugh! Nasty. Not recommended for the food. The beer was a good selection and the service staff were nice  but the food... Ugh.
Thanh N.,San Francisco  CA,11,22,6,11/17/2017,2.0,Customer service is alright  food variety isnt as exciting as it used to be  now food orders are horrible. The few times i decided to grab food from Bjs and probably 3/5 times there super late. I ordered about an hour ahead each time  deciding to pick them up after some errands  and a few times i ended up getting my food AN HOUR later. Very disappointed. Food is good though  but sometimes they mess up up the order like forgetting to add chicken to my foos  or forgetting the sides
Michelle D.,San Jose  CA,15,93,13,6/21/2017,2.0,Typical chain restaurant- mediocre food and mediocre service. The waitress seemed like we were bothering her or something. It also took forever to get our check. The food was lukewarm and displayed messy and was not appetizing at all.
Marshal R.,Fremont  CA,106,235,27,11/19/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I want to love BJ's  I really do but within the last 2 years there's been so many issues. It almost doesn't even seem like it's this location. I've gone to other locations and experience the same kind of service and food issues.4 out of my last 5 visits we've had trouble even getting a table. They'd give us a buzzer and then 45 mins later we have to inquire about where we were in line just to come and find out that they supposedly called for us but the buzzer didn't go off (we were at the bar while waiting).And many more cases like this.The wait staff is VERY hit or miss (at every location I've been to). The food comes out in a weird order at times  like getting your appetizer with your entree (what?). Kind of defeats the purpose of an appetizer.Reason for keeping it a 3*** is because the beer is always good. And like I said  some times you get a good waiter.... some times....
Laverne A.,Daly City  CA,0,36,38,2/25/2017,1.0,Before you read  could BJ's please give some recognition to our waitresses April. She was awesome. Well  as most of the Yelpers on here talking about the host check in. That would also explain the 1 star. Come on BJ's invest some money into training these folks. They are front and center of your business. Such a shame. Here's the email I sent corporate: I put my party on the priority wait list. Upon check in was told that it was only 15 minutes. Checked in the 3 times with desk and lady kept saying we were next after we saw all these other people getting checked in. Finally had it and stood in front of lady until we were called to be seated. Waitresses  very nice lady named April took our order. Appetizers came out. Ordered stuffed mushrooms and a quarter was larger than the size of the mushroom. I have photos. Also ordered top sirloin with asparagus and mashed potatoes  asparagus ends not trimmed and still had dirt ends. I also have photos. Mashed potatoes  cold in the center. Told our waitresses but situation was beyond repair and completely frustrating. I will not be returning to any BJ's nor will I have my company have any functions there until this is addressed.
Al G.,Newark  CA,43,37,15,8/20/2017,1.0,"Okay... we eat here all the time and really never had any problems  until today. Our party of 6 entered the restaurant and there were 4 female individuals at the front desk. They were engaged in personal conversations with one of them slouched and leaning on he counter. We all walked up to them and they just looked at us. No hi  hello or any kind of welcome greeting. The only words from one of them was  ""6? How many kids?"" I said two kids and no response. Didnt say have a seat  over this way  we\'ll have your table ready in a moment  etc."" we all just stood there in front of them and looked at each other in confusion while we listened to the staff with their personal conversations. Then after a minute  one of them took us to a table for four. She pulled out the 6in extension and gathered chairs from another table to fit 6. I asked her if a booth was available and she said no. I said  we can wait for a booth if we have to because we wont fit 6 in a table designed for 4. And we are asian  so that was how small the table was. Anyways  the hostess had a solution* Put my 5yo in a high chair so it would save some space. Which i replied no  he wont fit in a high chair idiot. He is too big. Absurd solution. So I told her  there is no way you can fit 6 ppl on a table for 4. So there are two options for you. So i told her two things. We can wait for a booth or we can eat somewhere else. Her response was  ""Well  it might be awhile for a booth."" I just told you we would wait. Geez! So I told her never mind and that we would eat somewhere else that has common sense and respect. I spoke to the manager and explained all this to him  as he looked at his 4-5 hostesses at the front  standing there doing nothing. He tried to keep us there and he didnt seem happy about what he was hearing from me and apologize. I explained to him that i just wanted to give him the feedback and how he addresses it with his staff  is his job. Unfortunate because i like their food. But we wont be going back for awhile. They were not busy at all. 1/2 the place was empty. So we are here at Jack\'s  waiting to be seated. But we were greeted with a smile when we walked in and handed a pager and also told the approximate wait time. Just as any restaurant would. I"
Phil P.,Schaumburg  IL,52,170,,12/20/2016,5.0,After checking in at our hotel down the street  my colleague and I wandered into BJ's for a late lunch. We opted to sit at the high-tops in the bar area and were promptly greeted by our server (can't remember his name). He gave us a few minutes to look over the menu  which is huge BTW  while he went to get our iced teas.I settled on the Salmon and Quinoa bowl  and my colleague had the grilled chicken. Both of our entrees were awesome in size  quality  and flavor. We left completely satisfied!
Michael B.,Los Gatos  CA,0,24,11,5/28/2017,1.0,I got there at 12:44 and checked in. Waiting for my fianc got a kid who was in training who got me and her both water with lemon. My fianc came in at 1:14. We placed our order at 1:20  in the back room was a graduation party going on. Which I believe is why the line was taking so long. Even the manager was bringing out the food walking right by us. We tried to get him to stop  but no go. And instead of anyone having the decency to say hat the kitchen is backed up  your order may take a minute or two longer. Instead nothing was said to us. We ordered two different salads. But by 1:54 with a thirty minute wait for salad we got up and left.If you know you have a party ahead of time set yourself up for success verses pissing off a valued customer. We used to dine with your company all the time but the last few visits have left us wanting. Not a place to return for awhile. If at all.
Lauren F.,Wilsonville  OR,398,379,583,9/29/2016,2.0,Great location | Food  menu is good | Service isn't great$$We went with my parents to have a late dinner and dessert at this BJ's. Usually we go to the BJ's in our area  Santa Rosa  when my parents come to visit. We weren't very happy with our experience here. The location is good  it's next to the freeway  across from a major mall  and it has ample parking. Gas station is next to it too. Food and menu is pretty consistent since this is a chain. Sometime you'd be surprised though  but this time we didn't have anything to complain about. It was the service that earned a 2-star review. Shaen introduced herself and things were good. But throughout the time of dining there  it just got more weird and strained...She wasn't as attentive as she could've been. Like  she'd check up on us  but my mom had to ask for extra sauce a couple of times  and when Shaen gave extra sauce  it wasn't the right one. I understand it gets busy during weekends  but it's a tad bit weird if you hand us the check when we're finishing up our meal and haven't even received our dessert yet. (We had already put in our order for dessert too.) I think at that point she just wanted to be done with us.I mean  doesn't that make you feel rushed to finish? So  from the middle of our dining to handing back the credit card  there was this really strained interaction and feeling like 'ugh  I want to be done with you.'Would I come back here again? Probably not. It's not the worse  but it's certainly not the best. It was out of convenience we went because they were open late.
Miguel B.,San Jose  CA,78,8,4,9/22/2017,1.0,Prob one of the worst... host attitude is just atrocious. 1.5 he wait with over 10 tables available for 2... wow! Good job keeping me as a customer.
Carolina F.,San Lorenzo  CA,88,17,1,7/27/2017,2.0,Went in on a Wednesday night and my boyfriend and I both order the exact same thing. Steak (medium well) and sweet potatoes fries. My boyfriend steak came out perfect and mines was so over cooked and super dry. The server took it back and came back with another steak. The steak was bloody af !!! The cooks were just mocking me!!! I felt so bad for the server but he came back with the same last steak that was bloody but it was just cooked more. I've kept apologizing I felt so bad for him. At the end he gave us the check and I wrote a note and said the cooks need to learn how to cook steak and the sweet potato fries were old. The server is the only reason why my rate even got 2 stars. It should of really got 0. I think the manger should of came to talk to me to make sure I was satisfied. If the manger would of came I would of never wrote a bad review.
Manny G.,Union City  CA,137,567,686,4/7/2017,3.0,Was not expecting much as I have been here before although decided to stop in after an event. We had asked for a couple of beers only to find out they did not have those bottles tonight. Food was just ok  We had the triple Decker club sandwich which I had asked them to hold the Mayo and sure enough that request went unnoticed. Server was on a break and the back up server did not come around so I scraped off the mayo myself. We also had the bison burger and it was quite plain. We did manage to score seating at the bar that was a plus. I received the level of service and quality of food I had expected. It seems that there is always a challenge in finding parking in the crowded lot.
Danielle M.,Woodland Hills  CA,112,54,25,2/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"I\'ve been to Bjs many times  this location twice. Ordered the wedge salad every time I have come  and it never had parsley on it ! This time it was loaded with it . So I sent it back . Bartender Anthony was super cool about it   didn\'t care . Then the manager brandy came out and pretty much told me that next time I order a salad   I should specify that I don\'t want parsley. (Ok first of all how am I supposed to know it even comes on it if it doesn\'t mention it in the ingredients on the menu) it was just the fact that she went out of her way to come and say that to us  it was just a turn off . And then made it a point to say ""I\'m not tryna argue with you"" no one was arguing we were just taken off guard by the fact she came out in the first place. And lastly wedge salads DO NOT have parsley on them so why I should I have to specify this??? Luckily for the fact that I was starving  the friendly guests and sweet bartender I stayed.Update ::::Just made a pick up order and came to realize that our avocado eggrolls were missing and when we called to verify a lady on the phone was very rude and condescending to us. Then I asked for her name and guess who it was... Brandy the same person that was rude the first time we came here! This Brandy lady should not be working in the food service industry because she has a unnecessary attitude."
Sowmya S.,San Mateo  CA,114,113,484,3/18/2016,4.0,Huge quantities of food! This place was a surprise for us - we didn't expect it to be that big and nice looking! I actually loved the high ceilings  the cute chandeliers and the decor! The lady who attended for us was very nice and friendly. She patiently helped me pick a 'sweet' cocktail. We ordered a buffalo chicken grilled sandwich and a shrimp asparagus penne and they were both very flavorful and tasty. We couldn't finish the pasta  it was huge! There is a lot of parking available although I heard it's usually full. One thing I didn't like was all other BJs in other places could be reserved using open table but this Newark BJ's never showed up! Too bad!
Loretta S.,Fremont  CA,0,63,24,9/9/2017,5.0,We love BJ's!We always have a fantastic time  and the foods and atmosphere are wonderful!B&L SylviaFremont  CA
Suki M.,Fremont  CA,27,139,549,4/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Went back to BJ's for a quick bite after a long absence  ate in the bar area which is our M.O. since we like to watch sports  service was on point food was good for a bar & grille pizza and cauliflower tacos... the tacos are soooo good I hope they keep em!! But what happened to the wedge cut fries??!!!!! Why O Why would you get rid of them?!!!
Jeremy S.,Dallas  TX,0,4,,2/26/2017,1.0,Avoid that place. The worst restaurant I have been in the past 10 years.The food is horrible  and the service a joke.We were a group of 30 people  took 45 mins to get a drink.Run away  as fast as you can.
Bobby S.,Fremont  CA,0,7,,11/9/2017,5.0,Great food and drinks. Must try the deep dish pizza!
Candy R.,Newark  CA,60,52,37,8/24/2017,1.0,I would give this place zero stars if I could! My family and I came on a weekday at 12:30 and sat down for 15 minutes without anyone even acknowledging us  giving us water  or taking our order. No one even blinked when we walked out the door and told them the problem. Don't come here
Turd F.,San Lorenzo  CA,11,57,15,4/7/2017,2.0,BJ's is not like it use to be! Quality of food went down! The service was ok. The host was nice  bartender fast  but the different waitresses were slow  and didn't follow up on anything! They were real quick with the check though!!The main thing I really didn't like was the food! Calamari was a very skimp appetizer! There once huge fully loaded chicken baked potato was such a sad sight  It looked like a very small house sized potato that really won't fill u up! I'm glad the waitresses didn't check on my table! It stopped me from spending anymore money here! Sorry but I will not be going back or telling anyone about this place for a loooooooong time!
K. D.,San Leandro  CA,1,72,6,9/14/2017,5.0,Food  Desert and Service..... We enjoyed everything. The beginning was a little ify with the hostess not wanting to seat us were requested but..... Rosario to the rescue. Also from her order taking  recommendations  food served piping hot  never an empty drink glass  she is definitely a keeper. If she isn't a shift lead promote her now and don't let her get away. Thanks BJ's and Rosario  We'll Be Back.....
LeAza D.,Hayward  CA,109,250,830,1/22/2017,2.0,I just come for the beer only haha! Berry burst beer! Only one I get when the ohana and I go there. Also  use to get the baked potato too. But when o ordered it last time  it was smaller compared to before. (It was worth it). Now  I just get the salad and the beer  also the pazookie .. the burgers  pizza and pasta I don't really like or enjoy there at bjs. Idk just think they're salty for some reason. Only reason a 2 stars. It's because  the waitress kept talking to her damn friends the whole time. It's the waitress with the long hair with a ponytail. (Asian girl) super annoying. Didn't give her a damn tip at all. Even the table near us. Didn't like her either. Since the whole damn time she was with her friends. That sat at a table across from us. I even yelled at her. But she didn't seem to care.
Nicole M.,Union City  CA,23,5,3,9/7/2017,3.0,"Service is good although food and menus suck. They changed the menu a while back and I was completely bummed. It\'s as if they revised everything to incorporate ""healthy"" options. Some items include barbacoa cauliflower pita tacos  yuck. What happened to regular tortilla? I now usually avoid eating here because the lack of good food options."
Swetha V.,Sunnyvale  CA,0,7,,9/6/2017,4.0,Deep dish pizza was the best on the table. Just loved it!! Boneless wings were too salty:( pasta was good but not exceptional.Pizookie tasted awesome:) being a desertarian I cannot say the desert was bad;)
Ronald F.,Daly City  CA,268,41,3,7/21/2016,2.0,Ordered Gourmet 5 Meat. YAY DEEP DISH PIZZAZ RIGHT? Well the taste was definitely there with the bacon  ham  and sausage. Unfortunately tomato/tomato sauce was not. Not sure where it went. Haven't gone to BJs for about 6-7 years but it seems like it will be a recurring factor.The so called deep dish pizza is more like cheesy bread with a bunch and meat to distract you from the missing tomatoes. The blast of flavor did its job. I finished 3 slices before realizing it.
Jules V.,Danville  CA,27,118,52,3/25/2017,5.0,Always great service and super yummy. Our go to place. The Brussels sprouts w an amber ale and vodka martini strait up and stirred was a great marriage. Next up super foods salad and shrimp tacos on the enlightened menu felt like we had super powers after from so much delicious food and healthy life saving properties. I am in love w this enlightened menu. I feel so zen like I can conquer the world after leaving here.
Jonathan Y.,Roseville  CA,0,82,25,8/26/2017,3.0,Normally I don't visit all to many chain restaurants but I have to give some praise on a particular appetizer. The Brussel sprouts with Sriracha were awesome. Other than that same old stuff
M H.,San Jose  CA,0,24,,8/31/2017,2.0,"I\'ve been here a few times. Place is always packed  with long waits  and scatterbrained and exasperated servers. Really long wait times that favor those who call-in over those who have showed up in person--and staff will tell you that to your face after you\'ve been waiting for twice as long as you\'ve been told you would. Waiter tossed food on the table  our ""made to order"" pizookie came out in five minutes  far before our entrees. We were starving after our hour wait  and had two hungry children with us  so we ate our dessert before our dinner. Food is fine. It\'s not great  and it\'s not quick--unless it\'s the pizookie. But it does the job."
Kaynesha W.,Las Vegas  NV,0,17,1,11/5/2017,5.0,Our waiter   Jason was amazing ! He is the reason why we will be back . Food was great too but customer service was off of the charts ! Thank you so much !
Bill G.,Sunnyvale  CA,42,761,51,3/9/2017,2.0,Huge menu  great beer selection  but slow service and this place gets crazy busy. Plus  the pizza isn't that great.
Ellen M.,Aptos  CA,9,99,,6/29/2017,4.0,Good food  huge menu  nice decor  great wine list. Bar is very nice with a friendly but unobtrusive bartender. Easy place to meet friends and have dinner while in Newark.
Zoe Y.,San Francisco  CA,951,213,239,12/15/2015,1.0,*REVIEW IS REGARDING TAKEOUT*Horrible. Last night  we ordered takeout and I was super disappointed. We called around 11:15 to order and pick it up. We ordered a side salad  penne with butter only  French fries  and the Santa Fe spring rolls. Anytime I've dined at BJ's they have always done penne with butter  no problem. Clearly it was an issue here. They charged us for a Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo  even though I was not getting any chicken or any sort of meat. As if that wasn't annoying enough  when we got home I opened it and there was literally 15 noodles in the whole thing. The salad also looked half full and not what it should have been.
Paul N.,Fremont  CA,0,8,,7/14/2017,1.0,The worst take out service - If they will even answer the phone!!!!!We have weekly offsite meetings for 10-14 people. All the other restaurants love our business and encourage it with good service. On numerous occasions when attempting to call in the take out order  the phone was not getting answered  and when it was I was put on hold and they hang up. I had to call the BJ corporate offices just to get a return phone call from the branch manager to take my order for 14 people. This is the last time. They are a bunch of idiots.Consider your options carefully before making a bad choice
Mighty M.,Fremont  CA,1,79,68,7/22/2016,4.0,Just finished eating here.One of the circle of restaurants we go to near our place.Was going to take out one star for slow service but my food was good. The service is alright and like an average busy food chain. On a Thursday our wait for dinner was not bad at around 10-15 minutes.Ordered calamari and avocado egg rolls for appetizer and both are very good.My kids all ordered black and bleu burger as their faves here. Sometimes they get the pizza. I got southern fried chicken which is not in the menu but very good and my fave here. Sometimes I get the spaghetti and the loaded nachos is also good here.My kids always get the pizzookie for dessert.
Monique M.,San Jose  CA,2,8,9,11/9/2016,5.0,"Went to the restaurant for a late dinner after 9pm on a weekday and it was pretty packed! My friend and I waited about ten minutes to be seated which wasn\'t too bad.Service at this location is usually meh  but we were blown away by our server  Monique (we had the same name  HA)! She was absolutely attentive and always bringing us a refill on the drinks and she did a good job checking up on my friend and I if we needed anything else! She was super friendly and it looked like she was happy to work there. GREAT SERVICE! The food was absolutely AMAZING! I always get a deep dish pepperoni extreme. SO YUMMY. My friend and I got a medium  which has 8 pieces - each of us split it so we ate 4 each!We also decided to try the mozzarella sticks which were pretty tasty as well!MAKE SURE YOU SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! BY DESSERT I MEAN THE PIZOOKIE  DUH! If you don\'t know what a Pizookie is  it\'s basically a huge oven baked warm delicious cookie with TWO HUGE scoops of ice cream to top it off! GOOD FOR SHARING! They have different flavors for each Pizookie and a thing called a ""Pizookie trio"" where you can try 3 mini pizookie flavors for about $10 dollars!I got the chocolate chunk flavor  UGH. SO MUCH GOOEY CHOCOLATEY GOODNESS! I will definitely be back again soon! Especially for the PIZOOKIES! I want to try all the flavors!"
Sharim S.,Hayward  CA,37,33,83,6/30/2016,3.0,I used to go more often when I lived in Fremont but times have changed since then. It's even more crowded and I assume it will only get worse once the condos next door get built and the mall is fully renovated. So expect a long waiting line. Came here twice in the span of 2 weeks and had fun both times but the first time had a 30 min wait and the second time an hour wait...yikes. The food is a bit pricy but heard no complaints except for my friend who said her pasta Alfredo was dry but I love their beer here and their other entrees seem like good quality. I ordered the kale salad and was very satisfied with the taste  not at all bitter  and the appetizers were yummy. My main complaint is the service is very slow but the bathrooms and tables were clean and the atmosphere can get fun since they are very good about showing all the sporting events.
Aditi M.,Chicago  IL,481,122,235,1/28/2016,4.0,My friends and I have a strange and undying love for this place. Perhaps because we've been celebrating birthdays  graduations  and literally everything else here since we were in high school :') The bar is huge and they have about 1 000 TVs. The food is enjoyable probably because it is literally packed with calories and fat...and my meal is ALWAYS followed by a chocolate chip pizookie  which likely has more calories than the previously mentioned meal. You will leave here in a coma. The pizookies are my favorite thing here. I absolutely love them. They are perfect in every regard. Normally  I would probably give a restaurant like this 3 stars  but BJ's in Newark has a special place in my heart.
Anu P.,Santa Cruz  CA,0,10,7,4/23/2017,3.0,Went to this place on a Saturday night with friends. Food was really good. But very slow serving. Appetizers came after the main course. They dint even give us any plates for the main course.Soup came last and it was cold. Overall the service is really bad.
Kevin N.,Union City  CA,7,7,9,10/20/2016,5.0,Me and some friends wanted to get a late dinner after studying all night. Came through and got seated right away. Usually when I come here its super busy but I guess since it was close to 10pm  it dies down a bit. Our waitress was very nice and would check on us frequently to see if we were doing alright. I just had a birthday last week so I was treated with a birthday pizookie.I definitely enjoy the food here. Normally when I come here  I would order their jambalaya. This time I just got their hot and spicy wings and they were great. When in the area  BJ'S is probably one of my top picks for dining. It's great for sport events. Plenty of parking spaces. And they keep the restaraunt clean.
Theresa G.,Fremont  CA,148,525,2508,12/19/2016,3.0,Big franchise restaurant and franchise feel. Lits of space and tables. The menu huge all kinda of plates but us foodies know that  that usually means they make no signature dishes or delectable choices. Too many options  too many variables. We ordered some appetizers that were at most-ok but service was nice and efficient. Place was packed on a Friday night yet food came quick-hence 3 stars. Problem the food was lacking luster and flavor all around. I bet if the food actually tasted better it would be 5 star. Bummer. Yet we ate because we were hungry but left lots of food. (my dogs ate it the next day-they loved it). The table next to us was the same! Plates full of food unfinished-what a shame! Would go back for beer and appetizers nothing else. I must say that the manager was very professional and attentive and wanted to make things right. Kudos! She comped 1 of our pizzs. It was suppose to be Chicago deep dish and OMG not even close- was like a Expensive little Cesars pizza with less sauce (insert annoyed emoji here). So yeah the food was repugnant.
Jules W.,San Jose  CA,3,95,,1/5/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"I\'m so sad to report that I will NOT be returning to this location. The last two times I came I had to return my drinks... Last night I had to do so twice! I just gave up. One of the bartenders thought they were being smart by replacing my weak ass long island for an even WEAKER one thinking I wouldn\'t notice the difference. He must have been on something good. LI drinkers know what to expect  as a bartender you should have known better! Two things about me you should know  don\'t mess with my FOOD and don\'t you dare serve me a BS Long Island. 7 liquors in that bitch and I can\'t taste ONE? Fk out of here. Really? They gave me a carbonated lemon-aid! You know it\'s probably one of the most (if not  the most) expensive drink on any menu so please miss me with that.  It definitely wasn\'t our waiters fault however he wasn\'t much better. He could have apologized for  1) me having to send back the first drink 2) me having to send back the second drink 3) when our salads came  asking us a BS question like ""Oh  do you not have utensils?"" ( Do you see any? Your salads aren\'t that great that we\'re gonna sit there and stare at it!) 4) Give or take  just being a monotoned as waiter. No smile  no real greeting  not really attentive. Maybe he was having a bad day  I get it. However  when your customer is clearly unhappy  the least you could do is apologize. Not because it\'s your fault  but because your team is messing up and therefore messing up your tip! Your money! Ain\'t nobody got time for that. But it\'s obvious to us that you could have cared less.. and that\'s fine honey. So  we up and left that bitch. ( Bj\'s  not him LOL)We ordered apps which were probably already in the making that we never got. That went to waste. The two drinks that I had to send back went to waste  tho I would have been happy with them just making it proper by adding more liq instead of making two weak ones. The salad that we got but never ate went to waste. So good job you\'ve wasted all of those items Bravo! Went to Elephant bar  had a REAL drink and a REAL waiter and ended up having a bomb ass date night regardless. I believe everything happens for a reason  even shit like this  and I was meant to have a wonderful waiter and proper drinks that night. So Thank you.P.sExtra star for the delicious water that was brought out pretty quickly. At least that didn\'t go to waste."
Jessica S.,Concord  CA,2,5,1,8/13/2017,5.0,The reason this place is getting 5 start is only because of their food. The customer service is vary. I went there last week and I was disappointed in the customer service. But I visited it again to celebrate my brother's birthday and their service is amazing. Overall their food is definitely worth a try.
Gerardo C.,San Mateo  CA,7,8,2,7/29/2017,2.0,Food and service was okay but I have to say that their reservation system sucks my family and I came in today Saturday  July 29  2017 checked in at 4:45party of 8 I was quoted approximately 30 to 35 minutes wait it turned out to be 1 hour
Veronika S.,Castro Valley  CA,44,11,1,10/14/2017,4.0,This review is primarily for Roddy  the manager. Tonight's dinner started out terrible. Checked in  quoted a wait of 25 minutes  after 25 minutes told it would be an additional 20 minutes because we were misquoted originally. Quite irritated but whatever. After an additional 20 minutes  told it would be another indefinite period of time because of the call aheads. Frustrated  we talked to a manager. We wouldn't have stayed if it would have been over an hour. The manager  Roddy  was very polite and seated us almost immediately. After waiting at the table for about 5 minutes with no server greeting us  he quickly came by and apologized  took our order and brought us drinks. After a terrible beginning to the meal  Roddy single handedly saved the night. If it wasn't for him we would have been extremely upset   but his professionalism and attentiveness made the night worth it. Thank you Roddy!
Donald H.,Oakland  CA,1,20,10,3/20/2017,4.0,Only gave it a 4 because the floor is ridiculously slippery here. Not sure why or what causes it but it's definitely a safety hazard. I always enjoy the food and atmosphere whenever I visit this location. My last trip was excellent and our waiter by the name of Benjamin was really cool. He noticed my Dragon Ball Z shirt and started to geek out which was awesome. They were extremely busy at he time and I could tell he was tired when we first sat down  but the shirt seemed to rejuvenate him lol. I'll be back soon but please fix the floor issue.
S K.,Torrance  CA,0,17,,8/4/2017,2.0,"Food so does not taste good here. Only came bc it was the only thing open at 11pm. Got the pizza ( 1/2 bj favorite and 1/2 chicken bacon) and the sampler appetizer platter. The ""deep dish"" Pizza is 90% bread! Appetizers try to copy others (i.e. Avocado egg rolls from Cheesecake Factory) and fail miserably. We couldn\'t eat the chicken wings with the *something* chipotle sause. Tasted sooo sweet and weird. I gave it a 2 star only bc the waiter was nice and friendly. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star!!!"
Isela S.,Fremont  CA,1,9,7,3/12/2017,1.0,Ordered a grand deluxe guacamole burger well done for curbside service and this is what i get.. an uncooked NOT well done burger. Disgusting. I always have good things to say about BJs but this is the icing on the cake for me. The cook just slapped the burger on and flipped till the outsides were cooked and said it's done. This is UNACCEPTABLE. DISGUSTING. NOT COOKED!!! I contacted the manager and he said he will email a gift card which I have yet to receive any email about. But a gift card is not enough for this raw burger.
Bryan M.,Newark  CA,1,4,,4/5/2017,1.0,Normally I like BJ's  their food is consistent and their service is reasonably good for a place as busy as they are...Tonight  however  I ordered take out and it took over an hour for the food the be ready. We showed up at the time the BJ's app selected  and then waited for 40 minutes for the food the be ready. When the food got home  tomatoes of the food was cold or soggy after sitting there for 30 minutes waiting for the pizza. This may be the last I eat there.
Ritchie S.,Fremont  CA,0,1,,10/13/2017,1.0,This place has the worst service. Ordered some food to go and they did not get the order right. Did not have the food ready and missed half of the food that was ordered. The worst  ridiculous place to order food. Incompetent workers and incompetent manager. Absolutely ridiculous! Avoid this place.
Laura C.,San Francisco  CA,0,29,5,10/15/2016,1.0,Although I love BJ's this particular location was horrible and very unprofessional. Slow service  cold food and through out our whole dinner water from the ceiling was dropping on us and our food. When we asked to speak to a manager the manager didn't come for about 10 min and when she did she seemed very overwhelmed and didn't want to address the problem. Instead she questioned us as if we were lying and proceeded to take the food off the table and throw the receipt on the table just charging us for our drinks. No sorry or any compassion. Very disappointed. For being such a well known corporation and obviously a million dollar business you would think they would apologize and offer some type of compensation. Will never return to this location again.
Navi G.,Newark  CA,24,29,76,2/4/2017,2.0,Today's review was ugh... not good....food was reasonable.. but we lost our appetite due to lack to of service... waiter was missing most of the time... not sure if he was new... he seemed lost most of the time. He didn't follow up with us at all... We have had better days here... waiters make a big difference.
Ter L.,San Jose  CA,182,808,8393,9/7/2015,4.0,Came here to meet and catch up with a girLfriend who happened to be in town. We met up on a Sunday night at 8:30PM and parking was absoLuteLy terribLe. I was not abLe to find an open spot even after circuLating muLtipLe times. If you don't mind a sLight waLk  there is additionaL parking next to the Firestone tire shop (strictLy for BJ's customers).There was a twenty minute wait for our party of two so it was a busy night to say the very Least.The first thing you notice is the open space  the cLeanLiness  and the amazing bar. The food was good and the customer service was even better. Our server was very attentive but wasn't overbearing. I wouLd definiteLy come back if I'm in the area- it's not convenient driving from San Jose when there are two other BJ Locations in my area. BUT Kudos to this Location for giving me the best experience I've had  Keep up the great work!
Prabhleen B.,Sacramento  CA,0,15,9,7/31/2017,1.0,This was absolutely the WORSE experience I've ever had at a BJs restaurant. We had been waiting for 40 mins to get a table. When we were finally seated; we asked if there was any way we could get a booth table and we don't mind waiting. The host showed us so much attitude and said most of these are booked for bigger parties mind you we were a party of 6. When the server came to us  we asked him as well  because we saw a booth opening up. She said that the party AFTER us were given that; and we told her we should've been giving that especially after requesting it. We just sat down at our table and began looking at our menu. We ordered appetizers  which came out but we had NO utensils or plates  also have yet to receive our drinks. After this happened to us we asked to speak to the manager. The manager came and she was unapologetic  as well as making excuses for the host. She did absolutely nothing to solve the problem and just brushed it off.  While we are talking to the manager  the host comes up and starts listening in to our conversation. Finally it took so long for the server to actually place our order. I am a regular at BJs so seeing this kind of service was very upsetting to me. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here. The service was horrible Food was so so. Overall very disappointed.
Steven O.,West Linn  OR,10,47,5,7/15/2017,1.0,Customer service is awful here  they gave away our table when we were standing right there. Then the hostess showed a group of people who came after us to a table that we were waiting for. Will never attend here again. Then when we called her on it  she started to say we could sit at the bar. Only when did we get tough did she actually make a decision and got us a table.
Ashley Y.,Milpitas  CA,2,11,3,10/2/2017,1.0,Thought I'd pop in for a quick bite while my car was in the shop at the neighboring gas station. When I first walked in the hostess' back was to the door. She had no idea I had even walked in. Waited a few seconds for her to turn around and notice people had walked in (a group of 4 had come in after me). She finally turned around and saw that people had come in. I told her I just needed a table for 1. She asked me to step to the side and she would seat me in a second. The bar area was pretty crowded (Monday Night Football) but the rest of the restaurant had plenty of open seating. Stood around for about 10 minutes while the hostesses socialized before I left.
Al-Leigh R.,Anaheim  CA,98,14,1,8/6/2016,1.0,Wait went faster than expected & everyone we encountered was nice enough but...1. Brought my bf the wrong food. We weren't going to say anything but bc of the price difference in the items  decided to bring it to the waitress's attention. She said she rang it in wrong & would fix it. Manager came by to apologize.2. Second food order comes out. French fries are missing. Again  we aren't going to say anything but then I notice a long hair in the food. We're done. At this point we have both barely eaten bc I was waiting to start eating until he got the correct order. We tell the waitress and a manager we just want the check  we're frustrated & kind of grossed out. They offer to take off his food  but not mine which doesn't seem right  but oh well I guess. No pizookie for us :(
Patricia C.,Santa Maria  CA,71,23,3,5/15/2017,5.0,Obviously this place is good it's always packed with people that's always a good sign   The food is great and service is good .
Pavan A.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,5/12/2017,1.0,Attitude  Rude  Worst ambience  Bad Service...what not..?? Definitely this not the place you want to spend your Friday night....!!! Hate it...will never visit this BJ's....!!!
Dana M.,Fremont  CA,0,2,,10/2/2017,2.0,"I love the food but this location was horrible on its to go/delivery order! I ordered 4 bacon cheeseburgers and all 4 were missing the bacon. Cheese was so cooked it looked like it was deep fried. The bacon was not an add on its a menu item ""bacon cheeseburger "". Very disappointed! I gave it two stars only because my fries were at least packaged in a bag that kept them crispy."
Rebekah N.,Hayward  CA,74,41,35,4/10/2016,5.0,"Okay honestly I didn\'t expect much from this restaurant based on the reviews but I actually really enjoyed our food and service.Food: I ordered a mini deep dish pizza with pepperoni and pesto and it was SOO GOOD. Fluffy crust and bread and lots of cheeses I really enjoyed it despite the fact that I got a mini which is literally he size of my hand. However  with an appetizer it was enough for me. My boyfriend ordered meatball marinara and he enjoyed it as well. It was a lot of food for two the appetizer and drinks really filled us upDrinks: I ordered a root beer but the kind that it "" all natural"" and made in house. It does not come with ice so I got that too and I enjoyed it. Very concentrated so I recommend ice and my boyfriend ordered the strawberry splash. I tried it and it was decent I guess I\'m not a alcoholic slushy drink type of person but if you like sweet and slushy get it! Service: our servers name was Joselyn and she was so nice. It took her long to come to us but she explained that it was due to confusions with tables. I appreciated the clearing up of things. Either than that she was very attentive and bright everything right when I asked for it. She is pretty  friendly  and I will totally come back due to her good serviceOverall: I enjoy everything from my appetizer to my drinks and my meal which is why I think this deserves such a lengthy Yelp review. :)"
Vicky T.,Santa Cruz  CA,447,2650,969,10/1/2016,3.0,During baseball season  this has been a go-to place to eat before taking Bart to Oakland. The service is reasonable and there is an additional parking lot across the street near the gas station. Nothing stands out as a spectacular  but the french dip and the kale salad are decent. Drinks are usually refilled multiple times and the wait is never long.
Kevin A.,Union City  CA,0,1,,5/8/2017,1.0,"In short: Stay away from this establishment. Corporate needs to step in. I arrived on a Sunday evening with a party of four. The restaurant itself was somewhat crowded so I was expecting to have to wait for a table - which I did  no big deal. My party and I are seated in an uncomfortably dark area isolated from most of the other restaurant patrons. As I fear and expect we are left waiting for nearly ten minutes before a waiter attends to us  again no big deal. At first he seems like a nice guy  a bit awkward but nice  I\'ll refrain from using his name as I don\'t want to publicly humiliate him for what follows. He proceeds to take our drink and food order and again we wait another solid ten minutes before he returns with our drinks. As he begins to hand out our beverages he spills a noticeable amount on the table  my arm  and my clothing. I catch him look down but he makes absolutely no effort to rectify the situation - no apology as he quickly dashes from our table to check his phone at a register station. Another ten or so minutes pass before our appetizers are brought to the table. Stuffed mushrooms with spinach and cheese. One would think - \'how hard is it to possibly mess up a stuffed mushroom\'. Well you guessed it  BJs did. They were not only cold and flavorless but about the size of a quarter. Awesome. At this point I call for a manager  something I\'ve never done at any other establishment  ever. A couple minutes pass before a middle aged women approaches the table and asks what the problem is. I begin to explain the situation to her and she looks noticeably uncomfortable as if she has no idea how to handle the situation. She offers to refund us and bring our meals out regardless but at this point I\'ve lost my appetite  I tell her I simply want to pay for what I\'ve consumed and leave. She agrees and apologizes and leaves to grab our check for us. Again we wait for what seems like another ten minutes before a waiter comes to our table with a comp\'d check and apologizes to us  ""sorry our manager is dealing with another problem right now  she\'ll be out in a few more minutes."". Unreal. We gathered our things and walked out the door. Never before have I experienced such horrible service from the top down. From the host staff  to the servers  even the management. Every aspect was abysmal. Never again will I return to this particular establishment.There is however one shining star here - April. She\'s a magnificent employee who deserves much better than this joke of a restaurant."
Satchel W.,Newark  CA,3,5,2,8/2/2017,1.0,Came in here for a late lunch today expected to have a nice meal considering it was completely dead in there. Order our food and some wings as a appetizer. First off it wasn't busy so I don't under stand why we waited 45 mins for 3 bacon cheeseburgers and not only that but the wings (appetizer) came out at the same time as the food . We asked for grilled onions on 2 of the burgers which they forgot to put on for what ever reason let our waitress know and she said she would talk to the cook about it. Waited 10 more minutes and finally got those grilled onions although it wasn't the same since we had to spread them on ourselves finally took a bite of my burger and then I noticed there was no mayo on my bread. I then got my waitresses attention and let her know there was no mayo and if they can just remake the burger. She took it back and remade it and apologized but when the burger came out this time there was no BACON on my BACON cheeseburger cmon guys get it together. I let her know there was no bacon on it now and she said she would bring some bacon out I let her know I was fine and I will just pass on the meal the manager came over and let me know he didn't charge for the burger. I will definitely not be back to this location for a bacon cheeseburger again.
Blia T.,Fremont  CA,0,2,,9/29/2017,4.0,Came here for the first time for my daughter's birthday with her friends. Appetizer platter was great; club sandwiches were great; lemon chicken...Not so much the best. Unfortunately we didn't get the typical wonderful and fast service (per daughter and friends) instead we ended up being here for 2 hours. The wait time between food  refills  bday treat and tab was so ridiculous  half our party had to leave before the bday treat. Four of us left to wait for it and the tab by the time 10pm rolled around. Everyone is annoyed and I had to let it be know of the service. The GM Evan  wonderful person  hears me out  checks out the issue  acknowledges the issue and gave gift cards. Definitely convinced me to give them another try. I didn't care about the cards but about the way he handled our issue. Kudos to Evan. Guess I will be back.
Sherrie J.,Los Gatos  CA,0,28,1,12/23/2016,1.0,Came here with some friends on a Thursday night and waited 2 hours for a table (understandable since it was so busy). The reason for the 1 star are multiple things:1) the hostess that brought us to our table just threw the menus at us 2) did not bring drinks for the whole table and when we requested drinks  she came back 15 minutes later with the rest of them 4) original waitress left and didn't say she was leaving; another waitress took our orders (this isn't a big deal  but almost  if not all the times that this is happened to me  I've had the server tell me he/she was leaving and that someone else would be helping us; maybe this isn't customary?)5) food orders were wrong 6) dessert orders took way too long (30+ minutes for a pizookie...) We kind of felt she forgot  and when I asked about the status of our order  the 2nd waitress said they were taking care of it (it was brought out about 15 minutes later so it seems like she forgot it and just placed the order for it when I reminded her)Overall  the food was meh for BJs  but I'm hoping that's just a one time thing and not a lack of flavor in their food overall. The service wasn't that great and could use some improvement.
Roseanna A.,Newark  CA,90,4,,7/12/2017,5.0,This place is amazing always good for a date night! The pazookies is what I really go for! But never really had a long wait time here. And the service is really good! No complaints here
Alejandro V.,Manteca  CA,0,2,,9/26/2017,2.0,Do not order the pizzas - overpriced for the size (medium fro approx. $20) and mediocre quality (greasy  sparse toppings  and absolutely no tomato sauce). Domino's pizzas are far superior than the one I ordered here. Also waited 45 min for a regular pizookie. Was really hoping for a better dining experience.
Mursal N.,San Ramon  CA,1,27,5,6/30/2017,4.0,This bjs is pretty good and fast with brining food. I would have gave them a 5 star but tonight they brought my crusted chicken a little cold.
Nixon L.,San Francisco  CA,34,61,10,2/20/2017,1.0,Came here with my friend Sunday and the crowed was average. We ordered calamari as appetizer   our main food and coffee all at the same time. Calamari came and coffee - so far so good. Then came our main dish but they got my friend's food wrong. The waiter apologized and said he will take off the calamari from our bill as a courtesy. We waited for another 15 mins for the correct order to come  meanwhile I did not touch my food because it's nice to eat together. When the food came I asked for more coffee. The coffee came and it was cold and probably not freshly brewed. So I complained. Then came our bill and the waiter went back on his word and charged me for the calamari. What's worse is that my friend said the women's restroom was dirty and lacked toilet papers. This place needs to step it up.
Allan P.,Fremont  CA,0,6,,7/2/2017,1.0,I've had it with the Newark Bj's. This is the fourth time I've eaten here and it's gotten worse every time. Servers don't have a clue  the restaurant is insufficiently staffed  food is poorly prepared  and delivered COLD. Cold fries don't cut it. Neither does a bacon burger with RAW bacon.It would be one thing if this was a one-off experience  but this is consistent poor performance. Save your money and go elsewhere. There's better food and service to be had elsewhere in Fremont/Newark
Jeanette L.,Fremont  CA,35,1,,9/15/2016,2.0,I don't normally leave reviews. But this is the third time I have been in here and the new bartender is just not good. My mom had to send back her margarita because it was done horribly  tasted like no margarita I have ever had. For me  he has messed up a simple bloody Mary 3 times  once it didn't even come with olives. I know that may sound harsh but this place used to have the best bloody Mary's around. So to go from the best to the worst is quite a landslide. Today I made sure to ask for all the fixings with my drink  he said they only had olives and limes. What happened to the tasty spicy glass rim and the Peruvian cherry pepper... For goodness sake  at least a stalk of freaking celery would be nice! Food has taken a bit of a nose dive in the past few months also. Too bad  this was my go to place for a quick lunch and drink.
Randee S.,Morgan Hill  CA,8,101,,10/26/2016,5.0,Really nice location. Came in here for lunch with a group of 14 of my coworkers. We ordered a lot of food and a lot of drinks. Great customer service and the food and drinks were very tasty. I think this is a newer location because the interior is very new and pretty looking. All of us enjoyed our lunch! We did make a reservation for our larger group and the table was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Our waitress was Randi and she was very accommodating and friendly. They were very attentive to our large group and everyone enjoyed their time here.
Justin T.,Hayward  CA,152,32,1,6/8/2017,1.0,Came here for dinner 2 weeks ago. It was our first visit in about a year. We were very unsatisfied with the level of service and the quality of the food.First thing  we made a reservation for a table of 13 for 6:30 the day before. When we arrived  we were told they don't have the reservation on the list. It wasn't a big deal since the wait was only approximately 10 minutes.Second  the waitress did not know the menu very well  she had to match the item on the menu with the price on the tablet to get the order in. Third  the food was very salty  it tasted like they pour the whole bottle of salt on there.Lastly  the promotional items were not discounted on the bill  we had to ask the manager to get the bill corrected. This took like 30 minutes since our waitress was nowhere to be found.We probably won't be coming back.
Anuj C.,Newark  CA,219,201,96,4/21/2016,4.0,This is a place where you are not really going for the food. i mean the food is not bad  but you kinda going here for the drinks with friends and junk food and the sports bar tvs. its a great place to watch the warriors games they even put the sound on so you can hear the commentary. The food is just alright  definitely not healthy for you. The pizzas are good and the salads are alright. their fried food snacks are pretty awesome. just fyi you will really not feel that great about yourself after you eat here  but the food is tasty and decent. Definitely would come here to watch sporting events  its a great place for it. FYI avocado rolls are awesome.
Gwyne P.,Union City  CA,535,181,220,6/10/2015,3.0,We were seated pretty fast even though it was a busy night. More than usual. I usually come here after training. I really like the atmosphere & the dim lighting.When we sat down  it took forever for our server to come. Our hostess didn't even tell us our server's name. We waited a good 10minutes for our server to come but we had to ask another server to take our order.Food was about 10minute wait. I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. It had too much vinaigrette dressing which made it a bit sour. I ordered this before and it wasn't as sour.I also ordered the calamari  but they ran out! Which was sad considering I was pretty excited for it. I also ordered the beignet with vanilla ice cream  but there was no vanilla ice cream! They offered the chocolate ice cream but we decided to cancel the order. When we did  the manager came over & told us that the vanilla ice cream just arrived & they were going to give it to us complimentary. Which was nice of them. The beignet was warm with a crispy outside & an soft inside! The ice cream was a good portion & I enjoyed the strawberry sauce. This wasn't the best experience I had whenever I come here. It was a bit disappointing. But I'll come back again & see.
Danielle B.,Fremont  CA,20,11,6,5/20/2017,1.0,Worst service ever !!!! I just left after waiting over 15 mins without being greeted by a server and the resturaunt wasn't even busy. I'm amazed that 5 servers walked by and didn't even ask if I had been helped. Wasn't even offered drinks. When I got up to leave and told take out I wanted the general manager's card because of my bad service experience they failed to offer an apology. I am beyond words....
Corinne Y.,Fremont  CA,18,9,7,5/21/2017,2.0,Sat at the bar  had bad service and it wasn't even busy. The Bloody Mary was sub-par. The bartender didn't even look us in the eye once!
H-D E.,Hayward  CA,4,40,108,11/6/2016,2.0,Would recommend the ahi salad - pear cider very nice - the pita tacos were barely ok - the concept and mixture of ingredients nice but the pita was doughy - made for an unpleasant bite- should probably have the pita warm on the side ? Well would have liked to try the fries but they came out cold - sent them back and they never got back to us-the atmosphere was for sports - so if you like to watch - big screen was nice to see the opening of the raiders and broncos game - and would probably be nice for any sports showing ! Be patient as some of the staff is still leading the art ! H - Big game in the Bay seemed to overwhelm staff  particularly the kitchen  fries don't take that long  I've been a line cook  fries are easy! The wait staff had a hard time dealing with the volume  maybe try with less people.
Jen Y.,Newark  CA,0,7,,6/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Usually service and food is great here. We come here at least once a week. We come when it's not so busy but for some reason  it still takes a while to get our food n drinks. Usually we're pretty satisfied with food n service. One  they were out of a lot of stuff we wanted to order....Tonight  we came for late Father's day dinner with our boys. Took 50 min till anyone came back to see how we were doing after we ordered...we just left  paid for our drinks. We got here at 830pm. Was still waiting for our food at 10:20pm. Wasn't even that busy. Disappointed. Only thing I'll come back for is a pazooki
Susana T.,Oakland  CA,48,15,19,5/8/2017,4.0,Food was good but I felt like it was a tad overpriced being that it's a chain. I do appreciate the wide variety of beer. The service was not terrible but nothing special worth mentioning. The kids menu was admirable for the price. I'll be back another time to see if the time of day will affect the ambience/experience.
Maria S.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,0,21,2,6/18/2017,4.0,SUPER SLOW service  so I am deducting one star. It was Father's day  and it was busy when we arrived inn the early afternoon. We were seated after about an hour. Our food seemed to take about that long again to arrive. The appetizer was never delivered. They ran out of queso and neglected to inform us until we asked.The food  when we finally were served  was great. Good portions  served attractively  tasted wonderful. The waitstaff were nice and cordial.We almost left before our desserts were served  because  again  the service was SUPER SLOW... but the ice cream scoop on a warm cookie was delicious!
Tish W.,Moreno Valley  CA,15,132,177,10/19/2016,3.0,To me this was typical BJ's. We had reservations for a party of 11. When we got there our table was ready. Our servers were professional  courteous  and fast. We all had appetizers and desserts due to a large lunch at the Habit. (except my daughter who had the Jambalaya)My husband and daughter thought the Jambalaya was pretty tasty. Our mini cookie desserts were good All in all what you could expect from BJ's.
CAScuba Y.,Palo Alto  CA,14,273,1355,10/16/2016,3.0,Popular BJ don't need no more review. I just want to remind myself their jambalaya was my favorite  much better than Fish Broiler's jimbalaya at the auto-mall. Wish their beer is pint size for the cost they charge.
sheryl a.,San Jose  CA,25,33,114,5/7/2017,2.0,We hardly like coming here cause past 2 times we have had bad experience. Since I had a GO TO coupon We decided to give it another try. We waited for about 15 min for a table for 5. We were seated but was not given the special menu or told about the specials. Went ahead and Ordered artichoke and spinach dip for an appetizer waited a while for that.Our soup and salad came out but we didn't have utensils. Had to ask for those.Main course we ordered 2 prime rib specials  comes with either a soup or salad and then 2 sides and pizookie. I asked for prime rib medium and my husband asked for his medium rare  both of ours came out well done and tough. They took his back and made him a new one. Waited at least 10 min for the new prime rib  it was better. Asked for ranch and it took 3 reminders. Also ordered a sirloin and a small pizza. Now still waiting for our server to come back to order our pizookie. We've been waiting for 20 min. We all finished our food at the table still no one has come back to check on us. Still waiting and managed to finish writing a yelp review. This will be our last visit here  not spending anymore money at this joint. Definitely need to improve their customer service and be more attentive. 1 star for their beer 1 star for their pizookie. UPDATE:it's 8:59 had to update my review since we're still here and been here since 7pm. Asked to talked to manager and she just said there's a lot of things going on and asked her why our server just never came back she said he had some issues he couldn't deal with and had to get sent home. Manager did comp a prime rib off for the inconvenience and tried her best to explain the situation and make things better.
Theresa L.,Hayward  CA,0,2,,2/26/2017,1.0,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Went to BJ\'s Brewhouse in Fremont  CA on 2/25/17 for one of my birthday dinner celebration with 12 of my friends. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I made the reservation for our large party several weeks in advance and confirmed the reservation on 2/23/17. In my opinion this was more than enough time for the restaurant to ensure that they were properly staffedWell they were not.Our reservation was for 6:15pm but we arrived early and were told that we would be seated as soon as our server arrived. We were seated at 5:45pm. We had one person taking our orders and we later found out that this was her 2nd shift. Our server apparently never showed up. As meal after meal came out  many of which were either wrong or missing items we asked for a manager at around 7:45. By this time everyone had been served and me and one other person never received our entres. The manager  Brandi  came to the table very defensive I might add and told me that our orders had never been placed. As one of my friends was trying to explain what had been going on. Brandi said ""I don\'t want to argue with you"". Lady no one was arguing We were just stating fact. Brandi walks back over to me and asks if I still want my food. Uuuhh no thank you. Everyone else is done and I\'ve been here for 2 hours already. The sad part is that Brandi was trying to blame everything on our server. Sorry it was not the servers fault that you had them working a large party of 13 people alone and on top of a double shift. Brandi as the manager should have called an all hands on deck including herself. At one point she says I will be back in a minute. I had to go to the front counter to find her after she hadn\'t come back for a while. Oh I\'m sorry that\'s probably because the other large parties were screaming and having the same issues as we were. Everyone knows with a party of more than 6  you need an additional server for the party. Brandi finally comes to the counter and says ""I\'m sorry your birthday dinner didn\'t work out. I wish we all could\'ve had a better evening"". Seriously I done at that point.She comes to the table and gives me and my friend who both never received our meals a $25 gift card. I will never use mine because I will never go to BJ\'S again and will encourage others not to waste their time. After spending too much time trying to figure out our bill and getting that correct  we fnally left the restaurant at 9pm. Really...!!! 3 hours and 15 minutes and the birthday girl didn\'t even get a meal....absolutely unacceptable."
Payal P.,Union City  CA,40,113,112,1/4/2016,2.0,"This experience is mainly for the service and not the food. Food was fine and pretty normal for BJs but the service was pretty bad. I don\'t know if it was because the server seemed new or not but it was just not good and I don\'t know if i\'ll be back at this location in the near future.Had a table reserved for 8  including 1 baby/toddler. They had reserved a booth but anyone who has a kid knows how fussy babies can get in crowded spaces so a table would have been better? Just to be able to get out in case of bathroom emergencies. Anyway  so we all sit down and the server eventually comes to us  we order our drinks. When she returned with the drinks  we gave her our appetizer choices since we were still undecided on entrees but just to start the night since we didn\'t want her to have to wait around forever and be confused. PS BJ\'s drinks are soooooo sugary. Anyway  we gave her our appetizer choices and asked to have a small pizza made to come out with the appetizers for the toddler since she was getting a little rowdy and hungry. She comes back a little while later and takes our entree orders. We had a family member who was vegetarian and asked her about more vegetarian options and she completely blanked. I understand it\'s an extensive menu but I would think it wouldn\'t be too hard to remember a few vegetarian options since there aren\'t that many but hey  maybe she just didn\'t know. Instead of asking someone  she didn\'t really give us a straight answer and we just haphazardly chose a vegetarian burger since there seemed to be nothing else  at least not that she could remember. Eventually we got all our appetizers but then.... no pizza. The toddler is becoming fussy at this point and just wants her food. We ask our waitress how long it would be for the pizza and she says ""oh no! I added it to the entree order instead of the appetizer order!"" Let\'s just say the toddler\'s parents were not happy. Mind you  there had to have been about 20 minutes between when she took our appetizer order and when she took our entree orders. So did she not put in the appetizer order right away or....? i don\'t even know but yeah  not cool. The baby\'s pizza had been cheese with olives and asparagus. When it eventually did come out  it was olives and only the end parts of asparagus. You know  the really hard parts? The ones you would usually throw away because you cannot chew it? Yeah  that\'s what was on the pizza meant for a toddler. Needless to say  she didn\'t eat them. Overall  sorely disappointed with this experience. They were nice enough to toss in a free pizookie for my parent\'s anniversary but my parents still did not enough the overall experience. I think the should take a little more care when kids are involved because unlike adults  they are not patient. Maybe if there hadn\'t been a kid involved  we would have been more patient or accepting of the situation. But not when a baby/toddler is fussing and obviously hungry. Just my two cents."
Rated Y.,Castro Valley  CA,6,27,5,3/12/2017,1.0,This place needs to be ran better I ordered a large pizza for pick up and when I got the pizza one side was smashed the pizza was cold and it was not cut into slices on top of that I had to wait 20 minutes with some girl at the front complaining how she didn't get a tip while working a 8 hr shift. I will not order here on a good day.
Kevin L.,Oakland  CA,22,28,,1/25/2017,2.0,This is not the best BJ's I've been to. Servers are slow and food isn't even warm when it comes to the table.
Sc G.,Fremont  CA,5,86,13,8/20/2016,1.0,Honestly my experience everytime I go here is poor to horrible. Waiting staff are horrible here. They tend to take way to long to take orders  bring out food late or in a weird order. One time we ordered the pizookie and the brought it out with our food and we had specifically said that we wanted to make sure we got it after we got done eating. And sadly  as good as your root beer and cream soda's are. They alway come out so flat.
Andrew M.,Fremont  CA,164,516,249,9/12/2016,5.0,This by far is my favorite chain restuaurant. They have great house beer and still have good outside beers and spirits. The food is always good and service is usually really good. Outside of a few bad times  most are great. Plus if you like dessert  you can't go wrong with the pizooki...or how ever you spell it. The big tvs all around also makes this a great place to watch the game while enjoying some good food. Will keep coming back until it becomes unbareable.
Suzy S.,Hayward  CA,282,623,124,1/25/2016,4.0,I don't often frequent chain restaurants  but made an exception when someone gifted me with a gift card  so we decided to try it out. With that being said  I really enjoyed lunch here with Mr. S.We both ordered a entree salad of very different ingredients and both were excellent. I had the Ahi salad that was packed with enough cucumbers and other goodies to satisfy my need to crunch. Mr. S had a Southwest Chicken salad which he devoured in no time. By the time I thought I'd like to sample his  it was gone!Service was fast and friendly.A large movie complex nearby is almost ready to open so I'm sure we'll be back again soon.
Tina H.,San Leandro  CA,427,137,123,7/24/2016,4.0,I don't come here often but when i do the food and service is always amazing! I usually get order the ribs or a pasta dish but i was in the mood for some steak! I ordered the sirloin steak with a side of seasonal veggies and Brussels sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were my favorite! My friends ordered the deep dish pastas which looked amazing! If you haven't had their pizookie (pizza cookie) before you haven't lived! They're absolutely amazing and well worth the calories!
Stephen S.,San Jose  CA,499,9,15,6/18/2016,2.0,I've come here a couple times with my GF. I'm usually pretty basic and either get a pizza or the spaghetti because BJ's got rid of my favorite dish  the Cajun Pasta w/ grilled chicken (UGH). It's pretty average for a BJ's. Almost every BJ's I've been to has been a very 3/5 stars for service and I've never really had a spectacular experience with BJ's in terms of service. One of our servers did inform us that pizookies were free with a purchase of at least $10 every Tuesday until July (also half off wine! like.. bottles included!) so that was a plus. The thing that kinda made me EH about this place was that I left my credit card with the bill when I left the restaurant (I have a problem doing this...). I called back to the restaurant because I know for sure I left it in the bill as it was nowhere in my car or wallet and I realized it was missing on the car ride home. I called back to the restaurant and they didn't have it... After checking my credit card online  a $50 purchase was made somewhere in Newark that was not by me. So... I'm pretty sure one of their employees took it and used it somewhere. Service/food? Pretty average.But sketchy. I had to cancel my card. Thanks BJ's.
Norma L.,Newark  CA,2,1,,2/12/2017,1.0,The service was bad ....they sat us in a table and no silverware or napkins.....food was good but slow.....server was slow and hardly came to our table......
Rita C.,Fremont  CA,0,7,,4/20/2017,3.0,Went during lunch break at 12:30 not packed. But after sitting at table for 10 minutes had to go to host and ask them for a waiter?Food was good Service below par.Especially when people are on lunch breaks should have better service. Lunch was over an hour and all I had was a salad and lettuce wraps.
Kevin S.,East Oakland  Oakland  CA,0,11,,4/5/2017,1.0,Waiter here apparently doesn't know what he's doing. Waited over 15 minutes before ordering a meal. Passed us at least 3 times. My water is low a few times and ignores it when he walks by. Then later comes and check on me for a sec but my cups of water was empty. Doesn't offer to fill it up or ask me if I need any water. Waiter isn't very social  doesn't even know where the restroom is. Food was decent but bad service. The other part is he would take care of the other tables. It's pretty bogus.
Marigold M.,Fremont  CA,15,165,98,3/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Food is average not over the top. The service is hit or miss. First time I came April was our server. And was on point. So awesome. Next time we came our server Kassandra spent more time talking to her co workers or completely ignoring us. We ended up asking a busboy to refill our drinks. Then had to waver her down just to get our bill closed out.
Terri G.,Albuquerque  NM,99,17,14,7/2/2017,3.0,I gave up on coming here for entrees because to always been subpar but the pizzookie is always amazing!! I would post a picture but I always eat it too quickly to snap one. Warm  gooey  chocolatey and basically the best thing you will eat in your entire life. Have dinner somewhere else but come here for pizzookie!
Christian V.,Oakland  CA,65,2,,7/18/2016,1.0,"Really disappointed today. Went in with a friend after craving BJ\'s for so long. We\'ve both been to this specific location more than once and have never had a bad experience. But today was terrible. We waited 5 minutes to be seated when it was not busy. Once seated we waited for 20 minutes with no service. We had already figured out what we wanted within 10 minutes. We were not offered any drinks and more than 4 different waiters and waitresses walked by clearly trying not to acknowledge us. We then decided to leave and returned our menus to the hostess. All we were given at that point was terrible service and a \'Sorry\' which sounded like a question  ""I\'m sorry?"" Did not feel like talking to the manager. We were too hungry at that point so we wanted to leave as soon as possible. Any other times/experiences this place would have gotten an easy 4 star. But after close to a year of not coming to a BJ\'s and now experiencing this  I am so upset and disappointed  and most likely never going to come to this location again."
Anais R.,Fremont  CA,29,13,2,11/16/2016,3.0,The food??.....its tasty and they have a really good variety of choices. But its dissapoiting on take outs  it has been twice when i order chicken qings with regular bbq and what i receive is wings with no sauce....mmmmm first time ok! But twice allready? Oh and csnt forget the face that the hostess haves when u come in!! Look guys i worked in restaurants for several years and still working in a restaurant and let me tell you something  treat others the way you wanna be treated. There is no cost on having a smile!! Any ways thats my review maybe ill go back bcuse i care less how the staff treats me im just in to the food
Iris M.,San Mateo  CA,115,12,1,7/14/2016,2.0,I've eaten at a few BJs before and this by far was my least favorite. My boyfriend and I stopped by here to eat dinner  before our movie at the AMC theater across the street. Upon walking in  the hostess took about 5 mins before she acknowledged us when the worker in front of her told her that there were customers that just walked in. Yet  she decided that folding napkins were more important. My bf ordered  a side salad which had only about 3 croutons in it. Where are the other croutons? Did they run out? Next came our spinach and artichoke dip  which was delicious! However  after serving the dip  we noticed that it wasn't even filled half way to the top! We probably only ate about 6 chips with it. So disappointing for being a $10 appetizer. Now for our meals  I got the roast beef dip and my bf got I believe fish tacos. He was pretty pleased with his food  but as for me  the dip was too thick for an au jus  and lacked flavor. I did not enjoy it  and didn't eat it. The best part of my meal was the thin cut fries and the honey mustard I asked on the side.Overall  I'd choose other places over BJs if I am ever back in Newark. Our server was great. Very attentive and friendly. It's the food portions that need improvement. Especially  being a big franchise such as this. Subway probably would have been more worth it.
Melissa P.,Hayward  CA,8,25,44,4/22/2017,4.0,Review on the to go service  I really was impressed by their service. I ordered a mini supreme pepperoni pizza and their hand crafted root beer soda. I called when I was only ten minutes away from the restaurant to put in my order and when I arrived my order was ready. The pizza was the perfect amount for a single serving and the root beer was okay. My only disappoint about the root beer was I've tried it before when I ate at the restaurant and it was served in a icy cold chilled cup  when I ordered it to go it came in a plastic cup and not as cold. So  probably will pass on ordering their hand crafted sodas to go. But overall the pizza was delicious.
Altoni Leen C.,San Leandro  CA,274,76,134,7/6/2016,1.0,Is it just me or the portion of the food is less over time. I've been coming here for years but somehow  its more disappointing of a visit than the previous ones. Why do I keep coming back? sometimes it's the only one open around and i'm super hungry...I went here last night with my boyfriend and we ordered the spinach dip and chips  calamari  a couple of ice teas and root beers  and a large deep dish.Spinach dip: The chips were stale. The spinach dip was burned on the edges and the portion was only filled up half way through the bowl it was in. My boyfriend even looked at me and asked the waitress why the portion is so small. The waitress said that the bowl was just big and that's amount of the dip was their standard amount... lies. I've had more before. it also looked like the dip has been sitting in that bowl for hours cold and then they popped it in salamander oven to heat it up and it got burned. We hate to send things back to the kitchen and who knows what happens in there with our food.Calamari: Last time my boyfriend and I went there  there were only 8 to 10 pieces of calamari on the appetizer plate  the size was so small  I could grab all 10 with one hand. The plate it was served on was huge as well so it made it look empty on the plate. last night  they had a smaller plate so it seems more on the plate when there wasn't.ice teas: They put too much syrup on the flavored ones. I like sweet stuff but they are very generous on the amount of syrup they pump in these drinks.Pizza: The pizza came out and it looked cold. i ate a piece and half and my boyfriend ate one slice.BJ's in this location would be my last choice
va W.,Eureka  CA,10,12,3,9/18/2016,5.0,Great food  the game was on  it was super busy but we were seated quickly. It was my friend's birthday so we got a complimentary bazookie which was very sweet. Yudasi was the BEST. Very attentive  friendly  sweet and made extra sure we had everything we needed. Request to sit in her section her and tip her well! :)
Sofia A.,Castro Valley  CA,393,156,294,6/2/2016,5.0,My friends and I came here late on a Saturday night. We were worried there would be a long wait and we were hungry but around 11 there was no wait at all. I assumed there would be a lot of people at the bar. We got seated at a nice booth and our server took our order fast. He was nice but it often seemed like he was rushing us and trying to get us out the restaurant. I understand it was late and he was tired but the place wasn't even closing until 1. Also a big problem with him was that he had extremely bad body order. My whole table could smell it and even when he walked by. We literally had to hold our breath when he came to the table. I guess he was hard at work though right? HahahAs for the food  they have an extensive menu all the way from pizzas to burgers to pastas to unique baked potatoes. Their bacon burger was probably one of the best and highest quality burgers I have ever had. It was so good I'm dreaming about it right now. I also always order their root beer because it comes from the tap with no foam. I'm not much of a beer drinker so I don't really opt for their beers but they have a large array of selections.Overall  great franchise restaurant just wish our server was wearing deodorant lol I'm always a fan of this place.
Mimi 9.,Fremont  CA,0,15,2,7/13/2016,1.0,The floor was very dirty  bathrooms wet allover and no paper toilet  although we went for diner  still all this things need immediate attention..Also I order coffe al. I notice the cup was super dirty from half way down  I asked to have a clean one and the waitress said that all cups are like that!!! supposed to be white inside out  they don't care about the cleanliness...Definitely DON'T COME BACK...
SouthStack F.,Hayward  CA,87,18,,3/23/2017,1.0,First we waited 45 minutes for a table after they said 15 minutes. Second they gave my friend a half a burger patty and had to remake it. Third a side I ordered never came. Forth two of us ordered pazookies for desert. Ten minutes later the manager comes and tells us one of our pazookies cant be made due to recalls.
Temmara S.,Oakland  CA,155,144,561,10/29/2015,5.0,We had a group of over 10 people and our waiter Ed was pretty damn amazing juggling all of us. We came here on a Friday night for my friends birthday and was told the wait would be about 1-1.5 hours and only ended up waiting about 40 mins. After sitting down we brought in a cake and asked if they could help us surprise my best friend. As a team  they pulled it off and it was pretty awesome. Since it was a tiered cake  we gave the bottom half to the employees. The food was ok  there was some complications with he food not arriving on time and not tasting up to par  but Ed  took care of all that for us! He made sure that everything was ok and if we weren't happy  he didn't charge us for it. Some people need to understand that it's not the waiter  they have no control on the kitchen and how long things take.Overall it was a good experience compared to other Bj's(Concord).
Gaganpreet S.,Santa Clara  CA,1,6,,4/2/2017,1.0,Went to the place last week and was having a good time up until I found a female hair in my burger and that too in my bite  in my mouth..Ugghhh.. I felt so disgusted afterwards and just wanted to leave..I rinsed my mouth for like 5 mins straight after that..Terrible experience
George W.,Fremont  CA,201,30,28,12/18/2015,4.0,For what it is  BJ's is a decent restaurant overall. It is not a NY pizzeria nor is it a gourmet pizza  however it is a nice brewery that happens to serve pizza.Come here more for the social atmosphere and the many beers on tap vs. coming here to get the greatest pizza ever. It's good to have the proper expectations when going into a restaurant so that there isn't a major let down.We were here this past week for an office party hosted by BJ's. Food was decent  drinks were good  the time we had was great. If you have room for dessert.... order the pizookie. That's worth it!
Mika D.,Bay Area  CA,79,191,2,12/28/2016,2.0,Me and a friend went here to eat this past weekend for dinner.I ordered a beer and my friend ordered a soda. A few minutes later he changed his mind and ordered an ice tea. The waitress tried to argue with him telling him she already placed the order  so she could not change (strike #1). We flagged down another waitress  and she with no hesitation went to get the ice tea and apologized for the other waitress rudeness. Waitress brought our food out a few minutes later  and didn't come back to check on us until it was time to go (strike #2). I ordered a chocolate Pizooki to go  she brought back a chocolate chip Pizooki instead! (WTF...strike #3)!I don't know if she was new or just extremely unprofessional  but her service made me think twice about coming back to this one. I've been here several times and used to enjoy it  but I started to notice that many of the wait staff just don't give a $hit about good service anymore.
Christina H.,San Ramon  CA,21,160,71,1/12/2016,5.0,For the North bay area  so far this BJ's Restaurant is the best. Good service  good food that is always consistent  and good atmosphere. No matter which server comes to serve my team (Work team) it has always been a pleasant one. The food I order always come out delicious.I eat at the BJ's by my work/home in Dublin and I have to say it's like eating at a different restaurant. If anyone trying BJ's for the 1st time  come to this location. :)
Alayna S.,San Jose  CA,199,89,84,11/30/2015,3.0,I've dined in about 4 times & still haven't had a satisfying experience. - This review is for this specific night. November 29th  I ordered a to-go at 11pm. This was a hard weekend  my daughters been sick / fever  sleeping / eating schedule all messed up.. We all felt like we needed a nice dinner in bed. Completely happy when receiving our meal. Felt good to know that even when the cooks & employees got that last Sunday night late late late to go order- they still did a great job with our order.- Spaghetti & meatball. Chicken club. Fetti & chicken kids meal. - The girl who helped us at the to go area was very nice too. Looking forward to dining in another time & trying that experience out again!
Susan B.,Hayward  CA,177,46,90,8/21/2016,5.0,Food is always good  had the clam chowder in a bread bowl. The best I've ever had. They toasted the bread bowl with butter and garlic. It might have been oil and garlic  doesn't really matter. It was fantastic. Yummy in my tummy.
Stuart B.,Oakland  CA,67,56,121,12/24/2016,3.0,They're food and drink menu (including Happy Hour) is too pricey. I ordered the chicken bacon panini with fries. The panini was good. The fries were not on point. They came out shriveled up. I ordered a mojito and it was not strong . The bartender was patient  fairly attentive  and mostly cheerful! The happy hour options are nothing to s
Maggie H.,Daly City  CA,0,3,,6/11/2017,1.0,This is a review only based on their takeout. We ordered a BJ's Favorite pizza and a mozzarella and tomato salad. As we each took a slice of pizza  we noted how odd it was that quite a bit of cheese  olives  sausage and onion was stuck to the bottom of the box. Some of the slices of pizza looked a bit bare on the toppings  it really looked more like a pepperoni pizza. It looked as if someone put the pizza in upside down  realized their mistake and just flipped it over. At the very least  they could've put it in a new box and I would've just assumed they skimped on the toppings! When we started on the salad  which I had asked for extra lettuce (there was even a sticker on it with my request)... Well  in case you were wondering  extra lettuce comes out to two whole pieces!  Not a fan of takeout  would never do it again at this location.
Josephine L.,Foster City  CA,305,230,471,1/10/2015,3.0,Avocado egg rolls: $6 during happy hour  but be warned- it's happy hour-sized! It says so on the happy hour menu  albeit in a very light unnoticeable gray color in a tiny font. We tried to order these but they came back and told us they ran out :( it was around 11 pm on a Thursday night. Santa Fe spring rolls: these are pretty tiny. Comes with eight halves during happy hour  not sure how many there are in a normal portion. These have chicken  black beans  red bell peppers  cilantro  corn   jalapeo and jack cheese. They were okay. I wouldn't get them again. The avocado egg rolls are way better (I've tried them during regular meal time before)  and much larger. Mini deep dish pizza: $6 during happy hour  also happy hour sized. But you can get as many toppings as you want! It's basically personal pizza size. But it's deep dish! It was good and came piping hot. I got pepperoni pineapple mushroom jalapeo. I ended up ordering another one after we finished the first one...My friend ordered a pizookie  but alas  the waiter forgot to enter the order in  so we did not end up getting one. The waiter was nice enough though  other than that blunder.
Angkor T.,Tracy  CA,99,34,129,2/18/2017,4.0,This is my favorite BJ's restaurant. I like most of their appertizers and that what we eat most. We went there too many times. Waiters are gerally nice and service is good. We tried their new spicy peanut chicken saba noodles the first time. We did not like it much. Their Ahi Pokes is the best.
Ryan J.,Union City  CA,446,344,754,12/7/2014,2.0,Now I know why I don't come here that often....service is SLOW!3 of my friends and I came here on a Wed night. We sat down and weren't helped for about 10 minutes. Once we looked at the menu and figured out what we wanted we waived down our waitress who zoomed by and told us that she would be with us shortly. So another 10 minutes go by and she finally takes our order  pitcher of beer and burgers all around. It took about another 15 minutes for the beer to come and then another 10 minutes after that for the food to arrive despite the place being relatively empty. Plus since we all ordered burgers  it should be pretty easy to make instead of making 4 different dishes. We requested that the burgers be cooked medium  yet we all got burgers that were for sure well done. No pink in the middle and it was not juicy at all. We could have asked for this to be cooked a little more  but we were worried that it would take forever for us to get our food back so we ended up just eating the brick of meat.This place gets 1 star for amazing pizookies & pizzas. They get another star for their beers! I love the different cookie selections for their pizookies and I love the beers that are brewed here since they are so rich in flavor!Unfortunately  I will probably not go back here unless I want dessert or a beer. I honestly don't think I should wait this long on a slow day. If this place was packed  I understand  but this is unacceptable. Sorry guys  but I'd rather go to other sports bars/restaurants for quicker service  better food  and cheaper prices.
Anna K.,Cambridge  MA,140,135,328,12/18/2015,4.0,Good for a chain  the appetizers are surprisingly yummy. Great selection of beers  obviously. The service is great  fast and welcoming.
Robert S.,Redwood City  CA,0,16,,7/4/2017,2.0,We tried BJ's for the first time. They atmosphere and menu looked really good  but unfortunately the food was disappointing. The over-stuffed sandwich on the menu turned out to be mostly bun and very little meat. Very  very little meat! The fish had much larger portions  but was very greasy tasting. All-in-all we were disappointed with the meal.
K P.,Fremont  CA,0,13,11,8/21/2015,3.0,Food is very good  service is good  i think most of the things are good and i just want to say about the light  it's sooooo dark you can't read the menu if you don't have the iPhone flashlight with you.Yes that's the only thing I want to let BJ restaurant owner know  may be he/she should go to BJ and try out to read the menu at dinner time.Thanks Kim
Evelyn M.,Castro Valley  CA,192,111,1570,6/30/2016,4.0,Last time I came for the free pazookie day I was forgot about so they comped my meal that time n gave me a $15 gift card. Today I am back for another free pazookie day n to use my gift card. Server was nice n food was good the only reason I took out a star was coz the server didn't time right on when to check on us. She checked on us when we just got the food n didn't offer to refill our drink. We had to ask n she got it to us after the other items we asked for when need a lil bit during our meal. but all was good got our free desert n I am much happier than I was prior to the last time I came.
Puneet G.,Fremont  CA,1,2,,7/7/2017,4.0,Reliable and consistent in food quality and service  I can't ask for more from a chain restaurant. Oh yea it great that the game is always on...
Shaunice P.,San Bruno  CA,0,16,5,7/19/2017,1.0,The service is terrible. Server stopped by twice. Once to take my order  2nd to bring my check. My food was gross  and my pizookie cold  my ice cream didn't even melt.
Naomi C.,Palo Alto  CA,0,1,,2/28/2017,1.0,"I went to BJ\'s on 2/25/17 for a birthday dinner/celebration with a group of around 11/12. This was  by far  the worst dining experience I have had EVER! I mean  I\'ve had better service  experience and food from McDonald\'s. I encountered the rudest ""manager"" (using this term extremely loose here) I\'ve ever come across in all my dining experiences. Awful!For the large party we had only ONE waitress waiting on us. This is very unusual for a large party especially since our waitress had two other tables and the other table\'s party was almost as large as mine. While our waitress was very attentive to what we needed and made sure to ask us if we were okay every chance she could  the food she brought out was either wrong  incomplete  cold once it got to us or missing something. After watching this young lady hustle and juggle my table and the other two she had AND watching about three other employees just stand against a wall and watch her  I encouraged a ""manager"" to come over.The ""manager""  Brandi  came over with an attitude and very defensive (unwarranted). I tried to explain to Brandi what was going on and asked if she knew that our waitress was the ONLY one serving us as well as the other two very full parties and  with the great attitude (facetiously stated) she had replied ""I do. So what\'s the problem?"". The problem is that  BJ\'s managing style displayed through Brandi  totally caused this young lady to just about fail. This ""managing"" style set her up to fail while other employees set back and watched and nobody tried to help her or display any amount of team work. Brandi  the untrained manager  then stated ""I don\'t want to argue with you"". Absolutely uncalled for!Argue? Not a single person at my table raised a voice  displayed any amount of defensive  aggression or actions one should be alarmed by  so this  was extremely insulting. Extremely! Brandi proceeds to ask me ""how can I help you""  I stated  verbatim  ""get her some help"". Her reply was ""I don\'t do any serving and I\'m the only manager here"". I again stated "" Get her some help. I didn\'t ask you to serve"".What kind of managing style is BJ\'s adopting here? A manager can\'t roll their sleeves up and be a teammate? She is absolutely disgusting in this role and should not be one to represent BJ\'s...at all.This ""manager"" tried to blame our server when it was NOT the server\'s fault. BJ\'s manager  Brandi  totally failed her. This managing style totally failed her. The kitchen totally failed her. BJ\'S FAILED HER! I am disgustingly offended at the fact that I\'ve freely given my hard earned money to a company that\'s totally okay failing it\'s servers. A company that has such a manager in position who can\'t see past a title and play the actual role.From ONE MANAGER TO ANOTHER: Brandi  you should have played the roll of the manager  pulled up your sleeves  assisted where needed  called a meeting with ALL staff and adjusted so the immediate needs of your customers AND staff were met. You failed both your staff and our party.Lastly  I am  even more disgusted that  the would be celebrated young lady didn\'t even get her meal and all this ""manager""  Brandi could say was ""I wish this experience could have been better for the both of us"". AWFUL! UNACCEPTABLE!Tell me again how this night wasn\'t well for YOU when WE patronized the store YOU ""manage""? And received nothing? I\'ll wait.If anyone wants great service  drive down a little bit on Mowry where there is a Chic-Fil_A. Managers are AWESOME and customer service is extraordinary. In fact  it was the MANAGER at this place that brought me my milk shake.Save yourself a bad time out  AVOID BJ\'s!"
Cindy E.,Milpitas  CA,145,4,2,11/12/2015,4.0,"BJ\'s has been one of my favorite restaurants for years but since the baby was born  this was our first chance to come as there are not many locations near us. Our party consisted of me  my husband and my 2yr old. Although the food was good  it didn\'t amaze me like it used to. The Buffalo Wings have sauce on them. If I remember correctly  they used to be dry with the dipping sauces (buffalo & ranch) on the side. We liked it better that way. They just taste like any other Buffalo Wings now. What really disappointed me was my child\'s food. Luckily he liked it though. Why? Because his Mac & Cheese was out of the box! He has that once in a while at home but I make it better! I cook it longer & add cheese for flavor. BJ\'s kid meal Mac & Cheese was chewy  clumpy & lacking flavor. I added a pic to the photos section. The BJ\'s non caffeinated  no fructose syrup root beer was delicious & a big hit with the kid. The chilled fresh fruit was yummy & sweet. The Kid Meal was reasonably priced at $5.75. The Hubby said his burger was ""good"". The bun was soft & not too ""doughy"". The double patties were grilled to his satisfaction. My Zitti tasted a lot better than it looked. It was delicious. Didn\'t look like the picture where you can see the pasta poking out of the sauce. When I received it  I saw a little pan halfway filled with crusted cheese. Didn\'t see the pasta until I scooped it up with my fork. Extremely flavorful. Although it didn\'t look like a lot  I couldn\'t finish it bc the oil started getting to me. The oil naturally accumulates at the bottom of the dish and after a while I felt like I was drinking it. Our server was friendly although she forgot a few important things. She handed us our food without our silverware & napkins. The wait time for the food was great although the wait time to eat the food (bc we didn\'t have any silverware) was not as great. We still tipped our waitress generously for her smiles  apologies & effort. Although we received our meals very quickly  it took our Pizookie dessert almost 4x times that wait. It was nice that our waitress came by twice to apologize & explained that they were backed up in the kitchen. We had trouble staying awake as we were so full and just longed to be home since we had quite a drive. Just as we were about to cancel our dessert  we received it. I normally love Salted Caramel everything but the Pizookie flavor was just too much for me. It was too salty & too sweet at the same time. I\'ll remember to not order that next time. I did love my husband\'s Peanut Butter Pizookie though! Overall  we enjoyed our meal. Husband\'s meal was free as he was a veteran invited for Veteran\'s Day. I am extremely appreciative of BJ\'s support of our veterans. I heard about BJ\'s special meal through Facebook (many friends were having a meal here too) & since it\'s our favorite restaurant  I decided to surprise the Hubby with this treat. Being a Stay At Home Mother & having a hard working  dedicated husband  we all deserved this special treat on this special day. Big thanks to BJ\'s!"
Joshua L.,Union City  CA,17,4,,5/3/2016,2.0,Unfortunately the standards at this BJ's have gone down. I won't be coming back for anything other than the bar. - Lost food and drinks- Some meals took over an hour -- half the table was finished eating before other meals came out- Incorrect orders- Very small portion sizes when compared to bj's 6-8 months ago.
Ariel H.,Manteca  CA,136,12,2,7/20/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Last time I came I had a bad experience with our waiter. I put it aside as my aunt wanted to take me out for my birthday dinner. It was a Sunday night and the hosts said it was about a 10 minute wait for the two of us  it ended up being more like 20 but being someone who has hosted before and now serves  I know what it's like so it doesn't bother me.Once sat we waited maybe 5 minutes before being approached by our server  Amber. She immediately gave off a super sweet and chill vibe. She gave us great service and had small chit chat with me over server life. Great service  great food. Definitely an improvement from the last time I was here.Thank you Amber!!!!
P P.,Fremont  CA,83,26,1148,3/10/2016,3.0,The reason I came here again Bcuz my bf wanted to try small pizza with chicken and all meat
Pooja M.,Manhattan  NY,451,225,895,7/24/2015,4.0,"The food at BJ\'s is just ok -- not spectacular but not bad either. The real star for me and the ONLY reason I keep coming back to BJ\'s is for their decadent  divine  and delicious Pizookie. A Pizookie  or ""pizza cookie "" is a giant freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream  enough to share between 2-4 people. BJ\'s has several flavors of Pizookie  and my favorite used to be the Red Velvet Pizookie. However it has since been discontinued and for that I am truly disheartened  but I have found a new flavor to replace it. The Salted Caramel Pizookie is so absolutely yummy  and the sweetness from the caramel is balanced nicely by the salt. I highly highly recommend the Salted Caramel Pizookie from BJ\'s!"
Allie B.,Belsera  Bakersfield  CA,110,6,1,7/10/2017,1.0,My husband and I were on a date night. Our service was beyond terrible.  We were in the restaurant for nearly 3 hours.  It took 25 minutes to even get some water and tea. Then we waited another 30 minutes to get our appetizer.  Took 30-40 to even order our food. I understand food takes awhile to make but this place wasn't entirely packed and it was staffed very well. Our food eventually comes out after way too long of waiting for meals  my meal was cold.  The shrimp and pasta noodles weren't even remotely warm.  Our drinks took forever to get refilled. I asked our server to take my plate back  and it was finally made how it should have come out.  Our server wasn't very attentive at all  my husband had been waiting for a refill for about 40 mins and had to start drinking mine. Do not recommend. I was utterly disappointed with the lack of service  and care for their customers.  Was more than annoyed and practically ruined our date night.
Michelle M.,San Jose  CA,511,551,2833,5/9/2015,3.0,GET THERE: Parking lot is big. Inside is big. Bar area and lots of seating throughout the restaurant. Warehouse type feel. FOOD: Food is eh. All their food reminds me of bar appetizer type food even their entrees like it was all frozen and they heat it up. Nothing special about their food. STAFF: Our server who took care of our party of nearly 20 people did a great job he was attentive and my pizza came out really fast. He was quick to get what the kids asked for such as refilling their drinks.
Omar L.,Pittsburg  CA,4,64,97,6/17/2016,4.0,Came during lunch time and ordered the bison burger along with the Buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich and they where both very tasty and waitress was really nice.
Cristina R.,Fremont  CA,0,9,4,2/7/2017,2.0,"When first arriving to the restaurant I was so disappointed I wanted to just walk out. The hosts in this location are absolutely rude and inattentive. You have 3 hosts at the reception desk and yet none show a warmth and friendly welcome  as you would receive from any other family restaurant. I stood in front of the reception desk literally for 2 minutes before the hosts acknowledge my arrival. I was told to follow the hosts  just to find the my table is still dirty and the table had not been properly cleaned. We stood in front of our table with the host waiting for our table to be cleaned. The hosts never apologized and said ""we have been really busy"". I literally looked around and saw less then ten tables with people. I was offended to be lied to literally in my face. Her incompetence to assist is far below the standards of BJ\'s and I am honestly surprise that management settles for less. The waiter who assisted us was very genuine and caring. Her upbeat attitude makes me feel like this place as a chance of survival. She shared her recommendations and was patient. The food came out at a decent time and everything was hot and steamy. The crispy flat bread nachos and the boneless chicken wings were my two favorite appetizers. The flat bread was crispy and the toppings are evenly spread. Every bite was an orgasm in my mouth. If you go t BJ\'s you are obligated to get a chocolate chunk Pizookie for your dessert. Cookie perfectly chunky and warm. When leaving- the hosts just gathered at the Reception Desk ALL on their cell phones with their heads down. None of them welcomed us to come back.I think the management needs to really investigate in training their hosts with proper standards for customer service."
Nathan B.,Keauhou  HI,0,2,,10/15/2016,1.0,Never met such an unprofessional manager. Was there Saturday night with friends  had some issues with an order asked for the manager to stop by  think her name was Brandi. Had to ask 3 separate times over 30 min. End state was her saying well what do you want me to do and rolling her eyes. It was not even a big a cold meal and didn't have time to wait because we were catching a movie. Granted the place was busy but that does not excuse her attitude. Our server was however very nice and communicated well with us.
Veronica V.,Fremont  CA,0,3,3,1/28/2017,1.0,Dinner was great but the server wasn't. We went on the website and saw that there was a free poozokie with any $10 purchase so we asked for it. The server (Jessica) acted confused and was looking at it like it was a made up coupon. It was pretty embarrassing to have her question a coupon that was clearly on the website. She then gave said okay and we got our dessert. We got the check and the coupon was not applied and she acted like she wasn't aware of it then proceeded to say that maybe you need a bjs reward for it. Nowhere on the coupon did it say that you needed a rewards from there. She should have honored it because it was a coupon from the website. I hope next time they know their website and don't embarrass people. Not coming back to this restaurant again.
Leanna T.,San Jose  CA,431,15,5,12/28/2016,2.0,My server was so inattentive. I forgot her name but it took her way too long to take our orders. Once she did  it took a while to bring out our alcoholic beverages and then she didn't even bring us our waters until maybe fifteen minutes after that... We ordered everything at the same time so we should've gotten our waters first. The food took forever to come out and one of our entrees came out before one of our appetizers did. After eating all our food  I asked to see a dessert menu and she didn't even check back in to see if we wanted any. I had to order it from someone else after failing to flag her down several times. I've been a server before so I know it's rough sometimes  but it wasn't even that crowded at the time. I love BJs but I probably won't be coming back to this one.
Tom B.,Westfield  IN,28,213,714,6/6/2015,2.0,"Yeah - I wasn\'t terribly impressed. My pizza was OK  but nothing to write home about. The truth is  this place didn\'t stand a chance in the pizza department  after the places I visited last week in San Francisco. Overall service was decent  but my one complaint would be the noise level. Not to sound like an 80-year-old  but does the music have to be that loud? Couldn\'t even carry on a cell phone conversation when my wife called - had to step outside  even at full volume on the phone and my other ear plugged. I felt like I was at a concert  not a restaurant. Special note to the Marketing firms that advise chain restaurants about how ""lively"" music creates a more inviting restaurant: The reality is that it doesn\'t. It just makes the place loud. Just my opinion..."
Thomas C.,San Jose  CA,0,5,,7/1/2017,1.0,Went here go to after the movies there was plenty of available sitting they still made us wait with our kids for almost an hour as they had no clue or care how to seat people and stood there talking the whole time to each other. management really needs to look into this.
Tram N.,San Francisco  CA,792,209,293,6/15/2014,3.0,(+) Avocado Rolls. I may or may not have been dragged here just because my friend was dying to have me try this appetizer and I have to say it did not disappoint. The portion was HUGE. I was actually pretty full after this dish. They were definitely generous with the avocadoes and the sauce complemented the rolls perfectly. (+) Mahi Mahi/ Shrimp Tacos WITH SOME AMAZING CHIPS AND GUAC. If you're looking to go with something light for dinner then I would definitely recommend this. You can mix and match or get both of the same ones. The portion might be considered small if you tend to eat a lot because there's only 2 tacos but it was pretty filling for me! Super fresh seafood! I was pretty full after this. OH and the chips / salsa & guac was perfect. Customers service was pretty good. The waitress was super patient with us even though we literally took 15 minutes to decide on what to get. We came for a pazookie but did not get a pazookie....
Ria S.,Hayward  CA,0,7,1,12/21/2016,4.0,I love the clean environment. And the food was delicious plus their hand craft drink was good.
Benny H.,San Jose  CA,2005,1437,7836,6/2/2014,4.0,Sometimes I can understand the low scores a restaurant and sometimes I cannot. This is the case of the former. First  the burger melt is die for. It's no longer on the menu  but they still made it for us! So they have already graced my heart with approval. It's a good meal  despite being very very and I mean very unhealthy. Mighty tasty though. Lots of beers. So if you like beer then check it out. Not a perfect restaurant by any means  but much better than the 3 stars indicate. Give this place a try and don't the reviews sway you as they are a bit off.
Michelle B.,Oakland  CA,761,358,446,4/10/2015,2.0,"The wait time is punishment enough. I just don\'t understand the everlasting wait time for food especially when traveling with hungry and cranky tweens. It will drive just any parent ape-shit crazy. Why is it that the hungriest gets their order last or wrong? Do they have a radar for ""lets pick out the crankiest and push them to their limit?"" Oddly enough the tweens enjoy it here - is it the feeling of being in a cavernous brewery  situated with grown folk? could it be the food? Perhaps it is the pizookie?! I used to enjoy BJ\'s spaghetti with meat sauce. They got cheap and caught on  instead it\'s just marinara and you are forced to add-on meatballs. WTF BJ\'s  you suck meat balls! I don\'t fucking know. If it were up to me I\'d go elsewhere.Note* use of itensifier such as the eff word  suck  ape-shit crazy and WTF are deliberate!"
JaeDean P.,Buena Park  CA,0,4,1,1/15/2017,4.0,The hostess had interesting hair. It kept me entertained while we waited. The wait time wasn't usually long. We ordered some drinks (Alabama Sunrise!) which were great. I had two. The woman that brought us the drinks placed the obviously alcoholic drink right in front of my obviously young (11 year old) nephew. That made me uncomfortable. Side note: If you're sensitive to spice  do NOT order the fried chicken. They pour peppered gravy all over it. I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Salmon. It was amazing! I wish they offered it with rice or something with more carbs.
Al S.,Union City  CA,240,139,272,4/5/2016,5.0,5-star service for Nate. He was very friendly and positive throughout our visit. And as busy as the restaurant was  he made time to check regularly.Side note  BJ's Classic Supreme Pizza was good and plenty. :)
Samir S.,Fremont  CA,171,8,,12/26/2016,1.0,"I ordered the house steak with their ""special"" dry rub. Waited around 30 mins for it to come. Once it arrived it was THE most dry POORLY cooked piece of you know what. Not only did I send my food back but two other tables next to us did the SAME. If you want quality food DO NOT come here. Our waiter was not at fault  this was 100% on the kitchen."
Edna G.,East Bay  CA,565,731,8397,3/21/2014,2.0,Finally rating after 7 visits....if it wasn't for the food  I would not go here. Expect to wait for your food or service. My experience has not been so good from expecting 6 co-workers asking for a jalapeo burger and they ran out of jalapeos during lunch! Forgetting my drink  order or side many times! Took 45 min for 4 people's food! Taking forever to get you the bill!! Love their trio Pizookie and root beer drinks as that is the best part! Easy to customize your food  if you get it!?If you are taking your time  go here as their service is super slow; it took two hours for our lunch today....good thing our work is not as mindful of our time but then again  I was with a manager....
Janessa M.,San Francisco  CA,192,145,256,8/14/2015,4.0,Our waitress Jennifer S. Was lovely and put up with our table lol the drinks are decent  food is good. Good environment! Like the lighting!
Aaron S.,Newark  CA,22,1,,1/1/2017,1.0,Brought a date here and instead of bringing a small pizza like we ordered  our waiter brought out a large. After letting him know we ordered a small he wanted to take it back and bring out a small. So it was either accept the large and pay for it or wait another thirty minutes for the small to come out. We just took the large and paid for it. Terrible service. Never coming back here.
Omar R.,San Lorenzo  CA,63,344,1382,7/12/2015,3.0,To begin with our wait time was about the standard for a Saturday night so my friends and I decided to go for broke and play roulette with the bar and hope to land a spot. Luckily we made it to a small table that seated us just right. Plan was just to kick back a few and celebrate with friends.     Our waitress greeted our group immediately and took our orders  to start with we ordered some chicken wings along with a pitcher of beer. Upon arrival of our wings we noticed that they seemed a little undercooked so we asked our waitress if we could send them back to which she obliged and was apologetic. Not too bad  she was very cordial but that was the first strike. Second hiccup on their end was the fact when we ordered calamari it seemed to come out a little under proportioned  I didn't want cause a stir but a friend tried to question the waiter who brought them out but to no avail what was done was done. The waiter who brought them out didn't give any expression  but looked more puzzled then anything. Luckily we had great conversation and tried a couple of their brews  nothing to wild and our waitress was patient and helped with most of our needs. Great time out and caught some of the ball games.
Jackie G.,San Jose  CA,12,35,3,2/18/2017,1.0,I went here a few weeks ago  I have not had the time to review but I'm here now to share my experience. 1St off we had a seat and everything was working out it was after a staff meeting next door and a group of us decided to come eat here. The waitress said we can have separate checks which was great because there was allot of us and we all ordered different price items. The waitress took our order and it took 55 minutes to get our food. We were looking around because we wanted to check on the status but no-one would stop by. We saw that allot of the tables around us were having the same problem. The waiters where by the cashiers chatting away. Finally we started getting our order  and one of our appetizers was not out yet. It came as the last dish and when we asked to take out the second appetizer because it had been like 1:25 minutes since the waiter said the kitchen already made it. We asked to speak to a manager and she tried to argue that the avocado rolls were already made. My couleage insisted on talking to the manager. The manager got there and we asked to get the avocado rolls taken off the bill and told him about our experience. He was arguing that the avocado rolls were requested as regular dishes and not appetizers. Then three coworkers got the lunch specials and they were charge dinner price. When the coworkers asked the manager about it he called over the waitress and the waitress said they never specified they wanted the lunch special price. WTF!!!! The waitress was this young asian girl and i think she had colored eyes. The manager was a young caucasian guy. Both who were useless and ridiculous. The service was horrible and we all ended up getting in trouble for what need up being a almost 3 hour lunch. They need a do some quality control there.
Shema P.,New York  NY,45,83,47,4/26/2016,4.0,I love BJs! I've been here quite a few times before I started helping and now that I moved back from NY can go more. I love their Mediterranean pizza! The crust is just perfect. The pizookie is bomb. I don't care for the jambalaya and the chicken Alfredo is ok. I guess Alfredo is supposed to be very bland and if you're going for savory not the best. The root beer ribs is honestly one of the best things. Literally falls off the bone. Prices are good because they give you a lot of food. As far as drinks go  I mean if you're going for alcohol at brewery get beer. I'm not a beer person so I thought I'd get the white peach margarita  didn't really taste any alcohol or peachiness and it was about 97% ice. I'd come back of course but not for the drinks.
Laurel M.,Fremont  CA,43,194,265,3/27/2015,4.0,Stopped by for a beer at happy hour around 5pm on a Thursday. The bar was pretty full  but we were able to find a table and were waited in immediately. The happy hour prices are great for beer and light appetizers. Since we just came for a drink  we didn't order food this time around  but a few of my favorites are the tomato and mozzarella salad with balsamic glaze dressing and the avocado egg rolls. The nutty brunette ale is also one of my favorite darker beers and the only one I order at Bj's. Can't go wrong at this place for happy hour!
Melea-An A.,Salinas  CA,438,27,4,4/8/2016,1.0,I did not enjoy my time here at all. Mainly because of the long wait we had to go through. We got seated at around 10:30 pm. It was a little busy  but it wasn't super packed. It took maybe 30 minutes for a server to get us some drinks. His section didn't even look super busy! After we got our drinks  it took probably another 30 minutes  or more  for our server to take our orders. Before our order got taken  we were trying to get the attention from a different server so he could help us out  but he completely ignored us and only tended to his section. I found that completely rude. I am also a server at a different restaurant  and I always give my attention to any customer who calls out for me even if they aren't in my section.After we finished eating  our server  AGAIN  took forever for him to give us our check and a to-go box for our food. The manager had to come over and ask us what we needed so she could tell our server. When our server came over to drop off he check and box  he didn't even apologize for the long wait. In fact  he didn't say anything to us at all. He just dropped it off and that's it. The food was good. I just wish our service was better.
Stephani M.,Airport Mail Center  CA,602,397,1728,1/21/2015,4.0,"#22Thank you Nate (my incredible service professionnal) for an awesome lunch at BJ\'s.I went to Newark to meet a few friends for lunch  and they suggested BJ\'s  so I met them WAY OUT there. The parking situation was incredibly awful. I have to park near the door in the handicap parking area at the moment  but there was no easy way to make that happen due to the construction and the poor signage in the lot. They have the regular parking area fenced off from what looked to be the employee area. Okay...I will hobble  whatever. After fighting my way through the cumbersome parking area  I entered the restaurant and the hostess greeted me in a friendly manner. I told her I would be meeting friends  but right then I saw them standing up  waving and yelling at me...embarrassing ;( lolI meandered over to the table with Jociel to meet all of our friends awaiting our arrival so they could order. Nate greeted us at the table and he remembered me from about 5 years ago at a restaurant nearby...WOW! (I wish I had that memory  my studies would move along so much faster!) He even called me ""Tall Skinny Vanilla Latte"" remembering that I was drinking one when we met and it was easy to describe the drink because i am tall  skinny and vanilla...but anyway...We ordered a few items to begin with:Corn FrittersAhi Poke TunaArtichoke PizzetteThe corn fritter were crazy good! They were hot  fresh and delicious. Served over an aioli sauce that was to die for with real corn nibblets to garnish the dish. The Ahi was amazing as well. A pretty large portion for a small bite share plate  but who is complaining? The little pizza arrived and it was spectacular! It was hard to save any to take home...Nate took such great care of our every need  even the two people who arrived late. I would give 5 stars  but that parking was a fiasco! If I were the manager I would not only complain but would also seek to resolve the parking issues during the construction. It really is inconvenient to the guests  especially for guests with mobility issues.Nate gets 5 stars  but BJ\'s as a whole--4... Stephani Smiles for BJ\'s ;)"
Lvang L.,Hayward  CA,6,39,23,3/9/2016,4.0,I usually don't do chain restaurants  but BJ's is an exception to the rule. This place is always packed on the weekends  but I don't mind the wait because the service and food are mostly always consistent. I usually go there for the beer. Tatonka  please!There were a couple of times when my food was not at par such as this one time when my fries were cold and my burger was dry as hell. Another time was when I found a strand of hair in my salad  but the manager brought me a new one and didn't charge me for it and even offered to buy my husband and me a drink  so that made up for the hair (eww). The pizzas are the most popular items here here and my favorite is the Mediterranean. I also like to order their tacos and salads. I always have a great time when I come here and the servers are usually good about checking up on us. Since I visit BJ's a lot  there was one time when I had slow service  but that's one time out of many. Pizza and beer  the American staples.
Adila A.,Newark  CA,0,1,,12/4/2016,1.0,Horibble service. Messes up order and wrong cake. Slow service  would not clean up. Don't recommend going here. Forgets orders and check.:(
Mary Lynn P.,Verona  PA,71,16,7,4/11/2016,5.0,TripAdvisor led us to the BJ's - and we are happy!! We stopped in... not hungry for a full meal but had 2 delicious appetizers!!! The boneless wings and avocado spring rolls were delicious - served piping hot! The drinks were ample and the service outstanding - Kishan did an excellent job!!!We will be sure to return the next time we are in the area!!
Yaneli G.,Hayward  CA,5,3,,4/22/2016,4.0,Amazing place for beer and does avocado rolls. Let's not forget the pizookie!! April was such a great server checking on us frequently.
Roberta M.,Hayward  CA,0,11,3,4/22/2017,4.0,Our group consisted of six grandmas. Our server was a nice young man named Trevion. He made our lunch very enjoyable. He was quick  polite  and very personable! All of us enjoyed the food as well.
Kristine F.,Hayward  CA,434,561,3600,5/11/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I highly recommend the honey mustard crisp salad (grilled chicken on mine). Mmm chopped greens tossed with honey mustard dressing  chopped hard boiled eggs  corn  cucumbers and topped with tomatoes  almond slivers  and normally crisp fried chicken strips. For appetizers we usually get the spinach stuffed mushrooms and fried artichokes for ~$5 each! The mushrooms sit atop cilantro aioli drizzle and the artichokes are kinda sour (arrives with ranch).My second favorite dish is the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The cream sauce is satisfying and not too heavy while the chicken is lightly pan fried. I prefer the crispy thin fries over the mini potato wedge style; both options are available.As for the pizookies  oh gosh are they indulgent. I got tired of basic chocolate chip with vanilla bean ice cream so I've tried the red velvet and new salted caramel ones. All of them are sweet and take some time to bake so snag your server halfway through the meal to order. Btw  Rosario waited on us during Mother's day and was a great waitress. She was on top of her game and didn't rush when taking our drink orders; she even had time to take all of our orders at the same time (drinks  apps  entrees)  which was convenient for our group. She remembered to put in our to go order at a decent time as well. *remember to do call ahead seating!
Mihir M.,Fremont  CA,295,795,437,9/22/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,BJ's is a chain with a variety of food. They are known for their alcohol. They make 4 sodas which are great  with refills  so you ask for shots of each of them & get charged for only 1 drink - black cherry  cream  orange cream & root beer (this is a non alcoholic drink in case you do't know). The virgin margherita was too thick for a drink. During happy hour  many items are discounted  including their personal pizzas  which I don't like much as they don't have a lot of sauce. They have several vegetarian pizzas & flatbreads  which are ok. The atmosphere is young  cool  & sporty. They have cookie (not eggless though) & ice cream (not eggless) deserts which are also nice.
Tessa S.,Fremont  CA,52,38,18,9/18/2016,3.0,I loooove BJ's! I love the food  the drinks  the servers and the atmosphere. There's only one downside - service is sooooo slow. I don't think it's the servers fault though. I think it's management's fault. I'm not sure how many tables one server is allowed to have  but it seems to be way too many in order to make sure all the guests needs are attended to in a timely manner. Either way I'll still keep coming. The happy hour here is too good to pass up. Just wish they could figure out how to speed up the service a little bit.
Beverly H.,Fremont  CA,0,8,,5/5/2017,2.0,Came here with my husband on a Thursday night. No wait to be seated. Looked through the massive menu and decided on an appetizer and our entree long before a server even came to our table to get our drink orders. The couple that was seated next to us got up and walked out because no server helped them after waiting a good 15 minutes. Anyway  my husband and I went to BJ's last week & the service was good and the pizza was good. Not so this time. Service was horrible and my pizza was greasy. We saw the manager once and thats when our neighbors walked out. I normally see a restaurant manager walking around making small talk with the customers. Oh  and don't sit a party of 2 next to 3 huge parties of 8.
Alex M.,San Lorenzo  CA,12,35,7,3/25/2016,3.0,This place is never really hot and it's never too cold  sometimes the food is decent but we really don't go here for the food we come for the beer and the space to eat with good company  always a mix of working professionals  family  tinder dates  etc I don't know why anyone would rate any of this food more than 3 stars get out of the house more often or put a few more miles on the odometer and find a real meal. Same as Cheesecake Factory there's just lots of calories  fats  salts and empty carbs. I would give 3.5 if I could for the beer selection and the place is always clean but just based off food 3 stars. Service is same as food  it's hit or miss
Andres S.,Anaheim  CA,524,89,55,7/23/2016,5.0,The service was great. Our server recommended amazing drinks  that we loved. I definitely like this place
Stephanie S.,Long Beach  CA,80,29,,3/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Maybe I came on an off night but this service is awful. Down south the place is amazing service is on point but up here y'all are slow and can't get my order right. Salad comes before the main course normally  extra plates come with the appetizer and when you ask if I want another Dr pepper don't bring root beer mainly not after you brought me a dirty glass previously! With minimum wage going up please get your act together cause this is no where near $15 hour service. If I wasn't so hungry after my flight I would of left.
Lisa A.,Fremont  CA,39,70,,4/9/2016,5.0,Great food. Great service. New menu. The only negative  which is true of most restaurants  it's noisy on weekends at dinner time.
Lou-Lou M.,Hayward  CA,2,2,2,1/14/2015,2.0,"Service: Came in here earlier for dinner. My friend and I got here around 6:30 pm. We only waited two minutes to get seated. But  it took 10 minutes to find a waiter to place our orders. Our food came 10 minutes later  but the waitress assigned to our section didn\'t appear until much later. She seemed nice  but for a restaurant staff servicing the dining room  she didn\'t smell clean. There was one time when my friend and I took a whiff of her body odor as she walked past us and it made us gag while chewing on our food. That\'s pretty gross.Food: We got our food rather quickly. We only ordered two dishes tonight:1) Shrimp Scampi Pasta was EXCELLENT! This dish comes with a generous amount of flavored shrimp over angel hair pasta tossed in a light  perfect blend of olive oil  butter  garlic  lemon juice and diced Roma tomatoes. They dish was topped with grated Parmesan cheese  and a dash of bread crumbs and chopped parsley. A full order is about $19  but the serving is enough to be split in two. We truly enjoyed this dish and will definitely get this at the next visit. 2) A large  hand-tossed pizza-half ""BJ\'S Favorite"" AKA The Works (Oven-baked meatballs  pepperoni  Italian sausage  mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions and seasoned tomatoes) and half ""Sweet Pig"" (best known as Hawaiian). Both flavors look good on paper  but both failed in taste and texture. Both sides of the pie were dry. Our pizza was served on a cold ceramic pizza plate-not on a hot  stainless pizza pan straight from the oven. The pizza pie/crust didn\'t taste fresh either-it got cold and chewy fairly fast. Very disappointing.Summary: The restaurant is simple and airy. The crowd is good and decent. Noise level is fair. Tonight\'s dining experience was below average in my opinion. Sign up for BJ\'s Premium Rewards online and get free stuff like BJ\'s Famous Pizookie. They give a point per dollar spent. Rating: For this visit  I\'d give it a 2/5 rating. They need more attentive wait staff or I\'d think twice bringing a family here because you\'ll wait a long time to get served. The food came quick  but we weren\'t asked even once if we enjoyed our meal. I\'ll highly recommend Shrimp Scampi Pasta. I\'m not a big fan of deep dish pizza  but I\'ll give it BJ\'s pizza another shot next time I come back here and hopefully  I\'ll have a better review then."
Giz N.,Union City  CA,2,36,1,10/4/2016,2.0,I'd give this place 2.2 stars only because their beer selection is decent. Their entrees are mediocre at best. We had their deep dish pizza and it came out cold! For an entree like that  I should expect the cheese to be melting and the crust to be hot. When I took my first bite  i noticed that the cheese wasn't completely melted and the crust wasn't even room temperature. I asked them to re-heat it and there was no change! We had the Avocado Rolls as an appetizer and it was the only decent dish we had. Service was.....mehhh. The only other saving grace with our meal was the beer. If you want good beer  come here. If you want to eat  you may want to go somewhere else especially if you want a deep dish pizza.
Guahivi M.,Fremont  CA,13,1,1,4/19/2016,4.0,Great place to have a drink. I had a shared full rack baby back rib that was so good  also ordered a broccoli cheese soup that tasted more like chip's dip (didn't like it). Kids Mac n cheese and traditional wings were dry.But in general is clean  good service and tasty.My suggestions try baby back ribs or signature deep dish pizza and come at lunch time because at night is very busy.
kashmita p.,Hayward  CA,1,9,5,4/18/2016,3.0,Food is good and the environment is nice. I barely go here  but I love going for the desserts and drinks from the bar. My cousin and I usually get a trio of the pazookies. Recently got their monkey bread pazookie and it tasted amazing. Similar to a cinnamon bun from cinnabon.
Kaila S.,Newark  CA,1,17,17,4/17/2016,3.0,The food here is pretty good  nothing really extraordinary though. The atmosphere is nice and open and spacing is great. This place is great for food but it's not a place that I would immediately want to go to if I was craving something
Nichele R.,Union City  CA,38,138,70,6/22/2016,3.0,"So I came here to do their curbside lunch delivery service which I though would be pretty convenient. Not!I go inside to pick up my order so I can continue on to work since I was on my lunch. I get to the side desk for quick pick up and I see my food just sitting there on top of the back table and the server who is assisting anyone with curbside orders just looks at me  looks away real fast as if trying to purposely avoid eye contact and then continues on sending out orders to other patrons. No ""hi welcome to BJ\'s""  no ""one moment miss I\'ll be right with you"". No  I got none of that. Just her awkwardly avoiding eye contact with me for the next 10 minutes while I\'m burning holes into her with my stare. I want her to see I\'m getting impatient. She FINALLY addresses me in a half-hearted ""one moment"" then jets off to go to another order. Umm  when it come so customer service you at least address a patron who is wasting their time and spending money in their establishment. And you most CERTAINLY assist the person right there in front of you and not someone who has not even gotten to the restaurant yet for their order. She finally checks me out for my order after waiting a grand total of 16 minutes when it was supposed to be a quick pick up. Hence the reasoning behind why they have this service in the first place. If you hate your job then change it. Don\'t take it out on the patrons going to your establishment with no smile no welcome just your bitter attitude. Yuck  where\'s a different BJ\'s at? This one lost its luster  especially after gaining some of it back after removing all the derelicts and thieves from the motel 6 that used to be in the back."
Erik E.,San Jose  CA,0,9,,4/29/2017,1.0,Poor service and cold food. We never had a dedicated server and had to get up repeatedly to find people. Don't eat here.
Sheila A.,Fremont  CA,6,11,30,11/21/2015,1.0,Complaint: waited forever for our waiter to take our order  waited for wings (40 min) and it came out wrong. And waited for $10 off coupon to be cleared by the manager (20 min). Manager was not helpful at when we complained to her.Manager  Melissa  is the worse. She needs to stop chatting away with the hostesses in the front and start helping her new employees get the hang of their new jobs. You don't throw your new hires under the bus cause that's a reflection on management and how they prepare their employees. Our waiter was new (3rd day on the job) so we were understanding on his situation. It just sucks to see that no one was looking over him to see if he was doing okay and able to handle dinner rush by himself. Our waiter tried his best but needs more training. Will come back for late night happy hour but not for dinner rush.
A J.,Fremont  CA,0,7,1,3/29/2016,1.0,"I used to love this place. Now they cannot keep up with volume. Every Time you go before your order is served your server goes on break??? And now tried take out and got served pizza with hair in it. It has turned into a terrible restaurant.-------Additional review...So a friend of mine wanted to meet for drinks and catch-up here. He was closer to the place and I accommodated and went their regardless of my disliking couple of weeks back. Yet again pathetic service level. We ordered second round of drinks and he stepped out for a smoke and I just went along. We informed our waiter. Ordered more food & drinks while we still had more food. We came back to see all of our food was gone. Person waiting our table was very aware of what happened while remaining order was getting served. However her reaction was a joke ""I guess they are too eager to clean the tables"" not even a sincere sorry came out of her mouth. This is a classic example of when business is going too well. People forget how to treat their customers."
Mark W.,Berkeley  CA,0,11,1,4/27/2016,5.0,"Very delicious!!! We ordered Medium Great White Pizza  Caesar salad with Gluten free thin crust Pepproni pizza. The food was fresh and cooked to perfection! The pizza was still warm fresh out the oven  the salad was extremely mouthwatering with the crispy croutons! Lastly but certainly not least ""The Monkey bread pizzuki ""   It literally melts in your mouth. This pizzuki is out of the world and i will definately come back for this again.Even Tuesday seems to be busy night  but service was great and fast! Kishan "" you nailed it"".Great job!! I hope to see you again. I recommend alll the beer lovers to join Bj\'s Club. Trust me you will not be dissapointed."
Patricia G.,Sunnyvale  CA,2,25,2,3/14/2017,1.0,Service was unbelievably slow. Place was full our dinner took 3 hours to complete.  Our waitress never came back for a second round of drinks  and yes...my single glass of beer did not last 3 hours. This is how businesses go out of business  I hope management reads this and addresses. The location is Cupertino is much better. I would not return to the Newark location based on this lack of service.
Denzel A.,Fremont  CA,27,5,,1/7/2016,5.0,The food was pretty good. The service was fast. I came here on a Thursday evening during the weekday  it's usually pretty slow on the weekdays. When I come here I usually get a pizza and share with my friend or girlfriend. Today was no different  I ordered a chicken bacon ranch pizza was pretty good it's always covered in toppings no complaints here. Ended the meal with a peanut butter smores pazookies. The pazookies are the best!
Kristina G.,Los Angeles  CA,1,111,8,4/25/2017,5.0,Came here Saturday night with two of my friends. Not familiar with the area so they drove us here. We asked for a booth and was given one  it was moderately busy so I'm surprised they accommodated our request. I had the jambalaya and my two friends had sirloin and rib eye. We also had beer  wings and the mushroom appetizers. We enjoyed our late dinner. Our server was a very nice young guy  we asked him if he could take a picture of us at the table and even though he was busy he still did it. We had a very nice time!
Tameeka B.,Oakland  CA,217,70,93,2/1/2016,4.0,My friends and I frequent this place quite often. We are often in a large group and BJ's is always accommodating. The food isn't out of this world but when you want to go somewhere reliable  knowing that the dish you order will be on the better side of good and the price not too steep- you go to BJ's. Their pizza's are among my favorite. They used to have a mushroom balsamic glaze pizza that was the bees-knees! Unfortunately it was rotated off of the menu  I hope they bring it back. Also  if you haven't had a pizookie  you're missing out on one of the happier things in life haha! Go to BJ's you won't be disappointed! ***disclaimer: while they're known also for the beers they have on tap  I'm not a drinker so when I say that you won't be disappointed  I am strictly speaking on food and non-alcoholic beverages***...carry on...
Morgan F.,Fremont  CA,69,99,271,4/8/2015,4.0,I go to this place for games  alcohol  and appetizers. And I love it every time! When I go  I almost always get good  efficient service. They have a huge big screen to watch sports in the bar area (seat yourself).So many of the appetizers are great. I like the ahi poke  mozzarella and tomato salad  fried artichokes  and thai shrimp lettuce wraps.This time I tried their new pepperoni pizza dip. So good. The Crostinis tasted a bit stale  but they were still worth eating.
Lin Z.,Redwood City  CA,30,5,,3/4/2017,1.0,That was awful walked in at noon left at 1:30 no food and a horrible manager that didn't even apologize. We watched all the tables around us get their food but we just had to sit and wait. Finally got up and just left. We will never go back there
Mario R.,Oakland  CA,0,7,6,4/9/2017,2.0,So my wife and I finally decided to tryout BJ's and unfortunately it was not a good experience. The wait was not bad being it was a Friday evening  we started off w/ appetizers which was calamari  and an order of a small bowl of pale ale chili w/ chips. The calamari came and I noticed the lemon had mold on the inside of the lemon wedges the waitress noticed me looking at it before I can snap a picture of it and asked if there was a problem I showed her the lemons and she apologized and got us a new order of calamari  the chili dip was not what I asked for and instead I was served a all cheese dip. I kept it to not make a big deal but our food came out rite after we had received our appetizers so I felt rushed to eat so the main course didn't get cold. The whole experience at BJ's unfortunately was not what I expected. We should have walked out after the moldy lemons I can only imagine what it looks like behind the kitchen if they're careless enough to send out obviously molded lemons imagine what goes on in the back.
Brittany R.,San Jose  CA,395,321,11,2/15/2015,4.0,Disclaimer: I used to work at BJ's San Bruno and BJ's Concord so I have a good idea of what goes on behind the scenes at BJ's and the code of conduct for customer service.I like this location because the parking is so easy (usually  but right now there is construction going on FYI) and it's also not too big but not too small. The bar is the perfect size so that everyone in the bar area has a good seat to see the TVs. I'm a big fan of BJ's food so the consistency here is definitely appreciated! Each time I get my favorites  they always taste as scrumptious as last time ;)Speaking of  my favorites are:Avocado Egg RollsBaked Mac & CheeseBlack & Bleu BurgerMaui Glazed Pork ChopShrimp ScampiClassic Combo Pizza
Michelle C.,Fremont  CA,36,16,2,11/21/2015,4.0,I've been coming to this BJ's since it opened and figured it's about time I write a review. It's been our go-to place when we can't decide what to eat since they have an extensive menu with something for everyone and the food's pretty consistent. My all time favorite has been the Ahi Tuna Salad... until recently. They not only changed how they serve the salad (ex. diced avocado vs. slices)  but they have also changed the quality of the Tuna. It used to be nice and creamy sushi-grade tuna and now it has a steak-like texture with a blah flavor. At first I thought they were just overcooking it  but the last time I ordered it (a few weeks ago) it was prepared perfectly  but still had the steak-like  grainy texture. I used to rave to people that it's the best tuna salad anywhere and now I'm sad to say that I will not be ordering it again. As for the service  it's always been pretty decent and expected for the type of place BJ's is  with a couple exceptions of course.
Allen C.,Fremont  CA,113,413,3923,6/5/2013,4.0,"Of all the BJ\'s we\'ve eaten at  this is our favorite. First off  parking is a breeze at this location. The lot is large. I don\'t usually select pork when I eat out because many places don\'t cook it the way I like  including the other BJ\'s. But our server recommended the Maui Glazed Pork Chop without hesitation so I gave it a try. It was cooked perfectly - nice grill mark  moist inside and flavorful. The potatoes would have been better if they were smaller in size but I still liked them. The green beans were blanched and unsalted for the health factor? Wife\'s Creole Tilapia was overall enjoyable except one tomato wedge was frozen solid.We got quirky and ordered the ""BJ\'s Bake Beignet"" deconstructed as we have an aversion to soggy bread. It wasn\'t the Nawlin style fried puffy beignet covered with powdered sugar. It was more like a light bun topped with cinnamon and sugar. Yum! So glad we had the strawberries and vanilla bean ice cream on the side. The greatness of the bun itself would have been masked otherwise."
Sara N.,San Francisco  CA,273,418,985,2/18/2015,3.0,I like that they could carry our bar tab over to our table. They service was pretty stellar once we were seated  the bar service just plan sucked (we were at a table  not sitting at the bar). The parking lot is 7 types of confusing and ill situated. The beers are standard to that of all BJ's establishments  and their happy hour is always busy. In fact  they are always busy at this location.We ordered for a table of 8  they made a mistake on one order and didn't charge for the item  which was nice. The beers are always tasty  and your ability to see a tv at the bar from almost anywhere in the venue is a huge plus.Think BWW meets Maggianos with a hint of pizzookie and a smidge of Chili's.
Eric V.,Los Angeles  CA,60,81,116,2/4/2016,2.0,Service  service! It is horrible. This area is happy to have a restaurant of this caliber  but the waitresses have been horrible. Tonight I am dinning and Elizabeth is our server and she is no where to be found! We are trying to get water refills and drinks and have to wait for them. Why? Last night it was Andrea  and she was horrible. I would give my review full stars  because of the food. Just wait a couple of months till the get the staff down. You are not going to like the service. Trust me.
Sophia Y.,Pleasanton  CA,221,254,660,12/28/2013,4.0,The service and food here is 10 times better than what they serve at the BJs in Dublin. Love the strawberry mojitos and cookies n cream pizookie! They also offer beer flights that are fun to try out. If you've never had their hand-crafted (unlimited refills) root beer  it is a must try! So smooth and vanilla-y  it'll make even a root-beer-hater a believer.The happy hour specials are the way to go. Calamari  avocado egg rolls and deep dish pizzas are my staples here.Sign up on their website to get a free pizookie on your birthday!
Wendy Y.,Fremont  CA,295,615,614,10/1/2014,4.0,I usually come here during the night  at around 8pm or 9pm. It's usually a late dinner and we try not to eat too much. Just like any other BJ's Restaurant  the place has full bar access  booths  and tables. This place in particular has a long wait time on a lot of times I've been here. There were times when we left because the wait was too long and it was already late. We were seated quickly this time. Our waitress came quickly and provided us with menus and waters. We scanned through the menu and decided on two appetizers and an entree. We got the chips with spinach dip  buffalo wings  and chicken pasta with angel hair. We also got two drinks: your typical Stella and a raspberry cider. The food came pretty quickly and we chowed down right then because we were so hungry. The spinach dip was so good and it warms your mouth. The dip was thick  but in a good way. The buffalo wings were great and the portion was huge! It also comes with celery and carrot sticks. The dipping sauce for the wings was a little weird for me. It was a spicy liquid-y hot sauce. The pasta was so delicious! The angel hair spaghetti was cooked well and the white sauce was great! The chicken was also very tender and juicy. Maybe I was just hungry  but everything was really good. I definitely recommend the raspberry cider though! It's one of the sparkling ciders so it's not even like alcohol. It just tasted really fruity and nice. The service was also good. Our waitress came and checked on us many times to make sure that things were going great. Other servers dropped by and asked us how we were doing as well.I don't come here much often  but the food is good whenever I come  so I am satisfied with this place. I will most likely be returning one of these nights. It's pricey  but it's expected for these kind of restaurants.
Corrin J.,Union City  CA,394,32,4,10/19/2015,3.0,Everytime I come here the service is crazy slow  we tend to always make the mistake of sitting in the bar where there are never enough servers and the servers seem so overwhelmed. My first time coming in my server was a little bit of an older Hispanic guy with a green apron  didn't get his name but he completely didn't care about us. Took his time getting to us and unfortunately he's always in the bar. Must have thought we were young kids & bad tippers (WRONG) Shouldn't give bad service! However this time I can say our server lance was very nice and polite  a little slow but overall super nice guy so we didn't mind.Food is always really good  I recommend the fries artichokes. They are surprisingly delicious! Overall food is pretty good about 4 star on that... They just need to work on keeping up with the pace of the bar!
Brian N.,Long Beach  CA,1,4,1,2/21/2016,3.0,Food overall was good but our Brussels sprouts appetizer was so burnt. It looked nothing like the ad. Get your greens some other way people. Picture posted elsewhere
B. M. C.,Fremont  CA,3,27,,11/20/2016,1.0,"This place has gone downhill in terms of service. Waited roughly 25 minutes for a couple salads that never came even though we told 3 different people we ordered two. After mentioning this to our waitress  she left and didn\'t return. Granted she was on break while we ordered from someone else first  but she stopped by when she came back from break and we asked for our salads from her. Ten more minutes later our entrees show up and Monique comes back to check on us. She asked if everything was ok. We said no  just cancel our salads. She said  ""salad? oh  what salad? The other waitress didn\'t know about a salad."" Uh.... we told you ourselves ten minutes ago so does it really matter that the breaker waitress didn\'t put it in the system? We asked for more water and apparently that takes time as well. As bitchy was I was with my blank stares  she was lucky I\'ve gotten better at controlling my hangry vocally. My husband was ready for the unleashing  though. Lol. Food was good as usual."
Sabrina C.,Hayward  CA,55,113,105,1/5/2016,5.0,Lunch was perfect. Ordered a Gourmet 5 meat deep dish pizza. Always yummy.Ordered Spinach stuffed much rooms for the 1st time  loved them. I will go back just for those. Our server was Isabella  I think it was spelled differently though. She was friendly and fast. Very sweet personality.
Jasmin H.,San Francisco  CA,188,68,238,1/3/2016,2.0,(Review is of my experience at the Newark branch only)In general  BJ's Restaurant is a decent franchise. People come here for the good food  beers on tap and the casual atmosphere. You can never go wrong with BJ's  which is why I am generously giving this branch two stars. I have been numerous times to other BJ's restaurants in east bay  and the Newark location is the branch that has given me the worst dining experience.On a weekday night (7PM) I came here with my sister who had a birthday reservation. Despite arriving on time  we were seated an hour and a half after our arrival. Mind me this is after several attempts of trying to get someone to assist us.The service here is awful. The restaurant was severely understaffed and the servers appeared overwhelmed  rude and inattentive the entire time. Our server even forgot two of our orders.Message to management: Please improve your service.
Jesenia C.,Fremont  CA,0,14,7,3/9/2017,5.0,Been here multiples times and can truly says Bj's is one of my favorite restaurants. Whether it's an intimate date night or you're coming in with all your coworkers at the end of the night Bj's has something to offer everyone. Bj's is one of those restaurants that was a wide ranging menu that will cater to everyone.   My personal favorite dish here is the seared Ahi salad (yum) if you order the seared ahi salad be sure you read all of the ingredients. The first time I ordered this salad I didn't really read the description fully and didn't realize the salad contained dollops of wasabi so I accidentally swallowed a giant dollop of wasabi thinking it was avocado lol it wasn't too bad but it definitely caught me off guard   A lot of people will complain about the wait but I really don't think it's that bad and I feel like everyone knows how bad the wait can be and it shouldn't be something that surprises you. The only real complaint I have is from the recent visit last Saturday  my date and I were sat at a regular table and this may not make sense to people who don't have tables that open up but the leaf of the table on my dates side kept unhinging and falling into his lap. However  this is the first time I've ever had a problem at Bj's and still highly recommend this restaurant.
Deborah C.,Fremont  CA,0,31,3,1/23/2017,1.0,I'm not feeling the staff or the customer service here at all! A few months ago I went here with friends. We parked next to some guy who was getting high and smoking a joint in the car next to us. It turned out that after we waited a long time to be seated  the guy who was getting high in the car ended up being our waiter! With that being said this dude could not remember anything we asked for  (more napkins  drink refills  silverware  the bill  etc)!!! Bad service. So the next time we tried this place  my husband and I went here around 4 pm. It wasn't very busy. The rude hostess who mever smiled or even acknowledged us demanded my phone number so she could text us when seating was available. Keep in mind there was plenty of seating available. So I did and asked how long was the wait. She said 15 minutes. I noticed several people who came in after us but they were seated immediately and we just sat there like idiots waiting for a text that of course we never received!!! We walked out. I won't be back. Very rude hostesses who have no skills or training in basic customer service and they have high waiters who smoke weed in the parking lot before coming into work and then forget you're there! This to me is a direct reflection on their management. No one's in charge! No one's watching the store and the employees are allowed to run game on their customers without anyone calling them out on their rude and very unprofessional behavior! It's a nice looking restaurant with a good menu but it will fold soon because of the lack of management or just straight bad management. Pay attention to how they treat you when you first arrive. It sets the tone for your dining experience. We left and went to Sizzler instead!
Claire R.,San Leandro  CA,0,6,,2/19/2017,2.0,Our food took almost an hour to arrive even though we ordered the kids' food first and then the food had been under the warmer for a very long time. The kids' juices were huge and were the only thing to arrive promptly so we ended up with hyper hungry kids. We had to ask for silverware multiple times and the server took fifteen minutes to bring drinks and take the rest of the food order. It wasn't busy and there was no obvious explanation for the terrible service at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The food wasn't bad  but next time I'll eat somewhere else.
Sara H.,San Leandro  CA,33,16,,8/7/2016,2.0,The takeout here almost always goes wrong which I don't understand. When we eat in we usually have halfway decent service  maybe a little slow at times but decent. But every time we order takeout we end up with something wrong  missing  takes way long  or something. This time my husband went to pick up a small and simple order from using their app to order. Ordered an entree salad  kids corndog  and a half pizza half salad lunch. He went to pick it up at the time designated. it was not ready. He waited and when they brought it out they were missing the half side salad. He asked them to make it. It's a simple house side salad. He waited over 10 min for them to correct it. Now by the time he got back home we all had cold  soggy food for a very expensive price.
mig l.,Hayward  CA,0,2,,3/4/2017,1.0,Whats the point of ordering online and callng ahead to have to still wait in line... went threw all the prep for no reason. Not worth ordering online or calling ahead to be seated quickly... waste of time!!!
Rajbir R.,Fremont  CA,34,111,26,12/6/2015,2.0,Wow. I have been here quite a few times and the last time I dined  I was blown away... Blown away by one of the worst experiences I have EVER received at a restaurant. I ordered the new deep dish ziti  more like a layer of ziti. For $15 I paid for 6 tiny pieces of ziti which I finished in 3 minutes. Deep dish my... Host was average. Server did not check up on us at all. The food took FOREVER. My friend's parmesan chicken was good and filling. Ordered the trio of pizookies. Got burnt cookies in larger pans  which didn't make sense. I'm not going to continue ranting  but say that you guys need to work on your service and food. I will be back and hopefully I will receive better service and food than this past experience.
Mike R.,Manhattan  NY,1,54,,10/27/2015,1.0,In our search to find a couple drinks and some food after 10pm this was one of the only places open so we decided to give it a try. When we walked in at 10:30 and asked if they were still serving the hostess was happy to seat us. our server came right over to take our order and things seemed fine. then we never got our drinks and the waitress was nowhere in sight. our food came  pizza was cold and didn't seem fresh. then when the waitress noticed our food on the table she decided to get our drinks and come check on us. food was bad  service was worse.
Jessica B.,San Leandro  CA,69,226,65,12/7/2014,4.0,Haley is the best!I have a history of having horrible service at BJs (all BJs  not any ones in particular) so I want to praise good service here whenever I come across it!Came here one busy Sunday evening with a party of 8- a few of them being foreigners with limited English. We had Haley as a waitress and she was AMAZING! Really kind and patient with our semi-difficult table. When she left to go on her break our service declined significantly so we had to talk to the manager to get her back.
Shelly F.,Palo Alto  CA,0,7,,2/27/2017,1.0,"My Burger was good! Cooked just as I ordered it  hot   fresh... BUT the SERVICE was horrible and just because of that I will never go to this place again! Our server Amber was great! She was handling multiple large tables and it was very apparent that she needed some assistance. Which I\'m not sure WHY she wasn\'t partnered up with another server since there seemed to be several servers just standing around. Anyway  the large parties were pulling her in every direction  asking for this and that  fixing orders  getting water etc. So our table asked to speak to the manager  NOT to complain about our server  but to ask if another server could help out and maybe provide better service. Well I guess this was NOT a good night to ask for the manager because Brandy approached our table with a horrible attitude. Assuming she was stressed from multiple complaint  just from what I saw (but that\'s your job right?) We began to ask if there was another server that could help and explained what was going on  she basically ignored everything we said  proceeded to tell us that this wasn\'t what was going on and so WHAT COULD SHE DO FOR US? We said get our server some help. Her response was ""well I don\'t serve  I can\'t help her and I don\'t want to argue about it"" Who\'s arguing lady?!?!?! Uhmmmmmmm you\'re the manager  you should be willing to do whatever needs to be done. Anyway this went on  the service didn\'t get any better and she basically just stayed away from the large party section so she didn\'t have to deal with EVERYONE in that section complaining.As a ""Manager"" there was a better way to resolve this issue and make everyone happy. But  I guess Brandy was just not in the mood to do her job! The entire experience sucked."
Mary D.,Fremont  CA,48,25,,2/23/2017,2.0,Dissappointed the last time I came in. Ordered chicken wings  looked more like pigeon wings and still ended paying the $11  should have sent them back. Except the restaurant was vey busy that night  and our server mentioned that there were issues in the kitchen. Orders were either coming out to slow or not at all. The Tavern pizza was a plus  and the Santa Fe salad was good.
Tamara W.,Union City  CA,0,45,4,1/11/2016,2.0,"This place has lost it pizzazz!! They have overhauled the menu and it seems like all the dishes my family likes are no longer in existence. We went on 01/02/16 around 4 and was seated right away  it was not at all that busy. After sitting in our booth for 15 minutes we had to flag down someone and ask if our waitress could be sent over. After 10 more minutes just as we start to stand up to leave she finally appears. By then we knew what we wanted to order  forget getting the drinks and coming back!!We gave her our order which included side salads and soup. Someone else dropped the side salads and soup off and rushed off so quickly  we couldn\'t tell them we had no utensils. I finally got up and walked to the hostess stand and asked them for napkins and utensils. Just as we started eating those items our food came out. So now we have everything at once.On the menu the fish and chips state that it comes with tartar and vinegar  our plate did not have it. We flagged another waiter down and asked for some ""oh did you want some?"" Ah yeah  it comes with the dish so why wouldn\'t we want it? Half that meal was ate by the time we saw those two items. I started to eat my chicken which the breading was over cooked and hardly had any lemon sauce  it was luke warm while the mashed potatoes were cold. Even after getting our meal our server did not stop by to check in on us. She walked by and we watched her fawn all over several other tables that were all seated after us. We did not receive a refill on our beverages and in the end had to ask someone else to get our check after sitting there for awhile. Our waitress brought over the check and then wanted to know how things were. When we said we were never offered refills she asked if she could get us any  ""I\'m leaving now chick!!"" She then wanted to know how everything was. Told her all our issues with our food and with her and not to expect a tip. And that is exactly what happened  no tip. I could see if it was busy but it was not at all. The place is no longer worth the hype. I will head over to Union Landing or Pacific Commons. It\'ll be interesting to see what happens when all the new restaurants open at the mall later this year."
Shawn B.,Fremont  CA,0,6,,2/18/2017,1.0,We went to BJ's restaurant in Newark California for dinner we waited about 45 minutes for our food  our dinner came out stone-cold - our server took it back and we waited a little bit for our food - never came back we walked out - what a joke never going back!!!!
Richard S.,Hayward  CA,0,4,,8/5/2016,4.0,Yummy bison burger and tatonka stout. My wife had the Mahi and shrimp. We had the Salted caramel pazookie for dessert. K- our waiter was excellent. We used the super easy app and I got some rewards points. They are always super nice here. Our menus were sticky. Everyone seems like they are teens who works there.
Arcie Marie D.,San Mateo  CA,8,95,127,8/11/2014,1.0,Back in the day  when BJs was a newer concept  they had major service issues. I feel as though they have made improvements since then  with the exception of the Newark location. I have NEVER had a good experience here. I don't know why I keep coming back expecting different. I'm in the service industry  so I tend to be way forgiving when it comes to the wait staff. But when I leave this location upset every time  it's not a good look. My first visit to this location  the manager had to comp the entire bill bc the food came out wrong. We're talking 0/4 orders correct. And cold. And I was never given my drink throughout my meal. Ever. Even after 3 requests. My most recent visit was no different. Started off with a quote for a 40 min wait. For my husband and I and my infant. On a Sunday early evening. Okay. I guess we'll wait. Then the host asked which I needed for the baby  a booster  or a highchair. My baby's 3 months old. Tiny. So I explained to her that he doesn't sit on his own yet. So neither. (He was sitting in his stroller  not carseat  so I told her i didn't need a sling either) 55 min later  they realized they had skipped over us and said it would only be 10 min more. Oookay. 15 min later (so closing in on an hour and a half wait time. For 2 people) we were walked over to a high top table in the bar area. First  that area is open seating  so if you were going to seat me there  was there a need to have me waiting for that long? And second  you're going to seat me a high top and expect me to pull up my stroller next to the table? So I'm going to tend to my baby sitting almost 2 ft higher then him? She agreed to get us a regular table. But of course we had to wait a little longer. 5 min later  she was ready to redirect us to our table and asked me to leave my stroller in the lobby. My now sleeping infant son was nestled in his stroller. So obvi I was confused. I explained to you he doesn't sit up on his own. And you can see I don't have him in his carseat and I explained that to you as well. So you're expecting me to pull him out and what  hold him the entire meal? To add insult to injury  she led me down some stairs. With my stroller. Really?? So we established the hostess had no clue what she was doing. But the food. C'mon!! I ordered a water and a beer. Never receive my water. I ordered a sandwich. And thin fries. No substations. No special nada. Straight off the menu. Still wrong. Wrong sandwich. Wrong fries. My husbands too. I paid too much money for that dinner to be leaving so unsatisfied.. I will definitely be avoiding this location in the future. Try Bridgepoint in San Mateo. I've had way better experiences at this location.
Rosa K.,Fremont  CA,17,21,15,6/21/2016,4.0,Came here for lunch on a tuesday it was packed! ordered the lunch special: grilled cheese with avocado and tomatoes and skinny fries. the food came out quick and it was delicious!
Christine S.,San Francisco  CA,1110,1204,4588,8/31/2013,4.0,When my coworker and I found out about their $5.95 lunch special (served at 11am-3pm)  we just had to try it out! Every time we've been here  the service (whether it's a server or even the bartender) has been awesome! They seem so cheerful and happy to be helping you out. We've tried a few things off the menu  and they were all tasty. The restaurant does get pretty busy  but we've been lucky to always grab a bar table. The wait for food is a bit longer than expected  so if you have a timed lunch  try to order as fast as you can! Besides the lunch deal  they also have a good happy hour. The best deal for the happy hour is the half off pizza! Yum!
AJ B.,Alameda  CA,2,23,18,8/17/2015,2.0,Worst service ever. The food took waaaaaaaaay too long to get here  even though the restaurant wasn't packed. They didn't take our plates when we finished our food. Our dessert took about an hour and a half to come. The reason for that extra 30 mins is that the food runner gave our dessert to another table by accident.Originally I put one star  but it's now two stars because they realized their mistake. They took off some money off of our bill and we got our trio and they made one of the pizookies a large size.
Monee D.,Fremont  CA,0,18,,8/4/2016,4.0,Food is good  great selection for late night pick-up  delivery or going to the restaurant itself. Ambiance is okay...lights too bright in my opinion and definitely loud no matter where you sit. But  for late night dining it beats Taco Bell and jack in the box for sure.
Kyra S.,Union City  CA,493,393,1158,10/7/2014,4.0,The food was good  we had a large party reservation and we were seated quite quickly. But when it came to using a coupon we waited forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for it to get processed. I am not sure if the girl was new or the manager or what . But overall it was a good experience with good food
Hoa T.,San Francisco  CA,4,108,28,11/5/2015,4.0,We came here on a Wednesday night around 5pm. It wasn't crowded  it got crowded like 7p.m. our waiter was very nice she kept checking on us  seeing if we needed anything or order because we were still waiting for our friend. The service was great .  We order avocado egg rolls ( they were delicious.) Deep dish sweet pig and combination( the deep dish was just okie.) Root beer wings ( I would definitely order that again  juicy tender  and very flavorful taste like root beer.) Asian chicke salad( you can't go wrong with salad.) Overall try what is new on the menu.
Jasmin V.,Fremont  CA,60,2,,1/28/2017,1.0,"Just got home from having dinner with my son tonight and I\'m feeling pretty upset about my service. My son loves this restaurant so I decided to take him to dinner there tonight. On the website there was a coupon for a free pizookie with a purchase of 9.95 or more so I was excited to redeem it. Our server JESSICA was friendly but when we asked about the free pizookie she got all weird and asked us to show her the coupon. I pulled up the website on my phone and showed her the coupon and she stayed staring at it for a while. She finally said it ""worked for her"" but when she gave us the bill it had still charged us. I let her know that we were still being charged for it and instead of just fixing it for us she made us feel super embarrassed and said it\'s probably because we weren\'t signed up for rewards or something. She just really didn\'t want to honor the coupon for us and we felt super embarrassed so we just paid for it and left. It\'s not even about the money  it was the fact that she made a big deal about a coupon that was on the website. Workers there should know the promotions going on and not make their customers feel embarrassed just for trying to use a coupon. I always enjoyed going to this bjs but after tonight I for sure will never return."
Elizabeth J.,San Francisco  CA,580,620,704,10/24/2014,4.0,Huge tv screens all over the place. Awesome spot to watch any sporing event. Awesome lunch specials  Unlimited Soup & Salad combos. Great spot for lunch. Will def come back. Fast service  food came out very quickly.
Frank T.,Oakland  CA,42,372,209,9/24/2014,4.0,Just had a lunch here. Had the honey crunch chicken salad and the clam chowder for an extra dollar.The chowder was excellent. I'm pretty snobby about CC  and this had a lot of fresh clams i.e. not chewy. The flavor was perfect  not too thick and just the right amount of cream. I would order this again in a flash.The salad was equally as good. Crunchy chicken breast over chopped salad of corn  almonds  lettuce hard boiled eggs  carrots. A wonderful salad.Service was exceptional.
Brian T.,San Jose  CA,264,24,3,7/21/2015,1.0,I went here twice now and now I know to never come back. Both times the server took 15 minutes just to check on us for our orders and on top of that about 40 minutes to get our food. It gets worst after receiving our food  our server Jesse  never checked up on us. We had to flag someone else down to find someone to find him who was just chatting up another table and this is about an hour after finishing our food. Worst service ever. definitely going to the Cupertino one instead.Update 9/13/16: Never heard back from their manager after an offer for the bad experience
Caroline K.,Castro Valley  CA,51,60,1,5/25/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Went back this Sunday and service was so much better - our server was on top of things and strangely  weekend service was way better than my previous weekday experience. The manager was responsive to the observations that I had made and it's always nice as a consumer to feel heard. The only negative thing I have to say is that the shredded lettuce was so wilted and brownish that I do wonder what QA is done before serving. But my bloody mary was awesome and dishes were cleared promptly! While i still think this location needs some work  I can appreciate that they are making efforts and that management staff is responsive!
Queena T.,Oakland  CA,74,35,25,11/11/2016,5.0,Perfect for any game day! Delicious pizzas and yummy delicious appetizers. I always tend to get their appetizers or finger food because that's one of the best  safe  comfy food to me. By all means  you can try other food as well. This is just my preferences. Don't remember much about their pastas  but it's not that bad. I found a new favorite pasta  but I forgot what's the name of it. It's like a pizza  but in a pasta instead and it comes in a pot. Great services here  checks up on you every 10 minutes or so and keeps refilling drinks. They always make sure we have a wonderful time  satisfied with our food  and experience. And if you aren't satisfy with your food or they made it not to your liking  they will try to make you another one. No  this doesn't mean you get free food. They will simply replace your food. Don't be greedy! So excellent on customer services. And all the employees there are friendly. Sadly  there's no reservations. The line can get very long and you have to wait at least 45 minutes just to be seated. But the food is worth the wait because once the food comes out  all the problems vanishes or disappeared.
Bailey D.,Roseville  CA,174,7,,7/9/2016,2.0,I am only giving this BJ's location a 2 out of 5 because those stars only stand for the food. The food is good  but the customer service is a little poor. We have been here for a an hour and have only been check on maybe twice. Our server was just chatting up with other co workers and not checking on our table when we needed something and we would ask for something and the server would never bring it. I will give the blonde Taylor  a 5 star she is awesome!!!
Gaea T.,Union City  CA,0,150,24,6/18/2015,3.0,Good food  but the service needs huge improvement. I never went to a restaurant where the appetizers arrived before the drinks.The waitress was very apologetic saying that there is only one bartender on call at that time  and that he was very busy behind the bar. Please! The bartender didn't seem to be busy at all  and if that was genuinely the case  why have only one bartender on call for dinner?In addition  he needs to improve his bartending skills; our cocktails tasted more like water than alcohol.Not impressed!
Clint J.,Fremont  CA,34,24,1,8/14/2015,1.0,"Wanted to go out for a Friday dinner with my wife  only to have one of the poorest restaurant experiences ever.Ordered a Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon - it came without salmon and had cubed chicken in it. Sent it back. Came back with the same salad  and salmon on top. Later discovered a golf ball sized clump of tortilla chips in the center of the salad.Ordered a pizookie and it came completely raw. Called over the manager and complained and he apologized and changed our check to $0. Sweet  right?Wrong. He said his ""executive chef"" would personally make us a new one  for free. Brought it home to-go because we were quite mad by this point. Just opened it and it is completely burnt to a crisp and inedible.What. In. The. Heck.BJ\'s  you USED TO BE one of our favorite places to go. Now you will be at the end of our list of choices when everything else is not an option."
Josh R.,Hayward  CA,0,1,,1/3/2017,1.0,I go here a lot with friends and family. Great atmosphere and great to watch the warriors game or any sports game when you're there. But recently the service has been lack luster and this past visit had might been my last one. Service was down right aweful. On what seemed to be not a crowded day our did not bring us plates zero napkins and never checked in on us for refills on drinks unless we flagged him or any other employee working. I've gotten coffee and asked for creamer and never got any. But what was the worst part was when we paid. We had a sizeable group of about 5 and we paid 10 dollars over the due amount. After waiting for about half an hour we had to leave since we work the next day and it's about 10:30 so we had to reach the front desk to see where our change is and they had told us he left. So he left without saying anything  no receipt  no change  nothing. So this was the final straw we will be looking for another BJ's with better service and that actually bring change back
Jennifer R.,Union City  CA,51,33,951,4/30/2015,2.0,I've been to BJ'S a few times & each time i ordered something different & i don't like it lol. They are over priced & the food isn't that great. Today i had the deep dish baked lasagna. $15 what a rip off lol. Definitely wasn't worth the price. I only ate half of it. The pizza is the only thing thats worth eating from this restaurant.
Monica B.,Union City  CA,9,85,27,3/18/2016,3.0,They can never get everything on time or right...good people but lacking that focused customer service
Sophia H.,Sacramento  CA,143,121,260,6/16/2015,3.0,I came here with my cousins and friends to celebrate my cousins MPA graduation. We had a party of 12 people and ordered some appetizers  drinks and desserts. Our first waitress was either having a bad day or just really had a bad attitude but she definitely wasn't pleasant. The manager was also very rude and later on in the night he started to come around more and put his manager face on. We really did not enjoy our night there until our new waitress Stephanie came around. She was amazing and we loved her. If it wasn't for her this review would def have 1 star. We had to repeat ourselves many times to get our drinks correct and even then they sent us the wrong lemonade twice. Lol. We probably won't be back for a while  and if we do we will keep our fingers crossed to have Stephanie wait on us again!
Athena K.,San Francisco  CA,5,44,5,3/7/2016,4.0,Had a much better experience this time. I really enjoy happy hour and the food we had was great  I love the crispy fries almost as thin as shoestring fries and that's my personal favorite. Ribs are so succulent. Sliders are big and juicy. Buffalo wings had a great sauce but the quality of the chicken itself was not so good. The service was excellent  shout out to Margarita for being quick and friendly and bringing us awesome delicious margaritas.
Mystery M.,Fremont  CA,301,534,32517,6/17/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"After my experience here at BJ\'s today for lunch  I just had to write a review update.I came to take advantage of their FREE Pizookie Day that they\'ve posted all over the web on Twitter  Instagram  Facebook and their Website. At first  I was slightly confused on how this works. While heading to BJ\'s  I put down my name on the ""Prefered Waiting List"" using the BJ\'s App.When we got there the hostess  who was really nice  told us that there was going to be a 10 minute wait. No biggy there  it\'s BJ\'s there always going to be wait. The hostess was about right  it was only about a 10 minute wait.When we were finally able to get a table  we were sited in a booth  ones that were meant for 2 people. The hostess had asked used if that was okay and we said yes because well it was meant for 2 people and we had 2 people in our party.It took a while before our waitress came to assist us and take our order. Which was to be expected because BJ\'s is always so busy no matter what time you go really. When our waitress finally came  she apologized for the wait and for taking so long to help us and take our our order. Our poor waitress seemed overworked and really tired of waiting soooo many different tables. I felt kinda bad for her because she had to wait so many tables.We ordered our food and then I had asked her about the FREE Pizookie offer that was going on today because of #BJsFreePizookieDay and she told us we had to order it online using the BJ\'s App because it was a pre order thing. So  after she took our order  I went online using the BJ\'s App and ordered the FREE Chocolate Chip Pizookie and it was scheduled to arrive at 1:30 PM.The waitress had confirmed that the kitchen had received our order of the Pizookie and that was great and all. The Pizookie came out at 1:20  ten minutes early than it said on our order but you\'d think that would be okay right? Well  no in this case it was not. The reason for the deduction of a star was because the Pizookie came out 5 minutes after our entrees arrived  therefore  I wasn\'t really able to enjoy my entree at all which was a BJ\'s Mini Lunch Special Pizza.I couldn\'t enjoy my Pizza because I didn\'t\' want my Pizookie to become hard nor did I want the Ice Cream on the Pizookie to melt. That was the sad part of my meal today  that I couldn\'t enjoy the Pizza because of the Pizookie coming right after the Pizza came.Even our waitress was like ""OMG  the Pizookie came out already? ""They sent the Pizookie out already"". ""The Pizookie came out right after the entrees."" She did apologize for that as well and told us that ""usually the pre orders come out pretty quickly"".At least next time  I know not to pre order the Pizookie until after my entrees come out so I can at least enjoy my entree first lol. But it was FREE so I guess I can\'t complain too much...Also  the Clam Chowder that came with my Pizza (you can choose from a variety of soups) was pretty good. I like the Clam Chowder Soup  it was full of rich flavor  clams and potatoes. The Pizookie was still good  and our waitress was nice and apologized for the mishaps that happened today. So  just one star knocked down  now a 3."
Rashmi P.,Fremont  CA,126,222,43,11/28/2016,3.0,The food in general is bland and nothing to rave about  but the pizookie happy hour are the only reasons my friends and I ever come here.
Jeff C.,Fremont  CA,189,249,138,6/15/2014,3.0,This is our go to place for decent American food chain. We came here recently to watch a World Cup game and the bar area was packed with fans watching on the 4x TV screen. Typically  there's always a short line here because its so popular. BJ has a rewards program thats good for small rewards like free dessert if you eat there often. Happy hour half-off prices for food means half portions. So its not really a deal. The prices for appetizers are above average  so next time I would just buy an entree.While watching the game  we got a Jerry Burst pitcher  which is easy to share with the ladies. Also got fried calamari  avocado rolls  and regular buffalo wings. They were all very good but probably could give me a heart attack. The bartender checked in on us periodically through the game and was very relaxed. All-in-all a great place for a sporting event. Its OK for general dining though since the food quality and value is hit or miss from my experience.
Javier P.,San Leandro  CA,291,492,1746,5/8/2013,3.0,I've been here 3 times already. The first time I came with my food buddy. She had told me that if we called ahead we could make a reservation. being that it was a Tuesday night I didn't think it would be busy. So we walked in and it was PACKED. We asked for a table for two. Our wait was going to be 25 minutes. In reality it turned out to be 35 minutes. As we're waiting for our table I asked for a menu. The way I see it is that if you're going to be waiting 35 minutes minus well get a head start by looking at the menu  right? I do this at every restaurant :) Once we decided on what we wanted we wrote it on a piece of paper. When we got our table and our server introduced herself. We handed her the paper where we wrote our order. By doing so we sped up the process of getting our food. As always we ordered the avocado egg rolls for our appetizer.1st time here I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich.The grilled chicken was so juicy and tender. In other words it was well made. Well stuffed with avocado with pepper jack cheese  ranch dressing  chipotle mayo and roster chili peppers. I forgot what kind of bread it came with lol 2nd time I ordered the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad.It had green onions  tomatoes  black beans  jicama  corn and bbq dressing  mozzarella cheese and crispy onion strings. I didn't like this dish much. Mostly because it had more lettuce than anything else and it didn't have much chicken. I wasn't going to pay extra for extra chicken.3rd timeI ordered the Crispy Jalapeo Burger.With 1/2 pound of angus beef  cilantro  lettuce  tomato  pepper jack cheese  red onions  baja sauce  chipotle mayo and fried jalapeo peppers made this one SPICY burger. I must of had the spicy batch of jalapeo peppers that day. I kept asking for water lolI don't have a favorite dish  yet. I'm satisfied just by ordering the avocado egg rolls as my main dish. It fills you up and every bite has avocado and has the right amount of spiciness. One thing that bothers me is why the appetizers take FOREVER. 15 to 20 minutes. I don't know if they're always short handed in the kitchen or if they make the appetizers from scratch. If they do then that explains why it takes time. Nice restaurant to hang out with friends.
Lala K.,Honolulu  HI,318,177,718,6/2/2014,4.0,Excellent customer service! The fact that they were willing to sit a party of 16 with the whole party not present. Our waitress was also a sweetheart  she catered to out every need and she was very patient. Despite being a big party  we didn't wait long for our food and our food arrived at the same time. I've always been a fan of BJ's cause I find their food to be exceptional good. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area  as well as those looking for a place to hold a huge party.
Hetal C.,Lawrenceville  GA,2,7,,11/25/2016,1.0,As much as I love the food here  the service is horrible. We went in at 9pm and ordered a party platter pazookie. It took almost 25 mins  which was fine  but when we got it they had made the wrong flavor and it wasn't warm at all. The cookie was so thin you could almost see through it. We let our waitress know and she replied with  it is what you ordered  we went on and showed her how to wasn't and all she said was oh. She dropped the check on the table without a word and left. Very disappointed!!
Shiree S.,Gaslamp  San Diego  CA,0,9,16,6/11/2016,5.0,Anthony was amazing. He was super helpful at all times and even chatted it up a bit. Melissa(manager) was awesome. She came by to check on me and did it ever so sweetly! Great place!
Christina T.,Hayward  CA,0,8,,1/6/2017,1.0,Called and the lady said there was no wait for 4 people. Got here in 10 min and they said the wait was 25 min... it's 58 min later and we just got seated. Sadly I'm not surprised in the wait. The worst!!
Izzy Q.,Fremont  CA,57,35,21,6/17/2015,5.0,I personally really enjoy this location. I'm originally from San Jose and used to go to the Oakridge mall location but I find that this location's employees are much more friendly! I usually sit at the bar and I was extremely impressed with Sergio one of the bartenders who is always there late night closing. I asked him to make me a Cantaloupe martini  a drink that I would always have at the San Jose Oakridge location. He hadn't heard of it before and i told him to just give it a shot. After a couple of tries...he nailed it!!! It tasted just like the one i used to order in SJ. I was extremely impressed! He's one of the reasons why i come back :)
Verunchik R.,Hayward  CA,51,38,6,5/13/2016,4.0,It's a good place to grab lunch  the service has been better lately  good choice of beers and ciders  big menu  lots to chose from. Hubby's calamari came out overcooked  but they took it of the bill.
Amy H.,San Jose  CA,1243,1323,2163,4/11/2013,4.0,BJs is a bunch of goodness in one restaurant  whether you want an entree or DESSERT. The place is pretty big and can get pretty packed around dinner time. Lunch would be a great time to go since it won't be as busy as the dinner crowd. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday like my friend did. She had the beer sampler.LUNCHLunch is great here because they have awesome specials that are discounted. I got the club half flatbread pizza and side salad. The pizza was the perfect size that was cut up in smaller slices. There was chicken  avacado  cheese  tomatoes and onions and it was sooo good. The salad was a nice addition and it was all for $8 or $9. I couldn't believe it because dinners are always pretty expensive. Definitely worth coming here for lunch.DESSERTPAZOOKIEEEEEE. Sometimes I just want to go to BJs for the Pazookie. If you don't already know and you have been missing out  a pazookie is a huge baked cookie with ice cream on top. An individual size can be split with 2 people. You can also get the sampler with three different flavors  such as oreo cookie  regular cookie  and red velvet. I wouldn't recommend the other crazy flavors because the regular cookie is just plain delicious. If you really want to YOLO with friends  I would get the PARTY SIZE PAZOOKIE. You can literally split it with 5 others because there is so much cookie and ice cream. The cookie is thin  warm  and gooey and the ice cream scoops just belong with it. Eat it quickly though or else you will have melted ice cream on your delicious cookie :(**TIPS**1) Lunch time is the way to go if you want cheaper food.2) Celebrate any occasion here and they will definitely accommodate you. 3) If you come here for dinner  prepare for a 30-45 minute hour wait.4) GET A PAZOOKIEEE.5) Enjoy!
John W.,Union City  CA,49,31,4,5/1/2016,5.0,5 stars for excellent customer service with our server  Kishan. He was very attentive despite a very busy night. He's prompt. He refilled our waters without us having to ask. He checked in on us just the right number of times. Food is what to except of a larger chain restaurant. Restaurant is clean.
D T.,Sunnyvale  CA,3,83,30,4/30/2016,5.0,Best ribs! Forget Texas Roadhouse and Famous Dave's. BJ's has BOMB baby back ribs  with or without sauce. Compliment the ribs with a side of baked potato and asparagus.
Lydia H.,Milpitas  CA,213,63,33,5/20/2015,2.0,Two words to summarize my review: understaffed and inadequately trained. This place has really gone down hill compared to my previous visits from previous years. I know service had always been slow  but at least they were always nice about it. We came at around 9:30 sat at one of the round tables near the bar after we got the ok from the hosts. We proceeded to wait 10 min- no menu. So we got our own menus back at the hosts stand. 10 more min- no server greeting us or asking if we wanted some waters. Some type of acknowledgement would've been nice. Another 10 min passed so we decided to order from the bartender ourselves. The rude and snobby bartender looked at us impatiently and took our order. We sat back down and voila  our server appears. I'm not going to bore you with the rest of the waiting details  as you probably have an idea from reading the rest of the reviews from other yelpers  but it continued with us flagging down the server for the basic necessities because he was obviously too busy and overwhelmed. We understand his pain  both having been in the hospitality industry  so we gave our 20% tip and bounced. This place really needs an upgrade in food and service because it's not what they used to be. The beers and atmosphere are still great  but probably wouldn't come back again. It seems like management honestly just doesn't give a fuck.
Simon F.,San Lorenzo  CA,50,497,3281,2/3/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"My wife and I had lunch here on Saturday (for some reason  my wife didn\'t want to eat at a strip club).We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (you\'re given a black pager if you have to wait).I was nice enough to go outside (this freed up a sofa for a family to use). The flies that were trailing me soon followed.Our hostess was friendly (my wife just noticed that she was wearing too much eye shadow- maybe she was trying to look like a wolf).We were seated in the large room on the left (the only other time we were seated there was during the grand opening).I had to ask for place settings.The tables weren\'t fully set up yet.Our server was young and clearly new.He was also light (he could get blown away by a stiff breeze).Anyway  he was attentive  but annoying (I found him to be a major pest at first).We left him a nice tip ($9.81)  but I have to say that it was because we didn\'t have any singles (our total was $50.19  and so a tip of $4.81 would have seemed a bit harsh).At one point  a manager came by to check on us.He was nice  and was in the area a lot (a group of about 10 suddenly arrived- they were pretty loud).As usual  I enjoyed the songs playing inside (ex: ""Chloe"" by Grouplove).yelp.com/biz_photos/bjs-:The TV at the bar was turned to 4 different things. It was dumb  largely because only 2 games were on.(My wife groaned when I had us switch seats. I wanted to face the TV that was closest to us.)yelp.com/biz_photos/bjs-:If you redeem 150 points  you get ""$10 Off Any Meal (excludes alcohol  gift cards  tax and gratuity).""Note: All prices include tax.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjs-:My Pink Lemonade was $3 (there are free refills on soft drinks).yelp.com/biz_photos/bjs-:Mozzarella Sticks ($8.67): 9/10.My wife and I each had 4 right away. Our mozzarella sticks  as usual  were wonderful.My wife likes the marinara sauce too  but only had a little.BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich ($11.94- the price was $11.25 in 2011): 8/10.My wife is always pleased when she orders one.She ate her sandwich quickly and received a good serving of wedge-cut seasoned fries.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjs-:Pepperoni Extreme (Mini- $11.45): 8.25/10.I should have ordered a Small (for $15.21).Still  I was very pleased overall (I could have received more pepperoni  and the edges of the crust were lightly burnt).Next time  I\'m going to try BJ\'s Hand-Tossed Pizza: ""Our delicious thin crust is lightly brushed with garlic butter and topped with the perfect combination of bold tomato sauce  our signature five cheese blend and your favorite gourmet ingredients  then baked to crispy perfection.""yelp.com/biz_photos/bjs-:BJ\'s Bacon Cheeseburger ($8.67): 8/10.They\'re new.Description: ""On a grilled bun with Applewood smoked bacon  cheddar cheese  tomato  lettuce  pickles and our special burger sauce.""I didn\'t receive any ""special burger sauce "" but that\'s cool with me.It kind of fell apart  but my patty was very tasty.My crispy-thin fries were pretty good (I just had to add some salt)  but somewhat cold.If we weren\'t pressed for time (my parents were watching our son)  I would have complained about them.My bun was nicely grilled  and my cheese was delicious and gooey.I only received 2 strips of bacon  but they were quite meaty.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjs-:BJ\'s Famous Pizookie: White Chocolate Macadamia Nut ($6.49): 8.5/10.Our Pizookie was a shade overcooked  but otherwise delectable.The scoops of vanilla bean ice cream were bigger than normal.Regular pans were used in the past (tin pans are now used).The Pizookies here were a bit better in the past. Still  I highly recommend them.I laughed right before we left.A guy got hit in the head by one of the revolving doors.He wasn\'t paying enough attention (he was embarrassed  but otherwise fine).The parking lot should be fixed up a bit.It\'s pretty ""ragged.""For the most part  my wife and I really enjoyed our food.youtube.com/watch?v=vUHt"
Marie R.,Redwood City  CA,1,9,13,11/11/2015,4.0,Came here with family for the 1st time. Food was delicious. Place was full had to wait a while but it was worth it.
Jaime T.,Milpitas  CA,84,38,226,9/3/2014,4.0,This place is wonderful for group gatherings.  This is always the destination of my sport banquets. We cram in and the staff still manage to satisfy us as well as maintain a smile on their faces. The food is alright.  I prefer the appetizers over the actual meals. And the pizookies are to die for! They are a must when you visit.
Ben H L.,Santa Clara  CA,302,1556,73,2/23/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"I came back here with two coworkers to try them out again. In some aspects  the meal that I had here was a lot better but a few things bothered me like my experience last time.First of all  my meal was way better. Once again  I ordered off the lunch menu and got a lunch portion-sized of the BJ\'s Cobb Salad for $9 along with a side of Tomato Bisque soup for only a $1 more. The soup portion is quite large so it\'s quite the deal and there\'s plenty in there to share with someone else too. In terms of taste  the soup was decently seasoned although I wish it was a bit more creamy. The BJ\'s Cobb had turkey  bacon  avocado  and bleu cheese dressing mixed with romaine lettuce. It\'s a chopped salad so the lettuce as well as the other elements on the plate so don\'t expect leaves of romaine on the plate.Secondly  like last time  there were a few service issues that were a bit irritating. Unlike last time  we got our food and drink orders in relatively quick after we sat down. I ordered iced tea for my drink and I noticed that there was no sugar on the table nor was there an offer to bring me lemon with some sugar with my drink. It was a bit surprising as I didn\'t think that I needed to remind my server that I wanted lemon with my iced tea...that\'s something that I expect my server to ask me. My server also didn\'t smile during our whole experience too...I know that\'s sort of nitpicking and that everyone can have bad days and moods but I used to be in the service industry too! Flash that ""fake"" smile for me!...don\'t really want to see a grumpy face from someone who\'s waiting on me.Overall I still enjoyed my meal with my coworkers and it was an improvement overall since the last time I was here. Hopefully the next time I come here  I hope the service aspect of my meal improves a bit."
Brook B.,San Francisco  CA,1,8,,6/7/2016,1.0,I came here tonight for my nephew birthday celebration and I must say very disappointed!! I normally visit the one in San Bruno Ca and had no problems even with the crowd. My husband steak had to be sent back three times. The waiter and servers were all over the place. Time we got our food it was time for us to go where he didn't even want his dinner.Then we asked for our bill and that took even longer to receive. It's sad how this particular BJ's put a bad taste in my mouth moving forward. Hopefully they get more help and pay attention to detail.
James L.,Las Vegas  NV,49,12,3,3/19/2016,5.0,After a long day at work  it's nice to wind down with a beer flight. No matter how busy this place gets  I always seem to get excellent service. I like the light fair menu  especially the Korean Tacos. Never had a pazookie  but I heard that they are really good there.
Jeanette E.,Fremont  CA,70,20,4,3/13/2016,4.0,Called ahead for 3. Only had a 15 min wait. Restaurant was a bit loud. Sat in Jennifer's section. She was sweet and got our order in. We ordered the pasta alfredo  classic burger and the roast beef dip. Apparently there was an issue with the kitchen because I had to return my roast beef twice because the meat was cold. I understand the first time  but twice? The manager came out and apologized and all was good. But when I returned it the second time  he was mortified. I felt bad because maybe it's suppose to be cold. Nope  it's suppose to be hot. Anyway  third times a charm and again the manager and Jennifer apologized for the issue. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 2 or 3 because of how it was handled and they did comp the mistake. Can't give a 5 stars  because hey there was an issue. Overall  we had a pleasant visit and will return. Sadly I forgot to give my BJS rewards #
Maggie C.,Los Angeles  CA,137,8,,5/9/2015,2.0,Every single time my coworkers and I come  the service is terrible. We always have to wait a minimum of 10 minutes before our server comes by our table. Another 10 minutes before we get our drinks. Another 20 minutes before we get our food. Don't get me wrong  the servers are actually really nice  but they just never stop by the table. Order everything at once because if you want to place another order  it'll take at least another half hour. Also  last time we were here for a friend's birthday and after waiting over half an hour for our pizza  the pizza was served cold. What the heck? Of course we sent it back. When he brought it out the second time  he didn't bring any plates or silverware. We came late that night and there weren't that many tables. If it was busy  I'd understand  but c'mon. I honestly think chain restaurants like this need to up their game. There are a lot of booming restaurants that have excellent service and great food. I've been to BJs a dozen of times and every single time  the service doesn't change.
Edwin B.,Emeryville  CA,4,30,17,9/23/2015,5.0,Very enjoyable experience. I considered giving only 4 stars because of the deplorable whisky selection  but everything else was so good  they get 5.BJ's is my JAM  and Katherine H. is my Peanut Butter. (Katherine H. was our dining experience associate.)
Scott R.,Fremont  CA,23,19,3,6/22/2016,1.0,Very poor food today. I would avoid. Ordered the Italian Market pizza and it looked terrible. Hardly any meat on it and looked sickly compared to the menu picture. Cook was rushed obviously but quality NOT quantity is what keeps customers happy! If I could add pics I would.
Raj G.,Fremont  CA,0,75,291,12/8/2015,4.0,BJ's is probably the second best place in the Bay area for beer. They have over a dozen beers on tap plus they always have a seasonal beer on hand. The food is pretty good too including their chicago style thick crust pizzas. You can even customize and make your own. The chicken Lettuce wraps is my favorite for appetizer - light and not too filling.....yes  you need to budget space for some great tasting beers! And do not forget to end your evening with a Pizookie! Yummylicious!There is always a waiting period after 6 PM so call in advance to get on their phone list to save waiting time once you arrive and check in and collect your buzzer.
Ambar C.,Los Angeles  CA,414,376,2258,12/28/2012,3.0,I've been to a few different BJ's now. They have a decent beer selection  and their pazookie things are yummy. I took my sister to this particular BJ's to celebrate an important milestone in her career. I was exhausted  so I only ordered a 5oz IPA. She ordered some fruity cocktail drink  and we both split the pazookie mini trio. I was satisfied with the IPA  but it was nowhere near the best IPA I've ever had. Trust me  if it were really good  I would have ordered another glass. Anyway  onto the pazookie trio. We got mini pazookies in peanut butter  cookies and cream  and regular chocolate chip. The peanut butter pazookie was very rich and had an intense peanut butter flavor - definitely crunchy peanut butter. The cookies and cream was probably my favorite. It came with a chocolate cookie with white chocolate chips with a cookies and cream whipped topping. The regular pazookie came with a regular chocolate cookie and vanilla ice cream. Overall  I was happy with the dessert. The bartender was very nice  but he wasn't especially attentive once he found out we only came in for dessert.
Ashley D.,Fremont  CA,15,6,14,10/2/2015,5.0,"Went here thursday night and it\'s pretty busy took as a while to be seated but it\'s fine because the food was bomb! And service is really good the guy who served us was so accommodating :) also the price is not ridiculous i really love the dessert ""Thumbs up"" i\'ll definitely be going back here."
Stuart M.,Hayward  CA,7,54,36,2/24/2015,5.0,Never been disappointed at any of the BJ establishments. They have great food and they beer on tap is delicious! Always order there specialty pizzas paired with their blonde ale.
Paul T.,Moline  IL,29,158,202,2/16/2015,3.0,"BJ\'s is a casual restaurant chain that does better than most. They offer a diverse menu  craft brews and a full bar. The food is for the most part consistent and the service at this location has improved over the course of the past 12 months.They feature over 120 menu items that include calorie estimates. There are several ""EnLIGHTened"" entres  salads and lunch specials which range in calories from 460-850. Some of my favorite menu items include:-- Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi (460 calories); oven roasted mahi-mahi served over stir-fried vegetables and roasted pineapple fried rice. The mahi-mahi is always cooked to flaky perfection and the fried rice is almost as good as Benihana\'s without all the buttery guilt. I suggest asking for soy sauce and Sriracha hot sauce on the side if you want to kick things up a notch !! This dish pairs well with a glass of Barefoot Chardonnay; not too expensive and on point ($5.95 glass/$20.95 bottle.)-- BJ\'s Favorite Mini 6"" Deep Dish Pizza (~753 calories); Housemade meatballs  pepperoni  Italian sausage  mushrooms  green bell peppers  black olives  white onions  and seasoned tomatoes. I\'m actually not a fan of deep dish Pizza in general  but these are good and not particularly heavy. This dish pairs well with your favorite brew."
Rela S.,Fremont  CA,47,127,74,1/19/2014,5.0,"We came here for the 49ers game and the staff did a great job of taking care of us. On game days they offer happy hour specials throughout the duration of the game. The specials were definitely a great deal and they had a good selection of drinks and food. Some items included:Happy Hour Specials:$4: All BJ\'s craft beers  Flatbread pizzas  boneless wings$5 House Beers  Freshly Muddled Mojitos  Martinis  Spinach Artichoke Dip  Chicken Pot Stickers  Angus Beef Sliders$6: 4 Different Types of Wines  Chicken Lettuce Wraps  Santa Fe Spring Rolls  Avocado Egg Rolls  Mini Deep Dish PizzaKeep in mind the Happy Hour specials are ""Happy Hour-Sized"" so much smaller than their usual portion sizes. I got the flat bread pizza and there where 4 small slices of pizza. It was pretty tasty though. The chicken lettuce wraps were a pretty decent size as well.One other thing to keep in mind is the happy hour specials ONLY APPLY TO THE BAR area. Not sure if this rule is for game days or everyday. But when we went they only offered the specials at the bar. We picked up a few drinks while waiting for our table and brought them over once the table was ready.Overall a great place to watch a game. I think next time we\'ll just hangout at the bar. The energy was much better on that side of the room :)"
Anonymous U.,Watsonville  CA,0,4,3,10/29/2016,1.0,Worst service I've ever had. When I walked in the girl at the front was rude and didn't even greet us and when we were told to wait for seating she didn't give us a time of wait. The workers stand around gossiping and when we we're sat at our table the girl didn't even talk to us and our waitress took 10 min to bring us coffee and 10 more minutes to bring sugar for our coffee and our food took forever to come! Bad service!!! DO NOT come here
Ashley W.,Dallas  TX,87,6,2,10/28/2016,2.0,I called in around 5pm on Friday and spoke with someone about happy hour. I asked if they offered happy hour and they said yes until 7pm. I asked if it was in the bar only or in the entire restaurant. I was told it was in the whole restaurant. We came in around 6:30pm and I asked to see a happy hour menu. The hostess told me our server would have one. We were seated in the regular dining room. When the server came by I asked to see the happy hour menu and he told me happy hour wasn't available in the dining room. We were already seated and told that they could not do happy hour outside the bar. The whole reason we came early in the evening was for happy hour and then we were seated where it wasn't offered. I wanted to move to the bar but didn't want to make a scene. Ultimately the food was good. I had chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The chicken and potatoes were hot but the broccoli was not. Overall I am not satisfied with this experience.
Alea F.,Castro Valley  CA,54,13,,5/14/2016,4.0,The food is great  the service is usually good  and the drinks are really good. An awesome place for a great family dinner! The atmosphere is very good and is great for conversation.  Overall very worth coming out to!
Ralph P.,Los Angeles  CA,2,28,2,4/3/2016,2.0,Caution...do not order delivery if you are (a) hungry or (b) don't have money to burn. I have eaten in and the food is generally pretty good. Tonight I felt like delivery. The order took an hour and a half. It came with no utensils or condiments (we were at a nearby hotel). The food had been jostled around in the containers so that it looked like trash upon arrival. It was so over salted  I thought I would not be able to eat it  but I was starving  so I did and now I believe my blood pressure has hit an all time high! The delivery and service charges for three items were over $12.00! Room service would have cost about the same  would have been much faster  and probably better.
Dvn M.,Palo Alto  CA,0,3,,11/21/2016,1.0,It is my birthday today. An old friend took me out to lunch and we ended up goin here. Started great  everyone was nice and greeted us and service was up to par. After we get our appetizers  one of the servers decided it was a good idea to bring us a large saucer of sriracha and instead of serving it from the open-side of the bar  brought the saucer in between my friend and I. The server slipped and now my friend and I are covered in spicy hot sauce. our ties   shoes socks  all smeared in the bright red shade of rooster sauce. The manager tried to make things better by offering to comp me for the meal (was nice of him)  but what this rant is about is when the server who dropped the sauce opened the door to enter the kitchen  let out a loud chuckle and started to tell her friends  all before the door closed behind her. Spicy sauce has penetrated me dress pants and now is burning my inner thigh. thanks bjs'.........
S G.,Alameda  CA,0,99,7,8/15/2015,2.0,The worst customer service EVER!!!I was about to make my own food.lol.I had to find my waitress and have her take my order.The restaurant was extreme loud  made it hard to talk with people at our table. The food deserves 5 stars.
Laura F.,Millbrae  CA,3,55,172,1/12/2015,1.0,Had avocado rolls at the 10pm happy hour. Both myself and my date became very ill after we left. Service was just ok...
Amber E.,San Jose  CA,3,15,3,12/20/2014,1.0,"Take out waitress was dry heaving. When I asked about the poor thing I was told ""they really need all people on staff."" I\'d rather have slow service."
Jason M.,San Jose  CA,101,198,200,1/8/2015,4.0,Burgers are delicious!I came here not knowing what I wanted the waitress recommended a burger wow what a good choice this burger was fantastic  toppings just the right amount everything was great. I tried two of the beers  I can't say that I'm a big fan of BJ's beers  they are kind of off. but the food so far great.
Lynn C.,San Francisco  CA,213,483,2020,4/9/2014,3.0,I seriously haven't reviewed this place? I visited this place about 4 times since it opened. I've ordered the shrimp pasta. Really good. They always give really big portions. I never get around to trying their pizookies because I'm always too full. Their beer is great and service is always up to par. I will definitely come back to try the meats and hopefully pizookie next.
Dave K.,Hayward  CA,1,33,13,4/17/2016,4.0,Food is ok but I gave it a four for the selection of beer  number of tv's around the place playing nba playoff games and for the Sun afternoon manager who was great. She really cared about the customers that came in and super attentive.
Lauretta K.,Fremont  CA,41,27,,12/27/2014,3.0,We usually avoid this place because they're service is slow.Last night we went because they have cash ahead seating (amazing!).Service was great  food was decent... I got the grilled chicken Alfredo  there was something not chicken in there  not sure what it was but I moved it to the side and kept eating. They didn't even give me crap when I asked for extra sauce and to add mushrooms.After this visit I won't hesitate to go back.
CJ C.,Newark  CA,0,33,9,4/2/2016,2.0,This place is bad to a point that there WIFI is not working  food is even worst cold and tastes bad our server is crazy  coming asking are you ready to order after we told him give us 10 mins we are having appetizers  then he comes back after a min with the same question hahah. And the worst part is the whole floor is slippery and oily so watch out your steps . Beer was very good that's why they get 2 stars
T C.,Oakland  CA,113,785,309,1/7/2015,5.0,I really should be on a commercial for BJ's... no one in this world loves this place as much as I do. No one I say! Be it a cobb salad  pizza  burger  tacos..whatever.. it's always good. I have never had bad service or a bad meal at any BJ's Brewhouse in all the land. Ever!If there's a BJ's around  there I am...Not every day but  when I get a hankerin for good food and drinks and some good ole fashioned chain restaurant food that also happens to be delicious!
Reece R.,Newark  CA,0,10,,11/9/2016,4.0,I love getting the rack of ribs when I have a big enough appetite. otherwise the chicken tortilla soup and the mozzarella salad is great  if you get there early enough on the right day you can even get the unlimited soup and salad. I've had the pizza from here a few times now but it never quite hit the spot except for the appetizer flatbreads those are great
Carolina A.,Palo Alto  CA,102,16,1,3/27/2015,2.0,"So tonight we came in to celebrate my little sister\'s 16th birthday ( we were only a party of 4) But we called in ahead of time/early just because its friday and we knew it would be busy. We only waited 15-20 mins which was AWESOME!Our waitress was really nice and wonderful and took our orders and brought our drinks in a timely matter. But why the two stars? well  the birthday girl ordered a burger and it only came with ONE bun.Two young girls came to give us our food  one of them almost hitting me in the face with the plate that was given across the table ( I\'m a calm person so I just ignored the rudeness) and the other gave the birthday girl her plate with ONE bun and said"" unfortunately you only have one bun"" and then left.I looked at my sister just to clarify with her that we actually heard that right.Then I thought  ""oh maybe she went to go get the other bun""  because  you know  we ordered a burger  and last time I checked  burgers came with TWO buns.But the girl never came.And at this point my blood started to boil. But my sister (being the sweetheart that she is) tried to just go with it and attempted to eat it  but today is her birthday and being her older sister  I was NOT having that.Our waitress finally came back and I relayed the appalling event that just occurred. She was shocked  apologized quickly  and got my sister a bun. I cant say I\'ve worked in foods or can deal with the things they go through  but I don\'t think its difficult or rocket science to put a bun on top of a effing burger....I really appreciated our waitress and I appreciated her apology even though she was not at fault. I hated that she felt that she needed to apologize for something that she did not do. So waitress  YOU ROCK! I wish your co workers had the same work ethics as you do. And to the management  Please train your staff on how to deliver good customer service  IDK how tired you might be  there is no excuse for such rudeness. Your front desk and waitresses are great but we will not be coming back again. Ive had better service at the BJs in San Mateo so I think I shall continue spending my money there."
Anjali S.,San Jose  CA,0,11,5,5/16/2016,4.0,The food here is amazingly good. My family and I usually come especially for the deep dish pizzas and the pizookies. BJ's is known for their pizookies as their signature dish  which is a warm cookie topped with ice cream and they are always fresh. Their pizzas are always loaded with toppings and cooked perfectly. One downside is that this place is always crowded so it is very hard to get a table during evening hours and weekends and usually the waiting is a couple of hours. I highly recommend this place for once in a while outings as the waiting times and prices are not suitable for weekly dinings.
John B.,San Francisco  CA,4,27,1,8/3/2015,5.0,I don 't like giving out 5 stars  but this place earned it.I went in twice over the weekend. This place is awesome in almost every conceivable way. The dcor and cleanliness  the service and friendly attitude of the staff  the food  even the menu is awesome.Gabby was my server both times and she did a phenomenal job.You don't sacrifice anything here. The food is amazing and authentic  the prices are good and the environment is cool.
Radostina S.,Cupertino  CA,408,92,7,5/7/2015,3.0,The service was pretty good. Our avocado egg rolls were burnt. Tasted ok still. I got the santa fe salad and that thing is sooo good. I highly recommend it.Last time I was here I ordered the parmesan chicken with broccoli and there was no broccoli.Overall  the service is good but the kitchen slacks a little when it's super busy. Wait times are also no fun.
Zoey S.,Union City  CA,126,72,125,11/24/2015,3.0,"I\'m probably the only person not a big fan of their ""deep dish"" pizza which deep full of dough. I only come here when my fianc drags me. I wish they would revamp their menu and include more selections with less sodium. Giving three stars because the service is good here but unfortunately the food keeps me away."
Jhet S.,San Ramon  CA,28,9,,9/18/2016,5.0,"I celebrated my birthday here today and to share with you guys... You should come here and celebrate your occasions or just to eat and have fun with friends or families. When I booked my reservation  I spoke to the manager ""Jordan"" and he was so accommodating and very helpful as to what I should order for the party of 35. He even emailed me and called me 2 days and the day before my event to make sure that everything is ok. His very professional and very friendly. Even the 2 servers are great  always smiling and always make sure that everyone gets their drinks and needs. My friends and families are so delighted with their experience here. Buffet table was presentable and organize. Jordan kept coming back to ask if everything is ok. I\'m a very meticulous yelper and this time I want to give BJ\'s a FIVE STAR the servers and most especially Jordan the Manager. Good Job guys! We are definitely coming back."
Jennifer M.,Reno  NV,5,33,13,3/19/2016,3.0,Not much to say... They are all the same. I had the Santa Fe salad which was good. I did a tasting of their draft beers; The harvest Hefeweizen  oasis amber  Jeremiah red ale  nutty brewnette. I recommend doing a tasting. They are all pretty good but nothing really amazing. Red ale is pretty good. It was very busy but they sat is pretty quick and the waitress was sweet and personable.
Melissa M.,Phoenix  AZ,0,91,5,4/1/2016,2.0,I had a serious pregnancy craving for their spinach and artichoke pizza. Unfortunately  our server was in lala land when she took our orders. Both my husband and I's orders were wrong. We never received refills on our water glasses. We wanted dessert  but by the time she finally came to the table we just wanted to leave. Really disappointing experience!
Vi T.,San Francisco  CA,1208,330,1267,8/28/2011,3.0,Get's craaaazy effing packed on weekends.The pizza gave our entire group stomach aches and questionable bowel movements.Lost my pizookie virginity here. Yum.Cupertino's BJ's is better.
P snacks A.,Los Gatos  CA,3,56,2,9/1/2016,1.0,suks bad sevice and slow waiters .......if any waiters
Ana A.,Fremont  CA,84,4,1,9/12/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Size they promote are not the sizes they give you. We went there for a bday and we ordered crispy calamary  and to our surprise the serving size was really small. We called the manager and they said that was how they always served it. Overall  we where disappointed about the size of our food  it was not even that cheap.
Jag S.,Hayward  CA,5,18,3,12/9/2015,3.0,We tried bjs yesterday. The service was excellent but food was so so. The chicken was over cooked. Also their artichoke dip was not even average. I gave them three stars just because of service.
L C.,Fremont  CA,0,20,1,3/25/2016,4.0,Thanks to BJ's for accommodating my party of 40 which turned into a party of 75 on a late night Saturday evening. Although we waited a bit even with reservations  the staff tried to accommodate us as much as they could on such a crowded evening. They were able to get us 50 seats and the rest of the party found spaces in the bar to hang out. One table was for 30 teenagers. The waiter assigned to that table deserves kudo's. He basically had to take care of the whole table by himself. By the time he was able to get drinks to everyone  refills were being asked of him from the first people he served. Poor guy!! BUT  he kept up his great attitude with a smile. In fact  although his name was Michael  they kept calling him Charlie Puth (the singer) cuz he looked exactly like him. With his calm and super nice nature  he made waiting for the food bearable.The other two tables were taken care of by another gal. She seemed overwhelmed a bit and then another totally cool server came by and helped out. Tips for late night big parties? Make reservations. Don't do individual orders - do the big party meal where everyone gets the same item. Don't forget to order the humongous pizookie! It'll be devoured.
Angelique M.,East Bay  CA,357,239,1249,12/26/2013,3.0,Food is same like every other BJs. But the service was aweful. Our waitress hardly came to our table and she gave our food to the table next to ours. And it wasn't just our waitress it was the rest of the waiting staff. They kept mixing orders left and right.I will say the other times I have been here the service has been on point. Tonight was just not their night.
The Food L.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,20,284,576,5/21/2015,4.0,What a gigantic restaurant with massive parking lot !!! Not sure who was providing bad service  I found everyone very friendly. I got the impression that it's a very popular among the locals. I wouldn't mind going back if I had to. Desserts are fabulous but I regretted for those extra calories!!! They list all items with calorie count - pretty awesome.
Jay G.,East Bay  CA,441,534,487,12/7/2013,3.0,A friend wanted BJ's... To celebrate his graduation from college and hangout before moving back to SoCal. So  we ended up at the Newark location to do just that!Accompanied by my friend and bro in law  we came on a busy Friday night. Even the bar area was packed. No matter what way we went (waiting for a table at the bar or main dining area) we were going to have to wait. Luckily  for us we found a party at the bar that was just leaving after our 10 minute arrival. Our ordering was very simple. We just had to order what was necessary for celebrating a congratulations/going away occasion:- Buffalo wings with buffalo sauce on the side- Artichoke dip- Blue Moon beers- Hennessy shots The buffalo wings were crispy  yet tender. To control the heat of the buffalo sauce  we had it on the side because not everyone could handle the heat. The artichoke dip was nice and creamy. It was served warm and made our tortilla chips taste great. I didn't drink beer since I can't have any  but I did have my fair share of Hennessy shots. This place is good for sporting events  but since BJ's is a popular place in the area be prepared to wait.
Chris B.,San Francisco  CA,26,58,106,1/17/2015,1.0,I've given this place several tries and each time they seem to disappoint. Slow service  messed up orders  and sometimes rude wait staff. The food is below par and don't even think about taking it home in a doggy bag. It honestly tastes like dog food the next day. I've ordered the roast beef dip (take out) and it was the worst sandwich ever. The roast beef was dry and hard and not edible whatsoever! A lot of times  if your seated at the tables your food will come out at different times then the person you came with. Pictured here is the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and a quinoa salad. I thought it was going to be good so I ordered an extra pita taco. Unfortunately it was not good. There was no flavor and it was very bland  not to mention the order was messed up as well. I've come to the conclusion that I can get better food elsewhere  I will not be back.
Gia M.,Fremont  CA,21,13,22,8/4/2015,3.0,I immediately liked the atmosphere when I entered BJ's. Though it was quite dark  it was very lively inside with a lot of TV screens  and families  and friends dinning  and the place was very big. A lot of people may find this annoying as orders may tend to be slow  but our waitress was very attentive and made sure our orders were taken and delivered promptly. I also like how diverse their menu is  there's always going to be something for everybody.We ordered all appetizers for dinner. We tried the Sliders  Chicken Wings  Crispy Calamari  and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. The Sliders and Crispy Calamari were yummy  but nothing out of the ordinary. I felt like you could order the same thing else where and it would taste the same. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were also just okay. It was tasty  but I felt like it could have tasted better. I wasn't really impressed until I tried the Chicken Wings  which we all loved! It was /that/ good that we needed to order another plate to share! The skin was crispy and the meat was just moist and it easily slid off the bone. You know chicken wings are good when they don't need to be dipped in sauce!For dessert we had the Cookies n Cream Pizzookie-- chocolate and Oreo cookie that's a size of a small pizza  topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream  caramel syrup  and chocolate chips. This was reeeaaally good! I love dessert  but the not-too sweet kind  and though this may sound like a mouthful of diabetes  it wasn't! The sweetness was just right and I really enjoyed eating this down to the melted ice cream. Of course you gotta share this  unless you want 1200 calories all to yourself (I won't judge).
Julie P.,San Jose  CA,22,4,4,4/13/2016,4.0,Love the raspberry lemon drop and the jambalaya! Great food/atmosphere and service keep me coming back! And the pazookies are amazing!
Andrea P.,Hayward  CA,232,2,1,12/21/2015,2.0,"A girlfriend  S and I were out spending the day Halloween shopping and dinner got pushed back because of it. We found refuge at BJ\'S around 10 pm and stopped for a late dinner. My salad and wine were amazing. S  however did not enjoy her salad. When we told the server  I think her name was Melissa  she very hesitantly offered to take it away which made S feel uncomfortable so she kept the salad and never took another bite. We then proceeded to order our meals. When they came out  S\'s meal had been prepared entirely wrong which was immediately visibly apparent and we voiced it as such. The food runner apologized and excused herself to fix it. I then started on my meal to find that my Spaghetti and Meatballs(which I specifically ordered without chili flakes due to an allergy) was COLD. I called over Melissa and explained my problem. She then proceeded to stick her fingers into the plate of Spaghetti right in front of me at the table. As a server myself  I was appalled! She offered to have a new one made and I obliged. In the meantime  as we\'re having these problems  the manager  Brandy(?) Is standing in the to go area as Melissa acts as our messenger between management and the table. And what is Brandy doing? Putting away boxes and chatting. S is a restaurant manager and I have worked closely along management as a server for years. We were both extremely shocked to have not been visited by a manager at this point. So  time goes by and we receive our remade meals. S\'s comes out wrong yet again  and mine has chili flakes. I take one bite and I\'m on fire. So  we call over Melissa yet again. Tonight just isn\'t our night and we\'d like to pay for what we enjoyed from our terrible experience and hit a drive thru somewhere. She makes a trip back to Brandy and returns to our table with a check charging us for everything and still no visit from Brandy. That\'s when I asked Melissa what the manager\'s name was. Only after that did we get a visit from her.She walked over  already familiar with our situation and started going on about how busy she is and how she\'s the only manager and how she\'s stuck doing to go\'s.NOT OUR PROBLEMWe sat in disappointment watching her for at least 20 min waiting for a visit before we actually received one. And her ""being so busy"" entails talking and laughing with her subordinates and putting away to go boxes and bags. I have always enjoyed my excursions to BJ\'S and make a point of visiting several of the locations in the bay area frequently. To say the least  S and I were extremely disappointed with our experience and I feel extremely hesitant to return.... I sent this to corporate and never got a response."
Carmik T.,Gilbert  AZ,66,373,692,1/28/2014,4.0,Dinned there on 1-24-14 about 8:30 PM. Place was busy had about a 20 minute wait  not bad for a Saturday Night.Food and service was good.We are fans of the menu  always enjoy eating at BJ's.Great kid menu items as well.
Madhur B.,Stanford  CA,190,225,489,3/3/2014,5.0,Man  I love this place. I find the general food style to be very similar to Cheesecake Factory  with the vibe being a bit more upbeat. I really don't understand how they manage to make the incredibly simple concept of ice cream on a cookie taste so unbelievably delicious. My recommendation: Cookies & Cream. That whip cream with the ice cream and cookie is the greatestPeanut ButterOriginal Chocolate ChunkAside from the desserts  I'm a BIG fan of the food as well. Some recommendations:Avocado egg rolls - Similar to Cheesecake factory's  yet somehow distinct. Love it. Chicken Teriyaki - I honestly enjoy this more than teriyaki at any japanese restaurant I've been to  and I'm not ashamed to admit thatChicken Parmesan - See comment above  swap japanese for italian. The marinara is actually seasoned (and a little spicy)  which I love. Balsamic Glazed Chicken - The chicken is always cooked perfectly  and the fried onion strings adds a great crunch
Simarprit S.,San Jose  CA,4,57,11,11/12/2014,3.0,If they keep themselves at 3/5  they would remain in business. Problem with 3/5 is that they would always be vulnerable to a new restaurant opening up and walking away with their business.We were a party of four and we had Tortilla Soup Bowl. It was good  mae us ready for main meal. Southern Fried Chicken was beautifully curated and enjoyable. Parmesan Chicken was Paremasn ChickenSalmon Dinner was good but portions were way too small.Pizzokie trio was fantastic dish and was thoroughly enjoyable as a dish. Cookies and ice cream were very fresh.
Scott S.,Elk Grove  CA,147,197,215,6/19/2013,1.0,Normally it pains me to write a one star review  but not today.  We came here for a family gathering.  We arrived about 1150 am and were told it would be about a 25-30 minute wait. We were very patient and continued to wait for about 45 minutes. We were finally seated and given our menus. Our waiter was friendly enough  but a bit slow. It took a few minutes to get our drinks and even longer to get our apps. We received our main courses. My fiancee had ordered a sandwich and asked for no bacob. It ended up coming with extra bacon and when we pointed this out the waiter simply took the order back and removed the bacon. We demanded that a new sandwich be made and had it about 10 minutes later.They ended up comping a desert and actually screwed that up as well.Too bad because I normally like the beer here.
Catherine B.,Fremont  CA,302,147,64,3/20/2015,2.0,Yeah this place is a straight up no for me. Because of all the construction going on so close by (construction for what? They've had it going on for like four years...) they had to like re-arrange the parking lot completely. So now a giant  empty lot has been reduced to a few parking space up front then the rest cut off in an awkward loop further away from the restaurant. It's really inconvenient&weird.My family&I came when the place wasn't really busy but we still had to wait (even though there were empty tables everywhere). I was torn between the Atlantic Salmon&the Angel Hair Classico. I chose the Angel Hair. I regret everything.The sauce was literally water. It was like they forgot to take the noodles out of the water that they cooked them in then threw some cheese&vegetables on top in an effort to make it better. It just made it worse. It was probably the worst pasta I've ever ordered. The noodles weren't even angel hair - they were thin  tiny  &not even long. It was like someone cut the noodles into quarters then put it back in the soup water. It was gross. This really ruined my last experience with BJ's (which wasn't that bad) &I don't even think it's worth coming back here just for a pizookie.
Kimberly C.,Austin  TX,92,337,81,2/18/2014,3.0,Went to this location once. Service  must be because it wasn't packed  was attentive. Balsamic chicken was overcooked and the salad was wilted (from the heat of the hot plate and/or chocken) which is my ultimate pet peeve! Dry  overgrilled chicken breast was edible at least. The buttery mashed potatoes and fried onion strings were decent. Gave a three star review because the fiance stated his burger was good. And of course their shoe string fries are tasty as always at each BJs location.
Leizel B.,San Jose  CA,383,142,261,10/17/2014,3.0,I came here last night with a friend for dinner. Like all BJs it was crowded and noisy. On top of that  the Giants game was on so it was even more crazy. (We didn't think about that before we decided to come here...our fault). The wait for a table wasn't too long  we waited about 20 minutes. Once we were seated  we were asked immediately what we wanted to drink  of course we say just waters for now because we haven't even gotten a chance to look at the menu. After a few minutes  we finally place our orders. I ordered the rib eye  medium rare  with a wedge salad and baked potato. For my drink I got their strawberry patch. My friend ordered the jambalaya. My steak was cooked perfectly  however  the seasoning was bland or nonexistent. I had to add my own salt and douse it in A-1 sauce and horseradish. My friend enjoyed her jambalaya. The portion they gave her was huge and she was only able to eat half of it. My drink tasted just like strawberries  but the alcohol content seemed very low  kind of tasted like I was just drinking a strawberry lemonade. I don't like my drinks super strong  but I'm paying for an alcoholic drink  it should make me feel kind of warm and fuzzy.Now  on to dessert... if I could give the rating on just the Pazookies alone  I would give it 5 stars. I mean you cannot go wrong with fresh baked cookies topped with ice cream. Can you? We ordered the trio with chocolate chunk  double chocolate  and macadamia nut cookies. OH SO GOOD!! I should've ordered a glass of milk with it  but I was too full. Our service was just ok. The server was very nice  however he was a little slow and when we needed him he was nowhere to be found.
Monica M.,San Jose  CA,109,55,41,1/19/2014,4.0,The theme o the night was to try something new - and so my fianc and I happened upon this place. The lighting was nice and dim  the menu had a little bit of everything- pizza  burgers  BBQ  pastas  salads  sandwiches  soups  wraps  chicken dinners. I got the balsamic chicken and it was Devine! The chicken was tender and moist   the cheese mashed potatoes were on point. The service was well attentive. The drink selection was out of this world with so many options! - and don't get me started with the pizza/cookie dessert  it was yummy yummy yummy. I recommend this place for those who want to expand their beer tasting palates or if your looking for a relaxed place to have a date.Only down side was that the Caesar salad was a bit bland with barely any dressing.- the place had a security guard monitoring the parking lot which was a nice touch since the restaurant is located in this empty shopping center with construction going on.
Jim F.,Muskego  WI,1,92,,11/9/2014,3.0,Had dinner Friday. Got there around 6:00PM and already really crowded. But I got one of the two tables left in the bar area. Within minutes  standing room only. Service was prompt and efficient all the way through my time there.  Especially considering how busy it was. Food was just OK. I had a rack of ribs with a Caesar salad and roasted asparagus. The ribs were pretty good. But the salad was just a bunch of lettuce in a bowl with bottled dressing on it. Asparagus was just put under a broiler until charred. No seasoning of any kind. Neither side was bad. Just nothing special. Almost an afterthought to the meal. A bit expensive for the entree to have that. The beer was really good. I had their in house pale ale on tap. Yummy. Probably won't go out of my way to go there again but will not avoid it either. Thus 3 stars.
Tiffany T.,Eugene  OR,119,341,538,8/30/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,My favorites are their gourmet mac and cheese  grilled burger melt  cajun pasta  grilled chicken alfredo  atlantic salmon  and jambalaya.Also love their strawberry splash! Seriously  I couldn't taste any alcohol in it. It just tastes like a slushie.
Kristoffer C.,Union City  CA,39,67,63,3/2/2015,2.0,Went to BJ Brewery late night dinner  after coming from a trip from LA. Decided to go a little healthy and ate some salmon and rice pilaf. It was really good  but until i got the price thats the thing that i didnt like. But on top of that  I stepped out to use the restroom  and as I was walking in to the bathroom  there was throw up everywhere on the floor and on the ground. Alerted them right away  but they didnt clean it up for a bit. So I had to wait till i got home to use the restroom
Ricardo G.,San Jose  CA,0,6,5,3/25/2016,2.0,Waiter was excellent  food on the other hand seemed to be sitting under the heating for a while. When I received my meal  my deep dish ravioli was Luke warm. disappointed
Jake D.,San Leandro  CA,113,5,,5/12/2015,1.0,Angry review is angry...Immediately seated  (called ahead)... Flagged a server down after waiting twenty minutes. Gave her our cocktail and food order. Server seemed  well  let's call it dazed and confused. Fifteen minutes after giving our orders  no cocktails  no water  nada.We were walking out  the manager stopped us to try to smooth things out. Another patron came up  they had been there for two and a half hours  took them an hour to even get their appetizers...All in all  I give the place two middle fingers. They are not going to survive like that when the new restaurants open at the mall.
Lisa S.,Fremont  CA,187,349,732,12/16/2014,4.0,I rarely ever go to BJ's just because of the fact that every location makes me wait so long for decent food. They do have a good selection of their pizzas which they are know for but I usually stick to the appetizers and salad.
Mary T.,Newark  CA,15,2,2,6/29/2015,4.0,"My choice for dinner brought us to BJ\'s in Newark  Ca. I wanted to change things up and didn\'t want my usual drink. Our kind waitress Jessica Watson (last name because we found out their are about 4 Jessica\'s that work there.) recommended a drink called ""drink like that"" it was so tasty that I was drinking it to fast the alcohol caught up to me later. That was fine because the food was good. And you can\'t end the evening with out getting dessert. We ordered the trio of pazookies. We chose chocolate chip  triple chocolate & my favorite peanut butter but with a twist they were trying something new. They placed Jam in top of the cookie so it tasted like a PB & J sandwich. Thanks Jessica"
Dani S.,Fremont  CA,207,14,3,12/13/2015,2.0,"Dined here multiple times for the past few years. I\'m only giving this place 2 stars because I feel like it has SO much potential to be an amazing restaurant and bar but managment had dropped the ball. The service here is always really slow and it takes a good 40 minutes just to get your appetizers  to find it cold and not even worth eating. The food is okay but I can say 9 out of 10 times something is wrong with it. And don\'t get me wrong I\'m not the type to be picky when ordering or asking for ""everything on the side"" but it\'s usually that one thing you don\'t ask for will be on your plate. For example my birthday a couple years back a ordered a pasta with no meat. My plate finally comes out and not only did I find a peace of sausage in my pasta I also found a peace of plastic. The manager was generous enough to have my tables meal be comp\'d. But seriously?! C\'mon BJ\'s step it up!"
Kayla F.,Eugene  OR,286,36,33,12/28/2015,3.0,Bj's has a great variety of food. When my best friend and I went it was a bit crowded. The service was slow but it seemed to be slow because of the lack of staff members. I ordered a bison burger that was really undercooked and usually I like meat rare but this was a bit bloody. My friend ordered a salmon over rice and beans that looked super healthy and made to perfection.
Helen N.,Milpitas  CA,115,39,46,9/27/2013,2.0,I don't know if my boyfriend and I have bad luck or not but the service here is always terrible! We never have any utensils on our table and when I try to flag down an employee for some.. it would take forever for them to actually give me them. Our food always comes late  my boyfriend would have to eat while I eat or vice versa. I love their food  I really do  especially their famous pizookie but sometimes it's just not worth to drive all the way here because of the bad service.
Ryan T.,Lincoln  CA,275,204,34,12/8/2013,4.0,Been to this place a few times now  and havent been disappointed yet. The only thing that really sucks is the wait.. but i guess all good things are worth waiting for  right?They have amazing house brewed beers in all varieties. It definitely seems like the servers have a good understanding of what they are serving too. They make recommendations and really know their stuff.The food is pretty good. Not top notch  but its pretty good. They have such a huge variety of choices on the menu  it makes it really hard to decide. The real treat comes at desert... the pizookie. Wow... so many choices on how you can have it  and all the ones ive tried are amazing!
Dani K.,Brentwood  CA,23,10,2,4/26/2015,2.0,Plates smelled like egg. Food was good. Service was okay. Asked for plates and never got them.
Min L.,Fremont  CA,0,21,5,11/19/2015,2.0,11/19 Thursday night. First time in this BJ  not impressed. Sanding front of the host ( Sandra ) for 5 minutes. She never acknowledged  greeting  or even looked at us. She wasn't rude  but just looked very confused and stressed.
Tara L.,Caulstown  Republic of Ireland,37,28,2,3/15/2016,4.0,My friends and I ordered to go. We got pizza  stuffed mushrooms  lettuce wraps and dessert  the baked beignet. Food was soooo good. Packaged perfectly  not soggy. Food had perfect tempature.
Samantha C.,Bay Area,119,435,509,5/13/2011,1.0,The food is below par and the service is complete crap. Each and every time I have been to this place  I leave annoyed. If I could give zero stars  I definitely would. The only reasons as to why I have been here in the past is because it is close to home and at a convenient location. The very first time I went here  the service was unbelievably bad. Our waitress continuously got our orders wrong and she even wrongfully brought our condiments to another table. We ordered a pizza without sun-dried tomatoes and when we got it she actually omitted all tomatoes  fresh and sun-dried. She barely apologized nor were we compensated for their mistake. Another time I went  I ordered a bake potato and my boyfriend ordered a sandwich. We waited for 30+ minutes when our server finally decides to come to tell us that something went wrong with their potatoes so they had to throw everything away and start the cooking process over. As soon as he finished talking  he walked away. He did not ask if I wanted to order something different nor did he offer to bring out my boyfriend's sandwich first. The waiter never apologized nor did the manager. Ten minutes later  our food came and it was mediocre.  The food is honestly not amazing for the prices that they charge and the service is impeccably poor. People dine out for the experience and of course the food too  but this place has neither to offer. I would rather drive further and go to The Cheesecake Factory instead  where the food is good and where my business is appreciated.
Daniel H.,Hayward  CA,88,40,39,8/28/2014,2.0,So I haven't been to BJ's in a while because I'm trying not to pay a bunch of money for awesome irresistible desserts all the time (*cough* PIZZOOKIE!!! *cough*). But they got me: free Pizzookie if you download the app and order on the app!!! I don't know if I've ever downloaded an app faster...So I committed the great sin of deliciousness  and headed straight over. When I went to check in at the restaurant  I swear the hostess saw me  thought of greeting me  then decided against it. The manager had to nudge her  then she finally greeted me and got me seated. I told her about my order that had already been placed  and she told me my server would be out shortly. Okay... So I waited forEVER for a server to bring me WaTer and verify my order. They took a long time AGAIN to finally bring me my Pizzookie. The Pizzookie wasn't amazing  but it met my expectations at least - slightly over cooked but otherwise still a big cookie with ice cream. :)The best part? When I told the manager how bad the service was he did not care AT ALL!!! Don't worry  man  I won't be back to get any more of that service.1 star for the service  1 added for a free Pizzookie that was slightly overcooked. No return trips intended.
Kelly H.,Grand Blanc  MI,1,24,28,11/13/2014,5.0,I've eaten here about 5 times in the last 3 weeks. I'm impressed by the extensive menu a since I'm staying at a nearby hotel. They have consistently good quality. Tonight  April was my waitress. She only works Thursday and Friday; but so far she has been the best! I've eaten Mahi tacos twice  Ahi Poke twice  avocado egg rolls  and a salad. All were good quality and fresh. Hefeweizen was good - better than Claim Jumpers by far. Close to Hacker Schorr. One night we had bad service in a group of 6  but the manager was quick to recover.  I'll be back again. Ahi poke was the best!
Stacy V.,Patterson  CA,28,16,46,2/24/2014,4.0,We took our 8 year old son to this place for his birthday because he wanted to order the ribs. We told the waitress that it was his birthday! Thinking he will get something...a small cupcake  or some ice cream... Or something.... We waited.... And..... Nope! Nothing! I haven't been to a restaurant where they don't do anything! I mean for the price you pay for the food  you would expect something.  The food was great here! Loved every bite. So we ordered buffalo wings and they only give a few wings for $9.50. Ya I think that's a little over priced. Anyway overall the wait staff was good and so was the food.
Rita K.,Union City  CA,611,586,289,5/15/2013,3.0,A solid 3 stars. There may be a wait during dinner time  especially on weekends  so I recommend making reservations ahead of time. The food here is okay  but the pizzas are really good  especially the buffalo chicken one! I recommend coming here during HH after work (I think it ends at 6pm) for half off mini pizzas! Their HH specials for drinks aren't that much of a discount  $1 off drinks for the most part. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've been here a bunch of times over the past few years and I never had a problem with their food. I recommend buffalo chicken pizza  cobb salad  and their wings. The 5 pepper wings (extra hot) isn't that spicy at all  so all you spicy lover freaks would be able to eat it with no sweat. The pizookie is what BJ's is known for. Delicious melted cookie with ice cream on top dessert... mmmm. Might come here for my birthday for the free pizookie. We watched a Warriors playoff game here once near the bar  we had to call in advance to reserve one of the tall table with stools and got a great view of the big TV screen. I recommend coming here for sports games! Lots of screens everywhere with volume.
Sarah L.,Flushing  NY,19,149,140,1/6/2014,3.0,My little cousin was raving about this place so we took him. Reminds me of Cheesecake Factory...don't know if that's good or bad.Highlight = Pizookie
Lynn D.,Fremont  CA,221,4,,8/4/2016,4.0,I love this place  the staffs here are so nice and friendly. The food are great w very reasonable price. Would definitely recommanded friends and family
Sahil D.,San Leandro  CA,19,15,1,2/28/2015,2.0,"So we were at this Place on a Tuesday night. I started to experience their bad service in first 10 mins. The waiter said she would be back to take our order in 2 mins and she din show up for 15mins. Some other waiter asked us if we want something (without even a smile on her face). We ordered and after 5 mins the first waitress  shows up and puts plates on our table WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT US  then the pasta was bad (tasted like they warmed up frozen pasta) and garlic bread was cold. Upon telling the waitress that the bread is cold she said ""I can microwave it for you"" b*tch I don\'t come here to eat microwaved food.BAD FOOD  BAD SERVICE!!!!"
Smash S.,Fremont  CA,6,53,121,7/23/2014,1.0,Always bad service  always a long wait for food.We've now been waiting 40 minutes for 2 pizookies & 2 small pizzas........I've only had good service from nico & amanda.You're better off ordering to go  but their food isn't all that anyways so you should probably just cook at home.
Ann H.,San Francisco  CA,0,41,5,1/15/2016,3.0,The place is clean and the food is good. I love the ribs here! However  there were a few instances when I ordered off the lunch menu and was charged the dinner price. When we asked the server about this  she didn't make any effort to resolve the issue. I let it go since the dish was already consumed. If she knew the item was on the lunch and dinner menu  she should ask which one we wanted. This happened again when ordering to-go. I was charged the dinner price ordering off the lunch menu. Although I enjoyed my meal  I realize I have to be diligent so I don't get charged extra.
Mindy R.,Newark  CA,0,1,,2/26/2017,1.0,I would give this place 0 stars if that was an option. Being there are limited places in the area to accommodate a large party of people we didn't have much choice but to eat here. I blame the management for the problems we had. They had a weeks notice about our party of 30 and clearly did not prepare. After being seated one waiter took our drink and appetizer order and then I guess he left so after a half hour we finally tracked a server down who took drink orders again and then promptly forgot what we ordered. The manager was clearly overwhelmed and did not have a handle on the restaurant. After the waiter brought half of the drinks we ordered and forgot what the order was that he took 15 minutes before he then proceeded to argue with our table that he didn't take that order the other guy did and he just got here. We reminded him that we just gave the order to him. I don't know if he was high or had a learning disability but he was not all there. When the dinner order was finally taken needless to say we were a little nervous and with good reason  as the dishes started coming out things were not what we ordered and there was more confusion. To top it off the man paying for the dinner did not get his food. After the third time of being told it was coming the waiter finally admitted it was given to somebody else.. wtf. There was no offer of compensation for the bill which when finally tallied was 1 296 a good gesture of the manager would have been to take 10-20% off the bill. The bathrooms were disgusting no toilet paper in the stalls and again excuses from the staff 'the hostess is supposed to take care of this  there is supposed to five of them' PATHETIC is the best way to describe the restaurant and the staff we had people from all over the world and it is a shame that i as one of the American's in the group was extremely embarrassed by the quality of service and treament we rececived.
William M.,Irvine  CA,65,420,1704,11/9/2013,2.0,The problem with this BJ's location is that they don't have any close-by competition to keep them on their toes  such as Yard House  Cheesecake Factory  etc.As a result  the gaggle of self-chatty hostesses hand you a pager with a 15 minute wait  direct you into the bar area  where there's a full menu but not enough wait staff to give prompt service. Why not just have a wait list for everyone? We may have been better off just waiting the 15 minutes for a regular table.The food is likely to be BJ's the usual good BJ's selections  but unfortunately it's not here yet...waiting...waiting...
Jo L.,San Jose  CA,22,218,24,9/8/2014,2.0,Had the BBQ chicken pizza and hooooly crap it was sooo salty! Imagine a delicious looking BBQ pizza  you could probs find a pic here and now imagine a mound of salt on top. Not just as a garnish. Nope  just obnoxiously sitting on top of your pizza ruining every bite. If it weren't for being a bit buzzed from a pitcher of their Berry cider  I would've cried a river of SALTY AF tears.
Eric H.,Salinas  CA,49,69,22,6/17/2014,1.0,We get our table at 5:30pm. Our entire group had arrived(11 people total)and ordered at 6:10pm. There was no one checking on us or offering water ( many of us were out for some time) and we complained to the suppose manger at around 6:55pm for at least water. Some of us got their appetizer but no plates at around 7pm. Then finally some of us start receiving our food at around 7:25pm.... REALLY!!!!! There was even 2 orders that were wrong or forgotten. This was on a Tuesday evening  isn't this suppose to be a easier day of the week for a restaurant? The one star doesn't express the frustration and hunger we had. I don't know what was happening in the back but the server could of attended to us a bit more  could of even improved our impression at BJ's. We tried to have their dessert  which we heard was good  but they are still messing up. 2 more orders were taken incorrectly or done wrong and it's 8:16pm....After everything we were given a discount but it still no excuses for this to happen to anyone. If what we heard was true  the girl who served us was very knew  which would explain why she couldn't seem to handle everything that was going on. She shouldn't have been given such a large group or have some one help her out. I feel bad for her but not for the business  this could of been avoided with better training and leadership....
Bridgett W.,Seattle  WA,387,240,302,11/9/2014,5.0,We love BJ's. Always great service and this location did well to keep it up. We were seated right away  got delicious food from a friendly server  and enjoyed the dark  chilled out atmosphere. We were happy they were open late on a weeknight too because we had postponed our dinner until after we went to the nearby mall.
Vira P.,San Francisco  CA,334,1139,1130,4/5/2013,3.0,I got the mahi-mahi off their lower-calorie menu. I guess lower calories mean less portions. It was small compared to the rest of the menu. But it was pretty good so I can't complain too much.As always  I ordered the avocado egg rolls to start. The egg rolls were good  but the tamarind sauce was watery  as if they're trying to make their inventory last longer.The highlight  of course  is the pizookie. Can't go wrong with a pizookie.Service was fast and friendly. So basically it's just your average BJ's Restaurant.
Ryan D.,San Leandro  CA,150,377,16,12/31/2012,2.0,"Newbie. But I\'m not missing out. Your hard-earned nine bucks will give you ten small boneless ""wings.""I think that\'s a little too overpriced. Unless it came with an actual BJ. Catch up with a friend over a pazookie here. That\'s all I recommend."
Jared T.,Sunnyvale  CA,14,12,,10/15/2015,1.0,I don't expect a world class meal when I order lunch from a place like this  but I do expect something to taste better than what my 3 year old made me for breakfast this morning. A coworker and I ordered the shrimp scampi to go. When we got back to work to eat it (a 2 minute drive) we realized that the pasta had absolutely no flavor. There was no salt used when cooking  It seemed as if there was no sauce on the noodles  and when i dipped my finger into the small amount of sauce on the bottom to see if maybe it wasn't sticking to the noodles  I found that it was nothing but starchy water with a little oil. The shrimp had the same quality you get from a bag of frozen shrimp from Safeway for 8.99. I understand this isn't Forbes Mill and I don't hold them to this standard  but when I spend 18.00 dollars on a single lunch I expect to take more than one bite before I throw it in the garbage.
Eva H.,San Ramon  CA,53,217,10,9/27/2014,2.0,Why do my in-laws insist on going here. I can't stand this place but I wasn't part of the decision for dinner. The service was good so nothing against our server. The food however  ugh  just eat before you go - How do you screw up a Mango salad? Answer: you make the chicken dry and you don't use ripe mangos and you don't put any dressing on it. Who makes the worst salad ever? Answer: BJ's  that's who.
Randy R.,Charlotte  NC,0,7,36,2/11/2016,4.0,Good Food  pricey drinks. Great service and local beers. Busy on Thursday Night before the Super Bowl off the beaten path in Newark CA.
Drew C.,Santa Clara  CA,1,11,,1/23/2016,3.0,Decent place to grab a few beers  watch a sports game  and have some food. It won't blow you away  but just consistently solid.
Mike P.,Newark  CA,0,3,,7/24/2016,2.0,We visited this place last night. The service was horrible  it took them 20 minutes just to take our order. They didn't bring any silverware. Received my appetizer. Had to wait before they brought some out by that time it was cold. The waiter was nice but she had way too many tables. The food was good hence the 2 stars. Advice to restaurant please hire more staff to meet the demands of of your customers.
Susan M.,Hayward  CA,4,10,10,2/17/2016,2.0,Long wait time. Rude waiters and below average food. Only good thing about is its pretty clean and they good selection of beers
Cynthia B.,Fremont  CA,234,159,69,11/13/2014,4.0,I actually really enjoy the pizza here  and it's one of my go to places for when I'm craving some deep dished or hand tossed pizza. My boyfriend and I especially love the chicken with white sauce. So much flavor and deliciousness! We usually come here and have to wait but the wait never seems long for me because we are either playing charades with my family. Or if we are alone  we'll have plenty to talk about to let the time pass. The service is also pretty good  they've always been really nice and polite to me. On one rare occasion  they did keep forgetting to give us cheese and hot peppers for the pizza after we asked multiple times. But I'll let that go since the food is good! Overall  it's a huge restaurant with good pizza and good service  definitely a good go to chain place.
Kathy L.,Fremont  CA,3,14,1,6/19/2014,1.0,"So unhappy with this Newark restaurant. The quality of their food has dropped so far in the last year. Not sure what has happened but the end result is awful. For the prices they charge  I expect to rave about everything I eat. We used Grub Hub to order online and get the food delivered. Big mistake. Took over an hour to get a pizza and 2 sides delivered. Food was lukewarm and tasteless. We ordered a ""create your own"" hand tossed pizza. 25 bucks later we got a pizza with almost no toppings  no extra cheese that I ordered and the skimping on the toppings that did make it onto the pizza was offensive. The first time I went to BJs I loved it. That was back in early 2013. In 18 months I don\'t know what happened but nothing I\'ve eaten at this restaurant since then has been worth my patronage. Be warned!!!"
Daniel D.,Hayward  CA,6,12,6,4/3/2015,5.0,There was a 30min wait for a table  but it was made all better when they brought pizza to us in the waiting area.When I come here  it's for the Chile Verde Fries (appetizer) & a pizookie  but they're always good.
Jack K.,Irvine  CA,10,5,2,8/16/2015,1.0,Worst service I have ever experienced. We ordered online ahead at 635 to be seated by 7 got seated by 715 and didn't get our food until 745-750 and when the food got to us it was cold. The medium rare burger I got turned into a well done and our appetizer hasn't come. It still hasn't as I am typing this review at 8:10pm. DO NOT COME HERE. Terrible terrible service
Megan D.,Davis  CA,124,24,7,1/2/2016,2.0,When the food comes out on time and together  it ends up quite good. However the service is often awful  with orders cold  late or forgotten. But  a fine selection of beers.
Amy L.,Santa Clara  CA,400,747,273,6/14/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"Sorry  gotta bump it down to three stars. Came with the boy + some friends for my friend\'s graduation. We called ahead of time [45 minutes] to reserve a table for 10  but they said reservations were booked  although they don\'t take reservations much earlier. The boy and I rushed over after congratulating our friend.Luckily  they had a no-show  so they had a table for us. We only had to wait for about 30 minutes  which was how long it took for our friend&the rest of the party to show  anyway. The staff was super nice about our friends taking awhile to come. It got reallyyy busy about 10-15 minutes after the boy&I got there  which was understandable [graduation season].Anyway  our waiter was pretty nice and brought out waters for everybody promptly. Took us awhile to decide what to order  but we had fun waiting for the food. However  the food definitely took longer that I thought it would to prepare. Appetizers were decent [pesto chicken flat bread  tortilla chips with artichoke dip  potato skins]. The boy&I ended up splitting a medium Great White deep dish pizza. Price was alright  and the pizza was definitely more than enough for us [we had 3 slices left to take home]. I was so disappointed in it  though. Compared to the legit Chicago Pizza that I\'ve had since I last was here  it was.... mediocre. The crust was soggy  the flavor was bland [I needed ranch! On an Alfredo-based pizza. What the heck!]  and it was just... okay. Pizookie was still delicious  but gotta bump them down a star for mediocre food. Oh  and there\'s nothing really brewed at this ""brewhouse."" They say that cherry coke&root beer are ""brewed"" here  but last time I checked  neither of those require fermentation  so it doesn\'t really count. False Advertisement! :POh well."
Nazz A.,Santa Clara  CA,0,13,4,8/15/2015,2.0,Waited 15 min for a server. Turns out the server in our section went on break so no one was assigned to help us. Wtf. Ordered a very berry margarita. Ive had it numeorus times. Usually delicious. This one was terrible. Too strong. Every sip burned my throat lie i was taking a shot. My bbq brisket burger was dry. Not enough sauce. They forgot the ranch i ordered. Had to ask again.
Cath M.,San Francisco  CA,314,1076,1066,9/11/2010,4.0,"I asked the girlfriend where she wanted to eat... she said: I want beer.OK.I suggested this spot since it\'s along the way home... and I\'ve been craving their ""sweet pig"" so we got here around 4ish... apparently that\'s still their Happy Hour in the bar area... we didn\'t know that until we saw the bill! Awesome!We ordered the following:- Garlic Parmesan Kettle-Style Chips = it was my first time tasting it and I\'m a BIG fan! It was delicious! So crispy and it very addictive! Girlfriend and I couldn\'t stop munching on it! I\'ll definitely get this next time around!- Mini sweet pig = it hit the spot! I inhaled this sucker in no time! Tasty and overloaded with toppings!- Mini southwestern for the girlfriend and she inhaled it as well (she just ran a 10K so it was no biggie for her!) - BJ\'s Famous Pizookie = never really had this but since she was uber excited about this... we had to get it. This a deadly dessert. After eating it  I\'m trying to schedule in my head the days I\'m hitting the gym and the rides that I\'ll do! Yah  talk about guilt trip!Our server was here and there... she forgot my drink so my friend was annoyed but it was ok to me. Its another hit or miss spot.When we got the bill... my friend and I were shocked. Damn... we grubbed and it was just $27! Yup... with the food and dessert and my friend\'s beer... we rocked it!PS: they don\'t serve Hanger One so ... eh for the bar part!? =)"
Dyutika P.,Fremont  CA,20,20,,7/30/2014,2.0,Stick to their beers  the cocktails are too sweet and fruity.The service is too slow and lethargic
Jana L.,San Francisco  CA,201,360,629,2/2/2013,4.0,I'm a fan for their constantly good American Food! Their appetizers are really yummy! I've tried chicken wings  calamari  and the spinach & artichoke dip here. All were pretty consistent! I love calamari  so eating this was really satisfying.I usually get the porkchops here or the sandwiches. The lunch specials have good soup/salad/sandwich combos! They're priced REALLY well too! :)  I like the porkchops for dinner because they provide a variety of things to munch on. You get potatoes  meat  and vegetables! Deep dish pizza is also really good here too but I'm picky with the toppings so I usually just don't end up getting it.AND LASTLY... the pizzookies are like absolute BEAUTIES. It's literally ice cream on top of a cookie but why the hell is it SO DAMN GOOD. I get the macademia nut all the time!!!! But the best combo is the macademia nut + oreo half and half. OMG. Like  pure deliciousness. Because I mean  you need some chocolate in your pizzookie! I've also had the raspberry white chocolate one  and that one was also really good. Ughhhhh  I want a pizzookie just talking about this! Om nom noms. The food is good. Go.
K K.,Fremont  CA,15,22,2,2/3/2016,1.0,This is one of the worst places I have been to  the service is terrible. We went one night with party of eight and they made us wait for two hours. The manager indicated that they accidentally took our name from list but did not offer an apology.  The service was terrible and I would never go here again.
Arnab R.,Fremont  CA,0,41,,8/15/2015,2.0,Average food with very bad service. Waitress was very good and responsive  but the server just dumped the food  literally  on the table  all the time. And this is the first time ever I have to write about smaller portion size in any restaurant! Calamari fries came halfway full in the plate! I was wondering maybe something went wrong  but then noticed same orders for other tables  and they were all half full. Either increase the portion to full plate  or serve the same portion in a smaller plate  but don't keep it half full. Its a big time put off from customer perception point of view.And nobody came back to check on us to see if we want another round of beverages.
Yelp'y Yelper T.,Fremont  CA,1,78,96,5/23/2014,3.0,"TGIF: Beer times are good times :-). Always packed with sparsely open seating which is good  can find a spot even when busy. Service is typically really good as the servers are cool and quick at what they do. Food always taste good but has \'upset\' some bellies a time or two. In one instance in March 2014  all the people at our table enjoyed the meal but got violently sick through the evening and into the next day. Because the meal impacted all of us we contacted the location and the managers comments were basically ""well  it happens  nothing I can do about it""  no apology or offers to make it up were given. It didnt seem like he cared at all that our ENTIRE table got sick  kinda seemed like a normal occurrence for him. Three calls (and messages) to corporate went unanswered  seemed like no one cared about us all getting food poisoning. Regardless  we keep going back for cold beers and good times  but are WAY MORE selective of the things we order  mainly Avocado egg rolls and flat pizza apps.My main gripe is that they call themselves a ""Brewhouse"" and the don\'t brew beer at all. Every drop is private labeled brewed for them by Saint Arnold brewery in Texas. Having mock serving tanks in every location is totally unethical  borderline fraud. They deserve 2 stars but will be nice today and give them 3 because we enjoy the ambiance and meeting our friends there. Plus they are better (and slightly safer) than Jacks Brewery across town."
Justin C.,San Leandro  CA,373,771,899,6/27/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,After another visit  I have to say that BJ's stepped up their game. A lot better beer on tap and pretty tasty food. I had the Angus Pot Roast Sandwich. It has to be eaten with a knife and fork. Quite large wouldn't do this thing justice. It was huge  and tasty to boot.The Pizookie was rich and decadent. I could only muster up enough courage to take a couple of bites.I think I'll return.
Tiffany Michelle L.,Fremont  CA,299,243,470,7/12/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,The new Bison burger was okay - kinda plain  I suggest they try a new or better sauceI'm not sure if the coleslaw was supposed to be dry with no liquid or not  but that is the way it came.
Zita Marie F.,East Palo Alto  CA,1,9,8,1/7/2015,3.0,The food was amazing! The salmon dish was also good and I was satisfied even tho it don't scream my name when I received it but it was yummy! The baked lasagna dish was fantastic! First time going had a good server and enjoyed it the second time it was not so good the server didn't have great customer service possibly could of been having a bad day. I didn't feel so welcomed even though he looked like he was trying his best. But my family enjoyed the food so it didn't turn out to be a completely a bad time.
Michael V.,San Jose  CA,59,80,,5/21/2014,5.0,I came here this past Sunday night with a friend and just walked right in and sat in a booth in the open bar area.There were a couple napkins on the table  so i guess it looked like we had been there for a while.We didn't get helped for a couple minutes. The waitress came by and super apologized because she just took over someone's shift and I guess we sat down at the exact time she took over.She was really considerate and went above and beyond what she needed to do as far as recognizing the situation and then blending it into the rest of our stay.Very professional. Oh  the alcoholic root beer tastes way better in my head. Next time I'll just get a normal root beer.  has no sweg.
Amy C.,Newark  CA,1488,975,1694,11/30/2010,4.0,Loved the avacado egg rolls = yum!Pizooki = yummie too!Pretty elegant decor.So far I've tried this location & the San Bruno one.About the same. And I had this pear or berry cider at the San Bruno one which was delicious! I forgot what's it called though.
E L.,San Francisco  CA,58,52,4,3/15/2014,2.0,"I am currently at the restaurant right now and our visit is not pleasant. I called ahead to my name down and advise the hostess that I will be coming in 15 minutes. We arrived at BJ\'s and walked right in. There were two young ladies at the front. Neither of them acknowledge me and I had to initiate the conversation that I was present. I told then that I wanted to check-in because I called ahead of time. Forty minutes and our pager buzzed and we were seated. We then waited for fifteen minutes with no one either acknowledge ""We will be with you shortly or something along the lines of we\'re busy right now and we will take your order shortly."" I don\'t expect this type of service from a known and high-end restaurant. I am not sure if they lack training or their employees are not happy with thier job. I don\'t want to put any names down so they can put training across the board. Service = 1Food = 3Waiting = 2Environment = 3Overall = 2"
Moe F.,Fremont  CA,5,11,4,8/2/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,"This is one of the best BJs Restaurant I have been too although I visited many different locations in California but this location is the BEST. They provide Excellent Service. As soon as I walk up to the Bar Area  Lawrence  Anthony  Loriane and Lance will have my drinks (H2O) ready and they even know how I like my appetizer\'s prepared. Last week I lost my Gold Premier Rewards Member\'s Card. I sent an email thru main corporate website and requested a replacement card. Few days later I revisited the same restaurant for dinner  while I was having dinner the Restaurant General Manager Mr. Evan Crisp walked up to me and greeted me by my name ""Moe"" which got me surprised and handed me a replacement GOLD PREMIER REWARDS Card without me asking for it. I was expecting a replacement card in the mail from the main corporate office. I was very impressed by the General Manager Mr. Evan Crisp. Not to mention that they have excellent food and beverage selections. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. Oh! yes  During the NFL (Football) NBA (Basket Ball) & MLB (Baseball) season this is the BEST SPORTS BAR to hang out with friends and family."
Lauren L.,Long Beach  CA,24,12,,3/8/2014,1.0,I love Bjs food  so this is specifically for my service. I myself being a server can understand when you're slammed or forget to grab something  but this guy checked on us once if you don't count him asking about the check (initials K.G). Our drinks when unfilled for a half hour  no exaggeration. My friend waited a good 15 minutes refusing to eat his pizza because he needed ranch. I had to flag down another server. I feel like to get a good tip  you just got check on me after I get my food  mid way  and towards the end. It's free refills  so keep my water coming. No tip for you.
Edwin N.,Fremont  CA,42,207,15,9/6/2014,4.0,This has got to be one of the better chain restaurants out there. The food is good and the service even better. I've been to this location a few times and my experience has always been positive.The last time I was here I took my daughter out for lunch...we had pizza and beer and we both got carded! I thought this was hilarious cause I'm an old fart.Pizza was good  but not spectacular and the beer was also good. We had their house porter beer cause my daughter wanted to try it. I wanted something a little hoppier to pair with the pizza  but I went along with my girls choice.The staff was outstanding attending to our needs and several of the staff kept checking on us making sure everything was okay.All in all not bad food and excellent service.
Raj P.,Hayward  CA,57,12,2,4/1/2014,2.0,Thought to try them again as was not too happy with them the first time around. First disappointment - the Cajun Pasta - most blend pasta I ever had anywhere. No spice at all. Tasted like it was just dipped in light tomato sauce.Second disappointment - ordered appetizers during happy hour and it was good but when we ordered more  we were told it would cost more since it was no longer happy hour. No problem with that. What was disappointing was when we were told that the portion would also be bigger because it was at regular price. Been to a lot of places during happy hour and always price was cheaper during happy hour but the portion was always the same. So happy hour price is not a big savings at BJ's since they also short you on the portion. Very disappointed in that little trick. Why not just remove the appetizers from happy hour since it's really a bait and switch.
Nancy H.,Fremont  CA,1,10,5,2/25/2015,1.0,Came in with a Deaf group of people. Manager refused to turn on Captioning on their TV so we could follow the game. Won't be coming back. Shame really because its a great hang out and good food.  Manager needs to learn American Disability Act because someone gonna sued them for not accomadating DEAF FOLKS. Fremont especially where the State Deaf School is.. tons of deaf folks. tisk tisk
Maria M.,Union City  CA,23,48,47,10/26/2015,4.0,I had stopped eating here because of the rushed poorly presented food and bad service. Today I was pleasantly surprised! Four stars for the great service this afternoon. Stephanie was courteous  prompt and attentive to our needs. As far as the food is concerned it's good  not great but it's way better than the last time I wrote a review a few years ago. I get a little concerned about the quality of the service and the food when the restaurant is busy. We were there late afternoon so it was pretty quiet. I still think even if it was busy Stephanie would have been able to handle it. I may almost be convinced to come back. I have to test it out on a busy day to confirm things have changed!
Courtney K.,Union City  CA,53,253,363,2/19/2013,4.0,I love BJ's  I was so happy when this location opened because the only one around was in Cupertino. I love their artichoke & spinach pizza  avocado eggrolls and scampi pasta! Also you can't go to BJ's and not get a pizookie  you just wound't be doing it right. I also like the fact that you can call when you're on your way to put your name in.
Harry G.,Union City  CA,10,60,16,9/13/2015,2.0,A very busy  noisy  popular restaurant with attentive service. However  the food was mediocre. The Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was dry. The Cajun pasta with shrimp was bountiful but the noodles were overcooked and sauce was very watery. The angel hair pasta dish was bland.
J S.,Maine  NY,0,57,16,10/26/2015,3.0,Not too bad for a chain. Ordered Santa Fe salad and a few house beers. Not the best option but adequate for dinner.
Sally M.,San Bruno  CA,73,10,3,5/20/2015,1.0,My family and I came to eat here  we received nothing but bad customer service. The greeters and seaters were talking gossiping when we walked in. When we finally got seated  it took the waiter 30 minutes to introduce himself and ask us what we wanted to drink. When we finally our waiter finally came and we ordered our drinks it took him another 30 minutes for a cup of water! The waiter was really rude! When he came to give us our check  he slammed it on the table and walked away! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!
Tea D.,Redwood City  CA,35,16,8,5/4/2015,2.0,Food is exactly like all the other BJ'S out there. This one however has horrible service. Went there for their late night and it took 15mins to just be greeted.
Bevi K.,Newark  CA,134,321,104,6/27/2014,3.0,This is a great spot to indulge in food that's bad for you  and have a good time with friends. It is ALWAYS packed  so be prepared to wait. The customer service has gotten better over the years  but it's still not the best. It takes quite some time for the food to get ready  and you will have to flag people to get refills. Be extremely clear with your order  especially if you're going to do any substitutions  theres usually always something wrong with it.
Trusha S.,Fremont  CA,34,65,9,6/10/2015,2.0,I have been to BJ's countless times  which is why I am giving this two stars. I really do think in recent time  the whole experience has gone down. I came here with a couple friends to watch the Warriors NBA Finals game. As expected  the place was crowded. It didn't seem like they had prepared for the rush as when I walked in they told me they only had 4 servers for the entire place. I didn't know how I was to respond to that  so I sat anyways. Between my friends and I we ordered a couple drinks  appetizers  and pizza from the happy hour menu. We got the drinks and appetizers  and 45 minutes after we ordered our pizzas still weren't here. I knew it was crowded  but this was too long so I asked the waitress to check on the food. She comes back 15 minutes later with two pizzas. She hands me mine and said it had been sitting out for awhile  because somebody dropped my friends' pizza on accident without telling anyone. She claimed they had reheated mine and gave it to me and brings out some other pizza for my friend  a different one than the one she ordered which was really odd. My friend sent it back because the pizza she brought out had pork  which she doesn't eat. And my pizza was cold! Even though she said she reheated it. I sent mine back to be heated AGAIN. Finally she comes back with my pizza and the pizza my friend had ordered. But since mine had been reheated so many times  it was soggy! It literally felt like they had just put it in the microwave it was gross. Finally when the bill came  she charges us the regular price for all the food and drinks instead of the happy hour price! That was really frustrating  and is a huge mistake. When we told her she wasn't very apologetic and just said she would talk to her manager. Especially when going during happy hour  make sure that people double check their bills as the servers don't seem to be doing their job properly.This place is understaffed  and the waiters they do have are incompetent. They really need to get better. I am only giving 2 stars based on my past experiences here over the years where it was MUCH better.
Erik R.,Newark  CA,119,1,2,9/19/2015,4.0,Kelli was an awesome server! But the manager Evan was was really unprofessional when he yelled at her in public for getting a different drink we ordered. It was a misunderstanding on the order not her fault and he was a big douchbag about it and made it awkward. He need to be more respectful to his employees and the customers seeing that... But food was excellent and our server was great!
John Y.,San Jose  CA,3,44,1,8/6/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I complained in their website and to my surprise not only did the regional rep contactMe but also the manager of the place. They both apologized profusely and vowed to correct the injustice I experienced. In addition they gave me a 50 dollar credit towards my next meal. So I give them kudos for the follow up. I hope they corrected their process so that no one ever experiences the horror I experienced.
Chris A.,Fremont  CA,0,37,,9/15/2015,3.0,Thoroughly enjoy the beer selection there as well as the pizza. The entrees are hit or miss but there is a significant variety of items. The waits are generally not long going at 7P but I have noticed that the cleanliness of the table/menus is lacking. Pizookie is really good if you have room at the end!
Miranda C.,Hayward  CA,251,1,2,11/8/2015,5.0,April  our server was great! Best customer service Ive had in awhile. She made sure my drink was always filled. Bubbly personality. Next time I wanr her as my server.
Chantelina J.,Fremont  CA,138,149,37,4/6/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I'd say the service in this restaurant has up'd their game! This review is for Kyle  who was the waiter for my husband and I on Saturday night. He was very attentive with our table and was also very personable. He wasn't overbearing like some waiters are in other restaurants. He asked all the right questions and managed to make sure our orders were put in correctly. He definitely made our dinner much more enjoyable knowing that he took care of us. Thank you  Kyle!
Flo C.,San Jose  CA,2,7,2,5/15/2014,3.0,Jon-Paul my waiter was very nice. However the quality of food was poor ... An there was a DOG in the restaurant ! I almost wanted to throw up !
Aarron W.,Orange  CA,480,516,393,12/14/2012,3.0,Came here for lunch  and ordered chicken tortilla soup  and half of a chicken club sandwich. The waitress Cynthia was very polite and friendly  no problems with her. The soup was awesome  didn't taste too salty. The sandwich wasn't that great  it came with a greasy sourdough bread. The pizza here is awesome so I would come back. One more tip  the menu had about 30 pages and is confusing. It's better to do a few things awesome than a ton of items that are so/so.
Arvindram R.,Tracy  CA,104,154,1003,5/10/2014,3.0,Have been at this place for almost not less than 60 times  used to be an awesome place with great food and Beer  happy hours used to be really Happy with 1/2 price regular sized appetizers. Some corporate changes happened which wanted to profit out of the venture and from then the food quality worsened  prices went up and portion size started diminishing. Come on BJs we used to be friends  let's get back on track with quality and value for customers.
Matt A.,Rochester  NY,15,8,,11/29/2014,1.0,Service was slow.  I came here around 2 on a Saturday and sat at a half empty bar.  It took over 10 minutes for the bartender to come over and take my drink order.  He stated the taps obscured his view of me so he didn't know I was there... Really?  I ordered fried calamari just to have something to chew on during that football games.  While the portion was good size  it was soggy and very greasy.  Disgusting. If you can't get that right then there is no point in trying anything else.The beer was good though.
David O.,Oakland  CA,133,16,1,9/4/2015,2.0,Where do I even begin to tell you how terrible this place was. I guess I'll start with the two positives  it was clean and the server was nice. It all goes downhill from there. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta  I'm a huge fan of shrimp scampi at that....worst ever  the shrimp was burned  so was the pasta  sent it back and it came back worse than the first time. I ceased my complaints and just ate it. No seasoning  didn't bring me ground pepper or lemons until I finally asked for a to go box because I couldn't do it anymore. The place wasn't even busy and they brought me my check in record speed. Would never EVER come back for anything but some happy hour booze. My advice  STAY AWAY from anything that requires the cooks to COOK
Rusty C.,Royal Oak  MI,0,32,,10/1/2015,4.0,I ate here quite a bit while in Newark on business. I mostly sat at the bar. The atmosphere is an upscale sports bar. They have very good happy hour specials for food and beer. The beer options are fantastic. They have a bunch of TVs and are always playing a game on them. My type of place. The service was okay but not great.
Tony L.,Fremont  CA,418,35,,3/12/2015,3.0,This place was packed when the family decided to try it out. The parking was problematic and the wait time was long but everyone seemed to have a good time and the food was decent. Nothing special.
Hahn N.,San Ramon  CA,2,42,5,4/19/2016,2.0,Definitely not my best visit unfortunately. I decided to take my kids to lunch before some fun activity and arrived around 2:30. The hostess took us to our table and after that we didn't see a waiter for ten minutes to take our order for drinks or food. Our waitress eventually showed up and attempted to take our order but she failed to listen to us as we had to repeat ourselves 3 times. She left and we doubted we were going to have the right drinks but she got it after all. She took our food order and had really bad attitude as if we were an inconvenience to her and what she was doing. The food came and my sandwich was super dry. The toast was burnt and the chicken was dry. I ordered the wedge salad which resulted in a bath of dressing which ultimately ruined the meal in the long end. I've had this same meal now twice and for going on a busy Saturday dinner with a great experience to this on a dead Friday lunch time  pretty upsetting.Our waitress checked on us about 10 minutes after someone else brought out our food. Again the tude... Then she went over to the wrap around booth next to us full of young guys with the most energetic greeting and made flirtatious talk. We later learned it was another employee and his buddies. Another waitress joined her as they all talked. She then came back with her tude to see if we needed anything else. We ordered two pazookies and she looked at us like we were crazy to want to order them. She dropped off our tab and went to her buddies at the booth for more flirting. Our pazookies arrived  we ate them and I left the worse tip I've ever left anyone. Feeling guilty but the service wasn't even tipable. Sorry Rosario but you really shouldn't be a server if you can't treat all your guests equally and lose the tude.
Chris H.,Fremont  CA,0,3,,5/30/2016,2.0,terrible service. called ahead and made a reservation  which was lost. waited an awfully long time for a table  especially for having called ahead. servers took 15 minutes to come take our drink order  and he only has two tables. appetizers came out incorrectly  drinks were changed without warning  and the meat is chewy. any one of these would be tolerable  but all snowballing together? come on. very disappointed. also  don't change every single tv to one single game when there are multiple  local teams in playoffs. easily fixable things  remedied by a staff who is present and cares about customer service.
Lyn W.,Fremont  CA,0,25,99,9/22/2015,2.0,"My friends and I come here often for happy hour. My hubby and I tried for a late dinner to see if our experience for dining in would be different.First of all their hostess (one female and a male that night) are rude. No smile no greetings just out right ""for how many"" is how they started. The hostess told us that the wait is about 10-15 minutes  so we figured... Oh ok the wait isn\'t that bad. Wrong! 35 minutes later our name wasn\'t called yet  so I ask the hostess about what happened to the 10-15 minutes wait? She said well there\'s a lot of people and you probably have to wait another 10-15 minutes more. The sad things is I keep seeing they\'re giving other people with a party of 3 and more a buzzer to let them know their table is ready but they didn\'t give us a buzzer. The couple who was in line before me had already been seated long time ago and other people with buzzers already been seated and we are still waiting. 45 minutes later and we are so hungry  our names had not been called yet. We decided to wait an available seat at the bar and when my hubby finally got one  we decided to just eat there.So after an hour we finally got seated at the bar and got our order taken immediately. I have BJ\'s two starts for the waitress who served us with a smile and for the waiter who cleaned out the table so we can seat and eat. All in all the hostess needs to do more training about customer service. Other than that food is good. Won\'t be dining again at the Dining hall but would eat at the bar only."
Veronica A.,Union City  CA,272,898,367,4/2/2012,5.0,In reading the reviews  we came here not expecting very much...and we were pleasantly surprised!Came here for lunch and we got here at around 11:30 which was good because around noon it started to get packed. Courtney was our waitress and she was great! She was friendly  came to check on us  and brought our food out in a timely manner. We noticed she didn't write down our orders and she mentioned she's been a waitress for 5 years. After having a very horrible experience with a waitress at ANOTHER restaurant which I will not mention here  we were so happy that we found a wonderful waitress that took care of us and we were able to enjoy our lunch without stressing out about bad service. Avocado eggrolls- deliciousChicken wings- very goodPomegrante Margarita-strong and goodParmessan crusted chicken-it was okJalapeno burger-very tasty  loved the fried jalapenosWe ordered some stuff to go and that took a long time  but it was probably because the placed was packed to the gills.Will def come back.
Eric F.,San Leandro  CA,735,2518,266,6/3/2012,2.0,I've had mixed experiences with the BJ's service depending on how busy it's been  but our waitress was pretty dismal - she wasn't the slyest about chatting it up with her friends at another table while making us wait for extended periods without food & drink.As for the fare itself  I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't mind the nachos every once in a while  but the deep dish pizza is really sub-par after seeing what it should actually taste like in Chicago. The dough is thick and bland  boring my palate within a couple bites. At least the pizookie is still a decent dessert. For beers  the Hopstorm IPA had an odd  unpleasant sweetness...so it worked out that our waitress forgot to come back and take my order after trying the skosh XDAll in all  it's def worth the further drive down to Yard House if you're in the mood for some happy hour snacks & beer.
Tiffani H.,Mountain View  CA,2,1,,12/29/2014,1.0,"Turn around don\'t do it. This was the worst dining experience I\'ve ever had. Horrible service and apparently normal car break ins in their lot. Every year we have friends fly in from Southern California. We decided to try something new and go to Bj\'s. Never again. Here\'s a summary: **The manager very casually comes to our table and asks if anyone drives a VW... And then says ""oh ok because it just was broken in to"" and walks away. We found out from the bus boy that car theft and break ins happen 2-3 times a day In their lot. Hello jerk...WARN YOUR PATRONS!!!!! It took 15-20 for anyone to come to our table. (The place was not at all packed) Only half of our 25 person party was brought waters/offered appetizersOur waitress kept forgetting our orders(write it down dummy) The guy bringing out the food was rude and kept yelling at us  throwing our plates on the table: his shirt was dirty and untucked   he was not happy to have to be at work. Very unprofessional. The orders kept coming out wrong. We weren\'t brought napkins until the end after several requests. Water refills never offered. Very rude response to the car being broken in to. Absolutely the lowest level of customer service I\'ve ever had and on top of that....THE FOOD SUCKED. don\'t do it people. This location should just be torn down."
Valerie H.,Fremont  CA,19,12,2,7/24/2014,5.0,Great food. Parking lot security person is inside talking to the girls at the desk.Car break-ins are frequent here. Do not leave valuables in car!!!!!!
Amanda H.,Aurora  CO,10,42,14,3/11/2014,3.0,We called ahead and there was a 45 minute wait  when we arrived about 30 minutes later we were seated immediately. It did take a little while for our server to free us but once she did she was amazing and attentive. Unfortunately the chef of the night wasn't up to par. We ordered the cheese sticks and calamari as appetizers. A individual sweet pig pizza  a burger  chicken salad and a pasta. My fianc ordered his burger medium rare and received a medium well. My pizza was extremely limp and didn't have any pizza sauce! I think the recipe for the thin crust is not a good one as it was extremely soggy. Typically I get the deep dish which is so good. Anyways  the server had my pizza remade which took about 10 minutes. The second go around it had sauce but again soggy. The manager came by and comped my pizza. Which is much appreciated. Only complaint about the server is the fact that she did not let me know root beer was not free refills and they were 3 bucks a pop! However  one of my rootbeers was also comped so I ended up paying just for 1. We still left the server a 20% tip as the meal was not her fault. Having been a server before I really appreciate the fact she got a manager involved. So many times I've gotten the wrong meal or soggy or something and servers just don't care and don't offer anything. At that point I say sorry server no tip for you!
Lina H.,Newark  CA,680,633,692,1/2/2014,2.0,Very  very disappointed. I was looking for a spot to catch the Sharks game and I figured BJs would have it. I found parking relatively close to the entrance  and walked right in. When I got close to the bar I was shocked to see they were not showing the Sharks game!!! At least not in the 4 TVs right in front of the bar. :( When I asked the bartender about the Sharks game he pointed towards the TV on the side of the restaurant  nowhere close to the bar. So basically if I wanted to watch the game I was going to have to get a booth or table in the dining area. I was definitely not hungry nor did I want to wait an hour to get seated!!! So  I simply walked out and drove myself to Jacks Brewing where they had two TVs right at the bar showing my precious black and teal Sharks. ;)
Judy W.,Oakland  CA,411,343,133,5/11/2012,3.0,it's a decent chain  nice choices on tap. Prices is similar to Cheesecake Factory. Their deep dish pizzas are pretty delish!! I probably wouldn't come here  unless it's for someones bday.. lol. It's not really a place where they have food that I crave. Pizookie is amazing thought! you guys definitely need to try it out!!! If you havent been there yet  grab some buddies  order a pitcher of beer  get the largest deep dish pizza and finish your meal off with a cookie with ice cream on time. YUMMMMMMMS
Meghian G.,Livermore  CA,34,3,,1/17/2015,1.0,We went to BJs for brunch  we waited 5 minutes and no one came to seat us. The restaurant was not busy at all. We wanted to try the brunch cuz we seen it last time we had dinner but no one is available to help you. I wouldn't recommend them for brunch.
Mike W.,Fremont  CA,86,3,,2/14/2015,1.0,I called in yesterday and asked if I could get a copy of a receipt for a meal I had eaten here the day before so I could get reimbursed by my company. I was told that if I came in and spoke to the manager I could get the receipt. I went out of my way to drive all the way over there and when I arrived the manager informed me that he did not have the time to get me the receipt. I completely understand that this was my mistake but I should have been informed that it was not possible. This was a waste of my time and BJ's lost a customer because of it. Learn how to put the customer first!
Lorna P.,Fremont  CA,55,17,10,8/4/2015,3.0,Great selection of beers. Love that they have my favorite Belgium Lambic beer on tap! Food was average. Chicken lettuce wraps and tomato mozzarella sale were my favorites. But definitely have a wide selection of menu items. Got a decent deal for happy hour. Super busy  so bartenders had somewhat of a hard time keeping up  but were pretty cool. I'd probably go back if someone else were picking the restaurant.
Diana H.,Davis  CA,176,41,280,6/1/2014,5.0,Late night service was great. The house was packed but the wait was reasonable. No complaints. Calamari appetizer was a own and the strawberry splash is a definite favorite. Bathrooms were clean which is always a plus.
Christian Y.,Fremont  CA,1,1,,9/20/2015,1.0,Horrible service. Waited one hour for dessert while the table next to us for it before us although we ordered first. Long wait for entrees and pizzas burnt and cold. Food is really small in portions and tastes bad.
Manushi P.,Union City  CA,0,20,5,8/22/2014,3.0,We have been to this place couple of time. We loved their pita wrap   pizza. Stuffed mushroom is delicious.
Gina R.,Glenmoor  CA,27,29,7,10/17/2015,3.0,I give it a 3 star customer service was excellent can't complain on that. There was only 2 min wait to be seated. They got our food pretty quickly. My only complaint is the food sucks!!!i ordered a chicken Alfredo fettuccine and it wasn't good it seemed like they pored sauce from store those cheap ones. The bread sticks were over toasted too hard to give it a bite. Before maybe two years ago it was so much better! But now maybe it's the cook I don't know but I sure as hell didn't like my plate I will not be coming here anymore Olive Garden is soo much better! The pazooki here is hella good!
Shital B.,Fremont  CA,0,1,,4/27/2016,1.0,We were group of 11 people 4 people ordered chicken dish which very salty. The service really sucks. Never coming back here.
Michelle A.,Hayward  CA,45,79,20,5/21/2015,5.0,I have been here countless times but tonight can't beat the amazing service I received from darren not only did he make fantastic recommendations but he was just an all around pleasant person to be around. He helped get the night started with his positive attitude and round of drinks that he kept up with follow ups which is hard to come by. Big tip and a hi - five bjs!
Sharon B.,Newark  CA,33,9,5,9/14/2014,4.0,Worst Service ever; But  to their credit  they never gave up!We had party of 16 reservations for 6 pm a week in advance. Checked in 6:03. Were told it might be a min. We checked in again at 6:20 & had to wait 10 more min. It was obvious they had lost our reservation especially after we were finally brought to our seating. We were cramped & overcrowded  against a wall. we're a big family  so we're used to it. They brought complimentary cheese sticks to apologize within 5 minutes of seating us  but didn't take our drink order for another 10 min. They forgot 4 out of 6 requests for water.  Then 10 more min to order. By then we were getting very hungry had been there almost an hour  so we ordered 3 more apps & all our entrees. They brought the apps but no plates  we had to ask 2 times. I sent a drink back because I didn't like it. I had ordered it  but it was very sweet. The server brought me something else right away. Our food came at 7:30  most of it anyway. They had forgotten to order 4 entrees  & had made 1 entree twice. They took that back.  I later found out that my grandaughter had ordered one kind of soup but had been given another. (It was her birthday.) I asked why she didn't tell us. She said she was just too hungry to send it back. I asked if she liked it  she said it was not her favorite but she didn't care.  About now you must think we're a bunch of complainers and eventually we did all get fed. It just took so long lots mistakes. I had the salmon it was sooooo good. The manager was very kind  he came over personally & apologized directly to me  then comped my salmon dinner. After all the mishaps I certainly appreciated that gesture. We left about 8:40. I've heard in Europe things are done at a very leisurely pace  perhaps we melded into a worm hole for the evening.We were hungry and cranky  but rolled w the flow as best we could; we did not get great service; but  they never gave up on us  were never rude  and the food was quite good.  If you're wondering  we tipped 20% we're not jerks!
Mechelle A.,Hayward  CA,129,97,306,4/4/2014,5.0,I went there last night and John Paul was my waiter ... He was off the hook ... i own a restaurant and I know how important it is about service to every one ... from the minute he walked to the table and til the minute we left he was outstanding... him being so great and on point made everything taste better
Radio G.,Livermore  CA,1,11,1,3/2/2015,2.0,Slow. Like. Reading. This. Sentence. Service. Do. Not. Go. There. Hungry. o. M. G. Where is the food. This is the second time it has taken more than 45 minutes for a simple pasta dish. I won't be back.
Jerry R.,Fremont  CA,1,1,1,9/11/2014,2.0,Came in about 11ish for a late dinner. Sat in the bar area. Took about 20 minutes til our server came. It seems like he was more concerned about taking to a girl at the bar then attending his tables. We ordered a pizza and appitizer. Thinking that our appitizer would come out before our pizza it ended up coming out at the same time. A little disappointed to be waiting so long for. The appitizer ends being served to us cold. SMH. On another note thanks to the supervisor to assisiting us in our problem.
Tine G.,Union City  CA,4,4,,1/21/2015,1.0,Nayeli was our server tonight. She completely forgot that we had mentioned that we came to BJ's to celebrate my mom's birthday. Instead  when we ordered a pizookie after dinner  we thought she was bringing the one with the candle to us and got excited. Nope. She brought it to the table next to us. All night we saw people celebrating birthdays but our idiot server completely forgot about my mom. No one disrespects my mom like that. Never celebrating anything here again  thanks to NAYELI.
Ryan A.,Hayward  CA,154,371,158,1/8/2014,5.0,BJ's is the new age family restaurant. The trend setter. That used to be Chilis. Applebee's  Fridays  used to copy Chilis. Now all 3 copy BJ's. BJ's menu is huge  their food is hot  fresh  & tasty. I come to this location for lunch often. Good service  good food.
Audra M.,East Bay  CA,47,382,537,2/3/2012,5.0,I have to give this location 5 stars for their great service. We have been there twice in the last month and both times we were greeted by friendly people and our waiters were both excellent. The place is always I mean ALWAYS crowded  but the waiters still treat you like your their only customer. The food is great  I haven't had any issues with the food. But my 5 stars is for their excellent customer service.
Suzi L.,Hayward  CA,3,11,49,3/27/2014,5.0,This place is really good for party's. The food is great and the servers are very efficient. Jk. Sometimes they suck but I really enjoy drinking and eating so yea I give it 2 thumbs up!!
Garrett C.,Fremont  CA,238,4,,9/20/2015,1.0,I used to enjoy this place but after today the service is just horrible. The food is okay but the portions seem to have been reduced. After our main meals  the desserts took almost 20 minutes to arrive. The server spoke very quietly and I almost thought they couldn't speak English. Probably won't come back again.
Andrea F.,Fremont  CA,13,20,7,7/22/2015,1.0,Never made it in the door! We have been to BJ's before and while I don't think I would give it a 5 star rating  it was acceptable. We tried to go there for dinner last night. There is a lot of new construction that has caused most of their parking lost to be torn out. We drove around the entire lot several times  which is now about 1/2 the size it used to be. There was no parking. Pretty frustrating especially looking at the size of the construction project and the fact that it looks like it will be this way for a long time.
Andy B.,San Ramon  CA,5,100,288,5/8/2014,3.0,Not really wanting to come back to BJ's after eating their pasta. VERY oily and unappetizing since the pasta and sauce had a congealed texture and taste to it. As for the appetizers  they were okay. Not very memorable. The day I went was for my cousin's birthday dinner. We also had dessert there  and I didn't feel satisfied from the portions I had there. I wouldn't come back  especially when the service was just okay.Oh yeah  and when I thought I had left my iPad in the restaurant and called the restaurant to see if they found it  the employee who answered the phone wasn't even apologetic about my concern when I explained the situation. Thankfully  my iPad was found under my car seat  so I was so relieved when I saw it there.We had a BJ's back in my hometown  and I'm glad I never went there.
Rami A.,Redwood City  CA,0,1,,4/8/2016,1.0,Wife ordered her burger well done  and it came out medium. Ordered a great white pizza and it came out completely cold. Sent it back for another one  and the new pizza had no sauce and no mushrooms. Gave up at that point and just ate it. Very disappointing.
Alejandra J.,Hayward  CA,7,37,5,5/17/2015,4.0,Drinks are delicious  and all the bartenders I've met are really nice with great service !
Samantha R.,San Francisco  CA,0,34,,1/13/2014,1.0,Crappy customer service. Was waiting to be seated and the hostess forgot about us and seated someone else. LOLOL maybe the place needs lighting or she needs glasses?? Yup not coming back. Also it takes years to get your food.....
D. L.,Santa Clara  CA,4,14,,3/7/2016,5.0,"I have hosted a few BJ\'s pizza events in the past at different locations and this was the best overall experience. I hosted my son\'s birthday party here over the weekend and everything was expedited perfectly. My contact with Evan  the restaurant manager  was primarily thru email and he called me the morning of to confirm the party. Evan was professional and easy to talk to. Upon arrival  the room was set up exactly how I requested it to be  specifically a gift table  a kids table. And Jocelyn was our ""person""...she was on it! Sweet  patient  accommodating. Our party of 50 didn\'t intimidate her at all! She was awesome! We did a package that had replenish-able pizza  pasta  salad  and drinks! And Evan and jocelyn never made the food go empty! It kept coming and my guests were fed well! I really have no complaints! Thank you Bj\'s Newark...Evan & Jocelyn...for a smooth and memorable party. Everyone had a great time!"
Lexie P.,Fremont  CA,571,39,4,5/15/2015,4.0,My overall FAVORITE restaurant in Fremont. I've come here countless times and for the most part  I've always received great customer service with great quality food. I usually order the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. I sometimes get the caesar salad  clam chowder  or five meet deep dish pizza. I almost ALWAYS get a pizookie. I'm extremely sad that they don't have red velvet anymore but I have enjoyed the peanut butter s'mores pizookie and I always love the traditional chocolate chip. They've raised their prices a little bit within the last 5-6 years but I'm still a fan  especially since they have their rewards system. I usually rack up enough points for a reward/coupon within 2-3 visits. I also get weekly emails with their specials and coupons  which usually gets me to come in.
Dinesh C.,Fremont  CA,0,15,,7/30/2014,1.0,After a long wait we got seated and ordered our appetizers  drinks and kids food which was served promptly. We then ordered our entree - pizza  which took over an hour. The manager realized this before we could bring it up and apologized and said he would comp us for that. At this time we were glad they realized their mistake and that they took to steps to correct and act upon it. We ordered dessert for the kids who were getting restless by now. This took over an hour and our server was nowhere to be seen. We asked another server to call the manager and then our desserts show up. We asked our server to call the manager and she said she would but never did. We had asked for a glass of water and that too took over half an hour. I'm glad they comp'ed us for the pizza - but spending two and half hours for a dinner with hunbgry kids totally ruined the night. I would never go again.
Miss H K.,San Francisco  CA,446,957,1925,9/9/2011,4.0,Came here tonight for dinner with friends and was more satisfied than I thought I'd be!I called in 30 min in advance to put our name on the wait list  when we got there it was packed  however we only had to wait about 10 extra mins to be seated-seems the wait was due to short staff vs open tables.I ordered the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was tasty and was served over fettucini noodles with green beans. My dish was good  I liked the noodles with it. Also tried the red velvet pizookie for dessert which was also sweet.Service was fine and the prices here are affordable for family dining.I'd definitely recommend calling in advance for a table but wouldn't mind returning here in the future. Good for groups.
Jelani W.,Hayward  CA,0,1,,10/18/2014,1.0,This is the worst place to eat my food had a toe nail and a spider in it then I tried to get something else and they told me to get out and me and my grandma left then she fell off the curb because her starvation
Maria C.,Fremont  CA,0,59,,9/25/2014,2.0,"BJs. Where to begin?Well  first there\'s the name. We\'ll leave that for a site that won\'t chuck this review based on it\'s user policy :)We\'ve been in and out of this BJs for over a year  and while I fell in love with this chain in Boulder  CO  it\'s not the best here. Why  you ask?Noise-------the noise level in here is off the chain ridiculous. We\'ve canned it from our moms-night-out list of places to go because even yelling  we often can\'t hear each other. And I don\'t want to yell at people I like. I\'d like to yell at the wait service  though.Wait Service--------------Listen. I get it. You\'re underpaid  supposed to make your cash on tips  have too many tables  and I\'m sure some of us customers aren\'t as nice as the others. But seriously  don\'t help make the situation worse  cuz  as they say  it\'s the little things. Like when you bring a tray of 4 drinks to the table but 3 straws. And then say you\'re sorry  you\'ll be right back with one. But never come back. Or  when you come to the table with hot soup  but there\'s no spoon. And say you\'ll be right back with one. But then proceed to take the order of the table RIGHT BEHIND US. You realize we can hear you  right? We can see you  right? That\'s just a slap in the face  in my opinion. It\'s like saying  ""You know  Mr Customer  I know you can\'t order your own soup and get it from the kitchen. So I\'m going to let that HOT dish sit in front of you and grow colder by the minute  until I damn well feel like getting a spoon for you."" YOU set the expectation - YOU said you\'d go get it... and yet you don\'t. For 9.8 minutes  on average  over 4 visits. Yes  it got so bad that we\'d TIME YOU over MANY visits and chuckle as the $20 bills passed hands  bets collected and cashed in  winners and losers announced  as we gambled on how long you\'d be gone. You want a tip? Give me service. You want a good tip Give me good service. You want a great tip? Well  you get the idea.The Food-----------As a first time reviewer of you  but long time eater in your chain  I understand that I\'m emotionally scarred from your chain\'s decision to pull the stuffed baked potatoes. I admit  I was a bit miffed when I was told that  after WANTING to pay for a $10 potato (come on  let\'s just say it  we all know it\'s really worth $1.50 in costs)  that you\'re complaining to me about the time it takes the kitchen to prepare it. Which tells me the kitchen isn\'t looking to cook  they\'re looking to reheat. Which brings me to the last point - the food quality is OK  for what it is - but it could be so much better  particularly when the menu is priced squarely in the average range of $14/item  $20-$22/meal. And when we leave? Yup  you guessed it. My man wants to visit McDonalds  because he\'s still hungry.Quality--------I want to end on this final note. You are what you serve  in the restaurant business; a lot of times we\'ll put up with crappy wait service  or rude wait service  or NO wait service  if there\'s good food and drink. However  you sold me a roughly $4 cream soda with no carbonation. After asking for something with bubbles  and being looked at with incredulity (because  you know  customers take a perfectly fine glass  drink none of it  and send it back for fun  and you  you decide you\'re the soda police and want to question my word  despite seeing not a single bubble on the side of the glass)  take 15 minutes to work it out with the bar  who tells you there\'s something wrong with the batch  and there are no more batches. OK  I\'m disappointed  but things happen  I get it  let\'s move on. Imagine my surprise when I saw more trays of bad-batch soda being served to other customers. It\'s a small thing  I know  but for a chain making it\'s name on the every-so-hot marketing monikers of ""Hand-crafted"" sodas  it tells me that you knew there was a problem (despite how we got to that discovery)  and continued to serve it anyways. Which makes me wonder about what\'s on my plate. EEKS."
Bhargav S.,Fremont  CA,0,2,,4/1/2016,1.0,"When you order a vegetarian penne make sure they don\'t give you a shrimp penne!!! When you accidentally have one and tell the server  this is not a vegetarian penne... He simply laughs and says ""boss haven\'t you ever seen a shrimp before  you should have checked!"" Yeah rite!! It was not funny dude!!! Its not funny to have eaten a shrimp when you have been a vegetarian all your life! I hope you guys see the order before you cook!"
Megha R.,San Jose  CA,1,17,,7/25/2015,4.0,The ambience  service and food was absolutely amazing! I tried a quinoa for the first time and loved it. It was a herb roasted chicken on quinoa. I found the chicken a little overcooked because it was chewy but the flavors that it was cooked in were amazing. I wish it was a little less tangy though. I saw a few fried calamari and some avocado egg rolls being ordered on my table and everybody loved them. The Cajun pasta with chicken was nice and creamy too. If you get a chance to be there and love chocolate do try out the triple chocolate Ghirardelli brownie and icecream. Thumbs up on the food and service!
Bernadette M.,Hayward  CA,609,651,1036,10/21/2013,5.0,"This place is always packed! Thank goodness Mervyn\'s closed because there wouldn\'t be any parking. I felt like I parked out in the boonies and had to go over the river and thru the woods to get to the restaurant. Sheesh!It was just a girls night and we were quoted a 30-minute wait but I opted to sit in the bar area and stood there like a hungry hawk waiting for a table to open up. Other folks were doing the same thing and the servers will have a stern ""excuse me"" if you\'re in their way while carrying drinks and food to their tables. Understandable. Thankfully two seats opened up at the bar and you can\'t go wrong getting service by the bartenders and having four different games to watch up on their large screen. We had some drinks  a standard vodka tonic cocktail for me  and beer for my gf. We decided on the artichoke dip as an app  she went with the balsamic chicken with potatoes and I wanted to venture out from my usual avocado rolls and called on Yelp for recommendations. The white pizza was the first to get a recommendation so I went with that. It was good and the mini size was perfect for me. Matter of fact  I took half of it home for lunch the next day. I prefer the Buffalo Chicken Pizza over that one. And the Balsamic Chicken was tasty. My gf finished her dish without a problem. The dip app was small. Not enough dip for the amount of chips that they give you and for $8.The other patrons were very friendly. Nice conversation and even free beignet dessert for moving over one seat to make room for a gent\'s guest. AND a recommended beer float was given to my girlfriend as well. Score! Service was friendly and helpful."
Kevin S.,San Leandro  CA,0,16,4,5/29/2015,1.0,Here I am waiting in bj's waiting to 've seated for the past hour and 45 minutes. After being told it would be a 1 hour wait. Children are hungry. I've worked a long day. Still no help from the staff. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.
Delency P.,Newark  CA,0,1,,8/22/2015,1.0,Ive experienced better service at marine world on a hot summer day in the funnel cake line. My cousin couldn't leave the restaurant without taking a shit.
Rebecca P.,Milpitas  CA,178,104,88,12/20/2013,1.0,If I can give zero stars  I would. We got here at 7. They told us 45 minutes. It's now 9 pm and they keep giving us the run around. Every time we check how long  they tell us another 15 minutes. At 845  we ask how long the wait is. And they said 15 minutes. 45 minutes has passed.. They said another 30 minutes. On top of that  my friend ordered calamari and hour ago and still hasn't gotten it. They brought the check over. Calamari was on it but we never received it. Bad service? Yes! We have been waiting over 2 hours and other people have been getting seated before us. We only have a 10 people party. This is really bullshit. I can't say how the food is because we still haven't gotten seated!
Concepcion B.,Palo Alto  CA,73,9,8,3/1/2016,1.0,WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER!! If I could I would put ZERO stars. It's my 2 year olds birthday and we decided to grab a late lunch here because it seemed family friendly. Everything was okay until 10 min after we left. My husband realized he accidentally left his sunglasses on the table. So I call right away to tell them. We were told no sunglasses found. My husband was 1000% sure it was left on the table. I told the gal on the phone to check again. Not only was I left on hold for 20 min  my husband calls on the other line and they answered right away. So either I was being left on hold on purpose or they were hoping I would hang up  or both (and IT WAS NOT BUSY  maybe only two other customers at the time). Who ever my husband talk to on the phone sounded like she was laughing and sarcastic. So my husband went back right away. When he got there the manager said they already looked and asked everyone. My husband said he wanted to talk to the busboy or whom ever cleared our table. The busboy came out and said he TOLD the manager and everyone he DID FIND THEM and placed them up front with the host. Somehow they made their way back somewhere else and TWO MINUTES LATER THE MANAGER GAVE THEM TO MY HUSBAND. DISHONEST BUNCH OF MF's!! Ok so they were just sunglasses. Well expensive sunglasses but that is beside the point. DISHONESTY AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!
Ruben O.,Newark  CA,36,22,3,7/20/2015,4.0,This was a mixed bag of good and okay. Let me start of with saying the wait was a bit long all around [getting seated  drinks  food  etc....] The food was okay but nothing special  Calamari was cooked well and seasoned nicely but kind of a small portion and forgettable flavor. Avacado egg rolls were.... Different  but not in a bad way. Drinks were either too strong or too sweet  Pizza was mostly dough and although the dough was good the toppings and sauce just didn't have enough flavor for my liking. Now for the saving grace though  that damn Pazookie. It's worth the price of admission alone  warm soft cookie with some type of dessert sauce and a big scoop of ice cream. #FoodOfGods
Kellie N.,Atlanta  GA,240,389,464,12/18/2011,4.0,"I love that they have a light bites section and an appetizer section. I sat at the bar and had a couple items off the lite bites menu. Seared ahi and tomato and mozzarella salad. Both were amazing.I\'m not a beer drinker  however  the most amazing bartender  Melissa let me try one of their light beer\'s liked it...maybe when it is warm outside I will have one.Great staff  friendly and fast service. I also loved that in the middle of the afternoon  the ""regulars"" come in and were greeted by name by the bartenders. The menu is so huge and they tell you the calories in each item."
Lorelei B.,Hayward  CA,12,19,37,6/17/2014,3.0,I ordered my food online to dine-in since i only have one hour of lunch because i thought it would be faster that way. So they worked on my order and i waited for awhile just to get my drink. Finally my order came  but they did not customize my food like i asked. I asked for extra mushrooms and they did not put any. So i left it as is. I asked to get a refill and it took a good 10 minutes just to get it. Then I asked for dessert and it took another 15 minutes to wait... I was already 15 minutes late to get back to work when i got my dessert. Waitress didn't smile that much. She was just ok. Overall  the only thing that was great was their food. Customer Service however was pretty slow.
Tim M.,Hendersonville  NC,13,63,66,2/17/2014,4.0,The burger I ordered and had delivered was fantastic! It was cooked precisely as ordered and was delivered hot and tasty. This was definitely the best burger I've had in the Newark area. I opted for the thin fries instead of crinkled. They were hot  but like fries delivered from anywhere else  they weren't as good as fresh out of the oil. I will certainly be ordering from BJ's again
Jackie H.,Milpitas  CA,276,231,56,9/23/2013,4.0,1. Food: A lot like the Yard House  but it tastes better. 2. Great Pizookie selection3. Parking is a little strange in this place. It is a maze! I see it as a challenge  however I can see it as a challenge for inebriated people. 4. Oreo pizookie. 'Nuff said.It's a great chain. You get the same food at every location (which is good because their margherita flat bread is awesome). The service is a hit or miss  but the turn-over is so high (like every restaurant) that I can't really attribute service to food quality. I'd come back :)
Wintha K.,Fremont  CA,8,20,1,9/27/2014,1.0,I tried to give this place another chance but their service is appalling. Earlier this month I came here and it took 45 mins after ordering to receive our order of two salads and one small pizza. They also then forgot we placed the order for a pizookie so that took an additional 25-30 mins. We asked to speak to a manager and he came over 20 mins later  and said he was completely unaware of the situation. Gave it another chance tonight and all we ordered was the pizookie trio. 20 mins after ordering they let us know they were out of the peanut butter pizookie. How did they not figure that out earlier when we ordered? This extended our wait for just a pizookie to 30 mins after ordering and counting...still haven't received it yet. Pretty unacceptable.
Robert P.,Union City  CA,3,34,3,6/3/2015,5.0,Our server  Rhianna  was amazing. My mother ordered something that wasn't on the menu and she quickly checked with the kitchen to see if it could be made. We were never waiting for drink refills  and her cheerful attitude dramatically enhanced the meal.
Ruby K.,Lancaster  CA,0,17,9,6/30/2015,1.0,The food was bland  the service was awful and it was an overall horrible experience. This particular location is the worst BJ's location. Our server was Courtney and she had a really bad attitude and only came to our table once ( we weren't even able to get refills)
Steph C.,San Lorenzo  CA,300,395,68,11/20/2013,4.0,Not as bad as people claim it to be. The bar is the best place to sit if you're looking to get the latest and greatest in sports for the day. There are TV's everywhere! The beer selection is great and the service is fast and friendly. Although I like fast service  I always assume the food quality will be sub par. Not here! I ordered the appetizer sliders for my entree during dinner and it filled me up good. Pizooki? I'll pass. I can make a better cookie at home. If you're looking to bring your kids with you on a Thur/Fri/Sat  I'd recommend to think twice. It's loud  people are slinging back beers and it has dim lighting.Bypassing the cookie dessert  it's no wonder this place is always packed and has a line out the door.
Kavita B.,Fremont  CA,16,54,,5/31/2015,1.0,Save your money and run! When this place first opened  excellent service and the food was delicious. As time went on  this place has lost all its charm. The service is horrid and the food  just as bad. I have been here on several occasions because it always seems to have little wait these days and fits large parties. The worst is their brunch  my son ordered pancakes from their kids menu. It was literally 3 pieces of pancakes the size of a small coins. We ended up ordering a regular sized pancake afterwards.
Monica R.,Danville  CA,537,111,153,3/4/2014,4.0,I love BJ's every dish I have tried here has been pretty good and reasonable in price as well as always having great service and a fun bar crowd. Great place to watch games.
Jennifer S.,Mountain View  CA,46,98,225,2/19/2012,3.0,If this weren't one of the few places open in Fremont after 10 PM  I would never come here. In fact  the only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the lack of competition BJ's has for late-night grub.The wait for your food is always a minimum of 30 minutes  no matter how busy the restaurant is. The food tastes fine  but is also quite overpriced for what you're getting  and you're really paying for the nice ambiance and the TVs. (The service is lackluster  so you're certainly not paying for that!)I have never had beer or pizookies there  so I might just be missing out  but as it stands  I only go to BJ's under peer pressure and never on my own volition.
Janice M.,Alameda  CA,661,130,304,5/20/2013,4.0,"I\'m not the biggest fan of chain restaurants and when I mean chain restaurant  I\'m taking about Applebee\'s   TGI Fridays  Chili\'s  El Torito.. Etc. Countless of times I have driven pass this BJ\'S restaurant thinking"" Ehhhhhh... It\'s just another one of those chain restaurants  ill pass"" but when I decided to try it this week   I was kinda impressed. I\'ve never stepped into this place since they open and just now I decided to give it a try.Service:I heard it can be a hit or miss. My sis in law and I came in here around 5pm and Happy Hour is here is between 3pm-7pm and it wasn\'t that busy. I heard they get pretty packed here. (45+min waits) Our waiter was A guy named Ed and he was pretty nice and informative when it came to a lot of things in the menu. Very talkative and funny guy. Made sure our waters were filled and got us anything we needed.Food: I actually wanted to try a lot of things on the menu. What caught my eye was the Ahi Poke appetizer. It was that or the calamari but I also wanted to try the calamari so I got that instead. The ahi poke will be the reason I come back for a second visit. My sis in law kept talking about now delish their pizzas are so she ended up getting that to share with my boy. Before ordering my meal  we got munch on the calamari and I thought it was really good. Not too crunchy but not to soggy either. I decided to get a regular veggie burger. First bite... I was satisfied. Only pet peeve I have is when restaurants serve you burgers and all the insides (produce) are served on the side. Next time I think I\'ll mention for them to put together for me. The fries were great!! I love how they were thin. Very flavorful! IDecided to take a bite of the pizza crust from my sis in laws order and oh wow! Delicioso!!!! Last but not least... PAZOOKI time. I was so happy to hear they had an option for a smaller size pazooki. We were all pretty much stuffed. The ice cream served on top of that warm cookie made it a delightful treat!I can\'t wait till I get the chance to come back here and dine. I\'ve raved to a couple of people about BJs and they have all given me ideas on different things to try."
Pearl V.,San Jose  CA,1248,993,3794,6/11/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,YES on the strawberry mojitos!and DOUBLE YES on the ahi poke.They are always a MUST order when my GFs and I get together! The mojitos are dangerous... so delicious yet not lightly poured  because they sure can creep up on you if you have more than one. And the poke. If you love sashimi or are a poke lover like me... take my advice and order TWO for the table. You'll be glad you did!
Blaire A.,Union City  CA,55,113,72,3/21/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,First time I have ever come in and not gotten a pizza. They took away the cheeseburger pizza which was really disappointing  but anyway.....I ordered the California Burger and I took off the green chilis because I do not like spice. The bun is a piece of delicious garlic toast that will you have your mouth watering for more. Order the thin and crispy fries because they did not put enough on your plate to satisfy you.My boyfriend ordered the burger with bleu cheese and bacon (which was gross to me because I hate bleu cheese). He ordered it with wedges and it looked like they put a handful as this huge plate was mostly barren. I'm pretty sure this was a mistake though as I saw the next table over receive a burger and A LOT of wedges. Flavor wise I like thin and crispy a bit more than the wedges but they're close in flavor. Our waiter was Lance. He was nice. Strawberry lemonade was okay  but nothing special. I think I probably drank 4 glasses of it though so....
frank c.,Fremont  CA,2,8,,8/3/2013,1.0,This review is for our dining experience on 8/2/13:This has to be one of the most painfully slooooooow dining experience I've ever sat through! For example  we ordered the appetizer nachos and asked for the salsa on the side. Kudos to them for getting the nachos out in good time  but we didn't get the salsa until we were half way through with our nachos!  Also  the wife's strawberry lemonade refill took over 10 minutes and 2 servers to get! It felt like the server was no where to be seen  either that or he was trying to avoid us!We've been visiting BJ's ever since they opened a few years ago  but the service has gone downhill ever since. I don't think I'll ever suggest BJ's again...
Kristina N.,Milpitas  CA,72,126,142,11/21/2014,5.0,Well I've been to this BJ's for a gazillion times and last night was one of the best experiences I've ever had there. I didn't quite get our server name but she was AMAZING! Very nice  attentive and social. She's the reason why I'm giving this place 5 stars. Anyways the food here is okay  they're not bad but they're not to die for either. I always get the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wrap and the wings for appetizers  though their portions always fill me up. Their pizzas are pretty good  but the pastas are alright. Kinda just like Olive Garden  nothing special. However i'm sure everyone knows about their pizookies. They are DELICIOUS. I have had pizookies at other places but none are like BJ's. Oh god if i could I would eat like 5 a day!! Anyways i'm a fan of BJs and I most def would come back.
P A.,Hayward  CA,6,83,61,4/26/2015,2.0,The service is so slow. It usually takes 15 minutes to receive your drink order. The food used to be good  2 years ago but I notice the menu continues to change and the prices at the BJ on Mowry is more expensive than other locations and the menu does offer the half/smaller portion selections. A normal lunch on a Monday -Thursday will take 2 hours.
Ronnie G.,Hayward  CA,15,41,149,11/24/2014,1.0,I've been here twice and had a terrible experience both times. The restaurant is always under staff. Food arrives late and cold. If you don't flag down your waiter  you'll never get a refill on your drinks.
Anne E.,Union City  CA,0,19,6,5/21/2015,1.0,THEIR HAPPY HOUR IS A LIE. they give you half portions for half the price so you're basically buying it for regular price. At all the places I've been to they're the only place that does that. Also  our server was very rude and seemed annoyed when we told him we were waiting for happy hour to start.
Chrlens S.,Hayward  CA,44,13,7,7/15/2015,4.0,Met a friend here and the setting was nice it's right off the freeway... Food was good and service was good as well..
Matthew H.,San Jose  CA,57,10,1,1/9/2015,4.0,Mark one of the coolest and nicest worker at BJ! He gave me an amazing BJ experience that I will never forget! I'll come back for some more BJ from him soon. Thanks bro!
Louisa T.,Fremont  CA,182,699,266,9/30/2013,4.0,Thank youuuuu google! When we looked up BJ's on googlemaps  a coupon popped up for BJ's  $20 for 2 soup or salads  1 medium pizza and a pizookie for dessert. Can't get better than that. Amazing deal if you ask me. My husband and I ended up going with 2 other friends and we both got a chance to use the deals  thanks to our waiter checking with his boss to make sure we could. As a group we shared a pitcher of heff and original wings to start off  and I thought the wings were delicious. I would definitely come back for those wings and the pizza. The salad was limited to ceasar or house  which I was ok with. My husband ordered the chilli soup which I think he enjoyed  and we shared a medium spicy meatball pizza  and it was spicy alright. It was definitely the jalapeno type of spicy where it burns your mouth a bit. Delicious flavor however  and I like that the crust and presentation on the serving plates was like a deep dish pizza. This is a crust you can eat on it own. (medium pizza for 2 and we had left overs to take home) I haven't been here in a long time  but I do remember their scampi pasta being super delicious as well. I'll have to go back and verify that. The oh so famous pizookie... warm cookie topped with ice cream was delicious as usual  but a tad too sweet for my taste now. I think I'm getting old. But my friend ordered the red velvet (I didn't even know they had different flavors now!) and I ordered the cookies n' cream one. The cookies and cream was on a delicious (but overly sweet chocolate cookie which I normall love if it's not too sweet) topped with vanilla ice cream and cookies n' cream whip. The red velvet seemed less sweet  and tasted ok. As for the seating  when you walk in  everything to the right where the bar was is free for all  first come first serve. We went there because we really wanted to watch our football games (both Stanford and Cal had games going on  half an hour apart) and thanks to Bj's big tv splitting 4 ways  my husband and I were quite content that we were able to watch our games while enjoying our meal (we called in advance to make sure they were going to play it before arriving). The menu here is great with a wide selection of foods (and beer- their samplers are fun) you may enjoy  and I have to admit our server this Saturday by the bar section was terrific! Great service. It was definitely more enjoyable that I thought it would be.
Frank P.,Santa Clara  CA,0,6,,5/31/2013,1.0,Worst service I have ever had. Went twice. The first time we were told it would be five minutes and we kept waiting and others with the same number of people were seated before us even though they had arrive after. After 25 min  we left went somewhere else.Second time with a different friend. We were seated right away. Order a pizza and waited. Two hours later we received a raw pizza where the only thing melted was the top layer of cheese. Wish I would have taken a pic to post. We asked for the manager and she didnt bother to take anything out out of the bill. The only thing she offer was to box it so that we can bake it at home.
Delilah B.,San Francisco  CA,96,319,37,6/1/2011,3.0,Huge assortment of beers. +1Lime in the Coconut. +2Avocado rolls. +2Looooong wait  no reservations. -1Consistency. -1I went here twice in 1 week. Actually  twice in 1 weekend. Not for the ambiance  the long wait  the tiny TV's but for 2 things. The Avocado rolls and their Lime in the Coconut drink.Although the Avocado rolls were consistently and absolutely delicious and addicting  the Lime in the Coconut drink was better the first time. They had absolutely different flavors each time. :/ Too bad. Consistency is key.
Allan H.,Fremont  CA,157,203,26,7/23/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Okay I'm a bigger fan of this place now.... Although the food is still sub-standard for it's price range  the drink selection and my newfound love for a few of their specialty drinks have made up for it.Jeremiah Red: I don't need to turbo-browse these reviews to know that this is probably one of the best and favorite beers among the patrons  it's really got a full body taste and feel to it and is pretty alcoholic. A fruitier and albeit less potent drink is their ciders. I actually enjoy drinking all of their ciders when I want to switch it up from drinking Reds. Although I feel like BJ's ciders falls a bit short of Yard House  it's a good and much closer alternative. This updated rating either reflects a change in my personal preference of this place or is symbolic of my venture into alcoholism  either way  this has because a go-to spot for my friends and I.
Norman F.,Union City  CA,270,35,21,5/23/2013,1.0,1 star for decent food.Although their food is ok the service sucks!!! The last time I was here the server said stupid ass shit to us. He seemed like he was high which is cool  I don't care but we were with my girls parents.Real classyTonight our server seemed hella out of it and barely said shit to us as we were ordering. She makes eye contact with us but walks by us hella fast without saying shit. Never filled my water  never took our plates away. But you never.... Never.... Fuck with my pazookie. Servers name is ravinder k.I will not be returning.BTW this review comes from someone who works for tips and is extremely generous for actual good service.
Cyrex G.,San Leandro  CA,5,33,1,6/19/2013,1.0,"I\'ve gone 5 times now and had to give up every time because the wait was 45 minutes. Went tonight (Wednesday 8:40PM)  and we were told 25 minute wait. After awhile the host came over and apologized that she had to bump up the wait time to 45 minutes. I\'m sorry  but your excuse for a long wait shouldn\'t be ""because there\'s only one waiter for that section"". Like their food but I the service is lacking."
Jay J.,Union City  CA,1,66,,5/1/2015,2.0,Not all bad  but not all good either. The Good Server was friendly and very attentive  quick with refills and extras. Thanked us for the good tip.Rib eye steak was very tasty and very large.Horseradish mashed potatoes were good.The BadWait time 20-25 minsBrussels sprouts didn't taste good.BLT salad had a dressing on it that also did not taste good. Too mustardy maybe?Nachos were nothing special  although a large serving.Baked Beignet tasted cold and old. Too much strawberry 'sauce' rather than fresh strawberries.The server was the best part.
Angel Y.,Fremont  CA,13,53,41,10/5/2014,5.0,Delicious food every time! I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and it was absolutely delicious! My fianc ordered the jambalaya and although the portion wasn't big enough for his liking  he was quite pleased. Great service.
Viet N.,Alameda  CA,339,463,226,1/29/2012,3.0,It's a shame I was driving and that it was brunch time  or else I would have had a beer at this place. Maybe even a pizookie. Because what I had didn't exactly blow my mind.I had the great beginnings (I think?) appetizer (basically mozzarella sticks  avocado wraps  some eggroll looking thing  and chips with spinch dip)  and the California scrambled eggs. Everything was loaded with cheese  and I couldn't even finish my entree. Yes  half of the appetizer and 1/3 of the entree was enough to fill me up (I was sharing with the other person in my party of 2). It was good overall   and the sauces went very well with their respective appetizers. But throughout my meal  I kept thinking that this tastes exactly like something I would get at Fridays or Chilis. It was a little cheaper  but the food is not something I would go for on a regular basis  much like the other chain restaurants I mentioned. However  the server  Christy  was very attentive throughout our time we were there  so plus points to BJ's! However  next time I'm just coming back for a beer and a pizookie.
Kevin S.,Plano  TX,26,816,2,1/29/2012,4.0,In town to visit some family and friends  needed a place to watch the Patriots play the Ravens. Considered a local pizza place...but when I found they had 2 very small screens....we changed it up to BJ's.Timing was perfect  we arrived just after kickoff and grabbed a table in the bar.Katrina was our waitress and she was good.Ordered some nachos to start for the first half and had a medium classic combo pizza for the second half.Nachos were loaded and loaded! Very tasty! We didn't finish them  and that's not usually the case...LOTS of nachos!!The pizza? Excellent!The beer? Great! Had several Sam Adams.Parking can get tight  especially with a local game on (49ers  Giants  Sharks  etc).There is some construction going on with the old part of the mall...my guess is they are going to redo it or maybe make more parking? who knows...but it doesn't improve things for now.Why 4 stars? Just the layout of the place....didn't seem that well planned for when a crowd of people are standing in the bar area.
Lancaster K.,Union City  CA,38,29,9,9/21/2013,3.0,I've been here numerous times and the experience has been what you would expect from a place like this. It's always busy. It's even worst when there's a game. It feels like everyone in Newark is here. This is a good place to watch a game but be wary of that beer tab. If you come here often with your significant other get the rewards card and earn that free desert.Food: The food here is pretty decent. We keep it simple and order Pizza  Wings  and Calamari. This is as good as it gets. Overall this is always a great place to eat and hangout.
Anna W.,San Leandro  CA,488,569,473,6/29/2011,4.0,Of all the chain restaurants that we frequent (and we frequent many chains)  Boyfriend ranks this chain as one of his favorites. The service has always been pretty friendly and the food is pretty decent for the price that you pay. The wait staff is always willing to split the check for you  which is always appreciated  especially when there is a large group of friends.I think one of my favorite things to see is how many late high school/college-aged girls come here  dressed to the nines (think clubwear). It's really not an upscale restaurant at all; I mean  it's not McDonald's  but it's not exactly Gary Danko either. The wait for dinner here can get pretty excessive  so call ahead on your way out there and get your name on their waiting list so your wait time isn't as painful once you get there (especially on Friday/Saturday nights).Boyfriend also really loves the beer selection here. They have a wide selection on tap (from my understanding)  and they also have seasonal beers available on tap as well. Of their alcohol  I have only tried their Irish Root Beer -- which is delicious  but light (not that I can drink much anyway).One of my favorite items on their menu is their baked potato. It's HUGE  delicious  filling and cheap. What more can a starving college girl ask for? Their pizzas are also amazing  and a small or medium pizza is usually enough to share between two people (or it is for Boyfriend and I  but I also don't tend to eat a lot in general). Their nachos appetizer is also amazingly large -- we shared it among four people and still couldn't demolish it.BJ's  however  is famed for their Pizookie. It's probably one of the better desserts that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming and regretting (for  alas  I am lactose sensitive). I recommend getting the Pizookie Trio  so you can get three smaller Pizookies and try them all as opposed to just one large Pizookie. Be warned though; you'll get hooked. Giant  warm cookie topped with delicious ice cream? Be still  my artery-clogged heart (and please  please be still after  my poor upset tummy).
Christopher S.,Union City  CA,113,21,125,4/8/2012,4.0,Another local eatery that I've been to maybe a half dozen times and every time I've visited  it's been a good experience.It can get pretty craze during dinner time and the weekends so I usually shy away from this place unless it's for a birthday party  so it would be wise to call ahead of time for reservations because it can take a minute to get seated.Pretty reasonable prices for above average entrees. Their beer/cocktail selection is pretty bad ass too! Try the shrimp lettuce wraps and the fried calamari. For beers I usually go with the Brew house Blonde or Hef. The pints look a bit smaller than usual tho or maybe it's the glass?
Harsh M.,San Jose  CA,50,74,186,3/16/2015,4.0,Must try the stuffed mushrooms. BJs is always a go-to place for my group of friends as it has really great appetizers and pizza  and beer. This BJs in particular is in a nice location right off 880  for easier access for non-fremont/non-newarkians.
Lilian L.,South Bay  CA,128,513,111,12/23/2011,3.0,Went here for the first time which also happened to be the first time that my boyfriend and I had a dinner party or any type of food get together with my friends. My boyfriend and a mutual friend of ours got there at 6:38PM  the restaurant notified us that the wait would take an hour and a half.. Now an hour passed and then they said 58 minutes.. (we are a group of 10 and the table were waiting for had 30 people  but regardless a restaurant should not give times as a statement if they are unsure..)I ordered the New Orleans jambalaya. It was pretty good. My best friend didn't recommend this because when she had it  it was really oily and greasy. I found it to be fine  but a little spicy maybe for some.Also I got the Pizookie in Red Velet. It was really good  but really sweet even though I have a sweet tooth. My boyfriend on the other hand doesn't like things too sweet so it wasn't something he could even eat half of. There was a 17% tip for our group.. thought it should be only 15... but it 17.. Waiter service: didn't do much  took forever to get our bill when we were done  she made a mistake but eventually that was resolved with a wrong dish. (Every server differs  but it wasn't a crazy night for a Tuesday)Would I go here again? maybe.. but  it's not that special. My boyfriend said the burgers are like D&B burgers in case anyone was wondering.My friends said they would go back for fries  boyfriend said they were like potatoe chips. Only bad thing is they put either hella salt of MSG in their food.. I had to drink a lot of water that night  my boyfriend got up an had 3 FULL GLASSES of water. Great thing is that they do call you in case you decide to go around since buzzers don't walk further distances.Parking looked hard for some  but I manage to get a spot  it wasn't too bad. Atmposhere: not too dim.. it's okay. artwork on walls... etc.. it's like a bar/applebee's pretty much sort of.. great for maybe friends and stuff.P.S. NO COKE  only pepsi. but they have homemade rootbeer.(went on 12/20/2011)
Stephanie K.,Monterey  CA,0,8,1,11/1/2014,2.0,Food is good but they lie about the portions. My fried chicken meal was supposed to have two chicken breast but in reality they split one breast into two pieces. As a lady that gets full quickly  I cleaned my plate and was left wanting. My boyfriend was still hungry after his meal and was looking for others scraps.
Jason N.,San Leandro  CA,106,5,1,8/22/2013,3.0,My experiences here has been mixed. The food here is alright but the service seems to fluctuates. After coming in and reserving a party for 8 on a relatively busy night  we were seated an hour later in the the round  corner booth with an extra seat pulled up to seat our full party. If you can imagine  we were the literally packed like a can of sardines. I enjoy my company but I don't need to be playing footsies with every one of them. Then came our waitress who was completely apathetic to our situation. At this point  we waited too long and everyone was hungry. I usually order the Crusted Parmesan Chicken and tonight was no exception except for that they forgot my veggies. No biggy right? I can just ask for them  so I did. Our waitress brought them out and they were clearly nuked. What a bummer.I've had better experiences here but be prepared for anything less less.
Stephanie A.,Union City  CA,44,8,1,4/30/2015,2.0,The staff is pretty friendly but I give them 2 stars for service. It took 45 min for a chicken Caesar salad.
Colin T.,Fremont  CA,27,29,3,11/16/2014,2.0,For food 2 stars. Just come here for sports and you will avoid heartache and disappointment. Had the angel hair pasta and lasagna . We felt that both were just reheated and not fresh. The cheese had melted with the pasta into chunks. My pasta was supposed to be served with garlic oil. Either the oil wasn't present or it had completely soaked into the pasta (shudder). We had fond memories of this place. The food was good back then  not now.
Cat G.,San Ramon  CA,252,214,35,3/1/2011,1.0,"Saturday  February 26th  2011. We were in town for a big NCS wrestling meet. We had a break in the afternoon and decided to take all the kids to BJ\'s for lunch before finals. We arrive with a group of 18-20 people. Right away the Manager on duty said that she has a big party that will be done in about 20 minutes and we\'ll be seated no longer than 35 minutes. If it was going to be any longer than that we\'d have to go somewhere else in order to get back in time. So we stayed given that time window. 45 minutes later... Still waiting  18 people deep in the waiting area... when I asked the manager how much longer it would be  she said they were bussing our tables and we would be seated in just another 10 minutes. 15 minutes later... ""I\'m so sorry  they are just putting your tables back together  we\'ll be seating you in 5 minutes. Why don\'t I start putting in your orders now so that when you sit down the food will be ready"" Which we agreed to do.. 20 minutes later... They take us to the table. By that time. two of our pizzas were cold  one of the sandwiches had soggy bread. 8 of the kids had to go back to the school  scarfing down food  because a 35 minute wait turned into an hour and 20 minutes. Food was awful  clam chowder was runny and luke warm. We ate the food and left. Not a good experience at all  to say the least."
Priscilla F.,Fremont  CA,129,53,9,2/8/2014,3.0,Long story short: Food was okay  service was not. Went here last night with a few of my friends and our server was originally a guy named Chris. But since he was going on lunch or leaving  another server took care of us named Nayeli. She seemed nice at first but first impressions can be deceiving. She took our orders and visited the table ONCE before other servers delivered out food to the table. She hardly checked on us and didn't even refill our drinks. The wait to get our food was RIDICULOUS!!! It would've been a little better had our server checked on us a few times but she didn't. When we finally got our food  we didn't even finish because we waited so long. My friend and I split a bacon chicken ranch pizza which was pretty good  another friend ordered fettuccine Alfredo (basic) and another one ordered a margherita fresca flatbread or something like that (chewy bread).After dinner  we ordered dessert. About 15-20 minutes passed before we got our dessert and it was the wrong one and again she didn't even bring it to the table  someone else did. We told the server that our dessert was wrong so she took it back to the kitchen. About 2 minutes later  Nayeli brings out the dessert that we just rejected and said that another server took our order  the kitchen is making another one and to just eat the one she brought out again while we were waiting. Seriously? By this time my friends and I didn't care because she wasn't being the best server anyway  plus a free pizookie is a win for anyone. I don't know if it was because it was Friday or whatever but service was pretty bad. Waited forever to get our food and they couldn't get our dessert right. I enjoy going to BJ's but it really depends on the server you get. It might be awhile until I visit this BJ's again.. This is the third time I've received bad service there. It might be bad luck with the servers or the nights that I happen to go  either way 3 stars is all you get BJ's.
Joy H.,Milpitas  CA,20,3,7,3/29/2014,4.0,I'd only been to a BJ's one time before  and it was pretty good. So when the hunnie suggested we try the one in Newark  I was game. We have driven past it many times  and every time it was packed. But we went at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon and got a table immediately.The decor of the restaurant was awesome. The bar looked nice and we'll stocked. The place was clean. Overall appearance was great. Service...meh. We were seated and it took about 10 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink order. It wouldn't have been too bad if the place was busy  but it wasn't. We ended up placing our orders...we got the fried calamari  he ordered the Bbq pulled pork sandwich with their crispy fries  and I ordered the new roast beef dip with wedged fries. The calamari breaded and deep fried and served with a lemony tartar-like sauce and a spicy marinara sauce. It was good  crispy  but a little oily. They could have drained it a bit more. His pulled pork was pretty good. The pork was tender and the flavor was intense. The coleslaw that came with it was warm  and I didn't like that. The fries  well  they were fries. My dip...it was awesome! The roll was toasted. There was a good amount of beef on the sandwich. The Swiss cheese was perfectly melted. The au jus had a lot of flavor. The wedged fries seemed to have a coating on them and were fried crispy  which I liked. The meal itself I give 4 stars.Then came dessert. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia pizookie. It came out within 5 minutes and looked amazing. It was served with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. We dig in and it was delicious! It could have been cooked a tad bit longer  I think  but the flavor was just yum. We finished that fast.When we left  the place was crowded  and it wasn't even 5:00 yet! Definitely go early if you want a table. We will.
Karen T.,Carlsbad  CA,0,1,,1/31/2016,1.0,Poor service. Forgot to bring the salad before the jambalaya. Asked for no rice and yet it appeared under the jambalaya. Switched servers after ordering due to a server leaving their shift which we appreciated. However not one server came back to see what we thought of the meal. Over spiced jambalaya as well. Poor parking too  with the need to circle the parking place several times. Second time we have had this level of service and won't return now.
Lillian K.,El Cerrito  CA,0,11,,9/1/2013,2.0,Service was acceptable  seated very quickly  both servers we had (one going on break) were attentive and pleasant. But the food I had was ridiculously disappointing.I ordered a 'make your own' deep dish pizza. The crust  admittedly  was quite tasty and in line with what I expected  but the toppings/final execution and taste was just - lame. Greasy cheese  flavorless tomatoes  dry tiny meatballs  no taste of garlic except in one bite even though ordered it with roasted garlic. It was the equivalent sadly of a microwaveable 2-minute frozen pizza in taste as far as the toppings go. Not in any way worth the cost.Also  for evening/night time dining  the interior is ludicrously dark and poorly lit. Very poor showing overall.
Evelina C.,Santa Monica  Los Angeles  CA,377,398,365,11/22/2011,4.0,Came here for dessert for my sisters birthday dinner. We ordered 2 different Pazookis  one that was half red velvet & half cookies & cream and one that was half double chocolate chip & regular chocolate chip. They were absolutely delicious  but it took forever for the second Pazooki to come out.
Sasha M.,Fremont  CA,0,31,6,8/15/2013,5.0,"Only bad thing was when I came here once and was waiting to be seated. A girl said she\'d call me shortly. However later she just kept starring at me instead of calling me to let me now our table was ready. When I went upto after a while of her glancing at me here and there she says ""yea...your table is ready"" ...What the heck? lol whatever.The food also takes FOREVER to arrive when it\'s packed but I do see many waiters walking around and I understand why it would take a while with how many people are there on packed nights.ANYWAYS  I give this 5 stars because the food is always DELICIOUS. The waiters have always been so polite. Once my friends foods arrived before mine and the manager came out apologizing and said I can have any appetizer for free so I could eat with my friends. The food came in right away after the manager came out. I thought that was great customer service. and omg their PIZOOKIs (did i spell that right?) are SOOOO DELICIOUS! YUM. I get the smaller size than the regular ones because it\'s too chocolatey.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Especially at night to go on a date  friends night out  or even a family day out! The atmosphere at night is kinda dark. I like that though lol."
Jim D.,Oakland  CA,585,695,405,1/3/2011,3.0,Great place to watch college football. I met with three buddies to watch the Stanford vs Virginia Tech game at BJ's BJ's had beer specials where the beer pints are half off the regular prices. Three of us had beers while one of the buddies was drinking wine (who watches football and drinks wine). We also ordered the platter with the avocado rolls  taquitos  mozzarella sticks with chip and nachos. I thought the platter was really tasty plus they had special pricing. The avocado rolls with the cream cheese are the best. After a couple beers we had a second wind for eating so we order three of the mini pizzas one combination  one margherita and one bacon/cheeseburger. I didn't taste the bacon/cheeseburger but I did taste the two others. Both were very good and the crust was light and fluffy  similar to a croissant.Friendly service and the servers are on the spot when you need a refill....
Linda D.,San Jose  CA,1184,448,1494,1/10/2012,4.0,An hour wait on a Friday night? Geezus squeezes. Super packed. The calamari appetizer was super crispy n good. I got the tomato salad. It had slices of tomatoes with fresh mozzarella balls and Parmesan in balsamic vinaigrette. Super tasty. I ordered a small pizza half great white shark  and bjs combo for my nephew. It was ok I expected deep dish pizzas to be loaded with more marinara  cheese  and toppings though ha. Just from what I've seen on TV  but it was just alright. I had some of my moms salmon it was good. And mashes potatoes? Hella good! My sister ordered a steak medium rare and it looked like black dookey  burnt  overcooked and chewy. So maybe avoid the steaks or get em medium rare. Awesome to bring kids for the kids menu. It's like 5 bucks n my nephew got a pretty big plate of spaghetti  side of mashed potatoes  and a drink. My waiter was also very friendly.
Mike L.,Fremont  CA,0,32,7,6/4/2015,2.0,Wow 15 minute wait and 20 tables open? Terrible service  long wait  tiny parking lot but not their fault  ridiculous that you can't be seated because of lack of staff. More people in the bar than the restaurant and less staff but people are seated and eating.
Angela K.,San Lorenzo  CA,295,673,1071,1/8/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,On your birthday  you will receive a COMPLIMENTARY PIZOOKIE DESSERT  This coupon expires in 2 weeks.
Erin W.,Cape Elizabeth  ME,88,29,11,4/15/2013,4.0,"So  in a slight variation on the Valentine\'s Day tradition my wife said ""Well  you can get a steak  at BJs."" We ended up doing other things that night and never made it out there. So  when the in-laws popped in over the weekend and asked if there was anyplace we wanted to try for dinner  we decided it was time to try BJs out.Our party was seated quickly on a busy night and our server popped in for drinks right away. I wanted to get food ordered for the boy first thing and our server was happy to accomodate. I write that  because many servers out there develop severe brain freeze when I try to order food before the drinks. She saw the logic and made it happen.Wifey loved her sesame salad  In-laws liked their food  turkey burger and shrimp & lettuce wraps. I prolly was the least pleased of the bunch food-wise. I ordered a burger with bacon and cheddar  thinkin it would be a safe bet. Safe  sure. Great  not so much.The burger looked formidable at first glance  but was found out to be a thin pattied wimp. There was about 3 inches of lettuce and several tomatoes hiding about a half inch of burger and 2 anemic bacon slices beneath. It tasted fine  but I will pick something else from their extensive menu next time.There will be a next time. The service was great start-to-finish and the space is more of a loud restaurant with a few TVs than it is a sports\' bar so it seems well suited for families."
Henna P.,Fremont  CA,98,281,214,11/7/2011,4.0,This place is right by my work and has become the default Happy Hour watering hole on Fridays. I think their drinks are over priced  but the cocktails are yummy :9 The portions are a good size so I always end up with leftovers to take home. I recently shared a large Portabello Mushroom pizza with 2 other people and we each ended up with an extra slice to take home. It was very tasty!I hate the parking lot. It's the most poorly designed parking lot ever. Seriously. Whatever moron designed it needs to go back to parking lot design school. The layout is terrible  there are weird bumps and dips all over the place  the spots are different sizes  and it's just like a really bad maze because there's no flow to the design. It probably doesn't help that Mervyn's went out of business and there's nothing else open in that plaza. But at least you don't have to fight for parking spots with retail shoppers.
Kenneth L.,Fremont  CA,23,32,9,2/16/2015,3.0,This would be a 3.5 stars review if possible. My friends and I went to watch the NBA All-Star game there. We sat at the bar tables and had the carnitas fries with chile verde as well as a large BJ's favorite pizza. The ambiance is nice. It's definitely a nice place to watch games with friend. The massive tv at the bar area makes watching sports pretty great. The waitstaff is nice but generally very busy. This means that they'll take awhile to come back to you and ask you if you need refills or are ready to order. That's really because BJ's always seems to have a fairly long wait (the bar area less so than the restaurant section). All in all  this place fits the criteria of a nice place to watch a game.The food and drinks are what you expect of BJ's. Decent food but fairly pricey. The carnitas fries were good  a little bit too much salt in there though. The carnitas were tender and the chile verde complimented the fries and carnitas well. This was probably my favorite thing I had there that night. The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was pretty good as well. Not the most amazing deep dish pizza I've ever had but definitely a good pizza. It had a little of everything (sausage  pepperoni  bell peppers  olives) and the flavors blended well (obviously  because its essentially a combo pizza). The crust was quite addicting (I'm not a crust guy either) as the dough was crispy on the outside while still maintaining that nice chew in the middle. Again  this was pretty salty  so if you don't like salty foods you should probably stay away from this place. For my drink I had the root beer (because I wanted refills.....we were there for about 3 hours). I was tempted by some of the alcoholic drinks but ended up getting the root beer instead. I'll probably come back to try some of their alcoholic drinks. As for the root beer it was definitely one of the best root beer I've ever had. They come in a frosted mug (essential because it keeps the root beer cold while not diluting it with ice) and unlimited refills (I had about 5 rounds of root beer). All in all  I spent about $17 (including tax and tip) for this meal. Not horrible because of what I went there for (decent food  drinks  and watching the all-star game with friends) but definitely not cheap. I would definitely come back once in awhile to watch some sports with my friends but probably not regularly or even semi-regularly. My PSA for this place would be that I did slip into a salt-induced food coma after getting home. Be forewarned.
Prashanth S.,Central District  Fremont  CA,102,10,8,3/15/2015,4.0,Good for a very late night dinner in Newark. As with all BJ'S you won't be disappointed. But parking is a spot of bother
Joe B.,Hayward  CA,16,10,2,5/31/2015,5.0,I'm a regular here... And usually I get treated really well. U can call ahead and reserve a spot..food deserves 5 stars...sometimes it can take a while but hey that's fine because the more time you spend with the family the better... Thank you bjs for keeping it real.
John H.,Fremont  CA,1,55,1,1/21/2015,3.0,"Was tempted to give this a 2-star. Bar\'s the place to be; comfortable and the tenders are usually gregarious and efficient. Beer\'s acceptable  but the food is Dennys++. Pizza rates a ""nice try"". The fun pluses in this place are the black cherry and cream sodas  both ostensibly house-made."
Justin L.,Concord  CA,0,36,11,3/10/2015,3.0,Food was great  but server was very slow to come to table and great us  to take our order  and for food delivery. Also my wife's plate was missing some food. Went on a Tuesday wasn't that busy you would expect them to be fast but just wasn't the case today.
James H.,Fremont  CA,32,36,7,5/26/2015,5.0,I'm a regular here. I live in fremont.. There are lots of bad reviews about the service here. But that's not always the case... Yes I have had some experiences where the service was not soo perfect  but for the most part they do a pretty good job. I give them 5 stars for the good quality.... I've always had a great dinner here. Buffalo chicken  spaghetti or steak... They make it really good... I'm never disappointed... I've been coming here since 2 years and will continue to do so.... Great job bjs
Jill J.,Sunnyvale  CA,17,81,3,12/28/2014,3.0,As with most of the reviews here  service is very slow. My boyfriend and I were not in a hurry and had a few drinks. Our server would not let us order happy hour with her so we had to order at bar and bring them over ... Meh. In addition there was a mistake with our pizza  appreciated that she admitted it was her fault as most servers would not:) . However the food runner ( who looked like the most unhappiest person in the world) brought us the wrong pizza on accident ... And the other food did taste like it had been sitting for a while. Our server was really sweet but the food runner did not smile and said nothing when she delivered our food  we had to yell to ask her for ketchup. Well we were offered the mistake pizza for free since we touched it and a free pizZookie. Maybe not our first choice for food but it was decent if you have lots and lots of time ;)
Elaine Y.,Fremont  CA,32,504,5,12/5/2014,2.0,typical chain sports bar restaurant with big tvs and lots of people. was i expecting something different? not really i guess. had a salad that actually needed more lettuce. it was full of other things like meat but it needed more veggies and it needed to be colder. warm salad not good. the tacos were good except the plates came out sticky. it's not fun to eat something with your hands but when you touch the plate it's sticky.anyway  if you want a chain place then go.
Susan P.,Alameda  CA,12,20,35,3/1/2014,3.0,A long wait of half an hour to be seated for such a small portion of crowd. Tortilla soup is salty and the turkey sandwich. Won't be back for awhile. We have a nice waitress comes in to check on us every 10 min.
Russell T.,Orange  CA,62,8,1,4/25/2015,2.0,Parking sucks but what evs. A whopping 6 TV screens running. Plates already have sauce on them before they hit your table. Calamari has zero flavor. However  staff is very friendly and accommodating. Service on its own would earn 5 stars.
Karm P.,Fremont  CA,87,19,37,6/10/2014,3.0,3 stars cuz last time i was here i did not see the Jambalaya on the menu anymore hmmmmmm......other than that avocado egg rolls and the Buffalo ranch pizza......not much of a beer drinker but if u are You must come check this place out got a lot of beeeaa choices haha ......on that note Cheers Mate.
Kris J.,Concord  CA,40,247,153,9/17/2013,4.0,Came here on Sunday during the 49ers game. It was packed! but we got seated within 5 mins because I was on the call ahead list. Food came quick because I ordered to-go. so almost as soon as we got seated  our appetizers and pizza came out. YAY! They have happy hour at the bar section as long as the game is on  double YAY! and the whole restaurant cheers when the 49ers make a good play. they cheer REALLY REALLY LOUD. lol. Good place to watch the game!
Janel P.,Hayward  CA,6,33,3,3/19/2013,4.0,Absolutely love the Atlantic Salmon dish....wasn't expecting the quality of food from a chain restaurant that has its own brewery going  but gotta give credit when credit is due!! Much superior quality than other chain restaurants.Variety of beer and sampler drinks available is simply awesome  can keep coming back  too bad they have an hour or longer wait during peak times.... that's the only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars. They need to open one in Hayward  CA.
Derek B.,Fremont  CA,1,21,5,7/15/2014,4.0,Was looking to try this location near our new home and once we were finally accepted after trying once or twice  found it's not half bad!PROS:-Expansive menu with great food options  something akin to Elephant Bar.-Pricing is fairly decent  there are definitely ways to save money if you make good choices.-Nice atmosphere  kind of like a younger and trendier PF Changs or Elephant Bar.CONS:-Busy  busy  busy. We've walked up to this place on more than one occasion and we're told there was a 1-1.5 hr wait  wow! You're not allowed to call in ahead of time to get a reservation either  perhaps after a certain time maybe.-Given that it's busy  the waiters attention can be seriously compromised. Our waiter had issues coming regularly or when needed and would sometimes walk away before an order or request was fully resolved  strange!-It's a fairly loud atmosphere  especially around the bar area. Sort of a great place to go if you want to have more than a few drinks  talk loud  watch the game  and be merry...just be wary if you're thinking to bring certain people.-My spoon or fork was super dirty with a huge chunk of something on it...something nasty but I forget what it was...we told them but there was no consideration given...we even had to bug them b/c they forgot to replace.So yeah  the customer service CAN be lacking although more visits are needed to resolve an opinion. Hoping to try again soon.
Marcos G.,Hayward  CA,7,2,1,2/9/2016,5.0,The welcoming desk invited us kindly and with a bright mood. The waiters that assisted us were friendly and very flexible (as in they did what ever we asked). The presentation of the food was excellent and a work of art. The taste was even better than presentation with various flavors overwhelmed my tongue in the best way possible. With a hint of spice  my guacamole-bacon hamburger was built to perfection. My meal never fell apart when I lifted and bit it. For desert we got the trio. In the trio  we got the salted caramel  triple chocolate  and original. The Salted Caramel was my favorite for its flavor enhancing ingredients. The triple chocolate suppressed my chocolate craving from the whole week. The original was a sweet taste of the past  having a sweet  warm cookie under a nice cold vanilla ice cream warmed my coldest memories. With all these incredible perks overrun the fact that a pepper shaker loosened up and spilled a mountain on my siblings Parmesan Chicken. Overall it was a pleasant and fulfilling experience and will recommend to anyone who asks to have a relaxed evening and great food.
Evelyn R.,San Jose  CA,130,210,20,5/28/2014,4.0,Good food and service. We tried some pizza  chicken wings  avocado rolls  and artichoke dip...all very good. Especially the chicken wings. I also tried the scallops but they were gross. I sent them back and had it taken off my bill. The pizookies were very good as well. I tried the macadamia and oreo pizookie but the oreo was better. This Bjs location is nice and clean. I would go again.
K S.,San Jose  CA,3,227,4,12/4/2014,4.0,Pretty cool place to hang out and have a beer or 2 with friends. Usually super packed though and has long wait time. Food is pretty unhealthy  but tasty.
Brenda N.,Fresno  CA,48,41,17,11/16/2012,3.0,I came here with my sister a few weeks back and wasn't really wow'd about the place.   We sat at the bar and the counter was a sticky wet mess. I had to use my dinner napkin to wipe it down a little. Eh. . .Anyhow  I came for the happy hour appetizers while my sister ordered happy hour drinks. The finger-food items were ok . . . I'm thinking the sticky counter ruined my experience. However  the bartender was pretty good with getting my sister her drinks within a timely manner so no complaints there. I read from a previous post that BJ's makes their own sodas too. Hmm  now I might be back for that. Awesome.
Jenny T.,London  United Kingdom,243,260,665,3/27/2011,3.0,This is one of my favorite late-night suburban hangouts when I'm catching up with friends. They have an excellent happy hour menu - mini pizzas  mac & cheese  crispy calamari and chicken pot stickers - and happy hour is available late in the evening. It's always fun to sit at the bar  watch the game  chat with the bartenders and get served IMMEDIATELY.
Thuyvi M.,Hayward  CA,709,848,627,2/9/2013,4.0,Came here on a Friday night told it was going to be a 40 minute wait for 2 but within 15 minutes we got a table. Service and food was on point. Our server made my 1st time experience a good one. Very attentative and informative. We ordered way too much food since our eyes were hungry. We got 2 appetizers 2 entrees and drinks! I must say the calamari was really good and not tough and rubbery. For my entree I got the chicken parm. and it was really hot and good. The chicken didnt taste processed and the mashed potatoes were fluffy and perfect. Overall my experience was really good but I have to knock off one star for price. Our bill was $128 not including tip just for two people but I guess it was worth it :)
Artemis X.,Santa Clara  Hayward  CA,10,119,66,10/14/2013,2.0,"We came here to redeem a Google Offer for a three course meal for $20.00I am not a fan of ordering pizzas with ""1/2 this and 1/2 that"" as it seems to cause confusion. In this case  it seemed clear that April  our server  had a clear understanding of our order yet  the kitchen did not.  It took an unreasonable amount of time to receive our drinks and when April did reappear  she apologized  saying that she had to explain our order to the kitchen. I was exasperated  as I didn\'t understand the explanation requiring an absence of that length. April went to lunch  introducing us to Lori(Ann). The pizza we received looked hearty and appetizing  yet it wasn\'t how we\'d requested it  so we sent it back. The manager brought the second one which STILL wasn\'t accurate  so we sent that back for as much of a remedy as was available at the time. In the meantime  we\'d stopped here because we were hungry and pretty much an hour passed before we received our entree. We were offered an additional pizookie at no cost for the mistake.In the end  I don\'t plan on going back here. If you do  please request Lori(Ann) because I experienced her as a true service professional. Of all the persons involved  she showed heart  she was genuine.  The manager was involved  but it was one of those things where she is stepping into a mess she didn\'t make and trying to correct it as much as she can. April...well I appreciate that she understood what we wanted  and after the fact apologized for our experience."
Kathryn K.,Stockton  CA,17,11,1,4/1/2015,5.0,This is my favorite Resturant in Newark! Love the Santa Fe rolls & the s'mores pizookie the best! Tonight I ordered the pizookie for take out & they accidentally gave me the wrong order but when I called them up the guy who took my order  Eric  was very helpful and polite. He fixed the problem in no time and as always  I was very happy with my service and my order!
Krista T.,Sunnyvale  CA,1,3,,1/31/2015,1.0,Wow. So disappointed today in the service and management. Female manager Dedra?We ordered food for my husband and I and our 2 year old. Toddler food arrived. Ours never did - and they tried to charge us the $6.00 for the toddler's food. When I approached the manager she was unapologetic and said oh I can take the $6 bill. Really? Nothing else. Not even a sincere apology. I never write poor reviews or contact corporate but tonight doing both. If management actually makes it right I would edit this review. We will see if anyone responds.
JOHN S.,San Leandro  CA,2,19,,1/31/2015,3.0,I called first to put my name on the waiting list and when I arrived it was a 5min. Wait time for a table (not bad). I had the New Orleans Jambalaya which was good but bland  and a little to much Red Pepper Seasoning for my taste. The salad had tasted great can't think of the name of it but it had rasberry vinegette. The restaurant is open til 12am and the bar til 1am.
Elizabeth C.,Union City  CA,109,112,57,10/3/2013,4.0,BJs has great beer and great food. I mean what else can you ask for? Sometimes the service can be a bit slow  but I see the servers bustling around so I think it's more of a workload issue than a speed issue.Their Jeremiah Red is one of the best Red Beers around  but when it's Oktoberfest time I get even more excited. Their pizzas range from the classic to the creative and are cooked Chicago style  although they're recently added flatbreads  thin crusts  and even gluten free! A note - pizzas tend to take a little while to make...especially ones in pans so be patient!Their pizookies are so delicious  from the classic chocolate chip to the seasonal ones like rasberry white chocolate almond. A FRESH baked cookie  warm and topped with ice cream...YUM!When they have the 2 for $20  I always try and go - two salads or soups  one medium pizza  and a pizookie to share - it's perfect!
Kevin W.,Euless  TX,666,559,454,12/21/2012,5.0,I love this place. This place has TVs for all the games. It has a great drink selection  beer  non alcoholi  and mixed. They have hand crafted beverages. All the food was great. I was unimpressed by the pizookies but they were tasty also. Go check this place out. The avacado eggrolls and pizzas are excellent. They have great happy hour specials.
Abhishek S.,Fremont  CA,28,8,,12/31/2014,5.0,Ahhh!! what should I tell about this place  Awesome food  awesome Beers  nice place to enjoy with friends and family.
Tony U.,Oakland  CA,291,872,596,7/30/2011,3.0,Nice sports bar like environment. Excellent appetizers (especially the avocado roll and stuffed mushrooms). The Fish Tacos were nasty. Although I had a great time  how could an establishment muck up on fish tacos?It was the shell  it had to have been stale or overfried making the shell texture not pleasurable.Also  the calories of the food: ridiculous. Still fun place despite my few gripes. Service very good too.
Venkata W.,Union City  CA,0,8,,7/11/2014,2.0,This was the first time I went to BJs in Newark. When we waked in  there was a young group of hostesses hanging around the front of the restaurant carrying on multiple conversations. I did not understand why there were so many congregating and crowding the front of the restaurant.We were seated in the 20 min wait time. But when we went to our table  it was not wipes clean from the previous seating. When we pointed that out to our server  another young girl  she went up to the congregation and yelled at them. They just watched her disinterestedly. Then she came back  said she was sorry  that there were no silverware and napkins for us to use  and went to find them.She did not try to clean the table  or send anyone to do this. The congregation was back to just that....their conversations. Later  she returned with the napkins and silverware  after the appetizer had arrived and our hands were dripping with the sauces.When I ordered my glass of wine  which came in a carafe  she poured it for me. The problem? She did not pour all of it. In fact  she gave me a awkward smile  and took the last remaining bit with her! What gives?The main course  when it came out was warm  but nothing great. The flavors did not stand out. It was mediocre.We normally tip generously  so that did not happen here. Needless to say  we won't be returning.
Cliff G.,Fremont  CA,0,12,1,1/26/2015,4.0,We go here quite a lot  It's one of the few places open this late. I like it  and so do others  as it is always full. The tomato bisque is great  especially paired with Jeremiah red. We like the thick pizza's  love those burned parts next to the pan. Mediterranean is a good choice Watermelon/Feta salad  for something very light. Drake's Denogginizer  best beer.Only complaint is sometimes the service is a little slow  the servers probably have too many tables each.KJ index: 34.25 (KJ Chardonnay was $34.25 last time I checked).
Lynn C.,Paris  France,126,1044,610,10/25/2010,4.0,The drinks are TOO sweet but everything else was excellent.Went to BJ's for happy hour. Had to wait in the bar to get seats so we had the $1 off cocktails and a Poke for appetizer. The poke was AMAZING!! it's not served in a glass but comes with these delicious garlicky chips. For entree  I got the new orleans jambalaya. It was SPICY  not authentic  but still tasty. Loved the atmosphere and our bartender. Our server seemed like he was high  and kept bothering us about the cheque. Not cool.
Steph C.,Newark  CA,0,8,6,1/29/2016,2.0,Okay  so I'm not the type to complain. But this really bothered me. BJs is my favorite restaurant. I come here a lot i think  and sometimes the service is not the best but I never really care because the food is bomb! Yesterday i ordered my first deep dish pizza! i got a mini. Our waitress was really nice! She was a filipina girl I think? (sorry if I'm wrong) and she had some bomb ass lashes on lol. But that's besides the point. lol..anyways I get my pizza and bite into it. Literally  first bite. I look down as i'm chewing and see a huge black hair on my white scarf. i'm like what the hell (I have medium brown hair) and i start to pull it off my scarf and i feel it tugging in my mouth! YES! a hair was cooked into my pizza. I was so grossed out lol. I tried my best to be nice about the situation because I hate rude people. I told our waitress that I felt bad but i was grossed out. She took my pizza and got me a new one really fast! which was awesome but I kind of lost my appetite at this point :( they only discounted the pizza and charged me for everything else which is why i'm writing this review. Really bjs? could of atleast just took my drink and pizookie off too -__- whatever. I'll be back again probably but i'm not gonna be coming as often. Shout out the waitress though she was nice  wish i got her name to give her some credit!
Ravi C.,Austin  TX,53,277,16,9/18/2013,3.0,Don't see a point in writing a detailed review for a chain restaurant... but here we go...It almost feels blasphemous eating at a chain in the bay area given the options we have here. We stumbled to this place after laughing mad at the made up theater and at that late hour  starving we were in no mood to search. So  we came here. (gee!! I sound so apologetic!!)For Drinks we ordered IPA(liked it)  a Mohito  a Long Island(no one offered me a taste) and for the teetotaler a cream soda( tasted it and it was wonderful). We ordered the Avocado rolls and Mushroom bites(Don't remember what it's called) and they were good. Only down side is the sauce that comes with Avocado rolls. It's too sweet and I don't think it goes well with the rolls. Instead I asked for Cholula hot sauce which I think is perfect match.We ordered a large Vegetarian Pizza for main course and finished it real fast. I am very prejudicial when it comes to Pizza. The only Pizza I like is NY style pizza with very few toppings. So  when everyone wanted to order Pizza... I said yes but was very cynical about it. But for once... they were right and I was wrong. The Pizza was amazing  not NY style but the crust was fluffy and the flavors were subtle. After devouring the Pizza we ordered a Pizokie trio with Red velvett  white chocolate Macadamia and cookies and cream. They were okay... but next time  I am going to order only the single flavor version. I think because of the tininess of the cookies  they were not soft and chewy anymore. The service was great and the food was enjoyable. Definitely a place to go to have some good food and good drinks late at night.
Michelle O.,Emeryville  CA,11,26,3,11/15/2014,2.0,Just had dinner at this place. My stomach is aching! I had the parmesan crusted chicken. Flavor wasnt that great. The lighting was poor  very dim making my entire dinner party squint just to read all of the tiny writing on the menu. Not to menton for a party of 3  the wait was over 30min. The menu is plentiful with selections  but I am in no rush to return
Troy S.,San Leandro  CA,0,2,,3/20/2015,1.0,Called ahead of time to reserve a table  we get there and my name isn't on the list! How high are they? definitely not going back  hope the place burns to the ground :)
Dora C.,Fremont  CA,766,227,35,9/17/2012,2.0,Every time I walk into BJ's I feel like the hostesses are very reluctant. It always seems like they notice you right when you walk in  but then react only 2 mins later. Quite frankly  it makes me feel pretty awkward  because I'm just standing there looking at them while they look at me. However  once they acknowledge you  they are usually pretty quick with seating! Normally at these types of restaurants  I always get pasta  but for some reason BJ's pasta isn't very good! I'm not the only one who thinks so  because all my friends agree with me as well. I recommend their burgers  I got the bacon cheeseburger the last time I went. All the burgers come with a side of fries. I was extremely satisfied with the burger I got. Their meet is USDA  and it's just really juicy and big! As for pizookies  if you want to just eat one by yourself then I recommend the mini ones. I recommend the peanut butter and cookies and cream one. My friend also said that the red velvet pizookie is really good! The one that I don't recommend is the chocolate one [triple something?]  it's waaaaaaay too sweet! But yes  normally people come to BJ's for the pizookies  so definitely order one to just try!So the reason why I give this BJ's 2 stars is because of a particular experience I had once about a year ago. I came with my friends [5 girls]  and being in high school  we don't have that much money! Anyways at the end of our meal  we all split the bill and paid in a lot of fives and ones  but one of my friends paid in quarters! Since it was a lot of quarters  we decided to make the waitress's job easier by putting them in piles of four  however  when our waitress saw the money  she was super pissed off  and demanded one of our parents [who wasn't even dining and only there to pick up my friend] to take all the quarters back and give her bills. I thought this was super rude of the waitress  and I mean money is money  does it matter if it's coins or bills?In conclusion  I honestly feel like BJ's is only worth going to if you're craving pizookies.
Dilip M.,Milpitas  CA,0,22,6,1/20/2014,4.0,We came here for the niners and Seahawks game. Our friends had reserved the table so finding seating wasn't a hassle at all. Food on the other hand was average. If you go during the happy hour esp during the game  make sure to order from the happy hour menu at the bar if you are looking for happy hour deals. Otherwise you will be charged full price  which we realized later. Servers were very friendly but just overworked due to the game. Food is slightly on the expensive side. You end up paying 10 bucks for tiny boneless wings. Same with other appetizers.
MaryAnn W.,San Diego  CA,98,177,49,11/26/2013,5.0,We waited about 45mins for a table for 11 people. I would image because the 49er game was on so it was okay.Anyways we got seated and half our party was about 15mins late and our server didn't mind. Our server was Jonathan. He was so awesome. I mean he serve the table by himself plus a little help when bring out the food  but that's with all servers. The reason I give Jonathan a high five for his great servers is because 11 people we got everything we needed. He did it with a smile and never forgot any extra. He made sure our water was filled and if we needed anything else. Its a plus to me with my water especially when I went through 3 glasses and I never once had to ask him to fill it  he did it on his own.Our food came out within 20 mins which was no bigger because we were with family and friends for a birthday. The don't even add gratuity to the receipt with big groups which is a plus but we ended up tipping about 25%.
Mari P.,Fremont  CA,20,199,50,9/4/2012,1.0,Went in for lunch  granted we got a booth right away...our waitress was horrible. The waiter next to our booth saw that we had been waiting for awhile and went and checked on our drinks  found our waitress. He was super friendly and helpful. This girl took our order with the grumpiest face. Food came back with the wrong sides but we said screw it and ate it because we were hungry and had to leave. Took forever to get our check so again the waiter next door  saw us waiting and ended getting our check for us. Some people just can't be in this biz  after reading some reviews...they need a floor manager walking around checking in with tables  I would have surely called her out. And her tip reflected the service we received =)
Marshall M.,Sunnyvale  CA,3,75,,12/26/2015,1.0,Maybe they have great burgers? Maybe their beer is to die for? Who knows. We just wanted some pizza. Their menu said they have deep dish  so bring it on! It was awful. Your taste buds will be begging you for Little Ceaser's after you try eating this tasteless pizza  with uneven toppings  and practically no sauce. This is the worst pizza I've ever had. It was just horrendous.
Jerry Y.,Fremont  CA,6,21,,9/23/2012,2.0,BJ's Is ConsistentThis is the 4th BJ's I've visited  and all of them are consistent. They all have slow service and screw up food orders.Pros:+ The restaurant is clean.Cons:- Hostesses did not acknowledge our presence upon entering the restaurant  although business is slow and we were the only ones at the entrance.- Waitress did not refill my soda.- Our two entrees took 30 minutes to arrive.- The bill took 15 minutes to arrive. - My wife's salad contained cheese  although she requested no cheese. It appears the chef attempted to scrape out the cheese before serving it. Good thing she's not allergic to cheese.- Food is overpriced relative to the quality and quantity.
Kurt M.,San Francisco  CA,134,11,6,9/3/2014,5.0,Sergio is awesome!!!!! I forgot my bj reward card and he was able to look me up by number!!! Also he was very fun  friendly  and entertaining! My food was hot and very delicious!! And beer was good and refreshing!
Aaron W.,Folsom  CA,5,18,1,1/12/2015,4.0,Pretty good beer and the food is always good.  Both the burgers and the deep dish pizzas are good.  But of course the pizookies are well worth the visit.
SG G.,Jacksonville  FL,0,2,,2/3/2016,5.0,Good food  especially the pizza! Tried it once   and I am hooked. :)
Louisa L.,Castro Valley  CA,153,315,229,6/30/2011,3.0,Try to avoid coming here with a big group of people.....because you won't get your food until you are hungry to death....Food is just average  service is alright......but with the wait for food.....IT TAKES FOREVER! Even the bill took like 15 mins to come.....zzzZZzzzZZzzzz....I like how rich their clam chowder is  but at the same time it's really salty. I've tried it a few times and most of the times it's very salty. Appetizers are usually nice. Lunch menu is just so-so. My co-worker voted their fish taco to be the best  may be i should give it a try next time!
Jen I.,Markham  Canada,120,229,27,6/29/2013,3.0,I'd heard about the slow service here and was a little hesitant to try this place out  but I'm glad we did. Yes  the service was a tad on the slow side  but the hosts and servers were very polite and attentive so I don't have much to complain about.We got a bunch of appetizers  all were great. We got the calamari  avocado spring rolls (yummy!)  stuffed mushrooms  and some chorizo thing that I didn't try although the others at my table liked it.For dinner I got the Chicken Fried Steak with white cheddar mashed potatoes...I LOVE chicken fried steak but there wasn't enough of the white gravy  and sadly the steak was a little stringy. I still enjoyed the meal  since luckily they give you a LOT of food so I just cut around the crappy parts. The mashed potatoes were really good  but the veggies they serve were bland and plain. I was way too full to even think about dessert! They had a nice (but typical) selection of them from the menu. The prices were fantastic - for our group of 5 that ordered apps  entrees  and beer  it was $130. Not too shabby!PS. I kept giggling at the name the whole time I was there. BJ's. Tee hee.
Chris O.,Portland  OR,585,1668,258,6/25/2013,4.0,I think people are being a little harsh on this place. The food is exactly what I expected for a brewhouse style place and the lunch specials were fairly cheap. The beer was good and the service great as well. I enjoyed it.
Angela C.,San Francisco  CA,27,108,37,8/8/2013,4.0,"This review is for MAX- the server. He was so great! I\'m not going to get into the detail of the menu or drinks because I figure everyone has been to a BJs.Hopefully the management at this location review yelp! and give kudos to Max. He was one of the best servers I have ever had wait on me...ever. Such a sweet guy  pretty talky when we put our orders in but once we got our food he didn\'t bother us with the ""how\'d everything turn out"" banter which I totally appreciate."
Lawrence L.,Millbrae  CA,362,489,2653,11/4/2010,4.0,Been to BJ's plenty of times  but tonight was special! We were here with some colleagues and the vibe was electric since the Giants were in the World Series  and this would be the game to take it all. One of my friends got here a little early so we had prime seating with a great view of the main large flatscreen tv. A very different experience than I have ever had at a BJ's  since everyone was pretty much rooting for the same team  and cheering was not held back.Now for the food  we ordered their Best Beginnings appetizer sampler platter: their avocado egg rolls were great  tortillas chips with spinach and cheese dip was nice  mozzarella sticks were gone before I could taste one (so they must have been good)  and Santa Fe Rolls were my fave on the platter (yummy). I ordered the chicken fried steak (as usual)  and was satisfied... I also tried their new Lightswitch Lager (clean and refreshing).Service was attentive  as they always kept our beer flowing. Especially on a busy night like tonight.Great place to catch a game! Go Giants!!!!!
Sheila P.,Hayward  CA,25,75,8,10/5/2014,3.0,I have to agree with many of the posts the food was delicious but the service was ridiculous. My partner and I waited over 25 minutes for anyone to address us after being seated. We actually had to go and ask who our server was. After being introduced to our server we ordered since we had ample time to review the menu  our server disappeared for another 20 minutes so we asked the manager to fulfill our drink order. Once the server returned he was very apologetic but we were over the experience and apologies close to tip time don't appease us. Three stars for the tasty food. We will not be going back due to the poor service.
Karla g.,Union City  CA,86,225,52,11/17/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Bad service:Me: Id like a glass of wine and a glass of water please.BJs server: If I get you a glass of water  ill have to get the whole table a glass of water... Are you sure you want water? Me: YES.Wow.
Lisa C.,San Leandro  CA,0,4,,8/1/2014,2.0,Service here was terrible. Waited an hour for our food. The waitress had an attitude and had horrible customer service. Drinks were way too sweet and also took forever to get. Will never go there again!!
James B.,Fremont  CA,0,16,2,1/28/2015,3.0,I really really like bjs and the food. The only thing is one time I came in for they're brunch because I was there the previous week and had seen and ad on the table about it so I went next week to go to brunch and no one was there so I was confused if they were doing it or what so me and my family stood at the door whiting to be helped and no one did of even offered and information just kept looking at us and walking by would of been nice if someone would at least acknowledged us but no one did so we went to ihop. But at night they have good service and good food.
Seeking B.,San Jose  CA,0,4,,6/19/2016,1.0,horrible service checked in @12:30 waited till 4 to get food. yes we were party of 10 but there was absolutely zero service
Albert C.,Milpitas  CA,9,16,5,3/23/2014,1.0,Absolutely disappointing. Decided to give them a few tries before writing my report but after giving them the benefit of the doubt a total of four times  I can easily say they have failed to redeem themselves  and in fact  worsened in quality each and every time.The first time I came here with a friend the wait was alright. Maybe 10-15 minutes  which is quite understandable. I ordered a jalapeno burger with the patty cooked rare. I cannot say how long I waited for the food because I was engaged with conversation with my friend  so I will not comment on it just yet. However when the burger did arrive  my hopeful expectations for a rare juicy beef patty were shot down by a well done. Now I have made my own burger patties before  I can easily say...rare does not take a lot of work at all. When someone is willing to eat their meat rare  please understand that they mean it. Anyways  I told the server the issue  and although they offered to take it back  I declined. Why? Because 1) we had a movie to catch  and 2) I simply don't like wasting food. Ate it  disappointed and disgruntled  but still  tipped our server 15% simply because it was not his fault  and he took the appropriate actions to correct this mistake.Second and third was I was here with co-workers on lunch break. Lunch rush wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately. However our server was harder to get a hold of than the metaphorical needle in a haystack. He sat us down  told us he would be back to take our orders shortly. Our timeline was we arrived at BJ's at 12:00PM on the dot. We did have have our orders taken until 12:20. I did not dare order the burgers again this time. Instead I got the simpler lunch special  sandwich and soup with a side of fries. Much less disappointing as I see less of a chance to screw up a sandwich  soup and fries. However they did give me wedge cut when I wanted thin and crispy fries. Whatever  not a big deal. (At this point I feel the cost is not worth the food)Now today (March 22  2014) my friend suggests we get BJ's. I wanted black bear  but my friend wanted drinks  so fine...We wait half an hour to have our pager start buzzing. That was once again  understandable and expected due to it being dinner rush. We are seated and we are given time to order. I order the Ahi Poke as an appetizer and decide to give the burgers another chance. Same order. Rare and thin crisp fries. I even told the waiter to make sure it is rare because they messed up the last time. He assured me it would be what I ordered. We waited about 20 minutes for our food. Shorter wait time I suppose. Got the burger  and it is ******* well done again. Not even slightly pink. It is browned in the center! I tell the server  and this time I have it sent back. It takes them another half an hour to get me another burger. Now I am not saying I am more important than the other patrons of the restaurant  when a customer comes in saying his order was messed up before  and he orders the same thing  only to have the same mistake again. You would expect there would be better communication between the workers  and that the customers service may be just a little faster. If I wanted to wait around in stuffy building for half an hour to be seated  and another half hour to be disappointed  and then the next half hour to be starving  without food  brooding  watching other people eat  and just be out right PISSED  I can do that in the COMFORT OF MY OWN HOME! I can easily just NOT COOK DINNER  AND WATCH FOOD NETWORK  WHERE A REAL CHEF COOKS FOOD AND ENJOYS WHAT HES EATING. I told the server to simply just put the burger To-Go as soon as it finishes  give me my check immediately  I just want to pay  and leave. This place is absolutely terrible. Never again. I'm telling my coworkers to never come back here again. My friends no longer have a say in where we are going if they suggest FREMONT BJ's. I have never been so upset with both SERVICE  and FOOD. BJ's you guys suck. Yeah maybe you didn't f*ck up my sandwich  but hell if I am paying you guys a cent for half a sandwich  let alone 9 dollars and tip. I'm going to Togo's or Subway. Cheaper  faster  and not full of FUCK UPS.
Robert H.,Milpitas  CA,11,63,14,2/4/2013,4.0,BJ's in Newark is tucked in at the 880 Mowry interchange  so eyes open or you will miss it. The parking is shared with a dead Mervyn's store and the lot is so chopped up that you don't want to navigate it while tipsy.Parking is somewhat of a problem for a brewhouse that pushes large and tiny glasses of beer. This place is busy all the time  so you'll be parking a fair distance from the entrance in the Swiss cheese parking lot.The fare in BJ's is tasty and the service was attentive and prompt when we went on Saturday afternoon. Seating is in booths or at tables and televisions showing sport events are spread all around.The food is of that saucy  cheese-filled  bready fried variety. It's similar to what you find at Yardhouse. There are very few plates on the menu with fewer than 1200 calories  and if you drink beer  well  maybe you should fast for a few days afterward. Even their light menu  which is maybe 6 items  hovers at 600 calories each.The Newark establishment is smaller than the one in Glendale  but the overall effect is the same--trendy high-cal food and fresh beer served in comfortable  stylish surroundings.One note: the paper napkins delivered with the food are cocktail-sized. Be sure to ask for table service and cloth napkins  unless you are intent on eating with your fingers.
Lanie T.,Hayward  CA,34,173,,8/20/2012,2.0,"First time last night. Maybe last time?Kudos for witnessing the staff in the VERY nice bathroom  cleaning. That\'s nice!Kudos for quick seating and polite service.Service was lacking. Our server was very sweet but quite confused. We ordered fried artichokes as appetizer. Another chick brought it and laid it down proudly...but it was stuffed mushrooms.No biggie. Here\'s my biggie: Proud Chick ARGUED about it. ""Isn\'t this what you ordered?"" Repeated in different words about five times.Listen  sweet cheeks. WE ARE THE CUSTOMERS. WE ORDERED ONE THING AND YOU BROUGHT ANOTHER. SO SHUT THE F UP AND BRING US WHAT WE ORDERED WITHOUT A HASSLE  OK?We ordered steaks with sides. One of my sides was green beans. When my order came  I counted: SEVEN string beans? WTF???? I realize that corners need to be cut  but come on...STRING BEANS!!!!??? Give me 15 and I might be happy! Doesn\'t the meat cost you more than veggie\'s?And I realize this is a growing trend  but especially for venues that make you wait for your food....WHERE\'S THE BREAD?We inquired and were grudgingly allotted two stale dinner rolls.BJ\'s! You\'re in NEWARK CA for godsakes! No view  no ambiance. Give us some damn bread  green beans and service!Not going back. Sorry. Nice people working there  really. But not worth the bucks!Oh  but I had one of their star cocktails--a peach something something. Really  quite good."
Luigi H.,San Francisco  CA,179,26,5,2/11/2013,2.0,I've been to BJ's a few times and its always been 'okay'. Normally I dine in and the food comes out in good sized portion and the food is okay...maybe a 3 star level. However  today I picked up a personal pizza for a friend and are you kidding me? I called the order in and the guy said it was enough for 1-2 people  but seriously  this thing is barely enough for 1 person. Maybe more for a kid. This thing was tiny! For $13 you're better off getting a Costco slice of pizza. I should of gotten the larger pizza but I assume that would have cost me over $20. No way worth what I paid. I'm giving them 2 stars for staying open late and the staff is friendly but for today's experience was a huge turnoff.
Luis M.,Fremont  CA,0,3,,1/24/2016,1.0,Love BJ's but hate the fact that every time I come they have us waiting here for an hour and a half the least just to get us seated and some water served. Today we had to deal with a dumb ass manager named Gene or Jean that made us wait 45 mins because we had 5 people and not 6. What kind of dumb management is that. And she didn't even seem to care that we were mad. Zero stars if I could. Love the food but management pissed me off.
Corinne T.,Fremont  CA,31,33,16,8/14/2012,1.0,I got food poisoning from the Newark location in July 2012. Got it from the shrimp...or it could have been the Southern Egg Rolls. I've never had food poisoning before & man do I never want to experience that again. Also  HORRIBLE customer service...the lady manager with blonde hair is rude & not friendly. I called there once to make a to go order for my whole company...they put me on hold three separate times for 30mins each time...I was pissed! Then I called back & asked for the manager...they put me on hold for another 30mins until I just hung up. I called back at a later/not as busy time...spoke to the manager & she offered me a dessert if I wanted to come pick it up. Nice...but no thanks...last thing I wanted to do is drop everything I was doing to drive to BJs for your f*ck up! ugh!
Valerie A.,Oakland  CA,297,210,268,10/8/2012,3.0,I went here this past weekend with a friend for drinks.Saturday nights  beware  it's PACKED!We luckily squeezed our way into the bar area. We were served by bartender Cory who was very fast and took care of us.The Giants vs. Reds Game 1 of the Division Series was on  and I was so happy so be front and center in from of the big screen.The crowd is loud and definitely folks who are seasoned drinkers. My friend and I ordered a flatbread and potato wedges to go with our drinks.The food is ok. It's bar food. I don't expect much. You need those carbs to hold down the drinks. What's nice is the alcohol selection and what they have on tap. The bathrooms are nice  the floors are clean  and the service is fast. That's all I really need for a few drinks and something to snack on. It's much pricer that anywhere I usually go to watch a game or have drinks  but there isn't much in the tri-city area.Until next time  bottoms up!
Melissa B.,San Antonio  TX,100,14,13,11/18/2014,4.0,This was a really good choice for dinner. We had a party of 7 and were seated right away. Food was really good. The waitress we had was amazing. She made sure our drinks were filled without hesitation and we had everything we needed. They have military discounts and really awesome kid programs to earn free meals. Definitely going back to this particular location.
Maynard M.,San Jose  CA,146,129,129,6/8/2011,4.0,I've had BJ's before (mind outta the gutter) and I loved it  jk I didn't think much of it. I thought their food was too starchy and the closest one was in South San Jose. I still didn't bother to check it out even though they opened one by my place. The only reason I checked it out was all the FB posts of the pazookie.Pros-pazookies-good selection of beers-lettuce wraps-cleanCons-wait time  place gets really packed. I guess Fremont loves their BJ's-doughy pizza-happy hour aint really happy hour with their limited specials and only discount like a buck off drinks
Sunil R.,San Francisco  CA,705,2291,12,8/3/2010,4.0,Woohoo!! This place is legit and my new favorite American food  sports bar in the East Bay. Very nicely done  the set up and colors remind me of P.F Changs.The service was great  friendly and prompt. The drinks were very good too  from the mojitos to the martinis. The food was excellent and I liked everything we tried. The flatbreads  the deep dish pizza and the parmesan crusted chicken were delish. Dessert with the cookies and ice cream were yummy. Yes  the location is a little strange but I will be back.
Grace Y.,San Jose  CA,1855,882,181,6/10/2010,3.0,Every single thing I've had here has been absolutely delish! I would probably eat here more if:1. It was closer to me.2. If the wait wasn't absolutely ridiculous at all times.3. If they took reservations seriously  instead of whatever list they do that doesn't save you any time but makes you feel like you were saved a spot. 4. Their service was reasonable...even below average would be fine...but it's horribly slow and they forget everything so if you're picky  you're kind of out of luck. 5. Their to-go wasn't so slow and they stopped forgetting things all the time and then tried to give me ice cream to make up for their mistake when I catch it. 6.Cheaper food. Food is on the pricier side for this type of chain joint. You can definitely eat cheap here if you share. 7. If it wasn't so crowded and loud. There's nowhere to stand if you're waiting  and the bar area is always full. Also  there's always a birthday celebration or two and they get kind of crazy sometimes.The food is delicious  so I will be back to stuff my face.
Jennie S.,San Francisco  CA,40,44,1,9/11/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,ONCE AGAIN AWFUL...Why did I give in and say ok to trying again.Wait an hour  get ONE drink...not two. then second drink comes out after food is almost done and the food was all wrong. Stop hiring shitty chefs . food made me sick. Threw up for the rest of the night . so pissed.
Brandy D.,Mountain View  CA,8,58,75,8/14/2012,2.0,We gathered for a friend's birthday on Saturday August 4th. We had called ahead to arrange a party of 10 to be arriving at 7:30 pm. When we arrived  the young gentleman at the front desk was not very nice. He said sorry  we don't have any record of a phone call saying you were coming with a large party. He said sorry  you will have to wait 45 minutes to an hour. We waited  finally were seated. The food was good. The service was ok  (we always had to flag someone down for a drink refill)... the front desk was terrible. Both female and male hosts were rude and very unprofessional. Terrible customer service.This BJ's gets two stars: one for actually seating us within the hour  and a second for delivering our food on time.
Robb J.,Hayward  CA,71,143,261,8/2/2013,3.0,Great place to celebrate some accomplishment or birthday at this place. Nothing really bad to say about this location  good clean atmosphere. Have to have a pizookie (cookie with ice cream on top) for desert!
Valerie L.,San Francisco  CA,415,35,43,12/7/2012,3.0,Had the 2 for $20 deal here. Comes with 2 soup or salads  medium pizza  and a pizookie. Medium pizza can be customized to order  which was a huge perk  because for about a few dollars less  my friend and I were going to get just a medium deep dish. Instead  we got salads and dessert to go along with it!Pizza was just alright...wasn't hot enough. I like my cheese to be stringy and messy to separate. However  the dough they use is always amazing and flavorful.I tried the Irish Pear beer on a whim  and didn't regret it. It's extremely light and not too fruity. Try to seat yourself at the bar to avoid hour long waits for tables  if you're with 1 or 2 people. Service is quick and friendly.
Oscar H.,San Francisco  CA,12,58,50,7/29/2011,4.0,Been to a couple BJ's  including this one when it first opened  but usually just for beers. This time I actually tried some of the food. We waited about half an hour to be seated. The place was packed and noisy  but not too crazy. Started off with a glass of Jeremiah Red. No need to say anything here  their beers are always on point and Jeremiah Red is my brew of choice.For appetizers  we ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and 2 Mini Chicken Tacos. Both were good  but the stuffed mushrooms stole the show. Definitely recommend those to start your dinner right.Then I didn't really want anything too big so I had the Grilled Chicken Pesto Flatbread Pizza. It was alright. For some reason I enjoyed the first two dishes more.Although the wait was kinda long I wouldn't mind coming back to try some other food on another occassion.
Angelica P.,Fremont  CA,407,166,396,9/17/2010,2.0,Been here twice with my brother. The only reason why we came here is because this is one of the few places open in our area when he gets off work (10:30pm). First time we came around 11pm. We didn't realize that the dining room closes at 11pm and the only place we can sit is at the bar. Then  we found out that the only thing you can order after 11pm is appetizers and pizzas. The first time we came we were frustrated that none of this was mentioned on their website. So  we just ordered a mini pepperoni and had it to-go. We brought a 5 year old with us so we didn't want to sit by the bar.The second time we came was a little better since we knew what to expect. This time it was just me and my brother so we sat down and ordered an appetizer combo and a mini Mediterranean to share. The service was ok and the food was ok. The food wasn't bad....it was just blah. Nothing stood out for my taste buds..but it was edible.
Ashley T.,Newark  CA,10,10,1,5/1/2015,1.0,I've always ordered the Santa Fe Salad here at Bjs and every single time I order it  it turns out delicious and they always give a good amount. But when I ordered it today  they gave me half of the original position and barley had any salad in it. I called to complain and the manager said to bring it back to see it. Once we got there  she accused us of eating it beforehand and said that's why the portions were so little. I never met a manager like her before  accusing the customer of eating half of it and returning it? I wouldn't have wasted my gas and sit in traffic to go all the way back to change it. She wasn't genuinely sorry about it  she just blamed us. I hope they can fix their customer service and management because it is unacceptable to treat customers like that.
Khaled A.,Castro Valley  CA,6,109,22,6/7/2013,4.0,I don't eat burgers too often  but whenever I go to BJ  I always get a burger and fries. The burger are delicious and pretty big. The only complaint I have is  the chef never makes by burgers properly the first time  its always done perfectly the second time.I ordered my burger medium rare  but it was cooked well.Even though the chef made a mistake  he/she always come out and personally serve the burger to you and make sure it up to your standards.Overall  considering this is a chain restaurant  there food (atleast the burgers)  are excellent  unlike some other places um um um Pyramids (there food has gone down the toilet and their prices have gone sky high).
Ram V.,Fremont  CA,0,1,,1/1/2016,1.0,Been here many times and the service is not the best. Today it has been pretty particularly bad. Had to wait for cheese and pepper for 20 mins and by the time we got it  we were done with the the pizza! Sorry - did not have a good experience!
Cynthia V.,Oakland  CA,100,95,37,11/2/2012,2.0,Good vibe  decent food. Love the home brews. Wait staff was very helpful and attentive.Ladies - skip the heels when stopping by here. It's an embarrassing trip to your behind just waiting to happen! Seriously  lay off the wax BJ's! 
Dave A.,Fremont  CA,22,91,16,5/22/2013,4.0,Service: about the same as you would find in any big restaurant chain  its better then your average. Food: now this is where they are above the rest  quality product with good prices. Must try : jalapeo Burgers
Manju J.,Fremont  CA,1,27,,7/20/2014,2.0,Went there for lunch . Big mistake They were busy with parties of 15-20 they forgot all about me  my friend and her son.The waitress was so slow and not attentive. It made me so mad by the time I got the food the taste of food didn't matterFood was ok but very greasy Kids Mac n' cheese was very dry and my tomato bisque had oil floating in it !!Now I remember why I had not gone there in over 3 years!!
Mary K.,Silver Spring  MD,72,92,2,7/27/2012,3.0,I would have given them a better review if I was just basing the experience on days I would just sit in the bar over a couple of drinks  but on one occasion it was pretty much one disaster over the other. RESERVATIONS---My immediate family is big  which is why we usually opt for call ahead seating. My sister called when they opened letting them know that we would be there. We all arrive 15 minutes prior to our reservation and they let us know that they had us on the list  but took us off because the girl who took it down did everything wrong. Told us we would have to wait an additional hour 15 minutes for seating (It was Father's day and the last game of the basketball series). Pretty :(   but went with it anyways. My sister decided to stay with the pager  while the rest of us headed out to Lion Super Market to shop around to kill time...Come on 1 hour 15 minutes ridiculous!!!! (According to the other reviews  this isn't a new issue)DROPPED PIZZA; Blagh STEAK:Since the game was over  things slowed down a bit. We were able to put in our order and ordered two of their steaks  a steak salad and an XL wheat crust pizza have buffalo chicken and cheeseburger. The order came  the steaks were over cooked  my mom's steak salad had only about 3 pieces of steak and a scant handful of mixed greens. The ended up giving us a small pizza and a medium pizza since they ran out of the XL wheat crust...except they dropped the medium pizza on the floor. They offered to replace it. My sisters and I ended up sharing the small pizza (4 of us). By the time the replacement pizza came in  we were already done with our meal. REPLACEMENT PIZZA: So they end up making us a replacement pizza; that shit was burnt and they still expected us to eat it  The bottom was charred and honestly we didn't want to eat it and were already full with what we had. We told the waitress who notified the manager and he saw how burnt it was  he offered to replace it again. We could careless  so he offered to take it off our bill. I understand that it was a busy day  but in general I was pretty much disappointed with the rushed service  missed orders  and the burnt pizza (come on  you drop our pizza and then replace it with a burnt one?! How does that make any sense. I used to love going to BJs in La Jolla  but this one not so much. Left a good tip anyways since they tried..or tried to try
Gorlan L.,Oakland  CA,31,1,,4/21/2014,4.0,Foods good the lemon chicken new dish is awesome please try. I asked for a booth but the host Calob sat me and my girlfriend at a tiny little table but i notice that he sat other tables of party of 2 at a booth that can fit at least 6 people. Also it was monday around 11 at night and it was not busy. So if you do come here and want to be seat where you want to please remind him 2-3 times so he can accurately seat you where you want to be seated.
Jessica C.,Los Angeles  CA,91,125,21,1/25/2011,4.0,I eat at this BJ's way too often. Pretty much every time we have an event with friends we always decide to eat at BJ's. We like to dress up and go out and eat with the girls  so it's a nice place to dress semi-formal and not have people just stare at you weird for wearing a dress . Again  I always get the half rack ribs here  unless I'm really hungry then I might go for a whole rack ;) BUT the best part has to be the pazookie. You can't leave without getting one and I recently realized they had white chocolate ones ! gah was I missing out ! The waiters/waitresses are all really friendly too and always greeting you with a smile  and it makes you feel good   better then having a cranky waiter that's for sure. Wait lines   might be a tad bit long during fridays and weekends  but it usually goes by pretty fast .
Alberto S.,San Leandro  CA,132,6,5,5/21/2012,1.0,"Came in here with my girlfriend after she gets off and work and the wait was only 20 minutes and that wasnt that badOnce we sat down we were pretty much ready to order and i ordered a simple small pepperoni pizza and she got a mini bbq chicken. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. I dont think it takes that long to bake a pizza.When the food finally came out it was cold and i could of easily held the pizza tray with my hand. Also my girlfriends bbq chicken looked like it got slumped on a plate and did not look good at all. We told our waitress who said she just got it out of the oven yet she was able to carry the obviously cold pizza tray with her hands. She said she would have them make us new ones. 30 more minutes go by and still nothing. We decided to give up  so we tell her nevermind just cancel our order and she gave us a dirty look. Instead of apologizing and going to check on our order she rudely said  ""okay "" and walked away. Won\'t be coming back to this location again  i\'d rather wait until the new one opens up in Pleasanton."
Betty K.,Newark  CA,23,56,82,10/21/2014,5.0,Cool environment! Great service...boozooki yay!!!!
Jacki C.,Newark  CA,24,74,5,8/17/2012,4.0,DH and I come here often for an EARLY dinner and drinks. I emphasize early because if you come during normal hours  whether on a weeknight or weekend  you are bound for a wait. Therefore  we adopt the Sr Dinner Hr. Not only do we not have to wait  we can partake in the happy hrs specials on drinks and appetizers. Although they are known for their deep dish pizzas we mostly stick with the appetizers and small plates. We normally get the seared ahi  stuffed 'shrooms  fried artichoke hearts  flatbread pizzas  etc. Our favorite is the seared ahi tuna. They don't have it on the menu anymore  but they will still make it for you if you ask. And of course beer  beer  beer  and maybe just one more beer. They have a lot of beers to choose from and some nice seasonal drafts. But don't get too hooked on their seasonal creations  because you will miss it when it goes away :(We mostly sit in the bar area and the servers there are always on top of their game! We've noticed that the service in the main dining area is not always as good.Then before we leave  we normally leave with a mini pazookie!!! Yeah!This is dinner done right!!
Bannister C.,San Fernando Valley  CA,42,445,62,9/10/2014,3.0,The food served here is without a doubt good tasting. It is the loud  uncomfortable  chaotic environment that takes its toll on you. Not a place to enjoy and relax and appreciate your meal. Perhaps the owner should hire an acoustic engineer to see how the noise can be attenuated. A shame it really is too loud inside.
Alexis Nicole B.,Hayward  CA,62,11,4,8/24/2013,4.0,I would honestly go back there again!It was a great experience. My friend and I were trying to find a place that sell desserts and was open late at night  when we stumbled upon BJ. The waiting time for the two of us on a Wednesday night was very short. To the point were they said they'll buzz for us and it only took one minute. Poor me  they didn't even give me enough time to go the bathroom. I know...tmi. But the waiter (his name i forgot) was simply amazing. He was very patient and kind and nice. My friend and i ordered two cookies 'n creme pizookie for kids (four- something dollars)  a spicy meatball pizza for us to share(13.50)  and two strawberry lemonade (free refills). It cost 28 dollars but it was 28 dollars well spent.
iPunchfish -.,Campbell  CA,35,265,13,1/20/2013,2.0,Schmoozed up by the TO-GO guy and ended up getting the Party Plus Plus dealio for 4 to 6. 40 minutes later we grab the food and run back to our friends house. We find that the party plus pack is enough to feed 4 to 6 midgets. Damn you  slick TO-GO guy.
steven p.,Clovis  CA,0,2,8,11/8/2015,5.0,Our server April was the best everything came out great. Beer was on point and food was good now just waiting on my pizookie
Beverly R.,Fremont  CA,109,132,32,5/1/2012,2.0,Yea  2 stars is about right.3 stars for the tiny stuffed mushroom appetizer  spongy deep dish pizza (um  it's suppose to have a crunchy base  and layers of sauce and toppings not a big fluffy disk of carbohydrates)  and shirley temple with twice the amount of grenadine it should have had. 2 stars for my rude server who did not once actually plant himself in front of us (aside from when he was taking our order) to actually listen to our response or requests. he literally walked by each time he had something to say. He would chat it up with the family next to us and make sure their order was perfect.  I'm still not too sure what the reason behind that was since we are a presentable looking family that obviously can afford a place like BJ's and tip well (if deserved). He was just not interested in serving us and eager to move on to the next table. 1 star for the long wait for our order. Remember that table next to us that received the special attention? They ordered about 5 minute after my party ordered but got their food 10 minutes before ours arrived. From appetizer to entrees we waiting 45 minutes. It's not like this is fine cuisine...it's BJ's for crying out loud!
Silvia R.,Hayward  CA,28,72,65,5/24/2013,2.0,The food is great but the service is horrible! Our waitress only came around to take our order and never came back to check on us if we needed anything else. No waters and no ketchup for our fries and didn't get a chance to order more drinks. Noh and to top it off my boyfriend had to get up and go ask her for the check what kind of bs is this? Extremely disappointed with the service we got today! Will def. Think twice before coming back to this place!
Eddie B.,Fremont  CA,6,31,17,10/31/2014,3.0,I gave a 3 because while I love Bj's Restaurant because I always get high quality food. But my issue is this one location uses big tomatoes in their Tomato and Mozzarella salad and chops them in 4ths. Which means you get these huge pieces of tomato with a few little pieces of mozzarella. Every other franchise uses the cherry tomatoes and cuts them in half which makes them about the same size as the cheese. Told management last time and he agreed they were wrong.... Still no change so I will continue reviewing
Alan D.,San Jose  CA,1126,413,319,7/29/2010,5.0,Okay  so I ate at this place yesterday with my fellow Target Interns and it was a great meal!We had straw fries (delicious!) and these kettle chips with parmesan cheese it was awesome and amazing!I chose to eat the Cajun pasta which was spiced just right and had the right kick... OH and for once my chicken wasn't dry as a desert!But the reason why I really give this place 5 stars is because of the team they have here. I accidentally left my iPod touch on the chair after I finished eating (my dumb mistake) and realized it was missing but I didn't know where I left it!So began my journey of calling every place that I had been to and receiving a no answer and finally just deciding to call them this morning and bam! There it is! So I'm just glad that their team actually took the time to actually place it in the lost and found rather than taking it themselves... I've encountered that incident before it's not fun.So if you ever lose anything... lose it here  the team will take care of you!
Jennifer N.,San Jose  CA,7,13,4,5/2/2014,4.0,Great food. Five star service today but usually the service there is a 3 star or lower. Hopefully they keep it up! Happy hour menu should be better in my opinion if they want more business around the slow hours.
Brian W.,Fremont  CA,26,23,10,6/14/2013,4.0,"Pros: Great ambiance if you like a great social setting that doesn\'t feel overwhelming.      A plethora of choices to choose from.      Great seating if your lucky enough to get the crescent shaped booths      Pleasant ServiceCons: A bit packed during busy hours (Call ahead to avoid the wait)I have been to several BJ\'s before and am OK in general with the franchise but I was pretty impressed with their Newark location. This particular location is by far the largest of the BJ\'s I have been to. The restaurant to me gave off a classic 1920\'s look with a contemporary edge. We called ahead to avoid a rather large wait time and got seats right away! To start the night off right  my party ordered the ""choose 8"" beer option. This gives you the chance to try 8 different beers. Its probably about 3 beers in total (double shooters) and really helps you learn what types of beers you like.We ordered the artichoke dip which was pretty good  not spectacular  but the beer made it just right. Our meals were cooked well and fast. I ordered a spicy pasta which only tingled. But the flavor was good in general. Our server and host were both extremely friendly and made us feel like we were VIP\'s which made the evening really memorable. Overall  I would highly recommend this BJ\'s location. Great dining experience  too bad the food was just good not great."
Amy J.,East Los Angeles  Los Angeles  CA,526,1755,161,7/12/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,This is the ONLY thing in this abandoned shopping center. They do have a good happy hour though I will admit. You can get half off a mini deep dish pizza from 3pm-7pm (I think those are the hours I could be wrong) or $2 off any appetizer. There might be a deal on the beers but I'm not sure. You can also get a free birthday sized Pizookie if you sign up for their email list.Not bad. The prices are ok. I think it's on par with most other chain restaurants. One thing I noticed this time around was there was an odd smell near the bar. It smelled like rotten cheese which made me think of going to a different location next time around. Maybe it was what the people behind me ordered  but it didn't make for a pleasant experience. Oh well  I got my food for a decent rate and a free dessert - I can't complain. Our servers were also really nice and attentive.
Avni S.,Sunnyvale  CA,257,258,306,12/4/2012,3.0,I've been to BJ's many times and I love the fact that they have so many options to choose from. I usually get their Spinach and Artichoke pizza and it is tasty. For appetizers  you can't go wrong with the avocado egg rolls. If your vegetarian  I'd avoid getting their Veggie burger and the giant baked potato  it's not that great.I think the chocolate chip pizookie or any other pizookie outshines all their food. As far as service is concerned: when we got seated  no server came to our table for like 15 minutes. We had to grab another server and even then it took him 10 years to bring us our drinks. Overall  the food is average but dessert is 4 stars. Good hangout spot.
Nicole M.,Fremont  CA,14,202,59,8/9/2014,4.0,Best time to go here is during lunch time! Lunch specials are a great deal and man i love their pizoookies! I always order their Chicken Tortilla Soup when here. Salads  appetizers  sandwiches  burgers and fried chicken is good here.
John L.,Fremont  CA,139,99,98,7/28/2010,1.0,I went there for my first time and this place gave the worst service then any other restaurants that I have been to. Even McD or Olive Garden surpass this place when it comes to service. Not one employee from BJ came up to us to greet us. I do see them walking by and they never even made any eye contact. No acknowledgment after waiting there for more then 20 minutes. It's like we're all invisible to them. No Hello  or Welcome  or One moment please. I guess this please doesn't need our business. I would never come here or recommend anyone to go there unless you don't mind being treated as trash.
faith r.,Milpitas  CA,66,7,4,4/25/2014,1.0,"In a nut shell: service was horrible and our waitress made us feel like we were just a nusance and it obviously looked like she didn\'t want to be there. Also  shady plating of food  if it doesn\'t look right be sure to ask or you might get stuck paying full price for half an appetizer. What are you trying to do bjs  rip off your late night customers?? If you want to read full detail Its below. I will never be coming to this location again. Went here on Tuesday night at 11pm  a bit late but there were still plenty of people seated in the dining area and the bar. We were seated very fast and our waitress came rather promptly. Though a friend of ours went to the bathroom so we decided to wait a bit till he got back. We didn\'t see our waitress come back for at least 15-20 min. Though we saw her walk around  stand at the hostess stand talking with other coworkers  make eye contact with us (as we were trying to suggest we are ready to order) and just continue to walk by again. When she finally came she sounded a bit annoyed under her breath but tried to act nice  I ordered the little bites mac n cheese and my two friends ordered burgers. She quickly then left to put the order in but my friends thought of an appetizer so I suggested the spinach dip. We call her back over  looking even more annoyed she takes down the dip order and leaves. When the dip comes its literally half or maybe even a quarter of the size it usually is  and there was not one single whole chip among the bunch  they were just crumbs and a huge lettuce leaf taking up half the plate. I ask if this is how it comes or if they changed it. The runner said our waitress may have put in the ""happy hour"" portion and she would send our waitress over. Iv been to bjs many times and have never heard of a happy hour portion  and if there was the waitress should have specified. All of a sudden a new dip was brought out  I suppose its because the first one was obviously a mistake. I ask for more chips since the ones brought out were just crumbs the runner says to me ""crumbs? "" with a puzzled look on his face. Do you not see what was brought out!? It should have never left the kitchen like this in the first place. After that we finally when we see our waitress and she half heartedly apologized and said "" it\'s come out twice like this  the cooks must hate me"". Way to look professional and deflect the blame. We find out later a group of 4 had the same thing happened to them cause we can see them complaining to the same waitress we had. My guess is they only just gave each of us half portions expecting us not to catch on and charge us full price. It even took her a good 10-15 min to even get our check. My guess was  she was complaining about us to the manager cause he kept looking over. I do love bjs and go quite often but I will never come to this location if that is how im going to be treated. I get its almost the end of your shift  you must be tired and want to just go home  but at least act like you give a damn."
Bubba G.,Union City  CA,22,215,31,5/10/2013,2.0,The lunch specials are worth it. Otherwise  the food is okay. You are really paying for the trendy atmosphere here.My kids love the pizookie. It is a cookie and ice cream dessert that is quite tasty!
Nancy J.,Minden  NV,30,216,28,4/6/2012,4.0,Great service... Jason is the best. Food good  but my husbands baked potato was luke warm and had a brownish tint like it had been in a warmer all day  this cost them a star. Came here tonight because my daughters went to school with Grace Kim...  RIP Grace  it is not fair what happened to you in Oakland.
Araceli T.,Fremont  CA,1,6,,12/2/2014,2.0,The food is generally pretty good  but not good enough to make up for the exorbitantly long wait to receive it after ordering.
Stephanie D.,Hayward  CA,83,3,,10/5/2015,2.0,"So we went out last night to eat here for my fiancs cousins birthday and I got to say the service was terrible. The food wasn\'t good and most things my fianc asked they didn\'t have. I thought it was going to be really good to eat here but overall I didn\'t like the food. I ordered the pepperoni pizza and it had too much garlic! My fianc ordered the clam chowder bowl and he said it tasted like it came out the can. We both didn\'t finish our meals. And to top it off we had asked for a birthday pazookie for his cousin in advance and didn\'t get it till and hour and half later. They said they hadn\'t made it yet. I think they just forgot cause when my sister told them again they said okay we will make it. They just gave it to him and that\'s it. I thought they had to put candle on it or something but no. So we didn\'t think much of it till 30 mins later we seen two employees give another customer a pazookie with a lit candle and they said ""enjoy!"" Not even us did they say anything. I was like are you kidding me! The worst service and also when I had said I didn\'t like the pizza the server rolled her eyes and mugged me. I was saying it nice so that they wouldn\'t think I was an annoying customer but it was the truth I did not like the pizza at all. I guess when you complain about the food they don\'t treat you right. Maybe I\'ll come back and try something different but this night was the worst! Didn\'t think it would be this bad. They took forever with our food and it was warm by the time it got to our table. Didn\'t know clam chowder took almost an hour to make if it was from a can. Idk about you but I hope they improve their service. I have never been treated his bad ever! Always a first time for everything"
Josephine C.,San Jose  CA,27,141,,6/11/2013,4.0,3-stars for over place and food. Extra 1-star for superb service that my friends and I had received last night.Our server was attentive. My friends and I had a slight issue with paying and so when we explained to our server what was going on  she took the extra couple of minutes to understand and make sure she got it correctly in terms of billing each person. I got the chili and cheese giant stuffed potato. It was good; however  it tasted like it was boiled rather than baked. The size of the potato had gotten smaller from the last time I had ordered it. Plus  I should've asked for extra chili on it since there wasn't enough on it. Good for one really hungry person.Overall  this is our usual BJs restaurant like any other around the bay area.
Jo C.,Santa Clara  CA,10,125,168,8/13/2014,4.0,Drinks were watered down. You can barely taste the alcohol. The server was somewhat attentive. We had our dishes piled up. No one came to get them till my friend made eye contact with a busser  who didn't come to our table  he just stared at my friend. Sweet pig and barbecue chicken pizzas were excellent and we didn't have to wait long.
AP A.,Alameda  CA,0,4,,5/24/2015,2.0,"Terrible service! We waited 1.5 hours for our food to be served. When delivered  food was cold and one entree was missing. The server when asked for why the delay  explained very very casually that they were missing a key ingredient and if I would like to substitute with something. Somehow the forgot to mention this during the 1.5 hours they made us wait. At this point everyone at the table had finished dinner. Very disappointed with the service. The food has still not arrived after servers just ""5 min"" to prepare comment. Server was not at all apologetic for the delay in food and missing the order. However the manager came by and was apologetic and hospitable and offered to pay for appetizers. Hence the 2 stars for his good hospitality."
Trung N.,San Jose  CA,696,408,54,11/30/2010,4.0,A very inviting and cozy environment that this location has. The decor is relaxed  and the service is above average compared to similar restaurants.Friendly service for sure  my group and I didn't have any problems with our waiter as he made sure we were taken care of. The food is delicious and is consistent with the other BJ's chains around.Definitely love their avocado egg rolls... and their root beer.. oh yes... it is a yummy  tasty non-alcoholic choice for a drink.
Paula O.,Fremont  CA,57,201,230,4/23/2012,4.0,Went on a Tuesday night with the BF. He had a pizza (their combo one) and i thought it was pretty good. I had the Grilled Pork with potatoes and green beans. It was one of their healthy items under 500 calories I think. I thought it was pretty tasty. We will definitely go again.
Raymund S.,Newark  CA,100,202,168,1/1/2014,2.0,I have been coming to this location for a couple of years  but now I really feel I need to comment on the service. The quality of service has really declined and the last time I was here with a group  it was really bad. Our orders were messed up and everything we individually asked for were not fulfilled. Its like they were not even writing down on paper what we were ordering and everything came out in a default configuration. My coworker specifically ordered a wedge salad with anchovies  and he got potatoe wedges. Really?? To make things worse  the last person in our party got her porkchops 20 minutes after everyone else got their food  and it was still messed up. She asked for roasted potatoes and she got mashed. She specifically asked for roasted. The icing on the cake was when we were about to pay for our bill  a server comes out and asked if we got the red velvet pizookie? LMAO is this really happening??The place was not busy at all and our 1 hour lunch turned into almost two hours.  The bill alone took 15 minutes to come out.What a shame  I hope the bar area isn't a big cluster f%*k as the seated areas.
Sumit S.,San Francisco  CA,36,44,72,7/10/2012,4.0,Never came here without an reservation and always left with sweet drunken memories. Don't know why people have given negative reviews  but I have always got a sweet and charming waitress.Always come here for a celebration or weekend get together with friends. Never disappointed with food  drinks or service. Even if we didn't like anything  waitress are more than happy to replace it with new.Thumbs up to BJ's :)
Eric L.,Fremont  CA,8,4,1,8/28/2013,5.0,I had to make a Yelp account just to post this. Great food and great service! I have never been treated so well at any other restaurant! They really know how to make their customers feel special! Last night  my friend had a going-away party at this restaurant and he made the right choice  choosing this place. The staff treated all 16 of us really well. Our food came at a good time. Since the night was really hectic my jalapeo burger ended up rare instead of the medium I ordered  as multiple jalapeo burgers were ordered at our table. The waiters empathized and went out of their way to give me a fresh burger and a free take home meal. It was delicious! They also helped us celebrate two birthdays at our table. Everyone went home happy and feeling like stars! If you are thinking of celebrating a special event or are looking for delicious food and service that makes you feel like a star  I recommend this BJ's to you!
Steve H.,Newark  CA,68,70,45,1/24/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Most BJ's are pleasant. However  this one in particular lacks finesse. Put a little bit of effort in it please. You know that was coming  pause. Although there's a gang of people stopping by for a quickie during lunch  the wait is minimal since there's a lot of hands on the job ready to service you. My cousin and I shared the Avocado Eggrolls  Grilled Chicken Club with a cup of Clam Chowder  and a Pina Colada.Avocado Eggrolls - Crispy tubes stuffed deep with avocado. The sweet  sticky sauce on the side plays nicely with the eggrolls. Grilled Chicken Club - Moist  succulent chicken breast topped with crispy bacon and smothered in a creamy garlic mayo. Arousing to the tastebuds. The shoestring fries that go with this dish were titillating.Clam Chowder - Slurping goodness but overly salty.Pina Colada - If you want to black out and not remember how you ended up in a stranger's bed then drink a few of these. Tasted nothing but liquor. Don't expect a wild  mind blowing experience. This place is known to have it's up and downs. Stick with the beers and pizookie and you'll come out on top.
Sonia K.,Newark  CA,6,7,4,8/20/2014,1.0,Service is super slow ! I work in the food industry and having your hair down while serving food not OKAY a table next too me just complained of having a long string of hair in their food ! Your hair should be up in a pony tail or in a bun not down ! I understand your trying to attract customers but you can do it with your hair up ! And customers won't have hair in there food ! This definitely needs to be discussed with the manager ! Smh get it together . RIDICULOUS.
Karen L.,Fremont  CA,467,379,412,9/6/2010,3.0,"The first time at this place was awesome for me. I loved the decor  atmosphere  food  and everything actually surprised me.We had the best beginnings appetizer combo  and wow the avocado rolls were really good! The spinach dip was quite enjoyable as well  it was made just right.We had quite a few people so we shared a large deep dish pizza consisting of bj\'s cheeseburger/bacon and Mediterranean. The toppings were generous and the pizza dough was thick and fluffy. 2nd visit here was such a disappointment considering the last good experience. Everything was over oily and over done. The avocado rolls weren\'t as fresh as the first time and the consistency was very mushy  The waiter who served us was not even mentally there. We asked for half veggie and half bj\'s favorite  and we pretty much just got bj\'s favorite with minimal toppings. What the hell happened?? Then we asked him  ""didn\'t we get half veggie?"" He then comes by and says  hey well look at this half it has less meat on it so it\'s pretty much your vegetarian slice right here! WOW  wtf... wrong response!I was pretty annoyed after this visit  but I still believe that this place has potential. So perhaps the next time  (third time) will be the charm!"
Kay A.,Fremont  CA,42,155,102,5/4/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,BJ's is always a winning choice. The menu has a large variety of food  sure to please anyone. They have tons of homemade beer. The desserts are amazing! My Favorite time to go is during lunch cause they have wicked good lunch specials.   Dinner time gets VERY crowded  but is generally worth the wait.  I love their Mediterrean pizza  salads  ahi tuna  pizookie  turkey cobb sandwich  and chili!
Chris T.,San Leandro  CA,0,36,6,10/17/2013,4.0,"The wife and I went a week ago and had the cheese burger pizza  chili soup and she had the tortilla soup.   Everything was excellent as well as the service by our waitperson ""Reanna""  You should totally ask for her if you go because she is sooo good I gave her a 20% tip!  The Final test is my dreaded Day After Test for the pizza  you know - In the fridge and reheated in the Oven at 350 for ten minutes  Still Fantastic!      Totally go and have some food and Remember - the BEER is Delicious!!!      Remember ""Reanna"" too!"
Pratik D.,Fremont  CA,34,16,,8/17/2014,1.0,Horribly slow service. We waited around 20 minutes for someone to come pick up check payment. Had to get up and walk to counter for payment. No apologies even after this incident from them. Would not return ever again.
Josie H.,San Francisco  CA,245,563,13,9/10/2010,3.0,I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE.I ACCIDENTALLY SLIPPED AND THE TABLE NEXT TO ME LAUGHED AT ME:(Just kidding  I would come back here just for the pizookie!My family decided to come eat here:We got the mini hawaiian pizza- GOOD  I love this pizza! small cheeseburger pizza - it so salty  I don't understand why my sister would LOVE this one  but i guess if you're 18 and you like to eat  then try this one! grilled chicken pasta- kinda of tasteless  mediocre. and a chocolate chip pizookie- so SOOOO GOOD. I love their pizookies  even though I can really just bake a cookie at home and then put ice cream on it to save the 5.95 cents  but we are humans  and we tend to be lazy:)Our bill came out to be 57 dollars  hmmm  should have gotten sushi instead  but the pizookie was just soooooooo addicting for me!
Melissa M.,Hayward  CA,160,44,299,4/1/2012,4.0,Love this bj's! Ambiance is great and service is awesome... Place gets pretty packed  so I suggest u make reservations ahead of time. They accomodate big groups and I think its awesome that our waitress here made no mistakes with our bill when we went. Atleast none that I cud remember  it was very hard to tell tho coz she pretty much got all of us drunk...... lol..... The food is good but I really love their fish tacos .. a must try!
Phoebe T.,San Jose  CA,358,490,603,3/15/2010,2.0,"Let me start off with I went here on Valentine day but completely forgot to write a review  so it was my 3 friends & I  let me start off with the host we had was a female & she was completely rude. My friends were already there & I came a bit late since I live in SJ & all & when I arrived  instead of asking politely what I would like to drink she was like ""What do you want?""  I was like ""WHAT?!"" cause I didn\'t think I heard her correctly & I was thinking to myself  ""oh uh uh  this girl is asking to get laid out or something""  but after she heard MY rude ""WHAT?!""  she ended up asking me in a forcefully nice kind of way of what I would like to drink. Nuh uh. Bish you effed with the wrong girl. Waitress or not; be a little bit more respectful please. If you give respect  you get respect!Anyways  other than that little dispute we ended up getting a different waiter because she was actually about to get off work when I got there (thank goodness)  the waiter we got was pretty decent I guess. Okay so food  I ordered the pasta with chicken & brocolli  it was decent. It wasn\'t as creamy as I hoped it would be. Both my friends got the deep dish pizza; they said it was delicious but the first pizza the manager came out & told us they accidently dropped the pizza when they were about to bring it out so they had to get another one done so we waited for like an extra 15 minutes for his (still charged us FULL price). Overall  I don\'t think I would go back to this BJ\'s. As you can see why.I only gave it a 2 star because the service was very... Ahem  excuse me but SHITTY. But the dessert (apple crisp) was delicious as well as the pizza. But yes  no Bj\'s at this spot for me! I\'m sticking to the one in SJ!"
Maria A.,Union City  CA,1,2,,9/7/2014,5.0,I have gone to a lot of BJ'S over the years but this one has given me the best experience in along time. Lance was our server and he was awesome. My order came out wrong but he fixed it and gave us two whole pizzas free of charge. The manager came out to apologize and was very nice. I would come here anytime.
Lisa D.,Newark  CA,0,31,2,7/14/2012,1.0,"When a friend suggests we go to BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewery it makes me CRINGE. BJ\'s tries to trick you into believing that they\'re better than other local sports bars  grungy lounges  or late night restaurants. This is absolutely ludicrous thinking & a complete scam. Save your time  save your money  & stay away! I\'ve had better service at Applebee\'s! BJ\'s has provided the most consistently horrible service I have ever experienced at a ""restaurant"".When BJ\'s first opened it never really appealed to me  but I went with my friend & some of the cast after a show. We arrived around 11:30 pm & were ignored for more than 5 minutes. Once acknowledged  we were told to ""hold on"" so they could check to see if they had seating. Finally  we get lead to a table in the far left corner which would\'ve been great had my friend not been in a wheelchair. After flagging down someone to see if another table was available  we were rudely left maneuvering around chatting associates blocking the ramp & interrupting at least 3 other parties to clear enough space for her to get by. The only idea we received from BJ\'s staff was  ""Well  do you think she could get down the stairs?"". Although the dcor may be nice  the setup is abhorrent. Even a fully able-bodied person struggles to maneuver in BJ\'s.The night proceeded the way I\'ve now come to expect of BJ\'s- drinks forgotten or mixed up; food forgotten; dirty cups  plates  utensils  table; pathetic excuse of a waitress who takes orders & never comes back (another associate told us our waitress had left). When I went to order food at 12:30  I was shocked to be told the grill was off for the night already! I ordered a turkey sandwich & it was THE WORST sandwich I had ever had. For $10 I would expect deli-like quality  but this sandwich made even Subway look delicious. My sandwich consisted of two slices of toasted wheat bread slathered in mayo  a huge chunk of tomato  & about a half of a pound of pre-packaged sliced turkey. I wish I had waited until I got home  I could\'ve made a better sandwich there.A couple months ago  my boyfriend & I went to BJ\'s for drinks around 11:45 pm on a Friday. Luckily  we came together & he was there to walk me through the dark seedy parking lot. We sat at the bar area & were talking when the waitress came over. We asked for a few minutes only to be bombarded for an order 2 more times in less than 5 minutes  with our impatient waitress snidely stating that  ""the bar is going to close soon"". Umm  excuse me? Aren\'t you open for another hour??We ordered a round of drinks around 12 & called a friend to join us. He arrived about 12:15 & we ordered 6 more drinks in total & an entre. Halfway through  our waitress appears & states she hadn\'t expected more people to come in after 11:30  so she had made plans & was taking off; at least she left us with a replacement.At 12:50 a manager approached us & told that  ""it\'s time for you young folks to get out  we\'re closed"". I was so taken back by this distasteful & disrespectful treatment. We were paying customers in the establishment during business hours & not being loud or rowdy. If it was 1:05 perhaps  I could understand a gentle reminder that they need to clean up or something. Utter rudeness  from a manager no less  definite mood killer.Last night my boyfriend & I were looking for late night grubbing. We could\'ve gotten elsewhere  but for some unknown reason I thought going to BJ\'s would be a good idea. It was 12:15 pm  so I called in to inquire what time they planned to turn off the grill. I SPOKE WITH ASSOCIATE CHRIS who put the phone down to CHECK WITH A MANAGER & told me as long as I am in the establishment & have me order in by 1  they will honor it. All I can say is BULL SHIT!My boyfriend arrived at 12:45 pm prepared to be seated & order for us both as I would be a few minutes behind him. THEY REFUSED TO SEAT HIM! I arrived shortly after 12:50 pm to find myself locked out with a smug looking manager leaning on the door. I was LIVID!!! Why say you\'re open until 1 am  but then do everything you can to deny customers?! If you close at 1 am  that implies that your associates leave at 1:15 at the earliest not at 1 like your patrons should be! My boyfriend had placed a to-go order (minus the alcohol of course) & after calling him from the locked door & screaming at the manager through the glass  my boyfriend convinced him to let me in. I was sooo angry & making a bit of a scene  yet not once did any associate approach me to try to remedy the situation or understand my side. I had done my part & still got screwed by BJ\'s management again!I would never recommend BJ\'s to anyone! After everything  the food wasn\'t even that good. I could get the same caliber food at Red Robin at a lower cost  & maybe even TGI Fridays or Applebee\'s. I hope management reads this  because they ought to be ashamed of how they treat patrons in their establishment. Heed my warning- save your time & money- STAY AWAY!"
Shell I.,Union City  CA,112,94,88,8/15/2012,2.0,Definitely not one of my favs. If I have a choice  I usually go with the alternative to BJ's. Over the weekend  I ended up here again because my cousin really wanted to come here.We came for lunch. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and my cousin the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I didn't care for either of them. I find their food to be too salty and untasty  which is why I try to steer cleer of this place  and this occassion was no different. My quesadilla was oily on top and with the first bite I got lots of salt. However  I did enjoy the fried mozzarella sticks. This place is best for groups coming to drink and watch TV. For meals.....there are sooo many better options :)
Linh N.,Milpitas  CA,353,50,10,12/21/2011,2.0,So my friends and I came here last night for a secret santa exchange and we normally go to restaurants in big groups. Last night was the longest wait I ever had at any restaurant: approx 2 and a half hours. We were talking about going to another restaurant but since they gave us our estimated wait time as one and a half hour we decided to wait it out. In hindsight  we would've gone to another restaurant if we knew we were going to wait that long. There was a lot of confusion as to where they were going to seat us. After waiting for that long  they were still about to seat our group separately. We finally all got a table together in the end after all the confusion though. Be warned  DO NOT WEAR HIGH HEELS THERE UNLESS YOU LIKE FALLING. The floors there are incredibly slippery and dangerous to women with stilettos. I needed my friend to walk me around just to risk not injuring myself. After the long wait  my friends and I finally received our food but after digging in we decided that the wait was not nearly worth it. I got the angel hair toscana and it was just an okay dish  the noodles were bland. My friend ordered the tilapia and she wasn't really satisfied with her dish either. The only thing that anyone really liked that evening were the pazookis. Even the pazookis were hard to order because the waitresses and waiters barely paid attention to us and never cared to check up on us; it was nearly impossible to to get their attention. There also seems to be a lack of communication between the waiters since we got two pazookis when we only ordered one; we took the extra one anyways though.Summary: my friends and I should've gone to olive garden instead.
Jennifer A.,San Jose  CA,30,23,4,8/7/2014,1.0,Worst service ever!!! I don't know how new this bjs is or how crappy the managers are that they can't train their employees properly. I've been to many bjs. Northern and southern California and this has got to be the worst out of all of them. The waiter never came after we asked for a refill of water. My pizza was burnt and not pre cut it was a mission to even get a slice of pizza. I'm over this place. I would rather go to the blossom hill one and wait a lot longer than have to have service like this. Ridiculous. You pay for service this is definitely not the place to get that. I'll take my money elsewhere where they can refill my water after I ask for it and not half hour later. Or when my pizza is actually pre cut!
Stephanie G.,Fremont  CA,152,422,533,10/12/2012,4.0,Went here for a birthday celebration during happy hour. Love that the waiters/waitresses don't bug you when you just want to have a beer/appetizer. Wide variety of foods and beverages. I'm in love with the great white shark pizza  yummy! Tried the chicken wings this last time (just the plain ones) and they were tasty with my beer. I would definitely check this place out if you're looking for late night happy hour (after 10pm in the bar area).
Uyen V.,Hayward  CA,106,11,197,11/6/2011,1.0,"This is not the first time I\'ve ever eaten at BJ\'s. I\'ve actually been here tons of times. But tonight pissed me off enough to actually write a review.Let\'s start off with the little bit of good the night had to offer. The food is always decent. They forget a couple of things here and there  that\'s fine  its a busy place. Our waitress/waiter always brings it out later. Usually super friendly staff.We wanted a booth  but they gave us a table so asked if we could wait for the booth and they obliged. We waited FOREVER. The girl at the front desk was too busy texting and looking at her nails to really pay attention. She offered us two separate booths at the bar. Wtf? We are ONE party. Why would we sit at a loud ass bar  at two separate booths. Luckily her coworker sees a booth open up and points it out and directs us to it. That girl deserves 5 stars  but our waitress fucked that up.So on to the best part of the night. Our waitress Jessica. If I could take a picture of her to warn all other patrons I would. Let\'s be frank  the girl shouldn\'t work in this industry if she hates her job so much. We sat down  she came over and asked what drinks we would like to start off with  I asked if I could order the appetizers  she ignores me and asks my friend at the end of the table what he\'d like to drink. When she gets to me  she asks me  ""The great beginnings right?"" with so much attitude that I almost said no and got up and left.After that  she brings us out our food. I had a midori sour and my friend took a sip. I can understand you have to card everyone  but you can talk to people like they\'re actual people. My friend didn\'t have ID on her so Jessica very rudely said ""DON\'T SIP THAT ANYMORE."" Um okay. Understandable. You\'re doing your job. But how about you don\'t need to be so fucking rude.Now for the topping on the sundae. As we were finishing up our meal  she put the check on the table and KEPT checking on it. Uh  if it looks like we\'re not done  maybe  we aren\'t fucking done. So we pay cash  bill is about $117  we pay about $121  fitting tip for shitty service in my opinion. I usually tip 10-15% so this was a low one for me  but I was pissed. As we were leaving  she yells at us ""Thanks for the 4$ tip  I worked my butt off"" Uh  what  the  fuck? I gotta give it to her for making sure she was a bitch the whole night through. Consistency is key right? Tried to leave a complaint  but we were told that the general manager wouldn\'t be back til Wednesday. I hope he/she likes getting bitched out early in the morning."
Keeper K.,Milpitas  CA,0,14,7,3/22/2014,1.0,Spouse's birthday and was forced to go there against my wishes. Horrible service even per BJ's standards. Missed the meal for my spouse while serving everyone else.My drink had a weird taste  desert never came and so on. Total Disaster.Hope that summarizes it.
Steve C.,Fremont  CA,99,115,24,1/4/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,"Ok  I have to give credit where credit is due! BJ\'s Brewery & Restaurant at their Newark/Fremont location has improved significantly. I don\'t know if they started listening to their Yelp reviews but I was pleasantly surprised and amazed at the quality of food and service. Their onsite management should be proud of taking a lackluster chain and turning it into something they should be proud of.We were invited to go for New Years Day and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger and it was darn good. Now it wasn\'t has great as Val\'s Burgers in Hayward  but the combination of the Burger  Steak Fries  Full Bar and the exceptional service has given it a 5 star rating in my book. My entire table was raving about the meals and the service and all of us said ""We would be back"".I typically say  eat local  and I would recommend you go back and try BJ\'s again if you didn\'t have a good experience the first time."
Jessica P.,Fremont  CA,93,3,25,8/24/2014,5.0,5 stars ONLY with Maria. Otherwise all stars only for happy hour prices not service. Some guy is usually running around the floor  he works hard and I don't blame him  it's staffing. Except the time he was serving my friends and was absolutely rude; so hassled he gave water and never came back and then told them off... Seriously not THIER fault but I'm trying to be nice... But Maria is the only good server I've ever had... Food is consistent and good just not exceptional
Jenny N.,San Diego  CA,583,465,329,9/14/2012,3.0,A chill place to drink beer and munch on appetizers. Love the happy hour times :) had to wait 30-45 for our pizza and when they brought it out.. It was cold and stale .. Complained. Got a new one. And got it for FREE :) so that was cool.
Adam S.,San Ramon  CA,1,32,4,9/17/2014,1.0,I went here on 9 13 2014. My date and I ordered the calarme. It was so bad we both got sick at the same time.  We spoke with the manager and after fighting with him he removed the appetizer.   This was a let down.  I and my friends family and Co workers will hear the nightmare my date and I had.  Come on guys we spend on average 60 dollars when we visit.  You really think a 10 dollar plate is worth a terrible customer experience.  With so many options why fight the customer?
Laura B.,Oceanside  CA,0,9,,10/14/2014,5.0,My husband and I decided to stop at BJs for dinner while on vacation. Our server Taylor  brought our drinks to us right away- I couldn't make a decision what I wanted off of the menu  so Taylor recommended the grilled chicken pasta and it was absolutely delicious. Good choice!! She checked on us attentively and we finished our dinner off with a pizookie. Yum. Thanks again!
Malinda R.,Hayward  CA,37,45,75,7/20/2014,2.0,Food wasn't worth the price. Nice staff  but all of my silverware and plates were dirty. We went to a BJ in Oregon state and it was great. But I will never return here again. $60 wad too much. They replaced the silverware with more dirty silverware  I cleaned them in the ice water before I used them.
Cindy T.,San Jose  CA,115,1120,468,10/8/2010,4.0,I usually visit the BJ's in Cupertino or at Oakridge mall and this new location didn't disappoint. Since parking is horrible at Cupertino and Oakridge  you won't have trouble finding a parking spot at this location because they are the only one in business in the plaza since Mervyn's has been closed for months. This location is really nice  due to the fact that it is quite new. The wait wasn't too bad for dinner on a Saturday. Service and staff was on par. This is an awesome place for accommodating huge groups (20+ people) because they have big dining rooms. I love their buffalo chicken wings and their thai shrimp lettuce wraps are to die for! So yummy. Their deep dish pizzas are quite delicious  too! Plus  they have pizoookies! Great spot to hang out and down brewskys.
marie t.,Newark  CA,1,26,24,8/15/2015,1.0,Sat for 15 minutes while watching the staff argue about who is supposed to serve us. No water or drinks just menus from the hostess. Amazing  one girl just stood around avoiding looking at us obviously not busy but not wanting to serve us. Another waiter finally came by and tried to get us some service since it wasn't his station. We come here once in awhile and it's not usually like this. Disappointing!
Ranjeeta R.,Fremont  CA,0,24,,12/22/2014,1.0,If I could give less than 1  then I would have. Horrible  horrible service. Servers don't even bother clearing up dirty appetizer plates before serving the main course. Servers don't show up for long periods of time. I can't emphasize enough on how bad the service is now. It wasn't so the first year after it opened. Food was better then too. Fries are cold. Food that's no longer warm to barely warm gets served and honestly it doesn't even taste good like it used to anymore. Waste of time  energy and money to go to this restaurant now. Last few visits to this restaurant has been just terrible and I used to go almost weekly to this place in the past. Not anymore for sure. Don't waste your time and money at this place.
Edward L.,Milpitas  CA,142,18,393,7/18/2010,3.0,Typical BJ's establishment. Great for parties  but be prepared to WAIT in long lines during dinner times. Reason for this is that there are very few BJ's up in NorCal. On a saturday 6pm  took about 45 minutes. If you like alcohol  you can always wait at the bar. Don't forget it's a family restaurant  so only 3 shots an hour so you don't puke on a kid.Friendly SERVICE and decent food. Usually get the pizzas here  but honestly their pizza is similar to Pizza Hut. Deep dish pan pizza with lots of oil to make it crispy  which is my favorite type of pizza. Unfortunately it's also x2 the price of The Hut. You should come to BJs if you want to pay for the atmosphere and watch sports on the big screen. Food is typical of normal American family restaurants.Fun TRIVIA  this place is located in a plaza which consists of only a Mervyn's and a BJs. Lots of construction panels just plastered with EAT AT BJs. All the old stores here have closed. I'm guessing they moved across the street to the real plaza.
Yogesh P.,Fremont  CA,9,8,,4/1/2014,5.0,My best hangout place with my buddies. Beers beers beers and the hot wings. This place gets crowded all the time.
Dina I.,Menifee  CA,5,25,10,5/29/2014,2.0,"No one greeted us.  The manager came by our table with an attitude. The ""security"" is a creep that stands arounds being inappropriate and getting paid for it. I usually love coming to this restaurant  but never again to this location!!!"
Richard L.,San Leandro  CA,0,8,,3/29/2015,2.0,Went to BJ's. (Not our first visit.) Current wait staff  and kitchen staff need training and to pay attention to detail. Will give another chance  but that is it. It would be a shame if quality of service does not improve.
Jenny M.,San Leandro  CA,37,33,3,5/24/2013,3.0,I only come here for their selection of beers. I love Gulden Drak Food is ok
Lucy D.,Milpitas  CA,485,782,1812,12/30/2011,4.0,BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse combines new American cuisines with several other different cultures. They are known for there beers and there appetizers are simple delicious. If its your birthday they give you a free piziooke.ProsAtmosphere: The area itself is large and open so you don't feel at all cramped inside a restaurant. The perimeter of the restaurant is surrounded by flat screen tv's showing sport shows to give it a sports bar feel. The added decorations and coloration of the restaurant adds a nice touch as well. Food: The food tasted pretty good with a large variety to choose from. They also have a large selection of alcoholic drinks as well to go nicely with an appetizer. Birthdays: They give you a free pazooki on your birthday so come by if you want something free for your birthday. Parking: The parking for this place is huge so parking is simple. Location: its located near other shopping strips and food area so a prime place to go grab food and do a little shopping as well. ConsCrowded: It gets pretty crowded here during prime time around 7:00 PM. Wait time is usually 30 to 45 minutes during peak hours. Price: The pricing of the food seems a little off. The quality of the food compared to the price your paying for it doesn't seem to add up. The food is good but not necessarily worth the price.Overall this BJ's on Mowry is a nice place to dine out. The large parking with good food quality is great. Come before the peak hours to avoid the crowd and you'll find it a pretty good spot to dine out.
Tiffany B.,Oakland  CA,49,14,4,6/21/2012,4.0,Wow was it worth the wait.... Tried going in LA... Had to wait over hr so we left. Found they had one near us... The service is on point!!! And the food was Soooo good. So many selections. The drink wasn't bad although they didn't have Ciroc which is why I'm giving them a 4. Will def be going back real soon to try something else. Also loved that there are tv's everywhere!!
Justin M.,Newark  CA,2,18,,8/22/2014,4.0,Food here is consistently good  my wife and I have celebrated a few anniversaries here. Not too pricey and great selection. of food and drinks. can get a bit crowded  so if you're looking g for a quiet evening I recommend take-out. If you aren't traveling far the food quality doesn't suffer at all  although you may have to wait longer than the quote time for your order.
Ron O.,Fremont  CA,50,20,1,4/20/2013,3.0,Thus far  waited 30 minutes for a 15 minute wait. It seems call ahead doesn't do anything for you. Which is bad for me  because I have four hungry kids waiting to eat.Luckily  the food and service made the evening acceptable.
Hannah M.,Fremont  CA,2,37,2,5/26/2014,5.0,This review is for the bar top only! I have to say the bartenders at this establishment are on point! Cory And Anthony are so attentive and make some amazing cocktails! I had a great time sitting at their bar top. I would advise people to try an sit at the bar if it available  service in the dining room can be very disappointing. All in all I was happily surprised by the service at the bar and I hope they keep it up!
Rosario G.,Fremont  CA,0,8,3,1/30/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,I absolutely love the restaurant and decided to try the take out   not impressed . I called ahead and placed my order with someone who seemed annoyed which annoyed me   she made me feel very rushed and I wasn't sure that she got my order right . (Which she didn't ) When I arrived to pay there were two cashiers   the person who called me forward to take me next wasn't able to take my payment . Instead I had to wait while money from another customer was exchanged directly in front of me . A customer who had arrived after me . Why call me forward and then tell me you can't take my money but you take the customer behind me ? Then when I was able to pay the girl was extremely rude when giving me my change and when I asked for a receipt she made a big show as if I was putting her out . And to top it off my order wasn't correct and I felt it was poorly prepared   I made the mistake of getting home first before I checked my food . My takeout experience wasn't what I was expecting and I doubt I'll do it again.
Ranika M.,San Ramon  CA,16,11,,7/13/2014,5.0,Bartender Sergio is awesome. The service is great  fast and efficient. We had a big group and they catered to all our needs. Even after we had a few drinks. The lighting is a little dim and the floors were slippery but overall it was a great experience. We will definitely be coming back again!
Gator R.,Hayward  CA,1,36,2,12/25/2012,2.0,"One star would be a better rating but I\'ll be nice and give them two. I ordered the pork chops lunch special ( in reality it should be called the pork ""chop"" special as I only received one lean baby size pork chop). It was accompanied by some greens that appeared to have been frozen for a long period of time as they were tasteless. A few buddies ordered the personal pizzas. By their facial expressions  they were probably wondering if it was DiGiorno\'s. Staff was friendly and drinks were poured in a timely manner. I will only return to this BJs if taco bell is closed for renovations."
Jamie V.,Milpitas  CA,12,62,72,11/7/2010,4.0,They've got great food  especially desserts. I highly recommend the great white pizza and any pizookies (remember  you can ask to switch up the ice cream flavors). As for their service  I have yet to have any problems with any of the waiters.Looking to grab a drink? They don't have the greatest happy hour specials  but the drinks are okay.
Daniel D.,Concord  CA,826,461,314,12/12/2011,3.0,I came here for a friend's birthday dinner.. with a 10pm reservation  you would think service would be attentive.. meh!B -- S-- Plenty of parking  all the stores in this area have closed (RIP Circuit City)-- Right off the freeway and across from Newpark mall-- Restaurant size: about average/same as other locations-- 2nd newest  Concord is the newest location-- NEW glutten-free options :) at all locationsOnce you've been to BJ's  they're all about the same with the exception of service. That's where they make or break themselves at these chain restaurants. So I don't deduct anything from BJ's given that I actually have had a good experience at all of the locations in the bay area and even in Sacramento.Food was the same  I was glad to have a calzone and a ceasar salad. I also ordered a glutten-free pizookie which is totally awesome! Definitely a great alternative to the normal options. *House Salad (side note): I've always noticed that the house salads are trash which I mentioned to the server. She told me that they make them the night before and that's why they aren't that good. The caesar and other salads  however  are made fresh to order! So if you wonder why the house salads suck like I did  now you know!My biggest gripe with servers is lack of attention and filling up my damn water. I know it's a hard thing to ask for. We had a big party but I'm a thirsty guy and no water means no bueno for me. Otherwise our server was fine. Some of my party complained about her being rude  but I didn't really notice.I would still consider this location very convenient if I lived in the area and if you want to grab a beer and watch a game  this is a perfect spot to go.
Monika S.,Newark  CA,0,6,89,7/3/2015,5.0,Love coming to BJ's! Overall  I think the service is alright. The reception and waiters are usually friendly. The food is tasty- love the appetizer platter they have (can't remember the name). The only problem I have had was waiting for the waiters to come (ordering food  paying bill  etc.)
Allie A.,Union City  CA,121,49,13,9/8/2012,5.0,The only complaint that I have is that it's always dark & busy.. Other than that this place is great. The staff is amazing  I've never had a bad experience here!
Linda N.,San Francisco  CA,412,302,146,1/2/2012,2.0,Server was 10 min late on our water. Food was also taking longer than expected. I already experienced shitty quality at BJ's but I went here since it was close to the mall.I have to say their buffalo chicken wontons were good but 3 wontons is kinda little. Their seared ahi tuna was good but didn't taste fresh. Tasted like it was out of a can or the freezer. My main meal was the unlimited soup and salad. Their house salad was drenched with too balsamic vinaigrette(sp?) and their chicken tortilla soup was really good.My friend's flatbread pizza was bland and I had to use ranch dip to add some flavor into it. Their meals are EH but I usually ONLY go here for their pizookie. That's the only thing they're good at.
Terri L.,San Jose  CA,28,60,3,7/20/2011,2.0,I really don't know why some of my friends always choose to go to BJ's for group dinners because I think they aren't the greatest  other than their Pizookies. We were in a large group  but I didn't think it was okay at all for our server to come sit with us for a bit and tell us how she has been getting crappy sections and haven't been making a lot of money. Are you trying to make us feel sorry for you and get more money out of us for your mediocre service? Well it's not working. Sorry!
D.wight L.,East Bay  CA,494,890,1538,7/29/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Okay enough of the corporate restaurant bashing. I'll play nice today. Key word: today. So here's a quick congenial update  before I change my mind.This place ain't all that bad. Been back many times and I keep getting more and more surprised on the decency of some of the items. Pork Chops...not bad  NitWit Belgian White Beer...pretty damn good  NY Steak with giant baked potato that could feed a village in a third world country...I hate to admit it  good.So there it is.Come here if you want that proper Steak & a BJ experience!I mean Steak & a BJ's beer experience. Ooopsies.
Holly S.,Hayward  CA,0,2,,8/22/2014,4.0,The food was a little slow and once it arrived it was dry and cold  but our server Barbra was just the sweetest. She was so attentive and had a genuine interest in providing excellent service. Definitely saved the experience for me and my family.
Kannan V.,Kansas City  MO,9,11,,1/6/2013,4.0,Good find for me. hand-tossed Buffalo chicken pizza was just awesome! We ordered marsala chicken pasta but that wasnt great. The waitress was very polite and swapped our order without any questions. Great service! Jeremiah red Irish pale ale is a must try. I loved it!
Jack D.,Fairfield  CA,0,4,,9/2/2014,3.0,The dessert menu is so irresistible but for someone who is on a budget  this is definitely not my go to place. Overall  if I didn't have a gift card I wouldn't be coming here again.
Deborah A.,Queen Creek  AZ,0,44,,12/20/2012,2.0,This would have been a three star for me but I have to say waiting an hour after placing your order makes even the best of places lose points with me. We were seated right away and it was 1:30. We placed out orders and then waited. When we finally called the waiter over he said our meal would be right up there was a mistake in the type of bread they used for my friend's sandwich. I really think he should have come over and let us know there had been a delay and what it was caused from. My flat-bread pizza was nice but not warm and my friend's sandwich was luke warm  The bathroom was clean and well kept and I always find that refreshing. Menus were sticky and really should have been cleaned off. I feel the wait staff could handle the long waits a bit better.

Steven H.,San Francisco  CA,82,25,10,7/18/2011,2.0,You know  it's such a nice idea  and they try so hard....and the cream soda and root beer on tap just plain rock....but it's just not quite all there.I know it's a chain and it follows the brewpub/sports bar model  but they could do so much more. First  hire someone who knows how to train young people to wait tables on a large floor. Keeping the hands full and focusing on the moment is everything. Running back to the kitchen because you forgot a key piece of the meal (the cheese ordered on the sandwich?) or an incorrect entree  that far away to the kitchen means the other entrees are cold when the waiter returns....not excusable. Must focus on the task at hand. The floor is too big.And how do these errors happen so consistently in the first place? We have tried and tried again (the clam chowder is pretty good  and we like the appetizers) but we're always sending something back to be replaced.They need to pull it together  work on quality control and maybe turn down the TVs one notch (not on big game nights  but random nights with football reruns and soccer and all the *different* channels are ALL loud?) and then it might be okay.
Michelle B.,Fremont  CA,41,36,5,12/17/2012,2.0,Went for dinner with my husband the other night. Our wait time for a table was about 15 minutes  not bad. Ordered soup/salad and dinner. Dinner came after about 30-40 minutes. The shrimp skewer my husband ordered was overcooked (he ordered two and they only brought one-had to cook that and bring it separately later) and our soup and salad came AFTER our dinner. Really? By the time my husband ate his soup it was cold. Mind you  we had to ask the person who brought our dinner (not our waiter) where our salad and soup were...Then the manager came over and apologized but did nothing with our bill other than to say sorry. We have been to the BJ's in Dublin and the food/atmosphere/service was very good  so we thought we would try the one in Fremont. We will spend our $$ somewhere else. Food was ok but not good enought to go back.
Melissa H.,San Jose  CA,179,39,16,10/30/2011,1.0,"I tried calling when I needed to set up a farewell dinner for a friend. I called on a Thursday morning for RSVP Friday for roughly 30 people. I was put on hold  not asked to be  but just put on hold for a manager. The manager came on & when I inquired about the RSVP  he smirked & with attitude said  ""wait  you want a table tomorrow night  for 30? Friday? And you\'re calling me Thursday??""I didn\'t need to deal with his smart ass remarks  so I responded by telling him we can take our money elsewhere. I could do with out his rude comments!!We ended up going to Jack\'s Brewing Company in the Hub. It was a MUCH better choice!!"
A B.,Fremont  CA,0,3,,8/2/2015,2.0,Had 1/2 a dinner there tonight. You ask 1/2? I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and the menu says the mahi mahi was glazed. I sent it back because it was not glazed. It came back still not glazed. I like fish but this fish did not taste good it wasn't seasoned and needed the glaze. But that wasn't all went to the ladies the trash bin was overflowing and the toilet paper rolls from the stalls were strewn across the floor. Lovely dinner....not.
Michelle G.,Union City  CA,3,5,,5/8/2014,2.0,Boooooo this place. The quality of their food has dropped so much  especially their happy hour foods. Their service is consistently terrible (and I mean for years). I used to love their pizzas (the great white)  but the last few times I've had it...yuck.One good thing I can say is their pizookies are still one of my favorite desserts  especially the oreo pizookie. Yum! Fun environment  but don't expect much.
Farah J.,Pleasanton  CA,11,116,27,5/14/2012,5.0,Great place!BUT CALL AHEAD! IT TENDS TO BE 45 MIN WAIT FOR 2! OUTRAGEOUS.
Jason H.,Raleigh  NC,2,92,4,5/5/2015,4.0,Food was good  though I had worked a 17 hour day so that level of hunger has to be taken into account. We had a pleasant waiter but based on what me and my work mate noticed it wasn't that he was inattentive just perhaps overbooked. We sat at a table in the bar. That was uncomfortably close to another table. I just found it an I enjoyable overly crowded atmosphere it's why I will give it a 4... It was good food but not the type of place you leave having had an experience you want to repeat.
Peaches C.,Sunnyvale  CA,339,294,43,6/6/2011,4.0,My girlfriends and I are addicted to the strawberry mojito here. It is aweeeessssooooommmeee! This BJ's seems a lot less crowded than the BJ's at oakridge  still crowded but not as bad. I've been here twice in the last month and can't complain on either the food or service. I know my girlfriends and I will be definitely coming back to our strawberry mojitos :)Oh and the ahi poke is amazing.
Laura D.,Fremont  CA,16,35,2,4/30/2014,3.0,Their food is really good especially the chicken tortilla soup. You can never go wrong with the Buffalo chicken pizza. The only thing that sucks is there service. Always slow and they make a lot mistakes on the check.
Ami P.,Fremont  CA,20,16,,8/9/2011,2.0,"This place falls right in line with what I expect from any big chain restaurant: Wah wah wah...destination disappointment. The only reason why I even ""ate"" here was because it was the chosen birthday spot for a friend. 1. Let\'s begin with opening the menu and about the 3rd page in  I found that the pages were stuck. I pried them apart and discovered wet  slimy  avocado goop acting as the adhesive. Yuck...I was immediately turned off. Obviously  the menus don\'t get cleaned as frequently as I hoped.  2. The house side salad was around $5...for what?! A plate sprinkled with a sparse array of lettuce  shredded carrots  2 cherry tomatoes  and crumbled  bottom- of- the- bag croutons. I\'m not cheap  by any means  but I\'m not stupid with my money either. This salad was 100% a rip off. A Fresh Express Salad kit from Safeway for $3 would have been a supermodel salad compared to this. 3. The Margherita Flatbread was what I decided on for my meal. I chose it b/c the picture and the description seduced me. I saw words like ""fresh"" and ""sweet"". Deception!! ! What came out was something that looked as if a teenager would have heated up as an after school snack out of a frozen box. There was NO fresh mozerella from what I could see/taste  and the sauce had a weird chemical flavor reminiscent of the janitorial supply closet back in high school. 4. The white peach and mint tea was undrinkable. The instant it touched my tongue  my tastebuds rejected it. I was anticipating a slightly sweet  peachy flavor laced with mint...what I experienced was loud  sour  syrup flavored water. The redeeming factor of this place was our waitress. She was very friendly (although it was transparent that her speech was rehearsed and insincere) and she had a smile on her face the entire time.  I will only return to BJ\'s if I have to due to another celebratory gathering."
Ed G.,Oakland  CA,0,17,1,5/25/2014,2.0,Ate here tonight with my date. The service was ok. The food  however  was about as bland as I've ever had. This BJs doesn't hold a candle to the BJs in Cupertino. EVERYTHING was bland...wings  potato skins  salads. Even the dessert was bland. How can one screw up dessert?!! BJs Newark - come for the beer but say no to the food!
Dorothy F.,New York  NY,352,181,67,5/11/2009,4.0,"Training for a marathon is brutal. Not only do I have to run 5-6 times a week but every week I have to complete a long run that ultimately totals 22 miles to ready me for the actual 26.2 mile race. I won\'t bore you with the agonizing details but I will say this for the sake of all the eye-rollers  naysayers  and people who ask me why I do it: SO I CAN PIG OUT GUILT-FREE. Makes sense now right? My latest day of gluttony was this Saturday after a body numbing 22 mile run in San Francisco. How I managed to crawl into and out of my shower  put both legs into a pair of leggings  then walk the rest of the night after my run is nothing short of a miracle. Given our miraculous feat my running buddies and I decided it was time to treat our bodies to a different kind of punishment. The kind that involves eating enormous amounts of calories  sugar  fat  calories  sugar  and anything fried. BJ\'s Brew house was just the place we were looking for. Now it\'s by no means a hole in the wall dive  but they serve up some very satisfying bar fare and comfort food in a surprisingly sleek and modern setting. Our party of 6 started with a medley of appetizers ( in other words more than we shoud have): -onion strings - thin slices of perfectly salted & battered onion -chicken wings- the buffalo sauce was drizzled on top along w/ranch for a less messy but still tasty buffalo-style wing -Santa Fe spring rolls- light but satisfying w/ a great blend of veggies and meat -artichoke dip - creamy  savory and kinda greasy YUM Since we loaded up on appetizers I decided to keep my entree \'light\' by ordering a thin crust appetizer-size pizza. I\'m partial to thin crusts and a huge fan of basil and this pie had both  along with tomato and sausage so I couldn\'t really find anything wrong with it. I also snuck a few bites of their parmesan-crusted chicken and mashed potatoes. Good flavor but very rich and filling ( probably why my BF had 1/3 of it leftover). Overall I was very pleased with their food. Their menu isn\'t breaking new ground but the food is hearty and satisfying. After our many plates were cleared came the inevitable question: ""do you guys have room for dessert?"" Clearly our server had no idea. Without a moment\'s hesitation we chose 2 orders of their signature dessert. The PAZOOKIE. And oh my pazookie that stuff was good. Despite the strange name it\'s a simple combo of cookie and ice-cream. But BJ\'s has clearly perfected this classic pairing. The cookie was warm  the batter chewy  and the chocolate chunks slightly melted and topped with a generous serving of vanilla ice-cream. The pazookie was clearly the highlight of the night but service was also good and our waiter was upbeat and attentive. Now you clearly don\'t have to run a marathon to eat at BJ\'s but it\'s the only surefire way to enjoy their food and Pazookies  without any guilt."
Angie C.,Mountain View  CA,43,152,1,3/31/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"Another 4 stars thanks to having ANOTHER Saturday night snafu with the call-ahead seating. I called in at 7 pm  expecting a wait. As such  I was not surprised when I was told to arrive at 8 pm.We arrived at 8 and gave the name  mentioned we had call-ahead seating (there were two of us). The hostess handed us a pager and told us that\'d be 30 minutes. I told her I did not expect a wait with call-ahead seating. She assured me that the call-ahead list was so long that the wait would still be 30 minutes. I told her that was unacceptable and asked to speak to a manager. As soon as the ""M"" word escaped my lips  the pager buzzed and we were ushered to our seats.Thankfully  we once again had wonderful service. Our server  Shane laughed and joked with us. At one point  my friend joked about getting brownie points for her birthday - and Shane ordered a birthday brownie as a surprise. He was on top of things and made the experience truly enjoyable.We spoke to the same manager  Brenda  who recognized us and thanked us again for the feedback. She told us how glad she was that we\'d come back by  assured us that the front end waiting system is something they\'re still working on improving.So be forewarned - you may run into minor annoyance with the hosts. But once you get past the gatekeepers  this place is pretty awesome."
S C.,Boise  ID,0,2,,7/29/2015,1.0,"Understaffed or uncaring? I\'m really not sure. I\'ve noticed a steep decline in ""service"" at local restaurants in recent months  but BJ\'s is the winner of the worst service award. I\'ve dined at BJ\'s once each month for the past 3 months and nothing has improved. Service staff is unattentive  food delivery takes way too long  food is either cold or ill prepared. Nothing speaks quality. Dining out isn\'t cheap  and because of that the expectation from customers for good service is high. Sadly I won\'t be returning despite the great beer selection. Worse yet  I\'ve had friends tell me that service at BJ\'s in Pleasanton and in San Mateo are just as bad."
Jason T.,San Lorenzo  CA,8,24,2,1/2/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Hm. I can drink now. The beer is good. Getting a little older I've learned to not expect service not necessarily advertised. Sit to eat and drink-- A-okay. Food-- Okay. What do you expect from a chain. IT is your cheesecake etc. Beer-- Good. Night-- chill  for the most part. Loud-- Yes. Dark-- Yes. Floor Slippery-- sometimes and I don't know why. Restroom-- Clean  it too is dark-- you might not look as cool as you might think. Overall. Eh. It is Fremont  where else do I go and not spend a journey's time?
Thamina S.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,0,13,,7/8/2015,1.0,I'm actually sad with this location. It takes forever to recieve our food  they need to have more waiters on the clock or else they will run out of business soon. We ordered potato skins as our app and we specificed no meat on it because of religious reasons and when it got to our table  lo and behold there was meat. It took them awhile but when they finally gave us our app our entree had arrived. My sister ordered a cajun pasta and believe me there was nothing cajun about it  it tasted just like bland spaghetti with ragu sauce. I ordered a small pizza and it was barely even warm. I would say our wait for our food was 30-40 minutes  which is unacceptable. I can't come here anymore.
Tuyet N.,San Jose  CA,129,100,4,6/28/2013,1.0,This is not the place to try pasta. I had the shrimp scampi. The noodles were dry and the shrimp was bland. The server never asked us how our food was. I've worked in the service industry before so I still tipped over 20%. It's not the sever's fault the food was bad  but he should've asked about the food.
Jo-Ann G.,Brentwood  CA,59,18,34,6/2/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,We celebrated our twin daughters baptism here last 4/28th. We have about 80 guests and everything was just perfect. The service was excellent. The manager and servers that day were very attentive  all the drinks were served and refilled quickly. They made sure that we didn't ran out of food; even towards the end  they kept sending out more appetizers that most of our guests took some home. They also let us use an extra long table for our own cake  cookies & candy bar; and set up our projector too.Thank you for the excellent service  we'll definitely do another special event in the future.
Lynn B.,Hayward  CA,2,38,,7/3/2013,1.0,"I wish I would of read these reviews before I went there. The service was really bad.We were sat down pretty fast and our server took our order very quickly. Sounds great so far! Took about 10 or 15 mins to bring our drinks. After that never saw him again. The table next to us who came the same time we did got their appetizers and salads and we were still siting there with our ice waters (They had a different server). My poor son had something floating in his drink so he didn\'t even have that. Not one time did our server come and check on us. After more than 40 mins I started gettting really mad. I told my son hope our salads come pretty soon so we can eat them before our dinner comes out.A few mins later a guy comes out with 2 plates and comes to our table. He was wearing a chefs hat ( I think he was the cook.) and put our dinners on the table. I told him that we never received our salads yet. The cook said that he would have the manager come and talk to us. Out of no where our server shows up and said that there was some kind of ""glitch"" and he would go get our salads. When he brought the salads  he messed up on mine. He said he would go get me another one but I told him to forget it. The thing that really makes me mad is I think our dinners were sitting because they were not very hot.This was my first and last time there.......:("
GuyFawkes S.,Milpitas  CA,0,16,,6/9/2013,2.0,While driving home from work  I was craving some feticinni alfredo with broccoli and grilled chicken for dinner and maybe save some for lunch the next day. I didn't have the number to call ahead so I parked in the To Go parking spot and called the number posted. When someone answered  I said I wanted to order To Go. I was asked my name which I answered. I was asked two more times and I answered the same each time. I got annoyed  why wouldnt he believe me or was he confused that I already ordered and was here to pick-up?I waited for 35 minutes in my car with the air conditioner on which was not a problem. I saw how busy they were by all the people coming in and out of the restaurant. Once I received my food  I excitedly drove home to dine on my favorite meal from BJ's. I ate 30% of the meal and closed it up for tomorrow. A few hours later I got drowsy and nauseous. I vomited out the meal and tossed the leftovers in the garbage. I'm not sure if I want to return to this restaurant.
Constance D.,San Leandro  CA,348,387,185,2/12/2012,2.0,I came here with my boyfriend to meet some friends for dinner and since our friends were going to be a while  we grabbed some seats at the bar. Our bartender was super amazing; very friendly and nice. Once our friends arrived  we were able to score a table  since they seemed to know a host  and were sat right away. Our server though  I forget this name  was not very good at all. He barely came by to see us and left one of our friends water glass empty for 3/4 of the meal. The food was very good  for a crazy busy restaurant. I'd go back if friends would want to go but it's not first on my places to go.
Hailey K.,Mountain View  CA,205,44,99,7/17/2011,3.0,Avocado roll every time! That is a must try  though it is not that unique. It is a good spot to chill with friends and have a relaxing night. All the BJs are huge so it would be hard for those boys and girls make really quick services but I can tell they tried their best. Also  the buffalo chicken pizza was fantastic. The good thing is that they use ranch but not blue cheese! That's what real buffalo style should be.Then Pizookie time. We nailed the order by getting half Chocolate Chip cookie and half Red Velvet Cookie with White Chocolate Chips. The combo was awesome and the Red Velvet cookie better masked the poor quality of the ingredients. After the dessert  we had some wine and beers. I would say the drinks are not that impressive but after all  it is a chain restaurant so it is quite understandable.
John G.,Union City  CA,119,83,7,4/9/2012,3.0,The food here is okay. I only really come for the mini pizzas. The Buffalo chicken  Cheeseburger  and Favorite pizza are pretty good. They started skimping on the Ahi Poke app though. I remember it being more than enough  but now it's become a one person portion.The beer here is also ok. Their house brews are just ok. You can find better versions of each beer somewhere else.Even though it's not a house brew  Chimay Blue is the only real beer that makes my mouth water here.I'ts a good spot to watch games  so many TVs and there's that kind of huge one right over the bar.
Stawan K.,San Jose  CA,1,147,,3/15/2014,4.0,Love this place for their variety of beers and drinks. Lively place with some great options to eat specially the flat breads and appetizer menu. Great for a weekday party with office crowd. Always crowded and fun when a good game is on.
Mary Jane P.,Hayward  CA,142,458,166,3/10/2012,4.0,Came here late night after going to San Jose to see cirque du soleil totem. we were seated promptly. We asked the waitress her suggestions and the guys in our group ordered exactly what she suggested. They loved it! It was a half cheeseburger half 5 meat pizza. We also ordered for appetizers hot wings  tuna tar tar and shrimp wraps. All were Delicious!! I ordered the blacked salmon. It was so good I am craving it and cant wait to go back......hmmmmm maybe I can figure out their seasonings used to make the rub.....naw I'll just steal some!! hahaha
Mary G.,Fremont  CA,0,33,,7/23/2015,4.0,great food. Get in before 7pm other wise you will waiting 45min-1hour
Manish P.,Santa Clara  CA,8,55,,3/14/2015,5.0,Always love going to BJ's - no matter which location! They have huge variety of items to choose from  portions are very generous and they've got some really good beers -- not to mention their yummy Pizzokie :)
Anita C.,Hong Kong,190,370,682,2/1/2010,2.0,Pluses: Packed after work  but wait wasn't too long for seats. Jambalaya was good and so was the pizza (I think we just go the BJ combo.) Pazuki was alright (a bit sweet for me  but not bad - basically 2 scoops of ice cream on top of a warm chocolate chip cookie).MINUS: Service was bad! Waitress sounded normal and nice  but wasn't even paying attention to us as we were talking to her. Or check in on us and walk away before we asked her something. And she would leave and not come back for a loooong time. Not sure if it's worth coming back here because of this service.Seems like the servers are chatting and mingling in the back  because 4-5 of them would come out of the kitchen at the same time to go to their tables...
Malia W.,Tacoma  WA,118,343,362,12/11/2011,4.0,Came here this weekend to spend some time with old friends. We found a booth in the bar area. VERY packed on a Saturday night. We ordered two pitchers of Hefeweizer  one mojito and four appetizers (3 from the mini appetizer menu) Came up to about $70. The waitress came around a lot asking if we needed anything. However  when we ordered beer or asked for the check it took a fairly long time. But it may have slipped her mind since they were pretty busy. Overall  like all the other BJ's I've been to. Good food and good beer :)They had lots of parking since the restaurant is in between what was mervyns and circuit city.
Nick F.,East Bay  CA,111,796,106,4/20/2009,4.0,"I\'ve been to other BJ\'s in the past and have been to this location three-times for lunch and one-time for appetizers/drinks last Thursday. (Thanks Chris for the great service!)Let\'s start with what happened last night...I\'m not a beer drinker but my friend kept raving about a few of the beers they had  like this Pumpkin Ale whatever it\'s called? So  I figured what the hell...April 16  2009 will mark the first day in the 31-years of my life that beer would touch my lips. We both ordered two ""Taster Sets "" which were four - 5oz glasses (See the pic I uploaded). I picked the one that was preset and she picked a custom set. This was a GREAT way to test if I liked the light - darker stuff. Based on the different beers I tried  I can say that I liked...actually  enjoyed if anything the Pale Blonde. Not too sure if it\'ll make me a beer drinker but  if I ever had to order one  that\'s what I\'d go for.They have a pretty wide selection of menu choices  probably a little too much that you might have a hard time deciding what to order. Their menu is kinda reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory\'s menu  without the advertisement on every other page!  We ordered their sampler appetizer (It has a real name  I just forgot the name of it!) but it came with Spinach & Artichoke Dip  Mozzarella Sticks  Santa Fe Spring Rolls and Avocado Egg Rolls. I think it was about $13.95  not too bad. We both got a salad  I absolutely LOVE their Wedge Salad...it has to be the dressing I think! Overall it was a great night.The other couple times I\'ve been here were for lunch. They have some pretty decent lunch specials like a half sandwich with fries and half salad for about $7-$8. I got the California Chicken Club and of course  the Wedge Salad...major yum! They also had a personal pizza and salad for also about the same price  as well as a bunch of other specials.It can get pretty busy there around lunch time so  if you\'re on a 30 or even a 60  plan on a 90! Gotta leave room for some workplace gossip while they prep the food! haha!  But that\'s where they loose 1-star  not many people have the luxury of an extended lunch hour and they don\'t seem to realize the sense or urgency of getting out of there at a decent time. The first time we were there  the manager noticed me constantly checking to see what time it was and eventually comped our meal. Don\'t get any ideas  this was like the 2nd day they were open....and they did improve the 2nd time around! ;)Overall  BJ\'s is a great place for lunch  dinner  happy hour  watching a game  etc.  My only beef is that the plaza where it\'s located at sucks! The only two entrances to reach the restaurant are like ridden with major  major potholes. :/ But  that\'s not their fault...we\'ll blame it on Mervyn\'s for going out of business! haha!"
Will M.,Santa Ana  CA,554,638,2411,6/9/2009,4.0,This is their newest restaurant in the area. I am generally not a fan of chains  but I love BJ's concept of good microbrew and tasty food. I've been eating at my local BJs for about 5 years since they opened  so it was an easy choice to check out this Fremont Newark restaurant. First off  the restaurant is as crowded as a free Molly Cyrus concert during weekends. We drove by on Fri. Night at 6 PM and there were lines of people outside. We returned for lunch at 1:30 PM on Saturday and it was immediate seating. I had their Baslamic Chicken  ($12) very flavorful and moist chicken with small side of greens and dressing and seasoned rice in lieu of mashed potatoes. The chicken was a little sweet with a slight tang  and that glaze onion was yummy. I opted for the cooly named Nitwit White Belgian beer ($6) which is Hefeweizen with tiny bit of coriander and citrus. It was a perfect match. My nephew had their Mediterranean Pizza which he eats with topped with ranch dressing. My brother had the chicken lettuce wraps  always a winner esp. at BJ's. Generally  most of the food their I've tried is quite good and there is enough of it. Their pizzas are excellent with a puffy flavorful crust. Their pastas are good  as are sandwhiches. My favorite item  though  it their version of the Chinese Asian sesame salad. They use napa cabbage instead of lettuce  so the flavor and texture are better than lettuce based salads in my opinion. Lastly  I love their award winning bears  all of them. And they are good about telling you what goes with a certain food in case you don't know. Service was friendly and quick this time. I know this place is nuts during prime time on weekends. This new restaurant is clean and very well put togehter  though loud. Fortunately  they built it right next to a recently abandoned Mervyn's. So although this is a high high traffic area  at least parking isn't a problem right now. Of course  if they put something else like another shop in the ex Mervyns  it could be bad parking wise.They keep advertizing their pizzookie. I've had it  it's yummy. But it's a pschological ploy. They know you'll love their food  and for most restaurants  desserts are a huge money maker. So is coffee and beverages. So if you haven't had enough food  maybe you'll go for their yummy dessert  and that is a good choice. There are other desserts here  too. But being a bigger fan of the Flipino dessert called halo halo  an ice and canned milk and ice cream concoction of preserved and canned fruits and beans  I never quite get to their desserts. We headed elsewhere for that  but they have good food period here.The bill was $46 plus tip. Not bad for a very nice time.
Tung T.,San Leandro  CA,255,148,46,5/18/2011,2.0,Remembered when BJ's was the S!$T? Like when you would travel 25+ miles and wait 30min + for a table to enjoy some good food and ultimately eat their famous pazookie. Well those days are over! BJ's...what happened? I would use to crave their entrees and appetizers but now i am dreaded every time I am forced to go to BJ's. The last time i went with a group of friends for drinks  i tried their snakebite thinking that it would be just as good as Yardhouse's. O boy was I wrong. It was pretty bad beer on top of pretty bad pear cider that had a medicine aftertaste to it. I love beer  but i couldn't even force myself to drink that. For snacks  I shared the Best Beginning appetizer which comprised of spinach dip  avocado rolls  santa fe rolls  and mozzarella sticks. One word: mediocre. O yea and the red velvet pazookie? W T F. Does not taste like red velvet at all. LIARS! This BJ's especially  I think I've only had bad experiences of BJ's at this particular location. But think about it...why do we go to chain restaurants? It is because we hope and think that being a chain  every restaurant should have the same standard. That's what makes chain restaurants so successful. So i have no pity at all  if you are confident enough to open up chain restaurants you better have all of them at the right standards! But besides that  good service is no good if the food sucks. Our waiter  although is very nice. He had a very strong undertone which i did not appreciate. It felt like we were kids and he was just serving us to take our money. Anyways enough rambling  go at your own risk.
Aurora R.,San Jose  CA,9,10,1,5/17/2014,5.0,Came here on a lunch date with my hubby. We were seated quickly. It was nice  clean  cozy. Our server was Jonathan J  he was very perky  polite  and attentive. We will be back.
Sabrina Alexandra L.,Fremont  CA,33,109,18,8/8/2013,3.0,I've finally tried this place out after working in this town for 3 years. The food was excellent and the service was prompt and their drinks were perfect. The only downfall to this place is the wait time. They said during weekdays  the wait time can be up to half an hour to an hour and weekends are 1hr plus. That's the only issue I have with this place but I'll still be coming here for the drinks.
Natasha S.,Fremont  CA,220,179,209,1/19/2012,3.0,ive had very iffy experiences here ... never consistentThis time when we went they forgot my nachos and gave us chips and salsa ... umm wheres my CHEESE!! ugh ... and he never realized what he did ... ummm HELLO!sooo we asked another server that we ordered nachos and this is what we got and then she got the manager who came to us and apologized and said that our nachos will be coming out and that will comped as well as the complimentary chips and salsa that we got instead.yeaaaah i filled up on the chips and salsa and maybe took one bite of the nachos i originally ordered.we also ordered the ahi tuna appetizer ... nom nom nom ... yummy!OVERALL: eh ill go back again probably to try the beer sampler since i need to expand my palette for beer haha
Marevie T.,San Jose  CA,1778,674,26,11/11/2013,4.0,The food is always wonderful at BJs anywhere! I liked the Ahi  the mushrooms appetizer and of course  the beer. MMMMMM.... BEER. Anyway  the host at the front was really upbeat and I was kind of expecting our waitress to be the same  unfortunately not. The only things that were upbeat was her eyelashes  that seemed to keep her eyes open. Lol! Awe I get that its the end of the night  but look a little alive when you're serving DJ's who have to be 100% at odd hours of the night and decided to come in to eat before going out. It's not that bad. Lol
Laila A.,Fremont  CA,0,7,3,5/7/2011,1.0,So here I am trying to enjoy dinner for the First time at this location and what a waste of time. Service wasn't good at all the server seems to be in la la land. I ordered a chicken sandwich with no bacon and what comes on my sandwich? Bacon! She disappeared and didn't check in so I was sitting there wasting my whole lunch away (and the restaurant wasn't even busy!) she finally comes back I ask to have it taken off the bill because now I'm late and need to leave  she offers a box and bring the bill with no box! I have to hunt her down again for a box to pack my other left overs. Won't be coming back anytime soon!
Kass T.,Union City  CA,17,44,39,8/31/2013,3.0,Food and drinks are amazing but their customer services is usually bad. I'm a regular here because I love the pazookies but seriously  most of the time the waiters are moving too fast and forget about the importance of customer service.
Dianne M.,Fremont  CA,41,39,85,2/13/2012,4.0,I love BJs. Ever since it opened  Fremont/Newark had some entertainment late night places to go besides milk tea places. They close at midnight. the Food is great  and the drinks are good. I always order the chicken dishes like chicken parmigiana  crusted chicken something  and the deep dish pizzas are pretty good. The mini pizzas are just as good although not enough toppings like the regular size. The only food that I didn't like here at BJs that I've tried was the fish so far. Taste and texture and dry...did not finish my meal. The Strawberry Blast  I think  is really good with a taste of rum...it's similar to the pina colada and I always order this when I want something with alcohol. The wait can be long  up to an hour  if you come on Friday nights or weekends.
Felicia I.,Newark  CA,71,22,3,10/11/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I left a review before which was terrible but the only reason why I'm leaving a second review is because the waiter I had tonight. BJ's is known for their terrible service but tonight a waiter named Ed was amazing!!! I give that guy 5 stars for his service and hopefully he will get recognized because majority everyone who is a waiter/waitress there sucks. But thank you ed!!!
Skyler W.,Sacramento  CA,97,180,22,3/27/2011,4.0,Happy Hour until 7pm! $1 off beers $2 off all apps and 50% off mini pizzas. This BJ's looks and feels like all of their other restaurants. This restaurant is conveniently located right off of the 880 on Mowry rd. I came here after work on a Thursday night at around 6pm  the place was crowded  but i was able to score a seat at the bar.It was happy hour  so i decided to order some hot wings and a Lagunitas IPA. The wings were magnificent  juicy and slightly crispy . The sauce came on the side  so you are able to control how much heat you really want. The beer was of course ever so delicious. I also ordered the Mini Bruschetta  it was very cheap and really tasty  the pieces of bread were thick  and it tasted similar to their pizza dough.Overall i was very happy with my visit to BJ's  the food was excellent and the service was right there with it  even the other people at the bar were very friendly. Also i was very impressed with their selection of beer  i counted 28 beers on tap!! I will definitely come back here again for some good ol' happy hour eatin and drinkin.
Omar G.,Union City  CA,33,10,,4/20/2011,4.0,BJ's doesn't seem to need a review since it seems everyone has been here! Still  I need to procrastinate so here goes:The food here is always high quality  be it the pizzas  burgers or that awesome runs Poke appetizer. The staff is usually pretty friendly & helpful. The beer  well the beer is ok. I have never been a huge fan of their house beers  but I love the fact that the serve some great guest brews. You'll often find Anderson Valley  Speakeasy  Drake's and other local brews. Also  for the homebrewers  they offer a 10% discount with your AHA card! Almost forgot about the Pizzookie.. can't do that! A freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top... rocks!
cheryl d.,Union City  CA,8,22,32,3/4/2011,2.0,"I usually like ""bj\'s"" but this one just falls flat.2 stars go to the pizookie & chili cheese potato wedges.my pizza was way under cooked  the fact that the veggie toppings tasted raw and temp was barely warm.the wait is ridiculous. the staff is slow at times."
Bill C.,San Ramon  CA,58,549,58,7/2/2009,2.0,This place is average on a good day. Their brewed beers were ok. Although you can tell by the taste and finish  they don't use high end ingredients in the beers. They are cheap  mass produced beers that try to pass as Microbrews. I had there Nutty Brewnette (American Brown Ale) and it was just ok. Not a particularly memorable beer. I ended up switching to Boddingtons. The food was again mass produced. I had a Cuban sandwich burger. It was easy to tell the burger portion had been cooked long ago was was simply kept warm. How hard is it to make a burger tough? I swear I had to chew that burger forever. It wasn't all that good. The dinner salads were pretty plain and boring. The salad missed the nice crisp crunch you'd expect from a salad. Will I be back? Naw  there are plenty of places to get average food.
Nikki C.,East Bay  CA,1791,409,785,1/14/2011,3.0,I've been to several BJ's restaurants and this location quite a few times. The food is decent  service is okay  and happy hour specials aren't the best.HAPPY HOUR4pm to 7pm10pm to closeRaspberry Lemon Drop = 3 stars* tastes pretty good but I prefer a traditional lemon drop.Brewhouse Blonde = 4 stars* my favorite BJ's beer next to the Nutty Brunette. Angel Hair Toscana = 3.5 stars* reasonably priced  large portion  & very similar to TGIF's Bruschetta Chicken Pasta. However  at BJ's you can order it plain  with Chicken or with Shrimp.Spinach & Artichoke Dip = 3 stars* your average dip served w/tortilla chipsCrispy Calamari = 3 stars* a bit too greasy for my taste but pretty good nonetheless.Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza = 4 stars* considered an appetizer but can easily be ordered as an entree. This is my favorite happy hour special.Pizookie = 5 stars* one of the only reasons I crave BJ's over other chain restaurants is their infamous Pizookie dessert. I typically order Chocolate Chunk and this never lets me down. Most recently I tried their Cookies 'N Cream Pizookie and it's equally gratifying.3 stars is a fair rating. I don't normally dine here for lunch or dinner  mainly because their food is pretty average w/the exception of the Pizookie. 9 times out of 10 we're here for happy hour or for someone's birthday. The bar area gets very crowded and hard to find a seat if you're with a large party. You'll get the most out of their Happy Hour by ordering the food specials. For drinks  you only get $1 OFF cocktails and beer so if you're looking to get buzzed at a lower cost then TGIF is a better alternative for Happy Hour.
Christine K.,Saratoga Springs  NY,103,288,19,12/5/2011,4.0,Not sure if we just got lucky but we had a great waitress that checked on us multiple times. Food is always consistent and good  had an ahi appetizer  pizza  and gharadelli pizookie.
Rain E.,Milpitas  CA,5,3,1,2/28/2014,5.0,Came here w/ my bf around 2 for a late lunch. Our server Allie (sp?) was very attentive & would check up on us to make sure everything was good. Both our orders treated real good  as well as our white chocolate pizzookie (:
Rosemarie P.,Hayward  CA,569,142,638,3/6/2009,3.0,Every time I go there  the service gets worse and worse. They're lucky the food is so good or I wouldn't ever go back. Damn the service!Love the BBQ Chicken Salad (on romaine lettuce  dressing on the side) - on hit!
Abby O.,Manhattan  NY,11,110,48,1/14/2013,1.0,I've been to this place multiple times (against my will) due to its close proximity to my house. Sadly  each time I become more unimpressed by the food and service. They have a rather large menu which is good if you are dining there with picky eaters. However  the food is the definition of mediocre. Nothing that I have had there is even worth mentioning other than their pizookie. Nothing on the menu is particularly special. Honestly  I could get the same quality of food for cheaper at Chili's  Denny's  etc. For me  service is really important. I'll continue to go back to a place if the people who work there provide excellent service  but this place is lacking in that area as well. I always experience slow  bad service when I'm there. I have to admit that I like the interior of the restaurant and I feel like it has a good atmosphere. So I guess I can kind of see why people go there. Especially if they love beer.
cindy c.,Oakland  CA,259,127,43,1/7/2012,4.0,Yummy appetizers such like the avocado rolls. The dipping sauce that comes with it delicious sweet with a bit of spiciness. Yum!The santa fe rolls are another one of my favorite. The best beginning is what we usually order N it has the above rolls with it  it also comes with mozzarella sticks and spinach and artichoke dip with chip.The drinks are usually on the VERY sweet side  so if you're not Into super sweet cocktails make sure you ask them to reduce the syrup. They have a large variety of beer. And a few selection of wines. They have a pretty large menu and haven't had everything on it  but so far the things I have are very tasty.
Jan P.,San Leandro  CA,1710,462,1259,12/18/2010,4.0,Pizookie gets a five. (white choc macadamia nut). Friends were talking up this dish but thought how good can a cookie dessert in a chain restaurant be? I'm not sure I even wanted to know how right they were. Now the rest of my life is just time in between pizookies.UPDATE- 5 days later. Just realized the origins of the term pizookie is pizza + cookie. Oh!
Cindy C.,Oakland  CA,68,201,450,3/11/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I am so mad at BJ's! This was my favorite location up until i came here one night and the waitress was horrible...so rude! We sat down at 11ish. our waitress came to us late and then started rushing us. She DIDNT bring water til after we order then told us we had to pay the bill before we got our food. We couldnt even eat peacefully without her rushing us telling us we have 15 min then 10 min then 5 like damn! If the host wouldve told us earlier then maybe we wouldnt have stayed ! Or would have sat at the bar! Thanks to this incident  Im officially not coming to this location anymore!
Mandi G.,Fremont  CA,4,5,,3/13/2014,5.0,Love the food here!! It was a long wait but well worth it! Our food came one of the orders was a mistake but the manager came over and handle very well she was professional and apologetic I'm pretty sure her name was Melissa. She was amazing and took care of us. I would have to say Bjs Newark has stepped it up with management and staff.
Diana P.,Fremont  CA,360,159,301,6/13/2011,4.0,This is pretty much the default spot for my friends and I when we want to have a dinner to catch up.. good drinks  good food  not too far of a drive  and not that long of a wait. Been here maybe 4-5 times since it opened & the staff is pretty friendly. One time I had ordered the ahi poke appetizer  and requested extra avocado since there was only like 5 cubes of avocado with my ahi. The waitress was sweet to get it for me not charge since she saw there wasn't that much on plate. She was very attentive to our party and we never had to flag her down when we needed anything. Love love love the berry burst cider  can't get enough of that!
L T.,Hayward  CA,0,26,2,2/21/2011,2.0,"This place reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory minus one important thing - Customer Service. Don\'t get me wrong  I am a fan of BJ\'s in San Diego and Reno  but had not given this Brewhouse a try until the other night. Walked in and was almost awed  it was definitely a hot spot with large screen TVs  a noisy bar and plenty of people waiting to be seated. Curiously  there were open tables when I browsed the floor  and now I know why.Reservations? Sure  10 people or more and 80% of your party must be present before being seated. I get that. But no reservation and you are still required to have 80% of your party there before seating. Wait a minute? If you have kids  this is a real stressor. Especially if you know that people will be trickling in after work and not necessarily show up all at once. Shame on me? If only I had known.While waiting we look over the extensive menu  a definite plus as far as selection goes. Even gluten free options for the growing number of people with allergies. Had to try the gluten free beer and was not disappointed. Not hoppy so if you are an IPA fan  this is not your beer  but for those that like the smoother sweeter beers  this one is tasty enough to get you through the night.Spent enough time reading the multi-page menu and still not at the 80% mark. Fine  kids are restless  but don\'t hassle us about not having everyone there. It\'s your policy and when you say  ""Hey  let\'s all meet up at BJ\'s!"" it\'s not like you will get everyone there at the same time. Making the story short  the manager stepped in and seated us with only 70% present.Food is tasty enough and the selection of brew is impressive; Arrogant Bastard Ale anyone? Kids are now happier with fries  mac-n-chess [which is bigger than the gourmet adult version]  chicken fingers and burgers; the adults are now happier with some drinks in their systems. One thing to ponder: Potatoes bigger than a four year old\'s head! Not natural.But unfortunately  we had to ask for our server for things more than a few times. For the price and the included gratuity  we expected a bit more  but someone mentioned that is just the sign of the times. Seriously? Since when did good customer service change its definition based on generational values?The food was good  beer is better than most  atmosphere is lively  pricing is on the higher side . . . but sadly the deal breaker is the customer service and the way they treated us from the beginning. Not sure we will be going back any time soon. Even if by the end of the night everyone did show up - 100% thank you!"
Raven B.,Union City  CA,22,144,42,2/12/2013,1.0,I went here when it first opened and I wasn't really impressed  but my visit on 2/11/12 sealed the deal for me. My waiter was Jon-Paul and he was very slow helping my group although barely anybody was in the restaurant. It was 10PM and the place wasn't even 1/4 filled. When he was serving us  he kept putting his arm (and later his ARMPIT) in my face instead of finding an easier way to hand us our food/drinks. I found that really disrespectful because a few times he even brushed my bangs and not once did he apologize. Also  I had a question about the check and later when we left  we heard him talking bad about our group to the security guy. The food was OK  but the service makes it not worth coming back.
Razel M.,Seattle  WA,149,256,44,11/11/2011,4.0,"This is me and my girl Grace\'s spot -- whenever I\'m in the bay  odds are we meet here. She always orders the classic burger (""but no dressing  and can I have ranch instead?"") and I\'m the more adventurous one. BJ\'s has a huge menu and  guaranteed  something will look good to you on any given day.We usually sit at the bar and  perhaps people are entertained by our girl talk  but we always end up with free drinks. ;-)Finally  PIZOOKIES.What\'s not to like? =) Well  okay  the service can be hit or miss  although at this branch it\'s usually a hit. And the wait can be pretty bad around dinner time or on the weekends.But  PIZOOKIES."
Paul S.,Fremont  CA,4,2,,4/7/2014,4.0,BJ's gets many bad reviews for their service  that has not been the case for me and my family. Granted if you get there for dinner most nights expect an hour wait..at least! Many times though they will serve free pizza to you in the lobby. Thinks thata a great idea. Last week went to a going away luch with co-workers. Our server Gabby was great. Very cordial and friendly without being phony. Most of the food is average  pizza is good..a little pricey. Anyway for a fun night out I can think of worse places.
Mar A.,San Mateo  CA,246,247,293,2/3/2011,5.0,This place is always crowded--- which means people are coming for a reason  right?I've been here a few times and have never had bad service. The servers are always helpful and friendly  and the bar staff makes very strong drinks.I love their beer here! Their micro brews are delicious (I can't leave unless I have a Jeremiah Red and a Harvest Hef). But this place also has a ton of other non-BJs beers on tap and a lot of others in bottles. They have a full bar  enough TVs and sports to keep everyone satisfied  and waiting space for when it gets super crowded and you have to wait for a table. Bathrooms are always clean  which is a plus for a place that is always crowded.Order the pot roast sandwich. You'll thank me later. And they have a pizza for everyone! I tried the mac n cheese last night and it was the perfect serving size for a small bite. Get it. It's delicious!
Ilana D.,San Leandro  CA,0,15,,7/22/2013,1.0,Got take out 43 dollars for 2 pizzas and drove all the way from Hayward to get it. The pizza wasn't cooked all the way through raw and cold in the middle. All the toppings fell off when you tried to pick ul a slice from the cooked part. Barely any cheese to hold it on. Sad pizza very overpriced.
Samantha S.,San Leandro  CA,60,110,12,5/16/2011,2.0,I've come here a couple of times very recently and I can say the second trip did not redeem the first trip. This rating is all based on the food  not the service.The first time I came here with a small group of friends for drinks. We ended up ordering the best beginning appetizer sampler. The four dishes that made up this sampler all sounded delicious. It came with avocado egg rolls  sante fe spring rolls  spinach dip  mozzarella sticks  and a small selection of dipping sauces. I've had better avocado egg rolls at other BJ's locations  so it's safe to say I was very disappointed. And as far as the sante fe spring rolls go  I'm speechless. They looked like they were old and had been sitting out some where for far to long. The mozzarella sticks and spinach dip were nothing special either. The drink I got was the jerry burst  which I enjoyed. It was a berry cider mixed with some type of beer.The second time I went with a larger group of people. It was very difficult to decide what to get to eat so I ended up getting the mozzarella tomato salad while i made my final decision. The tomatoes had absolutely NO flavor and the balsamic dressing that came with it was completely hard on the plate. It looked very pretty  but the overall taste was pretty disgusting. Even if the balsamic dressing wasn't cemented into the plate it still had an off flavor. I ended up getting the ahi tuna appetizer for dinner because it looked and sounded amazing. To bad it wasn't. I think they might have forgotten to add the sauce that came with it because it was straight flavorless chunks of tuna.I normally love coming to BJ's  but I think I may have to take a brief break before returning soon. The service though both times was amazing!
IC C.,San Lorenzo  CA,3,15,24,2/2/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,If you're coming here in a budget get the macaroni and cheese. Delicious. With ketchup.
Katherine M.,Milpitas  CA,29,18,2,3/24/2013,4.0,Went here with a group of friends. This was my first time at BJs and I am definitely a fan. There are all kinds of TVs throughout the restaurant and it was very busy. If you are looking for a quiet little restaurant  this is not the place for you  but if you are looking for a lively restaurant  here you go. We ordered our lunch and it was served quickly. The portions were a good size. We decided to split dessert and had Pazzokis. These were to die for. Next time  I won't finish my lunch and save more room. The Peanut Butter cookie with chocolate ice was my favorite. I will definitely be back.
Andrew M.,Los Angeles  CA,71,109,34,5/21/2011,2.0,Came here with a bunch of friends to wish me a fun going away. I've been to BJ's before in Foster City and I remembered it being pretty good. This one  well unfortunately I can't say the same. Being a bunch of 21 year olds  we wanted some alcohol and the girl who was serving us  who was very sweet  didn't know anything about the drinks. She wasn't 21 and they didn't teach her what to look for but its okay  still got what we wanted. Their beer is pretty good  a little too skunky for me but I'm always down to try something new. The food was mediocre. I order the Pot Roast sandwich. It was messy  the pot roast was over cooked and the mash potatoes were very mushy. Their pizza was probably the best thing and that was just okay as well. Sorry BJ's  won't be back.
Kim V.,Fremont  CA,178,261,33,1/2/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,UPDATE.Came here a few days ago on a lunch date with 5 other friends. What happened to the cute waiter who serviced my birthday dinner here?!Our waiter was cool. He constantly came back to check on us. My friends walked in and said the placed smelled like WOOD POLISH  lol. I couldn't smell it. But apparently everyone else could.Took us about 15 minute to order  and by the time we were ready  our waiters shift was over  and he came to our table to let us know  and showed us our new waitress.We ordered our food  and she didn't even bring them out. A Manager ended up bringing us our food. She took forever to bring us our check. We spent more time waiting for our check and to process our cards  then we spent eating our food. And when we asked her to bring to-go boxes  she attempted to pack them for us (I'm picky with my food)  so I reached for one of the boxes on the table to pack my own leftovers  and she reached over and snatched it back out of my hand and said she got it  and I said no  it's okay  i'll pack my own. Talk about rude service.1 star for the manager and his AWESOME friendliness  and 1 star for the delish Cheddar Broccoli Sourdough Bowl Soup.
Cynthia L.,Union City  CA,46,63,36,5/31/2011,1.0,I enjoy the food here but the wait is always so long. It doesn't matter when you go (time of day  day of the week). They are always crowded. I went with my 1 year old daughter and my cousin. They sat us in the back room. The table that was available was not the best table. It was so close to the surrounding tables. People kept bumping into my daughter's high chair. One waiter bumped her 3 times. Customers bumped her twice. I moved her  but the place was so crowded and people were running around all over the place that it didn't matter where her high chair was placed. The safest place for my daughter was in my arms or on top of our table. I like the food  but don't like the environment or the fact that people (staff and patrons alike) do not pay any mind to little ones. I'd say it's not kid friendly. Our waitress forgot my daughter's juice  I had to ask her three times for her juice. As far as food goes  the Avocado Wrap was really good and filling. The Santa Fe salad was good.
Tiffany M.,Sacramento  CA,303,461,513,2/11/2009,4.0,Despite the wait.Anything on their menu will not disappoint you. Beers and pizza  a must get when you do come.ALSO  you must get a PIZOOKIE!!! A fresh baked  hot out of the oven  RICH cookie topped with scoops of vanilla ice cream and served in its own deep dish. **I favor the white chocolate macadamia nut.**
Jessica H.,San Ramon  CA,54,233,273,12/19/2010,4.0,"I really like this place. The food is good  love the chicken wings. I got the deep dish pizza  it was probably one of the best pizzas! I really love the Pizookie as well  got the double chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream. I have to say  pretty good combo  but I would try something else next time. Okay...this place got a 4 star since the service was ""too good"". The guy kept on bothering us  I felt he was like listening to my conversation with my friend too! I think the waiter is a bit bothersome."
David A.,East Bay  CA,8,52,8,3/18/2014,5.0,BJ's is the most best restaurant to go to. They have amazing foods and a Pzookie man that's awesome and delicious. The pizza is good and very reasonable price. The burgers omg don't get me started about the burgers they hit the spot real good. Anybody want to come there try the Pzookie it's soo delicious. I want to come and eat there on my birthday.
Jeff Y.,Fremont  CA,67,52,,1/21/2012,4.0,This is way overdue I went twice and still haven't wrote a review till now! Going inside in Bj's Restaurant  holy crap it get really full at night  and you really have to go there a little early if not you're either outside freezing your butt off  or stand all night till you're call up (if longer than 30 minute forget about it) unless you're with your family of course.For appetizer I ordered flatbread pizza...both are california club  and grilled chicken pesto. Love the pizza!Main course 1st visit: BBQ Pull Porked Sandwich - very tasty2nd visit: surprise it another pizza i'm like great  anyway I order the barbeque chicken pizza and the BJ Bacon Cheeseburger(my personal favorite for BJ and MOST RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!)No Dessert because I be full eating deep dish pizza FAIL!Food overall is good  but the price doesn't go down which suck  so you might have to bring a little bit of cash with you in case  I'll come back again if it with a family  or with group of friend!
Dawn L.,Fremont  CA,0,1,,4/14/2015,1.0,Ordered online lightly battered artichoke heart appetizers. They were heavily battered and almost burnt. Ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce on the side & added side wedge salad with 1000 island dressing on side. The marinara sauce was not put on the side as requested and the spaghetti was cold. I did not like the sauce so the whole entree was thrown out. Instead of 1000 island dressing I received blue cheese which I dislike. Was anyone paying attention ? I have been sick and was looking forward to a good meal but this was a complete waste of money. After paying the service fees etc. I have learned a very expensive lesson. Will not order at BJs again.
Alyssa R.,Visalia  CA,25,60,33,12/24/2013,3.0,Went for my office dinner and I've done a special event at bjs before and they didn't want to give us the special even menu because we didn't have a contract. That was a big inconvenience. I never needed a contract before  after talking to the manager we finally were Able to order. The waitresses are all rude and give attitude  the only nice people are the managers. We had one waitress come with a platter we didn't order and she got irritated because it wasn't ours and our actual waitress for the night started fighting with her because she was at HER table. They may need to hire more mature staff  it was somewhat a good night  but that was just because who I was with.
Tran N.,Kentfield  CA,156,281,17,10/9/2011,3.0,The beer here is good  but I wish the food is more consistent. I always order the balsamic glazed chicken  but once in a while the chicken is over cooked and really dry. I don't think the wait is too bad here  the estimate that the hostess gives is actually pretty good. Once in a while a server will give out some free pizza to people who are waiting.
Rachel A.,Fremont  CA,4,14,,3/31/2015,1.0,We ordered to go from BJ's and won't be going back anytime. Tortilla soup was salty to the point that it was inedible; clam chowder had a fishy taste to it  also inedible; the two sandwiches we ordered were barely mehh; the fries were the skimpiest side I've ever seen. All that for $35. Never again. Not sure what happened  this place used to be pretty decent.
Eddie M.,Union City  CA,2,210,55,4/4/2013,1.0,it was so crowded and the menu is not for us. Husband didn't like the beer  and he is a brewer so we wont be back. Tables really close and crowded and noisy and good for young people I guess
Katie N.,San Francisco  CA,932,223,1202,10/7/2012,1.0,"When I lived in San Jose  I loved going to BJs at Oakridge  I think I went there so much I had a personal bartender. With that said  I thought I\'d give this one a try. The BF and I came here on a Friday  since I called ahead  we were seated right away and that\'s where it became a 1 star. Since I\'m familiar with the menu  I just wanted to get some drinks started but nope  we sat there for 10 minutes  without a single acknowledgment. We saw servers passing by and no one even stopped to say ""Hi"" or ""I\'ll be right with you "" NADA. There was a party of 4 that got service as soon as they sat down and we were sitting there for 15 minutes now! It was like we were invisible! I could have said something  or ask for a manager  but instead I lost my patience and I just decided to leave  don\'t think I will return to this BJs since it left a bad impression in my book."
Tiffany C.,Fremont  CA,80,4,,1/29/2012,4.0,"I think by now I should be considered a regular here! Ever since I came back from college to the East Bay  I have gone to BJ\'s a ton just because there are very few places that are open late night on the weekends. Venue is pretty big compared to the other BJ\'s I\'ve been to. Place seems like a full house Thurs-Sat nights. If you come around 10/11PM there may be a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2-4 people.Some people may consider the food to be a bit on the expensive side but I think the prices are pretty fair for the portions you get. The food is average in my opinion and I usually order the California Chicken Sandwich with Crispy Thin Fries. BJ\'s also has a small bites menu. Small bites meaning good for 1.5 persons. There is a wide selection of beers but since I\'m a beer hater...I can\'t elaborate on that part of the drink menu. Drinks are average prices (~$8-9) and are usually above average in strength. I usually get the enlightened drinks to try and make me feel better about consuming my high calorie sandwich/fries. The ""Skinny Rita"" is okay and is supposed to be the strongest of the enlightened drinks.( I suggest mixing it with a straw before drinking it.) I tried the ""Mojito Lite"" once and I hated it...I suggest sticking with the regular mojitos. Since I come here so much  I kind of wish they had happy hour. (Unless I\'m totally clueless...which is entirely possible...so they may have happy hour??)Considering the food and drinks the place is average. I gave an extra star just because it has been my go to place for late night the past few weeks."
Shannon L.,East Bay  CA,1348,2568,3287,11/14/2008,2.0,"Originally we made a reservation for 12  but only 6 of our party showed up. So I\'m surprised we still got such good treatment. 2 stars for that! And even with only 6 people  we still had 2 servers! I hate how inconsistent chains can be with their food. Maybe it\'s because my standards for eating were much lower in college  but I remember the BJ\'s in Tustin being so wonderful to go to! I always loved eating the avocado egg rolls  deep dish pizzas  and pizookies. Today I split a medium size BBQ Chicken pizza with my friend and it was $20! Outrageous. There are 6 hefty-sized slices but the pizza came out lukewarm and kind of bland. It ALMOST tasted microwaved....oh BJ\'s please tell me you do not microwave!! That will put you on the same playing field as TGIF/Chevy\'s/Olive Garden. I also tried the Oreo Pizookie with French Vanilla ice cream. What makes this ""Oreo"" is that the whip cream is cookies \'n cream flavored. The chocolate cookie was undercooked so it was also lukewarm and gooey  in a bad way. I personally feel that Vanilla BEAN ice cream would\'ve gone better... the French Vanilla threw it off a little.This place is your typical BJ\'s--big restaurant  sports bar with big screens  lots of traffic. Service was surprisingly good and the food came out fast. I would definitely recommend this for big groups but to be honest  if you\'re a chain restaurant and not good at the opening  I don\'t know how good you\'ll be from then on!"
Kim H.,Newark  CA,8,67,3,12/10/2013,4.0,I've said it before  Newark isn't exactly a hotbed of excitement  but there are a couple of spots to have a sip and nosh in the area. BJ's in Newark is a fantastic location on game day. I went with a friend last Sunday to cheer on the 9ers and was blown away by the great grub and service. Our server  Loriann was busting a move with the crowd but managed to keep the food and drinks coming and with one cool attitude and wonderful recommendations. As a gluten-free diner  this place is one of the best  especially for casual dining...I had pizza and a pazookie! Heavenly! Great game day happy hour specials  great service  and really decent gluten-free food. I'm a fan!
Maya M.,Fremont  CA,50,21,6,12/8/2014,1.0,"Made reservations and Came here with a group of about 8 for my friend\'s birthday dinner. WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN A RESTAURANT. A friend of mine wasn\'t very hungry so she got two appetizers  her calamari came out completely cold so they sent it back. They also got avocado egg rolls so while they were waiting for their calamari they were about to take a bite and a nice big hair was sticking out of it. Those got sent back as well. On top of that when the calamari came out we realized they re-fried the SAME calamari. So it was literally like hard rubber. We just said forget it and we don\'t even want it anymore just take it off the tab. On top of all THAT  we had all had our entrees out and my boyfriend was still waiting for his. At first it wasn\'t a big deal but after we asked over 3 times they brought the manager Rich or Rick out whatever his name was and he showed the slightest sincerity or care at all. He was not at all apologetic or seemed to care. So they\'re probably just used to giving terrible service. He just kept telling us ""it\'ll be right out"" ""it should be out soon"" (it was just a small lunch entree by the way  just a piece of fried chicken on some mashed potatoes) you would think it was the most extravagant thing on the menu. By this time almost all of us were getting out plates taken away because we were all finished and then they finally brought out his damn dinner. We came to have a Birthday dinner together with our friend and he didn\'t even get to eat at the same time as us. And on top of THAT we told the waiter it was our friend\'s birthday and he started taking care of our checks already. When we got our checks we told him again and he brought out a mini pizzookie for him. The only thing that justifies them even getting one star was that the food tasted decent."
Johnny G.,Hong Kong,236,102,333,6/14/2011,2.0,I have been to BJ's multiple times  but I always can't really find anything to order. Everything looks and sounds mediocre. And sure enough  everything also tastes mediocre.I have tried  Fish and Chips  pork roast sandwich  a variety of pizzas and pastas  but nothing really stands out. I do like the environment and it's a good place to have a drink with friends.Here is my biggest complaint. They do not accept reservation for party of 10 and under. What the heck. I am trying to give them business and they don't want it.Tips:- I really don't know what is good here  maybe you can give me some tips or suggestions by writing a reply or sending me a message. Haha.Overall:- Nothing special  probably will come back if friends are hanging out there.
Curtis C.,San Jose  CA,166,27,22,9/14/2010,4.0,With Mervyn's having shuttered their doors long ago  BJ's sits alone across from the Newpark Mall  a dessert oasis (more on that to come) in a literally deserted strip mall. Location aside  the parking lot is always full and the restaurant bustling  leaving BJ's Brewhouse and my post happy hour waistline as two things that are definitely not suffering from recession. Speaking of dollars and scents  the smell of deep dish pizza and sinfully delicious pizookie wafting through the air as you step through the door will get your taste buds firing on all cylinders without doing too much damage to your pocketbook. The key to a successful BJ's run is to go during happy hour  or to catch their weekday lunchtime specials  that way you have free reign on all their best menu items at cut-rate prices. Some of my favs on the menu include the sliders (pulled pork or angus beef  both are delicious) with fries  most of the pizzas  spinach artichoke dip w/ tortilla chips  and the egg rolls. Of course no visit to BJ's is complete without ordering a pizookie. A word of warning to anyone who finds themselves sharing one of these bad boys with me  try to take any of the crispy cookie edge and I will parry carte the hell out of your spoon. I didn't take 4 weeks of fencing class at the Brea Community Center for nothing. Well actually I took it because it seemed random  and I'm random  but that's neither here nor there.Aside from the food  BJ's also serves their own line of decent brews. I've been known to imbibe my fair share of the Jeremiah Red and Piranha Pale Ale during many a happy hour. The combination of tasty bar food  good beer  and a gigantic wall of TVs playing every sporting event imaginable  makes BJ's a pretty righteous spot to catch a ball game.Hits: Happy hour specials  lunch specials  ginormous TV wallMisses: Crowds  somewhat limited bar seating at this locationWords of wisdom: Arrive early if you want to snag a table in the bar  lunch specials are weekdays only  check out the late night happy hour if you missed the early one
Ashish A.,Fremont  CA,3,2,,2/18/2014,3.0,The ambience is nice  so is the location. But the service sucks. Their waiter/waitress are either too burdened or overloaded with work.
Mary T.,Hayward  CA,95,248,205,6/7/2011,4.0,I like this BJ's location the best. They are on point with their stuff and the food is great. The chicken wings are the right size  not skimped on like the BJ's in Foster City.  Get their chicken wings with sauce on the side and their wedge cut fries as an appetizer to share. Delish! Hubby likes this location cause they have all beers on tap from all over the place. Guys  what can you say? So  if you are looking for a certain beer  you may be able to find it here.
Bre E.,Fremont  CA,6,36,9,11/26/2013,5.0,Randomly decided to head out to Bjs tonight. Had a huge craving for their stuffed mushrooms. We were greeted warmly  & seated promptly. Our server  Jesse  was assisting our table quickly  & we had waters at our table before we even knew it. He was awesome. Very prompt & courteous. If you go ask for his section! He's really great.
Jamie H.,Hayward  CA,0,24,1,1/17/2014,4.0,Hubby and I came here for the first time in December..they were packed but seated us within 15 mins. Being that busy I expected to wait  but was pleasantly surprised when we didn't. They brought drinks right away  appetizers and the main dish in a very timely fashion and we had eaten and were gone in 50 minutes which was great since we had to go pick up our kids from the babysitter. The food was great  hot and yummy and my hubby likes the root beer. It was clean  including the bathroom and the decor is nice... and I have to say  it's obviously popular  it was hopping. Was very impressed all the way around. Two thumbs up from us  taking the kids next!
Donna L.,Hayward  CA,370,65,139,8/16/2010,5.0,I'm a regular here so this review is long overdue! BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is one of the best restaurants I ever ate at!This restaurant is usually packed but you can call ahead to be put on the wait list. And if you drop in on a busy day/night  general wait time averages from 30-40 min wait or longer. On several occasions  I had to wait 30-40 minutes for a table but it was so worth it!Some of the dishes I had tried and would recommend is the Cajun Pasta  Chicken Alfredo  Baked Potato  Pizza  Turkey Club Sandwich and the desserts of course! So tasty and delicious! The portions for these meals are much larger. As for the price for the meals  you can get tasty meals between $8 - $15  very affordable considering the large portions!Customer service may be a bit slow because this restaurant is so popular and packed but the server is generally kind and try to do their best to accommodate you!If you haven't tried the food here  you're missing out! BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is perfect for both small and large groups  the food is delicious and comes in large portions and is extremely affordable!* * * * * FIVE STARS * * * * *
Lorrie M.,San Jose  CA,3289,2978,262,2/1/2009,4.0,I always have a great experience at BJ's so I really can't say too many bad things about this place except that it seems to be the common theme at all BJ's when they get busy  the service just DROPS.This is sad because honestly they get busy a lot and it would be nice if they had apt waiters that knew what to do. Other than that I have to say the food here for a chain restaurant is FANTASTIC. I always get their delicious chili cheese fries or sliders  and their jambalaya is one of a kind. Finally  as I'm sure everyone knows ... PIZOOKIE ... white chocolate macadamian nut HEAVEN ... *do not disturb... I am eatingz*
Sammy C.,East San Jose  San Jose  CA,0,10,1,2/10/2014,5.0,Food is really good.excllent customer service .this is only my favorite place where I goes every week .
Christine C.,San Francisco  CA,559,268,75,9/3/2010,4.0,one of the few places like this in Fremont  i like that they have late night happy hour especially since there isn't much to do after 10pm.been here twice before and went last night for a friend's bday. they give you a mini pizooki on your bday!the happy hour isn't completely amazing unless you get their pizza - half off! their strawberry splash is yummy since you can barely taste the alcohol & they do have my favorite belgium beer lindemans framboise. good place to be loud and socialize.i'd still choose yardhouse over BJs tho.
jack l.,San Mateo  CA,24,73,77,3/1/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,The mark of a great restaurant is not just putting food out fast  but puting out top quality food and making your customers happy in the process. This is precisely what the staff here has done for me and my family. Don't get me wrong here. The place is not perfect because the kitchen had issues but they more than made up with it great food and service.   We came to Bj's on a busy Friday night and got seated within 20 minutes. We were greeted by our server Ravinder (forgive the spelling if it is wrong) who was cordial and friendly. She took our order and brought our drinks with a smile. We happily went about drinking our drinks and talking away. About the time we noticed that our food was not coming our server and kitchen manager Phillip arived and told us that they had run out of sauce and had to re-fire our food. To make up for the error they comped us appetizers and coffee while we waited for our new dishes to be prepared. We were more than happy to accept and in no time our dishes arived and we were both happy and well fed. Evidence of the care taken to prepare the food was evident in the food that was delivered. Attention to detali was taken in the plating and the shrimp scampi was cooked perfectly. This place has cemented a place as one of my all time favorite hangouts. They handled an awkward situation with geace and a passion for quality so I give this place my best review.
Richard G.,Los Altos Hills  CA,168,447,464,6/27/2009,4.0,One of my clients suggested a late dinner and wanted to try out the new BJ's in Newark. Maybe because it was a Tuesday  we did not encounter any of the wait times that my fellow yelpers encountered. I think they may be a victim of their popularity in the local area.The place was very full for a Tuesday night. We were seated right a way and our drinks arrived promptly with our salad and soup. I found my salad to be very fresh and crispy and just the right amount of dressing. Our server announced that she was taking a short break and announced who would be covering for her. I was very impressed as I do not recall anyone doing this before. Her replacement server made sure we got our entrees of roasted chicken and I ordered the Salmon which was cooked to perfection and served with wonderful vegetables and rice  a good selection. They really did a wonderful job of keeping our glasses full and we were too stuffed to order any dessert. So there you have it  great service  upscale ambiance  and fantastic food. Too bad I was driving as I would like to have sampled their home made brews. The home brewed Root Beer was a wonderful addition to my meal and my client really enjoyed the Strawberry Lemonade.They have many High Definition TVs to keep up on the Sports scene.
C.C. S.,Union City  CA,1,24,7,8/5/2014,3.0,Ok so my family and I were looking forward to a nice sunday dinner together. We decide to come to this restaurant. We've eaten here before when it first opened and had a great experience. Not so much this time. Perhaps it was a bad night but there is no excuse to just ignore your customers. Like i said it was a sunday night around 8pm and the place was packed  no big deal. We wait our turn and were seated in a decent amount of time. 10-15 minutes later and still no one comes to even ask if we want water. Waitress looks our way but never even says hi or one moment. Nothing! We wait longer and then we notice people who arrived after us are getting their orders taken. Wth? Ok we decide to leave and the gals at the desk say thanks for coming. Uh you obviously forgot you just sat us down. Anyhoo back in the car and on the hunt for food at 9pm. I could have just stayed home and cooked. Again maybe just a bad night but i am not in a hurry to return here. Im being generous with 3 stars. Ijs.
Chris C.,San Ramon  CA,231,294,9,1/19/2009,4.0,I had a group of 25 here a few days ago. Any group larger than 19 has to be a 'banquet'  which I setup a month in advance.The banquet menu has different combinations of things  usually the entree is all you can eat with complimentary soda. I went for the four pizza and added individual pizookies. You get 2 hours for your session  so if you start at 6pm  you would end at 8pm.I had Great White  BJ's favorite  Sweet Pig and another one which I forget as well as the class pizookie.Overall things were fine  the staff was friendly  and we got through round and a half of pizza. They didn't really give me a full-second round of pizzas though  I only remember 2 or 3 of the four getting replaced (maybe they weren't totally empty when they did the swap). Not a big deal  but I went for seconds only to find that there wasn't another Great White. I could have said something  but none of my guests were complaining so I let it slide.Overall  it was a great dinner for my friends  but it would have been difficult had I not set it up in advance.
Jill S.,Indian Trail  NC,3,13,1,6/5/2012,3.0,Really liked this restaurant. We waited for 20 minutes for a table... and the magical thing about it... They said 20 minutes... and it was actually only 20 minutes... It was refreshing... The only thing I could say negativly about my experiance is that the menu was a bit intimidating... there was so much on it. I ordered the Calzone and my associate ordered the Spaghetti. Both were great. Desert was to die for... I cant remember what it was called... But it was a cookie with icecream... Pazzok? maybe?Anyway... I would go here again... and just might tonight.
Steve B.,Fremont  CA,68,34,7,1/4/2014,5.0,I always have a good experience when i come over to this BJ's. I love their pizza and their big screen tv's. Did i mention the beer? No? Prettt awesome!! The only thing is that sometimes their tv's have no volume so hard to totally get into the games.
Farzana V.,Fremont  CA,0,6,,10/4/2012,1.0,This place does not even deserve the 1 star yelp makes me put!!!!! I was burnt 3 times by this restaurant (i should have stopped at the first time).NEVER order take out and if you do make sure you open ALL your food items and check. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with extra mashed potato (which they charged btw) and surprise! no potato AT ALL. Ordered extra sauce another time and wouldn't you know it.... no sauce at all.... The third time I actually checked to make sure they had sauce but did not open the container and got TARTAR sauce with chicken ....Thank for charging extra for nothing BJs. I have been to 3 other branches in Foster City  San Jose and Cupertino and all of them have been consistent with great service but this one just does not seem to care. That was the last order I ever give them.
J C.,Richmond  CA,0,12,,10/18/2012,1.0,"I came here for my cousin\'s birthday at the beginning of October. Note that I only stayed because it was his birthday and I wasn\'t going to ruin it because of someone\'s terrible ethics or lack of manners.When I walked in to reserve a table  the server barely acknowledged me. No thank you  no welcome to BJ\'s. Nothing. I let that go. If she was having a bad day and couldn\'t suck it up  whatever. Later on while we were outside waiting  my cousin (being the optimistic  silly guy that he is) says something along the lines of ""oh she must think I\'m cute"" jokingly. I look over and it\'s that same girl with the attitude working the take out counter staring at us. A few minutes later one of her coworkers comes over and she says something to him and they both stare  no smile. It honestly felt like a high school exchange. I called after my 24 hour shift two days after the incident. Asked to speak to a manager regarding what happened  because it was definitely uncalled for. No one called back. Thanks for that BJ\'s management. Really professional.The kicker? I would\'ve just let this go because it\'s not worth it  but I find it really odd that I woke up with an upset stomach and experienced the symptoms of food poisoning during my 24 hour shift.I think it\'s pretty ridiculous for anyone to have this behavior  especially when the customer has done NOTHING wrong and nothing to you. There are plenty of other people who can suck up whatever they\'re going through and work and actually be thankful for a job and show it. I\'ve been spit at/on  assaulted  had every obscenity yelled at me  whatever you can think of on the job  and you know what? I still suck it up and do my job because that\'s what I was hired to do. Not act like an immature brat for no reason at all. I know I\'m just one customer and I wont affect your business  but I\'ll never be back to this location.My apologies for the lengthy review  but I had to let it out somewhere."
Aishwarya G.,Fremont  CA,87,114,141,7/29/2013,4.0,Best beginnings is good  liked the santa fe chicken
Mitty C.,Fremont  CA,1093,390,184,6/23/2011,4.0,Pizookies are amazing! The happy hour appetizers are decently priced as well  though the alcohol prices really aren't marked down much but given the Newark/Fremont area  there aren't that many options for late night drinking anyway so I'm going to let that slide. The food is usually pretty decent  although I have been there on some occasions when the food could have used more attention by the chef. There seems to be an inconsistent dinner rush that isn't wholly dependent on the day of the week at all. Just keep in mind if you're going with a large party  to arrive earlier if possible cause you'll probably be waiting. $4 mini pizzas during happy hours are delicious.
Carina R.,Newark  CA,0,535,,5/24/2013,3.0,BJ's is me and the hubster's go-to place when we can't think of anywhere interesting to go to eat. It's usually pretty lively  there's beer  and decent food. That's really all we want in a place to chill at on a Friday after a long week at work. The wait is usually at least 30 minutes (sometimes an hour)  but it's not that bad because we usually go to the bar and have a few beers before we get seated. Sometimes we'll get lucky and we're able to sit at the bar or at the bar tables for a while before  too. Sometimes not - the bar can be really crowded. The beers BJ's has on tap are pretty good. And if you don't like their beers they always have outside beers on tap and beers in the bottle. Their mixed drinks are pretty good  too. There's something for everyone when it comes to drinks. Their food is hit or miss. The apps are pretty good. Salads are too. I usually get the pizza and that's always delicious. But some of their entrees are either really good or just so-so. I would stick to the burgers and sandwiches. Everything else  to me  has always been not that good. Every time I get something other than the pizza or a salad - like a baked potato  chicken  fish  etc. I have been let down. I usually regret ordering that and think I should have gotten the pizza like I usually do. Their service is so-so as well. Its hit or miss. You either get someone who is super on it or someone who ignores you for most of the time. BJ's is alright. Not the best  but pretty darn good.
Brenda H.,Fremont  CA,45,543,13,8/26/2010,3.0,I came here with my 5 cousins and brother to have dinner. It was probably the first time we sat down immediately. So that alone made me pretty happy. It was weird. We were actually helped by 3-4 different servers. We had 1 main server  but she was sometimes there....sometimes not. Kinda strange.  Anywhoo  i had the 10in thin crust gluten pizza...all veggies with no cheese. it was pretty tasty. i'd definitely order that again. The three starts is because NOTHING HERE IS HEALTHY. if you are conscious about what you put in your body  go someplace else. Otherwise  have a beer. Invite some friends. And have a nice casual time.
Tiffany K.,Fremont  CA,906,996,49,12/7/2008,3.0,Wow  a BJ's in Fremont  well Newark technically? I feel like im in Cupertino! This particular location is around the same size as the one in South San Jose. Upon entering the restaurant  the first thing I noticed was the rotating glass doors. I thought this was really really odd for a restaurant like BJ's. It doesn't fit with the environment whatsoever  and it just caused unnecessary traffic and issues when the 15 year olds were running in circles and holding the doors so their friends couldn't get through.The service really wasn't that great here... While waiting for a table  my girlfriend and I decided to go to the bar. It took forever to get someone's attention since it was packed - and one of the bartenders just stood there staring off into space  totally not realizing that we were trying to get a drink. One of the bartenders who was actually busy  had to ask her to help us.Our waiter was fine in the beginning  and just totally disregarded us towards the end. After clearly finishing our food  since I left my plate at the end of the table  our waiter just kept walking right past our table not even asking us if we were done or needed boxes or our check or anything. After we finished eating  it took him about 20 minutes to finally come and ask if we needed help.As far as the food  I got a grilled chicken alfredo pasta  and it was okay. my food came out cold.Overall  this BJ's is okay. After trying three BJ's  the Cupertino location is still the best.... however  im gunna have to come back one day just to get a Pizookie. Can't really mess that one up.
Big S.,Concord  CA,163,32,88,3/9/2013,1.0,Recently I visited the restaurant in Newark and wished I had not gone. The food is good and the beer is fantastic. The problem is the service and the management. It was not packed in anyway and you can see they had so many people on the payroll doing anything but servicing the few people that were paying customers. It got so bad the security guard in the parking lot started ushering people to the tables while the hostesses were chatting away. Any special request was meeting with rude looks and I was really wishing I had not been there. It will be the last time I ever set foot in a BJ restaurant again. I don't expect people to do anything but service the customer and I guess that is asking too much.
Greg H.,Fremont  CA,325,167,16,7/10/2011,4.0,This place is always great to eat with friends and or family. I come here often and every time I'm greeted by friendly hostesses and get served by chill waitresses.I firmly believe that every meal should be completed with either their root beer or cream soda. But i mean  that's just my opinion.this place is awesome  hands down
Mike D.,Fremont  CA,0,31,,2/14/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Recent i decided to give this place another chance and I called in advance to reserve a table for a party of 8. We were all there 5 minutes early and they said that they did not have the reservation and they expected us to wait 45 minutes? This really upsets me as the food has always been really good but the service here is terrible. I took the group to Elephant Bar and was seated right away. I am so over this place.
Leslie P.,Torrance  CA,70,1006,1184,7/5/2010,3.0,There's not many restaurant&bars in the area. they are mostly in fremont or in union landing in UC. So this one is pretty popular. The food is a-okay. like i said for another review  pizookies are O.R (=overrated). this is the only BJs that i've had HH at  and it's relatively a good deal. deals on food & drinks.
Kevin B.,Fremont  CA,61,73,33,8/13/2013,4.0,Love bjs....blonde beer is where its at...food is delicious...a little pricey though...but love the staff and bartenders...
David H.,Palo Alto  CA,21,42,7,5/31/2012,4.0,"Start it off with some avocado rolls and end it with the ""mi-SOOOO good"" salmon... you won\'t be disappointed. You can get the pizookie if you dare  but I\'d make sure I had someone to share it with before I ordered it for one.Long waits... about half an hour on average  so it\'s a good idea to send a sacrificial lamb to get signed in."
Andrew N.,Newark  CA,0,2,,1/9/2015,5.0,We were served by Mark at the takeout on friday night. He was pretty awesome and helpful. It also helped that he looked nice! 10/10 service. Would come again.
Eve B.,San Luis Obispo  CA,1,10,,1/6/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I decided to give this place another try after getting in contact with management and I'm very glad I did.And before you wonder why I gave 4 stars to this place while other unique places get less than  I'm basing these reviews on what the places are  not in comparison to other. Apples and oranges obviously. Moving on...The service was much better. Our waiter was much more friendly and attentive even though it was much more busy than before.The food was definitely worth it this time around. I just know now to only order pizza. The only issue is that I ordered a giant pizookie for my friends and myself to share. I think it was so big that it cooked unevenly in places so some parts seemed hard and stuck to the pan and other parts were under cooked. Still tasty though. Overall  3.5 stars but I'll round it up. ^_^
Kimberly L.,San Jose  CA,88,314,341,9/3/2013,2.0,Came here on July 4th. There was a bit of a wait. I thought the quality of their food would be the same as their San Mateo location  but it was not. I go to their San Mateo location often for lunch and they are always on point. This location seems to be lacking on service. Also the food was just alright.
Izel P.,Fremont  CA,159,44,7,9/24/2012,2.0,I used to really love this restaurant but the service lately has been lacking. Last few times I was here  service was extremely slow. One time  we had a waitress who did not seem to know what she was doing. She didn't check up on us  she forgot our waters  it took forever to get our entrees after we have been eating our appetizers for 30-40 mins! We were so hungry we ate most of the appetizer and barely touched our entrees because we were getting full. It also took forever to get our check. Ridiculous! Also  prices on some menu items have gone up so I've been turned off to this place. I only look forward to coming here because of my love for the pizookie.
Brett P.,San Ramon  CA,59,62,17,7/19/2013,4.0,Grabbing dinner and pazookies with friends. The great white is super yum! Pazookie platter is the best!
Kameelah C.,Oakland  CA,2,11,15,10/5/2013,5.0,Today me and my hubby went to this BJ's for the first time. And I can tell you that it will not be the last time. The food was great and we received exceptional service from our server named April! She is the bomb  Everytime we come here we must sit in her section! More restaurants need better employees like April!
Sue E.,Fremont  CA,0,4,,1/24/2015,3.0,food quality variable - sometimes great (like their Brewmaster hamburger) but the following visit barely warm (ditto accompanying fries). At such times  it's obvious that they're understaffed with prepared food just waiting to be picked up and served. much depends  of course  on the chefs as well - and  again  a great difference as to what you get in quality and quantity (like toppings on a pizza)..but for this area  it's one of the better places to go so my friends and I are regulars.
Laura H.,Livermore  CA,0,17,1,1/15/2012,4.0,I go to BJ's at least once a week. The staff is friendly and efficient; the place is well managed; and the food is quite a good value - you get a good amount of food of good quality at a decent price. The only drawback to BJ's is how noisy it is - but that's to be expected in a sports bar.My favorite dishes are the Jambalaya  the gourmet mac & cheese (deliciously spiced up with chipotle)  the wedge salad  and  of course  the pizzas. And they also have some excellent desserts - the pazookies are delicious and so are the beignets. So save room!
Rochelle B.,Fremont  CA,16,10,18,9/23/2011,1.0,"Food good. Beer good. Pizookie good. Service........ SUCKS! So bad  I think I am done with BJ\'s. If I really have a craving  I will be driving to San Mateo because at least you get treated with respect at that one. The Fremont BJ\'s is horrible. It all starts with the hostesses. There is too many of them up there  and they always seem to forget about people. It has happened on 3 occasions to me or someone I know that the hostesses started seating other people who came in after us  first. Then being rude about it until they realize they forgot you. And they always say ""oh  we called you"". Uh  no you didn\'t idiot. We were sitting right in front of you seeing how long until you notice us sitting here. P.S. Don\'t order mixed drinks. They will tell you the order a double if you realize there is not a full shot of liquor in the drink."
Lisa T.,Hayward  CA,0,3,,7/20/2014,1.0,Waited over an hour to get 1 of the 2 salads that we ordered. The server saw that I didn't have a meal and didn't say anything  I assumed they were going to bring it out right after. About 10 minutes later  she finally comes to ask how we're doing and I asked about my salad. I'm sure she forgot to put the order in. Instead of apologizing  she just said  it's coming right now . Terrible service. We also asked for a coffee that she didn't bring for an hour and when she finally did  she didn't bring sugar until asking for it twice. When I finally told her forget about bringing my salad and the sugar for the coffee and just take it off of our bill  she said to wait to ask her manager. Another wait  then the manager told her that they'd take the salad off the bill and give to us for take out which wet declined. The manager did not come to talk to us until we finally had to ask. We didn't even order dessert  which is the main reason we wanted to go there. We will not be.visiting this location again  terrible service.
Tracy L.,Carol Stream  IL,568,107,86,5/24/2011,4.0,I come here every time i come to california for two reasons: 1) POTATO SKINS ARE DELICIOUS!!!!! 2) pizooki's are freaking amazingmeal-wise they have a lot to choose from  even a calorie count menu if you really want to know what's going in your body. fish tacos were ok  ribs and chicken is great  the personal pizzas are good because they have a soft crust  the burgers are really good too i had the grilled burger melt (that's the same idea AND better than the frisco melt from steak n shake! haha!) but let me get to the good stuff:potato skin appetizer: GET THEM. they're not scraped so thin like some potato skins  they actually have something to bite into  melted cheese  bacon bits  and ranch and sour cream dipping sauce?! hell yeah!pizooki: get your own  get a tasting platter to pick 3 flavors  or get a party platter that's the size of a pizza with like 8 sccops of ice cream piled high on it!! (share that with 5 or more) can't go wrong with any of the flavors  the newest one is RED VELVET...orgasm. i'll admit the ghirardelli choc on choc is really really really chocolatey.  happy hr's awesome! bartender let me taste beers all i wanted before i bought one! they brew some beers just try them  but they also have a nice selection for girly drinks too. ALWAYS a go to spot  has huge TV's and little tvs everywhere  great spot to watch games and hang out
Nancy T.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,608,125,19,5/19/2013,3.0,I've been here twice  once for their pizookie which was really yummy and the second time I went with my boyfriend for dinner. For appetizers I had the stuff spinach mushrooms which were really tasty! Unfortunately when I got to the main course.. I was very disappointed. I ordered the shrimp scampi and it had no flavor. The garlic bread was the only thing with flavor that was on that plate.. It was pretty much a plate full of pasta and bread crumbs with no flavor.. There was a good amount of shrimp in it  the only plus.. My boyfriend got one of the pizza's which wasn't bad but when he asked our waiter for parmesan cheese for his pizza.. the waiter never brought it. Overall my experience was not so good.. may come back to try something else or just for the pizookie. 3 stars for the stuffed mushrooms and the pizookie.
Corinna S.,San Luis Obispo  CA,287,37,7,9/15/2014,3.0,let me start off by saying that pizookies are heaven in cookie form and that you have not lived until you've tried one. pizookies are essentially the only reason i would come to bj's. that's not to say that their food isn't good because it definitely is! it's just not really anything special. also  it's hit or miss when it comes to getting a good server. some are super friendly and patient  while others are grumpy and sometimes even rude. i usually come here with large parties and i think large parties truly test the skills of server; skills which  quite frankly  bj's servers often lack. for that reason and for their lack of extraordinarily good food  i only give this place 3 stars. i'd give it less if it weren't for their delicious pizookies.
kara o.,Pleasanton  CA,62,25,,11/12/2010,2.0,It's never a good sign to go a restaurant and see someone throwing up in front.  I should have left at that point  buy unfortunately I stayed. I wasn't expecting much in the way of food  even though I had enjoyed BJs in San Mateo. I had a turkey burger which was good  but the fries tasted like they were made in old grease. The server was very friendly  but the service was incredibly slow. Perhaps they need more staff. PS the rest of the strip mall this is I is completely boarded up. I won't make the drive again.
Mai C.,San Francisco  CA,12,67,2,6/23/2013,3.0,I've been to this place a number of times  and it's always the same. The food is not bad  but the service is slow. We had to wait more than 15 minutes for anything and it took a while for our server to come around for us to order anything else. I had to ASK for a refill of my raspberry iced tea. It sounds stupid but I'm used to servers just refilling it before I ask. Overall  the food was good. The service just needs help.
Jim C.,San Jose  CA,39,238,117,1/28/2011,3.0,Hung out with my buds here  I tried the Grand Cru  good at first  but too sweet for my taste  I prefer their blonde b/c I'm a gentlemen. :-PNot sure what one of the lady ordered  it was some fruity cider  pass. Food was non eventful  in fact  I can't recall what we ate. We all finished and no one got sick  I guess I had a pint or two too much. Yeah  grab a brew and bond with your pals  watch a game  that's about it  I wouldn't come here for fine dining.
Mariah J.,Hayward  CA,1,14,,11/15/2014,2.0,the appetizers are still pretty good but the last few times I've been here the pizza hasn't been very good  there isn't much sauce and not very much toppings so it's been mainly bread and ya the breads good but thats not what I ordered I would like some pizza toppings with my pizza please.
Nancy T.,Newark  CA,1,4,,12/20/2011,2.0,The customer service here sucks balls. I've been here plenty of times for dinners  birthday dinners  lunches  and happy hour. If it wasn't for their awesome Jerry burst drinks  I wouldn't ever come back. Their wait time during dinner is horrible. The hostesses seem to always be confused and unwilling to do their jobs. Orders have been wrong numerous times. Their happy hour sucks. I'd rather go somewhere else for happy hour.The BJ's in Cupertino is 100000000x better than this one. Their customer service and cooks are on top of it. managers walk around making sure everything is okay and that you get your food on time. Newark BJ's needs to learn from them.
Rafael N.,Oakland  CA,23,152,12,1/17/2011,3.0,Just an average BJ??? Hey that's OK with me. Love the beer selections and the decor is palatable. Nice size TV above the bar. A bit of a wait cuz it gets busy. Menu is huge.... The best memory so far is a nice deep dish pizza and shrimp tacos. Worst memory was the donut thick battered Fish n Chips. Overall  a spot to get ur beak wet n munch n watch some tube deserves a 3.
David F.,Union City  CA,1372,159,2131,10/11/2010,3.0,Service is hit or miss here after being seated in a not so crowded bar area our waitress was assigned our table and another table all the way across the building. We waited 15 minutes to be served not a good experience. In the past we have had hit or miss experiences here but it is close to home and the good out weighs the bad experiences I guess. Plus nobody can touch the Oreo Pazookie!
Paul G.,Pescadero  CA,18,291,4,2/23/2013,1.0,"AWFUL....This is the third time I have tried this franchise. This time  we went to celebrate a birthday. We made reservations for 15 and thought we were good to go. First they had no reservation  The birthday girl of 93 years  had to wait an hour for a salad.....Everyone else had their food. The waitress said  ""I only have two hands."" We got a hamburger that we did not order  so the waitress took it back  and brought us back the same hamburger that was already cut in half  on a new bun. Our waitress never came back to refill our water glasses  or bus the old cocktail glasses that were building up on our table. The manager did come by and apologize  and offer to remove the hamburger off the bill. Oh  then they brought us plates and silverware for the birthday cake  and the silverware was soiled and dirty  very gross. Gorden Ramsey should visit this place....Do not waste your time at this place"
D Y.,San Jose  CA,45,1036,186,8/11/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,this time we had:1. crispy calamari - quite good. it came with both marinara and ranch sauce2. maui glazed porkchop with greens and potatoes - quite good too3. barbeque bison burger with slaw - quite good too4. sparkling raspberry drink - decent.
Cliff X.,Fremont  CA,534,32,,9/30/2010,4.0,Keyword - Brewhouse. First timers should try the beer sampler. they have 12% BEER! my all time fav is Jeremiah Red. RootBeer is also pretty Rad. Pizza - I recommend Mediterranean.Server - I recommend you sit at the bar. You'll be sitting there for a good 30 minutes longer for your dinner if you got waited on at the tables. Slow OR Busy. I think Bj's trains their servers to take that extra 30mins longer. Overall - Nice place  nice people  nice food  nice BEER  SLOW service (except bar) OH! and they have Rooster Sauce.
Amanda M.,Newark  CA,10,45,2,1/12/2011,4.0,Just have to say  I love the pizza here  the mini is just big enough for me! But  I fallow it up with a pizookie. So I leave feeling pretty stuffed! I don't really like the parking lot  its kind of cramped  and if Mervyns was still around the parking would be even worse. The inside is nice  lots of nice decor. If you're a sports fan there are like  5 flat screen tvs playing a variety of games. They're a little distracting in my opinion. Ive never had to wait more than 10 mins for a table  even on a busy night. The staff is great. I've always had a good server. Over all I'd recommend going here with friends  family or even a date ;-)
LPthang S.,Berkeley  CA,29,254,65,8/8/2013,1.0,I had a very horrible experience on Saint Patrick's Day. I ordered a pizza with out onions and it came out 45 minutes later with everything on it. Our waitress was very apologetic about it because she had the correct order. So  she sent it back to be corrected and it still came out wrong. So  I spoke with the manager and she had a nasty attitude. She said ' she would comp us half off since half was wrong! lol That is so crazy  and walked off. Thanks to the head chief who came and apologized with a gift card and wanted us to give them a second chance but  I must say ill pass...
Nicole G.,Austin  TX,456,72,1,4/4/2011,4.0,"Order ""Drink Like That"" - it has a lot of good stuff in it!I also love the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the Pizzookies!Expect to wait  because this place is always packed!"
Shequita C.,Livermore  CA,2,15,,8/13/2010,4.0,Yes  this place is kinda like a Cheesecake Factory/Elephant Bar. However  I'm not sure which came first  the Cheesecake or BJs. I was a little skeptical that a beautifully decorated warehouse like place can be placed around commerial building suicide. The food was good  The portion size of my shirmp pasta and my friends chicken salad was bountiful. One thing I didn't care too much for was their summer special - spiked Arnold Palmer. Next time  I'll stick with the brewski. I did have a belgium beer that was great. Lindeman Framboise.  Sweet!
Danielle S.,Sacramento  CA,59,4,1,7/26/2013,5.0,Surprised to see that there was a wait on a Thursday evening  but we were still seated pretty quickly. We had great food and great beer!! But the best part of the night was are great waitress Shantay !! She made our night great!! She had made sure were were happy and our drinks were always full !! She went out of her way to have a great conversation with us even thought it was a pretty busy night !! Ask for Shantay if you want to have a wonderful experience !!
K M.,Carmichael  CA,0,3,,11/24/2014,5.0,Great service  good tasting food  the Dessert took a little too long to come  but it was well worth it  the pizookies are AMAZINGLY  I love letting the ice cream harden a cookie a bit so it's crispy on the outside and squishy on the inside lol.
Jennifer H.,Fremont  CA,0,14,,8/10/2010,1.0,This place is trying way too hard to be like The Cheesecake Factory. First off  I really applaud them for being located in a completely deserted spot. Customers take up the restaurant parking lot AND the now defunct Mervyn's parking lot which means people must love this place. Don't know why..here's my reasons1.) The food is wayy too salty. Why must Americans like salty foods? Hello  there's a reason why you are overweight and have high blood pressure  America. In fact  if you're looking to come here for a simple and healthy meal..get your butt to Sweet Tomatoes. Even their salads here are loaded with crap..why call it a salad then? I got a soup in a bread bowl. Toooo salty and even the bread bowl was slathered with butter...eck2.) If you're looking for a nice and relaxing place..get lost. TV screens and super loud  playing sports games and other things AND if you come at a rather bad time  angry men shouting while spitting bits of BBQ wings out of their mouth. Not a good look people..3.) Service was pretty bad. Even when our drinks were getting pretty low  no one would ask for refills. It took a good 20 minutes or so to get reception and it wasn't even busy.I will definitely not be coming back here again..it was quite an awful experience. For a whole week  my body was feeling like crap.
Emily N.,Corvallis  OR,180,67,63,3/17/2013,5.0,Fantastic food  good quantity for the price  and great quality. Although you may have to wait quite a while to get seated  it is worth the wait. It is fantastic to have a decent restaurant in Newark!
Mary O.,Union City  CA,2,34,,9/3/2014,1.0,If I could give this restaurant Zero stars I would. I have worked as a server for 8.5 years of my life and I've lived between the states of Louisiana and California and I have never in my life had worst service than I did tonight. I was ONE of my servers TWO tables and Ravinder K  our server  did not refill our drinks one single time. In fact  we asked the manager after 45 minutes if our salads were coming out before he brought them out  as well as refilling out waters after they sat empty for 20+ minutes. My mixed drink tasted like cough syrup  not that our server asked at all to see how our drinks or entree's were. Also  2 of our guests ordered broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl  only to wait 50 minutes to get Clam chowder in a bread bowl. When they let the manager know they ordered broccoli cheddar he said he'd have it fixed in a moment only to come out 5-10 minutes later to inform them that the cooks made a mistake and they had no more bread bowls but they he could bring them a small bowl of soup and remove the two soups from the bill. So we sat there for over 2 hours  got most of our entrees messed up  as well as no refills  and the soups also never came. The manager didn't apologize  neither did the server who looked stunned when I informed her that this was by far the worst service I'd ever received. She seemed to not care about the entire situation. My friend's entire bowling team has come here for years  and after tonight you've completely lost 8-10 guests every Tuesday night.
Meshell C.,Oakland  CA,149,413,484,7/10/2010,2.0,If I could rate the service alone  it would only deserve ONE star. The waitress repeatedly forgets to bring us our things. My brother had to wait for his beer the longest. She had to be constantly reminded about the food (not bringing the fries). Then she forgets to add avocado on one of the burgers. At the end  she doesn't even asks if we wanted anything else and just handed us our bill...umm  actually  we wanted dessert! Anyways  the service was horrible  and then the manager came at the end to apologize for the wrong order and offered to have avocados added when we were already done w/ the meal. Pointless!The food was as expected...the California burger was somewhat bland. i had the Roast Turkey club and it was good. The classic burger was fine. My nephew had the Mac n Cheese which he thoroughly enjoyed. The place had plenty of TV's around so that was good to catch up on sports  but not enough for me to be entertained when I'm constantly annoyed by the horrible service.
Neha S.,Fremont  CA,17,27,6,8/25/2014,4.0,Great place to hang out  have some good appetizers  pizzas and chill. The waiters dont rush you at all once seated. Reservations are a must unless you dont mind standing in line for 20 mins! Pizooki dessert is amazing! !
Jennifer K.,Oakland  CA,11,86,,6/26/2011,4.0,My family and I love happy hour here and that's saying a lot when you can get my parents on board. =)We love it so much that my husband and I had our rehearsal dinner at this location and we were very happy with the value of the party catering service! It was all you can eat pizzas  apps and salads. Too bad it was the night before my wedding because my bridesmaids and I were trying to not eat that much  otherwise we would have seriously gotten our grub on.
David P.,Oakland  CA,201,35,20,6/25/2011,3.0,I hate the wait at this place  It's as bad as the one in San Bruno.Happy hour usually has people standing and waiting to vulture the next table available around the bar when your not looking. But you can always go off the side of the bar and ask the bartender to get you a beer at the HH rate (thats only BJ's beers btw.)Pizookie is the bomb with a Nitro porter  and the main entrees are ok. Go when its not to crowded  you'll thank me in the long run.
Katherine L.,Milpitas  CA,11,28,18,6/22/2011,5.0,I love this place  especially for lunch. This is my second time coming to this location (I've been to the BJ's in Cupertino twice) and haven't had a complaint yet.Parking is never an issue because they share the lot with a closed down Mervyn's. Both times that I have gone here for lunch  we get seated immediately. Our waiter gave us ample time to decide what to order and the food came out pretty quickly.Since it's a brewery  I always like to order a beer with my meal. Usually I get the Jeremiah Red (nice and low on the hops flavor)  but this time I tried their seasonal beer the Nitwit (like Blue Moon but packed with more flavor). I definitely want to come back and get it again.For food  my friend and I split the Ahi Poke  and I got the lunch size of the Italian Market salad. I loved the Ahi Poke  and it's a must order if you like avocado and sashimi-style tuna. Usually the salads are around $11  but for lunch they're only $8 (and still just as huge and filling!). This time  I think the salad was a little heavy on the dressing  but if you like a little bit of everything the Italian Market salad is delicious.And if you still have a little room and want to indulge  get a Pizookie! We knew we probably couldn't finish a whole one  so we ordered a small red velvet Pizookie  instead  and it was perfect.
Rich A.,Los Angeles  CA,121,26,,5/3/2011,4.0,"Came here for a birthday.Great staff. Very attentive...and not to say  the waitresses (at least the ones who assisted me) were absolutely attractive!Jameson shots all night  made a very cranky Rich in the morning. But hey  ""live in the present"" right?Answer to your question...Hell yes  I would come back...and this time get a White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Pizookie."
Surge C.,San Diego  CA,305,588,1302,1/7/2011,4.0,In comparison to the BJ's in San Bruno's  this one is amazing! I have never had an issue with the service and the staff is always very welcoming. My order is taken fast  food delivered fast  and drinks made perfectly. I love getting the pear cider here!
Alan A.,Fremont  CA,4,318,29,2/15/2011,3.0,I do like the atomosphere of this restaurant/ sportsbar. The place is big  trendy  and there are a lot of flat screen televisions that dot the walls. As for the food taste  it is spotty. I have had good meals and not so good meals here. My most recent dish was the Chicken Parmegana. This was one of the dishes that I would not order again. They gave you plenty of chicken draped over Spaghetti; however  the chicken did not taste that great. Instead of allowing it to go to waste  I forced myself to clear my plate.As I said earlier  the taste of the different dishes that I've had were hit and miss  but none of them have been horribly bad. Where customer service is concerned  it has always been superb. If you are looking for a trendy place to hang out for drinks with friends  or you are in search of a so so meal  I would definitely give this place a try.
Sloane T.,Los Angeles  CA,11,33,12,8/11/2012,2.0,Visited on 7 Aug 2012:Let's see  where do I start. Oh yeah  waiting for about 30 minutes only to find out the beeper they gave me was broken. Okay  fine  I asked if we could get something complimentary as payback? They said free appetizers. Cool. Got menus  waited a bit longer than normal for the waiter to take our order  but finally did. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Then they came  soon followed by the soup that I ordered for DINNER. I asked if they could hold on to it for me as we'd just gotten the appetizers. Okay. Appetizers were good. Then we waited for the main course. And waited. And waited. And waited. Finally the dinners came  all of them  that is  except for our daughter's  whose birthday dinner it was. Also  husband's pasta  which he ordered with the red peppers on the side  came with the peppers in the pasta  and then some. He couldn't even eat it  it was so hot (and he's from India!). After about 15 minutes of no dinner for birthday girl  I got our waiter and told him about that as well as the volcano pasta. He was very nice  and took it away (husband didn't want anything else). Finally daughter's dinner came. I complained so much to the waiter that he got the manager  who I must say showed excellent customer service. In fact  the service people are very good  very nice  and courteous. I don't blame them for any of this (except  maybe  the early soup). The manager greatly reduced our bill  and gave a free pizookee combo dish (huge!)  on the house. Not sure when I'll be back  though. With all the wait time  we were in that place for more than two-and-a-half hours.
Kayla H.,Fremont  CA,0,2,,9/21/2012,4.0,After hearing about BJ's so much I finally decided to head on over for dinner on a Friday night to see what all the buzz was about  I went with a friend. When I first entered BJ's I was very impressed by the atmosphere. The wait staff are professionally dressed and nicely combed. Besides that  BJ's is a nice place to have dinner and a couple drinks with friends or family. Its comfortable and you can come casually dressed.The food is delicious and very aesthetically appealing and their brew's are pleasant and good with what's on the menu.The only problem I had when I went was that it took almost 45 minutes to bring out the dessert. Other than that  I would go here again.
Sudhakar K.,San Jose  CA,2,41,21,8/1/2013,4.0,Except for the long waits  this place is the best place (probably the only one) that stays open late night in the Fremont area. I love their Jermiah !
Sahar R.,Fremont  CA,7,62,44,8/20/2012,2.0,Service here is terrible every time I have gone in a group. It's like they know gratuity is included (mandatory in groups) and stop caring about the fact that you're trying to enjoy your dining experience.
Ashley P.,Fremont  CA,16,24,,6/16/2012,4.0,The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my fav! What's even better is that I have leftovers the next day!
Enza P.,Milpitas  CA,603,575,344,12/18/2010,4.0,I really like the overall vibe of BJ's. It's always dimly lit inside with great decor  which puts me in a relaxed mood. I've been to this location several times before and I am generally happy about everything.This last time I went  was with 4 friends. 2 of my friends ordered beer and really enjoyed it (they have a crazy beer menu). My other friend got some kind of cider that was really tasty too. I'm definitely ordering that next time.We didn't get appetizers but for my entree I ordered the jambalaya. Instead of eating it with rice I subbed it for pasta  which tasted great. I wish they gave me more sauce  but that's probably why you're supposed to eat it with rice haha. My friends ordered a pizza  side of potato skins  and a sandwich. Everyone loved their food. For dessert  we had a sampler style pizookie.You get 3 mini pizookies with your choice of flavors. We ordered 2 oreo and 1 macadamia. I LOVED THE OREO ONE. OH MY GOODNESS. They put a little creme on the side too in addition to the ice cream that made it more oreo-like. The chocolate cookie was surprisingly not too chocolate-y which I was ecstatic about. All I do is dream of the oreo pizookie nowadays.I love everything about this place except that time you wait for you food. I takes FOREVER for food and sometimes drinks to come out. I don't blame the waiter for the food  whoever cooks the food sure takes their time. I would still come back because I do enjoy the service as well as the food. It's a bit on the pricier side but I still love it.
Ronaldo R.,Alameda  CA,50,7,,8/19/2012,2.0,Rude service. I was standing at the bar waiting to get a drink. Area was congested and servers had trouble getting through  one of the servers pushed me out the way without saying excuse me or even saying sorry. Service sucks
Jozelle D.,San Jose  CA,129,97,24,3/23/2010,2.0,**********Sign up for BJ's e-mail list to automatically receive your FREE birthday Pizookie. Sign up @ the restaurant or online!**********STOP! LOOK FOR THE NEXT AVAILABLE BJ'S!I don't really like this particular location only because the wait was so hecka looooong! I've eaten here once and attempted to eat here two other times. They're always so packed  which is a good thing for them but not for the hungry customer. I mean seriously...you let me down BJ's. I tried to bring my parents in for some grub one night so they could try the famous pizookie for the first time...but filipino parents don't like to wait  and wait long for that matter. -_- Despite all that  the pizookie is still the shiz and I'd come back...maybe at a different location though.
Linda C.,San Leandro  CA,145,441,1,1/3/2010,1.0,"Just call me Shaniqua C.I think I should have insisted on not settling on this place for even a casual holiday dinner. Something told me that I would regret eating here or something would piss me off majorly about this place...and boy should I listen to my intuition...THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. Now  most of you will ask: so what? Granted  there are many places with good food and bad service that I will tolerate because the food is just that damn good...here...not so much. The wait was long  but we dealt with it because it was during the holiday season  but come to think of it  every time i try to patronize this place  the wait is always one hour MINIMUM. Sorry  I won\'t even wait that long for some places with MUCH better food...Walking us to the table  our hostess did not even NOTICE that in the process of carrying a PILE of presents  that I had slipped on a GREASE SPOT that hadn\'t been mopped up properly.EVEN WORSE  she proceeded to smile weakly at me and say ""Oh  our floors are always like that!"" THEN...WALKS AWAY. !??!!?!??!?!OH HELL NAW. NO YOU DI\'NT!The ghetto queen inside me gets unleashed and I ask our waitress (who  by the way  was totally NICE) to get the manager. He comes  and I unleash the fury that is SHANIQUA C. (aka Linda C) and apparently I give him enough shit for him to go back to the hostess table and dish out some hell himself. And yeah  he should. What if I was pregnant?! What if I had existing health problems that were compounded by that fall? I mean really  people have sued for a LOT less  and these chain restaurants are the first choice for lawsuits  so don\'t you think they would have CARED a little bit more? The manager took my name and number but he has not called as he said he would. Minus 10 million points. Sadly  the food wasn\'t bad  but the service is SHITTY  SHITTY  SHITTY - and enough to make me never wanna come here again. To be FAIR  the food was decent and I ended up still have a good time with friends despite the nasty and MASSIVE 3 inch x 3 inch bruise I ended up with for 2 weeks. All in all  there is NO EXCUSE for a chain restaurant of this size to have service this shitty  and for this reason  I will never ever come to this BJ\'s again."
Briggitte L.,Hayward  CA,0,36,3,4/6/2014,2.0,My daughter and I went to BJs with a friend a couple of weeks ago. It was an overall good experience. My daughter ordered the standard chicken tenders & french fries (hard to mess that up). I ordered a new fish dish. It was so bland that I cannot even remember what it was. My friend ordered a salad and she liked it. When we first arrived we had a friendly  energetic server. He was very attentive. But he went on break before we got our meal and his replacement had the personality of a rock. She barely spoke above a whisper. A couple of times my friend and I had to ask each other what she'd said. She also was not nearly as attentive as the male server. She pretty much ignored us after we received our entree. We had to hunt her down to order dessert. The cookie was delicious as always. My daughter thought that her entire meal was awesome. My friend seemed to like her meal better than I did too. One more thing  I wish the waiters at BJ's would bring fresh glasses for refills instead of taking the glass that the customer is using. It is highly likely that they will mix up glasses as they refill in the kitchen and you will end up with someone else's glass.
S A.,Sunnyvale  CA,5,54,5,3/18/2013,4.0,If you want to indulge - this is the place :)We tried the stuffed mushrooms - yum!Next was Bruschetta - yum again!Also I liked that the portions weren't too big. We had gone for brunch and I had the BJ's Special brunch and my husband had the chicken sandwich. Both were really nice.We tried the salad and berry crumble in our next visit and both were great!It's just that the calorie count really sucks :(
kelly e.,Newark  CA,0,8,3,2/22/2014,1.0,"I have been to BJ\'s on multiple occasions in different areas. This was the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant the I\'ve been too. I have been in the industry for 14years and have a lot of patience but this one takes the cake!!! Danielle B in Newark was one of the worst servers I have ever had. We first waited for 5 minutes for anyone to say hello. I did appreciate that she came and said "" I appreciate your patience"". We had very little interaction with her and when our food came we had no silverware. We were half way through or meal before anyone checked on us..Good thing the food was good! I will give you that! When we first ordered we asked her to put in a to go order and when we were done she dropped the bill with no To go. I asked her about it and she did admit that she forgot! I appreciated her honesty and told us it would be 5 minutes. 25 minutes later she came back with our to go  no discount or even a sorry. All that was said was ""I\'ll take your check"" which we weren\'t ready to give. I  as a server understand that things happen  but it is my job to try to make sure the guest comes back. There was nothing she did that made us feel welcomed back or that she even wanted us to return   and we won\'t!!! YOURE SERVERS ARE TOO STRECHED AND CAN\'T HANDLE THEIR SECTIONS!! FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A YELP REVIEW IN MY LIFE BECUASE I FEEL THEY ONLY COME FROM ANGERY GUESTS..BUT I HOPE YOU WORK ON YOUR TRAINING AND GUEST SATTISFACTION. YOU ARE BETTER THEN THIS!!!"
Sandra C.,Fremont  CA,93,15,3,6/16/2011,2.0,Called to see what time happy hour was and the guy hung up on me after saying the hours. I knew this place sucked (speaking of this one specifically) but I would think they'd at least wait til you got in the door to be rude to you.
Natalie L.,Fremont  CA,20,6,,4/19/2013,4.0,My Favorite restaurant around town with yummy food and drinks. Great restaurant to bring the kids with as well.Always great service when eating there only downfall in takeout service is not as good. Take out always takes longer then they said and 50% of the time my order is either incomplete or just completely wrong so I would advise to only dine in.
Priscilla S.,Castro Valley  CA,148,172,28,10/20/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Ate here over the weekend with some friends. Although we still had issues and miscommunication from the reservation staff  the actual service during our meal was pretty good and the food wasn't so bad (way better than Fridays). The place was packed because of the Giants game yet it didn't feel cramped inside. I'd go back again but try to avoid calling ahead at all costs cause that itself will give you a bad experience.
Bill F.,Fremont  CA,28,275,44,12/13/2009,4.0,"I came here to pick-up my son and his friend because they were there after a school function to get something to eat and socialize. I arrived a early but they want to socialize more before heading home. Therefore  I went to the bar to sit and get something to drink.It was late  about 11:30 when I went into the bar and it was still half-full. I looked at the drink menu and saw that they had a extensive menu of mixed drinks and beer on tap. Afterwards  I ordered a drink and watched some of the action on the television over the bar. The bar was impressive with the displays of bottled liquor and the bar taps displaying the various beers. I even saw the people next to me ask for a sample of one of the beer offerings - which is something I did not know was possible!I sat at the bar for a while until my son and his friend were ready to go home. Service from the employees was impressive. It was quick  efficient and friendly. They also checked on me every once-in-a-while to see if I needed anything else. Too bad I could not drink a too much that evening because I needed to get the ""Young Ones"" home safely!It was a great experience and I will be sure to go back for a pizza and a glass of wine without the kids but with the girlfriend (wife  also)."
Diana L.,Newark  CA,10,57,8,2/20/2012,5.0,BJ's is by far one of my favorite brewery's. I give their beer  food and service 5 stars for several reasons. I've been here quite a few times and it never fails. We are always greeted by friendly staff. The waiters/ress are always very attentive and on point. I love coming here for their savory fresh Ahi Poke. It's chopped sashimi Ahi marinated in poke sauce with diced avocado. The Ahi is served with crispy wonton chips- so delicious. I've also tried their chicken noodle soup and the minestrone. They're both nothing special  but do their job as fillers. Their pear ciders are also quite delicious. If you love ciders  try the pear cider! Not the biggest fan of the berry pear cider because it's too sweet! The Margherita Fresca (has mozzarella  tomato sauce  fresh basil and parmesan cheese) and California Club (bacon  chicken  tomato & garlic aioli) flat bread pizzas are amazing! They are both crispy  fresh and flavorsome. I would recommend sharing appetizers and plates with your table to try different plates. Their BJ's Cobb Salad is also fresh and delicious!If you plan on going on a Friday or Saturday evening (or during a game)  plan on waiting at the very minimum 1 hour. They are always packed- which in my opinion  is a great sign. They have a full bar and flat screen TV's all over. The place is loud with dim lights  but I love it! Plenty of parking too. Their prices are reasonable  but be careful when ordering pitcher  after pitcher... it can add up! ;)
Anthony S.,San Leandro  CA,51,34,38,12/8/2010,4.0,while attending a kids circus at the nearby mall  I had opportunity to try this location as my first BJ's. it was a weekend evening and I found the short wait no issue  host and initial contact service was admirable. multiple flatscreens made ease of sports view and kept me from playinf espn on my phone  which makes momma happy. C'mon  it it a brewery so beer was a must for a guy like me. I tried the taster mix  and was duly delighted with the choices I made. overall food selection was a plus  even with the kids. all of our dishes were a hit  and the total cost with drinks and dinner for a group of 4 was under 60$ Assuming BJ's is a chain style unit  I would easily say popping into one on my road travel by chance of just seeing it would be a YES....
Maria M.,Fremont  CA,11,20,3,2/9/2011,3.0,Walked inside and it has a niiice atmosphere. The workers were super friendly (even the ones that were outside taking their break were welcoming)and the food is pretty good.
Chelsea O.,El Dorado Hills  CA,90,5,,7/16/2012,1.0,The food and drinks were good  but the service was horrendous. My group came here for a little surprise dinner for our friend's birthday & engagement. I had called the day before and made reservations with a manager. To my surprise  when we got to the restaurant they did not have my reservation. I was visibly upset and a little frantic as I was concerned that we wouldn't be able to pull off the surprise  but the hostesses didn't give me any information on when a table would be ready for me... they just gave me the little light up thing and told me it would light up when the table was ready. My friends and I went to the bar and sat there for 20 minutes and our table was still not ready. I went back to the hostess stand and explained the situation that this is a surprise party and the guest of honor will be arriving in 8 minutes. I asked for the manager  and they told me that they already talked to the manager and he said I didn't have a reservation. Their whole attitude was very nonchalant. It was obvious that they did not care about our situation that we were in because of their incompetence. Eventually we did get a table in the nick of time (thankfully the guest of honor was running late). Once we were sat we didn't see our waitress  Courtney  for a while. We were sitting their with empty glasses for a good 20 minutes before we could even find her to get another. I can say that she was probably one of the worst servers that we have ever had. She was absent the whole time  rarely checked up on us  NEVER refilled our waters  and was completely rude whenever she was at the table. The only time she was quick to get to the table was when she came to get our money and the gratuity that she absolutely did not deserve. The management at this restaurant is terrible. Brenda  the manger i spoke with when i made my reservation is obviously incompetent. There is another woman manager (blond) who was on duty when i was there was either completely aloof of the situation  or lacked the managerial skills to do anything about it. There was a male manager on as well  he was better than the other two... but could definitely use some customer service training. All in all  I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. BJ's has great food and drinks  but this specific location has terrible service and worse management. Good side: The brunette bartender was very kind and attentive and made fantastic drinks. Thank you for that.
Daniel D.,Fremont  CA,649,44,132,11/21/2012,2.0,"Came here for a late dinner and had an interesting experience. My expectations when it comes to dining are held at a higher level when it comes to BJ\'s. We were seated fairly quickly  helped out right away  and everything was going smoothly. One thing about his location that caused it to earn two stars was the fact that everything takes forever. After ordering and waiting 45 minutes for our food we were then approached by the waiter who let us know that both orders were messed up (baked potato was cooked wrong and my cajun pasta was taken to the wrong table). Cool  as long as they were being transparent and honest. Still sucked having this mix up though. We finally got our food after waiting about an hour and 15 minutes. I had become very impatient. Food was good  still prefer The Cheesecake Factory\'s cajun pasta over BJ\'s but still good. The waiter was cool though and she went out of her way to ""talk to her manager"" to get us a discount on our bill for the long wait. Awesome! Not so much  after waiting for our bill for another 15-20 minutes  we were told that we were going to get 50% off the baked potato  the pepsi  and the Shrimp Cajun Pasta. That\'s not what the bill reflected though! We got half off the baked potato and pepsi (the two cheapest items on the bill) and only $0.85 off of the pasta lol I didn\'t even bother trying to have them correct it  I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. I definitely should have said something but why should I? If they are trying to make my dining experience better than what it was then those things should have been doubled checked. Meh. I\'ve experienced better."
Kelly L.,Fremont  CA,6,36,16,7/9/2013,4.0,When I had a sleepover at my house  my parents took me and my friend here. It was really fun and pretty nice inside. The food was pretty good. Very similar to what you would find at Elephant Bar or Claim Jumper! Homie:P
Vampire J.,Alameda  CA,10,60,52,12/24/2012,5.0,What a great experience! Great food and service! OMG so full after... They make root beer that is extremely yummy  i have been here twice now the wait is worth it! The food is sooooo good here. You must save room for a pizzookie it's a signature dessert that also benefits children with cystic fibrosis.
Vanessa A.,San Jose  CA,3,18,5,3/8/2013,4.0,Love this place! This is my go-to chain restaurant. It's cool and a fun place to be. I haven't found a dish I haven't liked. California burger  chicken fried steak  broccoli cheddar soup  Pizookie!! The list goes on. The wait sucks. This place is always busy (weekday and especially on weekends).  However you can always call first and the wait is totally worth it.
Sasitorn O.,Oakland  CA,49,198,520,2/16/2010,3.0,After spending Valentine's weekend at Big Sur and on the way heading back home  we decided to grab pizza and this place was on the way.When i heard of this restaurant  for some reason i can't stop smiling ( maybe i think in negative way :P ) However  we totally forgot the day we went was Valentine's day. It was a bit long line  I have told to be waiting about at least 35 - 40 mins but the line was faster than i thought. We got a great seat for just two of us. We started with beer and strawberry margarita  which just ok for me.Food : First  Avocado egg rolls was a great starter.      Caesar salad was just ok  like other places.      Our pizza made with Mushroom  onion  pepperoni  artichoke      heart  roasted garlic  and fresh basil which was good. Service : was fine.
Susan N.,San Anselmo  CA,6,118,7,11/6/2012,3.0,You know how it is  chain restaurant...blandish food. But sometimes you're hungry  and it comes out piping hot and next thing you know  the greasy food is gone! Their pumpkin ale is pretty good though! Surprising for a chain brewery.
mike l.,Fremont  CA,41,59,,12/29/2009,4.0,PROs:- Good quality food. Better than Elephant Bar in my opinion. - Deep dish pizzas are great.- Avacado egg rolls are off the hook.- During happy hour  you get half off of all appetizers and a few bucks off of your drinks which isn't bad at all.CONs:- It will probably take you at LEAST 45 minutes to an hour to get a table  even for two people. Your best bet is to get your name on the waiting list  grab the little vibrating thing  and hang out at the bar. If you see a bar table or spot open up  just hop on it and order your food from there. It's a lot faster.That's about it. Fair prices  good food. 4 stars.
Curtis C.,San Mateo  CA,131,212,3,9/26/2010,1.0,"I dont want to rant but this place had terrible service. We went there after a late night with it being packed late midweek night. We were seated promptly with the hostess very nice but once we got seated  we seriously waited thirty minutes and still no service and had to wave down a waiter to reseat us. We got ok service after that. I got the salmon but it was overcooked. Even though there is nothing to eat here in Fremont  i will never eat here again due to the TERRIBLE service and the barely above par food.btw  their ""signature oktoberfest beer"" was out too. Double slap to the face."
Ken J.,Fremont  CA,27,144,,10/31/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I am moving this to 4 stars because of their menu  and their beer. Gluten free Pizza is the favorite of my friend. I did NOT like thei r avocado egg roll... wierd flavor didn't work for me. Didn't particularly like their lettuce cups wither... but there is so much to explore and they have a nice bar. I would encourage others to go.
Jay H.,San Jose  CA,0,4,,10/11/2014,1.0,Bartenders tend to have tunnel vision here and they have a hard time finding the game on TV people want to see then they change channels out of nowhere. I won't be back.
Wes O.,Hayward  CA,50,63,,10/5/2009,2.0,"This review hurts a little. This night  I lost something very near and dear to me  and ""PROBABLY"" has little to do with BJ\'s itself. [Begin rap]Crusing down the street in my 6-6/bumping the beat  ignoring the chicks/Went to BJ\'s to get some food/nuckle heads out there cold acting a fool/I saw the haters so i cut down my bass/then I parked my ride in a safe ass place/took off my steering wheel off and walked on in/walked by a punk muthafucka with a devilish grin/I felt the hate  but proceeded to stay/I ordered my food but it was only ok/one hour later I walk outside/some punk muthafucka done stole my ride/Cause the boys in the hood are always hard/eat at BJ\'s you might lose you car/knowing nothing in life  except being legit/dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit/"
Larry M.,Livermore  CA,1,21,,5/30/2013,2.0,Average service and attention to my gluten free needs  but the first steak I ordered was stringy and couldn't be cut with their steak knife. String beans were over cooked  salad was wilted. New steak and string beans much better  yet lacking flavor on a boneless ribeye. Tasted like no seasoning was used in the preparation. Re-fire on steak was relatively quick and without much argument. Service was not bad until my brother ordered a takeout order for his son and we ordered dessert. 20 minutes later after flagging the manager  we got both. Gluten free? Day after results  not good on the gluten free issue. I would question whether celiacs should dine here. Mixed bag here. Had much better experience at the Salinas location.
Patrick D.,Newark  CA,0,12,5,7/29/2011,2.0,Oh god  did they have to put it right next to a free way???!!! Scenario check/theory: let's say you are a parent of 2 or more children. You live somewhere in Oregon and you decided to take the family down to Disneyland or whatever by car. You children are being little $&^$ (profanity) Whining that they are hungry and what not. You see a sign for a small city named Newark Ca.  and a glimpse of a restraunt just beyond that. What is a caring parent's first reaction? That is Bjs main problem. It is too crowded! Other than that  good food  bad service  and all around  a 2star rating.
A W.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,19,,5/21/2012,2.0,I'm a vegetarian so I ordered a deep dish veggie pizza. I've been here on three separate occasions and each time they managed to mess up my meal. It says Vegetarian for a reason  yet they somehow keep managing to shove meat under the cheese or in the crust. the first two times I told the waiter  the manager came over said how sorry he was and gave me another veggie pizza for free (luckily this time with no meat). Didn't have to pay for either veggie pizza. The third time a manager (not sure if it was the same one or not)  but he brought me a replacement with no meat  yet when the bill came he said he gave me the replacement free  and still made me pay! for their screw up!I will not be going here ever again. It's pretty serious if they can't get a simple veggie pizza right. If someone was allergic to that meat or if it was some other ingredient they hid in the pizza someone had an allergy to  I'm sure they wouldn't be open anymore.
Keleka C.,San Jose  CA,11,73,15,10/4/2010,5.0,This year for my daughter's birthday dinner  we decided to have it at BJ's. Although I wasn't 100% about having to do the buffet for large parties due to the selection  I ended up very pleased in the long run. We went with their Signature dishes in which we were able to choose Chicken/Ribs  a pasta (Spaghetti)  four pizzas (BJs Classic  BJs Meat Pizza  the Mediterranean  and the Sweet Pig). I do have to say  the ribs were very very good! The meat pretty much fell off the bones!From the moment we walked in to the very end  the wait staff and managers on hand were very attentive. Drinks were always refilled  they brought the food out as instructed as well as the cupcakes when it came time. What's even great is that at the end of your allotted two hour time  you can take whatever is out in the buffet home. So  we had everyone take some food home.The only thing I wished they had was a private room for parties at this location. Other than that  I would definitely have another large party or event here at this particular BJs. The price is definitely worth every penny.
noah a.,Fremont  CA,1,125,14,9/30/2012,2.0,"In general BJ\'s isn\'t bad for a chain but this location somehow manages to screw up chain-wide recipes. They always skimp on pizza topping  don\'t give enough side dish  ""forget"" to bring out parts of your order etc. I sear they need to go through an audit by the chain and see how poorly they compare to other BJs. If you have a choice the new one out by Dublin/Pleasanton is MUCH better."
Ash P.,Hayward  CA,70,270,28,3/8/2012,2.0,Let's be real  I only come here for the pizookie and that's it! It's that good that I will wait an absurd amount of time to be seated. I have never had a great meal or service at any of their chains.
Thanh N.,  Japan,172,314,87,8/31/2010,3.0,I was so happy when they opened a Bj's in my area! I had been driving to San Mateo and Cupertino to eat their pizza for the longest time! My boyfriend and I would crave it once every two weeks. The service is 'ok'. I ordered togo a few times  and once we took the pizza home unsliced! I mean how does a pizza end up in the box unsliced?!..I was pretty mad since I had taken the pizza to a friend's house who lived in San Leandro and he didn't have anything to cut the pizza with. I called the restaurant to let them know it was unacceptable and the manager never got back to me as he said he would. He offered to cut the pizza if I drove back there. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I was now 13 miles away  it should have been cut from the beginning..I definitely was not going to drive back just to have a pizza cut! I spoke to another manager later  he was rude too.Overall  their food is yummy. So if you're looking for something new or you've never tried BJ's Brewhouse  you should give it a try. They sure won't disappoint your stomach.
Mike N.,Brentwood  CA,99,265,134,3/3/2010,3.0,The food here is hit or miss. Mostly miss. Learn how to cook a burger! When someone ask for medium  it means still a bit pink  not dry as hell and cooked all the way through! The service is ok. It's just a decent place to get a beer I suppose.Side Note: My brother did 10 loops in the parking lot until I asked him WTH? He said this place was notorious for having cars broken into and or stolen. He's got the inside scoop  he's a deputy.
Shirley N.,San Jose  CA,306,352,522,12/19/2011,4.0,I've been to this and their other locations quite a few times. Each experience was different. This review is for my last visit back in September for a friend's birthday. The wait was a bit long but it makes sense since it was a Friday night. Service is a hit or miss with chain restaurants like BJ's. We we're lucky and got a great server. Moving on to the food  I wanted something light that evening so i choose the maui glazed pork chop with roasted red potatoes  green beans and grilled onion. Super delicious and i didn't feel like crap after. I love that they didn't over-cook their pork. The rest of my friends seem to enjoy their food as well! We also got the beer sampler  not a huge fan of beer but its cool to try the different kinds! Our night ended with their original chocolate chip cookie pizookie! I'm not a fan of dessert after dinner but this is a MUST! I have yet to try their other pizookie's  maybe next time! Things I've tried in the past that i really liked--Chicken pesto flatbread pizza  Avocado eggrolls  mini bruschetta  grilled chicken potato  and their yummy thin fries! BJ's is a great place to have a birthday  enjoy a few drinks and have dinner with friends. Great selection of beer and food!
Aile M.,Fremont  CA,0,29,,3/26/2010,1.0,"I took my friend here on the 03.19.10  and I was a bit surprised that the restaurant was packed at 9:30pm  so I thought this place might be something else. I was thinking ""Awesome "" but it was a disappointment.I ordered an Angel Hair Pasta with shrimp  and my friend ordered something with meat on it. After ordering  I looked around in between conversations with my friend. The ambience of the restaurant was very modern and loud. Note  I do not mind the loudness at all. Huge TVs hung from the ceiling showing sports. By the time the order arrived  it was half an hour. Half an hour wait is a big no  no for me. Furthermore  the waitress messed up my order--the shrimp was missing in the pasta. The waitress apologized  and somehow it was understandable. The thing that got me was the part that she did not take the shrimp-less pasta  but rather gave me a plate of fried shrimps on a smaller plate 20 minutes later to be added to the pasta  ""BY MYSELF.""I added the shrimp thinking the pasta would somehow change my mood  but I was dead wrong. The pasta was bland  as if it was made for a diabetic. The sauce was hard to notice  and I even doubted that there was sauce in it. I was so frustrated that I just ate some of the fried shrimps and even that was not even good. On the other hand  my friend ordered a steak that was supposed to be medium  but arrived well done. My friend ate the thing anyway because he was so hungry that night and did not even have the strength to argue.We moved on to the dessert and ordered triple oreos  which took another half an hour. I was like ""What the @#$%!"" The dessert did not require any cooking. You just slap them together and serve  but it still took half an hour?In my opinion  just skip this place and go to another restaurant. McDonalds is alot better than this. I do not have anyone that I hated enough to send to this place and die of frustration and starvation. However  if you want to bring your most hated enemies  this is the place for you."
Arneb A.,Dublin  CA,5,16,,5/7/2013,5.0,Best restaurant to eat at! Amazing dessert especially the pazookie
Vanna S.,Fremont  CA,12,138,4,9/14/2010,3.0,"BFF\'s pick for her bday celebration and it was suppose to be a quick lunch before she gets back to work. I thought this would be great for me to scope it out before taking my husband for a beer treat.We went in after the lunch rush and this place looks pretty empty since it\'\'s so big. I mean there are people but it\'s so big it feels empty. We sat ourselves (since there was no one to take us to the table) in the bar area\'s cozy booth and was greeted by our server  Karla  few minutes later.We made our order of Root Beer - pretty good  but lacking something  served in ice cold mug.Chicken Wings - nice crispy skin and and moist with 2 sauces and celery sticks served on the side. perfectly cooked without being too messy  you can put as much sauce as you like. BJ\'s Favorite Mini Pizza - combination of yellow onion  bell pepper  sausage  peperoni  tomato and olives. it was suppose to be deep dish pizza and it\'s nothing special. I guess if you have a few  yeah  it\'s good  it won\'t matter anyway  right?Our server was pretty forgetful for not having a very busy service. We asked for straws and she forgot and when we finally asked another server for it  the straws shows up. Our food shows up and we had no utensils or napkins. We helped ourselves with the napkins for the empty table next to us. I witness the table behind also grabbed napkin utensils wrap from another empty table. Our server was nice  but not very thoughtful.The ambiance and prices are very favorable. The Chicken Wings was not bad and the Pizza was just ok  meh. Need I talk about the service any more?Over all this place really deserves 2.5 star and I just rounded up. So a ""meh ok""."
Dean Z.,Fremont  CA,7,34,,1/6/2013,1.0,Let me start of by telling you that I cant remember one good experience that I have had here. The service is HORRIBLE! The only thing that keeps me coming back are the large assortments of sports on their many tvs. Think twice before coming here
Elise G.,San Jose  CA,166,890,2241,11/22/2010,4.0,I like the setup of this BJ's better than those in Cupertino and San Jose. The bar is dim  cozy  and inviting. The backdrop is a puzzle of different flat screens displaying sports and there is plenty of seating in the bar area. The pub tables are close enough to the bar top to be near friends and watch the games. And there are booths available in the same area too. I like that it's quieter than the other BJ's I've been to. The place is pretty big. There's no doubt that it can accommodate a lot of people. But the ceilings are high so the noise travels upward and the layout makes the restaurant feel less cramped. I would come back again just for the environment. As far as food goes  it's pretty consistent with other BJ's chains. The Pazookie is a memorable must. Between four of us  we split the sampler with 3 different cookie pies topped with vanilla ice cream. Of course that was after the hoard of appetizers we ordered.We got: Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps  Santa Fe Spring Rolls  Chicken Wings  Mini Tacos  Crispy Fried Artichokes  Stuffed Mushrooms  Crisp Potato Skins  BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders  and Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage Flat Bread Pizza.My top 3: 1. I liked the BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders the best. The sauce was flavorful and it came with fried onion strings inside. 2. The Chicken wings were the best I've had in the area. I like that they weren't saturated in sauce  the skin had a nice texture to them  and the meat was moist.3. Santa Fe Spring Rolls: They were just plain tasty. I liked the crispiness of the outside and how they were skinny and bite size so they didn't feel heavy.The beer was really good. There's such a variety and there's a lot on tap. My boyfriend ordered a bunch of different types in an attempt to work his way down the beer list. I sampled his light and dark Belgian beers in a bottle and was pleased with both. We'll be back again. It was a great place to watch football at the bar over some good food and good beer.
Jonathan M.,Lancaster  CA,0,8,,3/31/2010,1.0,"Strike 1:I had a reservation of 20 people. When we got there  there was 8 people. they said we can\'t sit yet because they need at least half of us to be present. we were short 2 people so they made us wait for 30 min. then they finally said  ""come on in."" AFTER FREEZING!!!Strike 2:Upon arrival of my family  they asked where my party was. The lady said  those asians on the back is your group. my white cousins didn\'t appreciate the comment.Strike 3:Some paid cash and some with card. I placed my card last instructing our server to bill the rest on my card. When we got the bill back  they charged almost all of the expenses on my card. I thought most people didn\'t pay so i let it go. Found out that the server TOOK ALL THE CASH and only charged the expenses on the card. Now its too late because there\'s no proof that we paid cash. Lesson learned  don\'t be fooled when your busy and occupied. people take advantage of the situation. I admit it was partly my fault  but isn\'t that why we have a server? To serve not to fool?"
Yen H.,Fremont  CA,199,82,178,10/11/2010,4.0,The first few times that I've been to BJs was at the Cupertino location and I hated it...The ambiance and service wasn't bad but I hated the food. I honestly didn't like any of their dishes. Now that BJs has arrived to Newark which is closer to my place  I was able to try it out a few more times  especially during happy hour with my friends. I used to not like their avocado eggrolls  which everyone else and their momma loved  but now I heart them as well! Hey  it only took about 5 tries or so but now i'm addicted! I like how the avocado chunks are nice and warm...I especially love the sauce that comes with them.The food here is A-Okay. Nothing special but their portions are big. I realize that I don't like how they make their drinks...except for maybe the strawberry splash but I always have to ask for extra strawberries.It's a good place for a group of friends or family to get together and enjoy each others' company.
Anna C.,San Leandro  CA,2,12,2,6/17/2014,1.0,I went on a friend date awhile ago here and now that I have a yelp account I can give me review. I ordered Alfredo pasta with broccoli which was ok nothing special I don't really like their pizza this just seems like a cool place to chill with a group of people and get your drink on. So as we get into our car to leave we got followed by the security rent a cop man who stared us down until he got close to our car. He proceeded to tell us we hadn't paid for our meal! I know for a fact we did since I paid half. He literally tried to open our door and act like he was doing a citizen arrest and as the situation was about to get real a waiter runs out and yells out they found the money it was under the bill! The rent a cop tried to shake my friends hand but we were so offended by his embarrassing assumption my friend made him back up and slammed the door on his face and we got out of there ASAP never again!!!! They should've paid us for the chef boyardee meal we ate and the bullshit we had to go through after. The end.
Manny M.,Castro Valley  CA,15,147,9,4/26/2012,4.0,Came here for dinner last nite (first time) around 6:30pm and it was pretty crowded for a Wed. We were seated in 10 min. not bad for 3 of us. We started off with the fried artichoke hearts which were tasty  my uncle had the pork chops  my wife had the seared ahi tuna salad  and I had the ribeye w/ mash tators. We were very pleased with the food and service. On a con  lower the music so no one is screaming to get heard in a conversation  I know it's hard for today's society to converse when their face is plastered to the phone  some of us DO talk though. Parking is ok  looks like Picasso painted the lot.
April G.,Newark  CA,12,7,3,2/25/2010,1.0,I have to agree with most of the yelpers about this place. The service is HORRIBLE! First time I went my friends and I went straight to the bar. And our bartender was really nice and checked up on us everyonce in awhile.! I don't know his name  but he makes good drinks and nice! So the first wasnt so bad....But the second trip we decided to get a table  the hostess was able to sit us immediately which is kinda nice. But it took the server 20 MINUTES to approach us? Seriously? The server was rude on top of that. The service at Elephant bar is better than BJ's! If I decide to go back  I will just head straight to the bar instead. Maybe I will have better luck there.The food is good I think. Pizza's are off the hook and the pizookie!
Minhphuc T.,San Leandro  CA,591,14,199,9/24/2010,4.0,Cant go wrong with this place. The jambalaya is always good. Nice selection of beer and they always have different seasonal beers too! Service is kinda slow but expected since its always crowded here but the friendly service makes up for it! Fun place to go to with friends.
Jonny A.,Fremont  CA,213,286,252,8/15/2012,5.0,I've had issues with the BJ's in the south bay  but so far  this one has been flawless. Even when it first opened  the wait time wasn't too bad -- nowadays  there isn't a wait -- at least every time I've been since. The servers are really friendly and knowledgeable -- chatty in a good way too. There's plenty of delicious food and drink -- and the happy hour goes on late -- big plus. Hosts are always greeting people right away. Come on down!
Blck R.,Fremont  CA,13,124,360,8/15/2010,4.0,I've been to the one here in Fremont and to the one in Sac. Although I can't remember what I had  I do remember that it was good. This is one of those places that you can take a date to or just to meet a few friends for a great lunch or dinner. I do remember having the Pizzokies...AWESOME.Four Trans-Fats out of Five
Marissa L.,Albany  CA,0,21,3,7/6/2014,1.0,"I recently visited this location a few weeks ago. My service was horrible!! I don\'t know if the sever wasn\'t very experienced or if she had too many tables. My boyfriend and I got seated and it took a while before our server came and we ordered an appetizer and 2 ice waters. 20minutes went by... No water or appetizer. Our server finally brought out our appetizer but forgot to bring the water. We reminded her and it took another 10 minutes to get water and extra napkins. The food was just okay. Our silverware was dirty and I asked her for another set which took sooooo long. We had to ask for more water. Maybe I wouldn\'t have been so annoyed if she was actually friendly. I asked to speak to the manager. I seen the server talking to her before she came to my table. I told the manager how horrible my service was and how I had to ask for EVERYTHING. I was very respectful and calm and all she said was ""wow that\'s not normally like her"". I was in shock. No ""I apologize"" or anything like that. I found that very unprofessional. I will NOT be returning."
Sean M.,Newark  CA,21,317,40,9/19/2010,4.0,Service - 4 StarsGumbo - 4 stars but very spicyChicken Parmigiana - 4 StarsPizookie Trio - 5 Stars - totally awesome idea for a desert.
Tiara H.,Newark  CA,2,35,17,12/7/2008,4.0,They just build this recently so we decided to check this place out for my friend's birthday last week and we were very happy with what we found. =)The food was delicious! I had blackened chicken alfredo and a few bites of the giant chili cheese baked potato and they were both mouth-watering! They have something to eat for just about anyone  and their drinks arn't too bad either. =)I believe I had the Blue Moon drink and it was pretty good  not the best I've had but hey it was a purty color lol XD Our waiter was not very attentive but that doesn't mean all of them are like that.I would definately check this place out! It's pretty decently priced as well. =) Yumm...I want to go there now lol
Heidi M.,CA  CA,268,295,776,7/7/2010,5.0,This is fremont/ newparks hotspot  since there really isnt any form of nightlife locally  unless you want to go to a dive bar+1 great place for groups+1 pretty busy  but I always get seated pretty quick+1 hug portions for pizza and entrees+1 wide variety of drinks and mixed drinks+1 alot of TVs to watch games+1 oreo pizookie *drool* +1 service is always pretty great. A couple of my friends are servers here  so I'm a bit biased. Im glad they opened one nearby  since I would drive to SF or SJ to get my pizookie fix :)
Rachael W.,Folsom  CA,13,57,16,9/8/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,My daughter begged me to take her here a couple of weeks ago for a girl's lunch. Have to say the food was GREAT this time. I got the parm crusted chicken. O-M-G! Yuuuu-uuum! She got something or other she liked & I thought was OK. As usual the rootbeer was fabulous. Glad I went back. My MIL has been asking me to take her there  & now I can without worry.Still won't go for take-out ever again.PS- My 20's were still on my car when I came out. Maybe cuz a cop was parked in the lot watching traffic go by?
t h.,Santa Clara  CA,1,118,3,3/19/2011,5.0,5 stars for the chocolate chip pizookie. We ordered a large one and it was still warm when they brought it to the table and was topped with vanilla ice-cream. Add a candle on top and it's perfect for a birthday celebration if you forgot to get a cake.
Cris G.,Union City  CA,0,4,4,1/19/2013,2.0,The wait here to get a table is always long in addition to waiting for your food is another long process. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have plenty of time to kill.
Mindy H.,Stockton  CA,13,127,40,11/30/2011,1.0,I don't if it was an accident that I had a bitch of waitress bc all the other reviews seem to rave how good and attentive their waiter/tresses were but my god  this girl was a straight up bitch. It was just my boyfriend and I and all we ordered were 2 entrees and 1 drink and a dessert. My boyfriend ordered a chicken fried steak to substitute the mash potatoes with french fries and low and behold  when the food came out  we got mashed potatoes. Food just took forever to come out and the only thing satisfying was my pazookie. She never came by to ask how we were until we had to flag the bitch down to give us a refill. I am usually a very generous tipper  but this bitch didn't get shit.
Rheine T.,San Lorenzo  CA,501,136,138,11/8/2011,3.0,So I took my boyfriend and my friend here for their birthdays and it was fine. Everything was just fine. Food was wonderful and pizookies are worth the try. But the waitress keeps getting stuff wrong. She gave us the desserts when we didn't even order it yet and she insisted that we ordered it  but we didn't and then she gave us another menu for it  then we ordered the desert and then she gave us the check and left us alone. Hmm . She is kind of grumpy waitress.
Sandy N.,Fremont  CA,37,231,181,11/19/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"Well don\'t know what their deal was on this Wed night  but it wasn\'t good. Typically when I come here - all goes well  service and such...not this time... So its about 10 min to 7  I remembered to call in for call ahead seating  I know its not a reservation but you get placed on the waiting list. 10 min later we get there. I said my name and that I called in. Still the lady said it was going to be 15 min. I was thinking well wtf did I call in for? So there we stand my son and husband. 15 min passes  20 min...Then I see other parties being seated...ok. So I go and ask the lady (different one - other went on break or something) and I said I called it in and whats taking so long  she said ""Oh we had you as not in yet"". WTF? Then she said that I will be next on the list...then right after a party of 3 were seated (I assumed we were going to be next!) Then this is what really pisses me off  a party of 3 just walks in - she said she called in. Then about 5 min later her pager goes off and they are seated - by this time I was flamed! a min later ours goes off and I toss it onto the counter just extremely dissatisfied at this point. We were then seated  menus were passed out. Then the excruciating wait - had to be at least 20 min before the waitress came by. We ordered our drinks those came  we ordered the calamari - came out in about 10 min  though they were extremely greasy and somewhat soggy. But my son didn\'t care and ate them - or else Id have them replace them but at this point my son was starving. My son and I had waters to drink  hubby got OJ. So when my son needed a refill he did get one  but it just took way longer than usual. My husband was never offered a refill or at least a water on the side. I admit out entrees were good (I got the pizza  hubby got a steak and son got chicken tenders) Our waitress was virtually unavailable. Either they need to hire more staff (both on the floor and the kitchen) or they need to train the waitresses on better service. So we get our check and we had our coupon for $5 off  after she came back with the new receipt  she had knocked off $10 - I thought good. My hubby likes to give a good tip  he was knocking down like $9 or so. I said why? the service stunk & the wait stunk. So he puts down $5. So I suppose the next time we go here - we will go before the dinner rush  but we thought 7 was sorta late and that it wasn\'t going to be to crowded. I will still call in and I will make sure the person who checks us in knows that I did call in. So we don\'t have another issue."
Craig F.,Fremont  CA,315,211,431,9/17/2009,2.0,Came here for happy hour and sat at the bar. Bar was packed as expected and was able to find the last remaining spot at the end of the bar.I ordered a Piranha pale ale $3.75 (Beers $1 off during happy hour 3-7pm and 10pm till close) and the BJ's Favorite mini deep dish (combo pizza $5 - half off during happy hour reg $10)The pale ale was ok  I'll stick to Sierra Nevada. The pizza was good esp. for $5  I would not pay the $10 for the pizza when it's not happy hour. With 10 min to go of happy hour  I decided to try their Hefeweizen. I will def. not be having this one again. I'll stick to my Pyramid Hef or Blue Moon. Way too sweet. Didn't like this one at all.Final damage was $13.72 for 2 happy hour beers and a mini pizzaI'm doubtful that I'll come here very often in the future  but if I do  I'll skip the house brewed beers and recommend you do the same.
Jamie T.,Newark  CA,16,9,1,2/9/2015,1.0,"ZERO STARS!!!! Management is horrible particularly Desiree. Our server was slammed in the bar and appeared to be new. My kid\'s drinks came out after my husbands beer and my soda. I let that slide. While I was waiting or our meal I watched how Desiree the manager  talked with 3 servers just standing around. If it\'s not busy enough where you can all stand around talking then either help the girl struggling or go the F&$& home! While I\'m still observing the manager and her unprofessionalism. My husband and two children received their meals. The food pony then came back to tell me that they were just making the lettuce wraps. These were ordered of their happy hour menu and are not regular sized which is fine but a burger and two kids meals were done before. We were not once checked on by our server or offered refills. After out meals were done for 10 min. and still no one my husband told the hostesses we needed the manager so we could let her know of our unpleasant experience as well as the bill. In comes Desiree who we had to interrupt from her 20 min conversation. She picked up my husbands dish and without talking to is shouted to our poor overwhelmed server to get our bill. When out server walked over I told her to bring her manager back. When Desiree came back she said all you wanted was the bill right?! That\'s when my patience ran out! I told her had she picked up more than one dish from the table or not talked for the last 20 min and noticed me trying to get her attention that maybe she would know how unpleasant our dining experience was. I told her we never got a refill  my sons drinks came out last and my lettuce wraps were never made like the rest of the order. She the. Said  ""Fine do you want me to take off the lettuce wraps?"" At that point I told her she should do more which she didn\'t and how unprofessional she is for talking for the last 20 min about non business related items with employees while our server struggled. Normally I don\'t ask for discounts but at that point the bill should\'ve been mostly comped not the happy hour lettuce wraps which was the cheapest for her to take off. I AM SO IRRITATED! Next is corporate. She needs to be trained again....BJ\'s service is starting to turn into the quality you got at Red Robin before they closed!"
Jorge H.,San Lorenzo  CA,133,165,16,7/13/2010,5.0,Hands down  THE BEST Restaurant/Brewery in the East Bay. The food selection is AWESOME. (Although for some it can be pretty intense). The beer sampler is FANTASTIC! Most places will give you small shot glasses filled with beer  this place gives you seven 5oz glasses for under $10!!! The service is great  the variety of beer on tap is very generous and the takeout option is a plus! I need to come back here to buy a pint glass and eat more of their YUM food!
Ricardo R.,Newark  CA,224,134,53,8/20/2012,4.0,Usually try pasta. Opted for the salmon  best choice EVER!! Friendly and quick service.
Rita E.,Concord  CA,720,174,229,9/9/2009,3.0,I've been to this location twice. Last Tuesday  we were seated almost instantly & on Saturday  we had pretty good timing as people were leaving the bar and openned up just the right number of seats.Tuesday's picks:+ Balsamic Glazed Chicken: I'll swear by it everytime. It's a pretty well-rounded meal. I've been lucky to never get under/over-cooked chicken.+ Strawberry Confusion: Tasted great but I couldn't taste any of the alcohol. + Pizookie: If you've never had one  treat yourself to a couple moments of bliss. A giant cookie & ice cream are sure to bring a satisfied smile to your face everytime.Saturday's picks: After spending the day wine tasting in Livermore  all I wanted was soup.+ Broccoli & Cheddar in a sourdough bread bowl: The bread was yummy  but the soup was SO salty... I'm glad I had the bread to balance it out a little.+ Mango Mojito: Another overly sweet mixed drink... Couldn't taste the alcohol. Yummy nevertheless.All-in-all  it's your run-of-the-mill American Restaurant & Brewery. Great for groups  one-on-ones  or dining alone. I'm glad they're building a BJs in Concord... Newark is so far...
Neil K.,Fremont  CA,5,507,1,7/7/2010,4.0,Came here for lunch and really enjoyed it.Lot of space and tv's all around if you're into watching sporting events while you eat.  They brew their own alcohol on the spot and also cream and cherry soda if you want something lighter.The menu is huge with a good variety of choices. Kids menu is also pretty good.Ordered some pizza and thought it was good. Wanted to try some other things on the menu but will do that next time. I've heard it gets really busy for dinner but I enjoyed my lunch experience there.
V K.,Hayward  CA,6,299,30,12/31/2009,1.0,(sigh) I wanted so much to like this place because I enjoyed the one in San Mateo - but this one was disorganized from getting seated to ordering food.We put our name on the list and were told it may be 20-25 mins wait - it was reasonable  but kept an eye on the bar area  just in case something became available. It didn't help that there were folks that were planted there permanently  so the turn over was just nonexistent.Our time came  we were called to the front  our little pager was taken and we were told to stand by a sign. I got a little peeved that people who got there 20 minutes after us and were given someone else's pager snagged a wait person before they were called and were sat before us. We were overlooked for quite some time - it was just chaotic and we were there before the rest of the crowd.Ordering food was another challenge  people that were sat after us also got their order and food about 15-20 minutes before us.To be fair  the food and drinks were good  at least the taste was the same as the one in San Mateo.I won't be back here - it was just very disappointing.
Konnie H.,Newark  CA,65,68,63,8/5/2010,4.0,BJ's is a really good place for gatherings and family dinners. Pizza is supposedly their most famous dish  which I will admit is pretty darn good  especially the crust. Their sandwiches are pretty good too.However  it's just a bit too greasy for my taste. I wouldn't go there too often  maybe once in a while. But overall  our waitress was very nice and helpful. Although she did have a little too much opinion on what my friend decided to drink...
Rene L.,Richmond  CA,19,254,233,6/24/2012,2.0,"I dont know what all the hype was about. It was my first time coming to this place and probably my last. I had a beer and my girl had a mixed drank and we had some appetizers that didnt even fill us up. I wanted to order some more foods and dranks but the waitress never came around   so I was like ok im out!! Waitress ""check plz"" paid it and left. We were there for the happy hour but there was nothing happy about it plus I think beer was only $1 off oh well I least I can say I tried this place."
Maureen M.,San Leandro  CA,70,280,12,11/28/2009,3.0,This place is just great to throw back a couple of beers and watch a game on 1 of 9 flat screen TV's. esp the jeremiah red!The menu is good for those that like variety  but not good for the indecisive.the service was good.Food: their pizza is a little bland to me  give me a REAL deep dish pizza please.try the jumbalaya  pretty damn good  ALMOSt as good as the south.and the one and only PIZOOKIE!!! for all those dessert feen out there!
Mina H.,Los Angeles  CA,95,177,69,6/17/2012,2.0,"Ordered a pizza and they messed it up twice! It was a standard ""veggie"" pizza - asked to hold the olives. How hard can that be? Waitress was clueless! But the manager did come over to apologize  and offer a new pizza. This is a great restaurant but if they keep this up  they\'re going to go down quickly!"
Lora R.,Oakland  CA,166,117,79,5/20/2010,4.0,We've been going since our first beer tasting here: though we only liked a few  we REALLY like them. Their Hef is tasty and I really enjoy their laid back and welcome attitude whenever I go.I haven't actually sat in the full restaurant area: we just hang out in their bar section: service is always helpful and fast  though we typically have to ask for the check before it appears. We have never once waited for a table  and I prefer the tall tables so I can sit high and swing my legs  pretending I'm both tall and a little girl. Brownie points for them.Their menu is vegetarian  and certainly pescatarian friendly which is not the easiest to find at brew houses~ And the servers always know which stocks are used for their items  which is GREAT and keeps me from getting sick which I certainly appreciate.I haven't had anything I didn't thoroughly enjoy  and their soups are fabulous! Their clam chowder was fresh and not too thick with lots of clams. The tomato-basil is lovely! Salad options are wide since they make them fresh so asking to take the meat out is not a concern.I enjoy the games here because it's not so crwded or loud that you have to yell: but it's boisterous enough to keep interest and excitement going.Price range can jump easily if you're going for the microbrews or cocktails  but otherwise it's a good price for the quality and quantity. They have the sort of dishes that don't look as big as they are so getting full is always easy! And be sure to go during their happy hour: super-awesome pricing and getting drinks and appetizers becomes simple!
Zain K.,Louisville  KY,336,781,3,4/13/2010,3.0,I've now sat here for about five minutes trying to think of something interesting or useful to say about this place  but to no avail. It's true-to-formula suburban microbrewery restaurant  with a large selection of nondescript and slightly overpriced food  and about a half-dozen or so home brews  none of which were special. At 10p on a Monday night there was a line  so this is apparently what Fremonters (or Newarkers  or whatever) do on a Monday night. A safe bet if you're in the area and looking for something predictable to eat  but you're feeling venturesome you can do better.
Mary W.,Portland  OR,28,67,76,6/7/2010,4.0,Their BBQ chicken deep dish pizza had a super yummy crust - thick and fluffy and the bottom a little crunchy  not like a dense Chicago style deep dish. Got the big appetizer sampler: Avocado rolls and Santa Fe rolls were good. Artichoke dip with tortilla chips was not very exciting. There were also mozzarella sticks but didn't try them.Went on a busy Sunday night and had to wait 30-40 minutes for a table so it's understandable due to the number of people that service would be on the slower side.
Alyssa S.,Daly City  CA,77,162,66,7/7/2012,3.0,"Ive liked this location for a while but keep getting veryyyy mixed experiences. Example of time i liked:Bartender was great  very friendly  quick and even came up with a new tasty drink with me since ive been dieting and trying to keep low calories. Since i was gonna eat their food i figured drinks better be kinda light. Enjoyed happy hour and had some appetizers. Example of time i hated:Had a pretty large group about 12 people so wait was a while but front host was great and We finally got seated. We all ordered our food from mrs. grouchy hates her job waitress but when it started coming we were getting more appetizers than we ordered. We all knew what we ordered so we gave em back to her cuz they werent ours. She never came by our table but for our orders and when food arrived. No refills or ""anything else?"" or ""would anyone like dessert?"" i even walked to the bar to get a glass of water. Totally abandoned :( then when our bill came the appetizers that werent ours that we never ordered or ate we were still charged for. Lame...good thing i wasnt buzzed or anything because i would have just paid the bill. Anyways took foreverrrr and they finally removed it and we couldnt wait to get outta there."
H A.,Fremont  CA,2,31,,6/24/2014,2.0,I went to BJs some weeks ago with family. I ordered pork chops. When they arrived I thought I would have to break out the chain saw to cut through them. I politely complained to the waiter and he offered me the ribs instead to which I agreed. However  they were burnt. Now mind you  I am not really hard to please but the experience there along with the wait time and pricing really left me cold. This is not the first negative experience I have had with this chain. Management really needs to review their overall customer service and quality of food
Chi N.,Union City  CA,23,219,108,5/17/2010,4.0,I just had dinner here with my cousin. We didn't have to wait for a table at all...Our server was super nice  and helpful. We got the appetizer sampler (he kindly traded out the avocado rolls for the Santa Fe spring rolls  thanks!)  2 bowls of clam chowder  and the cajun chicken pasta. The chowder came out right away  and piping hot! MMMM. Next came out the sampler  it was HUGE  it came with mozzarella sticks  twice as many Santa Fe rolls and spinach dip with chips. Super good. Then our pasta came out  which we shared and barely touched  only because we were so damn full.Too full for a pazookie. BOO!!Otherwise a delicious meal  and great service!
Wil G.,Hayward  CA,98,308,95,5/15/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Went there for some pizza and brews with my brother. We called in to put our names in on the way  we got there and was seated at a table within a few minutes (off peak) the waiter was extremely polite! beyond the norm  which was great and the beer and pizza was great  never rushed us and had a few refills  I would come back again  compared to the one in Dublin.
Chris C.,Union City  CA,51,549,15,4/30/2009,4.0,"My friends decided to take me to BJs for a belated B-Day Dinner. BJs is a chain brewery that kind of reminds me of a what will happen if you mix Gordon Biersch with Cheesecake Factory  a decent brewery with massive amounts of high caloric food. The most important thing to know about this location is that the lines are RIDICULOUS LONG. So best to call in ahead of time and have them reserve you a spot like we did. Even with the call in  we still had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. People were waiting outside the door to get into this place. The interior here is nice (kind of in the style of Cheesecake Factory) with plenty of flat screen TVs all over the place. The best way to describe the menu is that it\'s American Bar Food so we\'re talking about deep dish pizza  burgers  sandwiches  big salads  etc. Prices here are reasonable. Most appetizers (sliders  nachos  wings) will cost you between $5 - $9  sandwiches and burgers $7 - $10  and entrees such as pizza  steaks  chicken  etc you\'re looking at the $10 - $17 range. Also they have a couple of vegetarian options such as a veggie burger  veggie pizza  and some pasta dishes. We looked over the menu and I decided to put in an order of their Blonde Beer and an open faced meatloaf sandwich  my wife got the salad and the baked potato  my friend got the chicken club  and his wife put in an order of mozzarella sticks and the chicken lettuce wraps. We chatted for a bit and our drink orders came up. The blonde was good. It had a light taste to  was really smooth which I liked  and didn\'t have an after bite at all. Then about 10 minutes later came the mozzarella sticks and the salad. Portion here are definitely on the generous side. I would guess we probably got about dozen or so mozzarella sticks and the ""side"" salad was pretty generous. Veggies in the salad tasted good and not like its been sitting around for a while and the mozzarella sticks tasted like they were fresh out of the fryer and had a good crunch while keeping a good ""gooey"" cheese taste inside. Next came our meals  and holy mountains of food Batman  I mean  they must think we are sumo wrestlers or something because they brought out a TON of FOOD. My open faced meatloaf sandwich must have weighed a couple of pounds because the sucker was stack. It had a nice garlic bread on the bottom  a 2 inch thick slice of meatloaf  and a mountain of mash potatoes with gravy and fried onion rings on top (oh yeah it also came with some steamed veggies to make it ""healthy""). My wife got a potato that was on steroids because it was the size of a Nerf Football  and my friend and his wife got equally as large portions. Eating the open faced sandwich  it was really good. It\'s been a while since I\'ve had meatloaf and the combination of flavors was just great. The meatloaf was moist and the mash potatoes had no lumps in it. I tasted my wife\'s steroid potato and that was pretty good. It was basically cheddar cheese with steamed veggies on top. We were disappointed that they didn\'t offer sour cream and chives with it because that would have taken the potato to the next level. My friends seem to enjoy their meal too. After only eating half our meal  I boxed it up and got my B-Day Pizookie. There\'s not enough good things to say about Pizookie  a nice warm chocolate chip cookie about 5 inches in diameter fresh out of the topped with vanilla ice cream. If anything  it\'s worth getting the Pizookie. It was a nice way to end probably a 2000 calorie meal. The service here was nice and friendly. As to ratings  kind of hard for me on this one. Yes I would come back  but would a wait longer than 20 minutes  probably not  and judging by the lines out the door people are waiting somewhere in the 45 minute range. But I can\'t blame a place for being popular. Overall a 3.5 star experience  but good enough to round up to 4 stars. If you can avoid the lines and looking for a massive amounts of American High Calorie Bar Foods while watching the game  BJs is you place to be."
Michael S.,Dublin  CA,1,63,2,8/13/2012,4.0,I would give the micro-brews 4 or 5 stars. Food is 3 - 4 stars. Busy place with a good menu. I have eaten here several times while staying nearby for a month. The best dish was by far the parmesan-crusted chicken. I had that one twice! Pizza is excellent  and so was the barbecue beef sandwich. Burgers are good too. But go here for some serious brews.
Alex R.,Union City  CA,193,29,3,8/22/2011,3.0,This place is always seems packed. I mean the food is good here but not amazing. The pizza here is not my type of pizza but if you love deep dish style then you will love it. The price here are a tad too much but great tasting food none the less.
Roen R.,Hayward  CA,44,120,25,9/29/2010,4.0,I like this place because of their popular chicken dish. Their avocado eggrolls are the best. Their pizza blows  Sorry but I don't understand how their famous for their pizza. There is always a huge wait for me and my girlfriend to get a table because this place is so pact at night  and the parking lot is not big enough for all the customers  especially on the weekends. Their Pizookie! OMG They are the best! After I gobble this down  I just want to lay down and sleep and accept the fact that I'm gonna get diabetes because of how sweet that dessert is.
Britney C.,San Francisco  CA,86,201,50,5/11/2009,3.0,Came here on Mother's Day (yesterday) with my fiance and his family for the first time.We started off with some appetizer sampler that consisted of the avocado egg rolls  Santa Fe spring rolls  mozzarella sticks and the spinach and artichoke dip. The avocado rolls which came with some sweet dipping sauce was pretty good as this was the first place that I have seen them offered. And I love avocado. Everything else was pretty typical and could be found at every other chain restaurant.For my entree  I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken which came with mashed potatoes and some kind of sauce. I got two huge pieces of chicken which I ended up taking one home. The sauce that was drizzled on it was pretty blah and probably would have tasted better with some kind of honey mustard or tangy sauce to compliment the saltiness of the parm. The mashed potatoes were also pretty bland and I didn't really touch it after a few bites. Service was not great but not bad. It was a busy night so I'll cut our waitress some slack. Since I'm pregnant  I couldn't try any of the beers. =( I know  what's the point in going to a brewery if you can't drink beer?!?! But I will be back when I'm un-pregnant to try some of their brews and that damn pazookie.
Jess C.,San Francisco  CA,280,429,22,7/12/2009,4.0,BJ's would be one of my favorite chains. I'm normally not a fan a pizza but I love eating theirs. I recently discovered there's one opening near me in the East Bay but in the meantime  I guess Newark would be my next closest option. A group of girlfriends and I came here on a Tuesday night. There was still a 20 minute wait! Onto the food. As a group  we ordered the thai lettuce wraps. There was definitely a nice kick to it. I went with a small buffalo wing pizza. It was spicy but very good. It consisted of little chunks of buffalo wings  celery  cheese  and buffalo wing sauce. A small was more than enough for two people or at least two different meals. We finished off with the oatmeal raisin pizookie. I'm not a huge dessert fan so I guess that's why I don't really understand the hype it. It was just pretty much a giant cookie. The service was pretty good; our waiter was very nice and friendly though a little slow/unattentive at times. Our total for four people with gratuity was about $80. Not bad. Count down begins until they open the one in East Bay!
Sean S.,Anaheim  CA,98,50,21,9/26/2010,4.0,I first learned of this place when they catered my company's lunch meeting.This place gets 4 stars because of the great food  friendly wait staff and great food... plus they have fresh-brewed beer! I especially like the Piranha Ale.I've been back 4 times so far & I really enjoy their super-sized salads. Also  you can't go wrong with their appetizer combo and deep-dish pizza. Also  they conveniently have online ordering & a special pick up entrance.They get only 4 stars because it's a bit pricey for pub food.
Leena S.,Union City  CA,0,7,,2/24/2013,2.0,"I went here with 6 other people one day and was first off disappointed that they only have a ramp to get down to the seating area (away from the bar) all the way at the back of the restaurant. I was on crutches and when I asked how I could get down was told at the front ""there are only two stairs to go down."" I should have complained right then because I was furious. I would prefer it if the staff was trained in having some manners. I was on crutches with a massive boot and the lady at the front tells me ""it is only two stairs..."" Are you kidding me? Obviously  the staff does not care to accommodate those with disabilities. Would go to elephant bar any day over the rude treatment I received here.On to the food  it was pretty good but there were delays in receiving it. I can understand that because we had a large party but we had to ask for things several times before we received them. I would go here maybe for the happy hour but nothing else."
DeQuan S.,Oakland  CA,34,24,2,5/8/2012,5.0,Food  service? THE BOMB. Been coming here for a couple years. Wait time is about the same anywhere else on a busy Friday/Saturday night but its well worth the wait! TV screens all around (you can peek at the game  lol). Reasonable price for ALOT of food. Great place if your hungry. Check it out!
Joyce P.,Newark  CA,30,83,5,9/21/2010,4.0,I'll give it four stars. I am not going to lie. I am not a big fan of chain  but BJs...I'll make an exception. Their pizza is awesome. It's almost as good Z-Pizza for me at least.Their beer is goodRoot beer and cream soda is yummy!Great place to hang out and socialize with appetizers and drinks. They have pretty late hours.Their staff is really nice. I think once we had mediocre service  but it can't be perfect everytime. Oh and that take out service they offer is pretty nifty too.
Milicent A.,Fremont  CA,171,126,6,7/18/2009,3.0,"So I\'ve been here a couple of times  and I have to say not bad. The area is huge  but it gets packed quick! So expect to wait on those days. Every time I\'m hear  I get pretty good service  but some of the waiters/waitresses I have need a Rockstar or some kind of caffeine overload! Other than that  they were polite and attentive. Just kinda....Sleepy like? Anyway  always had a decent meal here  but the food is way too heavy for me  and thats A LOT to say coming from meTo be honest  I\'m not a big fan of their pizza  which they are known for. I like their lunch specials  and I like how they have a section for people who want to ""watch"" their weight...theres about 6-7 entrees that are less than 600 calories each  and they dont sound to bad either.im addicted to their unlimited soup and salad lunch special for about $6.75? I love their cheese broccoli soup. Good for groups  but plan ahead on busy nights. Happy hour is ok. Their bar can be bigger!Btw  they need to stop waxing/buffing that floor of theirs/"
Adrienne P.,Fremont  CA,50,151,1,3/3/2009,1.0,"It\'s really a shame that their service is so lousy. Otherwise  it would be a nice  fun place to go to in my neighborhood.We tried the on-line ordering service and boy oh boy did they screw up! Why even bother having a ""special instructions"" button when the staff is just going to ignore it? Problem #1: We requested ""no mayonnaise"" on the bbq chicken sandwich. It came slathered in mayo.Problem #2: We requested bacon and cheddar cheese on the sourdough burger. It came without both.Problem #3: We had a $5 off coupon code which we entered into the on-line system. They did not honor it until my husband had to point it out as he was picking up the food.Problem #4: They said the food would be ready at 8:15 p.m. It wasn\'t ready until about 8:40 p.m....actually  we think it may have been ready and just sitting in the kitchen and it was just when one of the employees decided that it was convenient enough that they went to go get it. The reason for our hypothesis: the food was cold and the bread on the sandwiches was soggy when we finally got to eat it. It got cold during the drive home  you say? Nay. We live about 4 minutes away. There is no way that it would\'ve gotten that cold that fast.Problem #5: We wrote an email to the company to complain (we were going to complain immediately but it was already 9 p.m. and we were tired and hungry and we knew that with how busy they were that no one would help us out). Well  they have not responded. Had they responded  I might have written a nicer review. BJ\'s - you messed with the wrong Yelper."
R. E.,Fremont  CA,4,49,5,9/29/2013,2.0,Service ok- nice people But that's why they get two stars. Loud  had a pizza  pricy and not great  ordered a drink and was told they didn't have the liqueur needed when I said there is no liqueur in the drink the server firmly repeated himself which says to me the bartender was to lazy to try to make a drink a little different- this is the second time here won't be going back did I say it was LOUD?? Left with a headache -
Richard M.,East Bay  CA,35,13,2,6/18/2014,1.0,Seems like every time we come here  the service has gotten worse. It's very SLOW. I mean sluggishly slow. This was on a Tuesday night. There were 7 of us. The two appetizers we ordered were wrong and came out at different times. Then it took another 40 minutes before we were able to order our entrees after we complained about the service . 30 minutes later  some of the entrees came out and boy  some of the orders were incorrect and mine was nowhere to be found. The waitress totally forgot my order (Enlightened bison burger) I had to wait another 20 minutes. Finally  I got my order and the bison burger was totally dry. It supposed to be cook in medium rare not well done. After getting the bill  even that was all wrong. My brother-in law spoke with the on-duty manager and complained to him about the whole experience. Don't know what had happened between them because my wife and I left to get out of this place.
Whitney N.,Hayward  CA,21,45,4,6/24/2011,4.0,I have only lived in Fremont 3 months but I've been here about 10 times. My friends and I always like to just sit at the bar when we eat because the bartenders are so funny and nice and the drinks are GREAT! I like the fun noisy atmosphere with the restaurant feel. Perfect place to come to watch the games!
David T.,Livermore  CA,1,20,,4/22/2009,5.0,I must be hitting this place at the right time because every time I get great service & the food is outstanding. It also helps to make sure you're starving because they have huge portions. Anyway they've got real ice tea not the watered down like at Costco that never empties (for long.) I've sampled just the burgers here which have been cooked perfect every time. It's the only place where I've gone where they include a knife for a burger. You need it if you're not starving. The fries are fine filler.The decor is nice. Lots of TVs & pleasant employees. It's pricey compared to most places I go for lunch but it's well worth it.
Vance P.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,19,1,1/29/2013,2.0,This place is busy all the time. If you have a larger sized group then you better be prepared to wait awhile. After you get seated get ready to wait some more for a waiter to help you out and take your order. Now I don't mind waiting a bit for some good food but this I tell you is not good food. Its not bad but its not worth waiting for at all.
Ariel L.,Union City  CA,50,83,,1/29/2013,3.0,Booze and the pazzooki thats all you need to get. The wait staff is always awesome with a fun enviroment.
Jee C.,Oakland  CA,137,250,397,2/7/2012,3.0,I'm not a person who goes to sports bar to watch games... but I think this BJ's needs more TV for people who like to watch while dining.
Al M.,Fremont  CA,73,9,1,3/8/2011,4.0,My girlfriend and I came to BJ's for happy hour and decided to order out of the box  we order a Mediterranean deep dish pizza; this was new to us because we usually go for the usual combo or just pepperoni. When we got the pizza  it was hot  topped with veggies I couldn't even pronounce but it was hella good. It came on an iron skillet  waitresses were nice and conversational. All in all  loved it.
Maureen R.,San Jose  CA,11,11,,8/18/2012,5.0,Just had the most pleasant encounter with a woman I believe is the manager! Any restaurants wld be lucky to have such classy personnel. Please eat here  I know I will be back!
David J.,Fremont  CA,6,20,,9/22/2011,2.0,Long wait  waitress disappeared  no utensils  food was cold when they finally brought it  got my order wrong  there was no sugar on the table  so dark you couldn't read the menu  they don't offer any bread or chips before the meal  they had no coffee ready. However the tvs were big and they are numerous. Not sure about the beer. I wont be going back.
May C.,San Jose  CA,69,183,3,3/20/2009,5.0,Not sure if it was because it was St. Patrick's Day  but their happy hour ended til midnight!!!!That's Awesome Blossom!!! (Whoops  wrong restaurant)
Kristen O.,Springfield  IL,26,21,44,10/25/2011,3.0,Food as always is good. Bartender needs some work. Had to listen to her grumble about everyone else that works here while trying to enjoy my lunch. She also kept touching her hair and face then touching plates and glasses. Ick.
Niza H.,Fremont  CA,0,13,,12/1/2011,1.0,Never  never again will I go back to this place. The food is okay but the service is so horrible that I would rather stay home. My friends and I've been to a couple of different BJ's locations and the food and drinks are always good so when we moved to Fremont we decided to check out the closest one in Newark for my friend's birthday. Big mistake. We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. That was the only good part of the night. First  the waiter forgot to bring me my drink  twice. And his hand writing was so bad that the bar tenders had to come over to our table to ask what we ordered 'cause they couldn't read the ticket. So that took forever. Once we ordered food  it got worse. As starters  a couple of us got salads and one got an appetizers. The waiter brings out the pizza stands and the condiments  but no starters. Twenty mins later  a salad comes out. The other salad and appetizer doesn't come out until long after the first one is completely gone. It's been over an hour at this point  but we were a big party so we expect it to take a bit longer for us  but not like this. We wait. And wait. Finally our food comes out. It's cold  my burger is undercooked  but we eat anyways. Nobody's gotten a refill at this point  even though most of the glasses have been empty since before the first salad arrived. I have to stop one of the other waiters to ask for refills since our waiter doesn't bother to check up on us. The last straw for me was when the waiter didn't want to split up the check for us. He said it would take him too long to figure it out so he told us to just do it ourselves. So we split up the check  tax and gratuity as well (We were a party of 12 so it's automatically put in). He comes back with the receipts for us to sign  and we noticed that he's put an additional tip for himself on the receipts. So we send those back and wait. Finally the manager has to come over and sort everything out. The whole process took over half an hour. Needless to say  we were all pretty pissed off by the end. And we all vowed to never  ever  come back to this BJs.
Monica L.,Gilroy  CA,403,803,60,2/1/2009,4.0,"I feel like I have been to a BJ\'s before but I am just not sure where or when because they seem to be popping up everywere!Came here yesterday for lunch with my dear friend Sue Ann D.*waving* and her husband. Yeahhh! This place is huge! I walked in and I was thinking ""WOW! This place reminds me of Vegas for some reason"". The decor is trendy  modern and cool. I liked it! We were seated immediately and had great wait service. We shared the chicken wraps and all of us ordered the turkey club since both Sue Ann and her husband were raving about it. It is very good! I could only eat one out of the 4 sandwiches! I took the rest home to eat for lunch today. It also included a decent sized garden salad and I had that with Italian dressing. This place sort of reminds me of Cheesecake Factory (which I am not a fan of) but without the ridiculous wait! This location sits alone in a Mervyns shopping center plaza (sniff sniff!) with all bare stores and wood planks on the windows and doors. I am sure within the year this area will be really desirable with new and shiny stores. But BJ stands all alone pretty well. Their parking lot is a bit strange for some reason but there is plenty of parking because of Mervyns being unoccupied. I would come back probably with a group since it seems like a good location for large parties. Prices are decent and since I got to make two meals out of my one meal from here  it was worth it in my book! I\'ll be back!"
Leo L.,San Jose  CA,4,93,32,4/27/2012,4.0,Good Californian food and beer. Good service. Nice amenity. Like the place!
Reese S.,Tuscaloosa  AL,33,108,183,8/5/2011,4.0,This place deserves at least a 3.5 average rating. I mean  3 is just an average joint. BJ's brews their own beer and sodas. That's not average. That's brilliant.Upon mention of the home-brewed sodas  I decided to try out their Cream Soda. It was delightfully fizzy and sweet  but not too sweet. It had far better cream flavor than that store-bought stuff. I do not drink sodas  but this was good.I ordered the Smoked Turkey Cobb. Very tasty. Let me give you then run down: layers of smoked turkey adorned by lettuce  tomato  cheese  applewood bacon  avocado  and Dijon mayonnaise sit atop a toasted  garlic and cheese French roll. The roll was the best part of the sandwich  and the sole purpose for my ordering it. It was crispy and crunchy as any good toasted roll should be; the garlic and cheese sent me to another realm of Bread Heaven. I love me some bread  and this roll was packed with flavor. This is not just some run-of-the-mill plain jane sandwich bread. This stuff rocks. The bacon added a nice smokey flavor that paired well with the smoke of the turkey. The Dijon mayonnaise added flare and a creaminess to balance the crunch. As any sensible person should do when eating at BJ's  I ordered the Pizookie. Think of the warmest  gooiest  chunkiest cookie  then think of cold  creamy ice cream...that is the Pizookie. But what differentiates this dessert from the normal cookie and ice cream crap served everywhere else is its cooking method. The dough is placed in a thin metal dish  and baked like a small pizza. Then the ice cream is dolloped on top  melting constantly into a river of creamy delight.The options are many: chocolate chunk  peanut butter  oatmeal raisin walnut  and macadamia nut. All the best cookies. Vanilla bean ice cream is the only one offered for the normal Pizookie. I ordered the chocolate chunk (had to go with the classic). Phenomenal. The best thing of the night. It was so warm and so gooey with large chocolate chunks that just oozed and melded with the creamy ice cream. And vanilla bean was a great flavor selection on BJ's part. It has a distinct flavor  and pairs well with a fresh cookie. I felt like Santa  but on a planet where the cookies aren't stale after sitting there all night  but rather cookied while I was coming down the chimney; and instead of boring milk  I was given the best thing ever created: ice cream.The place is very loud  the service is not very good  and it is darker than Mordor (hence my lack of food pictures). Come for the Pizookie.
Eddie K.,Newark  CA,0,8,,9/7/2013,1.0,Came in for lunch and the wait for food is terrible. Took almost 1hr for them to bring out my pizza. Then when the pizza finally came  the pizza was not even cook with raw sausage and meat. Then the manager came by and said sorry and will take the pizza off the bill. Do she even expect me to pay for a uncooked pizza. Totally insane seevice.
Emmie L.,Milpitas  CA,161,200,8,12/17/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Second time coming here  and the experience was a tad bit less pleasurable. Since we came on a Friday around lunchtime  the weekend before Christmas  the place was jam packed and overflowing with Christmas gift exchanges it seemed. The main hostess was okay - I like that they gave us a buzzer to let us know when it was our turn to be seated. The wait wasn't all that bad; around 10-15 minutes at most. Our server was much cheerier! I wonder why haha. No  but he was a nice enough guy who seemed a bit distracted at times  but he was handling many tables all at once. Gave us completely fresh glasses of water  about 2 times for each of us. He gave us some recommendations when we were stuck between two very tantalizing choices  and we took his word for it  thankfully. We ordered from the lunch menu; very affordable choices with great value I'd say - about $6.25. Eventually  I went with the Margherita Fresca (?).. just completely butchered that haha  but hey  it was tres bon. It came with a small side of salad and 4 mini pieces of pizza  which I didn't take to go for what seems like the first time in ages because 1.) the wait was long! I mean like 45 minutes long for our main dishes to come out; no free appetizers either  which sucked a little 2.) the portions weren't those of immense proportions or anything of that sort The red velvet mini pizookie was too sweet for my liking.
Christy K.,Dublin  CA,8,71,,3/16/2009,4.0,Great selection of food. Their ale and their Hefeweizen are really good. The service is SLOW. Painfully slow. I know it's crowded  but it doesn't take 30 minutes to fry up some fish n chips  ok? I'd go back because so many things on the menu sounded tasty. And it's a cool place to hang.. the bar is nice  they even have Grey Goose L'Orange there  which made my dad happy. Our waiter was so-so. I've definitely had worse but he just really seemed like he didn't want to be there. All in all  cool place.. has potential.
Timan G.,San Francisco  CA,212,123,,1/25/2010,2.0,"This place reminds me of a blend between Cheesecake factory and your typical sports bar. There are more knife and fork options but the food really isn\'t all that great.The burgers were a let down  and my mom\'s cheeseburger actually came out a bit cold! My brother loved his calzone. The fries are just eh. I had the open-faced meatloaf sandwich which supposedly features BJs\' ""amazing signature meatloaf."" Did I miss something? A college student with no cooking experience could make better meatloaf.But the calamari was good (granted it\'s really hard to mess that stuff up.) The mozerella sticks were delicious with a very tasty  parmesan garlic marinara sauce. I\'d go back for the cheese sticks  that\'s all."
Keno M.,San Leandro  CA,51,26,37,5/21/2012,5.0,Good food had the ribs got a half rack ate half of it lol calamari appetizer great three people with drinks and desert $100 WELL definitely go back the help was hella' cool and on point love it!!
Will C.,Queens  NY,2260,590,453,1/22/2009,1.0,The staff is poorly trained. After dropping a pizza dish into one of the kids meal  anyone with common sense would offer to replace the dish right away. This review is based on service.
Nicole D.,Oakland  CA,6,371,87,1/17/2012,4.0,When we went on a weeknight is was crowded with people celebrating the holidays. It's worth coming for happy hour and half off of their smaller size pizzas. It allowed us to try a variety and have money and stomach space for their pizzookie - yum!
Tisha G.,London  United Kingdom,673,443,247,6/19/2009,3.0,"After all I had heard about BJ\'s  I was really excited about coming here!Then I met their jerk-off bartender  Robert. GAG me. Completely rude! It was my friend Sasha\'s 22nd Birthday  so we first-things-first; We marched up to the bar to buy her a few drinks. It did\'t take the 7 of us long to realize that our bartender that had been tending to the same group before I had gotten there  was completely oblivious to our business. He was rude  he ignored us  wasn\'t very good at taking our orders  and even TIPPED himself from my change!I didn\'t even get my $5 change back for my drinks. Because he took the change for himself  I ended up being forced to tip him more than my drink cost. Now I\'m not a miser - If you do really well and are friendly  I will tip you $10 for your effort to please me as a customer  because face it  places need patrons in order to do well. Too bad they stiffed one who is an avid yelper.Food took a while to come through  but our waitress (tall skinny caucasian girl) was very sweet  accomodating and helpful. LOVED HER! We were in a goup of over 20  and she was very calm about how crazy it was.But the bartender! No matter how many times we went back (And we spent at least $200 at the bar) this ""Robert"" character was incredibly rude. He even almost gave me a DIRTY glass. Are you freaking kidding me? Luckily a smarter  kinder bartender behind him pointed out that fact quickly and then took over the task of making my drink. Good guy  but I didn\'t catch his name.Overall  BJ\'s was so overrated. But their Grilled Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps were really good."
Donald R.,Anaheim  CA,465,252,97,1/11/2012,5.0,Deep Dish Pizza and happy hour is great. Reminds me of Uno's Pizza from back in the day. I also love the great selection of beers they brew.
Rana A.,San Francisco  CA,89,400,175,3/8/2009,1.0,"It\'s nice to see that Fremont has a restaurant that is open past 10pm. The food here is ok  but the service is really bad!We had a party of 13 and they told us it\'d be an hour and a half. Knowing this was a lie we stuck around the bar until our table was ready. About 25-30 minutes later we see a table being cleared off. I walk over to the hostess stand to ask if we can/were going to sit there. I was mid way through my sentence and she walks away....No excuse me  just walks away. At first I thought ""what just happened? then I was PISSED! I talked to the other hostess about what just happened and she told me to ignore her ""because she\'s weird"". I don\'t give a F**K if you\'re weird!!!This is your JOB!! Anyhow I go to complain to the most senior manager and all he says is ""I\'m sorry"". I apprecaite the apology  but he didn\'t even try to make me happy. He didn\'t offer to discuss the matter with the hostess  offer a complimentary dessert or possibly a voucher for the next visit. Just I\'m sorry. Luckily our server was kind and gracious. She was very efficient with us and checked up on us frequently. We all left happy and full  but that hostess\' behavior left a bad taste in my mouth that I don\'t plan to return."
Florence W.,Fremont  CA,122,281,27,3/28/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Same great service as always  but I tried two dishes that I'd like to write about. Last week I tried the balsamic glazed chicken ($10.95) and I wouldn't recommend that to others  unless you like your chicken well done. I found the portion to be a bit smaller than the other dishes  but it would fulfill an average appetite like mine. It is a bit on the healthier side with lean grilled chicken under a bed of greens. The only thing a little unhealthy (meaning DELISH!) in this dish is the white cheddar mash. Today I tried the parmesan crusted chicken ($11.95) because two different people told me I had to try it. The two large chicken breasts were pan-fried to perfection with this lemon butter sauce which I ordered on the side. I had steamed broccoli and white cheddar mash on the side. This was awesome and could only finish one chicken breast and the broccoli--huge portions! The sauce was worth the 12 bucks alone--but be warned  it IS a butter based sauce  so try no to go overboard! Both times I came here I had to really control my appetite because I am head over heels in love with their cajun chicken pasta--it sucks to be on a low-carb diet! Once again  it is IMPERATIVE that you request a table in Joanna's  Arthur's  or Jackie's section. These three are the best servers BJ's could ever hope for--kind  funny  not too chatty  quick  and overall awesome! Final Verdict: My low carb diet has limited my choice of food  denying my tummy of carbs puts me in a bad mood. Cue BJ's Brewery  because they can't do any wrong  they're vast selection makes me want to break out in song!
Scott B.,San Leandro  CA,104,89,32,9/12/2011,3.0,The service was a little confusing! I tried to call ahead and make a reservation but there were no more open slots... So the manager instead puts me down for a call ahead waiting  a deal they got... However when we arrive for my gfz birthday they didn't save my name so we had to wait for 40 mins to sit down and get a table... Which was very frustrating.. BUT They ended up waiving for a free appetizer and three free clam chowder bowls because they screwed up all on them! The service for the actual food was amazing when FINALLY We sat down!! Oh ya one last thing puzoookies amazing :)
Jen V.,San Pedro  CA,98,51,18,1/23/2012,3.0,I've been here twice and have enjoyed it every time. The food is great - especially the appetizers and pizza. The only problem is that it usually has a really long wait. I recommend calling ahead or just expect a 20-40 minute wait on weekends.
Beef E.,Portland  OR,27,79,33,11/6/2009,3.0,Just an average place to eat. I went there twice  once because I was really hungry and it was the only place still open. The food is uninspiring and their beers are hit or miss.  Although they have nice selection of Belgian Beer  I would rather make a trip to BevMo.Only go here if you are tired of eating Afgan or Indian food.
Monique R.,Palo Alto  CA,60,8,,3/30/2012,5.0,MMMMMMM  I love Bj's! I went here today with my friend  we had great customer service  and the food was great. We ordered and shared a small half and half pizza  which was really good and a Regular chocolate chip pizookie. We went at 5pm on a Friday  and surprisingly  we were seated right away! I love Bj's I will definitely come back to this location.
Cecilia D.,Hayward  CA,0,17,,7/18/2012,3.0,"Food is good of course. But for some reason  the hostess annoyed me. She looked at us when we walked in with this face like we were supposed to greet her first  I guess? We said for 2  and she said ""okay here"" and handed us the beeper and didnt say anything else. No ""Welcome to BJ\'s!""  no ""hi  how can I help you tonight!"" It turned me off. Pizookie was amazing as always though!"
Noel M.,Milpitas  CA,730,1653,634,2/20/2009,3.0,It must be BJ's week (my bf will be happy! lol!) For the second time this week I met up with friends but this was the first time at this location. It's the same ol' BJ's  terrible service and all. The only difference is this one has a jacked up parking lot.
Patel P.,Fremont  CA,0,2,,7/27/2011,1.0,"We had a horrible experience at this particular BJs.We waited over 2 hours for a table despite calling in a reservation (atleast that\'s what we thought we had) . We had really hungry kids and they wouldn\'t offer anything for us  not even the opportunity to order some snacks while we waited. In the end they said it would take 30 more mins so we just left! If you make a reservation make sure they write it down as a reservation and not a ""call ahead"". They have 3-4 people standing at the maitreD desk with not alot for them to do  but tables are open and not enough wait staff. For the record I really like BJs in general  good food   good atmosphere  great place to watch games.etc. and I have been to several other BJs without an issue  but this particular location is really poorly managed. Stay away "
Justin K.,Atlanta  GA,4,14,,8/3/2009,5.0,this location of 'BJs' in Newark  CA is a class act. While       mistakenly walking in the ladies room (i thought it was the mens room) I saw an employee do a line of what appeared to be cocaine. But besides that  I will comment they have some of the best beer and wings in Newark!
Gene E.,Newark  CA,1,29,,5/19/2012,5.0,I went to BJs a couple of times with friends and family. Nice atmosphere  good food  reasonable prices. BJs is not fine dining. It has more of a feeling of a sports bar. I will definitely be returning.
Gabriel R.,Mountain View  CA,31,16,6,5/19/2012,5.0,We showed up late and had great appetizers and burgers. Beer tasting flight was amazing and well worth it. Servers were helpful and fun. I will be back!!!
Foodierock n.,Fremont  CA,20,80,6,5/15/2009,1.0,I had been to the BJs in San Mateo and had loved it. The one in Newark is not that good. We waited for more than 1 hr to be seated even though we put our name on the list by calling them. We were in good mood so I didn't mind it. The place was overly crowded and the waiters have it out of control all the time. Once we got seated our food arrived in 30 minutes. The potato fries were not crispy ( that's the only thing you expect from fries really) The pizza was OK and not hot and so was the pasta. The Pizzokie was also mediocre. Moreover the waiter just kept avoiding us when we wanted to order. He was more interested in the new parties that were coming in. The total hours we spent at the restaurant - 4 hrs. Was it worth it? NO.
Agnes G.,Hayward  CA,0,11,,5/13/2014,1.0,I was a fan of this place when it first opened a few years ago  however throughout the years their quality has deteriorated. I ordered a veggie pizza and was eating it with a fork and knife  fortunately enough  as a was cutting a piece off  a piece of sausage popped out of the crust. The manager did not charge me for this however it did make me weary of the place. My other experiences were not great as well with my food being cold. I have given up on this place.
Olivia N.,San Ramon  CA,1,2,6,7/13/2010,5.0,We came here for our friend's birthday dinner on July 4. It was an early dinner and it wasn't very busy. We had a huge table by the window to accommodate 20 of us including kids. Our party started with a flight of BJ beers (7 beer sampler)  appetizer combos  shrimp lettuce wraps and a couple deep dish pizzas. All of them were delicious! For entre  I had Harvest Hefeweizen paired with Santa Fe salad. I enjoyed it very much. The servers were attentive and friendly. They did a great job keeping our drinks full and orders straight! The manager even came over and asked if everything was ok. All and all we had a great time here. Thanks to the free birthday pizookie with a candle. We were able to sing Happy Birthday to our friend! I would recommend this place to everyone.
Ha N.,San Francisco  CA,261,131,63,12/6/2010,3.0,The only thing I come here for: one word. PIZOOKIE! 887 calories. Enough said  I FAIL
Omid M.,Fremont  CA,62,78,1,1/30/2010,2.0,The food is okay. Ghetto type of a crowed hangs out here. Its like a bar with okay food. I know they have had problems with cars being broken into and fights in the parking lot. The only thing that is great here is the PIZOOKIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is the only reason I will go back.
Helen H.,San Jose  CA,23,16,36,11/11/2008,1.0,"I work not a mile away from BJ\'s and very excited that it\'s finally opened.  Opening night  I got there early with a coworker  5:00 pm and the place was crowded already. We found a table next the bar and the waiter took his time to greet us. He went over the beer menu  which was nice  and took our drink order. He did not come back for a little more while before he took our order (I expected it)  so problem.  After he took our foods order  he did not come back to check on us. We waited for over 45 for our appetizers and finally we had to track another waiter to get our waiter. When he came  he said  ""hmm  foods are not here yet "" and he left to check to on it. As it turned out  he never put the order in! The manager came  apologized that his staff dropped the ball on us  jokingly  and offered us desert; well  hello  we have not had anything to eat yet! We decided to leave and asked to have our bill  for a beer and an ice tea. At this pointed  we both expected the manager to comp our drinks  but NO  and they took forever to come back with our bill. We walked out of BJ\'s with shattering disappointments! I\'ve been driving by the restaurant every day with anticipation for its opening day and now walking away with regrets!  Do NOT come by until this place open for a year when they get their act together! Very disappointing. Horrible."
Miss H.,San Francisco  CA,262,324,262,12/12/2008,3.0,"Recently opened -- how exciting! But besides that  it\'s your standard BJ\'s.We went at a random in between lunch & dinner time  so we were quick to be seated and our food came out fast. Our server started off by telling us that we were sitting in a ""bad luck"" booth since the kitchen already messed up that booth\'s order twice -- good to know? Luckily we had no problem with ours  but I could imagine the service to be a little sketchy during busy hours since they\'ve just opened."
Alex R.,Phoenix  AZ,52,70,1,2/8/2009,4.0,An unfortunate name for such a good place.My friend suggested we go to this place because its his favorite place. I had not heard of it before so I figured it was worth a try. I walked into this place and was impressed. The high ceilings and open layout of the restaurant were really nice. I was even more impressed when my friend had told me that they brewed their own beers. Sadly this trip I didn't try any but I will next time for sure.I decided I was in the mood for chili. My friend wanted appetizers and said I had to try the pizza. Knowing full well I was going to Yelp this place I decided to go with it all and just sample what I could. The chili was delicious. It was perfectly cooked with a little bit of spice. The top was covered in a layer of melted cheese with a dollop of sour cream in the middle and some chives. Perfect toppings for chili.We got the appetizers sampler thing with spinach and artichoke dip  avocado egg rolls  santa fe spring rolls  mozzarella sticks. The appetizers really weren't that impressive. I ate all my mozzarella sticks but left most of the rest on the plate. It's not that big of a deal to me because I rarely order appetizers unless its nachos. On to the pizza. At first I almost waived off the pizza entirely. I mean it said it was deep dish pizza and I figured it couldn't compare to Zachary's or Patxi. Plus the pictures did not look like the deep dish pizza I had had before. When the pizza was delivered I shoveled out a slice grabbed my knife and fork and dove in. I was impressed their pizza was a much doughier version of my previous experiences with deep dish. It has a big puffy crust with very little sauce and then is loaded with cheese and toppings. After the first bite I was a fan. I sat there trying to convince my stomach I wasn't full and could finish my slice and have another. It was an uphill battle but I managed. During the course of our meal my friend said that this was his favorite restaurant and wanted to come here for his birthday I told him he totally should and do it on a night i don't have class so I can go. He agreed. So hopefully some time next week I will be able to go back and try a burger and get a sampling of their beers.
Jennifer D.,Hayward  CA,27,67,21,11/2/2011,5.0,I love their pizookies!!! Chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream...I cannot go without eating this!! I dream about them! Their service is really good and they let you try as many beers as you would like. They have a great selection of beer too!
Jojo N.,Pleasanton  CA,736,430,188,7/2/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Okay  so my last review was harsh  but very true. I came here last night with my gf  (the same friend that went with me back in January) We were very impressed with our server Mark. We sat at the bar and was prompted a table right away. Mark was very attentive and friendly. We ordered the Avocado Eggroll without cilantro and split the Giant Baked Potato which satisfied us. They even got our avocado eggroll right--WITHOUT cilantro! Then we got the Pizookie White Chocolate Macadamia which was divine! When I asked for a to go box  Mark made sure he gave me an extra side of Alfredo sauce for my leftover. We really really liked Mark a lot. Definitely will come back here againPS! They have 2 Happy hour deals! Great deals on appetizers and beer!
GG U.,Walnut Creek  CA,10,17,1,6/18/2012,2.0,My second visit here since it opened. First visit was about 2 years ago and after going back this I remember why I didn't make it a place on my list of favorites. Very long wait for the food. People that came in after us were served their food before we were. Portions are small for the price. Same as the first visit. Food is okay. I had the fish tacos and I have had much better at a fast food place.
Alicia L.,East Bay  CA,152,83,115,2/1/2009,5.0,I absolutely Love BJ's restaurant. This is probably my favorite restaurant; not because of the service (because their service really isn't the best since they are always so busy)  but because of the food. Their food is Awesome.If you ever go to BJ's you MUST have the Pizza. Their pizza is the best damn pizza I've ever had next to California Pizza kitchen. Also try a Pizookie (A cookie with ice cream on top of it) because that is super delicious too. They've got happy hour  a really big screen for all you sport fans  and ultimately the food is just great. However  not a great fan of the service  but it's not too bad. I just go for the pizza and pasta mostly.
tracey l.,San Jose  CA,114,106,29,10/27/2011,3.0,This place is solid to come here for lunch. The deals are good. I usually get the half sandwhich with half soup/salad and you get fries with it. Its a lot of food for 7 bucks plus tax and tip. When BJ's first opened up  the service was really crappy  but it has gotten way better. Their pizookie is the BEST. If its your bday you get a free one! :D Their pizzas are mainly deep dish and you can share making the price pretty good. Overall solid place  not my favorite bar  but definitely good to go during lunch. If you are on a diet though  don't bother to come as its high calorie dishes!
C M.,Fremont  CA,0,12,14,6/11/2012,4.0,I honestly don't get the crazy over the pizookie but nonetheless the staff has been friendly and service is good. Everytime we order their pizzas or other entrees such as the cajun chicken pasta  we haven't seen any faults in it. The best part about the restaurant is their late night hours on the weekends!
James N.,Union City  CA,787,387,1096,9/11/2009,3.0,BJ's are famous for their Chicago style pizzas. So what did we came here for? Of course the pizza. My sister was raving about this place so I wanted to come to see for myself. I'm quite amazed at the size of the restaurant everything is so huge. Even at one size of the restaurant my friend spotted some. We had ordered avocado egg rolls which came in with the sauce. I quite like the appetizer since it had us get ready for our pizza. We had ordered a half BJ's Cheeseburger Pizza and a Mediterranean Pizza. The Cheeseburger pizza is surprisingly good. Mediterranean Pizza however is a bit too strong for me the pesto sauce and blue cheese is overwhelming. Service was a little inconsistent since we had a waitress who was still under training. However  the waitress definitely is working and not slackin or anything.Food can be better but is rock solid. 3 Solid Stars.
J N.,Fremont  CA,0,77,13,4/12/2012,5.0,I went here for the first time last night. This is a real nice place to eat and have a beer. Atmosphere is very contemporary and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the Deluxe burger and it was really good. I also tried the Piranha Pale Ale which was really smooth for a pale ale. I liked it. The only complaint I have is that the waiter we started out with thought he was cool so he didn't write down our order and to no surprise screwed it up. My wife asked for no onions and she got onions. And I asked for a glass of water and he never brought it.
Annie M.,San Jose  CA,7,22,11,2/3/2009,1.0,"ABSOLUTELY the worst service!! We drove from Tracy to take my mom out for her Birthday Dinner. We decided to go to the new resto across Newpark Mall only to experience the worst service we\'ve ever experienced in restaurants!! When the hostess sat us down she offered us the beer menu and I said no but can I have a coke  she replied ""I would get you a coke but I\'m not your server"" and left. She didn\'t even reply by telling me she would let my server know. She was pretty rude!!The place wasn\'t so busy since it was a Monday night. When our server finally showed up  we placed our orders and when our meal was served  no ketchup  A1 Sauce or hot sauce was delivered. Just the plain salt and pepper on the table when we arrived. When I asked for the A1 sauce  she gave me a dirty look and walked away. Instead of us enjoying my mom\'s birthday  our conversation was just about how poor the service is and how our server was rude and her facial reaction was unacceptable. Aside from my brother in law joking about how the hostess made me feel stupid about not being our server  our waitress being rude didnt make the birthday celebration a celebration. After we finished dinner  I asked her about birthday celebrations. She said rudely that they don\'t do the singing thingy  which was fine with us but she didn\'t have to respond so rudely. She described the birthday cake and asked if we wanted the dessert menu. She gave me the dessert menu and took forever to come back. She was fast on delivering the bill though. When she finally came around about the dessert  we lost our appetite! Paid in cash because it took her forever to get the bill and we decided to pay in cash instead of Credit Card. She\'s lucky we gave her a tip. WIth that service  I will NEVER come back to this resto. I\'d rather wait 3 hrs for a table at Claim Jumpers since their payback is excellent service!venue: The resto is nicely decorated! lots of space and not crowded. Seems like they\'ve put so much effort into the decor of the resto and absolutely NO TIME on training their servers! Only props was to the bus boy who didn\'t complain and had a smile on his face. We asked for a plastic bag for the to-go box the waitress forgot to bring us and he got it right away. When we asked for a refill  he didn\'t reply by saying he\'s not our server. He got us another refill with no sarcastic look on his face.I don\'t recommend this place! THEY NEED TO WORK on their SERVICE. I\'d hate to name names but our server was REALLY aweful and she ruined my mom\'s birthday celebration with her rude service! The receipt said our server is Chantell B.OMG! I just tried calling the resto to speak to the manager (to complain about how the server RUINED my mom\'s birthday Dinner) and when I first called  it rang 3 times then someone hung up and the second time I called someone named Erica answered and I asked for the manager. She was really polite on the phone but I was on hold for more than 10 minutes. 5 minutes too long I\'d say! I forgot who I was calling for being on hold for so long."
Ben Y.,Fremont  CA,0,5,,8/3/2012,3.0,Their beer is better than the food. It's not bad  just average. I do like their fish tacos.
g s.,San Jose  CA,8,141,3,4/5/2012,4.0,Great place for happy hour! Wonderful selection of beers and cocktails.The appetizers are discounted $2 and drinks are off $1.The pizza was awesome and the crust was light and fluffy. The fried artichokes were great. Large restaurant with a nice sports bar area. Back dining area can hold large parties up to 100.
Evan T.,Newark  CA,10,34,4,12/21/2008,1.0,"So i went here to celebrate a birthday and well... we didnt\' reserve in advance but 1.5 hours wait for a BJ\'s? It\'s not like this place is a high class restaurant or anything. i\'ve been to the bj\'s in cupertino and that place gets a thumb up from me since its got decent service and the food is aight.So this newark location... well I dunno what it is. Perhaps it speaks to the quality of people in Newark/Fremont area  but the service here is absolutely awful. I\'m a simple guy  and when I don\'t know what to order  I usually order what the place is known for. So since its a brewery  a beer and possibly a burger or pizza. I decided to go with the calzone  and i asked the waiter what he\'d recommend in terms of beers to compliment what I ordered. He recommended a beer that he liked  but when i read the description it wasn\'t something recommended for a pizza-type dish. I was whatever about it.So i had a party of 4  and everyone got their food in a relatively reasonable time... everyone \'cept me. The person that brought the food to our table wasn\'t even our server and I asked ""what about my food?"" and of course he didn\'t know what i ordered and he said he would go check on it. Never came back.Halfway through my party\'s meal  I said...alright 10 more minutes and if nothing happens  I\'m taking off and the bill\'s on them.7 minutes rolls by and our server comes by and i\'m like...uhh i got nothing from what i ordered. He said.. umm  what did you order? I told him and he walked off to \'check on it\' and he said... its still cooking. i\'m like right  probably just started. Finally he came back with my calzone 5-6 minutes later and i was like  ""umm and my beer?""It was already too late. My meal was messed up. I should have at least gotten my beer at the beginning  and now i have to rip through it with my meal  instead of enjoy my meal in peace.When the bill came  i told him  \'i\'d like to at least be comped for my beer"" and the server already knew it was coming and took the bill away even before it hit the table. This place has got a lot of work. The area is a deadzone anyway  with failing rasputin and closing mervyn\'s. I would expect the servers to know their customer\'s order  and know how to at least check on their customers. This guy did not and i found myself flagging out other people\'s servers to check up on whats goin on. This place pales in comparison to other chains and is not worth the hype by far."
Noky C.,Fremont  CA,47,81,1,11/13/2008,3.0,BJ's is all about compromise.I came here around 5pm on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy. Took a seat at the bar and ordered a 4 beer sampler ($5.75); all of which were quite disappointing.Pumpkin Ale- watery and bland with a faint aftertaste of canned pumpkinNutty Brunette- tastes like a slightly skunked New CastlePM Porter- watered down Guinness with no carbonation; literally like half Guinness  half waterTanaka Stout- undrinkable; I'd imagine this is what shoe polish would taste likeWhile I tried to consume these barely drinkable beers  I ordered Angus Sliders since it was still happy hour and appetizers are $2 off (half off mini pizzas and $1 off pints). The sliders were excellent; like miniature In-N-Out burgers (I'm a sucker for all things in miniature).I upgraded my 4 beer sampler to a 7 beer sampler ($9.50) so I can finish off my mini burgers. The results were the same; disappointing beer.Brewhouse Blonde- imagine Bud Light with a faint nutty aftertasteJeremiah Red- New Castle with a kick (7.3% alcohol)Harvest Hefe- imagine watery  over-carbonated Widmer's hefeI recommend sitting at the bar. Big screen tv to keep you occupied  quick service  free samples  and best of all  no pushy waitress rushing you through your beer / food.Their in-house beers were disappointing  but they carry a vast amount of other beers (draft and bottled craft brews). All of which are reasonably priced from $4-$6 a pint. Combined with a large selection of food and big screen tv  this place is a great hang out. To sum up this long drawn-out review  keep it simple. Sit at the bar  order a pint of Guinness (or other outsourced brews) and some appetizers. For heartier food  stick with burgers and pizzas. Great place to hang out since they have a large selection of food and beverages; hence the 3 stars. It's a compromise. -----More on food:-deep dish pizzas are far too doughy. Thick mushy-soggy bread with toppings; some liked it  I didn't. Go with the thin crust pizza's from the appetizer section.-giant baked potatoes are just that; HUGE!! Looks tasty and filling with all the toppings  but I'd be in a carb-induced coma if I finished one. -spinach dip appetizer was disappointing; think grocery store jar of spinach dip and a pile of stale tortilla chips.
Glenn Q.,Fremont  CA,0,30,,7/26/2012,4.0,"Great beer  great food  quick  interesting staff. Went there for a birthday celebration  and will end up going back often. Defintely try the Jeremiah Red if you like a great ale with less hoppy bitter than an IPA. But I cannot suggest one food item  because everything has been top of the scale  so don\'t worry. It was great for a one-on-one in the bar recently  and great with four of us (including a baby) on the 4th of July. Highly recommend  and folks I went with said ""This is a new favorite""."
Henry C.,Fremont  CA,98,116,8,11/16/2011,4.0,I've been to BJ's about 6 times  I've had no issues with the food at BJ's for the most part. The food I've had there: about 4-5 different kinds of pizza there (all good)  I had the meatloaf (decent)  Pulled Pork bbq sandwich (really good)  Salads are (okay/avg.)  a lot of beer to choose from. the only thing I could say negative about BJ's is the service  its hit or miss at times.
Jennifer J.,Fremont  CA,127,59,2,11/26/2008,4.0,I love all the BJ's and I'm UBER excited there's one close to home. Maybe the reason I've had nothing but success in all my experiences at any BJ's is because I always sit at the bar. I just hang out and watch TV until there's a table available for me to snag. I love their beer - probably because it's so sweet. They have a little known option of 'mixing' the beers.. my favorite is the PM Porter with the Berry Burst Cider. They float the porter on top of the cider so the glass looks so pretty!!! Their food is pretty good. Really good pizzas and burgers  fair appetizers - overall just good straight up bar food. Of course  there are the pazookie's  which are the reason I fell in love with BJ's to begin with. Warm gooey cookie topped with melty ice cream... how could you go wrong?!?If you want to have some drinks and watch a game (or 10)  BJ's is the place to go.
Mike C.,Hayward  CA,0,17,,5/18/2011,1.0,THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Service is awful and the food is mediocre at best. I have been here for lunch and dinner because it is close to work. Every dish tastes the same .........bland. The pizza is poor compared to other pizza places in the area. The best thing I have tasted at the restaurant is their root beer. Otherwise try Hooter's or Jack's in Fremont as a sports bar.
Sandy C.,Fremont  CA,307,54,7,11/24/2008,4.0,"My hubby  brother and I came here for the first time last Friday to celebrate my brother passing the CA bar!! WOOHOOO!!! We had such an awesome time scarfing down pizza and beer and appetizers.... We got two mini pizzas so we could try different types  potato crisps  and a few rounds of beer samplers... wooo! ...Awesome combo for ultimate guilty pleasure satisfaction. =)The BJ\'s haters need to relax!!!! This place just opened and it\'s jam packed for good reason! Whiners say... ""eww greasy deep dish pizza"" well you know what I say? YUUUUUM!!! I\'m all about the deep dish pizza! I love how it\'s thick but has a nice crunch to it. It\'s not all that greasy but just enough! If you want healthy food -- go to sweet tomatoes dummies!!!Not only is the pizza awesome  I LOVE the beer samplers. It\'s way better than the ones they serve at Rock bottom. At Rock Bottom  you get these tiny little shot glasses. At BJ\'s the beer sampler glasses are much taller. YAY. This place sure beats happy hour at hooters with their nasty salty wings. A nice buzz after workthe best guilty pleasure pizza in town5 min drive from homeMy only complaint is the long wait to get a table. It\'s a 2 hour wait on a friday night! crazzyyy.... I just ended up getting my drinks and food at the bar. The bartenders were super friendly and the food and drinks came out fast  maybe because we were sitting in front of them.You whiners need to step aside and take that negativity elsewhere... if the snooty people stop coming it\'ll be an even happier place with less of a wait."
L V.,Fremont  CA,31,20,4,3/23/2011,5.0,If you were ask me how I would rate this place a year and a half ago  I would have given it a very low rating. Although I hesitated to go back here  I just wanted something close to home and the Pizookie's never let me down so I decided to give BJ's at this location another chance.We came here tonight and it was very crowded. We were told it would be a 35 to 45 minute wait. We waited and to our surprise we were called to be seated in 20 minutes. The manager was the one who seated us and he was very pleasant. It's nice to feel noticed and that is how his friendliness made us feel.Our waiter this evening was Anthony. Great server  friendly  courteous  and very attentive to our needs. Always smiling and very easy to talk to which is a plus. Good vibes  happy staff. It just makes us want to come back.We are thankful that we were able to have our avocado rolls since the last time we were here (over a year ago) they ran out and I was not happy. And thankful that our order came out exactly as ordered and in good time. Delicious too! Things have definitely improved since my last visit here.Thank you Mr. Manager and Anthony. Because of your great service tonight we will be back. Would I recommend this place to my family and friends? Absolutely.
Marsh-Silog P.,Union City  CA,51,243,2,11/18/2008,3.0,"This rating is more for 3.5 stars. Now I really can\'t stand deep dish pizza  its too greasy and not enough flavor....so I thought. Well BJ\'s is pretty greasy but I was pleasantly surprised with their pizza. I don\'t think it\'s as ""bomb"" as what people say but it was good and I would order pizza from here again. Cesar salad sucked though. The chicken wings with the spicy buffalo sauce was great and so was the white choco macadamia nut pizookie we had. My husband and I shared a small BJ\'s favorite with a Cesar salad and my cousins ordered lasagna  chicken pasta and a medium BJ\'s favorite also....they finished it so I guess they liked it.I only gave the rating because we had 2 dirty plates."
J. C.,Washington  DC,123,19,7,11/24/2008,4.0,I loved the BJs in Cupertino. This BJs is... pretty much the same thing.And now that BJs is here  I can confidently say BJs has the second best pizza in the Fremont/Newark area. The number one would be Mission Pizza.But BJ's deep dish pizza is a very close second and its atmosphere is superior to Mission Pizza's (big TVs  sports  brewery included  and rowdy young crowd.) As for the pizza  the crunch and bread in that deep dish is certainly a guilty pleasure and probably very fattening. But man  what else do you expect? Wash it down with a pint of their seasonal brew!Of course  having TWO HAPPY HOURS in one day is awesome. They have a happy hour from 5-7pm on weekdays and another one from 10pm to closing on Sunday-Thursday. Go then  and the quality-to-price ratio totally fits the bill and is well worth it.Watch out for the crowds though! For a shorter wait  try to grab a seat at the bar on front of the mega-screen and enjoy the rowdy atmosphere.
Kim-van T.,San Pablo  CA,163,439,292,11/30/2008,2.0,I was told this place was relatively new - so maybe they're still working the kinks out ?? i have a long list of complaints that i hope they fix before this place gets burned down by angry customers with torches and pitchforks...i was here for a birthday dinner last night and there were 13 of us - not TOO large of a party. unfortunately something went screwy with the reservations so instead of seating us at 7:30 i think we were actually seated closer to 8:30 (bummer #1).so mostly everyone at the table decided to split pizzas - so they ordered 5 pizzas. i wasn't that hungry so i ordered the grilled chicken stuffed potato. i didn't think that the food was coming out that slow - but i guess i was just used to it because i knew we had such a large party and the place was PACKED. so 4 out of the 5 pizzas all come at the same time and the servers were telling us how lucky we were for getting our pizzas within 20 minutes! too bad the pizza was COLD. and it's deep dish!!!! deep dish has natural self-insulating qualities - how the hell did the pizza come out cold?! anyways  so we were still waiting on the last pizza as well as someone's chicken alfredo and the server came over and apologized because we had to call him over to ask him to check on the rest of the orders. he then told us that the manager would be coming out to speak to us and possibly comp something for our patience. talk about being patient! the manager never came out! O-M-G-W-T-F. one plus  i tried the pumpkin ale - which i actually liked  very light with a hint of pumpkin - i'd recommend trying it. my potato was also.. luke-warm  although very tasty and HUGE - i could only eat half. hopefully this place gets its act together. the food is pretty decent - the service is lousy.
Jennifer J.,Oakland  CA,73,35,2,3/10/2009,1.0,CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS HERE! The food might actually be enjoyable if it weren't for the snotty twenty-something's running the damn joint. Me and a few coworkers stopped in for lunch at 1:00 PM and I didn't get my shrimp taco with a side of tortilla chips until about 1:45  please note...my coworkers ordered a side salad with soup! I had to ask the waitress when the food was coming out because I had to return to work and she looked at me like I asked her to bow down and kiss my feet...Hmph! I will AVOID this place like the plague...or at least until they've been in business for a few years and management steps their game up! Boo on BJ's!
S D.,Cupertino  CA,5,20,,7/9/2010,4.0,I decided to give a try to BJ's in Newark during Independence Day week end  I was craving for some baby back ribs. The lunch started with a really good clam chowder which had all the right proportions : lot of clams not too much potatoes  soon after I got the main course of baby back ribs and to my delight it was perfectly prepared : meat was coming off the bone and the sauce was good !In addition the restaurant was not crowded at all so we were seated right away!
Ada S.,Milpitas  CA,6,46,29,10/29/2013,1.0,Am I the only one who notice the difference in their pizzas? I don't know what happened but the quality of their pizzas went down the drain. I remembered about 2-3 years ago that their pizzas are cheesier with a lot more toppings. The first time I noticed the difference was about 2 years ago. I really thought they forgot to add pizza sauce and cheese because it was that dry! It was replaced by the same tasting pizza so I thought the cook was probably different that night. I finally gave it another try last Friday only to be once again disappointed. I had to ask for a pizza sauce on the side but that didn't help. I'm not sure if this is the only location that serves the dry pizza but my best friend who also loved BJ's pizza at one point noticed the same thing from the Socal area where she lives. Their thai shrimp lettuce wrap was also not as good as I remembered it. Our server was very friendly and energetic but his breath was really bad. Oh  they tried twice to serve us pizzas that wasn't ours. The first attempt was a female server who at least asked if the pizzas she was holding was our order and clearly it was not because I didn't see greens which should have been the bell peppers so I told her it was not our order. Five minutes later  a male came with the same looking pizza but this time this server did not ask if it was our order. He just automatically tried to place the pizza on our table until I stopped him and said that was not our pizza because I don't see any veggies on it. Lame! 3/4 star for the pazookie and 1/4 star for the calamari.
Sherry M.,San Leandro  CA,46,33,1,3/26/2011,3.0,This place is always busy. The average wait time is between 45 to 55 minutes. Then again  I was there on a Friday and Saturday nights. I like their beer samplers and appetizers. Save room for pizookie.
Kenny L.,Jersey City  NJ,275,614,25,2/22/2009,2.0,I like the sampler sets here  $9.95 can get you over two pints of beer. Problem is  their beers (save for the stout) taste like it's watered down. Subtle flavors and hoppiness is one thing  but watered down is something different and unforgivable.Brewpubs should have better beer than this. I am surprised that somebody has finally made a microbrew that tastes like a macrobrew. The Red  Brown Ale and Porter could have been excellent (nice malts) if the beers weren't watered down.Pizza was in a deep-dish style was was pretty good. Not because it was good deep dish  but the flavor combinations were adventurous and well put together. Service was so-so at best.This place has so much potential  but I don't think they will ever fulfill it.
Jessica L.,San Jose  CA,329,79,,9/18/2009,4.0,I've been to BJ's before in SJ  but this one is near my new house  so we decided to go check it out. They are usually busy for dinner so there was a bit of a wait  but that's to be expected at most places on a weekend night. We got seated and got a wonderful waiter who made sure we were kept happy and well fed. He talked over beer suggestions with my boyfriend and helped him decide on one that would go well with his meal. I got the shrimp tacos and they were really good. I also ordered a side salad with the creamy garlic dressing that has now become a favorite of mine. We ordered potato skins and they were the standard fair  nothing special  but good. We had the kidlet with us and she dropped part of her grilled cheese on the floor and they promptly offered to replace it. Other waiters/waitresses offered to refill our drinks if they saw they were low and everyone was nice to us. All is all a great experience and above standard customer service. We have gone back a couple times and every time this has been our experience.They have plenty of big screens so you can watch the game and a decent selection of beers to try as well as draft root beer  cream soda  and black cherry soda. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because while the food is good  it is standard chain restaurant fair. Good food  I'll eat it again  but not one of those meals that makes you want to run and tell all your friends. I would most definitely recommend this place to people looking for a nice meal in a decent place. The atmosphere is high scale sports bar. Little bit of fun  but a definitely above the average decor at a chain restaurant. They have call ahead seating and I highly recommend using it. Beware  not the best place for large groups  unless you plan ahead.
Roopali S.,Fremont  CA,2,33,,9/12/2014,1.0,Where do I begin. After a long wait I called ahead to be informed that there is no option to reserve seat for three or more persons in advance and i was conveniently added in call ahead sheet or list or whatever that is supposed to be. It was my husband's birthday so I asked them to inform the server to add that in as well. I was told that the request was considered but you need to again inform when you walk-in. I was like OK! Come evening my husband and I with our child check in and are told that unfortunately we were never added on the call ahead list so now you have to wait like all others. On top of that the server we got couldn't follow an ounce of English and brought food in like super late. Finally the surprise never happened I went and asked the manager and he says will take care of it again I wait patiently requesting my husband to sit at the table one way or the other nothing happened. I paid the check and expressed my disappointment to the manager on the way out he didn't seem to give rat's ass. Well so much for loving BJ's. I visited the one in Cupertino so much practically did a project on them at school. Now I feel some other deserving restaurant could have had been my subject of observation. Well never mind I for one am never going back to others who want to venture out all I say is good luck! Manager manager wake up. This action and mismanagement of yours will bite you someday in you know where! Karma is a bitch!
Sandra A.,Union City  CA,0,2,,4/30/2013,1.0,"I have gone to BJ""s in Newark many times  since it has opened  but today was an absolutely horrible experience. My server did her job fine. But my lunch  a french dip sandwich was gruesome. When it came out it was WELL DONE and the french roll burnt. Also there was only about 2 thin sliced pieces of meat dried as could be. They offered to make me a new one  which they did  but by time it arrived my lunch hour was over and I needed to take it back to work. When it first opened it was top notch  but it has fallen way down. Not sure I would go back."
Jade K.,Newark  CA,0,7,,3/12/2015,3.0,"it takes forever to be seated  i understand it gets pretty busy during dinner time but the hostess lie about the estimated time they say it takes about 20 minutes but its more like the double of the time so if you do happen to go there and they say ""itll be like 20 minutes"" just think of it as a 40 minute wait! by the time you get seated it takes like 15 minutes for a server to approach to get you started with some drinks however the food is really good i love their appetizers and is the closet location from my house so over all its ok"
Noe R.,San Leandro  CA,39,39,6,12/7/2008,4.0,sorry people i know your expecting some sort of phallic joke but it is just way too easy for this place. But any who...A while back i passed this place up while going to the mall. I had not herd of BJs before so i had no idea what they served but some friends told me that they brew their own beer. 0.0 Brew their own beer?? hells yea. For anyone that doesn't know me i LOVE micro breweries so needless to say i was aching to come try it. I shared a large deep dish pizza with a couple on our table. Don't remember the exact name of it but i think it was the BJs special or something. The bread was soft and certain parts were crunchy. It was delicious. I also tried the BBQ chicken pizza that another person in our table had. It was good too but not as good as ours. We also ordered a dessert. a pazookie i was told. This dish is one of the best desserts i have had. Great flavor but had a homey vibe to it that makes you think you can recreate it at home. Also our service was top notch. Our lady server was hella funny. I was talking shit with my friends and what not and she was even giving me some comebacks. Very cool girl and witty. Also she gave us some stuff for free and gave us a discount  I'm guessing it was the shit talking and goofing around we did with her. Her service was 5 stars.For their beer... eh i wasn't impressed. i had the porter and the piranha i believe. Everyone was talking about how good their beer is and what not. I'm not going to lie  its good but theirs better places around like buffalo bills brewery. I do love their bar though. It is a beautiful bar and huge TV in the middle that splits all the sports games 3x3. But don't worry  each channel is still great quality  the TV is that big.Overall i love a good old fashion BJs. eh i lied  i love saying sex jokes.
Tim C.,Berkeley  CA,246,181,27,11/29/2010,4.0,Great pizza  beer  and pizookies. Long waits though. Even calling ahead to put your name on the waitlist does not help much. BJ's favorite  BJ's red  and any type of pizookie? Heaven. And diabeeetttusss.
Keith H.,Newark  CA,1,11,,6/6/2012,3.0,Inconsistent. Been here multiple times. Sometimes there is nearly no wait and other times it is insane. Don't make reservations  the BJs franchise as a whole are not good at keeping them. They're often busy and can't exactly keep a table empty for a group who may not show. Food is good stuff despite what others say. Restaurants are often hit or miss with waitresses/waiters and service but BJs is more hit-or-miss than others. But try it for yourself  some people just sound really angry here.
Will S.,San Jose  CA,98,208,84,7/15/2009,3.0,"After spending a LOOOOOONG time deciding on where to go after dinner  we settled on this BJ\'s in Newark. Good thing for us  it was happy hour. So out of all the BJ\'s I know  THIS ONE has a revolving door. We walked in around 10pm and happy hour seating was scarce. There were barely seats open at the bar and we needed 4 spots. Some guy sitting at the bar was being shady  not wanting to move down one seat so that our group could sit together. JERK. Luckily one of the bartenders pointed out a table open for us to sit. (Good lookin\' out). We all ordered a round of shots first  then moved onto beers. We started off with Patron-chilled. Always good. A friend of mine said there wasn\'t enough salt on his glass. So he tried adding more to it with the table salt. Haha. It was a no-go but good try. We followed the shots with a round of beer. I had a P.M. Porter. It was a nice dark beer (usually good for meaty dishes). Mmmm. Real smooth. I forget what kind of beer 2 of my friends ordered but it was a light beer  rather sweet. I had a sip and liked it very much. Another friend of mine ordered a Jeremiah Red. It was somewhat of a dark beer but still had a nice crisp to it. That same friend and I decided to take another shot of Grey Goose-chilled. Seriously  chilled is the way to go.The check was somewhere around $55. But I wound up paying $20  tax and tip for my 2 shots and beer. Quite good  being that it was happy hour.Service was great. Our server kept checking in on us to make sure everything was ok  even if we did just order drinks. The location was a bit questionable. I pulled up and saw some abandoned building behind B.J.\'s with some graffiti and automatically thought ""O...K. Ghetto."" I shouldn\'t be one to judge but I couldn\'t help myself. Anyway  this B.J.\'s was nice and perhaps I\'ll return sometime in the future. But I\'m from San Jose and there are closer ones nearby. So maybe I\'ll settle for those  unless I\'m in the East Bay."
Kermy K.,Fremont  CA,25,310,,5/11/2009,2.0,Great for drinks and sports. Not good for food. Their utensils and plates are so dirty. So many times I've found bugs in the glasses or left over things on forks and the benches/chairs. Their food is bleh. I found a hair in the pizza once. Their shrimp in pasta is theeeee tiniest shrimp I have ever seen. I felt bad eating it bc I thought it musta been a baby shrimp. Forget about counting calories in the food. The desserts are sorry. Can't recommend this place.
Marcy B.,Newark  CA,0,11,,5/27/2010,4.0,"Happy  happy  happy! First time for my sweetie & I - return trip for our friends. An early Sat. evening supper turned out remarkably well in service and cuisine. Our attentive waitress was both super cheerful and attended to us perfectly. Three of us ordered a new menu item  the pulled pork sandwich accompanied by delectable coleslaw and fries. OK  so forego the sauce on the side as it\'s way too sweet but the meat is pleasingly tasty without it anyway. Sampling both ""fat"" & ""skinny"" fries  I loved the seasoned coating and recommend the plump version as the one to opt for.One table member ordered a colorful  attractive  Italian dinner salad  however she found it tasted bland. She requested a different dressing plus a side of parmesean which were promptly served; she seemed appeased with the supplemental trimmings. Having advance knowledge of B J\'s exclusive creme soda and root beer  I opted for the former. So delicate and smooth  it was nothing like that traditional  harsh grocery store beverage. Bottom line  the experience was amazingly positive for this Newark chain eatery. In fact  I enjoyed the meal more than those I\'ve feasted on at the Claim Jumper. Plus the ambiance is a notch more comfortable too. We\'ll be coming back soon as I\'m anxious to try out B J\'s jambalaya!"
Naren C.,Fremont  CA,0,11,,5/21/2012,2.0,Not a huge fan of this place and its mainly because of the wait  but also because their food is mediocre at best. The deep dish pizza is nothing like it should be  it should have layers of sauce  toppings  and cheese but its just a buncha dough. They have more than routinely gotten my order incorrect  which I don't really appreciate after having to wait a half hour for my food. At that point it's not really worth sending back and risk it coming back with spit  a half hour later.
Rachelle R.,Fremont  CA,55,69,27,12/3/2008,3.0,I took away two stars due to my experience last night. Good 'ol tuesday night...a girlfriend and i make our way to grab a beer(PM Porter  it's my favorite right now) and the bartender tells me that they are OUT of ALL but one of their HOUSE brewed beers! It was such a bummer. It's like going to Baskin Robin's to enjoy the options of 31 flavors and they tell you they are out of vanilla  chocolate  strawberry and chocolate chip??!! I asked the bartender if he could suggest a similar type beer and he pretty much offered me a Guiness. ew. I could go to Safeway and buy a can. No thank you sir.Here's a tip: Beer comes in on Wednesday's  Tuesday is the WORST day to go. If i would have known ahead of time  i would have just went to Mission Pizza off Washington Blvd.what i love about BJ's in Newark:1. PM Porter is a MUST2. Awesome Pizza...seriously  there is a reason why the pizza is pricey. You get what you pay for.3. Location Location Location4. approx. 46 beers on tap5. the bar television is awesome for Warrior games6. PAZOOKIE!!!
Emery T.,Fremont  CA,42,81,,10/13/2009,4.0,I was really excited when I found out a BJ's was coming to Newark. The closest one was in Cupertino (which is about 35 minutes away from where I am). I really like their single serving pizzas. If you go at a non typical time (say 2 o clock) you can get seated right away. However  If you go during regular busy hours (dinner time or weekends)  you will have to wait a very long time to get seated. I  personally  have never had terrible service during these busy times. But I have heard from more than one source that their service is lacking quite a bit. If you have never been here  you have to try the pizookie (Pizza cookie)!! It's to die for...well if you have a major sweet tooth!
Stephone B.,Hayward  CA,1,14,,1/15/2012,5.0,Our server was great she recommended beer and deserts that were slammed by my wife and son. We will be going back soon!
K.D. C.,Danville  CA,3,53,11,1/8/2011,2.0,Was not impressed with the food. The burger was made of low quality meat. Nice place to watch sports and have a drink but I wouldn't get in the habit of eating there.
Chi L.,Union City  CA,6,250,26,11/18/2009,3.0,Ok  when I first saw BJ Brewery is about to open in Newark  I am excited and happy.But I also worry that a lot of time  even with CHAIN restaurant  the fremont version(or newark version) is the worst compared to other location.When this BJ first open  the shrimp pasta dish I got   is not that good  the pasta is not even 100% cooked(very hard).Now  I went back for second time  after a few months later  food seem to be better. Actually this is one of the good chain restaurant I like.I am glad this location is getting better  but the waiting line could be long even in thursday night  so plan accordingly. The price and portion is pretty good deal in this restaurant. Beer is good. I am still happy that there is BJ in Fremont/Newark area. Since this Fremont area  usually has NOT MUCH RESTAURANTS to choose from. Oh  I forget to say the desert is pretty good.
Rob S.,Newark  CA,26,10,,3/1/2012,1.0,"I\'ve been to this BJ\'s many times only because of the fact of ""going along with it"" The service.. Wait there is no service. The waiters are slower then slow the food is horrible  no really it\'s HORRIBLE. The only thing good there is the beer and that\'s not even good. I don\'t know how that place is still in business. Go somewhere else folks. Go anywhere but there. I wish there were negative stars to give."
Michelle W.,Union City  CA,187,389,1256,3/30/2009,3.0,So I have mixed reviews about BJ's. Let me break it down:FOOD - 4 stars. Huge portions  great flavor  wide variety. My favorite are the chicken wangs and deep dish pizza. It's even more delicious during happy hour because appetizers are $2 off and mini pizzas are half off. Even though there's a huge selection of beer  I like their berry cider for HH. And onto their famous pizookies  that alone deserves 5 stars. I used to get the white chocolate & macadamia cookie  until I discovered OREO PIZOOKIE aka the holy grail of pizookies.LOCATION - 2 stars. Don't get me wrong  I've been saying BJ's needed to come to Fremont for years now and I was escstatic when they did  but what's up with opening it up in a run down plaza across the street from Newpark? I know there's going to be tons of remodeling in that area  so I hope they remodel the parking lot cuz it's a lil retarded. I would think Pacific Commons off Automall would've been more adequate.SERVICE - 2 stars. Very mediocre to me. It's a challenge trying to flag them down. One of the HH waitresses tried to rip me off the other day by keeping my change in her folder thinking she was going to get an $18 tip for a $40 tab. Girrrrrl  you must be trippin! Good thing my Chinese math skills kicked into gear and I spoke up when I figured I should be getting $10 in change  or else she would've walked off with my monies. That was shady.I always run into Logan people here. Might as well have a reunion. =)
Vinay B.,Union City  CA,8,6,1,2/20/2012,5.0,The best thing to ever happen in Fremont! Go here quite often after a long day at work or for somewhere work discussions! Very friendly staff..great beer.. Could improve on the Single malt collection (hence the 4 stars ;-)) appetizers are gr8 and ofcourse don't leave without a pizookie!
Nin R.,San Jose  CA,22,159,74,8/9/2009,4.0,Love their burgers here. The burger on sourdough roll just kills it. Their spinach artichoke dip is also a great appetizer.I'll give it up to their pizzokie (sp?) though. It's awesome! My friends and I love to order the party size pizzokie. It's about the size of a large pizza.I'd pass on their drinks though. A little over priced. Save yourself some money and goto the liquor store just across the freeway ;)
My C.,Oakland  CA,86,266,302,6/2/2009,2.0,"If the service was any worst  I\'d really need to write an angry letter to corporate or something.. I really wouldn\'t expect that type of treatment from a chain restaurant. Our server was absolutely horrible and the only thing giving this review 2 stars is the decent food. First one into the restaurant and last one out  WHY? because our server didn\'t want to put in our order till all in our parties  though we insisted her to fire it up  had arrived and were ready. But how would the others in our party order if they didn\'t get the chance to see the menu? I\'m pretty sure she was on something because she needed us to repeat ourselves twice on everything. We saw the food runner/other server WAY MORE often than her. And to top it all off  her way of getting us out was..""Is this(the check) ready? I have to go home."" We would\'ve been long gone if you had first given us our food 30 minutes earlier on in the visit! If you ever get the chance to choose your server  stay away from her. I\'m assuming she works day time only  blonde curly hair  and looks sort of old. It seems service is just lacking here after looking at other reviews. I never had a problem with the Oakridge Mall location in San Jose. I\'m hoping if I ever go back to this location  the service will be better."
Sophia N.,Newark  CA,100,90,2,8/8/2011,3.0,I'm surprised to see that this place has some really high reviews. I think it's only an alright spot. The lunch specials for food is definitely a great deal and the tvs while sitting at the bar makes it a good place to catch an afternoon game  but I don't think the food is especially great. I recently have found that the french dip is very yummy and I prefer their flatbread pizzas over their normal pizzas because the regular ones come with way too much dough. Their beers are good  but their mixed drinks always come out weak. I think most people come for the ambiance more than anything. Eh  I don't hate it  but wouldn't be sad if they closed down.
Steve T.,San Jose  CA,62,34,55,9/13/2011,4.0,this place is nice  like a pf changs or whatever restaurant.we came impromptu to watch the packers/saints game. and got on the waiting list for a table. while waiting some guy came around and gave out complimentary pizza slices. what a nice guy.the waitress was quite a friendly personanyways the pizza was good  the strawberry mojito was good. and the pizookie is always good.
Loren John B.,Beaverton  OR,135,424,177,11/30/2008,3.0,So I came into town earlier this weekend to find out this place just opened up recently. I thought this place would take over where the Circuit City or Rasputins used to be. Nope. Its smack dab in the middle of the parking lot. I didn't realize all the cars there were meant for BJ's customers. And the dining area is probably the smallest among the other BJ's I've been to. Yikes. My friend told me that all the other BJs in the Bay (i.e. Foster City and San Jose) that they don't allow you to phone in for reservations  but apparently this place did. Ugh.We needed a table for a party of 8  and the wait would be an hour and a half tops. Double ugh. Mind you this was at 7pm  so since its new I guess it makes sense. I showed up with one of my friends a little early and we chilled at the bar. Fortunately  one big party left their table and we swooped in right away. For the record its open seating at the bar  so we lucked out. Service was extra slow and they got our order wrong... in a good way. One of my buddies ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls and never got it. We asked for waters for everyone and that took half an hour. Our shots of Patron for the entire table took awhile too. If it wasn't for being surrounded by good company  we would have complained more haha. As far as getting out order wrong  we ordered 2 large pizzas  the BJ's favorite (my personal fave) and the Great White. Our pizzas came out to one small and one medium pizza  so instead of getting 8 slices per large pizza  we got 10 pieces with the two smaller pizzas of each flavor. Woot. I'm glad there's a BJ's much closer to my home without having to drive all the way to deep San Jose or across the bridge to Foster City. I haven't had it in awhile so it was nice. I'm just not fond of it being smaller than the other BJ's I've been to and the service needs some work too. They also need to revitalize the rest of that shopping center  especially now that the new Mervyn's is closing. I'll review this again if I end up coming back at a later time. And now i just realized that none of us ordered pizookies. Oh well. Cheerio.
Amanda Y.,San Francisco  CA,18,26,1,12/21/2008,2.0,"This place really is ""meh"". I like BJ\'s  especially the ones in San Mateo and Cupertino  but this location is terrible! I decided to come here with a group of my friends for my birthday  and I really wish I didn\'t.  The waiters/waitresses aren\'t very attentive to customers\' needs. My friends and I felt so ignored practically the whole night and our waitress hardly ever came back to ask if we needed anything. We pretty much had to flag her down every time we needed something. Our food came out at really random times too. I think a friend of mine waited 20 minutes after everyone else got their food and it was only a burger.I would suggest getting a reservation at least a week in advanced if you want to eat here without waiting 45+ minutes. It is packed at almost all hours of the day  except if you come in during the weird times like 4-5 in the evening. I think the waiters and waitresses have a lot of growing to do in their profession and I probably won\'t come back to this location for at least 6 months. Maybe everyone will have their act down by then. I think coming here for a quick drink would be everyone\'s best bet."
Ann T.,San Jose  CA,1,40,,4/2/2011,4.0,Love the food  this is one of my favorite restaurants  but my first time at this location. 10pm on Friday and had a 20 min wait. I was surprised how crowded it was! The closed Mervyn's parking lot was packed. Interesting patrons...as I was getting seated  a table that was leaving had to carry one of their drunk buddies out. Wow. But the food was great! Spicy marinara sauce gave the chicken parmigiana a nice kick  and we had to try their new dessert: beignet with strawberries  ice cream  and whip cream! Must try!
Krista T.,Pleasant Hill  CA,208,159,3,3/8/2009,3.0,"Read a lot of reviews about bad service but I had just the opposite. My waitress was ""Zaida"" very nice and attentive. The staff seemed friendly. The food was ok  I got the pizza  although my son loved the pizza. My friend got grilled chicken with mashed potatoes on a bed of lettuce and they really liked their meal.CONS: The parking lot is horrible  needs to be repaved."
Ray R.,Newark  CA,41,163,7,11/22/2008,2.0,Definitely has its new restaurant kinks to work out. Wait was long  even for calling in to be added to the wait-list. On they phone they said 20min  when we got there it was less than 50min (on a Thursday night). Their Mojito is really a limeade with A MINT LEAF. And yes the root-beer is not like the sugared/carbonated A&W stuff you grew up on  so don't worry. The food was alright seeing that I ordered a medium veggie pizza sans cheese. A country fried steak was also ordered and surprisingly huge.Give it six months to work out its problems  and let the novelty of it all ware off a little.
Radha X.,Oakland  CA,9,151,4,8/19/2009,3.0,"Went here for the first time. Liked the atmostphere...casual  but not too rowdy. Their drink menu is extensive and i liked their ""beer sampler"" even though I didn\'t like half of the beer.Food was ok. I got the jambalaya...but it was more like stir fry. And my boyfriend got one of their deep dish pizzas  and that was only ok too. Overall I got the impression of a wanna be cheese cake factory. Or many more like an Elephant bar. One thing I liked was they had a detailed ""nutrition"" index for everything on their menu. Not that I changed my mind on my entree choice ;-)"
Henry S.,Dublin  CA,388,1497,49,11/14/2008,4.0,Came here last night (Thursday night) around 9:45pm and there was still at 20 minute wait! Yes I know its only the 3rd day they were open but they are still working out their kinks. First the bad....I over heard the table next to us complaining to the manager that they have been waiting over 2 hours for their food. People who were seated after them got their food  ate and had already left. The lady was soo pissed (I wouldn't blame her either) but the manager comped their entire meal.Service was a little slow but that's expected when a new restaurant opens. Our table ordered the large sampler plate. It was good but the spinach artichoke dip was not cooked all they way through. It was COLD in the middle. We told the waitress and she brought us another one. She was slightly slow on keeping our drinks filled but I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt.We all ordered their deep dish pizza. All of them came out hot and really good. No complaints on the food. OK the most exciting thing for me about this place was the BIG ASS TV right above the bar. You can see it from just about every booth in the place. The GSW game was on so there was tons of fans yelling and cheering. Great location also....right off the Mowry exit off 880 across the street from New Park. As our Governor would say...I'll Be Back!
Tara A.,Newark  CA,189,19,1,7/7/2010,5.0,We come to BJ's for Sunday Funday... I have to say I have a slight addiction to Bloody Mary's on a Sunday afternoon. But not just any Bloody Mary... the bartender John makes THE BEST BLOODY MARY IN THE WORLD!!! It's spicy  it's shaken to perfection  the amount of ice is perfect. And on that little stick he puts a beautiful celery stalk  green beans  a pepper and a few olives  don't forget the lime. He even rims the glass with salt and pepper. I'm telling you this man is the Bloody Mary MASTER!! Thank you John for letting me enjoy those Sunday afternoons  is there any way to get a fixed schedule just for Bloody Mary making? The food is awesome too!! Always get a buffalo chicken pizza!! mmmm mmmm good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tom Y.,Carlsbad  CA,119,676,294,3/29/2009,4.0,I have to say I m not going to go back for the food again on my own accord  its overpriced and bland. Their own brand beers are not bad but nothing to write home about (I am a beer snob) but they have a selection of imported beers that is incredible european beers that are hard to find  for the first time in draft form I have seen in the bay area in such variety.
Alexandra G.,Milpitas  CA,73,216,136,8/7/2011,4.0,2 for 20 deal what a steal. Soup or a salad ANY medium sized pizza and a pizookie. Left very full and satisfied and no they did not skimp on quality either.
Gerald D.,Fremont  CA,76,75,3,4/23/2009,4.0,When this place first opened  it was soooooo busy for the first few months. Now  it has leveled off.My first visit to this place and luckily  it wasn't busy when we arrived at about 5:30p. We were seated promptly.We had Cory as our server. He's half Asian  half Caucasian. He's real humble.We ordered a Bruschetta to start off with. The bread was toasted with Parmesan cheese and the tomato salsa was served on the side. Tasty.My mom ordered the Angel Hair Toscana. Although there's no kind of meat in this dish  the flavor is bursting in every bite!Then we split a large BJ's Favorite Deep-Dish pizza. The Italian sausage is off the hook. It was a bit strange that my mom and my sister complained that the pizza crust wasn't cook though. The complained that it is too doughy. They say the crust at Pizzeria Uno's is better  which I agree upon  but I don't have any complaints about the crust.The interior has a nice contemporary look on the inside. They have HD screens along the walls. However  there are some mirrors that are hanged on the wall that seems out of place...I would definitely come back here and try their other items on the menu.
Rick R.,Fremont  CA,0,12,,2/26/2012,4.0,First time for me  I went there Sat 2/25/12  and had the Ahi Salad. It was delicious. Perfect Ahi and delicious fresh greens. A meal in itself for guys like me who don't need 3000 calories/day.I'll go back for that anytime!
Angel G.,Union City  CA,228,205,122,6/18/2009,3.0,Service was ok  wait was about 20 minutes and that was on a weekday! Food was ok  the best part was the Pizookie! We were able to take it to go because my son got sick. The waitress was able to put our ice creams in a 2go container & hooked us up with another Pizookie because my son's meal came with a sundae but wasn't able to eat it. So she gave us a Pizookie for free!
Erica R.,Highlands Ranch  CO,51,178,,4/10/2009,4.0,Ok  I totally love this place. Great food. I'm especially a fan of the broccoli cheddar soup. I really like the decor as well. My man and I have been here a few times. They have tons of great options for different types of dishes. There's everything from soup and salad to burgers  to pizza.The drinks are always great. My Cosmo or Sex on the Beach are never weak. My boyfriend is super picky about drinks (having been a bar tender and all) and he raved about his Long Island.My only complaint is that you can't make reservations for parties under 10 people. And if you don't have reservations  sometimes the wait can be as long as an hour and a half. If you do decide to go with a group smaller than 10  call ahead. But the wait will still be 30 min.
Athens r.,Union City  CA,56,135,,4/9/2009,3.0,I just wanted to see the bar  really. Good place to try next time. yes the trip was justifiable. Didnt really come here for food  but since its my first  thered be next time to review this place. Id definitely be writing an update. I didnt get to ask and sit if they had a happy hour  but which place like this doesnt? For the dine in sitting-- Elephant bar was better for me  seems like its crowded and congested on the floor and something somehow feels the floor was dug low. Good place to chill.
Vera T.,Fremont  CA,16,10,,11/30/2008,3.0,I agree with the other reviewers  it's a long wait for actual seating. Last Wednesday  a table for 6 at 5pm was 1 hour and 45min. So instead of waiting to get seated tonight  we went straight to the bar area (first come first serve open seating). We waited no more then 10 mins for a table to open up. The service was decent and the Mediterranean Pizza was really good.
Sam S.,San Diego  CA,2,30,5,12/20/2011,5.0,Classic BJs  but it's a big one  a little nicer  and big selection on the menu.
Hannah r.,Hayward  CA,11,2,,12/13/2011,4.0,This place is clean and the people are helpful. Every time I have been the wait has not been long  even though the place is packed. It's fun for every one even if youre under 21. The personsal pizza dishes are super good  better than your average pizza  its filling and not to expensive  they give out icecream dishes to thoe celebrating bdays  and if you like to watch the football game with a beer  good service and good food its the place to hit up..
Laura G.,Newark  CA,8,6,1,11/16/2008,3.0,"The first time I had BJ\'s was in Maui. It was so good we ate it three times in one week! So  when I saw there would be a new one in Newark  I was elated! Having worked in the industry during college  I knew the grand opening would be crazy and full of kinks.To avoid the madness  we decided to order take-out. You can actually order online  but I chose to call it in  just to be sure I got exactly what I wanted. I ordered a large sausage and cheese deep dish pizza (uncut  because it stays hotter). The girl on the phone answered right away and was very nice. She told me the order would take only 10 minutes. I thought to myself  ""What? A deep dish in 10 minutes?""When I arrived  I thought I would be able to park in the ""take out"" parking. The policy is that if you do  they will come to you and bring our food. Well  that didn\'t happen. The parking lot is a mess and the ""take out"" spots were full. I had to circle three times before I found a parking spot. Grrr...hopefully this will change soon!Take out has its own entrance with a hostess at the front to greet you. The place inside is nice. It\'s about time Newark has something a little more hip than Swiss Park! When I arrived  I was helped right away and my pizza was ready and waiting. I opened the pizza to make sure the order was correct. What I saw inside was nothing like the BJ\'s I remember in Maui. Having a husband from Chicago  I have become very particular about my pizza. Real Chicago pizza has thick dough  sauce  toppings and then the cheese on top. This pizza looked like doughy foccaccia with no sauce  a little cheese and then some sausage on top. (BJ\'s used to claim it was Chicago pizza...is it no more?) I immediately asked for extra sauce and was pleasantly accomadated.When I arrived home and opened it up for my husband  he turned up is nose. We wondered if it was microwaved or pre-made  as it was ready in only ten minutes????? Anywho  we were hungry  so we ate it. I dipped my bites in the extra sauce and it was actually fabulous! I guess that is the key! It\'s not as good as the pizza I had in paradise  but it certainly is one of the better ones in the local area. I think we will do a dine in experience in a few weeks after they have a chance to get the kinks out. :)"
Randy T.,Manteca  CA,2,2,1,6/29/2012,1.0,"Worst service I have ever had. After taking 10 minutes to get drinks after we were seated  our server told us he was going on break and another server would be taking care of us. We sat for twenty five minutes without even a look from our new ""server"". Even after speaking with management it didn\'t improve. My wife and I got our drinks refilled once  we had to ask for my son\'s and my daughter never got a refill. This was the first time I\'ve not left a tip. HORRIBLE STAFF!!!!"
John B.,Fremont  CA,1,23,,3/5/2012,1.0,Always understaffed and the food comes barely warm. Waited for more than an hour and another 45 minutes to get the drinks. Will not go there again.+1 star for awesome beer.
Neil R.,Newark  CA,224,368,122,5/17/2009,4.0,Dude this is a pretty sick place to hang out  grad a bite to eat and drink. Watch some cool shit on TV. And they have quite the selection. Great energy and ambiance. Their menu just looks delicious. I've tried some of their pizzas  salads  other chicken pasta and or otherwise dishes and damn it... its pure sex. I haven't yet picked something I didn't like. Always a hit. You see... I don't like trying new dishes cause at most places they disappoint. So to avoid that... I play it safe. But at BJ's... I know I will be OK with trying something new. I am not a beer drinker and this place does brew their own mix... so I usually get their root-beer and again - a hit. I love it. PLUS: Food  taste  speed and accuracy of service  parking  accessibility  things to do around the area  the decor and ENERGY of the place  and the staff! MINUS: Sometimes there's a bit of a wait... but worth it. OVERALL: Once you get seated  you'll have a blast. Enjoy!
Helen T.,Phoenix  AZ,0,7,,1/23/2012,1.0,"I know there\'s a lot of lovers of the pizookie famed BJ\'s brewery  but i just had THE WORST experience ever!!! My mom  husband  and I wanted to watch the 49ers game this past Sunday  along with 3 other people. So there were 6 of us. I called to make a reservation for the bar  since we were a big party  I thought it\'d be fine. The girl on the phone said she had a booth in the bar  3rd row back reserved for us at 2:15. Cool.But we get there and the guy at the front says  ""Sorry  we don\'t do reservations. And the bar is open seating anyway."" I have worked in a fine-dining atmosphere for years  and I realize that this is just casual but all dining protocol says that this in itself warrants one free dessert. Furthermore  management didn\'t stand behind their employees  but rather blamed us  the diners  for not knowing that they don\'t make reservations. HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW?!?Then they screwed up my food order  forgot to put three of the six chairs and silverware sets at the table (so half of us were left standing for 10 minutes until we went and got our own chairs)  and then forgot to put in our pizookie order but didn\'t realize it for HALF AN HOUR! The manager finally brought one out for us  didn\'t appologize  just ""there it is"".The only saving grace was the waitress that relieved our original  forgetful one. Rose  I think her name was. She was very polite up until we signed the check  then she didn\'t care who we were after when we asked for to-go boxes.Overall a terrible experience by front of house and management alike. Food tasted good (great job BOH) and was hot when it eventually came out. But I am still NEVER going back!!!"
Shira O.,San Francisco  CA,162,332,202,8/4/2010,3.0,Went to the 10-close happy hour last night. Tuesday is 1/2 off bottle of wine/glass night...not to shabby. Discounts on lots of things if you sit in the bar area only. Service is nothing to sneeze at  but I like my beer  wine and pizza cheap and happy hour at this place hits the mark.
Joanne H.,San Leandro  CA,291,271,21,4/7/2010,4.0,see  i'd never thought i'd do it.. to give Bj's higher than a one star... or even set foot into one ever again! BUT it was either this place of Elephant Bar and i could swear i'd give them both the same bad ratings. Since i havent step foot into here for about 5 years now  I thought they might have improved while Elephant Bar just went down the drain.Well.. they did good.BUFFALO WINGS : crispySPINACH ARTICHOKE DEEP DISH PIZZA: goodOREO PIZOOKIE: oh em gee. So good. even from my last bad experience from BJ's  i told myself i'd only go back for this... and yes it's still so worth it. at end of the night  i had to take off my belt to breathe. KILLED THE PIZOOKIE! murdered it. yummmmm
Max M.,Phoenix  AZ,0,46,,11/19/2013,3.0,Four of us met here for lunch on Friday at 11:30. The place was at 10 percent capacity. We did not want a booth. Our table was in unserviceable zone. I asked a wait staff to find our waiter. No one showed up. So I went to the front and requested a waiter. The fellow was warm and friendly  he took our order  but switch us to someone else right after our drinks arrived. Food was good  tasty and inexpensive. We had unlimited time for lunch but if we did not  the initial confusion on behalf of wait staff would have hampered our plans. I still give them 3 star for the food and service. Will go back for food.
Max N.,Hayward  CA,70,52,30,3/30/2009,3.0,Good place  hard to get a spot sometimes when it is busy  but the food/beer is good  and the restaurant is new and pretty clean.Their pizza is awesome although fairly pricy. Good alternative to Gordon Biersh.Taking the rating down 1 star due to experience on 4/3/09. Called ahead at 10.30pm asked if they were busy  they told me no  come on down... once there i had to wait 30 min for a table  and got a stunned look at the counter when I asked if a wait is their definition of not being busy.Person that sat us down was kinda rude about IDs claimed that we didn't look 21 wtf... Then they gave us our $5 bill back claiming their machine didn't work with it?!?! Seriously wtf... Pizza was still good  and beer was good also. place was clean as always.
Fikret O.,Newark  CA,65,9,,12/23/2013,4.0,pizzas are awesome  good draft beer options. little corwded...
Andrea M.,Hayward  CA,142,403,220,1/26/2009,4.0,I've been here plenty of times since it opened  including one time before it opened for free food!! :D  and i've had good experiences so far. haven't seemed to have any problems with the hosts/servers yet  so i can't complain about that. i loveeeee the food here. the pizza is hella good.. another thing i like to order is the parmesan crusted chicken (yum!).. the appetizers that i've tried are good  too. i think of all the times i've been here  i haven't had anything i didn't like. i dont think you can go wrong with the food here.
Jackie D.,San Jose  CA,600,386,31,4/14/2010,3.0,Wait time is forever with food no matter how big your party. i'm not a big fan of chain places but this isn't too bad. they have baked potatoes and i do love me some potatoes. that's what i usually get every time and a side salad. i always feel like a fatass after i'm done but it's kinda worth it....well maybe not the price. i can only vouch for the potatoes and beer. everything else? i think it's just normal chain food. too heavy  too greasy  too plain.
Rita H.,San Jose  CA,1,19,3,9/13/2013,1.0,This review is strictly for security guy at night time. Real example of RUDE. Bjs manager should train him more properly. Other than that service was great and food was good.
Allen Y.,San Jose  CA,4,25,6,12/21/2008,5.0,Sheesh  we got a lot of tough customers out here. Judging from the review trends  my critique will possibly be the handful of 5 stars the Newark BJs will get. Well anyways I had a great experience coming here.This BJs has a unique set up which is different from the other BJs I went to  which were Foster City  and Tanforan. It has like a main floor which has easy access to view the the multi-sport screens at the bar  and the flat screens surrounding the floor. From where I was sitting it almost felt like a theater. In attention to food  the pizza is awesome. I'm a pizza lover  and I have to say BJs pizza is my number one favorite as of now. I don't care what people say but BJs is better than Pizza Chicago. The dough has smooth consistency  the pizza toppings are premium grade  and the crust is soft and crispy. Yum. As for service  our waitress was friendly  and nice. She was attentive  and quick in responding to our requests. I think people should give new opening businesses a break. People have such high expectations for new businesses thinking they'll pamper them with 5 star treatment. It is like expecting the first generation iphone to not have no defects when you clearly know that first systems launches always have some sort of problems.(terrible tangent) lol. But anyways chill guys  don't beat them down  but give the manager some feedback if there is such a big issue. (possibly they'll give you a free meal on next visit). I'm sure within a month or so the workers' service will be more efficient. Yeah the parking was difficult to find considering that Mervyns is closing and having a blowout sale during the holiday season  but the chaos should be expected. Wait till Mervyns closes  then parking will be no problem. I recommend this particular BJs location  but it should be noted that any BJs restaurants has great food. But try it for yourself and don't take my word for it.Bon appetit ^_^
Henry Y.,Mountain View  CA,12,137,3,12/13/2008,3.0,I think i would have been a great waiter/host staff here...too bad i applied too late...they are always awfully busy.we had a strange waitress tonight...i wasn't sure if she was being sarcastic  or demeaningmmm
Daniel M.,Daly City  CA,125,438,1,4/24/2009,2.0,"Came here tonight for a drink and a Pizookie. Strolled in with four friends around 9 pm. Packed. No seating available at the bar. Maybe b/c of the NHL & NBA Playoffs. We stood around for about 10-15 min before a table cleared out. The waiter we got was super friendly. We tried to order the Pumpkin Ale (which was on the menu and the light on at the tap)  but it wasn\'t available. We tried ordering another ""Seasonal"" that was on our menus  but that wasn\'t available as well. The waiter informed us of a third seasonal....but told us it was unavailable when we tried to order that. So...after about five minutes of trying to figure out what was available and what was not with the waiter  we settled on a pitcher of Heff....and three Pizookies. Beer and Pizookies...not a good combo. But that was our bad.Seasonal Beers on the menu  but not available....not a good look. Oh yeah  for those Rice Rocket drivers that want to check this place out  I suggest you take your other NON-lowered car here. The road to the parking lot of this place is terrible...and you will definitely scrape the bottom of your car. Just lookin\' out..."
Jessica E.,Oakland  CA,70,132,2,3/27/2010,5.0,So I went here last night on a d-a-t-e... I've heard so many good things about this place from my besticle so i was excited when my d-a-t-e said we were going there. This place was crackalackin lol The wait was an hour  but we didn't mind. It was friday with no reservations OF Course its a wait. BAM our buzzer goes off  we sit down  and here comes the waiter. So we got buffalo wings as the appetizer  & I ordered a caesar salad and a chilli stuffed baked potatoe. OMFG Their food is so delicious. I think I enjoyed the food more than my d-a-t-e. I'll be going back wait a minute did I forget to mention their Cream Soda? Yeah I did that was to die for!!!! They brew their own beer  cream soda  and root beer. If I wasn't laying off beer and alcohol for a few months I'd tell you how good their adult drinks were. Oh well. Me loves this place.
Ann L.,San Ramon  CA,31,92,20,3/8/2009,3.0,"So I\'ve been here a few times and I\'ll just say it\'s a-ok. Service can be ehhh and food is just ehhh as well. The fist time I came here  just shortly after they opened  I ordered their pot roast sandwich  which came out without mashed potatoes on it. So when I asked the waiter if that was a mistake  he was like  ""Oh this doesn\'t come with it..."" but as he finished the sentence  the cook came out with a freshly made plate with mashed potatoes on it and said ""I\'m sorry  I sent this out to you with no mashed potatoes."" Whoops. Also once we ordered the mozzarella sticks and the texture of it was downright off. Everyone there loves their bbq chicken pizza so we decided to try it once. The deep dish was a little too ""undone"" tasting and all you could taste on it was the bbq sauce. Their jambalaya is one of the better tasting meals I\'ve had. And lastly I\'ve had their California Grilled Chicken sandwich  which  well  lacked flavor as well. Hm. The ultimate does like their pizookies... they do have a great selection of beers  the bf likes their stouts and I like their seasonal pumpkin ale and their hefs. The wait here is a joke  but one good thing is that they do have ""call ahead"" seating. When you\'re on your way  give them a call to have your name put on the wait list. And the parking lot... wow  it needs to be repaved."
Lee T.,Newark  CA,4,14,7,8/29/2009,4.0,I went here for my birthday back in May.I ordered a rack of babyback ribs  a baked potato  and some other small items that I don't really remember. I do remember though that everything I ordered tasted great  minus the BBQ sauce that came with the ribs. But that's no big deal.The waiters/waitresses were very upbeat and interactive. I liked that.
Amie R.,Morgan Hill  CA,35,7,,10/2/2010,1.0,The food deserves 4 stars but the customer service receives 1 star. They are very slow. Call ahead only takes 20 minutes off your wait. Even if you call in 30 minutes ahead of time. If you want to go to a BJ's with good food and service  head to Cupertino
Juliana T.,Fremont  CA,156,473,46,1/2/2009,3.0,A good brewery and bar food restaurant right off the freeway. Nothing spectacular about them but if you want a yummy bite to eat  this one's the newest in Fremont. The ambiance is warm and fun but if you're looking for unusual or unique food  it's not here. This is your basic  pizza  burgers  nachos sort of joint.
Samuel M.,Fremont  CA,0,34,1,9/21/2012,3.0,"This is a decent place to grab a drink after work in the Tri-City. Not quite as good as some of the ""dive"" bars or breweries in Pleasanton  but they do have a good selection of beers on tap. Be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 mins to an hour for dinner after 7 PM."
Emily L.,Fremont  CA,1,8,,12/7/2013,4.0,The food was good as usual. The new smaller brewhouse burgers and mini pizza were a nice change from the giant portions I usually see. Perfect for lunch. We were seated quickly  but service was super slow once we sat down.
Paulo M.,Fremont  CA,2,11,,9/4/2010,4.0,Awesome beer. My favorite is a toss up between the nutty brewnette and the piranha  plenty of hops for your taste buds. Their happy hour is great as personal pizzas are half price.
Danielle O.,Union City  CA,106,171,118,1/18/2011,4.0,Love to come here with friends. They have a nice beer selection as well as food. The parking is kinda crappy. The waiting is a bit long but its only because its sooo pack. The food especially the PIZZOKIE is amazing.
Trish R.,Fremont  CA,0,20,,10/2/2013,4.0,Boyfriend and I come here all the time and I love it. Each time the service is up to par. Food is great (not anything fancy or really delicious though) and the pizookie is to die for. :) Well-priced menus.
notre d.,Fremont  CA,6,14,1,6/13/2009,4.0,Not bad for Newark/Fremont area and pretty crowded during dinner time  even during weekdays. Be prepared to be patient to get a seat for dinner.Their handcrafted brews are not bad - I really love the 7 glass sampler. A good way to try out their brews.I haven't really had a bad meal their yet. The pizzas are decent with my favorite so far the 2 chicken sandwiches.
Suhas J.,Fremont  CA,0,5,,10/1/2013,4.0,Probably the best place in Fremont to hangout with friends or family. They have a huge screen which makes watching games a delight. Beer is OK. Food is good. Service is consistent. Fills up fast on the weekends - wait times are between 45 minutes to 2 hours. Call ahead for shorter wait times.
Brendan J.,Los Angeles  CA,51,357,72,12/12/2008,3.0,The food is okay! The drinks overpriced for Fremont area. Nice place to have a birthday party though.
AP F.,Fremont  CA,0,3,,11/22/2011,4.0,Awesome deep dish pizza! Only thing to watch out -- they use to have over 4 toppings priced as 4. But now they changed it -- each topping $1.50. So when we ordered **all** veggies large pizza last time - they charged us some $38 for that pizza alone! Otherwise it should cost you about $25-28.pzookie is great  kids will love it. Their kid's meals are good for my kids  especially the side (salad) my kid gets is worth the kid's meal price by itself!
Paul C.,Fremont  CA,49,142,,4/18/2009,2.0,Came here in January 2009 a couple of months after this location was opened. The service was mediocre at best and really slow. We were there in the early evening (around 5pm) so it was not too crowded. Our server was really slow at getting drinks and bringing our food.When we were first seated  the booth was still dirty as there was a fork on the seat and a dirty napkin. Next  there was no silverware set on the table which we had to ask for. It took 10 minutes to get 2 beers and some water. An order for sliders took 40 minutes to get out and by that time  most of us were done eating. The server said he would come back to refill our drinks but never did so we had to ask another server. The only thing I can give them props on was dropping off the pizookie before the ice cream melted.Anyway  service here is terrible  so you're better off going to the BJ's in Cupertino. I've been there many times and the service is much better and faster if you don't mind the drive.
Lori D.,Fremont  CA,17,77,6,1/31/2009,5.0,*drool... Pizookie...*For a chain restaurant  this place is spot-on. There is quite a bit of variety on the menu  pretty delicious choices for beer  and... oh yes... it even pleased my ever-so-picky father!Despite the crowded parking lot  we got seated in less than 10 minutes. I have had their Great White deep dish pizza before at the Oakridge Mall location (and VERY impressed  best one around for miles (Pizza Chicago is the only one which exceeds)  so I convinced my father to get BJ''s Favorite. My mom got the Santa Fe salad. I got a California Grilled Chicken sandwich. To drink  I had a homemade Cream Soda (no corn syrup!) and wow  you can taste all the flavors to it. Pops got the Taster  which gives you 5oz. portions of each of their 7 beers. My favorite of their beers is the blonde  red  and brewnette (funny how my faves were the hair colored ones!).It's rare at times with my family but we all LOVED EVERYTHING! My sandwich was filling  flavorful  and oh so cheesy! And I liked how they have an option of the type of fries (wedges or crispy thin)  those wedges were tasty. I was even munching my mom's salad with her  since she was raving about it the whole time (she saw someone else having it at a table before we sat down  she asked what the lady ordered). And that pizza filled and satisfied my finicky father; plus he had leftovers for tomorrow's Super Bowl Sunday.Then last but not least  we HAD to get a Pizookie! All my friends from SoCal were raving about them to me so I had to give in. We shared this new one  double chocolate cookie in the tin with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream on top  with a Ghiradelli square as garnish. That was simply unforgettable... I highly recommend it to anyone and to even make room at the end of your meal for it (if you're a chocolate fan  like my family is).I have no complaints about the service  they seemed a bit busy at times  but that's because so many people were there!I'm so happy they built one in Newark near Newpark Mall (instead of a Friday's!) I'll definitely be going back and spreading the goodness to all my Fremont friends. I'd also like to try more of their specialty drinks sometime too.
Mike W.,Union City  CA,54,70,42,1/2/2009,2.0,Food good  but by my book  a brewery needs to be about the beer.The first time  I had their stout and a Marin IPA. Decent stuff. Wish they had a bigger selection but workable.The second time  my black and tan was a failure. That's a huge no-no in my book. The third time  it was a 45 minute wait at 8:30pm on a Fri night. Errr  pass.I'm a temperamental drinker. There's better  even in Fremont.
Elvira G.,Union City  CA,33,88,12,1/26/2011,4.0,All the food that I've had here is amazing. Some of the drinks are not that great but if you don't like it they'll let you try something else...the atmosphere is a lot of fun. I came here for the world series and it was a blast. Go here if you want to have a good time watching a good game. Or just want to go with good company... Ps. Try the pazooki...
Samantha C.,San Jose  CA,75,357,58,12/13/2010,4.0,I know i know  this is a pizza place  but I Love the sliders here! It's more fun to sit at the bar area as the crowd is so friendly.
reggie c.,Oakland  CA,177,52,2,2/25/2009,3.0,Meh wife and I went here on a Sunday Night when there was a football game on.  Place was packed to the gills with an hour wait  so we asked for a seat at the bar.  Food was pretty good.  I had a big plate of Jambalaya that had some good flavors going on shrimp wasn't rubbery and had lots of andoullie.  The IPA was decent  but nowhere near the old Brewpup on the Green.It's a sportsbar that has above average superbowl fare.
Felecia W.,Dublin  CA,2,51,5,7/5/2013,3.0,Nice place to come with a group. Very nicely decorated and lively atmosphere. Tv's everywhere. Food is good for a chain restaurant. Similar to like a cheesecake factory or such. Our group ordered the beer sampler and that was fun to sip their house special beers. The dessert was memorable. Giant cookie topped with ice cream and beignets. The meal itself was just regular stuff that I forgot exactly  since I was their over 1 mth ago.
Christian F.,Philadelphia  PA,60,29,7,2/2/2010,4.0,BJ's was one of the first breweries that I went to and it's always had a special place in my beer heart. The beers are fantastic  all of them. From the hefeweizens to the stouts. The artichoke heart dip is great along with the wings. The deep dish pizza has almost been a tradition for me and my friends. Lastly there's the famous pizookie. That combination of hot and cold in a single bite is something that needs to be experienced. The service is great. On the few times that there has been a problem  the server was always quick to address it (always resulting in our benefit). It can get pretty crazy busy at times and there can be long waits and you might have to wait a bit for your food  but it's generally within the limits of being understandable considering how busy it gets. Come here with friends for a good time and be sure to try the pizookie!
Ace W.,South San Francisco  CA,12,1,1,7/1/2011,3.0,Service is okay. But the red velvet pizookie is a must try. Be careful  floors in the bar area are pretty slippery.
Kristine A.,Monte Sereno  CA,273,404,97,1/2/2011,5.0,"Perfect for muchies!!! I live nearby and I always  ALWAYS  call in and order the spicy avocado rolls  calamari (sometimes it is so-so  but still a must  with the 2 ranches and 1 marinara)  clam chowder in bowls  and the half oreo-half cc cookies w/oreo whipped cream and ice cream and in less than 15 minutes it\'s ready for pickup. Eaten in the restaurant a couple times... prefer to toke and choke in the comfort of my own home though :) minus all the people that flock here... every single night. Its what fills up the parking spaces of the old staples/petsmart/kidsrus (now demolished) slash old rasputin  home furnishings  circuit city  dollar tree  and the abandoned mervyn\'s spaces. Good business. In the same ""plaza"" there\'s a 76 with really nice clerks  open 24hrs. We order here very often!"
Eddy G.,Union City  CA,88,20,6,6/20/2011,4.0,Good Food   tasty beers great service.. Only complaint is the guest. Alot of fake sports fans and young first time binge drinkers . You know the people that scream and yell for a certain team  but have no clue who and what any of the players names and the young college students that spend all their money on beer  but not enough to tip. Yeah those kind of people. Other than that. Its a great place to hangout with your friends and co-workers   when its not super busy!! 4stars
Heni K.,Fremont  CA,0,1,,10/2/2011,5.0,Love to start with in house margarita & beer with food.. long waiting every time i go but worth it though!!!
Peggy T.,Glendale  AZ,2,12,1,8/2/2011,4.0,We were promptly seated. I ordered a Caesar salad and tomato soup. They didn't freak out when I asked for Steak on my Caesar salad but in fact asked how I would like the steak cooked! I asked for nothing to be put into the tomato soup. Most places and even other BJ's seem to struggle with that request and still put croutons parsley and cheese into it. They nailed it! Crouton parsley and cheese free! My husband ate Jambalaya  a little too spicy for my palate but he paired it with their Nitwit white wheat beer. He loved it. We were in and out of there in no time. This was a very enjoyable meal. The place had people lined out the door when we were leaving so it obviously has a draw.
Miko T.,Fremont  CA,17,59,1,1/2/2009,4.0,Tonight I visited the Newark BJ's for the first time. My prior experience was at the location in San Mateo (I think?)  but it was for a large group  and all of the pizzas were pre-ordered  so my involvement was very limited. This Newark location visit was mainly a good one. My boyfriend's parents actually got there before we (the boyfriend and I) did. They got there at 5:45 and were told that it was going to be a 30-35 minute wait. We arrived at 6:05 and they had just been seated  so the wait was less than expected  especially for a Friday night. After getting seated and receiving waters all around  we ordered the BJ's Best (?)  general appetizer plate. It had cheese sticks  avacado egg rolls  santa fe rolls (didn't try this)  and spinach-artichoke dip. The spinach-artichoke dip was amazing and nice and warm  and served with tortilla chips. Cheese sticks were standard  and the avacado egg rolls were fine. The main negative here was that it took a long time for drinks other than water and fountain soda to be brought to the table. It was like waiting for food  but it was just a drink. I mean  how long can it take  really? I ordered fish and chips  with skinny fries. It was good  fresh  though the fries were not hot. In fact  they were a little too close to bla-room temperature. But the fish was definitely just out of the fryer. Boyfriend ordered pizza. The medium was pretty large  definitely a lot for just one person. He ate half of it  and took the rest home for leftovers. He ordered the BJ's favorite pizza (looked good). Salads that can be ordered with a meal are an additional $2.95. Be aware though  that as a side salad is pretty big. Probably served on a plate about 6 inches in diameter. I would skip on a side salad if you plan on ordering dessert. For dessert we ordered a pazookie  I think the oreo one. The oreo part of it was this little cream on top  otherwise it was a chocolate cookie. So I had heard a lot of hype about this pazookie thing  and understood it as just a cookie with ice cream. However  the cookie is almost like a brownie  fresh out of the oven  and still has that doughy texture. Combined with the ice cream  it's way more than just a cookie  and DEFINITELY worth getting. So skip on salad and little extras  and save room for dessert.Other little tid bits...the noise in this place is pretty intense  and it's probably not the best place for nice quiet  intimate conversation. Another slight negative is that there are servers and then waiters for each table  so it's a bit confusing trying to get something. Because you can't ask the person who brings the beer for another drink--you'd have to ask your server for that. I just don't think that system is the most effective or convenient for either the guests or the employees.Prices are moderately fair  and the menu is extensive. Choices range from salads  potatoes  soup  sandwiches  burgers  pizza  pasta  and more. Reservations are only accepted for groups of ten or more  and from what I've heard  the wait can be quite long  depending on when you go. I think we just got lucky tonight.Overall  good place. Would go again. Skip salad/sides/appetizers. Save room for dessert. :)
Derya A.,Oakland  CA,208,243,141,2/1/2011,4.0,I love the food and desserts here. Everything I've ordered  from the Cajun pasta  pizzas have been great. The Pizookies are amazing and are a must-have. I say only four stars because the wait is always super long. Sometimes they estimate it to be way longer than it is (ie. 40 minutes instead of 10 minutes) which I guess is better than it being longer than what the wait really is but it's just annoying.
Brian F.,San Jose  CA,334,165,1,12/10/2010,4.0,I think everyone know what to expect when going to BJs  large portions and a large menu. Its not as large of a menu as Cheesecake Factory  but its large enough. Service was good and the place was clean as expected.
Alex V.,Mountain View  CA,17,48,6,8/14/2011,3.0,I went on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was pretty calm. As far as the food I think it's average but not anything out of this world. The service was okay. It's a great place to go with a group since the seating is conducive to groups with a bar. It was a challenge for me because 'm a vegetarian and I don't drink alcohol.
Julia G.,Vancouver  Canada,0,18,,6/14/2011,2.0,We were passing through and wanted to watch the Stanley Cup. BJ's was suggested as a sports bar we could go to. What is it about BJ's that makes people line up for 40 minutes? The food was very Cheesecake Factory - huge portions and huge calories. My chicken fresca salad was OK. The grilled chicken had a powdery texture on the outside. Not enough arugula and the vegetables were barely cooked. It came after 45minutes. What were they doing? I think they do their pizza best but the portions are so huge it's impossible to order. The American burger came with toast instead of a bun.??? I guess there's just nothing else in Fremont. So we ate a so so meal in a PACKED restaurant and watched our team lose. Oh  the service is excellent though.
Cee B.,San Jose  CA,1,75,3,8/6/2011,2.0,The BJ's in Cupertino  which is the ORIGINAL BJ's is by far BETTER than this one. The food and service is better at BJ's in CUPERTINO. I've had lunch at BJ's in Newark/Fremont twice and they also catered a lunch for my company  which was not very good. The pizza's were just not that good and the pasta's were extremely skimpy in the pasta trays. We all thought it was kind of crappy to be honest. I've been to the BJ's in Cupertino countless times and NEVER been disappointed. I've also been to the BJ's in San Jose on Blossom Hill  which I should probably do a separate review on. Terrible experience LOL#teamBJ'sCupertino
Erik D.,Hayward  CA,165,21,11,10/12/2010,5.0,Gotta try their seasonal beers!
Jason C.,Hayward  CA,61,28,,9/5/2011,4.0,It's probably my first time going into this BJ restaurant  but I gotta say  I like their decor here. My friends and I went here around 11 pm for a late night snack. The place was still pretty packed! We mainly ordered desserts here. I LOVE their cookies n' cream pizookie. Hell  I like anything with cookies n' cream  at least for desserts haha. Left a 25% tip because that's how I roll! lol jk  it's cause I was craving for sweets that night.
Roxanne W.,Newark  CA,22,3,,7/16/2013,1.0,Beware! BJ's claim their gift cards expire even though there is no visible expiration date on the card  only when they scan it :-(
Stanley C.,San Jose  CA,776,641,2569,9/18/2010,4.0,BJ'S RESTAURANT & BREWHOUSEIt's always a great experience at BJ's - friendly staff  large menu  sports TVs  and an all-around friendly/fun atmosphere. It is one of the better sports bar restaurants around. Their deep-dish pizza is pretty good  and is big enough to feed an army. Lots of choices of home-brewed beer  and best of all  the infamous Pizookie - ice cream over a large 6-inch baked cookie (chocolate chip  oreo  macadamia nut  etc.) The best deal at BJ's is the 2 for $20 value meal that they offer: 1 Medium Pizza (we got half Southwestern and half Sweet Pig aka Hawaiian)  2 small salads which were huge  and 1 Pizookie of our choice! Tastes great and good for the money!!! BJ's is a great place for large dinner groups  although the wait can be quite long. Come early to get faster seating  although you can sit at the bar on a first-come-first setting. Great appetizers also! Can't wait to go back and watch some sports!
Tina N.,Union City  CA,165,69,14,11/21/2008,4.0,I've been to other BJ restaurants around the bay; and I loved them all.Now going to one closer to home  will make it more pleasurable and easy to watch sports and have a drink or two. There are screens everywhere  great for Sunday afternoons or Monday nights. The food is amazing  I love their Together At Last (spinach dip/bruchetta mix) appetizer and I am a big fan of their Pizookie dessert! The Calm Chowder is also full of flavor and has a ton of baby clams. Our waitress was new  but I mean they just opened up so I don't blame her for being a little rough on the edges.I am definitely going to be a returning customer.
Michelle L.,Fremont  CA,0,5,,6/14/2011,1.0,I have been to BJ's numerous times and have always had a pleasant experience  but this time I called ahead to put my name on the waiting list. They said it would be 20-25 minute wait and by the time I got there we would have a table. We have a 3 month old and this would be perfect. We arrived there in 22 minutes and went up to tell them we had called ahead. The guy behind the counter handed us a pager and said it would be another 20 minutes. I said we called ahead and put our name down and he said yeah well its still going to be a wait. What is the point in calling ahead then? With having the baby we decided to go somewhere else that we could get in then. I'm sorry but the food is great but this place really sucks. If I want BJ's I will visit another location.
Hans R.,Wakefield  MA,0,54,,6/13/2011,4.0,The help was very friendly  manager stopped by to make sure we were happy and the food was good. Just as important in a brewhouse  the beer was good too. Look forward to going back when I'm in town
Shawn C.,Great Falls  MT,4,60,,10/13/2009,3.0,The first time I visited this location it was horrible.The second time  it was not quite as bad.The third time  Bartender Melissa made it all better with quick and perfect service. Subsequently  the service has improved with each visit.Keep the service quality up  and this place will shine. The Beer and food are fine... just keep the service level high. If this place had a brewery on site-- I'd probably rate it a 5 .
Tyler P.,San Diego  CA,5,17,1,1/31/2009,2.0,I hate-love BJ'S. Some of the food is hella good  in a deep fried greasy way. And some of their food is complete and total crap. My biggest complaint with BJ's would have to be their service. Every time I go there I have to ask them to remake the food because it is usually at room temperature or cold. The waiters and waitress seem to be oblivious to what is going on around them or what procedures are when that happens. The appetizers are all pretty good. And they have a 7 beer drink sampler for 10.00 bucks. .. . Which was pretty sweet. Anyways I still end up coming back because they stay open late and they are really close. . . . .
Irfan R.,San Jose  CA,369,515,34,1/14/2010,4.0,Been here a couple times and the pizza and pasta is very good. Also have a lot of TV screens all over the place so you can watch different sporting events. Good place for groups and parties.
Kalvin C.,San Leandro  CA,69,238,11,1/6/2010,5.0,I went here with fellow yelper Jowin C. and I have to agree that their deep dish pizza  (The BJ's favorite) is to die for. Their root beer is pretty good too  not to mention they are pretty prompt on the refills so you can keep on chuggin' . It may be a little pricey  but hey theres parking and the foods awesome so its worth the extra couple of dollars here and there.
Raymond C.,Fremont  CA,10,23,3,11/21/2010,4.0,Not bad for a chain which is saying a lot. A lot of chain restaurants have gone downhill and is not a reliable gauge of consistency any more. They have an extensive menu so you will find something to you like.
Tim W.,San Francisco  CA,39,121,39,9/29/2010,2.0,Meh  I've experience better. The place is well decorated went there for the after hours special drinks. We had couple of beers and mini pizza for half off. I requested to get some waters and that never came. Service took a while. I guess it maybe the server we had  poor service!
Lisa B.,Fremont  CA,94,2,,4/28/2013,2.0,Good food  horrible sercive. Every time I have eaten here the service has been really bad. We went for my man's birthday and it was just the two of us. We were seated at the table and sat there for 15 minutes before someone finally came and asked us if we had been greeted yet. We were so hungry otherwise we would have left and gone somewhere else. My man ordered a beer that never came. I had to go up to the bar and order one myself. Our appetizer came out after his meal and my meal came out 10 minutes later. Bottom line...the food is pretty good but the service needs a lot of improvement.
DANNY B.,San Francisco  CA,2,60,15,1/11/2010,5.0,I went to this place with the impression that the food was great and to my surprise ----IT WAS... I ate the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich and I have to say it was one of the best sandwiches i have ever eaten.. A week later I went to the BJ'S in Concord and i ate the same thing and to my surprise it was the worse sandwich ever so i guess I will stick to the one in Newark.
Janet E.,Portland  ME,2,16,,2/17/2009,5.0,I've only been here once  but I loved it! It's just my kind of food. The atmosphere is great  the service was good (I was smart: I went on a week night).There is also a massive television that can be seen from almost all tables in the restaurant  my boyfriend wanted me to mention that.We will definitely be returning.
beck l.,Fremont  CA,0,173,4,8/7/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I'm sorry but I had to down grade by 1 star. Two reasons: 1) The food can be a bit fattening. Lots of extra butter here and there to make the food taste better. Watch out for those extra calories. 2) Not because of any fault of the restaurant  but this place is just too busy. Too many people make me feel nervous.
Jamie W.,San Leandro  CA,1,11,,4/1/2010,2.0,"...Interesting decor  if you have ADD this is the place for you. There are multiple tv\'s on every wall of this place and and they\'re all slightly delayed from each other by a second or two so there\'s distracting flashing screens everywhere. Service was alright. My dad ordered a hefeweizen and it didn\'t come with a lemon :( and it took her a couple of times before she came back to bring it to us. Food: I saw the pictures for the deep dish pizzas in a couple of places and thought it looked tasty enough  so I ordered a mini original one. I was pretty disappointed with it however. It wasn\'t a deep dish pizza so much as it was a personal pan pizza with just a REALLY thick bottom crust. And the bottom crust was pretty greasy  not really appetizing. So I had half of the pizza and switched with my dad for half of his burger. He ordered it medium rare....and it was definitely more rare than medium. I swear parts still might have been moving. I had it anyways  and it was alright  nothing really special about it except for it was really thin. Came with the option of potato wedges or thin cut fries  definite plus there  I LOVE thin cut fries :) So we did decide to go for the dessert and got the triple pizookie deal. I still have a bit of a problem with the name ""pizookie"" it sounds like ""pizz"" and ""dookie"" put together. :/ However I\'m not one to turn away anything with a scoop of ice cream on top. We got the cookie\'s and cream  white chocolate mac  and chocolate chunk. They were okay.... nothing really wowed me. They looked and tasted like they were baked by a light bulb a-la easy bake oven. Good to go I guess if you have a large party  wide selection of beer and you can be as loud as you want. Not someplace I would crave."
Spencer H.,Milpitas  CA,377,222,,5/19/2010,4.0,I have had several trips here and each time was a great experience. Give the beer sampler a try. You can do a variety of the beers they have available. Their burgers are delicious and I recommend you ending the meal with their pazookie(giant cookie with ice cream on top) It is so mouth watering. By the way  if you come here for your birthday  you get a free pazookie!
Dee L.,Fremont  CA,0,34,19,11/29/2010,3.0,Typical American bar-grill food and tasty beer. Good place to get a drink with friends. Also  they have Pizookis (giant freshly-baked cookie and ice cream) of ALL flavors.
Stevie O.,Fremont  CA,0,4,,1/23/2011,3.0,Went to BJ's with friends after a show. Had the grilled chicken pasta and the chicken was overcooked and dry  but the baked beignet was pretty good. The waitress was fairly attentive. Stays open later than most restaurants which is nice.
Tammy G.,Hayward  CA,20,21,3,9/30/2010,5.0,I went here for my bday a couple years ago!! The food was soooo good!! The drinks were great too! it was a great experience!!! Been trying to go back since but haven't had a chance!!! I give this place a 5 all the way!! Just a super fun atmosphere!!!
Jennifer n.,San Jose  CA,259,154,234,5/5/2009,2.0,"You know I am a fan of BJ\'s pan pizza but the overall experience this time was just disturbing. The wait was only 10 minutes so not too bad but what bugged me was the service. It SUCKED and so was my company that came with me.After 2 hours of in-door rock climbing  I decided to join some climbers that I knew to BJ\'s. The waitress greeted us with a smile which started off nice and took our drink and our appetizer order. As soon as she left another waitress came by to take our order stating it was her section. Long story short  she walked away not happy. (Shoot! If I knew any better she was not happy for me!)When the pitcher of beer arrived we tasted it and asked for lemon and to my surprise got a remark ""That is not how you drink this beer  it is made sweet."" My Asian eyes were as big as my caucasian friends! I turned towards her  smiled and said in a firm voice ""This beer is too sweet and we would like some lemon please"". Waiting.....waiting.....waiting....tick tock....waiting....UGH!. I went to the bar and got a cup of lemons for the table. When the waitress came back with our appetizer  she noticed the lemon and commented with a smile  ""I like the beer the way it is"". UH HELLO PSYCHO! You are suppose to say sorry for not bringing the lemons and who cares what you like. We are the paying customers!"" 1...2....3...4...ok....calm now....on with the review....Our avocado egg rolls were not too bad but it would have been nice to have silver wear or at least napkins. My company was starving so they both ate it without a care. Our pizza came out w/o the pizza server  we still did not have plates and had to request for them. Sorry fokes but I tip accordingly and these guys that I was with  staring at her hooters thought she was the sweetest waitress there was and EVEN complimented her in the end. I hate tipping 30% for shiety arse service! I was so sick I wanted to barf! I was not in the mood to argue w/ these fools so I split the check in 3  paid for my portion and went home.I wish there was a way to review these two guys! They would of gotten minus stars from me! And they want to hang out again...Uh a big NO THANKS!Ok...going to sleep now. I will be happy once again when I wake up. :D Tomorrow is a new day!"
Jonathan K.,San Jose  CA,241,248,80,6/10/2009,2.0,"food 3 stars (will not go into detail here)  online ordering:1 star.simply put: DO NOT ORDER ONLINE!!!!!! not only is the online ordering system weird (see twitter.com/jonk/status/ ) but it really does go downhill from there. keep reading for a BJ\'s blow-by-blow. (ha!)i place an order and it says show up 30 minutes later. i show up. she goes over the order and OOPS she didn\'t enter an item. meaning i have to wait 15 minutes more while they whip it up (a flatbread pizza). lesson learned: online ordering doesn\'t actually put in an order -- they have to re-type it into their computer systems.turns out at the end we weren\'t waiting for this flatbread pizza but the lettuce wraps (which were correctly ordered the first time).and then she brings out the food  all done.at which point i notice shrimp on the lettuce wraps. the bf does not eat seafood.me: ""uhh  what is this?""her: ""it\'s the thai shrimp lettuce wraps""me: ""umm  we ordered chicken lettuce wraps"" (reading it directly off my receipt)her: ""uhh  we don\'t have chicken  just thai shrimp""she pulls out a menu and points to it.i point to the item directly above.another 15 minute wait while they rush out the chicken wraps.i was offered a sundae for my troubles but turned it down because the bf is lactose intolerant. i suggest maybe a pizookie cookie without ice cream  but she goes in and checks and the manager denies her. (and yet somehow she can offer a full-on sundae?).our consolation prize? two cups of strawberry lemonade.gee thanks.on the upside  i now have thai shrimp lettuce wraps for tomorrow\'s lunch."
Gus R.,Fremont  CA,0,16,1,12/31/2011,1.0,We have been here many times and have notice the service level has been dropping as time goes by. The first few times we were here it was great  good food nice atmosphere and friendly people. I always tip at least 20% so I usually get good service from repeat servers. I don't mind waiting a few minutes and neither does my family so I understand that it's a busy place. On the second to last night we came here we ordered the same as usual. Each person in my family has a different favorite dish. The dishes came out differently and were lacking some ingredients as if they were trying to cut back and make the dish more profitable. I understand that given the demand of the place and I asked if they were kind enough to include what was in the dishes before and that I knew that I would have to pay more and didn't mind paying more. The server kept trying to explain to me that it wasn't included anymore and I understood that the first second. I kept trying to express that I didn't care that it would cost me more. Next thing I know I have the manager in front of me with a bad attitude explaining that it wasn't included and that if I must have it they could give it to me to make me happy......!!!!. I tried to stay calm and told them that it wasn't necessary and that we didn't need to have it. I still tipped well and try to not let it get to me. I am a small business owner and I understand that owners don't necessarily control what their managers and employees do so I gave the place another chance. When we got there the server from last time said something to the server we got this time and all of a sudden we were all getting carded for buying a bottle of wine. Never happened before. At that moment I knew that I wasn't welcomed and asked to talk to the manager this time. The guy just laughed at me and said that if I wanted wine I had to be carded. I said  thank you very much but I would rather go somewhere I can relax to have a nice dinner. I know that Fremont is well known for bad restaurants but this place is the worst for me so far. I had some great nights here before but they have taken their hospitality quality to a new low. I understand that owners don't care much as long as the place is making money but this guys are just plane rude. I would avoid this place at all costs if you are trying to have a good relaxing time.
Danny R.,Fremont  CA,3,39,,6/1/2009,2.0,"The food is good but the service blows. I\'ve been to the fremont location about 10 or so times and while nobody has ever been out right rude to me  however the staff is very inattentive. The main thing that I notice every time i go here is that I have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes before I\'m seated  then i\'m seated around empty tables? If there are so many empty tables  why did I have to wait half an hour? I dont know what the logic or methodology with their seating approach but it sucks. Luckily they have good beer on tap to mellow me out and stop me from asking ""why the hell was I waiting for 20 minutes?"" over and over. This seating scenario has happened to me on 3 different occasions  i dont get it? ALSO; the menu\'s are always sticky. WTF? who hands out sticky menu\'s? How about instead of having the host/hostess up front staring at the wall you have him/her sponge down some menu\'s? sheezzz. Now once you get passed the crappy seating  the disinterested staff  and the sticky cola coated menu\'s; the food is good eats! The chili burger is slammin and the shoe string fries are a must have. I\'ve gotten the Cobb salad here once before and it was HUGE! So if your feeling brave enough to drudge through the lame staff for a good burger and beer  BJ\'s is worth it."
David H.,Fremont  CA,7,178,2,6/9/2010,2.0,BJ's get's two stars only because they did a nice job with the decor. Otherwise this place is kind of the pits. A hour wait is standard and the food is mediocre at best (bland is the best decription... and I'm talking about blackened chicken breast). They do have a nice selection of home brews and extensive list of Belgian ales that actually impressed me. If you're not with a big group I'd recommend trying to catch a perch at the bar where the turnover seems quicker. Overall I think this place is best avoided  and instead explore the riches of the many food offerings of the area (particularly from Southern and Southeast Asian). Why waste your life on boring food?
soodteen j.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,2/12/2009,4.0,New!!! place I like it. Good Food and Good Dessert Also I like Strawberry Lemonate Yummy =) but just a little bit slow for service. I think may be I get there too late at night around 10pm.
Sean C.,Campbell  CA,0,3,,12/17/2011,1.0,"I have been to other BJ\'s locations and have always enjoyed myself. However last night we waited 3 hours for a table. After being told repeatedly we were next other groups were continually sat before us. When we finally found a booth in the bar someone pushed past us to sit  the managers only response to this is that the booth was ""first come first serve"". Needless to say we left and will never be returning again."
Phillip T.,Pacheco  CA,77,19,,10/28/2009,4.0,Great place. Good Food. Sometimes service is very fast and sometimes it takes forever to get your food. However  the place rocks!
Jennifer G.,Kansas City  MO,2,12,6,1/31/2011,4.0,Every time I've eaten at BJ's the food has been either good or great. I've had the deep dish pizza  shrimp pasta  burger  and the pizookie. The only dish I had that wasn't great  was the shrimp pasta because the noodles tasted too much like lemon and it was overwhelming...so it was good but not great.If you like sports and beer  this is the place for you. I'm not into either one  but I know a lot of people are. They always have at least 2 different games on the big screen tvs  and they have tons of beer options. They also make their own root beer  but I haven't tried it yet.The reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the wait time to be seated we experienced the last time we were there. They do have call ahead seating  and we did call ahead. So we called ahead  and then drove over and checked in at the desk and they said it would be about 20 minutes more. That would have been ok  but it ended up being about 45 minutes later that we were finally seated. They did at least pass out pizza appetizers to those of us waiting to be seated  so at least they were trying to make up for the extremly long wait.
Jessika W.,San Jose  CA,52,13,6,11/24/2009,3.0,I love Bj's restaurant. But be CAREFUL!!!!.... There is a shady hotel right behind the location. We had out car broken into. Doors were locked  alarm set. Couldn't hear it from inside the restaurant. They stole company laptops. Restaurant experience is fine but I don't know that I could trust my car there again.
Brian E.,Newark  CA,0,3,,12/5/2011,1.0,This place is terrible. We had reservations for a large group  with confirmation faxes and emails  but when we got there they had no idea we were coming. Nothing was set up  no food and awful customer service. The Manager acted like we were inconveniencing him.  Once we showed him the paper work he didn't even apologize. He and the staff started throwing food at us as fast as possible and wouldn't even honor the endless buffet they had agreed to. After all this the manager didn't even bother to give us a discount or any sort of complementary entree or beverage. I don't recommend any body go here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sarah S.,Union City  CA,0,12,,1/28/2011,4.0,I love going to this place with my coworkers and love their signature cocktails. There is wait but it's a good hang out place for friends  family and kids. Their appetizers and platters are enough for 6 people ... it's affordable and a nice place to hang out... if you have more than 10 people and want to go out in dinner time than make sure you call in the noon time to make reservation .. and talk to the mangaer - he or she'll help you out to reserve your seats.
Connie B.,Union City  CA,72,6,,11/24/2012,1.0,Went with co-workers about 11 of us. We were one of the first to be there but those that came in after us were served before us. Their computer system went down and it took forever to get our orders. Half the table was done eating before the rest of us got our food. Horrible! Service was spotty and not very good. Asked for water  never got it. My chicken fettuccine was not cooked all the way and was dry and not good at all. When I told the waitress she didn't even ask if I wanted something else  oh so sorry was all I got. Won't be going there again and I suggest u don't either...don't waste your money!
Amanda S.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,1/20/2013,1.0,"I am frequently going to this restaurant and last night I was very surprised at the customer service I received. I had left my debit card there and called the restaurant to see if they had it. I was told to call back at 9 pm to talk with a manager several times and they would not let me speak with anyone else. I then got in my car and drove back to the restaurant to see if they had my card. When I got there I asked to speak with a manager and expressed my frustration with the host. The manager did not apologize and just told me that the situation was ""weird"". I am very unimpressed with how I was treated and will NEVER come back to this establishment. This restaurant needs to hire some new employees that actually care about their customers."
Glenda B.,Hayward  CA,0,10,1,9/19/2010,2.0,Came in on a Saturday night around 10ish. It wasn't completely busy  but it wasn't slow either. Impressive selection of beers not only on tap but also the bottled-Belgian kind YUM! Ordered the Oktoberfest and my friend ordered a Chimay red  as well as an appetizer. Service was prompt  and the wait staff was friendly. The wait staff came by several times to check if we wanted anything else....then several more times after that.....and then several more times after that. My friend and I got the hint...it was time to move along. I wasn't sure what to make of the whole experience. It was a little annoying getting interrupted every 10 minutes mid conversation. My friend felt that we were being rushed out of our seats for other customers  but I guess one could take it as them being attentive (even though a little too attentive). Rating should be 2 1/2 stars. Food & Drinks are great  atmosphere--not so much.
Tammy R.,Milpitas  CA,0,9,,11/13/2012,1.0,"Horrible horrible customer service. Management needs to change. Reservation at 7:30  were not seated till 8:15  managers reason was that our tables were given to other parties ""on accident."" What\'s the point of making a reservation if you ask me! Oh  and a person from my party did not recieve their food until after EVERYONE was already finished eating. Very dissatisfied with our visit  and trust me  we will not be visiting this BJ\'s anytime soon. I do not recommend this BJ\'s to anyone."
Insatiable Palate M.,Oakland  CA,2,71,43,6/3/2012,1.0,This BJ`s was just way too crowded on Friday night 6-1-12. We called ahead but did not experience the benefits. We waited almost 2 hours with 2 disabled adults  1 special needs child and 2 small children who eventually fell asleep  it was quite an adventure. So we do get seated and after asking repeatedly for a happy hour menu and saying if we wanted to order happy hour at the bar we could go over individually and order our drinks. WE THEN FIND OUT THERE IS NO HAPPY HOUR ON FRIDAY NIGHTS! My husband orders the cheeseburger pizza as he usually does and when it gets to our table we are disappointed.... where are the toppings? Usually this large pizza is chalked full of toppings. We ate  got a free appetizer to split among the 8 of us and left $140.00 later with an added 17% gratuity of course. Just not a good night at BJ`s! We will back back during the week for lunch when the food and service is much much better.
Rox M.,San Lorenzo  CA,27,325,37,6/30/2009,4.0,Despite having to wait for a table (ended up being a booth for a party of two  wtf??)  even later in the evening  the chicken pizza was surprisingly deeelicious!! The service was good & aside from the wait  it was actually pleasant to eat at BJ's. Drinks were on the house this time around....

Simone F.,Oakland  CA,227,129,1511,6/10/2011,4.0,"since i lived in fremont for a while a long time ago and met most of my old time friends from there  it made me ""home sick"" for a bit when sitting at the bar waiting for an old time friend for a pre-dinner drink and snack. great selections of beer and lots of food to choose from. i dont have a lot of comments on the food since we only ordered the moz sticks for snacks but it was good for what it is. will go back for more beer and trying some other food items from the menu."
W B.,Fremont  CA,3,62,2,5/19/2010,3.0,Food OK. Service OK. Beer excellent selection. Prices good. -2 stars because it is always crowded.
Rudy M.,Fremont  CA,109,6,,3/30/2009,3.0,The service here was great. The staff was very attentive and helpful in making selections. The food arrived in a timely manner and the staff always checked with us to see if we needed anything. Unfortunately  I hated what I ordered. I ordered the Cheeseburger Pizza. I wanted to try something new and I should have known better because it sucked. As a pizza it was horrible and as a burger it was bland. Either do a great pizza or a do a great burger but never try to do both at the same time. Avoid this pizza at all cost.
Deirdre P.,Boston  MA,1,65,,8/22/2010,4.0,BJ's Restaurant has a good selection of food  great drinks and good TVs for game watching. This is a great place for large groups to meet up.
Kira S.,Union City  CA,24,16,,6/21/2012,1.0,"The service here is HORRIBLE. They must only hire apathetic absentminded people. Every time I\'ve been here  I\'ve had a different waiter/waitress  and I can\'t think of a single nice thing to say about any of them. There is ALWAYS at least one order messed up at our table  which is amazing since they don\'t even involve any substitutions - which means they just don\'t know how to prepare the stuff on their menu?? And the waiter/waitress has never cared - ""oh you didn\'t order this? are you sure?"" SERIOUSLY? We\'ve had our entrees come out before the salads - we actually had to remind the waiter TWICE about our missing salads - first when he brought the entrees  and again while we were ordering dessert - didn\'t see him at all between that  we ended up walking up to the bar to replenish our drinks. I\'ve been brought pizookies with cold cookies and half melted ice cream multiple times  and one night our check came with charges for things we didn\'t even order! Last night  we ordered drinks that the waiter had to come back and confirm THREE times - what the heck were you writing down?? I don\'t know why I have continued to give this place so many chances. After last night  I probably won\'t again. There are plenty of places that have better food  and I will just bake my own ""pizookie"" the next time I feel like having one. It\'s just not worth all the hassle of trying to flag down someone to fix things that shouldn\'t even be messed up."
Michele M.,Hayward  CA,21,43,3,8/18/2011,4.0,I have always enjoyed the food and service at BJ's. Everything we have tried has been delicious and fresh and very filling. Recently  we signed up for a fundraising night to promote our 3rd Pancreatic Cancer walk in Fremont  and had a lot of trouble having them fulfill their end. The date we had secured came and went and we had to end up rescheduling. My family and I decided to visit last Sat to get it all straightened out and we met with Tom Aragon  the general manager. Very nice gentleman. He apologized for the confusion and assured us he will ensure it is all fulfilled this time. We had lunch as well and they took great care of us. I should note that last year they did not have the fundraiser program but had donated a gift card for our raffle and we were very touched by their generosity as most of the places we asked did not even give us the consideration of a phone call saying no thank you. Overall  I am impressed by their concern and willingness to participate in community events. In this day and age  it speaks volumes about a company to care enough to support the people in their communities. They have earned a soft spot in my heart and I will advocate for them going forward. Thanks BJ's!!!
Daniel W.,Hayward  CA,0,17,,11/23/2010,4.0,Certainly a kids hang out. If you are not up for dining with teenagers and college students this this isn't the place for you. Once you get past that though I found the food to be pretty good and the beers to be simply awesome. Service is good. I never had an inexperienced server and always plenty of parking.
Colin P.,San Francisco  CA,27,597,42,11/8/2010,3.0,Food was good. Took awhile to be seated for a Saturday night. Food service a bit slow. But manager was very accommodating.
California R.,San Jose  CA,37,155,,4/8/2010,3.0,I ordered take out but the food here was good. I ordered the ribs and chicken combo and man it was worth it. I mean my boss did offer lunch to hey  good hard or home right? The plate that came in was huge and filled with bbq sauce the way I like it. Id go back for take out again.
Allie H.,Castro Valley  CA,3,14,1,7/11/2012,5.0,LOVE this place. They have gluten free pizza AND gf pazookie! The service is friendly and quick. We've been several times and our servers have always been courteous and attentive. The food has never disappointed in quality or quantity!
Degustator J.,Newark  CA,4,70,68,2/23/2009,4.0,"One of those wickedly spacious  almost ""too popular"" for its own good places - sometimes wait is over an hour - not because they are that busy  but because their staff is a little on the slow side. Food is pretty awesome  reasonably priced  well made and of good variety. Beer is drinkable - standard middle of the road micro brew variety. Kids food is cheap and portions are large. Huge TV screens everywhere  great place to catch a game with buddies if you arent trying to actually hear the game and rather focus more on the friends  the appetizers (wings) and brews. Loud nostalgic tunes from the 80s - yay! Much better deal than the Red Robins across the street - definitely kicking their ass."
Kim R.,San Francisco  CA,548,284,37,12/8/2009,3.0,The food here is either a hit or a miss depending on what you order. I had the chicken sandwich here  it wasn't the greatest. I use to like the pizza here  but its gone downhill on taste its very doughy  thick and not enough cheese & sauce. Their pastas on the other hand is pretty good so far. The margarita I ordered was really strong here  not like TGIF where they skim on the alcohol and pour mostly sweet&sour. I've ordered this one drink twice on different days and they were completely different in taste  not good. Consistency is very important especially if you want the customer to order it again. It's opened late and serves all sorts of beer. Parking is typically easy to find.
Andy M.,San Ramon  CA,0,8,,5/27/2011,1.0,Extremely disappointed with staff attitude and service. Big NO although I am BJ's fan. I'd stick to elephant bar or some other joints. I almost see arrogance in every staff member including manager which is weird.
Lynn C.,Union City  CA,5,23,19,3/21/2010,4.0,So my friends and I decided to go to BJ's for my birthday. The wait wasn't too long but our waitress on the other hand  totally disappeared after taking our order. When we asked this other waiter who came to help us  he said he'll be the one helping us since our waitress went on break WITHOUT telling us. Anyways  this new waiter made everything better. He was funny and nice. Overall an okay experience.
Ru R.,Newark  CA,55,55,3,6/24/2010,3.0,Good place to go when you got no other ideas. Food is okay  nothing exciting but the pizza there is pretty damn good. Plenty of parking and the bar is good jus a little costly compared to other spots. Never had any bad staff serve me when I was there either.
D C.,Fremont  CA,1,23,1,8/15/2010,4.0,My friends & lost our jobs on March 26  when NUMMI closed. We been having monthly reunions every months since then and BJ's is the only restaurant that we been to twice  has a nice bar  the service and food is good. Plus the price is right for us  since we're all living on unemployment. I really like this place but don't know if we can afford to come here once our unemployment runs out!
Ammar K.,Fremont  CA,5,13,1,8/11/2010,5.0,I had the BBQ Beef with the Oreo Dessert. They both tasted AMAZING! They have their own special made BBQ Sauce which is the best! And dont even get me started on the Oreo Dessert  it was I like my brain and my mouth were having sex. It has scoops of vanilla ice cream served on a bed of freshly hot cooked cake like Oreo's  the BEST.
Sarah S.,Pleasanton  CA,94,94,4,9/20/2009,3.0,"Oh just a typical friday night! What to do? Where to start? We decide on BJ\'s. Start our evening with a couple cocktails and some fine dining. Foodwise  BJ\'s generally does not disappoint. On this particular evening  I seem to remember there being an hour wait and my boyfriend and I wanting to kill some time in the bar as we daydreamed about delicious avocado rolls and pizookies. I stood looking for a table and my bf went to round up some drinks for us  a few moments later I hear my name being called and look over to see my bf motioning for my attention  I assume they wanted to check my id  I understand  I get it  I am 24 years old and look about 19 or 20. I obliged and walked over  ID in hand. The stupid bitch of a bartender says snootily ""we need the real ID  not the fake one."" She followed the comment with what can only be described as a half-assed  watered down witch cackle. I was taken aback  and responded with an ""oh."" I\'ve never even had a fake ID  and what the fuck is up with people who are the same age as me criticizing my age? Bullshit. What a stupid bitch. Food was delicious as ever  and we were seated shortly after that incident. Service was fine. If I was reviewing based on that experience alone  I\'d give it one star. But because the food is delicious  I\'ll give it three. Still waiting to find a BJs that has all the components of fine dining  they have it all completely down except for the staff. Stupid cow!"
Alicia K.,Alameda  CA,12,52,2,1/5/2009,1.0,"BJ\'S IN FREMONT BLOWS!!I used to frequent BJ\'s while living in Los Angeles County and it was my favorite cheap eat with good beer  decent service  and tons of sports on many TV\'s. My best friend and I were on our way to Red Robin yesterday and saw BJ\'s in Fremont and were excited to go there instead...to our dismay. There was ONE game playing on ALL screens??? Ok  whatever  it was the football game but I\'d rather see a variety of sports. Our experience at the Fremont location was so horrible I\'m tempted to stand in the parking lot and warn customers before getting to the door. I don\'t expect much from a joint like this so to taking time to write a long review on a brewery... tells you just how bad it is! We sat in the bar at a six top and there were tons of open seats in the bar and throughout the entire restaurant. We sat and watched over 10 (yes I was counting) employees cruise right by us  talk at the terminals  chat at the kitchen entry doors for 15 minutes until we were finally rudely greeted with menus that were tossed in front of us. 10 minutes after that our server returned and said  ""Can I get you something to drink?"" After 25 minutes you can get us a lot more than something to drink...you should\'ve at least brought out some water. We were very polite though so she had no clue we were frustrated. We placed our order and we were splitting two entrees so the waitress suggested a particular burger they\'re known for...so I ordered it. We ordered rasberry lambic\'s and the server didn\'t know what we were talking about at all?? They have a total of 3 ciders on the menu...you\'d think they\'d know \'em...guess not. After she continued speaking it was obvious that she\'s not the sharpest tool in the shed...lol. Our salads were brought out in about 10 minutes (35 minutes seated and still no water  no drinks  no silverware) and I sware to you...they tasted like dirt...they were just regular side salads but I don\'t know if the lettuce wasn\'t washed or what but it was gross not to mention that the bleu cheese dressing was so runny it ran right off of the dirty lettuce and carrots. So we were quick to put those aside with our fork and napkins left in them. Then our drinks were FINALLY brought out without water...after food had been served...after sitting without silverware and salads in front of us. The salad plates sat on our table in front of us until the end. Then our food was brought out. The best employee was the food runner...she was 10x\'s better than our server...hell  she was our server...we wanted to tip her alone...hahaha. The menu item that the ding bat waitress suggested and that I ordered is not what I received. I guess her stupid self decided to order something else????? We asked for water but never got any  we saw our server go to every table around us and I would have liked to send back whatever it is that I got but no one ever came around to do so. I ate the 1/2 of my friends meal and left my plate sitting hoping to tell our server. She never came. We went to the bar to replenish our drinks since the server was no where to be found and when we ordered rasberry lambic\'s  the EXACT same thing we just ordered and that is on TAP  the bartender didn\'t know what we were talking about...we had to point it out to him...WOW!! Are you kidding me? He also didn\'t know how to transfer the ticket to our table which was dead center of the bar. The server finally came around and we asked for the check. She left the four dirty plates and six glasses on the table and had the check back to us in 10 seconds....dead serious. We didn\'t see her the entire meal but back in 10 seconds with our check. The fastest service we received was our check to get us out of there...what a welcoming warm feeling...hahaha.  Remember on pretty woman when Julia Roberts goes back the boutique and asks the saleswoman  ""Do you work on commission?....BIG MISTAKE!"" hahaha...that\'s what I felt like telling her. My best friend and I are HUGE tippers as we appreciate the fact that serving is hard work and they work for tips as they make minimum wage. My best friend asked for the check and the check was set in front of me. I immediately handed it to my friend in front of the waitress and she placed her credit card and gave it back. She processed the credit card in under one minute and again placed it in front of me...wtf!!?? I wrote a lengthy comment on the back of the credit card receipt and we left her $1.51 as an insult...hahaha...I can\'t remember the last time we did that....it\'s been a long time and we eat out a lot and although we\'ve had bad service this extreme combination of customer abuse was unacceptable!! It\'s sad really because I really liked BJ\'s and we were so excited seeing one close by...oh well...all I can say is DO NOT GO TO THE FREMONT LOCATION! No one should have to pay for that type of utter disregard in a service oriented business...WOW! BOOOOOOOO BJ\'s!!!"
Reina A.,Oakland  CA,1,26,3,8/28/2009,4.0,I love BJs! Their portions are large. Great atmosphere and food. Their drinks are delicious! And oh goodness  the pazookies are to die for! Especially the Oreo pazookies! My fave dish is their crispy chicken salad! Only 4 stars because they took away some of my fave mixed drinks from their menu :(

I call at 5:15 and after 25 plus rings someone finally answers and I request to be put on the call ahead seating for 5:45 p.m.. She tells me that there is no wait and to come on in. I insist that I want to be put on the ""list"" for 5:45 and again she says there is no wait and to come in...""it shouldn\'t be a problem to get seated right away"". Oh yeah? You wanna make a bet? We get there and there are people spilling out all over the place. The wait time? 25 minutes. How can it go from no wait to 25 minutes in 15 minutes? I don\'t get it. I tell the girl behind the desk that I called and she told me there was no wait and how I wanted to get on the ""list"". I\'m super good with voices so I KNOW she is the one I spoke to. She apprehensively says she\'s sorry and tells me that at the time of my call there was no wait. I ask to speak to the manager who apologizes too and says he can get us a table in 5 minutes. The hubby is too pissed and the kids too hungry...we ended up at Claim Jumper where we did not have to wait to get seated and served immediately. Thanks Claim Jumper!!!!"
Joe Y.,Livermore  CA,93,220,4,11/13/2008,2.0,The latest of this national chain (of what I call the Applebees of Brewery restaurants) opened in Newark recently. The food is what is to be expected. Burgers  chicken sandwiches  pasta  salads  make your own topping pizzas  and fish tacos. I had the SPECIALTY CALZONE: BJ's classic pizza dough stuffed with a rich  creamy mixture of spinach and artichoke hearts  cream cheese and mozzarella. Oven-baked and topped with a bruschetta medley. I've had better at Pizza Hut for half the price. What I really came to try was the beer. I'm a beer snob. I had BJ'S Jeremiah Red: An Irish-style red ale with the full-bodied richness of an English old ale. Brewed with a secret blend of five imported specialty malts. Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma. It is an excellent example of a mass produced brewery red. Hard to find this style of beer available year round in small micro-breweries. I also tried the IPA  but have had much better at the local brewery in Fremont. All in all  I thought the service was acceptable  bartenders actually could pour beer  and the atmosphere was typical of their other locations. If I want a quick beer while in the area  I might stop by again. Just skip the food. There is better at Denny's across the freeway.
Chich R.,Hayward  CA,7,12,2,5/28/2009,3.0,Food is expensive and inconsistent. However  the menu holds a wide variety of different flavors. Pizookie is what keeps me coming back  that desert alone deserves 5 stars!
Michelle D.,Hayward  CA,19,125,116,2/28/2009,3.0,this place was cool for the most part. i agree with noel that the parking is horrific and needs attention. be careful to not drive around the parking lot @ night while tipsy  for you may accidentally run into an unsuspecting curb. lol. the food  however  was very good and was a great lunch buy. mmmm
Diana C.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,6/3/2010,2.0,2.5 stars.went there last night (Wednesday night  around 830PM). party of 2. no wait on the table. however  the waiteress wasn't exactly friendly. she didn't even look at us when she was taking orders. we had no utensils when the food arrived. dropped off the bill even when i was still trying to finish my food (i was working hard trying to finish  not just sitting there chit chatting). took her forever to come back for the credit card.i don't know if it was just this waitress  but i had the same experience a few months back.i just thought i was unlucky.food was OK. probably won't go back until i run out of places to eat and forgot how service kinda suck here.
Jennifer H.,San Jose  CA,25,54,6,10/8/2009,4.0,Yes  this IS a chain but it's my favorite chain. I typically go to 2 different locations. This is one of them but I'll review both locations on this post.Despite how many times my high school friends and I have been here  we still come back for the following reasons:1. Even though the wait takes a long time  we can always chill at the bar. 2. The atmosphere is great.3. One time we happened to catch happy hour during the FInal Four. Mini pizzas are only $5 and some drinks half off.4. I really like their pizzas.5. The other food is good too.6. I never had bad service no matter which location.7. My boyfriend and I don't have ESPN so we've been going to BJs to watch MNF. TVs on every corner and wall.8. MNF is awesome there because everyone is into the game and it just adds to the atmosphere. (Plus  I believe MNF is during happy hour).9. The beers are really good. My favorite is the Jeramiah Red (sp?) There must be something in the beer because everytime I come  I get buzzed pretty quick (like after 1/2). It's a great feeling. The other drinks are really tasty too.10. Everytime I come  it's like a party. We always have fun.The food is satisfyingly perfect for when you want to drink.
Seb. M.,Hayward  CA,4,13,1,3/29/2010,4.0,"The last time I visited BJ\'s was for a get together. Service was good. I think we changed tables about 3 times  and the servers were all accommodating. We ended up at the bar since we went there for the ""ambiance."" The bar has an open floor plan  with good lighting. As for food  you should at least try one of their pizza\'s. Lip smackin\' good. Crust is crispy on the bottom  yet the toppings are not overly dry. Right amount of crust  sauce  and toppings. The portion for a large pizza is enough for one person to share if needed. Goes great with the Hefeweizen beer they have on tap. It can get busy at times  but I\'ve been lucky thus far and had no issues thus far."
Tyler L.,Santa Clara  CA,0,12,,5/27/2009,2.0,Most corporate  franchises  and places like that have consistency in their food and service. I give this place 2 stars for their consistency in food  and incosistency in the ladder. A couple of friends and I drank at the bar and the bill was more or less a hundred  that's fine because it was expected. We paid it with our card and left a twenty in cash for tip. The waitress stops by and says that she's got a few more drinks to add onto the tab  I said go ahead  the card's right there. She looks at the twenty and looks back at me and says it's more. I mean  come on  you can't be serious. You're going to nickle and dime a drunk person and then expect that person to pay extra tip when he already threw down 20% on the existing bill? Go to the BJ's in Cupertino  and forget about this place.
Chris C.,Newark  CA,0,6,,7/11/2012,4.0,Great food  great service. I like this place  but you have to try to get there before 6:00 to avoid a wait of more than 30 minutes most days. They're usually pretty busy. I've eaten here many times  and the only time that I was disappointed was when I ordered steak.
Cheryl B.,Redondo Beach  CA,351,221,793,8/5/2009,4.0,YUM! Just got back from a quick lunch here and BJ's still hadn't let me down. Where else can you get a tasty wedge salad and mini 1-topping pizza for $5.95? I looove me some pan pizza! B had the crisp chicken salad (tasty)  and I tried a cup of their clam chowder (also very good!). Good deal. Our server was also very nice and checked on us often. I thought my strawberry lemonade was a little too sweet  but who cares - I enjoyed my lunch and wish I had eaten there for dinner last night instead of the crappy Applebee's down the street.
Theresa L.,Union City  CA,153,173,49,9/14/2009,5.0,I might be a bit biased because my friend used to work there and this is our group of friends' favorite place to meet up and catch up so lots of good memories here. BUT the food is still good! I love the spicy spaghetti with meatballs. The bread it comes with just adds even more flavor to an already good thing :) The appetizers are bomb..good enough to eat as a meal. When youre not super hungry  the portions are just right. The pizookie is the icing on the cake! You could totally make it at home  but sharing it with 5 good friends is totally worth however much it costs. Drinks are decent. My boyfriend's favorite is the buffalo bite  similar to DnB's snakebite  but it's not my cup of tea.
Eegnam A.,Castro Valley  CA,51,424,,9/8/2009,3.0,Always a long wait during dinner. They do have a call ahead option that I would strongly suggest. The food here is like any other BJs. I like the chicken wings  chicken lettuce cups  turkey club and of course the pizookie! I tried the ribs last time and they were good. Soft on the inside  could have used more sauce though. The skinny fries here are really addicting. I like this place for a casual dinner.
JAYE m.,San Jose  CA,4,25,16,3/30/2009,1.0,i wanna rate this place but i cant i've never been thier  but i herd great reviews about it and my boy's always talking about this beer they got thier called a tatonka i love beer so im have to slide by to bj's one time.well i guess i cant post this till i rate it so im give it a 1 till then i'll rate it better next time.
Lauren F.,Castro Valley  CA,24,9,1,6/18/2012,4.0,4 stars... don't get me wrong. i love the food (try the stuffed potato- a baked potato with grilled chicken  broccoli  cheese and sour cream inside) but the line is just crazy every time i come here. it usually doesn't stop me but i find it annoying
RdWin G.,Fremont  CA,3,5,,11/5/2011,2.0,"called to see if they took reservations...""Corrine"" answered the phone in a manner that conveyed I was interrupting her! Guess I\'ll see how the food & service will be...it\'ll be my first time there...their ""first"" impression isn\'t so great...we\'ll see"
jen r.,Fremont  CA,2,43,1,12/15/2011,1.0,"this review is merely on the Happy Hour... never again.their HH deals are horrible.... $1 off beer? there\'s gotta be better deals in the area!  unless you\'re there specifically for the pizookie  food is largely forgettable. we even made a mistake of ordering their ahi poke and it was tuna mush... i\'m still expecting for the food poisoning to commence.  fried calamari was ok.  i\'ve had way better pizzas.what bugged me the most was the sucky service during HH. we walked in at 4:30pm and the main dining area was completely empty and the bar area was maybe a third full of other HH\'ers. it took forever and a day to get our food.  then when we were done  it took our server 20 mins after she said ""i\'ll get your bill right NOW"" to actually give us our bill. bar area wasn\'t even all that busy  so i didn\'t get what the hold up was all about. nevertheless... major fail!"
Skyttle D.,Fremont  CA,80,61,3,9/23/2009,5.0,This place has the most amazing food ever_very delicious! Great customer service as well as great friendly servers/waiters. Wait time for a table was quite long (1hr 45min)  but it was worth the wait.
Alan N.,San Francisco  CA,49,158,4,8/14/2009,2.0,After being away from the states for 2 years and coming back home to see how much more fat americans are compared to the rest of the world... then I go to BJ's and it explains everything. The portions are huge. Quantity over quality.
Alan D.,Fremont  CA,30,11,1,5/22/2011,4.0,I don't understand the negative reviews I have been there more times than I can count. Only once did it take a long time for food. I have been to the yard house twice and so far I prefer BJ's food. Can't beat the beer at the house though.
Lady S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,29,,3/23/2012,3.0,This place is ok. Their menu could be a little better. Their pizza is really good though. I don't like that their breakfast menu is only on Saturday and Sunday. I go here when in a hurry during the week. Love the curb side pickup. Never had problems with the service.
Erica T.,Reno  NV,149,118,36,6/22/2009,3.0,I thought it was just San Bruno and San Mateo  but I'm glad to know that all BJ's restaurants have a ridiculous wait time! We decided to grab a beer in the bar while we waited for 45 minutes for our table. Of course the bar was just as packed  but we were able to score one stool at the end of the bar (thanks to the lady who decided to give up the stool that her sweater was sitting on!?!). The bartender was very pleasant and served us right away (no need to throw money in their direction!). She even let my boyfriend test-drive some of the IPA's they had on tap before committing. I tried out the new flatbread pizza appetizers  which I ate as a meal  and they were quite tasty. Good bang for your buck! My wedge salad had a bit too much dressing on it  but who needs to cry over spilled bleu cheese! All in all  BJ's is relatively consistent with their food  beer and long wait time!
L W.,Santa Clara  CA,0,6,,3/1/2011,1.0,This time around the service was horrible. The buzzer didn't work  the lady who sat us forgot to transfer my bar tab to my table  and my server forgot my gravy for the mash potatoes. Horrible service tonight.
be q.,Union City  CA,0,8,6,11/21/2010,3.0,Good food  bad services! Been here twice for lunch on the weekend  the place is full  the food is quite good  especially the Thai shrimp wrap. The waiter was not attentive. Keep forgetting to bring us ultensiles  cordiments etc.
E N.,Hayward  CA,91,18,6,7/26/2010,1.0,beware  our car got robbed in broad daylight  in the bj's parking lot. bad area with zero security!!!! the staff told us that this is an ongoing problem but said they couldn't do anything about it. they said security was not their responsibility even though it happens often in their parking lot. just want to warn everyone!!!!!
Jess C.,Fremont  CA,25,59,7,10/23/2011,3.0,Fun atmosphere. If you call ahead  wait is not too bad. Food is mixed. I like to order the jambalaya  but sub the rice for pasta. Pizza is terrible. Don't even try. Pizookie always please as do the drinks.
paul t.,Santa Clara  CA,73,83,1,12/28/2008,3.0,I had me a cesar salad  tomato brisque  & the bruschetta. Cesar salad was well balance and the soup was a tad salty for my taste but was okay. THe worst offender is the buttery greasy bruschetta thay had. Traditionally bruschetta is great with baugettes with a light drizzle of olive oil but this place actually butter the hell out of there bread which is not the business. Would i eat here again? yea of course  try the other dishes but if it aint happening once  twice  and 3x your out!
Julie G.,Hayward  CA,7,31,,9/3/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Went here again last week when family was visiting from out of town. We had 6 people and a baby and did call ahead seating for lunch. We had a brief wait for a table  but not more than 10 minutes. The service was great  the food was good  good time was had by all. Now I'll have to try this place again to see if they can keep up the good work or slide back to mediocre.Our table had a appetizer combo  next time I'll just get the avocado rolls. We learned that the only difference between the lunch/dinner items was the price and not the quantity of food. I had the fish tacos  one fish  one shrimp. Next time just the fish...the shrimp wasn't very good. Hubby ordered the sliders  he was happy with them. Mom and Uncle had the unlimited soup/salad combo and liked the tomato and minestrone soups. Aunt had the Italian chopped salad and loved it. Can't remember what Dad ordered  but no one complained about their food  so I guess he liked whatever it was.
Alvin W.,Fremont  CA,220,328,87,5/4/2009,4.0,I've been here on three occasions and now I can compare the service and quality of food. The quality of the food is always fresh and consistent  although due to the slow service  the hot food turns into warm food  or the cold food (aka salad) turns into warm food.Visit #1 - friend and I both ordered a wedge salad and an entre. My salad came out but her's was no where in sight. So far in sight that her giant veggie baked potato and my chicken cobb sandwich arrived to the table. We had to remind the server about her salad  and waited another few minutes for it. Slightly irritated  she didn't hold it against them because after we placed our order with our server  he went to break and another server took over. The veggie baked potato was pretty good and my chicken cobb sandwich hit the spot.Visit #2 - found an online coupon for $5 off so came here again. Like the first visit  after our server (different from my first visit) took our order  she went on break and another server took over. Service was pretty good. She was attentive and friendly. We did an order of avocado egg rolls  bbq beef sandwich  and I got their soup & salad combo. The avocado egg rolls are darn tasty with that sweet sauce. The bbq beef sandwich was sliced into thin slices so the flavor really came out. The Caesar salad was crisp and fresh  and the Tuscan tomato bisque was a bit oily but flavorful and spicy. Visit #2 was better than visit #1.Visit #3 - came here with the extended family to do an early mother's day. We made reservations for 14 at 6pm. Upon reaching our table  it was only set up for 12. The server was a bit irritated with the hostess and scolded her to check on the table BEFORE seating guests. LOL  I'm thinking this server knows what's going on! So after we get additional seats and get situated  our server takes our drink order  brings the drinks and then tells us she's going on break. WTF  it's it my luck that each time I come here my server takes break and someone else takes over? The service was as good as can be considering our party was a group of 14. I know she had to serve other tables but service was slow this time around. I have a feeling that some of our food sat at the counter before we got it as multiple people ordered the same thing; i.e. two people ordered soup. One was warm  the second one was forgotten and when it came  it was piping hot. Same scenario with hot water for tea  and soft drink refills took about 10 minutes. In all fairness  I can relate to a large party and also serving other tables  the restaurant was crowded.Over all  I'd give this place 3.5 stars but I'll round up. Service does need to improve in order for me to give them a legit 4 star rating.
Jo W.,Sunnyvale  CA,10,85,2,7/30/2011,4.0,Went here with a group of 8 people on a Friday night and it took about an hour to get us seated. We didn't have a reservation  so...sounds about right. My friend and I split the beer sampler  which was a good deal for the price (8 5 oz. beers for $8 I think). The food was pretty good (I got the salmon teriyaki with rice) and the ambience was nice for a group hangout (dim  loud but not to the point where you have to yell). The servers were friendly; however it took almost an hour after we were seated for our waitress to take our orders for the entrees. Maybe because the first one who took our drink orders went on a break and someone was covering her?
Jennifer D.,Hayward  CA,195,600,19,4/30/2009,3.0,The pizza here is deep dish  the way I like it  but overpriced for what you get. I like that there is a beer selection-try the red ale. The pizookie is also good.
Vivian R.,Fremont  CA,75,38,3,8/26/2011,3.0,Everyone loves to rave about BJ's and it always is packed. The food is pretty good  but too pricey. The avocado egg rolls are amaaaaazing. I would recommend the appetizer sampler (which includes the avocado egg rolls) and their signature pizzas (sweet pig is my favorite). Service is not great  they should hire a few more waiters because they rarely come around after serving your food.
Ken H.,Milpitas  CA,9,15,,8/7/2011,3.0,came here for lunch the other day. nothing really special. everything is always the same at bjs  not saying that its bad but so far havent really ran into anything here that has amazed me
S J.,San Ramon  CA,1,99,15,1/25/2012,5.0,I absolutely LOVE this place!!!!!!  Pizzas are awesome! Beer is awesome!  I think Ill go there for dinner tonight......
Carol P.,Fremont  CA,2,17,,11/16/2008,3.0,It has only been a week or so since it opened  and I'm willing to give it time to work out the service issues. If that improves  and it almost can't help but do so  then it will get more stars. Friends and I had lunch there on Thursday  and it wasn't bad. In fact  service was pretty good for the most part. We split the avocado eggrolls  which were excellent. My friend had the fettucchine alfredo (I seem to recall) and she said it was quite enjoyable. I ordered fish tacos. We both had wine  and their selection is acceptable  if not outstanding. Then we took family out for dinner tonite. There were 8 of us  including three children. BJ's doesn't accept reservations  but you can call in and they will put your name down. Nonetheless  it can be trying to wait for what they said would be at least an hour. It turns out we only had to wait for 45 minutes total  not too terrible for a brand new restaurant. As it was before  the food is pretty good. It is bar food  sandwiches  pastas  burgers and the like. All three of the young ones had spagetti with marinara sauce from the children's menu and it seemed acceptable. Adults had jambalaya  fish tacos  strip steak with potato  and chopped salad  as well as a Tuscan pasta dish. Jambalaya was pretty good  and so were the fish tacos. The steak was good  etc. Kids had the children's sundaes  and they looked wonderful  even to the adults. We all split the brownie with whipped cream and I think ice cream - yummy  but huge. Even with five adults  it was a bit much. All in all the food is quitte good for what it is. Service  however  really needs a tweak. The servers were all very friendly and apologetic when they brought a chopped salad that was supposed to be with out the meat .. and wasn't. I had to wait quite a while for my first glass of wine - probably 30 minutes all told. In all  it took more than an hour and a half to get through the meal. I think it will get better; it not  they will have a problem. Parking is abysmal but again  once the parking lot is finished and Mervyn's is gone  that shouldn't be an issue. We will be back  but we're giving it a couple of weeks. It is nice having a big  well designed and attractive restaurant in Newark. I
Juliette E.,Livermore  CA,0,17,2,1/21/2012,5.0,Okay so I went here on a saturday for lunch.....The place looked nice and clean inside. Prices were very reasonable and the menu was huge. The food was good. I especially liked the stuffed mushrooms. Yummy! The drinks were good too. I tried the mixed berry mojito. It was delicious. Our server's name was Catherine. She was excellent. Everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend.
Emma F.,Fremont  CA,1,13,,1/13/2012,2.0,The friendly bar service cannot make up for the host staff. Leaving a customer feeling blown off (pager apparently never entered into the system) guarantees a frustrated experience. The food is good  and the service can be  if you ever get seated. This could have been 4 stars instead of two. As it is  BJs will drop from my go to list for a while.
Holla b.,Fremont  CA,88,1,,11/19/2008,3.0,I have never been to a BJ's Brewery before so I had nothing to compare to like most of you. My friends drink beer but I do not so I am glad they have other beverages to offer. We went for lunch and the cost of lunch is what I liked the best. That is why they are getting 3 stars. Now..I must tell you that I work in a restaurant and I too expect good service no matter where I go. I know BJ's just opened so they certainly need to iron out the details. The service was nice but SLOW! Not slow because they were busy but because the severs were not serving with a sense of ERGENCY.!! You can serve be polite   give great service and still turn a table fairly quickly. That was not the case here.Lots of servers and LOTS of standing around. I guess that is to be expected when you open when you really don't know what to expect volume wise. I will give it another try later on down the road.
Betty W.,Fremont  CA,2,54,,7/26/2009,2.0,"Since I\'m definitely not a fan of chain restaurants  I can\'t give an unbiased review  but here it goes. For a chain BJ\'s is ok. The pot roast was very tasty. The sodium content of almost every item on the menu is astounding. If you\'re watching salt or fat or calories  this is not the place to go. It\'s big and loud and charmless  IMAO. The portions are huge  which to me is unappetizing. I\'d rather pay less and get less.  Moreover  I\'d rather support the smaller ""mom and pop"" restaurants around where there is more of a personal touch."
Christa M.,Fremont  CA,112,74,,9/28/2010,3.0,"I\'ve never been truley impressed by this locations service. One time I went and our server was so rude that he dropped off our food  went to another table to talk to these people (I think he knew them personally) and never came back to our table again to see if we needed refills or if the food was alright (which it wasnt). Our pizza was cold  both of us needed refills  we ended up getting so desperate for service we asked the buser to help us!!! That\'s not their job!! The server knew we were upset because when he dropped off the check he just put it on the table and left. Never said a word like ""thank you for coming in"" or anything. Another time  we had a server who forgot about our table and never came up to us for 15 minutes! When they got to our table they rushed through our order saying ""what do you want to get"". I haven\'t been to BJ\'s recently since these past two times but I might give it a try in the future. I just would like to see the area clean up a little bit. Put in some stores already instead of a boarded up Mervyn\'s and a fenced old circuit city."
Lei L.,Milpitas  CA,1643,175,17,2/23/2009,4.0,"Nutty Blondy + New York Steak Medium...cesar salad was ""ok"" i could\'ve made it better...but the steak was perfect!....add a lemon!"
Krista B.,Milpitas  CA,97,37,,4/3/2011,4.0,I've been here quite a few times since they have opened and have even ordered take out from here  but haven't dined during a busy night until recently. I went on a Friday night around 9pm. They don't take reservations  but they have a call ahead feature where you can call when your 15-20 mins away to put your name on the list. Love that idea!!! Instead of waiting an hr for a table for 2 we only waited 10 mins. The drinks were good- I had A Drink Like That and my friend had a peach sangria. Both were delicious. For appetizers we have the chicken lettuce wraps and for our entres I had the grilled chicken club with clam chowder and my friend had the jambalaya. Both were good. The food was not disappointing  it was more or less our server. She was very nice  but she was wayyyyy to busy and had too many tables. You basically have to flag her down for everything. Flag her down to take your order  give you your check  etc. Other than that it was a great dinner.
Danielle G.,San Lorenzo  CA,31,14,,8/15/2011,5.0,One of my favorite spots for date night! I love all the food! Everyone is so friendly and ready to help and answer all your questions. Sports atmosphere which i love but it also has a romantic feel. I also had my birthday here and everything worked out perfect and i had a fabulous birthday! Can't wait to go back soon. Make sure you try the stuffed baked potato!! Personal Fav.
Erin D.,Scottsdale  AZ,159,7,,5/8/2009,3.0,ehhh it's ok. I like the variety of beers on tap and the deep dish pizza is good but that's about it... any of the other menu item's I've tried have just been ok (pasta  salads  giant baked potatoes) Service is alright but haven't had anyone impressive. I'll come here when I get off work since they stay open so late and have that late night happy hour. Yeah I know having a table coming in a half hour before close sucks but hey I'm helping pay your bills right? I work in the industry too so I know how it is. So sitting in the bar area at a table isn't the best place to be because the servers act like they'd rather be anywhere else. Sit at the bar  bartenders are much more friendly and give way better service.
Starla L.,San Francisco  CA,45,139,204,2/19/2009,3.0,I give 5-stars for their deep dish pizza. I had heard it was good  but I didn't think it would live up to all the hype. I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizzas like the ones from Zachary's in Berkeley  so I didn't think I'd like this one. But the crust was crispy  dough not too doughy  and plentiful toppings.Service is another story. It's practically non-existent. I've been here twice so far  and both times the server did not bring us utensils/napkins until after the food arrived  and after we had to flag them down just to ask. They don't make themselves available if we need anything (like ordering our food or getting the check). After the food is served they disappear...until it's time for the bill. Then they're super friendly. A little too late.The wait is long on weekends. They don't take reservations  but you can call ahead and tell them you're on your way and they'll put your name down so your wait time is minimized by the time you get there.
Uland L.,San Jose  CA,34,131,22,8/6/2009,3.0,Came here with several coworkers and we were seated fairly quickly. Large dining area and the wait staff is very friendly. Ordered their prime-rib sandwich with shoe-string fried onions ($14)  unfortunately they forgot to give me the shoe-string onions. Upon asking the waiter  she comes back a few minutes later with a fatty plate full of shoe-string fried onions  enough to share amongst several people. Overall  this sandwich was really good  plus the beer selection they had was great. Total bill was around ~$20 for my meal.
Joseph G.,San Jose  CA,37,40,,6/3/2009,3.0,This Bj's is alright at best. My friend and I both ordered Blue Moons but they ran out of oranges and gave us lemons. The service was slow  but our server was nice at least. There is really nothing much to say about this place  it is just so-so. The only reason I had a good time here was because I was with great company  but if I was with anyone else  this place would just suck
cedro t.,Lehi  UT,37,84,155,3/12/2009,3.0,Chocolate lovers... try the triple chocolate cookie icecream thing (the PIZOOKIE). Sit at the bar to get in quick. Waiter was nice both times. Food is average  hence 3 stars. I've been back for the PIZOOKIE. Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate.
Adrian L.,Union City  CA,21,24,5,9/12/2010,3.0,been to Bj's a about 3 times and i have to say their menu is getting better  i would only go here for appetizers and deserts though.
brett m.,Pleasanton  CA,117,28,1,3/19/2011,3.0,Good but expensive
Kirsten M.,Newark  CA,83,101,,2/9/2009,2.0,The menu is good. They have alot of options. What I have had has been good. They have alot of good beers to offer as well. I just wish the service didn't suck so much. I'm going to try it again after it's been open longer to see if that improves.
RJ A.,Hayward  CA,294,45,9,1/8/2011,3.0,This place is alright. Very sports bar orientated. They have a lot of televisions so practically every sport is playing.The restaurant is pretty big very spacious. SO yeah this place is a brewery so they have a lot of different types of beer. The one I had recently that was pretty good I believe it was called Jeremiah Red. Got pretty buzzed after two pints of it but I also didn't eat yet. The food is pretty good and they are more known for their specialty pizzas. The one I enjoyed is called the Great white which has a mushrooms  chicken  tomatoes and garlic and instead of tomato sauce they use an Alfredo sauce that is really good and a worth a try if it's your first time there. Finally on the menu for dessert it's a definite must try is their pizooki which is icecream served over a warm cookie.It tastes ever so good. The only problem with this place is the service.It isn't that it's their fault. It's can just be really busy and most of the time it is. So the waiters and waitress are running around everywhere. So if your a person with patience then you should be fine if now try ordering to go .
Alexa O.,Hayward  CA,16,43,,1/5/2009,4.0,Came here for the first time a couple weeks ago!.. waiters and staff were really friendly!  but considering we only came her for drinks  I can only rate accordingly. Very disappointing  tasted a lot like water!.. yeah too much ice  I don't know  maybe it's just me  but if I'm paying for over priced drinks  I like to taste the alcohol..I'll be back  to taste the food.
Tito R.,Mountain View  CA,0,9,,5/12/2009,3.0,I usually avoid chain type restaurants in the Fremont area due to the epidemic of poor servers these places tend to be plagued with & elbow to elbow crowd of locals that all seem to look & act the same.WTF is it with Fremont?Anyhow  I have to admit I went into this BJ's quite skeptical & expecting the usual crappy Fremont experience.Well I was pleasantly surprised to the contrary here. Not too bad.I've been twice & both times I left pleased with the experience & a very full belly (oh yeah  good buzz too  hehehe...).The place is big  clean & bustling with business - which translates to everyone in the area is trying eat here right how.Let me say the wait was very long  I'm sure it was because we went on a busy nite (Friday) and I guess it isn't necessarily there fault if everyone & there mama wants to eat here right now.But what i didn't like is they didn't let us make reservations over the phone so we had to show up & wait (party of 4).It was so packed there weren't even enough of those pager things  we had to check back 20 mins later to get one.It was about an hour wait  but this was offset by hanging out at the bar which wasn't that bad  though there was no space so you are kind of stuck standing in the middle of the floor holding your brew & dodging the waiters going in & out of the kitchen.The bartender was your typical Fremont'y 20-something bartender  but luckily I didn't get the bad attitude I'm accustomed to at these type of places. For being so busy he took care of us in a timely manner  offered refills & I tipped accordingly.The beer was good  BJ's house brews are a beer drinkers delight  I stick with the Blonde.After we finally got seated our server came pretty quick to ask if we wanted anything to drink & I am happy to say she had a great personality.BJ's scored points here with me  she genuinely seemed committed to making sure we were enjoying our evening there.I wish I remembered her name to give her a shout out!BJ's must actually interview there applicants & gauge there customer service ability - THANK YOU .Our group ordered a deep dish pizza (warning: the pizza will knock you the eff out. Its good & BIG!).Nachos  wow these are good too. They did not suck at all  we actually ran out of chips for dipping in the left over salsa & our waitress was KIND enough to bring us an extra serving of plain nacho chips to clean the plate with!I had a chicken sandwich & man it was GOOD.Big portions  we had to take a lot of stuff home!No complaints with the food or servers here !For being in Fremont & a chain brewery/food type place this place is not bad at all.Go with some friends / family & I think you will have a good time with some good food & drink.I hope they can maintain this level  its not the best I've been too but it's good enough that I will definitely go back.Fremont is notorious for bad making places like this go bad fast.Lets hope that doesn't hold true here.
Francine T.,Fremont  CA,71,10,,2/23/2011,3.0,Cobb salad $11.50. Good selection of beer not so much for the wine. Many TVs all sports. Be sure to call ahead for seating otherwise there will be a long wait. The service varies.
Ali H.,Sacramento  CA,19,177,3,12/5/2009,1.0,I wish I could give this place a 2nd chance  but I just cannot do it! The place is beautiful inside  nice ambiance with the big screens and nice art. The service  just plain sucked. I always order half's with my Sis so we may try more food  Yum... We decided on the Bacon Cheeseburger & Chicken Club  why not  the holidays are here. We got the burger  no bacon  fair enough  told the server and he actually went and got the menu to see if we were telling the truth.... Came back and asked if we would like bacon on the side and explained to us that he would usually have to charge us for it. Seriously he came back with 3 of the thinnest pieces and for a moment  I thought it was a joke. I told him he should buy my beer and he said they can't do that... Really? So he actually did  the tip showed it! The management did not seem to really care either  the food court in the mall might have been a better choice. I agree  the food is garbage! Save a bunch of scrill and go to Mission Pizza  down home and delicious!!!!!
Bob T.,Fremont  CA,0,5,3,7/9/2009,5.0,God I really love this restaurant; not just because they have great food  they help me to retrieve my lost digital camera. It has been 4 days  and I thought I was going to buy a new camera; however  when I asked the server about my lost camera  they kept it for me!!! This is a great restaurant  and you will not regret of coming here.
Oliver H.,Fremont  CA,8,29,,12/26/2008,2.0,good beer !!  bad food !!poor service !!...did i mention...good beer !!   (great variety of beers but don't expect too much help from the staff)
Bella B.,Bay Area,0,77,,3/31/2009,4.0,Went on a Saturday nite -- got there around 9:30pm. Our party was seated within 10 minutes. Our server was friendly  helpful  and energetic -- and didn't rush us for our order  and after our food arrived  she checked in just enough to let us know she was available  which allowed us to enjoy our casual dining experience.For beer  had the Brewhouse Blonde -- very good.For starters  had the Angus Beef Sliders -- very good; and the combo appetizer platter (sorry  I've forgotten the name)  which had my favorite appetizers.
Kathleen T.,Fremont  CA,4,9,7,5/17/2009,3.0,Went here with the little guy  aka my brother  my parents  and my mom's friends. It's really nice looking inside...but now to the most important part: The food. The food took forever  and we ended up finishing our drinks  and the soup. We had Tomato Bisque and Clam chowder. The tomato was way too sour  and the chowder was creamy  however some at the table found it quite salty. And we wait. For an hour. And my cream soda was long gone  but I reccomend you try one of those Bj's Sodas. Anyways  when it arrived after an hour  the guy forgot our fucking utensils. WOWWWWWWWW.I dug into my now lukewarm jambalaya  and it's huge  and surprisingly delicious. All in all  the food is pretty good  if you know what to order  but the service isn't exactly the best....
Shadi A.,Hayward  CA,10,4,,3/19/2011,5.0,I love this place  service is great  people are friendly and the product is good. Been here a few times and each time left happy
Megan T.,Redwood City  CA,54,55,1,2/24/2009,4.0,We had a large party of about 25 people and four them being kids. Our service was outstanding. Our waiter was very attentive  brought refills on drinks without asking.....got the kids orders first so they wouldn't be hungry. The food was average but I was very impressed with the service. The other bummer is that BJ's in Newark is located in a ghost town right next to a bunch of stores that have gone out of business and are all boarded up.....
Jello P.,Fremont  CA,0,28,1,2/20/2011,4.0,The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is solely because of the clam chowder bread bowl and the pizookies. Everything else is just overpriced and bland (pizza  pasta  sandwiches...). So I used to think the only place I could get some good tasting clam chowder is at pier 39 in SF  but now I don't have to go that far to satisfy my clam chowder cravings anymore. If you're going to get clam chowder at BJ's  get it with the bread bowl  it makes all the diference in the world! The bread bowl is toasted to perfection and they flavored the lid of the bowl with butter  some herbs  and cheese and OMG that hits the spot! The clam chowder tastes great; has enough clams and potatos  and goes very well with the bread bowl. Lastly  the pizookie  what a great invention. My favorite is the cookies and cream and my second favorite is the white chocolate macademia. The cookie is chewy  but not soft. It's warm when it comes out to you topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream  you get this awesome mix of warm and cool in your mouth.
Ashley M.,Fremont  CA,0,45,,4/5/2011,2.0,Terrible quality restaurant for its price. I've been here twice and both times their food has made me sick. It's overpriced for the quality of food and service they offer. And the wait? Just forget about it. I'd rather make a trip to the mall across the street and eat at Anderson's Bakery or even Red Robin.
Giovanni F.,Fremont  CA,6,10,1,1/23/2011,3.0,It's a total fail if you use their call ahead system and they don't put your name on the list! The only reason I left them with 3 stars is for the food and beer. A definite FAIL on calling ahead for a table. You have to wait the same amount of time regardless!
Allen B.,Fremont  CA,0,3,,4/9/2011,5.0,Ine of te nicer places here in Fremont  especially great for first dates! I lived te happy hour and the choice of pizzas is huge. Also  very nice service; the managers actually walk around greeting diners.
Gab a.,Union City  CA,0,1,,1/31/2011,1.0,This was my 1st time going to a BJs and.. Its was a nice place except the service and food was ridiculously terrible. Idk if it was honestly the reserants fault but it might be the server mayra? Or Alex?? She completely forgot the birthday girls salad and food another person salad.. There was only 4 of us ... Terrible and when we finally got settled and got our cold forgotten food got to us it was :( bad. And I didn't like it the pizza was soggy . But maybe I'll try it again as long as it don't take 3 hrs to get seller and eat maybe next time !!
Anna P.,Fremont  CA,0,2,,11/27/2009,1.0,BJ' at Newark ..reservation desk is a mess. Recent friday  we called BJ' three times and they assured us that wait -time is only 30 mins and added our name to the list......when we got to BJs they told us we have to wait another hour to get our seating.....so o we left and our 7 yr old said that she never ever wants to go to BJs.
moh h.,Fremont  CA,3,24,20,3/5/2010,5.0,very good chicken wings and pizza and there bartenders makes some cool drink i like it must go place if u live in tri city
greg n.,Fremont  CA,6,3,,6/16/2009,2.0,"Came in here this past weekend for lunch. We were trying to decide on where to eat and this place has consistently been reliable. Not today. Wasn\'t too busy for a Sunday and was seated within 15 minutes. Our waitress was friendly and helpful as usual. We ordered the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps for an appetizer  the spaghetti with meat sauce and the pot roast dinner with a cup of clam chowder. After waiting about close to 30 minutes our appetizer came out  followed immediately by our main dishes. The appetizer was brought out by our waitress and our main dishes followed not even 1 minute later  served to us by someone different. Our waitress noticed what had happened and apologized and offered to take the main dishes back while we worked on our lettuce wraps  but I declined because I did not want the food getting cold. So we just ate everything at once. I also informed her that my soup never came out  which she apologized for and offered to take it off the bill. What pissed me off was when I looked at my pot roast. I have had this numerous times in the past and have always been satisfied with its generous portion size  not today. My plate had maybe 7 small pieces of meat with the gravy being nearly nonexistent. No broccoli with my veggies  just all carrots with a huge onion cut in half. At first I thought  ""Is this a lunch portion?"" So I finished my food but was annoyed the whole time I was eating because I was looking forward to a hearty meal only to find a kid size serving. They tried dressing my plate up all fancy but this isn\'t Manresa or some other classy restaurant  it\'s freaking BJ\'s! When our waitress returned she asked how the food was and I asked her if the pot roast was a lunch portion because it was so small. She said there is no lunch portion for the pot roast and babbled on with some reason which I tuned out cause I was pissed I was paying 14 bucks for a dish that wasn\'t even worth half of that. So all in all  if this is the turn they are taking where they down size the food while keeping the prices the same  I won\'t be coming back  to this location at least. Boo!"
Ambar G.,San Ramon  CA,4944,244,313,11/15/2008,4.0,listen  it has only been open for about a week  its the first major chain restaurant newark has landed in a long time. this is why it is overcrowded  not to mention the screwed up parking that is not even finished yet  there is alot of demolition yet to be done. of course the grand opening is going to be loud and slow- no one wants to disappointed. give it some time. there is a reason why this place is loved in southern california. when mervyns shuts its doors  there will be plenty of parking! newark is working on a couple other chains that will compliment this chain...just give them a break for now. for people complaining about price- sit home and have a tv dinner  we live in the bay area for gods sake. you cant diss the menu variety- if the beer sucks drink hard liquor.
Mike M.,Santa Clara  CA,25,271,20,12/7/2009,4.0,Been wanting to check out this place since they opened a year ago at this location. First off  the place is huge. The dining area is expansive  same goes for the bar  and they've even got a special dining area sectioned off for private parties. The atmosphere is similar to Cheesecake Factory. I've heard that waiting lines can get long during peak times  but when we came here on a Sat for lunch  we were sat down immediately. The food is above average. We ordered a half-and-half deep dish pizza  the classic and the mediteranean. It does the job if you're craving deep dish but Zachary's Pizza in Berkeley/Danville is still my fav spot for deep dish. We had the white chocolate macadamia pizookie for dessert which was a nice treat  a little over the top but a nice treat once in awhile. Anyhow  prices were reasonable  service was good  parking outside is easy  and an upbeat atmosphere. Another plus for all the flat screens which is great for catching games. We'll be back here again.
Brenda T.,Fremont  CA,1,29,1,5/22/2009,1.0,I joined 4 friends her at 5:30pm during happy hour and it took 30 MINUTES to get a cocktail and 15 minutes to get a beer! Upon asking the server I was told a bartender had gone on a break! HELLO IT IS HAPPY HOUR. We ordered some appetizers and after trying to serve us some elses appetizers when they arrived they were not anything to write home about. The nacho had practically no cheese - hmmmm nachos and cheese I thought they went together. I don't recommend this place unless you have all the time in the world. We spent $200 for drinks and food and it was not worth it.
ek b.,San Jose  CA,0,46,1,8/2/2010,4.0,This place is fantastic. We went there for a small office event and we had a great time. The drinks were superb and the appetizers were awesome. The avacado rolls are highly recommended. The food though in general was mediocre. But overall good place. Try the beer sampler.
Vas B.,Fremont  CA,0,9,,1/23/2009,1.0,I ordered a Veggie Garden Burger - I have not eaten meat all through my life - the guy at the Take out brought me Turkey burger - I sent it back and he made me wait for 45 more minutes to return with what was supposed to be Veggie burger - Of course I did not suspect it - since it was made clear that I needed a veggie - I went home - bit into my burger (it is against my religion to eat any meat) - of course I find that it is Turkey - the whole place is sad. I called back to complain only to get a lukewarm response that they will refund my money - of course you are gonna refund me my money - it is not like you did me a favor - I took the burger back so they can do whatever they want with it....I am not at all recommending this place.
Alan O.,Fremont  CA,23,26,,4/7/2010,2.0,The visit could have been much better. Reason- great lack of energy on the serving staff's part. There had to be at least 6-7 on the wait staff including a manager( from what was seen). We had a birthday that evening and only one person sang from the staff. To me that shows a lack of effort on making a customer feel invited. The food was decent and came to our table at a reasonable pace. Our server was helpful and she served us well  however  the lack of energy from the rest of the staff needs improvement. She even asked the manager to sing along and no comply. This is a place where you can just count on having it as Take-out orders rather than spending your time in there. Another Yelper commented on this being like the Fremont's Elephant Bar- in some ways it is- but the staff at the Elephant Bar treats the customers a little bit better- Remember a good business validates their customers. BJ's might need to work on that before i want to make another visit.
christine c.,Pacifica  CA,0,4,,6/2/2012,1.0,This was one of my first trips to this BJ's in newark (I have been to the San Bruno and Foster City locations and they were far better). We had a large party of 12 on a Saturday night  but we had made reservations prior....so the restaurant knew we had a large party....yet for some reason it seemed like they were not prepared. We arrived at 4:30pm and were told that we had to finish our meals by 6:30pm. Which we all thought would not be a problem. However  it took our waitress 45 MINUTES to BRING WATER to our table and to top it off waters  sodas  and drinks were not refilled unless WE ASKED her for them. 3 pizzas were ordered and came out COLD  a steak was ordered medium but came out burned and well done  the manager offered to replace one of our pizzas since it had been cold when it reached the table. It was a combo pizza  however  the pizza that came out to replace it was not a combo. In return the manager had given us the steak free and offered a pizookie plattechrr. The lackluster waitress didn't bring a menu or explain what the pizookie was  so many of the people at the table who had never been to BJ's before had no clue what this waitress was offering us. We walked out of there at almost 7pm  and the entire 2.5 hours our waitress was talking to her family  hugged a child  and was chitchatting with another waitress. We observed a waitress who kept touching her hair  putting pens in her mouth  and never washing her hands when she came around to pick up plates or serve. Sadly  the manager tried to save our waitresses sinking ship (who stated over and over again it's not my fault the kitchen doesn't know how to follow instructions  and I am just the messenger)  however  her lack of customer service skills  telling us her life story (I work 2 jobs and have a daughter)...we really don't care....bring us our water and food we ordered and be friendly. I can say that all the food runners and busboys were working over time  probably to accommodate for the crappy wait staff. Wish our forced 18% tip could have solely gone to the bus/servers. I have NEVER had such a bad experience at a BJ's restaurant ever  and will NOT return to the Newark location nor will I recommend this location to anyone.
Je M.,San Jose  CA,614,185,5,11/22/2008,2.0,"no stars for telling us we had to wait three hours  when in actuality  we waited 30 min.no stars for the rude hostess who when i asked to be updated on our wait time responded bothered and annoyed and i quote  ""your wait time is 120 minutes you\'ve only been waiting 23 minutes (rolls eyes)."" BEEYATCH plz.But one star for the pizookie that made me feel fat.and one star for our awesome hostess  who may have only been nice since she knew my brother? haha  but no she was sweet."
erma c.,El Cerrito  CA,2,16,2,2/21/2010,1.0,it was not what i expected. anyhow.. to keep the long story short. over priced for the type of food we had. the drinks were not what we expected either .. plus the service front the front desk threw it in the trash as well.
Devyn P.,Union City  CA,23,37,1,1/13/2009,2.0,Love the food  hate the service. This chain is phenomenol but this store in particular is the black sheep for them. I have been here at least 10 times a already and the service has been beyond crappy each and everytime. I think I would rather drive to San Mateo for the better experience and stick with takeout at the Mowry location.
Kelli S.,Hayward  CA,4,14,2,2/4/2010,2.0,had the pulled pork sliders  calamari  pot stickers and pot roast. none of which were especially good. the pot roast was very dense and had a texture like pressed meat  not the tender fall apart type i am used to. also the meat had no flavor. the attmosphere is good-young crowd. ok beer  but the food reminded me of microwave dinners which no amount of atmosphere can make up for : /
Ryan B.,Fremont  CA,0,21,3,11/12/2008,3.0,We went tonight.. Food was ok  nothing that great. spaghetti came out with hardly any sauce  so i asked for more and it tasted ok. Sammy was a good server tho  she got our refills quickly. Atmosphere is very nice  the big TV is cool. Its just not a place I would go to alot.
DJ A.,Fremont  CA,1,10,,2/25/2010,5.0,Wonderful pizza... Great Service... and they make their own Cream Soda... Freakin Awesome.
andrew a.,Hayward  CA,4,22,9,6/3/2009,5.0,The best place for thick crust pizza. My mouth waters for their combination pizza. Don't be fooled by the size. This pizza is so thick that you are actually eating two pizza stacked on top of each other. Their food is pricey but the environment is what you are paying for. Great selection of alcoholic beverages and the televisions are mounted all around the restaurant. A great place to watch the game and have a drink. Excellent pizza and social lounge!
Katy B.,New York  NY,20,72,36,3/4/2009,4.0,I'm giving this place 4 stars  even though I was disappointed with some things...I didn't realize I needed to call 24 hrs in advance to make reservations...So I called the minute they opened that morning-literally and they told me I couldn't make them...So we went anyway-party of 10-I know it's big...Then we got there an had to wait an hour and a half...Which sucked  but I really wanted to try it...The guy giving out wait times kept changing the times for different people  wtf. The bar was completely packed and service there was average  if not lower than. Good beers though. I ordered the balsamic chicken which was okay  but tasted burnt  but wasn't. The cheddar mashed potatoes rocked my freaking world. haha. Then the pazookie (I think that's what it's called) is the dessert cookie...OMg that thing was AMAZING. You have to get it if you go here! Our meal was moderately priced...I would go again and try different things.
Kei T.,San Francisco  CA,0,30,,6/22/2009,3.0,"In all honesty  this place does not live up to the hype that it receives. Sure  you can joke around with the name a couple of times  ""Hi  welcome to BJ\'s. How would you like it today?""  but after a while it just gets tiring. I went here the other day because my friend raved to me about how AMAZING the pasta\'s here were. But  WOW  really? Amazing must be a pretty ordinary word in his dictionary because the pastas that we had ordered were so much stuck in the ""eh"" section that it did not even catch sight of the amazing mark. We ordered two things here  the Angel Hair Toscana and the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta (the ladder is MUCH better). The only thing that actually made the meal really enjoyable was how nice the waitress  a skinny and tall caucasian woman  was and how many televisions there were posted around the room. Aside from that  the pastas itself is nothing to go nuts for and definitely not worth getting your hopes up. Sorry to smash the image  but its true."
jen t.,Newark  CA,119,79,3,2/7/2009,4.0,Wow  so we pull up to this place and the last I remember of the area it had a rasputins (now closed) and the new mervins that opened and then closed right away. But the building is beautiful. We had dinner here for my cousins bday and the place was super super busy (it was a saturday night) We had to wait for almost an hour for seats but we were fine with that. We sat and chatted for a while and looked over the menu. The food looks really good and I had the cajun pasta with a Super delicious Nutty Brunette beer (SO GOOD) My meal and beer was fine but my mom ordered a fish taco and got a shrimp (she is mildly allergic to shrimp) and my sisters margarita tasted like it didnt have alot of booze so she went and bought a shot of cuervo to go in it for an additional $7.50. (thats part of why I like beer) Over all the experience was good  we had fun but on the weekend this place was CRAZY! The waiter was professional and willing to help. The food was good but on the pricey side. I will prob visit again sometime.
Bamboo H.,Hayward  CA,146,65,1,12/28/2008,2.0,I do not really recommend the BJ in Newark but I do recommed the one in Vacaville. Vacaville was the first Ive tried and they had excellent customer service and all the food that we ordered was good. My bf and I tried the one in Newark 11/08 and the Pizza to the onion bloom was salty as hell!!!!!  The waitress was an odd duck first of all and had a weird sense of humor. Anyways  I ordered the Oreo Pazookie and the waitress tells me later that they ran out of Vanilla ice cream? wtf? Second time I went there was on my fathers bday 12/21/08 and again they ran out of the oreo pazookie? I mean if you know that there is a hot item and are known for it.....wouldnt you make sure that your restaurant would have it????
preethi m.,San Francisco  CA,0,14,,5/4/2009,5.0,Some friends and I went here for drinks and dinner on saturday. I have been to other BJ's before and this was my 2nd visit to this particular location. I love the ambience and the dcor of this place; It has a very casual yet elegant feel to it. The only thing I hate is the long wait  many times we've decided to go to another place since the wait here was over 1.5 hours. I guess everyone in Fremont knows how good this place is....We've tried some beers here and all of them were good. This time I got the berry cider beer which is more of a cider than a beer and it was good. At our table we got the: Avocado rolls which was amazingGrilled chicken salad - which is topped with awesome onion ringsTomato soup - which had the freshest ingredients  it was a little too creamy for me but it tasted really good...Grilled chicken sandwich - came with the crispiest friesMediterranean pizza- which was very goodI think our waitress was either new or was helping too many tables at one time. She kept forgetting our drinks  silverware etc. My friend asked for the Grilled Chicken sandwich with soup and not fries but when he got it  it had fries. When he asked them about it  they happily got him a bowl of soup and let him have the fries too. I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and since I was going to share it  I asked for the chicken on one half and no meat on the other (I am a vegetarian)  but when it came to us  it had chicken all over. My husband had already put a slice with the chicken on his plate and started eating it. When I asked the waitress about it  she called in the guy from the kitchen and he took it back to have it fixed. I suspected they would just pick the chicken and bring out the rest   but no... they were baking another pizza. The manager came to us and apologized for the mix up  it was no big deal as we were having a good time with friends and there was other food on our table. She offered to get me some soup till I waited  which I thought was very nice of her. Then came my pizza the way I wanted it...it tasted awesome. The manager went one step ahead and took the pizza off our bill as it took a long time to get it done right. I thought this was super nice; they really didn't have to do that. The folks here make customer satisfaction their priority  even on our previous visit they made sure that our food and service was perfect. The food and the people make us want to keep going back to this place. Its great to come here with friends as you can e sure of having a great time....Kudos to the guys at BJ's- Fremont!!!
Julie Z.,Surprise  AZ,0,4,,3/23/2009,2.0,I have eaten at BJ's in Maui  Newport Beach  Boulder and Burbank and had fabulous experiences. What a disappointment the BJ's in Newark was.  We were seated in a dirty booth that we had to wipe down to remove the food products left on the booth seat. Never recvd our appetizer. And never offered a refill on our sodas. Perhaps our waitress missed career day??
Joe W.,Henderson  NV,0,13,,2/11/2009,4.0,I come here for the BEER! Get the Red  it's the best The food is what you'd expect at a joint like this. The location is like a pool of water in the middle of the desert  because all the other tenants are out of business at this shopping plaza. Be prepared to wait on the weekends though. The service I got was pretty good  but the waiter seemed overloaded with work & my order took pretty long.  I didn't mind  cause the beer mellowed me out quite a bit!
Lorice A.,Fremont  CA,0,4,,8/2/2010,1.0,"I don\'t believe I can even rate this place.We couldn\'t even get a table for 6 after waiting a total time of 1 1/2 hours. Thursday  July 29th my daughter and 4 teens (grandkids) and I arrived at 6:40pm. We asked for a table for 6 and the hostess told us it would be 30 - 45 minutes. We decided to wait. After the 30 - 45 mintues had passed  we would see parties of 5 or less be seated. most of these were groups that came in way after we arrived. We asked the hostess what was going on. She told us that they were waiting for a table of 6 that had already been there for 2 hours to leave so we can have their table. I asked is that the only place you can sit us? She could not answer. I watched her go to her manager and he did not offer her any suggestions or did he try and come over to explain  apologize  nothing. They just let us continue to sit. Finally 1 1/2 hours had gone by and another party of 5 was seated after only being there for 10 minutes waiting. I asked the hostess what was being done to get us seated  she replied they were still waiting for those people to leave. I asked if she was telling me that they couldn\'t accomendate parties of 6 or more? Once again no answer. I suggested putting table together or bringing a chair up to the booth. The manager came over and said the table where the other party of 6 was seating was their only option. They could not push tables together or add chairs to booths. I told him we had now gone over 1 1/2 hours of waiting and the other party had now been there for 3 hours. His response was only  ""well thank you for waiting all this time"". He could care less. He is a perfect example of a terrible manager who has no clue how to manage a resturant. I have been to 2 other BJ\'s in other towns and never experienced such stupidity and lack of experience. This place had people sitting on floors waiting. BJ\'s truley needs to find a more competent manager. This guy was awful. We will never try this location again. If you are going there to party and drink  it may be the place for you  but if you are a family  be ready to be put at the end of the line and forgotten about."
Marcus W.,Union City  CA,0,21,,3/14/2009,2.0,I sat down and saw the tab for the people who had the table before us. They had left a 10% tip. Sure  the food is good and it came out quickly  but is it anything you can't get from Amicis  Giorgio's  Claim Jumper  or Elephant Bar? On a busy night  you gotta ask yourself if it's really worth the wait for pizza  beer  and other items on the menu for the waiting time (40 mins) and the frustrating service? You won't get any service unless it's your assigned waiter/waitress. I waved to one who was just standing 5 feet away not doing anything and was totally ignored. I had to put my arm in the way of another to stop them. We had to ask for utensils after the food started to arrive. I didn't have much confidence in the waitress afterward and had to prompt them for the things you automatically get from other places. Things like soda refills  ketchup  pepper/cheese for the pizza  and even the check had to be asked for. It's the only business left standing in the whole block  so if you see that the parking lot is pretty full  a better experience awaits elsewhere. It'll be better when the bloom wears off this place and they can weed out all the bad waiters/waitresses. In the end I also left a 10% tip.
Dale Y.,Alameda  CA,0,10,,1/1/2009,5.0,this is a nice place to eat good food. this is the second location but first in the east bay location. the other location is in san jose by westfield mall. the food is good but A MUST is to get a PIZOOKIE dessert. it is a must and cant be missed.
