21,Tom H.,"Patterson, NY",5,18,,3.0,2013-02-03,"Same as every other Applebee's. Best bet is a cold draft beer. Good place for budget eats. Get there on Tuesday nights after 8pm for trivia night.

27,James W.,"Weymouth, MA",1,20,,1.0,2013-05-17,"Finally, I know what it's like to be invisible.  My wife and I were seated promptly and were told Kristen would be our server.  We eventually got to see Kristen who appeared after almost ten minutes.  Communication?  Not sure.  She took our drink order, never asked about an appetizer,  so Applebees never got that order.  She brought our drinks and walked away, again not asking about an appetizer (yes, we wanted one).  She eventually returned and took our dinner order.  My wife liked her ribs, but I really didn't like the Lemon Shrimp Fettuccine (not her fault, I just didn't care for it).  When Kristen next  appeared we requested the dessert menu and she was kind enough to bring one.  After a couple of minutes, and the menu sitting on the end of the table, she must have taken the menu on the end of the table as a signal to clean the table next to ours instead of taking our order, so she didn't get that one either.  All in all, not a great experience.  We were just passing through, but locals who go there, be forewarned, the service is slow.  Of 3 sales opportunities, this employee missed 2.  Applebees, how much business can you afford to lose before you train waitstaff to do a better job?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brewster-4?start=20,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000005

20,Al T.,"Bristol, CT",0,3,,1.0,2014-10-31,"My grandson picked this place for his birthday lunch. We got  there together with his parents at about 2:30 AM on Saturday, October 25th. After we were seated, no waitress showed up for over 10 minutes at our table and we were unable to make even eye contact with any waitress, so I got up, went to the hostess area and told whoever was there about this problem. A waitress did show up shortly thereafter, apologized and said that they ""forgot"" that we had been seated at that table. After we ate the meal, she asked if we wanted a dessert menu, and we said yes. She came back about 5 minutes later without a menu and we said we wanted to pay, which we did. I have to say, that I barely can remember another restaurant where I experienced this kind of unprofessional and inattentive service! it appeared as if there was no supervisor/manager present to coordinate and oversee the restaurant. And the restaurant was even only moderately busy at that time!  All of us were disappointed/upset and discussed alternative restaurants in the area for future restaurant visits. We also discussed how to go about tipping, even considering not to tip at all, but settled on 10% .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brewster-4?start=20,,,,,

As we were seated my 2 year old didn't want to sit in  the highchair and started to cry. The hostess didn't miss a beat and came over with a toy to distract him which worked wonders.

14,Blass B.,"Brewster, NY",19,47,4.0,1.0,2015-07-26,"If it were possible to give zero stars, I'd give it now. This filthy pathetic excuse for a chain restaurant goes down as a total nightmare. Time after time they have disappointed us in so many ways  (service, food quality)yet I had never given them a review but this was a long time coming. I went there and got take out the other day for lunch. Mind you, only a couple customers, a couple waitresses and a male manager (sitting and hanging out like a customer) were in the front of the restaurant at the time. I ordered Pub Pretzels with the beer cheese and an Oriental chicken salad. I paid and drove home and when I unpacked my meal, it was immediately obvious that they had some wise-ass working in the kitchen. The Pub Pretzels had a big cup of mustard and a small cup with less than a teaspoon of beer cheese (which is mostly why you order them), and the pretzels were hard because they had been microwaved to partial dehydration. I was starving and decided to opened the salad after deciding to nix the pretzels. I thought the dressing looked off so I decided to taste it prior to putting it on the salad added the dressing. This makes me furious because it immediately burned my mouth and throat and tasted rancid. I called Applebees and eventually got the manager on the phone, who listened to my complains. He said he just got there and apologized (see above, he was there the whole time) and offered a $10 gift cards of my next visit. My husband put everything back in the bag and took it back to Applebees for a full refund. The manager offered some flimsy excuses and tried to apologize but it seemed like this kind of thing just happens so often they are no longer embarrassed or surprised. Went to Eveready Diner instead.  Would recommend you go anywhere but this Applebees. Anywhere but there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brewster-4,,,,,

My family orders take out from here at least once every month and it just keeps getting worse and worse... Last night they completely omitted an item we ordered and everything else was cold and extremely small portioned. We called and they said we could get a free meal next time but who knows what that even means because we spent almost $70 on barely any good last night. Very disappointed.

I Was charged 7 dollars for one beer I had traveled a half an hour to get the drink specials for happy hour. The waiter had the audacity to tell us otherwise.

10,Ashley V.,"Fishkill, NY",0,1,,1.0,2016-11-12,"Ever think to yourself ""I could go for a one star restaurant experience right now"". If so, this Applebees is the place for you. You know I'm not one to post reviews, let alone negative ones but this place has inspired me so much I just couldn't help myself. I always try to be empathetic towards waiters and if I have an unpleasant experience I try to give them the benefit of the doubt. But there was no reason for my friends and I to wait over an hour for our meals. Our waitress had an attitude from the start and took a long time to even take our drink orders even though there were probably more waiters working than actual customers and therefore no reason to have to wait so long to take our orders and for us to get our food. Like I said I'm usually understanding and if service is slow I figure the kitchen could be backed up or something but I found that since there were barely any customers there in the first place, this couldn't be the reason. Not to mention our waitress didn't even come over during that entire hour we were waiting for our food to apologize for the long wait or to see how we were doing. After waiting what seemed like the entire length of the movie Titanic without seeing our waitress or our food I was getting hangry and cold. Oh, did I mention we were seated next to a door that even though it had a sign on it to keep it closed at all times, the workers decided to ignore and keep open so the nippy November air kept hitting us. I should've know there was a reason the entire staff was wearing north face jackets. So not only am I hungry at this point but I'm closer to getting frostbite than I am to getting my food. If Harambe was alive this probably wouldn't have happened. After being ignored and feeling like I just got into a fight with Elsa I tried my best to let it go. Our food arrived and when I went to ask for ketchup (what kind of restaurant doesn't put ketchup on a table) our waitress had disappeared . It wouldn't be for another half hour until we'd see her again... the food was pretty disappointing for all three of us. I should mention we have pretty low standards. I am not picky when it comes to restaurants or food but I was just so angry at this point which is pretty rare for me. I saw our waitress walk past our table several times but never once stop to ask if we need anything. I NEEDED KETCHUP. I even saw her standing around at one point doing nothing. None of the other workers asked how we were. I started to feel like we had Ebola or something. (We don't). We were going to order dessert but we're so displeased we just asked for our checks when she finally checked on us. This location really needs to get their shit together. Also why are you called Applebee's? Doesn't even make sense. This experience was probably more devastating than the election results.

7,Indira P.,"Danbury, CT",0,35,5.0,1.0,2016-11-22,"Sigh! This is my second review for this location, Sunday Nov. 20th my husband and I went for a late lunch since we were in the area. We walked in and noticed it was not crowded at all given it was Sunday during Football season and it was snowing! We walked in and sat down at the high top bar tables and waited 10 mins before the waitress Terry in our section acknowledged us and asked if we needed menus. We gave us the menus and said someone would be with us soon, Another 10 mins go by before our waitress Michelle D (who had an entire section and at least 5 tables) was able to stop by and take our drink orders. I asked for a Fat Tire and Michelle D had no idea what that was (it's a craft beer currently on tap). She apologized for the delay and was very professional and gracious.  This is what really bothered us, the entire time we sat at the high top the floor manager Kim was there saw us come in and sit there waiting and not once did she much as have someone help us or even let us know they may be shorthanded.  In my opinion, if you are a manager at this Applebee's location you don't care, you don't care about your employees, your job or most importantly your customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brewster-4,,,,,

There waiters lack professionalism and do not care about you the customer or frankly their job. The management has to be pathetic also because the food is horrible and slowly prepared. Plus I've learned people only perform at a low level if you don't push them for excellence. The waiters were having a great time with each other instead of tending to customers needs.

We had a couple other rounds after that, each worst than the next. They literally gave us margarita mix, water over ice. There was no tequila added, period. I couldn't believe it, I was paying to drink straight margarita mix. The boneless wings were good with ranch, mozzarella sticks were cold and only okay. 2 stars solely for the boneless wings.

The only reason this location gets the third star is because the meal generally was ok - except the meat, which wasn't cooked the way I wanted, but still fine.  The menu is standard for all locations and this was no exception. The ""2 for $20/2 for $25"" choices are blah. I kind of think they should have a better selection for those ""deals"".  The waitress was friendly and attentive. The place was clean and spacious enough. Memo to Applebees - you should only put lemons in drinks when people actually request them. Not everyone likes lemon in their sodas or water. Just an FYI.  They have these little doohickeys at the tables where you can pay your bill, swipe your card, order etc. Not a bad innovation. It's my first time seeing that anywhere, though it could be just the area.  They share the land and parking lot with other businesses, but you should be able to find a spot.   So it's an Applebees.
