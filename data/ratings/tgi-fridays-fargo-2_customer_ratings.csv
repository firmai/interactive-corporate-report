11,John B.,"Fargo, ND",0,8,,1.0,2012-04-27,"If I could give 0 stars I would! Wow, $6.09 plus tax for a captain Morgan and coke, and almost 7.50 for a crown and coke. This is Fargo not Vegas. I don't even think a Morgan/coke in Vegas is that much! And when I asked to speak to a manager he came over, was very rude and cocky and didn't really want to help us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
7,Leon W.,"Winnipeg, Canada",1,12,4.0,1.0,2013-03-30,"I'm sorry, but this was my least satisfying meal...ever! Ordered Sirloin, got Ribeye at best. Lobster was chewy :( Best thing I can say is the service was good. Would go to McDonalds any day of the week over this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
15,Courtney W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,34,8.0,2.0,2013-07-16,Food is terrible. Skimped on everything.  Bruschetta chicken pasta was incredibly oily.  Jack strips were burnt. Our waiter was great and that's the only reason we stuck around. Skip it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
8,Joshua S.,"San Diego, CA",198,486,234.0,2.0,2013-11-02,Good food but need more staff. So slow. Ic could probably draft an encyclopedic review in the time it's taken just to get out waters. Still waiting and been about ten minutes. Have been here several times and it seems to continue to get slower and slower. Really annoying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
12,Marc B.,"Fargo, ND",3,57,28.0,2.0,2014-01-28,"Two stars because the server was nice, but as far as the food goes, I won't be back. My  steak was tough and chewy, like leather. The french fries were mushy and limp and the mixed vegetables were overcooked and runny, the waiter apologized for giving me ""too much"" broccoli (3 whole pieces) Honestly, the whole meal tasted like it had been frozen and then microwaved. The best part was the drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,

16,Lauren L.,"Moorhead, MN",29,1,,1.0,2014-12-14,"My friends and I went out to eat as a going away celebration for a friend. We got to the restaurant at 7:15 and ordered maybe ten minutes later. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and was pretty quiet. We were seated so all 8 of us had a very clear view of the kitchen, specifically where the cook hands the food over to a counter where a wait staff picks it up. About 45 minutes later we hadn't gotten our food and were questioning what was going on. We waited around some more and around 8pm we noticed the manager walk back to the kitchen. He then proceeded to look at some of the food (which was clearly ours) with the wait staff, as if deciding if they could serve it. They all looked puzzled and were examining the burgers together. Then the manager clearly ok'ed the food to be served, grabbed a French fry off one of our plates and walked away. This was appalling and unsanitary. They served us our food and left. Not a minute in did we notice that the meat of our burgers was crumbly and strangely cooked and that there was little of what we had asked for. No one was satisfied. We asked our waitress for more avocado and about 10 minutes later we were brought a dish of 3 chunks of poorly sliced avocado with the inedible rinds still on them. The four of us who asked for it were expected to share and derind it ourselves. A few bites in we couldn't help but notice the not great taste and the poor quality. We then a second time caught the manager go back to the kitchen, scratch his beard, grab a plate, eat a fry off it and then deliver it to another customer as he was chewing their food. We were disgusted, stopped eating, and asked to speak with him. He came over and we told him about the food quality, our dissatisfaction and were polite about it, too. We then confronted him about the fact that we saw him eat food off his customer's plates. He denied it completely even after we retold him exactly how it happened and that at least 6 of us saw it happen both times. What happened to the customer's always right? He told us he didn't eat it and didn't scratch his beard and touch the food or plates, then told us he would see what he could do. In the time it took him to do that, we also witnessed two men in street clothes in the kitchen. One of which pulled cigarettes from his pocket, gave one to the cook, and then left again. The manager came back and covered our meals but seemed like he was just ushering us out to avoid getting in trouble. Overall, we were appalled and disgusted with our experience and we don't want the manager's or any of the other employee's lies and unsanitary habits to get any other customers sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
2,Rochelle M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,2,,1.0,2015-02-22,"Just went here for Sunday lunch with my brothers family and my husband (4 adults, 2 kids). We only picked Friday's because Granite City had a 45 minute wait, but we walked right in to Friday's. The young hostesses wanted to seat is at high top tables in the bar, not conducive for a 5 and 2 year old. Upon request, they said they'd check with a manager to see if they could put 2 tables in the restaurant area together for us. Good idea.  Then to the food. First, milk was ordered for the kids, but our server came back shortly after we ordered to tell us they had just run out of milk. Keep in mind, we were there an hour after they opened and the restaurant is literally across the street from a grocery store. So the kids drank water. It took a long time for soup and appetizers to come out, and then longer still for entrees. Kids meals were supposed to come out first but didn't.  Fries and boneless buffalo wings were room temperature, my husbands burger was overcooked. The celery that came with the wings was limp and rubbery - obviously old.  For the $90+ meal for the six of us, the only good thing about this trip to Friday's was my Diet Coke and shelter from the -9 degree temperature outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
6,Erik B.,"Fargo, ND",3,18,,2.0,2015-03-30,"In my trips my food has been bad (overcooked burgers) to passable, and tending toward overpriced for what you get. If you are there on happy hour it can make things manageable. It's never my choice of destination.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
1,Maura Q.,"Olympia, WA",4,29,12.0,3.0,2015-04-17,"My husband, 2 year old daughter, and I went here for lunch at noon this past Wednesday (Apr 15th). The host greeted us as we came in and catered to our request to sit in a booth. He was a very nice young man.  I had the Friday's Shrimp and my husband had the French Dip. We got our daughter the kid's all natural chicken skewer with grilled pita/flat bread and a fruit cup for the side. Our food was enjoyable and I have no complaints about my fried shrimp because they were pretty good for a chain restaurant; however, my husband did think that our daughter's chicken was a bit bland and he expected her food to have a bit more flavor/seasoning. She ate her meal fine so I don't think she minded it at all. Husband thought the French Dip was decent.  The only complaint is our waitress was not well informed of the menu at all. Every time my husband asked a question about anything she had to go back and ask questions to the kitchen/bar. She even admitted to us herself that she needed to brush up on some things. On top of that, I had to ask the food runner for a drink refill because our waitress also failed to ask me if I needed a refill when she visited our table to drop off my husband's beer. I purposely placed my empty drink glass at the edge of the table  so she would see it when she dropped the beer off (and that didn't work apparently).  Even though there were only about 3 tables sat (not including us), it took a ridiculous amount of time to receive my drink refill. The waitress did apologize for that so I won't hold it against her, even though my husband did tell me that 90% of the time she was hanging out in the waiter's station doing nothing.  This certain TGI Friday's location needs to train their wait staff better. With that being said, I certainly won't be opposed to returning in the future (preferably for dinner instead of lunch).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
0,Ty T.,"West Fargo, ND",0,19,1.0,3.0,2015-04-19,"My wife and I came for the second time in about a month or so. Currently they are running there endless appetizer special. The food is good. However, the hostess seemed less than enthusiastic when we walked in. Granted it was a Sunday but since they had only opened 15 minutes before our arrival and there were only four tables in the whole place we were kinda confused.  Our waiter was good. Very knowledgeable. However he seemed to be less than enthused as well. Overall not bad but enthusiasm could be higher.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
4,Alisha L.,"Fargo, ND",114,27,8.0,1.0,2015-07-01,What happened to this place?  The terribleness of the food was so terrible it disheartens me that I can't give it negative stars.  Shared the 3 app special for $12.99.  The cheese that goes with pretzels resembles some weird preserved cheese before mixing some Kraft Mac n cheese.  The potato skins have changed so much into a weird fried potato blah with a slab of cheese and bacon. If anyone liked these years ago....they are not the same!!  The boneless wings were ok but nothing to write home about.  There is a reason this place seems to be going out of business & it should.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
5,Brittney S.,"West Fargo, ND",4,30,,1.0,2015-07-12,"The food was terrible. My dad and I only went because we had free appetizer cards. We knew before coming in that our experiences with the restaurant have not been satisfying. We ordered the loaded potato skins as well as the BBQ chicken flatbread. There was barely any cheese on the potato skins, and the bacon tasted like plastic. The potatoes were rotten, & we got some more potatoes because the employees and manager saw how horrible the potatoes looked. The flatbread pizza was okay, with barely any BBQ and the chicken having the texture of rubber -- with barely any taste. My favorite part of the meal was the water, even though I could tell the glass was amazingly unclean. The free food was not even worth it! Do not spend your time going here -- there are plenty of other restaurants to go to.. Good ones even!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
13,Pam N.,"Wyndmere, ND",0,4,,1.0,2015-08-23,"My husband and I decided to have dinner at Friday's on the spur of the moment.  He ordered the cajun seafood pasta thing and I ordered the Sizzling Chicken & Spinach.  First of all, since we have the Friday's card, we ordered the free chips and salsa.  The chips were warm, but half of them were mushy and the salsa was served in a little cup that was too tall to dip our chips in.  We waited forever for our food because ""the kitchen was waiting for the pasta"".  When our food finally arrived, I was given a chicken dish, but not what I ordered.  I pointed this out to our server (who really tried her best).  She took it back to the kitchen, returned to our table and told us that my dish had been delivered to the wrong table.  They would bring out my meal as soon as possible and that the manager ""would take care of it"".  By the time it arrived, my husband was completely finished with his meal.  I guess the manager ""taking care of it"" means the manager will bring it to the table (after walking all over the restaurant looking for us) and saying ""Sorry about that"".  Because that's all he did.  Silly me, I thought that surely my meal would be comped.  But no.   The bathrooms were messy--in fact, according to my husband, the men's room had one empty soap dispenser, one broken soap dispenser and a paper towel dispenser that was hanging halfway off the wall. This Friday's needs new management...or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
3,Bailey S.,"Fargo, ND",22,17,2.0,4.0,2015-11-06,"I don't know why the reviews are so terrible for this place. You're at a chain restaurant, you should expect chain quality for the food and service. I actually don't find the food bad, it's on scale with other chains as far as quality. I also don't order something that might be sup-bar and that they don't specialize in, like the ribs. I've had the sandwiches and burgers and they were good. I also had a parmesan chicken dinner that was pretty good as well. It's a good place for the family to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
10,Vicks S.,"Redmond, WA",0,14,1.0,1.0,2015-11-13,One of the terrible places I have visited. The service was entirely slow with no apologies. The manager ( an old lady ) was extremely rude and lied to us reasoning the delay stating they did not prepare it correctly so did another one when in reality the chef said after preparing they dropped it on the floor. That manager was not at all apologetic and didn't even allow me to speak. The food is also terrible and definitely not worth the price they post on the menu. I would definitely not visit this place again nor would recommend anyone to visit this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
9,Joshua W.,"Fargo, ND",0,8,,5.0,2015-11-22,"Went here to watch the NFL on Sunday and had a great time! They have plenty of TVs with NFL Sunday ticket, and the service was very good. I had a cheeseburger with the black bean patty, which was good, and sweet potato fries, which were very tasty and well seasoned. For dessert, they have an amazing Vanilla Bean cheesecake with white chocolate mousse- I might go back specifically for that! Overall, I have no complaints and enjoyed watching my game there, will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fargo-2,,,,,
