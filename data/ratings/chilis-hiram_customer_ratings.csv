31,David P.,"Dublin, GA",29,226,19.0,2.0,2012-01-04,"Ate with the fam on a Tuesday at 5pm.  We were one of 10 guest in the whole restaurant.  We quickly ordered drinks and dinner, I got the chicken taco.  The food arrived in a quick manner then everyone in Hiram with 3 or more kids showed up at once.  Once that happened we never saw our waitress again.   My tacos were dried out, my water never got a refil and we waited 15m after our table was cleared by the manager to request the check.  After 5 more minutes the check finally came and I paid cash so I wouldn't be there when they closed. I don't know if it was the time of day, lack of servers or what but it stunk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002

Food was barely warm and pretty tasteless,  I ordered the Southwestern BLT lunch combo that came with fries and a house salad for $6.  My niece had the pizza and fries off the kids menu. The Paradise pie was good, but they were kinda of skimpy on the caramel and chocolate sauce.   I will return but only during dinner hours because this is my first not-so-good experience here.  I'm going to say its the lunch time staff that just didn't have it together today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

I ordered the queso which was gross and although they had ground beef in it, it was terrible. It taste like the meat from Taco Bell and you couldn't taste any cheese in it. My server was terrible. I seen her at my table twice and she messed up my order because of course she didn't write it down. The manager was nice enough to refill my drink after complaining and taking off my appetizer but I was so disappointed that I didn't even bother to order a meal.

36,Kelly W.,"Hiram, GA",0,5,,1.0,2013-04-20,"Two friends and myself ate here last night. The whole experience started off bad. 1) I tried to call ahead but the phone was busy for 20 minutes. Do they only have one phone line? 2) my friend's strawberry lemonade tasted like weak kool-aid, after three tries for them to ""remake"" it she gave up AND THEY STILL CHARGED HER FOR IT. 3) they left ingredients off of her food and two crucial ones off of mine. I ordered the guacamole burger with a veggie patty. It's supposed to have grilled onions and peppers, grilled jalapeños, and guacamole. I got about three tiny slivers of grilled onion, and they had to bring me the guacamole and japs on the side after I had eaten half my food waiting for the server to come back. 4) We had to wait for water refills every time. 5) Our server took our order, checked on us once, and brought the dessert and tab. Every other thing was taken care of by a food runner--the best employee I saw was a well-dressed young man around 18 years old who had been working there THREE days. 6) All of the rest of the staff was unkempt and rather redneckish...I know it's Hiram, but they were dressed in camouflage. All of them! It's apparently a weekly theme. They looked sloppy and not at all like a consistent level of service you would expect from a chain. Very unprofessional. 7) when the three people who had been attempting to serve us realized we ordered dessert, it might have been nice to get it comped. I don't know if we should have even eaten it--it took forever to get after we ordered it and by that time it's after 10 (we were sat at 8:00) and they can't seem to make hot coffee that late at night. I drank two lukewarm cups and we got the heck out of dodge. I'll go back if I can have a server who speaks coherently and wears clothes that fit, and maybe brushes their hair now and then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
35,Bill S.,"Powder Springs, GA",0,26,,3.0,2014-01-17,Good burger. Other things range from good to so so. Picking up take out orders provides a view of the kitchen that can be a little disappointing to see.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
22,Alana R.,"Savannah, GA",43,43,7.0,1.0,2014-12-29,"My family and I (6 total, 2 kids) went last Saturday night after Longhorn had a 45 min wait.  We waited for 25 min at Chili's.  It took forever to get everything.  And we never had everything we needed.  One person had the fajita trio and I had the steak/shrimp fajitas - we thought you couldn't mess up fajitas - WRONG.  First, they serve all the condiments for fajitas in these little towers in tiny cups.  My tortillas were soggy and cold.  The fajitas came out steaming for me but the others weren't which meant they had been sitting in the kitchen.  The chicken tasted like it had been frozen.  One person ordered a simple burger and got the wrong one according to our server.  So the server brought the right one and the burger still had nothing on it even though it wasn't ordered that way. Now I will say - this place was packed but halfway through our meal we had no idea why.  When we left I realized it was because it took so long for people to get their food.  Poor management in the kitchen?  Our server was very nice and seemed embarrassed that we had everything to go with our fajitas but not our fajitas for a ridiculous amount of time.    The only good thing I have to say is that the southwest egg rolls and the spinach dip were good - but of course these are frozen and I can get them at the grocery store.   DO NOT visit this Chili's.  Go anywhere else.  Literally anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

The service at this location has gone downhill SO bad within the last few years. The service here is very slow, not the friendliest, and very (how should I say) forgetful. The staff at this location is definitely in need of more training. However the menu selection (like all Chili's restaurants) is wonderful and very diverse. The perk of this location is whenever you're ready to leave, you don't have to wait even longer for your server to come back if you pay with a credit/debit card on the tables tablet. That's the best thing this Chili's location could have done. Warning about the tablets- all games on there cost $$...

Last time we went they had a iPad at the table which we didn't use but got charged 99 cents for having it at our table.

Bad- The server was accurate with our orders, but not friendly or welcoming at all. Seemed to be rushing us out the door from the moment we sat down. Ugly- witnessed a family(including an infant) sit without service(after ordering-no food brought to table) for over an hour. Once the staff was notified, there was little effort to fix the problem. No vouchers or coupons, no addendum to the bill. Nothing. They were forced to pay full price. Not a good look.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20,,,,,
24,Carmen C.,"Smyrna, GA",37,49,,1.0,2015-09-11,"This used to be one of my favorite fast-casual restaurants.  Back in the day, before they discontinued the Awesome Blossom, I would order that, Southwest Eggrolls, Molten Chocolate cake and I was a Happy Camper.  Then they got rid of the Awesome Blossom.  It's possible that was the beginning of the end, when Chili's ""jumped the shark"".  Or jumped the chili pepper, in their case.  But I digress. They've changed their menu recently, it seems like they are trying to emulate more of a Chipotle-esque kind of feel.  Not a fan.  Not just of the menu changes, but of the service.  I'll stick the service at this location, which I have gone to three times in the past two months, once to sit down, once to take out.  Slow.  SLOW.  SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!.  And all the times I have gone during off-peak times when the restaurant wasn't even half full.  So I don't get it.  I will say, I am appreciative the woman working the ""To Go"" side of the restaurant checked my order before handing it to me.  Because it was missing items.  But I remember they said to give them 20 minutes to prepare the To Go order, I gave them 30 and they were still scrambling to get my order ready.  Meh. Now back to the menu.  Thank goodness they still have southwestern egg rolls.  And Molten Chocolate Cake.  But the other items, I do not care for.  They've even changed the mashed potatoes with the steak!  It used to be bacon and chives, now it's just some kind of cheese almost ""fried"" into the potatoes.  It was kind of odd. I long for the Chili's of days past, when the commercials were singing about Baby Back Ribs a cappella.  But I suppose that ship has sailed.  The Fonz has jumped the shark, er, uh Chili Pepper on water skis.  (shrugs)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hiram?start=20,,,,,

He walked as slow as molasses to greet me when i walked in the front door.  And when he got there his presentation of himself was just dirty looking and very unprofessional.   Other than that server was attentive and friendly.

I've had a peppered sirloin with mashed potatoes, loved it. They're burgers are really good. The chicken crisper with honey mustard and corn are really good, seasonings on it, good. One time at the chili's in Rome, my son ordered a pizza, and it didn't look good at all; he was very disappointed that day. So, if they haven't changed their pizzas, I would not recommend those.
