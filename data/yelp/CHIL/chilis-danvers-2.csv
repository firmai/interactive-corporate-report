Adam K.,"Danvers, MA",0,7,,5.0,2/5/2015,"Don't listen to all those people giving Chili's a bad review, this is the greatest restaurant I have ever been to.  No matter where you are, you shouldn't be too far from a Chili's restaurant. It is a huge worldwide chain, with a famous Tex-Mex style I will always love. The food is AMAZING, the service is great, there are TV's everywhere playing the local sports, and a fantastic bar area. I usually get the ""chicken crispers"" which are these amazing chicken fingers with an EXTREMELY crispy, shell-like breading, and a succulent meaty inside, that probably makes them the greatest food I have ever eaten. They have so many other foods too, lots of them having an American-southwest theme. They have SO MANY other additions to the restaurant, including these little-tablet things at every table called a ""ziosk"" where kids can play games and do activities, and you can even pay with it, having a card swiping area and a slot for the receipt to come out! PLEASE consider eating here. It is so great, and all those haters giving bad reviews for this restaurant clearly don't know what they are talking about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2
Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",159,857,3017,1.0,11/13/2017,"Its Chilis... You know what to expect when you get there...  But this was just bad... Got there around 730 on a Saturday and the place was DEAD, but yet we had to wait 20 mins to be seated (because they didnt have enough staff - but really 20 mins and there were maybe 6 tables seated)  So we are finally seated & then have to wait 20 mins for a drink order.  So you can already guess how the pace of the night went.  She tried to be overly nice but at that point it was all just fake as there was NO HUSTLE to her and she was just soo laid back & not caring about service.  Food was Blah, Things were wrong,  Tasty yes, because we like Chili's food, just everything else was Shitty...  Prob wont stop here again anytime soon!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2
Ian G.,"Lynn, MA",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,Went today for lunch. My 7 year old ordered mini burgers and she was served her burgers on moldy bread. We showed who I assume was the manager and she could've cared less. Just told us she doesn't understand how that could've happened. Then after we gave the waitress the cash to pay she sends another waitress over with our change. She was our waitress and couldn't even take 30 seconds to bring us change and say thank you. Needless to say don't think we'll be back anytime soon,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2
Glenn C.,"Wakefield, MA",0,3,,1.0,10/14/2017,"We arrived at 8pm and more than half the restaurant was empty, 20-30 min wait.  Finally seated no drinks for 20 min, food came out awful returned half of it.  I mean they couldn't make Mac and cheese right.   Service was awful waiter disappeared for 20 min at a time with us waiting for bill and Pepsi refills.

J D.,"Arlington, MA",0,10,,1.0,10/1/2017,"We have come to this location a number of times.  The quality of food has gone down.  Not coming back. Sunday night, half empty parking lot, lots of empty tables. 15-20 min wait, only one couple in front.  You know they are understaffed! The Tex Mex prime rib bowl is gone, so we order salmon. We specify *well done* for salmon.  Comes out undercooked.  Broccoli is undercooked, tastes raw, like cellar taste.  Manager comes over, offers to either cook it more, or new meal.  We opt for new meal.  Should have switched to something else. Now the salmon is well done, broccoli is still way underdone.  Sorry, I don't enjoy dry undercooked broccoli. And the ziosk is a total ripoff- calculating tip on original + replacement meals.  We are done with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2

Jennifer R.,"Danvers, MA",56,329,25,1.0,8/23/2017,"For a chain restaurant chilis has always been one of my favorites, I must say this location has ruined that. Service is ALWAYS horrible! My mother daughter and I went in yesterday for lunch and it truly felt like we were inconveniencing the staff by showing up! They open at 11 we got there around 1150 but still they made us feel as though they weren't ready for patrons. My soup was cold (so cold that the shredded cheese on top of the chicken tortilla soup did not even melt). food was greasy. My mom has a food allergy that they could care less about. We won't be back, at least not to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2

Ben L.,"Dallas, TX",1,11,1,2.0,11/8/2016,"Went into this Chili's after a long day, was served by Joshua. ordered a steak medium well, had it come out practically fully cooked on a sizzling skillet(?? it's not fajita meat) without any fries. When i asked about the fries, Joshua lied about it and said they were cooking them and they would be out shortly. cut to 10 minutes later, after both me and my coworker had finished, the fries still hadn't appeared, despite having to listen to Joshua jaw about his sex life with the BOH staff(thanks for that dude). we paid for the check and left.  ++ decent drinks and cheap food ---Resturant staff that don't know their own menu or how to act in public",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2

I came here on a busy Saturday night with a friend for her birthday, our waitress (Jordan was her name I think) was super friendly. I got the spicy Pasilla chicken with quinoa salad from the ""healthy"" menu (even though there were only a few options, I appreciated them) the food was good.

Alexice B.,"Beverly, MA",0,2,,1.0,8/13/2016,"HORRENDOUS!!!!!! Wish I could do negative stars, I would! Margaritas are 99% ice and 10 bucks a piece, tables are so sticky you can't even put your arm down on them and food was microwaved and disgusting!!!!!! Waitress was also horrid and rude and inattentive.

Gross!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2
Alexa G.,"Boston, MA",219,36,12,1.0,11/19/2016,"First of all, I've been to multiple Chili's locations and they've been typically pleasant. This location, I don't even know where to start. We walked in and asked for an open table inside the bar area. We were greeted after sitting there for 10 minutes by a snippy waitress. My boyfriend ordered the Classic Patron Margarita and I ordered the Strawberry Patron Margarita as well as our waters with lemon. The waters both came out without lemons and the margaritas had too much purée and it consisted of mostly ice. By each sip, I questioned if there was actually any alcohol in them. Our appetizer came out- the White Spinach Queso with chips. There wasn't enough queso for a baby to eat but certainly not for an appetizer or how many chips they gave you- which was heaping over the plate while the dip only barely covered one layer of the skillet. My boyfriend ordered the Dr. Pepper BBQ and Craft BBQ ribs with the two set sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli. It came and was suppose to be topped with cilantro but never actually got it and the broccoli was freezing cold. I ordered the fajitas since on the cover of the menu it said ""We practically discovered the fajita and now we're making it even better."" I tried to order the hard shell tacos and my waitress- Joselina- practically shouted ""they're gross. They are too hard and just disgusting."" So, I said okay, I'll go with the soft shell with chicken and shrimp. It came on a sizzling skillet with a small side plate with the soft shells in aluminum foil. Not sure why it was in aluminum foil because they were cold. The peppers and ""caramelized"" onions had to be peeled off the skillet and my ""onions"" were actually onion peels. They gave me barely any pico de gayo and the guacamole tasted like it had bee left out for a while and most definitely not fresh. The waitress never took anything off the table after we tried to tell her we were all set with everything and said ""I'll take it later"" including our first rounds of water glasses after ordering the second round. Never asked if we needed anything, never had silverware until we asked for it, never got my boyfriend napkins after he ordered ribs! Never even asked if we wanted another Margarita! We were going to  order dessert but didn't want to have a bad experience with that too. Now heading to a business that deserves our money for something sweet. WORST experience ever.  Also, get rid of the bags that hold the silverware- they're useless and are not environmentally friendly. Wrap them in napkins like a normal restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2
Maggie W.,"Brookline, MA",17,147,247,2.0,4/22/2016,"We came in around 630 on a Thursday night. Quite a few empty tables. It took a long time for a waiter to come to our table. I had to request a waiter from another waiter to get someone to take our order. The drinks took a while to come out. The food was not great. The onion rings app was meh... The batter wasn't very good. The baby back ribs were terrible...  Not tender at all and the taste was off putting. The shrimp and prime rib fajitas weren't bad. The shrimp was super salty though. The prime rib bites were tender so that was nice. The molten lava cake... I love it. It was the best part of the meal. Again, the waiter was barely around and I always had to flag down another waiter to get her. I was not happy with the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2
Johnny F.,"Houlton, ME",5,171,102,4.0,4/25/2015,"Just what I expect when I go to a chain restaurant.  I must say that I have not been to  Chili's in some time so I was surprised by all the new menu items.

Brown I'd G.,"Amesbury, MA",32,39,5,2.0,9/18/2016,"I'm giving this location two stars because our would be server was a passive aggressive douche on the way out.  My sister an I came in for a special offer and we couldn't remember if it was in the restaurant or in the bar only.  It turned out that it was a bar special only.  We had been seated in the dining area and apologized to our would be server that we would be moving to the bar.  She said that was okay, etc.  At the end of our dining experience, I passed said server on the way to the restroom and she loudly muttered while looking at me, ""hey, maybe now I'll make some money."" Then when I exited the restroom, she was there again to give me a dirty look.  Needless to say, this location gets a big thumbs down.  If money is what you're after, you may want to try getting a better job and attitude adjustment while you're at it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2

Jeff S.,"Saugus, MA",2,4,,1.0,6/11/2016,"Will never come here again. From the slow service, to a waitress complaining about not getting tipped (she said even though she was actually nice to them still no tip), to the same waitress dropping clean silverware on the floor then picking it up and putting it on a freshly bussed table, to the super salted burgers that can only mean they are hiding the taste of old meat, to the bartender fishing the orange slice out of my blue moon with her fingers to move it to the side of the glass- this was the worst experience I've had in about 3 years. I'm not hard to please. I know it's a chain. Not looking for gourmet, just looking to leave with my stomach full and have a waitress notice when my glass has been empty for 10 minutes.

Anonymous P.,"Ipswich, MA",0,1,,1.0,11/5/2016,"If possible I'd rank it as a zero. I told my husband a few visits ago that I don't like to east here.  The food quality is horrible, the service is a joke and it needs a good cleaning. After today my husband finally agreed with me. I ordered a rib eye that had mashed potatoes and broccoli served with it. My husband ordered a dish and rice and beans, my girls ordered sliders with fries. My meal cane out Luke warm and the rib eye was med/well even though I ordered it med/rare, plus it had fries, not mashed potatoes. The server didn't bring the food, which was fine, he didn't ask how things were for 15 minutes. My husband had to ask for his rice and beans, which took an additional 10 minutes. I asked if mine was supposed to have mashed potatoes, not fries. Josh, our server, said yes and they'd be right out.  Never got the potatos, my hub's meal was cold and my kids burgers were dripping grease. The bill was just under $62, that was with 3 drinks,1 water, no boot or appetizers. The only time the waiter came back was once we finally flagged him down for the check and to get out of there.  It was a horrible meal, sub-par service and I will never eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20
Alyssa G.,"Danvers, MA",117,39,3,1.0,3/1/2016,"Went into the Chili's tonight with a few friends and I will tell you now I will never step into a chili's again. 1) Took almost 5 minutes to be greeted, which doesn't seem like a big deal, expect I was starving. 2) Our appetizer took almost 40 minutes, we were done and ready for another round of drinks before the waitress even came back. 3) The waitress did less than the bare minimum. Other servers were running circles around her. She came to our table a total of 4 times the ENTIRE meal. Never asked us how anything was, and we had to ask for everything we needed. 4) None of our food came out like it was supposed to. Our steak was supposed to be medium, came out well done. Our quesadilla came with NO CHICKEN... Just a pinch of bacon and barely any cheese. Our fajitas were supposed to come with lettuce and salsa and none of that showed up. 5) When we asked for a new quesadilla it honestly looked like just threw some chicken and a little more cheese and refried it instead of making a new one.  6) The manager barely acknowledged that we were upset. He didn't do anything to make us feel better about the situation and honestly made us feel like our opinion doesn't matter.  Honestly the only blessing was the margaritas. Even with those I couldn't handle how horrible this experience was. Sorry Chili's, 6 strikes and your out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20

Brian T.,"Lynnfield, MA",0,30,3,5.0,9/1/2015,"My fiancé and I went here a week and a half ago. We were at the bar. Our bartender ""Kevin"" was amazing. We always had a full drink and everything we needed. He made us feel important. We also noticed it was not just towards us but everyone at the bar. Kevin was nice, welcoming, and on point. I would love to go back to chili' because of ""Kevin""  We eat out a lot and he is one of the few great ones.  P.s. The manager was also awesome after we heard he was in the back covering for the cook who didn't show up. The food was good too. Kevin apologized for the food coming out a little late but we didn't care because the service was awesome.  Thank you",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20

C L.,"Dorchester, MA",0,4,,1.0,1/18/2016,"The only reason I would even give this a single star is that the waitress was pleasant and efficient.  It was freezing in there (which she acknowledged).  She said she would ask the manager to turn up the heat (I swear it wasn't even on and it's 19 degrees here).  Apparently he's more concerned with the heating costs than with people actually being able to eat with their coats off.  (Yes, all the women I saw had their coats still on while attempting to eat their meal.)  On to the food:  The bottom half of my pretzel roll was rock hard.  The french fries were barely warm.  Son ordered a Mexican combo (4 items) and said the only thing on the plate halfway decent was the black beans.  The waitress didn't come back to ask if everything was okay and we had gone there because the power was out in our house.  So we ate what we could and paid the bill.

Jan B.,"Lowell, MA",0,15,,3.0,4/2/2015,"I have never been to Chili's before, fearing it was too spicy for me (the logo has a hot pepper on it after all). And this despite the fact there is a branch about 2 miles down the street I live on. I finally stopped into the Danvers branch today because a friend had a gift card and wanted to treat me to lunch. All in all, I was impressed. The waitress was very pleasant and helpful. The food came quickly (perhaps too quickly...see below), and my meal was very nice. I started with a ""house side salad"" which was practically a meal in itself and very fresh. This was followed by a Margharita flatbread, which was delicious. Now obviously my choices were not ""tex-mex"" but they were very good. My partner for lunch, however, was disappointed with her meal. She ordered the ""smoked bone in wings"" and a salad for lunch. The wings were on the menu as ""Bone-in wings slow smoked in house over pecan wood. Served with Chili's classic BBQ sauce"". The wings were not smoked, they were deep fat fried and had absolutely no seasoning on them at all, let alone the ""smoked"" seasoning promised. And the ""classic BBQ sauce"" was plain old ketchup with no BBQ taste whatsoever.  There were very few customers in the restaurant, so there was no real reason to take a shortcut and fry the wings. So, a mixed review: my lunch was excellent, my companion's was not at all as advertised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20

Marissa M.,"Middleborough, MA",0,3,,1.0,4/29/2016,"I came in here for dinner with my boyfriend and son after a day at the water park and I was highly disappointed. We both ordered chicken fajitas and while making a fajita I noticed what looked like black mold in my cheese. I brought to my waitresses attention she handled it properly. Then the ""manager"" come strolling over, doesn't introduce himself just goes right into how he ""just wanted to let us know the cheese is a three way mix with jalapeño cheese being one and it has green and red spots."" I replied "" green and red?"" He said ""yes."" I then went on to say ""okay, but the spots were black in the cheese."" He stood over us and continued to argue for at least another minute with me until I told him ""he can proceed away as I'm not going to sit here and argue with him."" And put my arm in the go away motion. He looked at me for a moment and walked away. Never apologized, never introduced himself, never cared about his customer. I will call corporate on him as well. I asked my waitress for his name and asked his position. Apparently Gary is the ""managers"" name that doesn't even care about his customers.

Bad decision altogether!  We were given 25 minutes but waited 45 when noticed there was some tables available but not cleaned up, we approached the host to speak about our concern, instead listen and go check why nobody was cleaning the tables, he responded back to us claiming the 30 minutes had not expired yet. 2 minutes later, he went to clean the table himself, after that our food took forever to come, to the point when we started noticing people that had been seated after us were already leaving and our food --nothing--!! When we asked our waitress, instead go check on the status of our food, he said: Oh I don't cook! I just bring the food out, I DO NOT COOK! The food took forever and then came out dry and tasteless.

Sha D.,"Medford, MA",0,149,,2.0,10/6/2014,"Normally I like Chilli's. But this one is pretty bad. My friends and I came in around ten p.m. to take advantage of happy hour & needless to say our hour here wasn't so happy.  I think who ever was working in the kitchen that night had to have been drunk, because everyones food was messed up in some way. We started off with four appetizers(bottomless chips&salsa, potato skins, burger sliders, and classic nachos.) The potato skins were burnt, the nachos were missing beans, and the sliders only came with cheese when they were supposed to come with onion and bacon. Our waitress offered to re-make the sliders, and the new order came out finally came out ten minutes before they closed. Atleast the chips and salsa were good, but we devoured them in less than two minutes and were never offered a re-fill. The manager took the potato skins and sliders off of our bill, which was nice. The original chicken crispers that I got for my meal made me confused. I have gotten the same thing at other Chillis and these were just different. The batter had a different texture and kept falling off the chicken. Also my fries were completely unseasoned.

Dustin N.,"Peabody, MA",3,26,,1.0,1/30/2012,"Hadn't been here in somewhere around 5 years.. I vaguely remembered not liking it and that being the reason for not being there in so long (but eating at Fridays right across the road numerous times) but I wasn't totally sure so decided to give it a whirl. First thing we see when we walk in is a drunk man slightly aide stepping out of the bar area cursing to himself... Ok weird (its thursday at 7pm). Then there's more drunk guys still at the bar. Wouldn't think this as a ""bar hangout"". So we are seated quickly and the waitress came over rapidly. And took our drink order. 2 margaritas... Now I realize we aren't in a place expected tp have the beat margaritas... But I should have just ordered blended ice with lime juice. It was extremely sour and I'm almost positive an eye droplets worth of tequila. At this point I take a bathroom break, and now the bathroom isn't necessarily dirty but is definatly in need of an annual scrubbing to ride the floor of the buildup of grime (mold?) On the floor around the sinks and under the paper towel dispenser.  So now put food shows up. My girlfriend got a chicken that they absolutlu drowned in a sauce. It came with corn on the cob that was so mushy it fell apart when she picked it up and french fries that were decent (gotta earn that half a star somewhere)  My burger wasn't terrible... But I would be able to get a better one basically anywhere else.  As for the staff. They were all very nice from hostess to waitress and even who I assume to br a manager of some sort who brought our food out. (There's your other half star)  Needless to say I remember why I stopped going there and I'm not gonna forget this time around. Peace out chili's. Its been real... I guess i hate giving bad reviews... but it is what it is. a lot of people i know like it here but its definatly not for me. i would prefer fridays across the street any day, its cleaner better food and drinks and just a better layout",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20

It was a beautiful quiet Monday evening with two people eating at the otherwise of the restaurant and a somewhat decent crowd hanging at the bar side. We sat there for 10 minutes as waitresses and waiters passed by and gave us eye contact, and not a single one came up to us. 10 minutes passed by and we decided to get up and leave. I could have called a waiter over but why should that be my responsibility if I'm going to pay them at the end of a meal and forced to be generous and tip? Not a single way did I want to call them over. So the 15 minute mark came by and we decided to leave the menu on the table and leave. Sorry not sorry, not coming back. Thanks chilis you've been the best at slow restaurant service on a slow day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20
Miss T.,"Salem, MA",14,254,12,4.0,6/27/2011,The new menu & the food was great!  The place is very clean & quiet.   The staff has to converse away from the customers especially if talking about them or about a conflict. Didn't find that too impressive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20
J P.,"Beverly, MA",17,167,159,4.0,1/8/2014,Stopped in tonight for dinner and drinks. Our waitress Kelly was very attentive and friendly. We had the blackberry patron margarita which was awesome.

Justin S.,"Peabody, MA",7,36,,2.0,6/8/2012,"The first time I ever came here was absolutely terrible. Took forever to be seated in spite of the fact that nobody else was waiting ahead of us, and there were plenty of open tables. Waitress took forever to do anything, starting with taking 15 minutes to come get our drink order. Food came out cold. Waitress brought the wrong check over when we were done. A catastrophic failure, all around. Over a year later, I decide to give this place a second chance. I will say the service was MUCH better, though, in my opinion, still only qualified as ""adequate"". The men's room, however, was a disaster. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Overall, they seem to be doing better than my first visit, but still not well enough to merit regular return visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40

MIss E.,"Lynn, MA",0,13,,1.0,5/20/2009,This place totally blows. I went here for lunch with my boyfriend and mother because we were absolutely starving and wanted something quick and cheap.  We got sat right away which was nice and the waitress came right over and took our drink order. About 10 minutes later still no beer or coffee. Finally my boyfriend got his beer and my mother got her coffee but I still had to wait because the waitress spilled mine. When she did bring it over she spilled it AGAIN and didn't even help clean it up! She also didn't bring cream or a spoon and it was pretty much cold.  After we got our drinks we had to wait about 45 minutes for our food and noticed that the TWO tables (not just one) that were sat much much later than us had both received appetizers and their meals. Apparently our waitress was so busy waiting on everyone else she forgot about us and by the time some random waiter brought our food over it was cold. When we sent one dish back we could tell all they did was microwave it because the plate was hotter than the food. If you want to eat here plan on having crappy service and waiting a while for your food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40
Amy C.,"Peabody, MA",0,2,,1.0,3/22/2013,"I went to Chili's in Danvers on March 22, 2013.  When I first walked in I noticed a foul odor.   But I was there to meet a  friend and didn't want to disrupt my meeting with her so I went in anyway.    I was there for about an hour.   The entire time I was there the place smelled foul -- like a room that hadn't been cleaned well in a very long time.   It was really gross.   I couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from.   I suspect lack of cleanliness in and around the seats and  tables was the problem.    I didn't eat much of my lunch.   The smell was so unappetizing.   I didn't want to eat anything.  Really gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40

Chris V.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",435,134,596,3.0,11/19/2008,"Ok so I'm giving this Chili's 3 stars because it's a Chili's. That being said, the service is great at this location. This is a particularly good Chili in my experience with the chain. BUT, it's still a Chili's and overall it's A-OK for a chain! -- One downside is they close way to early, around 11pm most nights which forces me and my friends to go to Friday's on the other side of the highway instead (We like Chili's better). --- As far as food Chili's is definitely good, much better than Fridays and Applebee's. This Chili's is small - which I actually like it has more of a laid back atmosphere in the bar area. The waiters and waitresses are awesome - really nice, down to earth, personable and remember your drinks if you come enough lol.  Overall if you want a crazy exciting bar I would go some where else but if you and a few friends want to hang out, talk, grab some food and watch the game this is a good place.  My App Picks: Triple Dipper, Boneless Buffalo, **Salsa and Chips (or Queso!) My Dinner Picks: Country Fried Chicken Crisper's, Burger Bites.  My Dessert Picks: Chocolate Chip Molten Cake  - **not amazing but still addictive  - (also I saw the ""alcohol"" portion of the survey on this review and it says ""Alcohol: NONE (3 votes)"". I think they advertise their margaritas and drinks more than their food. The official name of this resturant is ""Chili's Grill and BAR"" So if your wondering - yes there is a full bar here)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40
Lillian W.,"Boston, MA",18,41,1,2.0,1/6/2008,"Oh dear.  I really hope Chili's was just having a bad night. I made my first visit to Chili's with three of my friends earlier tonight...just might be our last. We were seated promptly, as it was a Sunday just before 6pm.  I was already turned off because the hostess was fumbling to organize the sugar packets on the table and then I noticed there was water all under our table like there was a spill and no one mopped it up--but I didn't say anything because I figured no one else cared.  So, yes.  Seated and got menus.  And nothing. So after about 12 minutes I went to a hostess and told her we had been waiting for about 12 minutes (yes, to be annoying I said 12.  Not 10, not 15, 12) and we had not seen our waiter.  She just told me ""Oh she'll be right with you"" and that's it.  She didn't even find someone... just went back to the host stand.  Our waiter finally arrived in a frenzy and asked us what we wanted.  It was quite awkward because at that point the service delivery process was all screwed up, so we weren't sure if we were ordering drinks...meals... both?  Both.  She was nice and apologetic but that really did not resolve anything. Our drinks came, got refills before our food came since I inhaled my lemonade, then our food came.  I shared an appetizer (the triple dipper, you choose three) because I had a late lunch.  I love Spinach and Artichoke dip--until I am casually snacking and all of a sudden a part of my mouth and throat start burning.  Not sure what it was... a pepper or chili of some sort... but it definitely did not belong in the dip!  I was not happy.   The waitress did not check back on us to see if we needed more refills... that was annoying because we all had finished out drinks and were trying to finish our meals.  Of course the waitress showed up when we were basically done, told us she's running all over the place because she was given too many tables blar blar and then got us refills and at that point we asked for the check.   We paid and got the heck out of there.   Seriously, Chili's?  What's going on? I may never come back to try those famous Chili's baby back ribs. ...barbeque sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40
Michael S.,"Beverly, MA",3,23,,2.0,3/22/2010,"My wife and I ate here this past Friday, for a night out without our three week year old son. We seem to find our way back here every six months or so and are always reminded why we swore we would not come back again.  My wife ordered a buffalo chicken salad, and I ordered the crispy chicken platter, and as an appetizer we shared the Texas cheese fries(half order)  The Cheese fries were ok but some of the cheese on it was cold, this may have been because we are fairly certain our waitress forgot to put the order in and when we asked about it she ran back to take care of it.  My wife was not impressed by her salad, she said it looked good in the picture but really was just a salad with to much dressing.  I enjoyed my chicken fingers, I did not enjoy the soggy fries that came with it, or the corn that was probably picked 6 months ago and then frozen.  Finally the service was awful, and I really do not understand why, she only had two tables and kept forgetting things, getting refills was nearly impossible, needless to say we left a very small tip. I would not recommend going here for dinner, hopefully I will take my own advice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40

sal a.,"Medford, MA",3,20,3,1.0,4/18/2009,"Let me start by saying I've always had a pleasant experience at the Chili's in Burlington.  It's certainly not gourmet, but great for what it is.   My experience at the Danvers location threw me for a loop.  It looks the same from the outside, especially at night, but the moment you step inside you know you really shouldn't have, but it's already too late.  Something wasn't right about this place. Why do we always get seated near restrooms, the kitchen, or the service area?  The place was half empty!  I'm not one to complain (unless it's here on yelp), but maybe I should from now on. My wife took the ugly view, which included all three of the above, if you can believe that.  She had to stare at an overly stuffed wastebasket under the service area, servers biting their fingernails complaining about their schedules, while having a clear view of the kitchen and restrooms just 5 feet away.  You lost us Chili's Danvers.   It wasn't a total disaster.  Our cheeseburgers were tasty, but the fries were very mealy, and our boneless buffalo strips were more like popcorn buffalo pieces.  The bottomless soft drinks were marked incorrectly on their menu.  It should have read watered down bottomless soft drinks.  I hate when restaurants do that.  One of the staff started sweeping the floor very close to our feet while we were trying to eat, making a banging sound when the broom would hit the dustpan.  Not good.  Not good.   Oh, almost forgot, the men's restroom needed to be cleaned and the women's restroom smelled like urine.  I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried.  Don't believe me?  They've got plenty of seating available if you'd like to check them out. And Chili's Danvers, we understand why your location is half empty.  Why doesn't the general manager or his/her boss see what we saw?  Matter of fact, we didn't see any manager types during our visit, just teenagers running the show.  That'll grow your business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40

Nick O.,"Boston, MA",0,12,,1.0,11/16/2008,"Due to the fact that I get out of work late, I typically have to go out to eat late. I called Chilis and asked what time the KITCHEN closed and they told me midnight, So I had no problem leaving work and heading over. We get there at 11:30 and we are seated and we order beers and an app. The beers come a few minutes later then the app. Fast forward to 11:50 at this point my beer was empty for like 8 minutes and the waitress was like ignoring me, as if she didnt want to serve me another beer. The food comes out and the waitress says ""Do you want a coke or something?"" I was like no thanks I will just take another beer... She tells me sorry but we are closed now she said everything including the bar closes at 11:45, She would only serve me a soda... Ok whatever, if I can't enjoy a beer with my meal then I guess I'll take a spite. (PS Thanks for ignoring me) So we are eating our meal and drinking our sodas, and all of a sudden the music is turned off, then the TVs were turned off and then the lights... we literally had our meals on the table for like 3 minutes and they start turning off all this stuff. It was 12:02 when they did all this, I would never of gone here if they didnt say the kitchen was open til midnite....              Long story short, won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40
Rich G.,"Peabody, MA",0,13,,1.0,11/12/2009,"This review is based on 2 visits. I went here for dinner several months ago and got the steak fajitas. I doubt that the beef was of very good quality (it seemed more like the ""beef product"" one finds in frozen dinners), but it was tender and flavorful and seved hot. Price was good and we got lots of food. On the lunch visit yesterday we got the '3 for $20' special. For an appetizer we got the Texas fries, which were served promptly and were hot and tasty enough. For entrees we got a burger and Chicken Quesadillas. The burger was ordered medium but arrived well-done AND lukewarm. If you're going to overcook something shouldn't it at least be hot? The quesadillas and the accompanying fries and mashed potatoes also arrived overcooked and luke-effing-warm. I want my friggin food hot. Why the hell is that too much to ask at so many restaurants??? For dessert we got the Molten Chocolate Cake. This took a while to arrive, and when it did it came with a rock-solid ball of ice cream on top. Trying to scoop a piece of ice cream with a spoon resulted in the ice cream being pushed straight through the chocolate cake to the bottom of the plate, with nary a dent in the ice cream. I sawed the blob of ice cream in half with a steak knife just to facilitate melting. I was going to give this place 2 stars, but I'm going back and changing it to one star. There are a multitiude of better places to eat. You're better off eating at home or not eating at all than eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40
