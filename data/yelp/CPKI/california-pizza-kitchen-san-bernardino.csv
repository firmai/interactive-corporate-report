Kirari S.,"Colton, CA",303,181,691,4.0,1/23/2010,"The last time I was at CPK...ok well the last 2 times I had great times with friends. So looking at the food wasn't really a factor (esp when you're drinking.)  It's also been a while since I been to one, the LAST time I was at a CPK was in L.A. during AX09.  How did I end up going to one this time? Well I really wanted some Red Velvet Cake, and since I live no where near a cafe or bakery, I had to Yelp ""Red velvet cake"" and CPK was on the list. So my sister was hungry and I suggested CPK (yes because I wanted the RVC) and she agreed. It wasn't very busy so when we walked in we were greeted and shown to our table immediately. Our waitress was really lovely too. She let us know about the free wine tasting they were doing, so of course I did it. The red wine was really good, unfortunately for the me and the rest of you, I can't remember the name of it but it was a Cabernet.  With such a huge menu it took a while to decide what I should order. I've had a piece of the California club pizza and it's not very good. I actually gave it back to my friend who ordered it (my slice.) I've had their pasta's and they are good. CPK isn't just for pizza but for pasta too. And not just pasta but for sandwiches.  I ended up ordering the Veggie Sandwich that has roasted red/yellow peppers, sauted portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce and sun dried tomato aioli sauce all on a foccacia bread. To my surprise it is really good! I mean really! If you're not one for veggie sandwiches, just try this one, it's not a miss, but a HIT. With it I ordered the Caesar salad, it's a caesar salad... not much to say about that to be honest. The waitress was kind enough to box the second half of my sandwich too. Which by the way, when you take out the lettuce and tomato and pop it in the microwave for about 35-40 seconds and slap them back on, the sandwich is still good! Now for the main reason I came to this place that night, the Red Velvet Cake. Now for $6.95 I was thinking, ""this cake better be good... -_-"" When I ordered it the waitress asked me if I wanted ice cream with it and of course I did, but most places have it come with it, not separately.  But when the cake arrived, it was huge and looked really delicious! Even though the ice cream melted on the way, the presentation was nice to say the least.  When I took my fork and stuck it in the cake and took that bite, to my surprise it was moist and not dry like most. The filling and frosting was pretty good too. Good enough that my sister, who doesn't even like cakes, took a few, not a couple, a few bites because it was good to her.  If you live in the Inland Empire and are looking for some good Red Velvet cake, while $7 for a piece is pricey, think of it this way. If you go to a place that is farther, you're paying more to go to that place that is about 20+ minutes away for a piece of RVC that you could have for less than half of what you'd pay for gas to get to that distant bakery. Is this the best in the I.E.? I can't say it is, only because I've only had RVC in the form of cupcakes here in the I.E.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
John L.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",118,914,2,3.0,10/11/2008,It's the usual CPK. Nothing out of the extraordinary but also consistent and decent food. They seemed to be a bit understaffed when they first opened but I think things have stabilized. It is definitely nice to have around the area for large birthday parties and other celebrations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
Bob C.,"CA, CA",132,755,415,3.0,1/3/2009,"After making my way over to Papaya Bay and finding out they were closed (I may have actually screamed NOOOOOO!!!! when I saw it was all dark like and I'm still holding out hope that it was just happened to be closed early on a friday night...), we drove around the myriad of chain restaurants 'round Hospitality and finally settled on CPK.   Needless to say, one CPK is like another, except for the strangest thing here.  No one seemed to know that a CPK was here.  No wait, nigh empty, understaffed.  I've gotten used to Victoria Gardens own 15-20 min late dinner wait time and I don't ever remember seeing a CPK as dead as this one was. Food wise, I had just recently (like 2 days prior) had CPK's BBQ Chicken (always a winner), Garlic Chicken (gotta love all that garlic eh?), and Sicilian (yummers), so we opted for other items on the menu: I didn't find the appetizer (Singapore Spring Rolls), salads (Waldorf Chicken Salad & Miso Seafood Salad) or pizzas (Mango Tandoori Chicken, Pear & Gorgonzola, & Thai Chicken) to be repeaters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
Av A.,"San Francisco, CA",156,310,51,2.0,5/13/2009,"Imagine walking into this place with 9 of your friends early Saturday evening, ready as ever to gorge on some good pizza since your last meal that day was fast food. Imagine seeing 3 employees behind a counter 20ft away who looks at your group, then goes back to what they were doing [they were hosts/waiters], almost making you doubt they even acknowledged your presence. Imagine waiting 15 fucking minutes, all the while witnessing at least 4 other employees walking around a HALF EMPTY dining area, not knowing what the fuck the next thing to do is, then looking at your group as if acknowledging your party is equal to being given a task to diffuse a bomb. I think I gave the stink eye to the big dude that looked important, and he finally came to us and said our table will be ready in a few minutes. Our server Amanda, was great and very accommodating. I get the whole preparing our table deal, but seriously you should get into the habit of having the professional mannerism to welcome a big group of hungry customers and not have them wait cluelessly for 15+ minutes at your waiting area.. that's just RUDE my friend. The food was good but their initial service left a lingering bad taste in my mouth. Go figure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
Abe F.,"Moreno Valley, CA",233,124,12,3.0,8/9/2008,"Growing up in Loma Linda, I never thought that there would be a CPK just minutes away.  But now, thanks to the new revitalization of Hospitality Lane, SB can now claim their own CPK and other similar type chains. CPK has generally good, tasty food.  This one just seemed to be a bit understaffed tonight or perhaps just overwhelmed by the number of large parties that were being served.  Service was ok, but not the most attentive.  Anyway, it's a good thing that CPK is here since now San Berdo-ers can have access to the wonderful varieties of pizza that CPK churns out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
James S.,"San Jose, CA",8,123,1,4.0,1/3/2009,"Wow... so little love of the CPK here in the Inland Empire. I suppose it's not the CPK, it's the staff and location of this particular CPK. If you've never been to a CPK, be prepared for a ""trendy"" menu with a few crazy pizzas. They have a selection of ""normal"" pizzas for those who are faint-of-heart. But for the true CPK experience, be sure to order your pizza ""neapolitan style"" which is a fancy way of saying super-thin crust. The thin-crust style is their bread-and-butter and they do a pretty good job at it. Less-thin crust pizzas are still good, but nothing special. They also have a variety of non-pizza items such as pasta, salads, etc. Most of them are pretty good, especially for a pizza joint. If you like to gourge yourself with 17 slices of pizza, this is not the right place for you. Pizzas are a bit on the small side, but certainly enough for the average person. Salads are generous (particular the full-sized ones). Some appetizers are a bit skimpy, but usually worth it. The eggrolls come to mind. Clean, easy access, and good food. The service is wanting at times, but certainly no worse than average (which I pretty much consider average to be self-service these days). This part of San Bernardino has been revitalized so it seems safe. Just don't stray too far from the shopping complex.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
Ryan B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",13,73,5,4.0,9/23/2010,"I love their wasabi pizza.  It's spicy but not ""make my eyes water"" spicy.  It has just the right amount of kick and flavor to make it a must try.  I always try to take some home with me for those late night cravings.  I've never had any complaint with the service so by and large it has always been a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
Jill H.,"Alhambra, CA",0,2,,4.0,6/2/2010,"I've been craving the buffalo chicken pizza since the last time I was at a CPK. So the BF & I went on Monday. We ordered Togo from the online menu. When we went to pick it up, it was kinda confusing who was helping us. All in all food was Yummy!! I love the red velvet cake. My BF loved it, but it didn't agree with his stomach.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
Ari g.,"Arcata, CA",63,36,2,3.0,12/6/2008,"I've never been to a CPK but my fiancee has heard they are good. We went with my dad and step-mom one afternoon. They have an admirable beer selection I had noted. When I ordered a pint I got carded, naturally. As I handed over my ID, I made a little joke about it all and the waitress was kinda snooty about it. But she was put in her place when she noticed that I was older than her. I just don't look all that old I s'ppose. The pizzas were decent. I recommend the wild mushrooms and the Japanese eggplant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-bernardino
