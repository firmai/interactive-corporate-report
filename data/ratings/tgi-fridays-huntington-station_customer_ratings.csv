20,AJ P.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,68,12.0,1.0,2012-09-16,Disgusting stinky filthy place.  I don't know how it stays in business. Food sucks too.  Service is ok. It is the epitome of how bad a chain restaurant can get.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=40,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003
28,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",368,1402,155.0,2.0,2012-10-29,"I've never been a fan of Friday's.  When it comes to chain restaurants, I usually prefer Applebee's.  But it was a Friday night, my coworkers and I had had a long work week, and we decided to take advantage of Friday's happy hour. It wasn't very crowded when we arrived, which was nice, minus the screaming baby.  We were quickly seated by the bar and given menus, one menu was a ""drinks bible"".  Two coworkers got the pomegranate margaritas, one got a pina colada, and I got a beer (because I don't drink anything girly, sorry).  They said their drinks were good and you can't really judge a beer.  We decided to have appetizers, thinking they were half-price since ya know, it was happy hour.  Our waitress disappeared for a good half hour after giving us our drinks and by the time she came back around, we were onto our next drink.   We asked if the apps were half-price, she said no.  Okay, why not?  Then she proceeded to show us the 2 for $10 deal.  Uh...Nope.  We ordered apps, anyway.  The apps were good enough for chain restaurant food.  The prices for happy hour were decent but still $8 for a fruity drink and no discounts on beer unless it was Bud, Bud Light, and a full assortment of crappy beer that people with no palate usually drink.   Overall, it's still Friday's and it still sucks. But I suppose I would stop by again one night after work just because of the convenience to my office.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001

But wait!  There is more!!  They have upgraded their taps, and now serve craft beer.  What a solid move.  Very easy way to get a guy like me to head over there for a quick lunch.  The same guys that distribute Bud and Coors distribute the good stuff - bully to Fridays for manning up and getting Dogfish Head.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002

Keep in mind this review has nothing to do with the quality of the food - it's a Friday's, and it's as Friday's as Friday's come.  If you like the flat breads at another Friday's, you'll probably like the Flatbreads here.   The Korean Tacos were good. But the service, I mean, wow - with every drink order we had to wait an inordinate amount of time to see said drink order.  The place wasn't even that crowded.  Someone asked for cocktail sauce for their shrimp - it never came, until it was re-requested.  Then it came...eventually.   Really bad service.  No excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

Anyway, the only thing I REALLY like at TGI Friday's is the Jack Daniels menu (seriously, that sauce is addicting).  I ordered the steak and shrimp and it hit the spot. Washed it down with a Strawberry Daiquiri and all was well in the world.  I was trying to avoid Friday westbound traffic on the LIE so I went there pretty early to kill time...like 5:30pm or so.

I liked the atmosphere and the decor is Americana...It can get kinda loud but i actually like that because i hate to whisper over dinner. I had the jack daniels chicken and cajun shrimp....i have to say i thought the serving size was the kids plate.. or the plate was massive and the 8 cajun shrimp and the tiny chicken breast  got lost in it. I ordered lime slaw but it came in a tiny dixie cup size container ..guess i expected more.

19,James B.,"Melville, NY",3,11,6.0,4.0,2014-05-16,"I really hate to admit it, but I think that this TGI Friday's in Huntington Station may have turned a corner.  It has improved immensely since we visited them over a year ago. However, now for the caveats.  First off, we ordered a ""premium"" entree.  Second, because we were TGIF members, we used a buy one get one free entrée promotional email coupon.  Third, this particular Friday's is located within an area that has experienced a huge growth in available casual dining options during the past eight or nine months.  The Walt Whitman Shopping Centre location now offers significantly more options than they had before.  Therefore, Friday's, as one of the original three casual dining establishments in the area, has had to step up their game else be crushed by the competition. That being said, I believe we hit the jackpot at this particular location.  Because we were card carrying members the TGIF club or whatever it is they call it, they gave us complimentary chips and salsa.  It wasn't an overly generous portion, but I tell you, these were no flimsy, salty, greasy, chips with catchup sweet salsa.  Oh no, my friends.  These were strips of chips that were thick enough to qualify as Tostitos Gold chips (see the photo).  The salsa was noticeably improved as well.  It was clean and fresh tasting and free of the sugar and corn syrup from the old concoction.  You could actually taste the onion in it too. For the entrees, we ordered Jack Daniels meals ... I ordered the Flat Iron Steak, my wife ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Breast.  The shrimp was meaty with a crunchy coating, the chicken was succulent and tasty.  This was clearly, not the chicken typically used in their Parmesan Chicken dish. The Flat Iron Steak was as close to the best I've ever eaten.  It had a great taste and was tender enough to cut with a fork.  The tomato and mozzarella salad had small crisp grape tomatoes and was actually quite tasty.  I had the standard fries as well and, while they were great tasting, they were slightly on the limp side. To sum up, it was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.  But, as I said before, it was a premium entry.  If anyone wants to roll the dice and try one of standard entrees, please do so and post your review as well.  I'm curious to see if you were as satisfied as I.   Take care!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064

I asked for a medium well burger and it arrived crispy and charred. The fries were cold. One of my colleagues didn't get to eat at all. The waitress should've had some help.

17,Brandie E.,"West Babylon, NY",93,62,5.0,1.0,2015-05-05,"We have been going to this particular location for pretty much as long as it has been open and have never encountered such poor management/lack of customer service by the manager (who refused to give me his name and last name multiple times).  All our entrees did not come out together and our waitress didn't tell us why and then forgot to go check on the food when she walked by our table and asked where the 3rd entree was while ours sat getting cold. One of my companions got up to try to find a manager and ended up having to ask a busboy to send him over. The manager arrived and the distaste for our inquiry about the food could not have been MORE apparent if he tried. He seemed like we were a complete inconvenience to be asking to speak to him and he could not have cared less that we were having an issue. We actually said to him that he just seemed to not care in the slightest bit, at which point he rattled off a list of possible solutions to us like he was reading out of a book.  At that point it wasn't even about the food, but about this man's attitude, which seriously needs readjusting. He needs to be send back to customer service class because he has zero regard for the needs of the customer, from his body language to his bored tone like you were lucky you were getting to speak to him. Thanks to his obnoxious attitude, we won't be returning to this location. You know the manager is useless and rude when even the guy opening the door and seating people apologizes for what has happened. Wow.  We also ended up with 3 servers for some reason - one who took over after our original waitress, and then another who dropped the check off to us while practically running past us . . . totally checked out staff who didn't care that we were having a poor experience. Thumbs down in a huge way. That said, so long as you don't have to deal with that guy and his attitude, the bacon mac n cheese bites are yummy. I still find it annoying that this location calls it a pick-three when wings are preselected for you and you only actually get to ""pick"" 2 items. It's not like this at all their locations and I wish they would change this. All the Jack Daniel's items are so yummy even if they are so unhealthy. It's a shame we didn't get to try the sizzling chicken after all that drama, nor did any of us finish our food since we lost our appetites with the attitude. Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000004

My family and I have gone here on Sunday afternoons but usually try to avoid it. Other TGI Friday's locations usually do not have a service problem but this one in particular is both slow to greet and bring us to a table when the restaurant is halfway empty.

Kali our server was very friendly, a transport from California, and most efficient with taking our order.  (Kali from Cali) very sweet, move on to something better.  This restaurant is missing customers, at 6pm there were 8 in the whole restaurant. The music was way to loud and the servers were dancing throughout the place with nothing else to do. I ordered a bottle of a Cabernet but Kali came back to say they were out, so settled on a Malbec that was fair... Bottle retails for 8.00, they sell for 25.00 Wouldn't be here, but I was greedy and received a buy one entree and get one free, so I went for it...

There is also a White Castle up the road. And for just few dollars more --per person-- there is a Cheesecake Factory on the other side of the mall. IF YOU ARE A SMALL RODENT or SEAGULL do not even EAT OUT OF THE DUMPSTER of TGIF at this location! Go around to the Panera Bread dumpster on the other side of the mall.  ************************************************************************** I have not been here in YEARS. (This location OR any other TGIFs)  In the ""crap-chain"" restaurant race;  I have found-- Applebee's is the ""best"" (appetizers are excellent - sometimes) , with Ruby Tuesday as ""second best"" (their salad bar truly sucks however) and this .... TGIF ( That Gross Icky Food) rates DEAD last. (Well- with me. Obviously the ""gerbils of the Long Island dining society"" love this place-- always packed 24/7. WTF? Why? Was Olive Garden closed ? )   *  _______12:00 lunch / noon holiday season of 2015._____________ * With friends & family (it was THEIR choice to come here--not mine)  Ordered a convoluted chicken & shrimp combo. Now it was $16.00-- so I guess it was NOT the ""lunch menu"" but the regular dinner menu? ? ? ? Photo in menu was BIG & looked GREAT !  My co-eaters ordered ""light"" (always discomforting when YOU are STARVING and they aint) LOL.  Anyway....... The Chicken & Shrimp dish arrived to my place at the table....... You know that feeling you get when someone pees on your grave?  Yeah. That's how I felt. (I SO HOPE THE MANAGER IS READING THIS because that's one of my favorite jokes in my collection)  My  plate was huge and the ""food"" only took up about 35% of the plate area. LOTS OF EMPTY SPACE on the plate.  * If I was on a diet this would have been perfect!*  The ""shrimp"" were SMALL -- they were not-even one inch in diameter ones- (you know, the type that cost $6.99 for a giant bag at Target or Wal-Mart. ) They were in a marinara sauce & cheese on the bottom (why not on top ? One wonders). You could fit this portion of the dish in the PALM OF YOUR HAND and still have extra hand room!  The ""chicken"" portion was hard and rubberized. It was obvious that it was a chicken breast section that was frozen- then microwaved (WAY TOO MUCH) to defrost it- then grilled for 2 minutes to FOOL me. It was very very very hard to cut because it was so rubbery (sorry to use the ""rubber"" food texture cliche -- I'm late for work right now) . It was also SMALL- also would fit in the palm of your hand - with extra room in the said hand. It came with a SMALL side of mashed potatoes - tasted OK but for the love of God- why not pad out the too-small dish with LOTS of mashed potatoes?  Make the damn plate look good!  Make it look like I'm getting my money's worth!  I worked in a kitchen in the early 1980s. At the end of the evening - I always had a HUGE tray of mashed potatoes that went right into the garbage--so I know this is an expendable side dish (just like rice & pasta) . Again PAD THE F**KER OUT WITH SOMETHING -- ANYTHING to not make the dish look so f**king skimpy God Dammit !  I was sooooo going to send this back but I hate doing this;  1) out of courtesy to my dining partners. No need to make a happy table uncomfortable & pause for me to get my new food back . And 2) Who knows what they will spit up in my food ( the replacement meal). Not worth it. That's why God made Yelp.  Dinner ,     soda,    tax,    tip     (service was fine)      =     $23.00    (aprox.)  For that amount of money I could have eaten at any given FAST FOOD restaurant THREE times and actually enjoyed my meal !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

I was a little reluctant to come again but the kids wanted to eat at Fridays so we jumped in the car and headed out. we got here and although the restaurant is about 25% full ( and filthy ) we still had to wait a half an hour! finally after sitting down and ordering to no surprise I ordered the Jack Daniels Rib eye steak and shrimp with a side order of mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium rare and of course, it came well done with cold mashed potatoes NO shrimp and no macaroni and cheese. My wife ordered sizzling chicken and cheese with no onions and no peppers how did it come out? She got three orders of sizzling chicken with no sizzle loaded with onions and peppers!!!!! Another half hour goes by and we decide to leave without eating!!!!! I took the kids to the car while my wife paid for the kids meal and talked to the manager (who by the way was dressed like a plumber) this place has the worst service and filthy!!!!! There are not enough gift cards in the world to make me go back to that location!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

Took 20 minutes to heat up the dip and dish out some chips.  Asked for the check when the food came. Another 20 minutes.  At the bar.  Gave this place another shot and it blew it. Hard.

4,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",4790,1076,5766.0,2.0,2016-04-04,"Some highs and lows at my first visit to Friday's in quite some time... Highs: * Our server was sweet and constantly put our orders in so we always had food at the table * Endless. Apps. $12. * Chicken fingers, fried green beans & potstickers Lows: * The rest of the food... tasted like we popped into the supermarket, bought TGI Friday's microwavable meals and served them. Stay away from the spinach dip (an old favorite), the mozz sticks (sad) and the skins (what happened here?). A serious warning for the tostada, don't eat it. It's... slimy.  * Most of the sauces had a film over them. Not great.  * Bathroom was unclean Could you have fun here during happy hour with cheap drinks and unlimited chicken fingers? Sure! But really, I don't trust any place that can't make simple menu items, especially ones that are signature items that they've been making forever. Friday rocks, TGI Friday's... not so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
3,Brad B.,"San Diego, CA",4916,964,1518.0,3.0,2016-04-06,"""Hey, I have an idea. Let's go somewhere really Long Island."" - Ruggy's famous last words.  After this statement we ended up at TGI Friday's with a commitment to eat only the endless appetizers that they've been promoting on TV. We would not stray and we'd eat till we felt sick... literally.  The good: Ummmm... let's create another category as ""good"" simply does not apply. The alright: The boneless wings, undressed with sauce on the side. Surprisingly the PB&J was a nit with our group, with the ghost pepper coming in a close second for me. Not nearly hot enough but I suppose these mega-chains have to temper things like this for the average Joe. The bad: The potato skins. Remember these things? They were (and maybe still are) a signature item for the TGIF franchise. My buddy drew said it best: ""tasted like we popped into the supermarket, bought TGI Friday's microwavable meals and served them."" Dead on.  The ugly: The tostada should not be served to anyone or anything. Soggy and small with a flavor combo that was baffling. Simply put, disgusting. If you decide to jump into the endless app pool stay away from these suckers. Just a bad, bad, bad idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

24,Maria G.,"Deer Park, NY",0,1,,1.0,2016-08-20,"This is by far the WORST Friday's I have ever been to. I am not a chain restaurant person, however Friday's is one I do visit on occasion, especially for endless apps because I love the green beans.  When we got there, there were probably about 3 waits before us. 2 groups of 3 or 4 people and 1 larger group. Half the place was empty but we were all still waiting.  Once seated... It took at least 15 minutes for our drinks, which seems way too long considering half the place was empty, and there were only a few people at the bar.  The buffalo wings looked and tasted like they were sitting under a heat lamp. The potato skins were hard. The flat bread was burnt and had NO chicken on it. When I say not one piece, not one piece of chicken. First order of green bean fries were just ok. Half of them came on plate not fried. Like the breeding had come off. The second plate of green beans I will say was much better.  The waitress herself was pleasant! The bus boy bringing out our food was a bit rude. We said thank you every time and got no response back.  Overall I will NEVER go back to this Friday's again. More than half empty on a Friday night tells you something!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

After we finished eating, she just asked ""what are we having for dessert?"" We didn't even say we wanted dessert and second of all, she looked so miserable all night long. Once we were ready to pay, she brought us our bill, and when we left our debit card for her to take., she didn't ask if we're ready to pay she just snatched it from the table!!! Never again!!!

The server said he'd get us another order, we respectfully declined and went to a different restaurant.  Lesson learned, don't ever trust a restaurant is clean based off of its chain name.  We are so disgusted!

Both the service and food were horrible.  We were standing there waiting to be seated not being acknowledged when it wasn't even busy.  Finally, we get acknowledged and she runs off to check the upstairs booths.  Then another angry woman comes over irritated to seat us.  We were not even greeted by her or spoken to!  Our waitress couldn't have been more unpleasant or less knowledgeable if she tried.  She was blatantly irritated to answer simple questions such as ""what kind of wing sauces are available?"" The sauce on the wings was not what we asked for.  The pot stickers were stiff and the BBQ flatbread was clearly burnt. This experience may turn us off from one of our favorite go to restaurants.  Save yourself the trip and money and do NOT go here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
1,Mary A.,"Amityville, NY",77,18,1.0,1.0,2016-12-27,"I wish I had read all of these horrible Yelp reviews before we tried to dine at this TGI Friday's yesterday. It was the day after Christmas and we had to make a return at Walt Whitman Mall. We were originally going to eat at a nicer restaurant, but had a craving for wings and opted for TGI Fridays instead. We usually love the endless apps and Jack Daniel's grill items. The restaurant seemed busy enough, but not slam packed like the mall. We waited a minute or two for other groups to be seated ahead of us, were led over to a table next to the kitchen that still had a spray bottle sitting on it from the quick wipe down. We asked for a different table and went upstairs. The decor is great and an interesting set up. This is where the compliments end, however. Our waitress Renee was very sweet and came over to introduce herself and take our drink orders. We received our teas promptly and placed an order for endless buffalo wings. We then put in an order for our entrees and waited. And waited. And waited. We looked at our watches to realize nearly an hour had passed since we walked into the restaurant. I could overhear the table behind us returning food to the kitchen for a third time due to an incorrect order. A few moments later, someone else asked the waitress for the manager. She walked over to ask us if we ever received our buffalo wings. We told her to go ahead and cancel our order since we'd probably receive it at the same time as our entrees and really wouldn't be able to take advantage of the ""endless"" portion of the deal. Maybe we ordered an endless wait instead? We couldn't find our server after that to let her know we weren't going to wait for our entrees any longer and left cash on the table to cover our drinks and a tip for her effort. I couldn't believe that no one thought to give us an update on our food being delayed or make anything but a half-hearted effort to excuse it. I usually love TGI Fridays, but now I'm not so sure I'll be returning- especially not to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
