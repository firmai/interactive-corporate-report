53,Billy B.,"Chester, PA",0,3,,1.0,2012-08-15,"I've been here twice and ordered steak both times. On my first visit, the steak was overcooked but I didn't complain and still ate it. I visited again last night, ordered another medium rare steak and it came out medium well. This time, however, I let the waitress know and had it recooked. Ten-fifteen minutes later, the manager delivers my steak, I cut into it while she's there and again it is almost well done! I'm sure she knew that it wasn't cooked to my liking but being in the business myself, I just sucked it up, took my losses, took a couple bites of the dry steak and threw out my entire dinner. Obviously, I'll never dine here again. How many strikes does one need? Three is enough!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=60,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005
54,Kevin C.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2012-11-12,"I was there with my friends last Saturday. OK.. It was late night but we could have been served way better. Our server seemed so lost and screwed up every order we gave him. But really? Do I have to wait 15 minutes to get beer?????? He took orders for something that they ran out (Sam Adams) and it took 20 minutes for him to come back to our table saying they ran out. (Are you kidding me????)  So instead, we ordered Heineken and someone (bartender??) ended up bringing us Coors Light. Of course, it took 15 minutes for the wrong beer. He ended up overcharging us for the Sam Adams that they ran out.

75,Aliyah M.,"Bogota, NJ",111,102,25.0,4.0,2012-11-19,"I come here for one reason- half-priced appetizers after 10 pm. I would ABSOLUTELY NOT pay full price for.. well.. anything on the menu. We go, order a few milkshakes, a bunch of boneless wings, a plate of nachos (which is HUGE, btw), a chicken quesadilla, and what the server suggests if we feel like it- and we chow down. Its not gourmet but hey- this is Applebee's, guys. You all know what you're getting yourselves into.  Our servers have always been pleasant, if not as prompt as we like it but since its always really packed after 10 pm and these people have to run around listening to annoying customers all day with a smile on their face, I don't mind.  I like the food and it's always enough. If it's not enough, spend another 5 bucks and get another full order or wings! Yay! Nothing has ever tasted bad or stale, and I would absolutely come back.

The servers are money hungry as they always find a way to ""accidentally"" upcharge your bill despite the meal being part of the late night half off deal. I mean, who else would come here if it wasn't for that reason?! Part of me wishes that there are better options nearby where the craft drinks are cheap, and crowd noise low enough for you to catch with your group of friends, and screens big enough where you are about to enjoy the game. Sadly, this is the only option around. Except for Hooters (they primarily serve domestic beers).  Aside from that tangent, what I can assert as true is the staff is dimwitted and money hungry, and managers unapologetic and rude. I complained numerous times for their delay of food coming out.  Yet, given the monopoly they seem to have, I don't expect to avoid this place until some where else worthwhile opens up. All in all, just know what to expect and expect to tip less, cause they'll find a way to up charge you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=40,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

I've been here many times, and it's always prepared quickly and correctly. In fact, I'm usually thinking, ""wow, this is pretty good for an Applebee's"".  The servers have always been friendly and attentive when I've been here. It's a very comfy vibe here too for some reason, which is strange because you would think all Applebee's would be the same, but I've found that some tend to be more high-strung than others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=40,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064
78,Ben F.,"New Milford, NJ",162,122,103.0,3.0,2013-01-18,"This is definitely one of the friendlier and down to earth Applebee's. The servers will stop and chat with a table. Plus, they actually have opinions on the food, they will tell you what they recommend and don't recommend. I like when they do this based on experience and not the price point. Which our server did. He was very knowledgeable and helped my friend--who had never been there before--navigate the menu.  The apps are delicious and the prices aren't crazy. There's usually something for everyone.  It can get a little crowded/noisy but you get what you pay for. Enjoy the environment. Bring some friends.

44,Manda D.,"Hasbrouck Heights, NJ",21,25,18.0,1.0,2013-04-24,"Beware CAMILLE-I don't know how she spells her name but she is clearly miserable as a waitress and taking it out on the restaurants guests. She didn't take our menus away, didn't bring out our food or our drinks (they were brought out by other people) and when we requested lemons she's kept us waiting fifteen minutes. She took our order, brought a single glass of water to the table and then disappeared to get the lemons. In the meantime our food and my drink from the bar was brought over by another server. When she came out of the kitchen 15 minutes later with no lemons, we watched as she approached two other tables- bigger tables with more people and thus capable of giving her a bigger tip- and ignored us. Upon seeing our faces, before we even said anything she came over and said angrily, ""you have to give me a minute okay, I just got a four top and six top and I have to help them. I'll get your lemons in a minute."" Then she rolled her eyes and shook her head, it was behind my friends back but I was facing her and could see her clearly. When she walked by I told her we needed plates, napkins, straws and the rest of our order which hadn't made it out of the kitchen and she started looking at me like I had three heads, I added in that I realized she was busy but I saw her roll her eyes and she's not invisible- she just walked away! Unbelievably rude- the manager then came over with our lemons and in front of the manager and VERY loud she goes, ""Oh and I'm not serving this table anymore!"" I would have fired her on the spot- all the other guests were just staring at her and I just felt so much pity for her. How pathetic it is to be a grown adult and not be able to control yourself in front of other people. Not to mention it's her job- the manager was polite and he apologized but I really felt like no patron should have to sit through that- oh and to top it off the waitress put in the wrong order for us she gave us chicken nachos which I believe is more expensive and not what we asked for- we wanted regular nachos.  This was a frequent hang out place for a few of my friends, but every time we go now it just gets worse and worse. We go for the late night apps/drinks and almost always the server's are rude. Mostly this is because I usually go with only one or two other people and a ten dollar check isn't going to yield a big tip. So the servers are money hungry but I've had experiences where I've had to call a manager over. The one manager, James is nice, very apologetic and accommodating, but he's fighting a losing battle with unprofessional and downright rude staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=60,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

Usually good for a burger, sandwich, appys, etc. No complaints with other locations. But.. ate at this Hackensack location last night.. HORRIBLE! Waited quite some time for a burger and a steak. When the food finally did appear, both were not cooked as specified. My BF requested his steak medium and it was more on the medium rare side. I ordered my burger medium as well and it was barely even cooked, still raw and cold in the middle. Waited forever for our server to come back as he conveniently disappeared. When he finally did I requested a new burger, waited another 10 minutes and the 2nd burger was STILL way beyond medium... very rare. Ate it since by this point I was starving and didn't feel like waiting another 10-15 min and my BF was pretty much done with his meal at this point. Some rude person came over at some point and asked how our visit was so I explained the problems and the jerk ends up giving ME an attitude. Didn't make ANY attempt to rectify it and make us happy.

I try and try again to at least like this place, but it just always disappoints. Okay, before I go on with this, I am not hard to please (I easily give 4-5 stars). Just give me a drink and put in the food order and we will be best friends. I work in the same industry and I totally understand we get busy with other tables, but to go around a table and making it obvious you don't wanna take us is just rude, especially if we have to wait 10-15 minutes just to get greeted. Just say ""Give me one second and I will be with you"" is enough for me to know you acknowledged my presence. Every time I attempt and give a chance to this place, my boyfriend puts a timer on and it seriously takes us 10-15 minutes to get greeted. That is not the worst thing yet. So I come in with friends and have more on their way. We get sat quick, but takes forever for a server to greet us. So the rest of our friends come in 30 minutes before closing. The host greeted them by saying, ""you know we are closing in 30 minutes right."" And my friends were puzzled and said we""ll make it quick. I honestly felt bad that the rest came so late and the kitchen was about to close and the restaurant was about to close and we were still there. I ACTUALLY FELT BAD AT FIRST. But after the host came to our table and said ""well if you plan on ordering food, you have to go to the bar and order..and you gotta make it quick."" I was shocked. If I were to say that to a guest, I would've gotten fired on the spot. I felt disrespected. So fine we go to the bar to join our friends that ordered food. I was just so heated that I asked for a manager. Well, that was a mistake. I talked to him and it was not going anywhere. He even said ""but I don't understand how hard it is for you to get up from your table to the bar and just order."" I was even more shocked. Like I just lost respect for this place. I told him if he wanted to say sorry at least act like you mean it and he's just like, ""but I don't know what else you want me to say..I am saying sorry!""  I decided to leave, and my friends that stayed to wait for their food said that they heard that manager talking crap about the situation amongst the employees.

I have been to the one in Garfield once, and I got good service too (could have been because our server was the boyfriend of a friend, but regardless, everyone in that Applebee's were so much better).

The fact that this has happened on three separate occasions is not a service issue- it's a management issue. I hope that they will read this review and address this very bizarre issue that I promise is a very cheap and easy fix. My next frustrations came with takeout. Both times I have ordered takeout from this particular Applebee's they have failed to start preparing my food prior to my arrival. The first time I called in and placed my order over the phone. When my boyfriend arrived at the expected pickup time they admitted that they hadn't started the order. The reason I never previously reviewed them was due to the fact that the manager comped one of our apps and I felt like it was a reasonable accommodation. Tonight I placed an order for pickup through online ordering and when I arrived on site while the employee was very nice and polite it was obvious that again my order hadn't been started even though this was my pickup time. My food was promptly started but I now know that I just really can't rely on my food being ready on time at this location. Overall this location is run down and outdated in comparison to other Applebee's locations. This probably won't be my last time visiting this Applebee's but it is only out of convenience and the fact that I like the food. The reality is that I will continue to choose other local dinning options while visiting this specific franchise less frequently than I otherwise would if it was more on par with the standard that has been set by other Applebee's locations I have visited. If I could give a 2.5 I would but this place just doesn't deserve a 3 star review. Hopefully they can work on some of the things I mentioned in my review and eventually when I give them another chance in the future and at that time I'll adjust my rating but for now they've got some things to tweak.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,2.248,2.08
40,Barry F.,"Secaucus, NJ",2,5,,1.0,2015-06-14,"Went to this Applebees a few days ago with a friend.  We sat at the bar in the early afternoon for some beers and lunch.  The bar was not crowded at all maybe four other people there.  The service was absolutely horrible.  The bartender came to take our drink order after we already been sitting for several minutes and had the attitude that we were bothering him on this lazy afternoon.  He gave us our menus and forgot about us.  He never came back to ask if we wanted to order and finally we needed to flag him down and ask if we could order appetizers.  We gave him our order and the appetizers came out promptly however the bartender had assumed that my friend wanted a small plate combo instead of the two full size orders.  This is not a giant deal but he should have asked what option my friend wanted.  The food was fine no issues there but after receiving our appetizers we were once again forgotten.  The bartender must have assumed we were done however I was interested in ordering an entree.  We waited for over twenty minutes to see if Mr. Personality would ask if we were ok.  He never asked if we would like another round of drinks or if we wanted to order any other food.  He then brought the check over without us having asked for it.  Now I realize that at Applebees they put the check in a glass in front of you and update it when you order but this guy plopped it right in front of us.  Well at this point I as fed up with the horrible attitude from this guy so I paid the check and his tip was zero.  I have never in my adult life tipped someone nothing.  I frequent other Applebees on occasion and have never had such a bad experience.  Save yourself the aggravation if you walk in and Ben is behind the bar just leave.  I don't know abut the rest of the staff, they may be awesome, but I will never be back to find out.  Applebees management you probably lost out on double or triple of amount of what my bill was including beers and instead I went to popeyes so sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=60,2.08,2.08,2.08,2.116,2.08

6,Joe Y.,"Palisades Park, NJ",123,4,,1.0,2015-08-17,"Let me start with this- this is an applebees; expectations are NOT high. I expect prices to be cheap and food to be hastily made, even microwaved is acceptable. That's fair to expect from an Applebees, right? This review is based on 5 occasions of going back (you want to give them a chance right?) and I've had the same experience EVERY TIME. With that said, the things you expect to be actually acceptable are all bad. If you ask for waters to start off, expect not to get it until you ask them at least two more times as they pass by. Maybe they're going to the mountains to get the water, but aside from that, this basic task is always a complete fail. The food will be bad. Don't expect anything fantastic. But the 1 star is not for the food. It's for the service. Lol no one will go to applebees looking for good food. It's because you want some late night half price appetizers for cheap.  If you want the check, just assume that they are processing fresh wood into paper and hand printing your bill onto it, because it takes way too long. Don't expect the check the first time you ask for it. Ask for it maybe 2 or 3 times. Otherwise expect to sit there until they close.  This is basic stuff, Hackensack Applebees. The management need to better train their employees. We understand they're mostly high school kids- but this is just basic stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,2.052,2.08

I completely understand that this is, after all, an Applebee's and my expectations aren't high at all. That being said, this establishment is very poorly run as the servers don't even have enough decency to treat customers with a little respect. My waiter threw 3 straws at me when I asked for one. Then, after bringing my food, he joked that he forgot to add special seasoning and took it around the corner and came back (implying that he was going to spit in it). I understand he was joking but there's a thin line between being funny and doing your job. Especially when I waited about 40 minutes for my plate and completely lost my appetite.

They're clean, there's a lot to choose from on the menu, the prices are good, and there are tablets by every table to play games on and to check your meal out. The servers are knowledgeable about the food, and they have an open bar with many tvs for the game. They even hire the mentally handicapped for bus boy positions, that way they can gain some work experience. I think that's very nice of them. CONS: Applebees is very slow at bringing out your food. Also, when they're busy, they don't turn over tables fast enough which causes the waiting time for people coming in to increase. Another thing that I don't like is that they don't check up on you regularly. My glass was starting to collect dust before my server asked if I wanted another one. OVERALL: This is a great Applebees to go to. Many of their pros are the same as with any Applebees, and if your willing to overlook a few of their cons, I think you'll enjoy it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

27,Erin O.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",1,4,,4.0,2017-08-16,First time at this Applebee's location and the service was fantastic. Dave made sure our drinks were always refilled and our food came out fast and hot!

22,Nico L.,"Paramus, NJ",87,1,1.0,4.0,2017-09-27,"I wouldn't say I frequent this location but I have been here a good amount of times. Usually for the half apps or for cheap find drinks. My last visit wasn't the best though. Our waiter was knowledgeable and funny nothing wrong with the staff upon this visit, however my grilled shrimp came out twice uncooked as if it went straight from the freezer to the grill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
25,Katelynn T.,"NJ, NJ",112,2,,1.0,2017-10-06,I wish I could give this no stars. The service was beyond awful. Went with a group of friends for half apps and I waited over an hour for my meal to come for it to be the wrong thing. Waitress never really checked in on us. I wish I could get the time I wasted here back. 3 hours for a couple appetizers and drinks is ridiculous. Will never be back here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
26,craig S.,"Lodi, NJ",0,27,,4.0,2017-11-08,"I like the food at Applebee's. Their food is good and the price is reasonable. Especially, 2 for 20 is kicking ass. I always get 2 for 20 every time I go to Applebee's. This deal does not have a lot of options for the main meal, but they all taste good. The only thing I was not happy is that when I did take-out last time. I ordered 2 for 20 and when I paid, I paid cash. I gave the person who took the order exact money. The person's name who took my order was Faith. When I paid, Faith said tips are not included, and then I said ""well, I am doing take-out"". As soon as I said that, she gave me a dirty look. I have never seen any servers asking tips for take-out. If I am going to leave tips for what I am spending, I rather eat in at the restaurant and get a full service than doing take out. I have done take out 2 more times ever since then, but Faith was not there. The other people who took my order never asked for tips and they were really nice and friendly",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
21,Margo A.,"Matawan, NJ",190,3,,1.0,2018-01-04,"I came to this Applebee's with my boyfriend on a snowy day. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant. The host was laying down on the waiting area on his phone. He finally realized we were there after a few minutes and then sat us. After, our waitress came by and I asked her if we could wait till 10pm to order the half off apps (it was 9:50pm). She then said that they can't ""give up a table"" and she rolled her eyes. She sent the manager over and he was very unclear and said ""we don't normally wait, can't do nothing about it now"". Me and my boyfriend decided to get up and leave because not only was it extremely unprofessional, but we felt awkward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-hackensack,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
