Tried bringing drinks with me and was told this was a health hazard and trust me trying to drink enough pepsi or lemonade to last an hour in 5 seconds hurts so take free drinks as you will.<br>At my applebee's the only person who works harder than the host is the bartender but their advantage is that they make more and sometimes they get to be servers.<br>As a host ( at this applebees) you answer phones, clean bathrooms, run food,run drinks from the bar, take drink orders, bus tables, seat guests, and do any favors guests need. All while being micro managed by servers, other hosts, and managers.<br>MANAGERS DONT KNOW MY NAME, despite constantly reminding my manager of my name I keep getting in trouble for things another female hostess does. This means that routinely I am dragged into the managers office and scolded to near tears by managers on duty when I have done nothing wrong and told that my denial of these action is ""giving them attitude"".<br>And what can you expect for all this? NOT MINIMUM WAGE they have said several times that tips will make up minimum wage, and this is rarely true at my place of work, on a busy night when we reach waitlist I make 50$ for 7-8 hours of work this barely makes minimum wage on a friday night. Base pay for this region was $4.00 an hour and 2% tips ITS NOT ENOUGH. Do yourself a favor and go work at CVS, WALMART, hell DOLLAR GENERAL at least you can make decent wages and as for myself I'll be looking for a way out if possible.","learn workers names and personalities, find out who is in whos pocket, start paying $5.50 an hour for hostesses would help a ton, teach managers what problems deserve what actions (dont disrupt the entire workday calling everyone into the office if you think someone was talking to long at a register etc.) I do have to say for every terrible manager or co- worker I have an exceptional one, find the good ones and reward them find the micro-managing over dramatic people please and fix it.

Don't expect to have a home life. You are at the mercy of your general manager you could end up doing the majority of the work. They asked the district manager who had been in his position for 11 years and with the company for nearly 30 years to either step down or be fired. Very sad. Very disrespectful treatment of a great man and mentor.,"I would say try to emulate the top companies to work for. Find out what's going on a microscale in your restaurant instead of having your district manager speak super technically and above the problem. Start getting down in the trenches and find out what's really going on. Don't keep general managers around that refused to hire extra staff when they have plenty of applications. Not having enough staff means the guest experience goes to the pits and your reputation is ruined. Try to run things in a way that makes your employees and managers think you respect their work, instead of running it like its only for profit. There is a lot of talk about taking care of people and how your numbers will follow but it is not what I have seen in person. This is why I believe the Austin area is so low on managers people are jumping off this ship at a high rate. I think you should not immediately take the guests words when they complain to corporate. I have seen many times when people lie to try to get extra money or extra things for free. It seems like if the customer has a bad reputation in a town for behaving badly you wouldn't give them precedence. If several people are telling you the same thing you may consider it.

However, they are unwilling to pay an employee to do the training so the processes ends being a new employee on their own station while current employees from the other stations bark out instructions to them. If you fall behind and your ticket times go over the magical number they set, management will harass you from the other side of the line. They do not offer vacation, insurance, personal days, or benefits of any kind. You will have to work holidays, including Thanksgiving and Christmas eve. They do not allow gratuity or compensation for table complaints or unpaid checks. Employees are expected to show up regardless of weather conditions and are expected to stay open without considering the safety of their employees. Health codes prevent sick people from handling food but if you have a cold and call out they expect you to bring a note from a doctor. Did I mention they do not offer health insurance? Upper management set goals that are mathematically unreachable and expect store employees to explain why the store is down in sales.

Overall casual dress code and discounted meals.","Just another restaurant trained to micromanage the life out of their staff. Mostly management sits at expo and screams at their understaffed front of the house to run food. They actually have enough staff to have food runners and one server for every four tables but they make cuts to save money even if their service takes a huge hit and then they wonder why they have difficult lunches and dinners. There is a very small chance that you will be treated with respect unless you are close on a personal level with managers. They have VERY high expectations and instead of thinking ""What can I do as a manager to make it easier on my staff?"" many, many new servers will be taken to the back to get reprimanded and talked down to, and then expected to serve the rest of the night with a smile on their face.<br><br>The atmosphere is so casual and shows such obvious favoritism to senior servers that the conversations border on inappropriate often, and many servers were spoken of in a harassing manner by both management and servers when their backs were turned.<br><br>Theft was very common, and server books and money from the register would turn up missing constantly and there never seemed to be anything that upper management did to make the staff feel safe. The attitude was to hide your personal belongings and be careful rather than to assume the company would assist you in any way with this issue.<br><br>After 10pm during the week, management cuts the back of the house down to two people and the servers are expected to space out their orders by five + minutes before ringing them in. Even with four tables in the restaurant the ticket times were always at 20 minutes because management wanted to save $$ and cut the BOH, resulting in poor service and unsatisfied customers.<br><br>Customers are not there to appreciate your service. It's basically one notch above fast food for them, even if you are doing the same job that a server at a nicer casual restaurant would do. The tips are usually terrible, and you will have some of the most difficult tables in the industry coupled with hoards of teenagers and families with babies that leave a mess that spans half the dining room.<br><br> In my time at Applebee's, I didn't see one day go by without at least one server getting talked down to so heavily that they were visually upset. Many people did not quit by putting in a two weeks notice but by walking out in the middle of their shift, if that tells you anything.",Demanding perfection doesn't lead to better service. Assisting your servers and helping them without degrading them will encourage them to respect their place of business instead of trying to cut corners. Even the best employee will start to slip when they are only put under pressure and criticized for their performance.

If you weren't one of them, you could not expect any sort of remotely polite interaction or fair treatment. Servers spend way too much time talking, joking around, and playing pranks on new employees. They then blame the cooks and hosts/hostesses when they don't receive tips. They asked me to seat certain people in their section, based on the attractiveness, race, age, or gender of those people. Some attempted to bribe me by giving me large shares of their tips if I would agree not to seat diners of certain races or ages in ther sections (I did not accept this). I have seen employees stand right in front of guests and complain about having to serve them, not even caring that the people are sitting right there and listening. Talking to management is useless as the majority of them are very close friends with the staff and gladly join in their antics.","Advise restaurant managers to separate their personal friendships and romantic relationship interests from work.

Uniforms are dull, but they are working on that as well.

A manager can get a lot done in 45 hours. When you ask for advice from a manager, really want that advice. Many a Area director or Gm really don't value employee feedback.
