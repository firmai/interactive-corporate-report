Regina H.,"Essington, PA",0,4,,2.0,1/24/2017,Me and my girlfriend came in to eat around 5pm... no server came to our table to greet us or anything we literally sat there until my friend said something to 1 of the servers.. she then finally came over with a bit of an attitude told us this wasn't her section and she pointed to were her section was... she then asked for our order.. was very pleasant after that..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=20
Vivienne L.,"Philadelphia, PA",258,210,207,3.0,12/17/2015,"We came her for the lunch duo specials. I got the Caesar salad with farmers market soup. The Caesar was really good, the chicken had a lot of flavor. The soup was alright, it wasn't really my taste. It has a squash base with vegetables. We also got the hummus appetizer. The pita bread had the consistency of a soft leather handbag and the hummus has tomato blended into it. The pita bread was alright but I didn't like the sweetness of the hummus. My dad also got the duo with mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza and the farmers market soup. The pizza needed more sauce and didn't have much flavor. He liked the soup, however but it was not spectacular. The portion size was reasonable. I would take this lunch duo over Panera bread's. The atmosphere is classy but also casual. I would probably come here for their pastas for dinner but not so much for lunch. The service was alright, the waiter wasn't as attentive as we would have liked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=20

Nunu M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,2,,1.0,3/25/2017,Horrible experience! Came at 915 pm sat night and it was completely empty. The two ladies in the front said it would be a 20 minute wait.

Matt R.,"Philadelphia, PA",60,330,266,3.0,6/23/2013,"The co-workers and I usually joke that we don't go to this place for lunch because we don't have 90 minutes to waste, but that's on par with most of the chains on City ave.   Other than a little slow for the food at lunch it's the typical CPK food menu, expensive  fancy pizza.  I will give them kudos though for stepping up their craft beer game recently.  Service is always polite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=20
Mia B.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,13,7,2.0,3/5/2016,"I have to say, each time I visit CPK I'm more underwhelmed than the last. For some reason I really want to like this place; It gives me great memories of my college years of nearly 10 years ago. Let's face it though, the food is average, some dishes are overpriced and the ambiance is subpar. I went last night with a friend. I will note our server was awesome. Anyway, I got the jerk chicken thin crust pizza and my friend got the jambalaya pasta. The pizza was oddly sweet, like I could taste the sugar. Now maybe it was because I didn't get bacon. Perhaps the salt would've cut the sweetness. I'm not sure that's how it works but I am sure I'll never order it again. My friend picked at her pasta noting it was dry and not so flavorful. I should just really give up on this place. I wish we wouldve went somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=20

Matthew A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,2.0,2/4/2017,Extremely slow service. This location (City Ave) seems to be struggling with staff training. We waited over 15 minutes to have a waiter come over. The location was well staffed and only was 75% full. Noticed several tables also frustrated with lack of attentive service. People even brought their checks to the bar to pay more quickly.

Colette W.,"Venice, CA",41,119,22,4.0,8/12/2014,"California Pizza Kitchen : Philly Edition I was a little apprehensive about coming here because my friend said the location was a disaster but all I wanted in life was a BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad.  The host was kind she led us to a table that wasn't ready so we went back to the lobby for a couple of minutes.  Salad was the usual FANTASTIC and the server Rere was great. Mojito was good and topped off so I was a happy camper.  CPK has never failed me. EVA !!!!!

Foodimus M.,"Philadelphia, PA",14,141,816,3.0,9/26/2013,"Three words of advice regarding this place: ORDER A PIZZA. I have been here several times and, until recently, didn't take my own advice. There's lots of variety on the menu, and most things are pretty decent, considering it's a chain, and at least they are consistent. The dumplings are good, as is the chinese chicken salad. Besides a range of cocktails and beers, their drinks menu also has ""italian sodas"" with seltzer and sugar-free syrups which are really spectacular, and inspired me to start ordering my own Torani flavored syrups in bulk to make them at home.  Service in the restaurant is hit or miss - some servers have been friendly, prompt, and accommodated special requests, while others have been slow and unresponsive. It doesn't seem to matter whether the restaurant is busy or empty either. Takeout service late at night is also a bit slack, but they are open until 10 which is convenient for me.  You know when you're going here you're eating at a chain, and in the ranks of chains, I think this is pretty decent food. I think that even more now that I finally discovered the pizzas (DUH, what was I waiting for?). The pear and gorgonzola pizza was DELICIOUS, and it's the flat dough that I really go in for.  If you're around from shopping at Target and need a quick bite, or driving in or out from the city, I think this is as good a place to stop and eat as any - the rest of the spots in this mini-mall complex are also chains but far poorer choices in my opinion (gross chain burritos, anyone?). Also, as a chain, they're required to post their calorie counts on the menu, which is a plus for me because even if I don't adjust my food choices accordingly, I can at least be aware of what I'm doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=20
Michelle P.,"Philadelphia, PA",432,1148,4433,3.0,10/29/2013,"I recently got to pick the spot for a lunch with coworkers. For whatever reason, I picked California Pizza Kitchen. Maybe convenience? I struggle each time with the menu because the pesky, but helpful nutrition facts. Unless you plan on having just a soda or a side dish of grilled chicken/shrimp, don't expect to walk away with a meal for under 20 grams of fat. Even the salads are high calorie/high fat.  I opted for the Fire-Roasted Chile Relleno off the ""Lite Adventures"" menu which is fairly low-cal but is packed with 27 grams of fat. I've had it before and knew it was tasty and the dish did not disappointed. I wish I snapped a picture because the presentation was killer. It was the perfect looking fall dish: a plump green chile stuffed with eggplant, cheese, chicken, beans, corn and other veggies sitting in a plate of avocado salsa verde and cilantro. I guess the avocado makes it a good fat :) It was a creamy but not heavy sauce. The dish was the perfect sized lunch too. I left feeling full but not stuffed.  This is a popular work lunch spot, so our server kept everything moving. We had a half table/half booth on the end, which she did awkwardly reach over several times. I guess there wasn't really room to go around the other way? She was pleasant and checked on us several time so I really have no complaints there. My group thought it was odd that they were cleaning the front windows with Windex during the peak of the lunch rush. We could smell it from our table!  So overall I had a good experience despite limited items for the health conscience and the whiffs of Windex.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=20

The food is always cooked to perfection and served in a well presented fashion. Everything is very clean and they have an open kitchen so there isn't any wondering what it looks like behind the door.

Megan J.,"Philadelphia, PA",39,103,75,4.0,11/15/2017,One of the best franchises in the area. Decent size menu with tons of choices other than pizza. I had never been to one of these so I was prepared to only get to choose between different kinds of pizzas. I came here on veterans day for a free meal. I had the tomato basil bisque to start and was delicious. Since it was my first time here they brought us over a complimentary flatbread which was very nice of them! I then had the 5 cheese pizza which was also delicious and fresh tasting. My boyfriend had a crispy chicken sandwich which also tasted fresh. Overall I was impressed with this place and I will no doubt be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia
Sean T.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,23,,2.0,8/27/2017,"The service was 3 stars, friendly but lacking.  Could have been more assertive as I had to wait to order, never got the lemon I asked for, menus never taken off the table, etc.  The food was mixed.  I liked the buffalo cauliflower and the little salad that went on top.  The Kung pao spaghetti (with chicken) was a mistake.  Nothing about it was fresh, just spaghetti in an oily, Szechuan style sauce with a tremendous amount of salt to make up for the lack of flavor.  And I love salt. For $15, I could have went to Han Dynasty and ordered TWO Dan-Dan noodles with a couple dollars to spare and that would have been much more delicious and twice the amount of food.  I wasn't expecting authentic, was just expecting quality for $15.  Big let down and it was a very small amount of chicken I received for the upgrade.   I've had the butter cake years before and that was always delicious.  This time I just wanted to go, so I left without dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia

We looked across the road and saw California Pizza Kitchen. We had never eaten there before and thought we'd give it a try. We were greeted by a friendly host who was able to seat us immediately. It didn't take long before our server greeted us. The service was great.  We ordered the roasted garlic chicken. We thought it'd be delicious, but when we took our first bite it tasted like nothing ... at all. We ordered a side of marinara to dip it in so that there was some kind of flavor.  Our trip could have gone differently if we ordered something else. Over all, I'd recommend others give it a try, but stay away from the roasted garlic pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia

Pasta here is super dry, they are stingy with their portions, and skimp even more on the meat.

Farha A.,"Philadelphia, PA",222,128,173,2.0,7/21/2017,"So the food here is good and probably worth 3 stars at any CPK but this particular review is for the service (or lack there of) we received that day. I just moved in to an apartment complex nearby and we were all ready to feast after a long day of moving. We got there and got seated outside. I kid you not, it took 5-10 minutes just to get water and menus and that was only because I eventually got frustrated and went inside to ask for it. This trend more or less continued throughout the meal. Luckily a couple of our courses came quickly so we weren't super hangry but water refills, getting the bill, etc was a nightmare and extremely slow and I had to keep getting up and going to ask for things. They were super apologetic and nice about it each time but kept doing it and kind of seemed like they were unsure who was serving us, especially in the beginning... We all finished eating and while my parents waited for the check, I had time to walk over to Target, peruse for a few items on a list in different parts of the store, pay, and come back and they were STILL THERE and had just gotten it when I arrived.  I will probably end up going back here because it is one of the few walking distance places near me but I really hope this is not consistent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia

Luxxi R.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,27,44,1.0,4/17/2017,"My God this place sux butt. The service is AWFUL, neither welcoming nor attentive. They basically see you as dollar signs and want you to get in and out. They do not wear gloves or hair coverings. I watched a server pat his hair (which was in a bun) then touch the orange garnishes on my Blue Moon. I ordered a thin n crispy pizza but did not get it. The food came out rather fast, but was extremely bland. My silverware was not polished and I had to ask 2 totally different servers for fresh silverware. The only reason I said something to the manager was bc he approached us. Had he been monitoring his dining room instead of sitting at the bar, he would have been able to possibly recover service. He seemed like he had no idea on how to handle issues, but offered a gift card. When I declined, he said are you sure? It can be used at any location.

It's just that the few times I've gone the service has been less than stellar. This last time, my server was pretty good, but I could tell she got a little agitated when I miscommunicated a menu item. The saying goes: the customer is always right. I don't want the the third degree for something I didn't really want. She was still nice; it just was more stressful than it should have been, complete with the manager coming to the table. Totally unnecessary.  The first time I was here, the waiter was great, the service was just unbearably slow and it was during lunch with hardly anyone there.

The stir fried spaghetti was by no means authentic but the level of spiciness and savoriness maid it very enjoyable. Last but not least we had the salted caramel pudding. I'd give it two thumbs up!

Abhishek Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",117,165,6,4.0,7/10/2013,"I've only been to this location once, but it was a great all around experience, and I'd definitely recommend it! CPK is a national chain of restaurants for specialty pizza and other related food items (pastas, salads, etc.). They tend to be on the pricier end, but some of their pizzas are pretty darn good, and certainly justify their price tag. At this location, I've found the veggie on the honey wheat crust and the tostada pizza to both be great. Both are veggie friendly pizzas (provided your local establishment doesn't use anchovies in the ranch for the tostada), and they're both off the hook amazing. The tostada is especially awesome. A layer of beans, crunchy lettuce and tomatoes, ranch, and crispy tortilla strips bring it all together in a wonderful combination. Tip: they're glad to actually make you any pizza that they have the ingredients for and/or modify any pizza to add/remove any items from them, since they're making everything from scratch. Keeping in mind that there may be a charge involved for different ingredients, go nuts with all the combinations you can make! This is especially helpful for vegetarians since a lot of the pizzas just have 1 or 2 non-veg items and taste just as great without them or even with substitute ingredients. My one gripe was how long the food took, and that our pizzas were merely warm by the time they got to us, but I guess that it may have just been a one-off incident, so I'm not too concerned about it. Overall, definitely check out CPK if you're in the area and want fancy pizza! TLDR: On the pricey end, but definitely check them out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=40

The service was incredibly slow. We had the sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom pizza, which was rubbery and borderline inedible. I was starving and had a tough time bringing myself to eat a second piece. It was dry and tasteless, and stingy on the mushrooms, pepperoni, and sausage components. I will say that the California Fields salad was good, and was the highlight of the meal. The worst thing about this experience was that our waitress did not seem to care about us. She never came back to check on us once the food was delivered. When she dropped off the food, our beers were empty, and she did not ask if we wanted another drink. Since she never came back, we did not receive another drink, so out the window went our pizza and beer date. We observed her several times bs'ing inside with co-workers.

Merv R.,"Orlando, FL",31,42,232,3.0,6/1/2010,"Picked up my girl and went for lunch at 1130 to beat the noon rush.  I had a cup of coffee first and my girl had the raspberry iced tea.  Coffee was piping hot and fresh.  Nice job! We ordered the lettuce wraps and upon recommendation by the waiter, the steamed Ginger dumplings.  As I sat there  contemplating why I ordered such a ""normal"" appetizer, I was shocked to realize that it's my first recommendation taken.  Need to not listen next time, the dumplings weren't anything spectacular (server said it was a personal favorite) for me.  The lettuce wraps however, were quite good, although a bit oily for the stir fried chicken and shrimp filling which we had.  The Ginger dressing that came on the side was a bit strong-  it's a good thing it was on the side.  The filling was fine without it, but as mentioned above, it was quite oily.  Next entree was the Moroccan salad.  It had dates, butternut squash, almonds, Moroccan spiced chicken, beets, eggs and romaine lettuce.  The dressing was nice, but the amalgamation of all the ingredients made it even better.  The salad was also a palate cleanser.  It's one of the better salads if you ask me, great by itself or after a heavy meal (burgers/fries, ribs, or anything fried or oily).   The service was decent, and after learning that service goes down as more people come in, we received enough attention to have a decent lunch.  Only problem we ran into was that we paid with a hundred dollar bill.  Our tab came out to be $38.31, but received only $61 back.  That's right, we didn't get any coins back- did it bother me?  It was the principle.  Of course.  We still left a $7 tip.  We were gonna leave the change anyways, but did the place really have no change or was it just plain laziness on the server's part?      A side note for the calorie concious: Their menu had a nice touch of adding carb and fat calories, proteins, sugar and sodium etc.  I don't know if it's a Northeast thing, but the CPK we went to in Florida didn't have a menu like that. It would be safe to assume that the calorie counts are averages, because cooks can be heavy handed at times, and they all differ!  Our oily lettuce wrap chicken and shrimp filling came to mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=40

Also had the fish tacos with avocado - it's nice that someplace in the area has these. The key lime pie for dessert wasn't too tart like it often can be.

Meg F.,"Collingswood, NJ",38,168,4,1.0,6/7/2011,"tl;dr= Don't trust them with your credit card FYI- The restaurant had less than 1/4 of their tables occupied. A friend and I sit outside and place our order with no problems.  A friend and I both ordered paninis and decided to get a side caesar salad (a soup or salad is included with the panini).   We waited OVER a half an hour for our caesar salads to come out-- I have no idea why it took so long.  Washing lettuce, sprinkling parmesan cheese, and throwing a few croutons and some dressing onto a plate should not take a half an hour.  The waitress apologized, but seemed to be a bit out of it.  The panini came out the same time the caesar salad did, which shouldn't happen.  I ate the caesar salad first, which was acceptable; nothing fancy, just a plain caesar salad.  Oddly enough, my caesar salad was on a separate plate than my panini, but my friend's was on the same plate as her panini; maybe because I had dressing on the side?  Who knows; that shouldn't have happened. My panini came out, and it wasn't hot; in fact, it was at room temperature, if not a bit cold.  My friends was the same temperature, but she didn't mind; she prefers to eat her paninis cold.  After waiting about 6-7 minutes for the waitress to come and check on us, I asked the waitress if the panini was supposed to be served hot.  She said yes (duh, I knew this, just wanted her to admit it). The waitress offered to reheat it, and I agreed.   About 7-8 minutes later my panini arrives.  My waitress literally runs away  from my table before checking to see if the panini was heated to my liking.  I take another bite and it's still cold (btw-same panini, bite marks and all, not a new panini--hope they didn't ""reheat"" it on a panini press used on other paninis...).  A few minutes later the waitress comes back again and asks if we enjoy our meal (and doesn't ask anything specific about my meal--another no-no).  Once again, the waitress seems very out of it.  I told her that my panini is cold, again.  The waitress, in her dazed state, offered to take my panini back to the kitchen for the second time.  I declined; I wasn't going to have the kitchen and this waitress and any staff in the back handle my panini for a third time.  I was offered another meal but I declined; my friend was nearly done her meal, and I did not want to wait even longer for a replacement meal.  I was then offered a to-go meal but I declined that as well, because I really didn't want to bring any food made at  that CPK home.  The waitress then told me she wouldn't charge me for the panini.  I offered to pay for the caesar salad, but she said she would take it off the bill. My friend had no issues with her panini. The bill came about ten minutes later.  I immediately check the bill and verify that the only item on the bill is my friend's panini.  I take out my debit card to pay and put it in the debit card slot at the top of the bill holder.  A few minutes later the waitress comes back to collect the bill and card, and takes about 5 minutes to return it.   When the bill is returned for me to sign, I tip $1.50 (total bill was $10ish; I ALWAYS tip 20%, but because of the lousy service I only tipped 15%).  It was then that i notice that my debit card was nowhere to be found, even though it had just been swiped to pay for the meal. I jump out of my chair and start running towards the door to get back into the indoors section of CPK so I can find the waitress.  As I was walking into the door another waitress comes out, flashing my card around.  Apparently it was found ON THE FLOOR!  My waitress had apparently dropped the card and not noticed (duh--that's why the card  slot is designed so that credit cards stick out of the bill keeper to avoid this situation).  The other waitress gave me the card back, almost too easily. A few minutes later (2-3 after getting my debit card back), my original waitress comes back and apologizes for dropping the card.  I nicely explain to her what could have happened (someone could have written down the credit card info and thrown it back on the floor and used my info at a later date), but she didn't seem to care too much.  She offered to have a manager come over, but what good would that have done to me?  Yes, I could have complained about her, and that would have made me feel a whole lot better.  I probably should have complained.  At that point, I just wanted to leave and I didn't want to deal with BS from a manager who was just going to offer me free meals anyway. At that point I knew I would never set foot into another CPK again.  It was then I knew I'd use my #socialmedia skills and post this review on Yelp; this single review + my word of mouth will reach hundreds and will hopefully dissuade others from going to CPK.

First of all, props to PA for requiring calorie counts on menus in restaurants. Holy crap. Amazing how when you think something might be semi-healthy then see the calories, you realize its no wonder you haven't lost any weight. But the real highlight of the decision process was realizing that you can get any of the pizzas with thin crust and its 170 calories less. Score! Two friends both got the fresh tomato and cheese pizza, and I got the wild mushroom plus bacon (which probably cancelled out the thin crust calories, but whatever). We all ate WAY too much, and then shared out leftovers with the young homeless guys digging through the trash cans outside. And it looked like we were not the only ones to do so, which made me feel really good about people. All in all, good service, a nice clean restaurant, and tasty food. What I'd expect from a chain, nothing less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=60

Raquel S.,"Philadelphia, PA",49,219,8,3.0,2/16/2012,"On our way into Chipotle, my boyfriend and I smelled something incredible. It was a little snowy and I knew a more romantic lunch would be the perfect start to our afternoon together.  I was really excited by all of the combinations of ingredients and found a lot of flavor combinations I was interested in.  The food--The main reason people come out to eat should be for the taste of the food.  We ordered the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza and the Gorgonzola Cheese and Pear. He and I both love garlic, but when I tell you it was garlicky--it was in the way that bites you back. It was so strong that I could still smell the garlic on his breath after eating, even though I ate some, too. The pear and gorgonzola pizza was a great combination of salty and sweet. The little spring mixed in a mayo dressing that tasted like straight up mayo could have been done without.  I didn't really love CPK's pizza's but I didn't not like them, either. Was lunch for two worth $50? Probably not. Was it worth the calories? Also, probably not. I think this is one of those places where if you are habitual with what you eat, you might crave. Like other chain restaurants like TGIFridays, they push their sugary drinks. There seemed to be a lot of added chemicals in the crust. We barely had a piece and a half each before we started feeling full. As soon as we got in the car, I took a nap on the way to the King of Prussia Mall... When I ate some left overs for breakfast the next day, I fell back asleep almost immediately.. I am not one who ever takes a nap so I actually do wonder why this happened both times after I ate their food.

When we sat down, the waitress--luckily--noticed that the seat where my boyfriend was about to sit was wet, so she wiped it off. Doesn't that seem like something that would be done before seating us? Anyway, we ordered--a pepperoni pizza for me, and a BBQ chicken pizza for him. The menu lists the calorie count for everything which is good and bad--mostly bad, because it's all over 1,000 calories, pretty much. We agreed that it was pretty meh--mine was extremely greasy. We decided to get dessert, from a surprisingly limited menu (only one chocolate option? How dare you call yourself a restaurant!) The menu did include butter cake, which--spoiler alert--has a whole stinking lot of calories. We went with the red velvet cake, which was pretty unmemorable (case in point: I had to go on their website just now to remember what we actually ordered...and it was only 2 nights ago that we went.)

I asked for a table with an umbrella and after just a few minutes they cleared off a table with an umbrella.  Lunch time is fairly crowded.  My dad really likes the Cobb salad here.  He adds salami to it and never complains about the meal.  He enjoys it.  Don't think anything amazing but solid.   I also enjoy the Cobb salad here.  I've been drinking some more Arnold palmers recently and I got it here.  It was a good mix of lemonade and tea.

The pita bread had the consistency of a soft leather handbag and the hummus has tomato blended into it. The pita bread was alright but I didn't like the sweetness of the hummus. My dad also got the duo with mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza and the farmers market soup. The pizza needed more sauce and didn't have much flavor. He liked the soup, however but it was not spectacular. The portion size was reasonable. I would take this lunch duo over Panera bread's. The atmosphere is classy but also casual.

Anyway, I got the jerk chicken thin crust pizza and my friend got the jambalaya pasta. The pizza was oddly sweet, like I could taste the sugar. Now maybe it was because I didn't get bacon.

Foodimus M.,"Philadelphia, United States",14,141,816,3.0,26/9/2013,"Three words of advice regarding this place: ORDER A PIZZA. I have been here several times and, until recently, didn't take my own advice. There's lots of variety on the menu, and most things are pretty decent, considering it's a chain, and at least they are consistent. The dumplings are good, as is the chinese chicken salad. Besides a range of cocktails and beers, their drinks menu also has ""italian sodas"" with seltzer and sugar-free syrups which are really spectacular, and inspired me to start ordering my own Torani flavored syrups in bulk to make them at home.  Service in the restaurant is hit or miss - some servers have been friendly, prompt, and accommodated special requests, while others have been slow and unresponsive. It doesn't seem to matter whether the restaurant is busy or empty either. Takeout service late at night is also a bit slack, but they are open until 10 which is convenient for me.  You know when you're going here you're eating at a chain, and in the ranks of chains, I think this is pretty decent food. I think that even more now that I finally discovered the pizzas (DUH, what was I waiting for?). The pear and gorgonzola pizza was DELICIOUS, and it's the flat dough that I really go in for.  If you're around from shopping at Target and need a quick bite, or driving in or out from the city, I think this is as good a place to stop and eat as any - the rest of the spots in this mini-mall complex are also chains but far poorer choices in my opinion (gross chain burritos, anyone?). Also, as a chain, they're required to post their calorie counts on the menu, which is a plus for me because even if I don't adjust my food choices accordingly, I can at least be aware of what I'm doing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=20
Michelle P.,"Philadelphia, United States",432,1148,4433,3.0,29/10/2013,"I recently got to pick the spot for a lunch with coworkers. For whatever reason, I picked California Pizza Kitchen. Maybe convenience? I struggle each time with the menu because the pesky, but helpful nutrition facts. Unless you plan on having just a soda or a side dish of grilled chicken/shrimp, don't expect to walk away with a meal for under 20 grams of fat. Even the salads are high calorie/high fat.  I opted for the Fire-Roasted Chile Relleno off the ""Lite Adventures"" menu which is fairly low-cal but is packed with 27 grams of fat. I've had it before and knew it was tasty and the dish did not disappointed. I wish I snapped a picture because the presentation was killer. It was the perfect looking fall dish: a plump green chile stuffed with eggplant, cheese, chicken, beans, corn and other veggies sitting in a plate of avocado salsa verde and cilantro. I guess the avocado makes it a good fat :) It was a creamy but not heavy sauce. The dish was the perfect sized lunch too. I left feeling full but not stuffed.  This is a popular work lunch spot, so our server kept everything moving. We had a half table/half booth on the end, which she did awkwardly reach over several times. I guess there wasn't really room to go around the other way? She was pleasant and checked on us several time so I really have no complaints there.

Abhishek Y.,"Philadelphia, United States",117,165,6,4.0,10/7/2013,"I've only been to this location once, but it was a great all around experience, and I'd definitely recommend it! CPK is a national chain of restaurants for specialty pizza and other related food items (pastas, salads, etc.). They tend to be on the pricier end, but some of their pizzas are pretty darn good, and certainly justify their price tag. At this location, I've found the veggie on the honey wheat crust and the tostada pizza to both be great. Both are veggie friendly pizzas (provided your local establishment doesn't use anchovies in the ranch for the tostada), and they're both off the hook amazing. The tostada is especially awesome. A layer of beans, crunchy lettuce and tomatoes, ranch, and crispy tortilla strips bring it all together in a wonderful combination. Tip: they're glad to actually make you any pizza that they have the ingredients for and/or modify any pizza to add/remove any items from them, since they're making everything from scratch. Keeping in mind that there may be a charge involved for different ingredients, go nuts with all the combinations you can make! This is especially helpful for vegetarians since a lot of the pizzas just have 1 or 2 non-veg items and taste just as great without them or even with substitute ingredients. My one gripe was how long the food took, and that our pizzas were merely warm by the time they got to us, but I guess that it may have just been a one-off incident, so I'm not too concerned about it. Overall, definitely check out CPK if you're in the area and want fancy pizza!

We ordered the lettuce wraps and upon recommendation by the waiter, the steamed Ginger dumplings.  As I sat there  contemplating why I ordered such a ""normal"" appetizer, I was shocked to realize that it's my first recommendation taken.  Need to not listen next time, the dumplings weren't anything spectacular (server said it was a personal favorite) for me.  The lettuce wraps however, were quite good, although a bit oily for the stir fried chicken and shrimp filling which we had.  The Ginger dressing that came on the side was a bit strong-  it's a good thing it was on the side.  The filling was fine without it, but as mentioned above, it was quite oily.  Next entree was the Moroccan salad.  It had dates, butternut squash, almonds, Moroccan spiced chicken, beets, eggs and romaine lettuce.  The dressing was nice, but the amalgamation of all the ingredients made it even better.  The salad was also a palate cleanser.  It's one of the better salads if you ask me, great by itself or after a heavy meal (burgers/fries, ribs, or anything fried or oily).   The service was decent, and after learning that service goes down as more people come in, we received enough attention to have a decent lunch.  Only problem we ran into was that we paid with a hundred dollar bill.  Our tab came out to be $38.31, but received only $61 back.  That's right, we didn't get any coins back- did it bother me?  It was the principle.  Of course.  We still left a $7 tip.  We were gonna leave the change anyways, but did the place really have no change or was it just plain laziness on the server's part?      A side note for the calorie concious: Their menu had a nice touch of adding carb and fat calories, proteins, sugar and sodium etc.  I don't know if it's a Northeast thing, but the CPK we went to in Florida didn't have a menu like that. It would be safe to assume that the calorie counts are averages, because cooks can be heavy handed at times, and they all differ!  Our oily lettuce wrap chicken and shrimp filling came to mind.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=40

I will say, though, our server was FANTASTIC, and super patient with our indecision.  I started off with the white corn guac - I didn't really need an appetizer, but I was cranky and needed to take my meds, so i really didn't want to wait for a my pizza. I'm glad I did, though - it was REALLY good. Not so much a guac as kind of a salad with chunks of avocado and white corn - not pureed, just kinda mixed. I'm gonna be digging up the recipe later.  First of all, props to PA for requiring calorie counts on menus in restaurants. Holy crap. Amazing how when you think something might be semi-healthy then see the calories, you realize its no wonder you haven't lost any weight. But the real highlight of the decision process was realizing that you can get any of the pizzas with thin crust and its 170 calories less. Score! Two friends both got the fresh tomato and cheese pizza, and I got the wild mushroom plus bacon (which probably cancelled out the thin crust calories, but whatever). We all ate WAY too much, and then shared out leftovers with the young homeless guys digging through the trash cans outside. And it looked like we were not the only ones to do so, which made me feel really good about people. All in all, good service, a nice clean restaurant, and tasty food.

Raquel S.,"Philadelphia, United States",49,219,8,3.0,16/2/2012,"On our way into Chipotle, my boyfriend and I smelled something incredible. It was a little snowy and I knew a more romantic lunch would be the perfect start to our afternoon together.  I was really excited by all of the combinations of ingredients and found a lot of flavor combinations I was interested in.  The food--The main reason people come out to eat should be for the taste of the food.  We ordered the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza and the Gorgonzola Cheese and Pear. He and I both love garlic, but when I tell you it was garlicky--it was in the way that bites you back. It was so strong that I could still smell the garlic on his breath after eating, even though I ate some, too. The pear and gorgonzola pizza was a great combination of salty and sweet. The little spring mixed in a mayo dressing that tasted like straight up mayo could have been done without.  I didn't really love CPK's pizza's but I didn't not like them, either. Was lunch for two worth $50? Probably not. Was it worth the calories? Also, probably not. I think this is one of those places where if you are habitual with what you eat, you might crave. Like other chain restaurants like TGIFridays, they push their sugary drinks. There seemed to be a lot of added chemicals in the crust. We barely had a piece and a half each before we started feeling full. As soon as we got in the car, I took a nap on the way to the King of Prussia Mall... When I ate some left overs for breakfast the next day, I fell back asleep almost immediately.. I am not one who ever takes a nap so I actually do wonder why this happened both times after I ate their food.

When we sat down, the waitress--luckily--noticed that the seat where my boyfriend was about to sit was wet, so she wiped it off. Doesn't that seem like something that would be done before seating us? Anyway, we ordered--a pepperoni pizza for me, and a BBQ chicken pizza for him. The menu lists the calorie count for everything which is good and bad--mostly bad, because it's all over 1,000 calories, pretty much. We agreed that it was pretty meh--mine was extremely greasy. We decided to get dessert, from a surprisingly limited menu (only one chocolate option? How dare you call yourself a restaurant!) The menu did include butter cake, which--spoiler alert--has a whole stinking lot of calories. We went with the red velvet cake, which was pretty unmemorable (case in point: I had to go on their website just now to remember what we actually ordered...and it was only 2 nights ago that we went.)

Surprisingly, my egg rolls came out in less than 5 minutes - I even made a comment to my server, but he didn't seem to understand that it was a concern for me. The egg rolls were pretty hot, but two out of the six pieces were a bit soggy while the rest were quite crispy. I attribute that to the oh-so-fast delivery time.

Meg F.,"Collingswood, United States",38,168,4,1.0,7/6/2011,"tl;dr= Don't trust them with your credit card FYI- The restaurant had less than 1/4 of their tables occupied. A friend and I sit outside and place our order with no problems.  A friend and I both ordered paninis and decided to get a side caesar salad (a soup or salad is included with the panini).   We waited OVER a half an hour for our caesar salads to come out-- I have no idea why it took so long.  Washing lettuce, sprinkling parmesan cheese, and throwing a few croutons and some dressing onto a plate should not take a half an hour.  The waitress apologized, but seemed to be a bit out of it.  The panini came out the same time the caesar salad did, which shouldn't happen.  I ate the caesar salad first, which was acceptable; nothing fancy, just a plain caesar salad.  Oddly enough, my caesar salad was on a separate plate than my panini, but my friend's was on the same plate as her panini; maybe because I had dressing on the side?  Who knows; that shouldn't have happened. My panini came out, and it wasn't hot; in fact, it was at room temperature, if not a bit cold.  My friends was the same temperature, but she didn't mind; she prefers to eat her paninis cold.  After waiting about 6-7 minutes for the waitress to come and check on us, I asked the waitress if the panini was supposed to be served hot.  She said yes (duh, I knew this, just wanted her to admit it). The waitress offered to reheat it, and I agreed.   About 7-8 minutes later my panini arrives.  My waitress literally runs away  from my table before checking to see if the panini was heated to my liking.  I take another bite and it's still cold (btw-same panini, bite marks and all, not a new panini--hope they didn't ""reheat"" it on a panini press used on other paninis...).  A few minutes later the waitress comes back again and asks if we enjoy our meal (and doesn't ask anything specific about my meal--another no-no).  Once again, the waitress seems very out of it.  I told her that my panini is cold, again.  The waitress, in her dazed state, offered to take my panini back to the kitchen for the second time.  I declined; I wasn't going to have the kitchen and this waitress and any staff in the back handle my panini for a third time.  I was offered another meal but I declined; my friend was nearly done her meal, and I did not want to wait even longer for a replacement meal.  I was then offered a to-go meal but I declined that as well, because I really didn't want to bring any food made at  that CPK home.  The waitress then told me she wouldn't charge me for the panini.  I offered to pay for the caesar salad, but she said she would take it off the bill. My friend had no issues with her panini. The bill came about ten minutes later.  I immediately check the bill and verify that the only item on the bill is my friend's panini.  I take out my debit card to pay and put it in the debit card slot at the top of the bill holder.  A few minutes later the waitress comes back to collect the bill and card, and takes about 5 minutes to return it.   When the bill is returned for me to sign, I tip $1.50 (total bill was $10ish; I ALWAYS tip 20%, but because of the lousy service I only tipped 15%).  It was then that i notice that my debit card was nowhere to be found, even though it had just been swiped to pay for the meal. I jump out of my chair and start running towards the door to get back into the indoors section of CPK so I can find the waitress.  As I was walking into the door another waitress comes out, flashing my card around.  Apparently it was found ON THE FLOOR!  My waitress had apparently dropped the card and not noticed (duh--that's why the card  slot is designed so that credit cards stick out of the bill keeper to avoid this situation).  The other waitress gave me the card back, almost too easily. A few minutes later (2-3 after getting my debit card back), my original waitress comes back and apologizes for dropping the card.  I nicely explain to her what could have happened (someone could have written down the credit card info and thrown it back on the floor and used my info at a later date), but she didn't seem to care too much.  She offered to have a manager come over, but what good would that have done to me?  Yes, I could have complained about her, and that would have made me feel a whole lot better.  I probably should have complained.  At that point, I just wanted to leave and I didn't want to deal with BS from a manager who was just going to offer me free meals anyway. At that point I knew I would never set foot into another CPK again.  It was then I knew I'd use my #socialmedia skills and post this review on Yelp; this single review + my word of mouth will reach hundreds and will hopefully dissuade others from going to CPK.

Ron P.,"Easton, United States",0,3,,4.0,22/9/2013,"Late night visit to CPK paid off for my, wife, daughter and me.  We had the Habenero Carnita, mushroom and Sicilian pizzas.  All were good.  Meal and service was very good.  John our waiter was great!  We came in close to closing and it was not a problem.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=100
Mandi C.,"Flemington, United States",7,41,1,4.0,18/1/2009,"My boyfriend and I both love this place! The selection here is really nice, both food-wise and drink-wise. We mostly go for the pizza (His favorite is the Jamaican Jerk pizza, mine's the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza) rather than the pasta dishes, but both are really good. There are a lot of drinks too, from Italian sodas to specialty blended drinks (I did like the banana chocolate one, actually) to teas and coffee.  The atmosphere is nice, usually pretty full but not uncomfortably so, and the wait is rarely bad.  Oh, and one more thing, the egg roll appetizers are fabulous!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=100
Ann T.,"Havertown, United States",0,30,,2.0,27/2/2013,"This place has really gone downhill.  We went for a late lunch today(around 4PM) and there were only 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant.  We were approached immediately and ordered tea.  We were never asked if we wanted water, also.  I ordered a pasta dish of spagghettini, asparagus and spinach.  My husband ordered pork tacos.  His tacos were ok.  My spaghetti was cold and hard.  I was trying to send it back to be heated but the waitress never came back to the table.  I finally caught her attention after my husband had finished his meal and ask her if they could warm it up.  She took it back but I don't think they did a thing, because it was the exact same temperature as before.  The waitress never came back to ask if we wanted more tea or to ask how things were.  She finally came back and plunked the bill on the table.  I think she hates her job.  I used to like this place but no more! What a shame.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=100
Steve P.,"Mechanicsburg, United States",225,400,1029,4.0,16/10/2009,"A nice little spot tucked away in the middle of a shopping complex that you would never know was there unless you kept a keen eye on all the other electronic signs around. Service was pretty good here, They were a little behind on getting the table top wiped off and did the wipe off as I was sitting down. Food was delivered quickly and made right. I hate places that cant seem to cut completely through their pizzas and I didn't have that problem here so it's all good. My fiancee got the wild mushroom pizza and loved it as well.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=100
Paul B.,"Havertown, United States",0,51,,5.0,28/6/2013,Mmmmm! Great food. Have loves this place since I was a little kid. I will be back again and again. You must give it a try! You will enjoy it.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=100
Alex V.,"Wayne, United States",109,353,54,3.0,28/5/2009,"Its California Pizza Kitchen. Good, but overpriced mini pizzas with a wide variety of toppings. The salads are ok, and the pasta is about the same quality as your local Olive Garden. This location has a good outdoor seating setup.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=100
Becky S.,"Manhattan, United States",7,123,9,4.0,10/2/2009,"Great place - easy to park, good atmosphere, etc. The salads are large and fresh and the pizzas are delicious. The staff has always been very nice to me. If you've been to one CPK you have been to them all in terms of food quality but the ease of this place makes it better than others that have long waits etc.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-philadelphia?start=100
