Yaneli V.,"Houston, TX",62,98,77,3.0,7/15/2017,"Stopped by for dinner at around 8, it was busy as we expected but we were seated immediately. The food took awhile but it was expected. The service was really good Out waiter was nice and attentive.  I had the Quesadilla Explosion Salad, ehhh lacked flavor but it was very filling.  I was very disappointed on our drinks, we both ordered one of their summer drinks, the watermelon cooler. It was sweet and refreshing BUT it had no alcohol, basically agua de sandia (watermelon water). Next time I'll stick to the regular drink menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Ralph S.,"Spring, TX",14,8,,2.0,1/9/2018,"This location is real hit or miss. I've gone sometimes and it has been fantastic. Other times, it has horrible service and I can't even find a hostess to seat me.  Some days it is a 5 star, but others a 1 star. For the inconsistency, I'm giving it 2 stars as I only go here when everywhere else is closed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Ernesto G.,"Houston, TX",101,2,2,1.0,1/5/2018,Ordered online for pick up. If you order via the app it will always shows it is not available for this location. It's 7:32pm on a Friday so I understand they are busy on the pick up side but there should be no reason why I have not been acknowledged while standing in the pick up section for at least 20 minutes. Once someone finally greeted me the order wasn't even ready and had to wait another 20 minutes. This is ridiculous!  Update: To top it off my order was missing items and was completely wrong.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Ryan H.,"Spring, TX",0,4,,2.0,1/4/2018,"Carry out: We got chickens tenders cut up into small pieces in place of our fried pickles. I'm not sure why they couldn't just tell me they were out of pickles and take it off my bill. I guess they were trying to fool us and hope we wouldn't notice the pickles tasted like chicken. Also one of our sides was supposed to be mashed potatoes but we just got a bunch of fries....Ticket number 980087, 1/4/2018 6:50pm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39

Mi M.,"Cypress, TX",0,29,57,5.0,9/3/2017,"The food here is always perfect. I order the chipotle steak and shrimp with asparagus. I love their lemonades and Arnold Palmer. It is a bit noisy, but most Chili's restaurants are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Ebone' W.,"Frisco, TX",123,143,118,1.0,3/27/2017,"Yeah, this place is pretty horrible. All I wanted was dessert, so I ordered the skillet chocolate chip cookie. The wait wasn't that long, but by reading reviews you can tell service and waiting is an issue, so maybe that's why they are so pressed to get everything out quickly.  My first cookie was raw, so I returned it and patiently waited for another.  The second, same thing. The bartender tried to make it right by offering something else, but NAH, I'm good. I left.  I didn't know baking cookies were so difficult.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Peter H.,"Houston, TX",72,65,43,2.0,5/6/2017,"OK, so it was my ""diet cheat day"" and I thought I'd visit the Chili's in my neighborhood. Short version: It's your typical Chili's, but between the lazy bartender and the equally lazy waitstaff, I'll avoid this place in the future. Long version: It's Chili's. It's a chain. The food is the same everywhere. We get that. However, THIS location leaves a LOT to be desired. Let's start with the bartender. As Yelpers know about me, I (a) always sit at the bar if I'm by myself and (b) give the waitstaff 5 minutes to either acknowledge me or give me a menu before I leave.  This location almost got the ""Peter Hughes Exit"" penalty. I waited for almost 5 minutes before the bartender even showed up - and he was about to address a man who came in just 30 seconds earlier! The manager on duty wasn't any help either. While I was waiting in vain to be assisted at the empty bar - yes, I was the only one there at the time - she didn't even say hi or even ask if I needed anything. When I asked her point-blank if anyone was bartending, she just replied: ""Oh, I'll go get him"" (meaning the bartender) - and she too disappeared. Oh, hell-to-the-no! ZAP - one star gone. The bartender - Felipe, if my receipt is correct - needed some help in a big way. When I asked him which beers were on tap, he just pointed to the wall. Oh, uh, OK - I'll take THAT one. Felipe may pour some great drinks, but being ""customer focused"" is not his strong point. I think it's a symptom of a bigger issue. The rest of the waitstaff was more interested in watching ESPN than serving their customers. While the manager on duty was busy cleaning and busing tables, the staff was watching TV. If anything else, I was going to ""pic-shame"" them and post it on Yelp. I was about to snap a picture on the down-low but I think they noticed that I was aiming in their direction and they scattered like cockroaches. ZAP - second star gone. Of course, Felipe was busy chatting with his regulars than to ask if I wanted a second beer, pour me some extra water or deliver more napkins without being told by me. If he had been attentive, I would have given him some extra padding for his tip. Nope - I had to ask for everything. ZAP - third star gone. Good thing I'm a Plenti member, since I got at least something for my troubles. But if I'm going to go to a Chili's in the future, it will be the one on 290 - with a nicer manager and sharp bartender - or the one on the Southwest Freeway, which also has great service and a very attentive lunchtime bartender. But I digress. Bottom line: I sure as heck won't be coming back here, unless serious changes to customer attention are made.   Personally, I think that GM David Hulsey needs to have a conference with his front-of-the-house help. IMMEDIATELY. All of these low-star reviews are valid, in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Danielle D.,"Houston, TX",236,110,106,1.0,6/4/2017,"Upon seating us they told us our waiter's name. We waited about 10 mins before meeting him. A host finally came to take our drink orders and delivered them to us. We still hadn't met the waiter. Our drinks were never refilled the whole meal. Our appetizer was served with our meal. Fried pickles were lightly breaded and quite good, my prime rib mex bowl was heavy on the onions and the meat looked like it was meant for a stew. I would not recommend or re-order. My boyfriend got the salmon and he didn't voice any complaints or praise. I'm writing the review as we wait to ask for the check. Our waiter must be overworked because we only saw him the one time he took our order (for everything at once since it had taken him so long to arrive). Someone else had dropped off our food and we literally haven't seen him since. He hasn't checked in or cleared any plates. These chains should really invest in the pay at the table option like our friends at Olive Garden so when we don't see the waiter to ask for the check we can at least pay and leave on time. We asked for the check twice and the first time he said ""ok"" the second time he said ""I got you guys."" Sorry but no. You obviously don't got us.  Really poor service tonight. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Tressa E.,"Houston, TX",49,38,18,4.0,1/19/2017,"I love that Chilli's has these Kiosks to re order. This particular location was great because it wasn't packed and the Bartender who also to my order was very attentive to me as well as the family behind me who took forever to order and has lots of request. I had the lunch double burger and salad and fries and it was good, fresh and so glad my salad wasn't all brown and old  like other locations I visited (Hwy 6).  I work around the corner and felt really stupid I didn't realize it was there all this time. Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Rena G.,"Houston, TX",206,166,266,1.0,4/29/2016,"Total waste of time coming to this location.  I would stop there but sadly there's so much more to say. We stopped here yesterday (04/28/16) after running errands in the area. It was our first visit to this location and we should have known better judging from the lack of cars in the parking lot during the time that you would figure a restaurant to be busiest.  First off, when we walked in, we saw that hardly any customers were there and there was no one in sight at the hostess stand, except a cleaning bucket and spray on the stand. (o......k) Finally a guy, who turned out to be our waiter came to have us seated. He said we could choose wherever we wanted but then when we chose a booth by the window he said ""Oh no, that section is closed."" So we just picked another table and sat down. He brought us our waters and then my bf asked him for a beer on draft (that was listed as a draft beer on the menu) and the waiter said that they didn't have it. Ok. So we asked which beers DID THEY ACTUALLY HAVE on draft and he said he would check after he put in our meal order annnnnnnnnnd he never came back.  I ordered the Pasilla Chicken off of their ""Lighter Choices"" menu with steamed broccoli and their warm quinoa wheat berry blend, and my bf ordered the 10oz Classic Sirloin. Once we got our food, our waiter puts my plate in front of me and tells me ""Oh we didn't have the quinoa so I just brought you rice, is that ok?"" Um no, it's not. When restaurants run out of something, it's not a big deal to me since normally I find something else to substitute, but the waiter usually will let you know in advance what they ran out of and they will let you choose something else. Don't just assume what you think I will want. That rubbed me the wrong way.  I told him that I didn't want the rice and I politely asked for a house salad. At least my bf's order was correct and they brought him everything that he wanted. The whole dining experience was just off. Our waiter would take his time to come check on us but he found time to SIT DOWN next to another table and chat with the people eating at another booth. I noticed that there seemed to be quite a few employees standing around and joking with one another rather than working or checking on the other patrons, given, there were not many people in the restaurant but now I see why.  After reading other people's experience at this location, I REGRET not checking yelp before coming here. We should have known better but now at least we know. First and last time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Ry M.,"Houston, TX",0,45,1,4.0,7/10/2017,We went on Thursday night for $5 margaritas. The service was okay just a few issues. I did have several issues with my margarita(they were out of what I originally ordered then brought the wrong flavor). My salad was pretty good. We got dessert and it was kinda mediocre.  I've also ordered carry out several times and had a few issues. One time they completed forgot my sides and were kinda rude when I brought it up.

Chris D.,"San Antonio, TX",77,6,,1.0,6/24/2017,"Hostess didn't greet us at the door, 20 minute wait for our drink order to be taken. Bartender had 4 people at the bar and couldn't take our drink order. Finally the bartender headed in our direction and helped every table around before she got to us. My wife was gone and she asked if I wanted to wait to order till she got back. I said yes and at the very moment my wife sat at the table and she still walked away. 15 minutes later she comes back to take my order. Very unprofessional.  I hate to not tip but this service does not deserve one. And the manager pass my table 4 time and we didn't even have a drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39
Linda E.,"Houston, TX",508,547,2455,1.0,3/17/2016,"This is the worst Chili location I have been to. Not because of the food, since this is pretty much chili corporate standard.  However, they strongly lack in customer service.  We walked in and waited for a hostess to appear.  Meanwhile, several employees from the bar area kept on with their personal conversations and never said anything.  So we walked over to the bar area and asked is anyone going to seat us?  The hostess was among them conversating  and rudely said someone will be there shortly.  Shortly as in when she wraps up the conversation.  After we were finally seated we ordered the usual stuff that Chilli has to offer.  But the beginning totally soured my mood.  The food is standard but the employees attitudes are substandard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39

Ben E.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,3.0,6/8/2017,"Wife, daughter and I visited on Sunday, June 4, 2017.  We had issues.   I gave three stars, as opposed to one star, for the following reasons: 1. In the past, we have had consistently great service and fair to good wait timing. 2. The wait staff bust their ass every time we go there, including this time.  However, this should not negate the poor service reviews provided by others.  We have had cool tattooed waiter and waitress staff that really worked hard and provided great service in the past.   The waitress on this day was awesome and perfect.  She knew the specials and could recite them correctly spot on from memory.   She was prompt with no dilly dally. 3. We like the place.  And again, we had an awesome waitress. Now, the ding in stars (only 3 stars) is because we had issues.  We went here because my wife had a craving and we had a coupon for a free kids menu.   The hostess said that we could only have a high chair at a table with chairs, not a booth table.  The hostess said the issue had to do with the height of the booth table tops.  My wife and I said we want a booth, let's try the high chair with the booth.  We had to talk real sweet and patiently to try to convince the hostess to let us have a high chair at a booth.   This was our first compromise in staying and not leaving.  This was a little uncomfortable, because we have eaten a lot of times at Chili's over the past year, and we have not run across this issue before.  Chili's had not changed out their tables recently, and the booth tables were at the same exact height as the tables with the individual chairs.   Maybe we entered into the Twilight Zone, becasue the interaction was weird. So we ordered a kids meal and two adult entrees.   The waitress brings the drinks promptly.  Short time later the pineapple (side) for our daughter's kids meal arrives with the rest of her meal.  However, the bowl with teh pineapple looked a little dirty and there are a couple of chopped peepers on the pineapple.  So we dismiss it (unfortunately) and satyed.  This was our second compromise. I had a salad with my meal.  I asked for no cucumber and the dressing on the side.  The salad arrived shortly after our daughter's kids meal.  When I poured the dressing on the salad, there were large chunks of cucumber at the bottom of the dressing container (cup).  I thought someone in the kitchen is messing with us.  I started to pick the cucumber out (start of third compromise), but I said to my wife, ""no, that's it. I am not letting the rest of the meal go on like this.  What ele is next?  We are leaving.""  I had the same salad dressing before, and it did not have the cucumber in it, nor does the dressing recipe call for large chunks of cucumber. We only received drinks, the kids meal side of pineapple, the kids meal, and the unacceptable salad.   Although my wife cut up the kids meals into small pieces for our daughter, it was not eaten.  Only one to three pineapple pieces were eaten. I got up and politely asked for a manager. I waited about 5 minutes, and our server came out from the kitchen with an order of food.  I told her the problem and said we were leaving and not paying for anything.  ""We had not eaten the (figurative) ""steak"" after the issues arose"" as Judge Judy would say.   My wife wanted to make sure the manager heard why were leaving, so we waited another 5 minutes.  The hostess advised that the manager was not available to come talk to us, because she was on the phone with the police regarding a problem / incident with another customer.  So we finally left. The thing was that the compromises were quickly adding up, and we just did not want to have any more uncomfortable things come up over the course of the meal related to the food prep and our experience.   We wanted to avoid having to continue to compromise and just let additional worse stuff go if it continued to occur.   We were really hoping the manager or the wait staff would get together and tweak out these things and maybe get onto the kitchen staff to stop the poor food prep.  What if I were allergic to cucumbers?  Would it be OK?  It was not this extremely serious for us, because I did not eat any of the salad, nor do I have that allergy.   We were not told what the problem was that had to do with the phone call to the police, but my wife and I joked about what that ""incident"" could have possibly been, in private after leaving Chili's.  Had Chili's done something similar with another customer's food that just pissed him/her off?   Who knows.   We needed the laugh after our experience.  We do not regularly pick up and leave from a restaurant due to problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39

The beef enchilada was spot on TexMex. Soup was a bit thick but tasty. The tostada was soggy so I would sub with a chicken enchilada next time.  The margarita was heavenly! The tostada would have deducted a star but I mentioned the soggyness to my server and she apparently informed the manager who visited my table to see if I wanted another one. I declined but appreciated the offer so they keep the star for great responsiveness.

Chad M.,"Houston, TX",581,517,214,3.0,1/18/2014,"In an attempt to eat somewhere that we haven't eaten in a long time, we chose Chili's on Katy Freeway next to Target. We arrived at lunch and received immediate seating, which was a surprise. I thought it would be packed on a Friday at noon, but surprisingly it wasn't. We got immediate service for drinks.  We had the lunch special, which has a soup/salad and a sandwich with fries (a few other options also) for about $8. That is a great lunch deal and the portions were the perfect size. I would have given this location a higher rating, but there were a few things that irked me: 1. The server was no that great - he was horrible, but he was obviously not very 'into' his job. 2. He would often walk by our table with a free hand and leave dirty dishes on the table - even though they were clearly moved to the side and ready to be removed. This happened about 5 times - so many times that we started to count. 3. We gave him the credit card to take care of the check. He then with his one free hand took food to other tables with our check and credit card in his hand. My thought that it was a perfect way to lose someone's credit card. 4. He seemed sluggish and not very quick - not the personality that I think Chili's is trying to promote. I don't know if it is a training issue for him or a job fit issue, but he could use some more training.  So the food was okay, the service was less than average, but just above being rated horrible. If we had a better service experience, I would have given another star. We would go back, but not with that server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39?start=40

She had to ask for a refund for the chips/salsa. Then when I got my food, I asked for mayonnaise and ranch. He never brought them to me. He pretty much ignored our table. Then I ordered a cheesecake to go. We paid for everything and sat there for a good 10-15 minutes longer, waiting for the cheesecake. I had to ASK him for the cheesecake.

Brandi B.,"Houston, TX",33,39,83,1.0,9/22/2015,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!! We haven't been to Chili's in years...after last night I remembered why. We had the worst possible service and quality of food ever. We walked in on a Monday night at 8pm. The restaurant was fairly empty....yet it was at least 5 min before the hostess came by to seat us. We wanted to sit in the bar area but all of the tables were dirty. She offered to clean one for us so we waited for her to clean one. It was another 5 min before she came back with a towel to clean the table. We finally sat down and quickly started looking at the menus. Another 5 min went by before anyone came by to take our drink order. He dropped off water and one of the drinks but doesn't take our food order. After another 5 min he finally comes back to take our order. We ordered fried pickles as an app, a burger and chicken crispers. 15 min go by and the pickles finally come out....soggy, greasy, and disgusting. He didn't back to check on the apps so we sat there for another 10 min with empty drinks, soggy pickles, and hunger pains. Our food came out before we were able to send back the pickles. We told him about pickles and he just said ""okay"" and walked away. He didn't offer to bring out another batch, or offer another option, or a credit.the bill. I was hoping the meal with be better than the app, but  that wasn't the case. The chicken was barely cooked, raw in some parts and felt slimey to the touch. The breading was soggy. The honey mustard sauce was watered down. The burger was overcooked. All of the food turned out so bad that i couldn't finish my meal and didn't want to bother with getting something else.

My girlfriend and I stopped by after I worked a grueling 12 hour shift. All I wanted was a beer and some crispers. We sat at the bar top. The bar was not busy at all. The bartender only had two other guest at the bar top. So I was very surprised at his behavior. I can't remember the guy's name but it does start with a B. Barney, Barry, Bart something like that. Anyway. His attitude was complete S#%T. He wasn't welcoming at all. He didn't greet us, he just threw menus and silver in front of us. He seemed to be more concerned with watching the basketball game. My girlfriend and I are both servers and we're still in our uniforms. You would think that would at least make the guy work on his tip since servers in general tend to over tip. I finally had enough of his stinky ass attitude. I paid for my beer and left.

Olu D.,"Houston, TX",1,12,3,1.0,4/24/2016,"It's amazing how accurate the rating system has proved to be. Parking in the Heights is horrible right now & I came here for a beer while I watch the Rockets playoff game. Right when I walk in I tell the hostess I want to watch the game in the bar area & she states there are no seats at the bar. Then ask me if I would like a booth on the other side. I asked her if there were any seats in the bar area at a table & she then said yes.  Once seated, I watch a guy behind me get seated at a table top & have a waitress address him. Once the waitress did come my way she ask if I need anything & I say yes, a menu & a drink menu. She points to the rack of menus which I over looked. A staff member (sweeping the floor) addressed me & tells me about the happy hour options for drinks/food. I ask her if she's the waiting staff for my table as I assume this is a conversation my waiter would have had but no. The lady who came prior & pointed at the rack of menus was my server it turns out.  At this point I notice there are SEVERAL empty seats at the bar. I approach & ask the other customers if these seats are taken & they say no.  The area hasn't been cleaned because there may have been some people who just left. No big deal, once the bar tender comes over I'm sure he'll address that.  NOPE. He grabs all the menus, including the one I brought with me. Takes the half full beer mug. Ask the guy next to me if someone was still sitting there (the seat next to me) & turns away. Ok, cool smh. A few seconds go by, maybe 30 & a trip or two past me by the bar tender. I go back to my car because I have water there & can just bring it inside. When I come back it's amazing, the area has been cleaned & menus removed. I guess he assumed I was leaving. I thought about it but no, I want to see this game.  Long story short, piss poor service & not welcoming staff (except the lady who was sweeping the floors).

The tables and floor seemed dirty and the napkins that were placed on our table had brown spots all over them. Our food took an extremely long time to come out. I think the server may have forgotten to put our order in because when it finally came out she apologized and had a manager come out with her. We didn't complain, but it was kind of annoying.  They have tablets at the tables now so that you can play games (you have to pay) and pay for your meal with your credit card at your table, but all I could think about was how covered in germs they must have been.

CrAzY!!!  I had a Chinese craving yesterday that I didn't think was worth the gas to get, so I figured that would be the ticket, but then part of me really wanted a burger.  So Yelping and GPSing my location found me driving to Taylor Street, which as an array of chain restaurants a rock throw from each other. After looking at reviews, I decided to partake of Chili's. Last time I went to a CBG the service was quick during the later part of the day, so I figured in a location with all these restaurants they would be up to par.  Well the wait was more than I anticipated for a philly cheese fries and potato soup. Waiting for my order cut  so close into my commute time to my next destination I almost cancelled the order.  While waiting at the counter contemplating if I should cancel,  could see that they were not only backed up on orders, but they had water backed up on the floor. Standing water coming from Idontknowwhere and don'twant2knowwhere but it didn't look very sanitary.  Just imagine having to work in a busy, narrow, and hot kitchen with water on the floor.  That's a safety hazard if I've even seen one! Plus the food was not that great. The fries right out the fryer tasted decent because I was hungry; the philly was too cheesy rather than meaty, and the potato soup- Well, let's just say La Madeline has spoiled me because this potato soup tasted more like instant potatoes with chunks of REAL potato (maybe) mixed in for texture. Even though I asked the employee behind the register about the soups and he suggested this one, I think I'd stick with the chili because it was fantastic the last time I went to CGB. Also, I need to drink some Sprite and go to the little girls room after eating the soup, so yeah PASS ON THE POTATO SOUP!!!!

Dana J.,"Houston, TX",1,2,2,2.0,10/9/2012,"Food was fair.Ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup when it arrived it was lukewarm, the fries weren't crispy but they were edible. Have been to other locations that were much better. Service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39?start=80
