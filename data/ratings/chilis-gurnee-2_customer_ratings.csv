40,Frank T.,"Plainfield, IL",143,150,92.0,2.0,2012-12-23,"Disappointed with this Chilis in particular. The service was slow. The chicken fajitas came out with raw onions.

41,Karen C.,"Gurnee, IL",94,43,15.0,2.0,2013-09-02,"I went there with my family at about 2PM. I went here because I had a coupon for a free dessert. It was too crowded. The four of us were seated in a booth, but I noticed that the table was sticky. My first water had small white speckles in it, but I didn't bother to say anything. I just asked for an extra water. Two of us ordered combo meals, while the other two just ordered entrees. The soup came in a timely manner of 10 minutes, but the entrees took at least 30 minutes. I was pretty surprised at the slow service since it was in the middle of the day. I ordered the $7 lunch combo southwestern mac and cheese with a small bowl of baked potato soup. Both were very salty and I ended up having to drink 2 pints of water. The portions for the combo were also very small, about the size of my open hand.  My brother ordered the chicken fajitas combo meal. It was enough for 3 small fajitas, but according to my brother, it was not very satisfying. The dinner entrees were decently sized. The south western bbq burger was tender and juicy and had plenty of toppings. My only complaints about this dish was that the fries were way too salty and that the bun was cold when we had received the order. The half slab Memphis dry rub ribs were decent, but I've obviously had better.  The molten lava cake was good. Standard bundt chocolate cake, chocolate syrup, and ice cream. Best part of the meal. So overall, just mediocre food and minimal service. I'll probably not come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=40,1.864,1.864,1.864,1.864,1.864

37,Raymond M.,"Chicago, IL",10,23,49.0,3.0,2014-02-12,"After a long gruesome day of shopping at Gurnee Mills, my sister and I decided to eat here as it would be really late to eat dinner at home. It has been a really, really long time since I went to Chili's. I only remember that my friends recommended the Loaded Potato Skins; that's what my sister and I started with. The Loaded Potato Skins were delicious. The 3-cheese blend was nicely melted and stringy. The Applewood smoked bacon gave it a nice crispiness and saltiness to each piece. The sour cream gave it richness. I would like it if there were more green onions; I couldn't taste the green onions because the other toppings were overpowering. A little more crispiness to the potato skins would give more dimensions to contrast the soft and warm texture of the potatoes. Then, I had the Guacamole Burger. It was difficult to eat it because the guacamole would be squished out whenever you take a big bite. I had to take many little bites; it was delicious. The guacamole was fresh and creamy. The burger was spicier than I expected from the fire-roasted jalapenos. The sautéed red & green bell peppers and caramelized onions were sweet. The meat was very juicy and had little bits of crispiness at the edges. The fries were nice; they were crispy on the outside and really soft in the inside. All the deliciousness was tied together well by the guacamole. We did not have dessert because we were full - great portions. The service was great. The server was very nice and made sure our food arrived in an appropriate time. She comes by every so often to check up on us and refilled our water without being prompted. I highly recommend the Loaded Potato Skins. 3 stars for decent good food and awesome service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2?start=20,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002

All i have to say is on a Saturday around 11 o clock I went in with my cousin to have a early lunch. We sat down ordered our drinks and it took about 10 mins just to get them from the waitress. After getting our drinks, it took her another 15 mins to come back to take our order for our entrees. After that... We didn't get our food for another 45 minutes. But while waiting... I got the manager and explained it was taking forever for everything... Even though they were not busy at all... All the manager offered us was a small basket of fries... Wow.

47,Jazzmine W.,"Waukegan, IL",161,24,19.0,1.0,2014-08-06,"I work in the area and decided to come in for lunch. I was by myself so the hostess asked if I wanted a seat in the bar I took her up on her offer. I get there and the waitress is casually speaking with the table in front of me. I believe she may have known them. She finally walks over and takes my drink order. (Water with lemon) she returns with my drink and there is a huge piece of shredded cheese sitting on top of my lemon. Had she been paying attention she definitely would have saw that prior to bringing it over. She walks away, I flag her down showing her the cheese, asking for a new water and she says omg let get that fixed for you. Returns maybe 15 seconds later, no cheese, flipped over lemon (picked it off) and as I begin to drink from my cup I notice something green on the inside of the glass. I messed with it using my straw it began to flick off the side of my cup into my water. (Totally grossed out) I call her back over and show the dirty glass. She explains to me that it's cilantro from when they wash the dishes and goes to get me another water. Thinking to myself I don't care what it is. It's gross, dirty and disgusting and I don't want it anymore. She brings me a water I didn't even bother drinking. I was grossed out. Brings my food, grilled chicken and corn on the cob. The sandwich tasted a little funny. Idk if they changed the bread but something was different, the corn came with no butter barely any flavor. I was very disappointed and won't be returning to this location. Ever. One star because the waitress was polite but didn't make things right as far as the hazardous mistakes that were made.

The food was great, my only complaint food wise was that my fajita's came with hardly any peppers, it did however, come with a whole onion. Besides that everything tasted delicious. The service was up to par I guess, wasn't the best service I've had at a Chili's but I would come back. Oh and I was left uneasy that the server walked away with my driver's license after being carded, bitch I'm 23 I don't need a fake ID.

I researched this one and saw really bad reviews, but thought that maybe you can't always trust other people's thoughts, I wish I had. My order was messed up from the drink to the meat on the fajitas, which I can deal with. I asked for corn tortillas though because of a gluten allergy and was brought flour and it took awhile to get the waitress back to fix this problem to the point of cold food which is just annoying.  My boyfriend however was brought out a steak with a giant hair on it and at that point we were done. The service was awful and nothing we ordered was right. He was comped his meal though which was the only redeeming thing about this particular Chili's. I will take my business elsewhere from now on. TRUST other people's reviews at this place though!

She seemed unhappy to be at work, no manors or smile. Also did not say bye to us or thank us for our service. I'm sorry but that's just the basics of food service. We weren't complicated at all.

The waiter looked at me like I was crazy, and he said ""why don't you just order a salad with caesar dressing and avocado?"" I looked at him and said ""is that not what I just ordered?""

19,Ian T.,"DeKalb, IL",0,6,5.0,1.0,2017-01-09,"I stopped in for dinner this past weekend. As my entree, I ordered the steak fajitas. I'm not someone who ever sends my food back in a restaurant...even if I don't like, I'll usually just grin & bear. After trying to consume what they presented me, I actually had to send my food back. The guacamole was brown-ish, 1/2 of each of the flour tortillas were hard as a rock, the shredded cheese was hard, and what they called ""steak"" were cubes of meat cooked way past well done & so full of cartilage that I couldn't even bite thru them. Not sure how that could be served to customers. Management needs to take a much closer look at quality control/what is being served as this is completely unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

Came by to take r order and saw my empty cup and didn't touch it, brought r appetizer and still didn't touch it, she finally refilled mine after she brought a refill for my gf. Didn't bring out r meals, never asked us how everything was and had to be told twice by a different server to fill r empty cups because she basically ignored us. The servers name is Jennifer. P.S.

15,Clara C.,"Gurnee, IL",72,33,2.0,4.0,2017-02-04,We waited a while for a table but it was Friday night so that was expected. We ended up being seated in the Lounge at a table that had been empty since we arrived over twenty minutes before. No big deal though...I understand sometimes servers need a chance to catch up! The waitress was relatively friendly and efficient. The drinks and food were exactly what I had been hoping for! Overall it was a very good experience!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
14,A... M.,"Gurnee, IL",0,43,74.0,1.0,2017-03-03,This place needs a big time change in there staff.I personally went in there on Saturday night for carry out and order a veggie burger with cheesecake.Server who took my order never told me that they are out of sirup for cheesecake until it came in box at the end.And I told her precisely that no meat and surprise bacon all over the burger.And made a trip back to give them that back and looks like no one care much..floors were dirty and sticky inside with outdated decor.Manger helped me out with new burger and gave me some coupons to come Back but I think it's more,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
7,Joe D.,"Chicago, IL",65,44,11.0,4.0,2017-03-19,"We had a very tasty meal. The smothered chicken tenders are very cheesy and delicious- not exactly healthy though. The sunrise burger was a tad salty but very good combo with bacon, cheese and a fried egg.

3,Angela D.,"Chicago, IL",106,103,110.0,4.0,2017-03-20,"We came here for lunch right before the Sunday lunch rush, and the server recommended the smothered chicken tenders appetizer. It was HUGE! All the servers were very attentive and frindly to their tables, and the manager came by to check on people too. We had a great server, Jennifer, who mentioned that they have a ""buddy system"" that helps them back each other up while not getting double or triple-sat at once. Their system seems to work really well as we watched it get busy but the servers stayed efficient.  They also said a new menu is coming out soon, along with a watermelon margarita for summer. We'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
9,Joy B.,"Wadsworth, IL",0,19,,3.0,2017-03-23,Hostess had her back to us as we walked to the door - I could see through the glass doors that she turned her head and saw us coming - but she kept her back turned until we were at the hostess stand when she finally turned around and greeted us.  I Asked if we could have a specific booth that was empty- she said no. Not sure what her reasoning was so I left it alone.  Never asked if we needed highchair or booster seat.  Took us to a table with crumbs all over it and walked away.  I walked back to the hostess stand and asked if someone could wipe our table because it was dirty- she said yes- but no one ever came.  Besides that our server was very nice - our food was also good.  It seems like employees could use a little extra training.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
5,Jason B.,"Round Lake, IL",0,24,4.0,2.0,2017-05-10,"We spent about $60 here around 3:00 PM this afternoon and it wasn't worth it at all. First, the food took an extremely long time to come out. We were there for 45 minutes before we even saw our appetizers. The loaded boneless chicken wings didn't have any queso on them and were overcooked. We brought it to the attention of the waitress and she told us the queso was underneath the wings, We told her there was none under there, but she insisted, to the point of being rude, it had to be under there.  My wife ordered the buffalo chicken salad, there were no blue cheese crumbles on it and I ordered a burger that was bland, dry and overcooked. The fried pickles we ordered were mostly chunks of breading in the bag with a few pickles scattered throughout. The only decent item was the fries. Finally, our waitress was never around. I have no idea where she was, but she didn't even offer us refills on our drinks. The place wasn't empty, but by no means was it busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
10,Chuck D.,"Libertyville, IL",0,2,,2.0,2017-08-18,"This restaurant is pretty below average. The seating areas are satisfactory clean, but nothing over the top. The bathrooms were disgusting. Two of the latches in the women's bathroom stalls didn't work, and the other stalls were a complete mess, not to mention the soap and towel dispensers are broken.  I over hear servers talking impolitely about a few of their tables and that they deserve 100% tips. Yikes.  Food is okay. Just average. Service was very very slow, although our server was VERY nice. We did appreciate that, at least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
6,Buddy D.,"Gurnee, IL",0,24,22.0,1.0,2017-10-09,"Bad Chili's!!! Buyer beware! (Go to the one in Waukegan, by the bowling alley) The food is standard, but the service is deplorable. I dropped off a group of 11 teens, all dressed up for Homecoming. They had a reservation and had evidence of it, and the hostess turned them away! It was 5:30 PM! It was not crowded, and the manager could have easily pushed two tables together! I picked up the kids and drove them to Buffalo Wild Wings, who welcomed them!

17,Donna C.,"Antioch, IL",0,6,,2.0,2017-10-16,"This particular Chillis used to be a favorite of ours, whenever we were in Gurnee it was our go to restaurant. Havn't been there in over a year & visited yesterday with a party of six family members. Wow this place went downhill! The place was more than half empty yet we were seated crushed up with the few other guests that were in there. Soft drinks, chips & salsa came out quick but had to wait forever for the one beer that was ordered. Entrees took even longer to come out, I asked the server if our food was ready & she came back with food for three of us while the others waited.  Burgers came out without fries, apparently they weren't quite ready & fajitas were just warm. Had three sets of silverware that were so dirty & still had food crusted on. Floor was dirty from previous guests. The only reason for 2 stars is that the manager compted some of the food, otherwise this would be a 1 star review",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
4,Tashea S.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-28,"This was my first (and probably the last) visit to this restaurant and it was a horrible experience. Firstly, the drinks are ridiculously expensive for what you get. Their pictures are pure false advertisement, my 'margarita' was just a glass of ice with a piece of fruit. Even though the wait was reasonable the food itself was deplorable. The ribs were so dry I had to ask for more bbq sauce to avoid choking . The fries were cold and not well done at all. The only meal that looked palatable were their enchiladas. The burgers were still pink in the middle when served. I wouldn't even serve this food to my dog.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
1,Christina K.,"Round Lake, IL",88,79,44.0,1.0,2017-11-11,"I usually stay clear of chain restaurants like ""Chili's, Applebee's, etc"". But we wanted a burger and were in the area. I had just gotten out of a LONG day of work. My boyfriend and I are very easy going people. Always super polite, tip well, and are patient/understanding. We should have known better...  About 10 minutes after being seated (we were already served drinks by another gentlemen) our server arrived. She immediately seemed rude. Just her tone of voice and facial expressions. She asked if we were ready to order. And we said no. But put in our appetizer. When she came back to take our orders I told her I would like a burger cooked  medium well. She immediately interrupted and said (pink or no pink?!) I said ""medium well please"". She again (pink or no pink!? We don't do medium well. Do you want pink or not). I said okay then, pink.  When my burger arrived I but it in half. It was literally raw. Medium rare to be exact. The out side was cooked but the inside was raw ground beef. This wasn't ""pink"" this was raw. So I told a gentlemen if they could cook it more. He took it with no hesitation and said right away. On his way back to the kitchen he spoke with our server which I overheard her say ""SHE ORDERED IT PINK! I'll bring it back to her"". So she comes back with the food I sent back and says ""YOU WANTED THIS PINK. This is pink."" I explained to her that it was raw. And she said ""IF YOU WANT IT PINK THAN THIS IS WHAT IT WILL BE!!"" I said fine, make it well done then. And she stormed off...  You see. I'm fine with kit hen mix ups. I don't mind waiting for food again. Because well, things happen. And I want to pay for something that I actually want. But this lady was very rude. She spoke to me like I was stupid. Her name was Carie. And I wasn't the only table that she was being like this to. The food was Shit. And the service from Carrie was shit. I will never spend my money here again. I will also be sure to tell ever single military official I Work with how they treat people there. (P.s everyone else that stopped by our table was nice. Carrie sucked tho)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
0,Marvin M.,"Milwaukee, WI",33,175,66.0,3.0,2017-12-19,Food is fine. The staff working here apparently don't care about their workplace. I saw a pre-wrapped silverware package on the floor and the guy who seats people walked past it twice and never picked it up. He looked at it both times but apparently considered it someone else's job. That says a lot about the place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gurnee-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
