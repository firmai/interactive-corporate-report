73,Gregory H.,"Durham, NC",88,1021,87.0,3.0,2012-01-07,"It had been a couple years since we visited this particular location and there's a reason for that.  Friday nights are busy and there's a wait to be seated - not a big deal because it's not a long wait.  Our server was Matt - and he was great about keeping our drinks refilled, and my daughter almost always gets a refill on her Mac n Cheese - and that's what Matt seemed to avoid.  In fact, it never happened and he didn't even give her an opportunity to pose the question, though she tried a couple times and he ignored her.  Granted the place was busy, there wasn't an empty table in the place and you could see he was a little stressed by how busy the place was. The food itself here tasted a little off.  Typically I would LOVE clam strips - not this time - they tasted okay but they also tasted like the oil in the fryer needed to be changed.  I think the service and food are better across to Wake Forest way off of Capital Blvd. Noise level here, as with any Red Robin, is LOUD - you can't hear yourself think!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=80,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005

119,Mal O.,"Cary, NC",0,21,,1.0,2012-03-28,"I hate this entire chain.  It is always noisy, always overcrowded, and more often than not both the food and the service suck. The last THREE times I have been there, I have had to send my entree back: one chicken sandwich doused in so much pesto that the bun was mush, one burger charred so black I actually had to clean soot off of my teeth, and a salad that was about 60% brown, wilted lettuce.  I have friends that like this place for some reason-- they're into the bottomless fries, though the service is always so slow that nobody ever actually gets seconds. Beverages refills are a constant headache, and in my experience are NEVER filled unless you've completely emptied your glass and have asked the server for refills twice.

We started out with ""3 for all"" appertizer, which has fries, sweet potato & onion ring.  It was good with all different type of dipping.  We ordered veggie burger, prime rib dip, 2 cheeseburgers, & seafood scatter.  The burgers were just average, none of us could finish our burgers.  My seafood plate had shrimps, fish fried & clam strips.  The clam was good, but fish was too oil, shrimp was just ok. Staffs were very friendly & quick. It's a pricey place for the average foods thou.  The pime rib burger was more than $13, and the burger was more than $9 each.  Our bill was $90 for foods & coke !!!!

I provided my contact information promptly. 6 MONTHS have passed since I wrote this review and never received a call. Went from bad to worse.  Red Robin used to be a place I would go as a young teen for a decent burger and some milkshakes. Walking in with my father the other day, I was horrified at what I was looking at. An overstaffed kitchen and understaffed floor mixed with a hostess who was texting and not once looked at us until I had to talk to her first started what was soon to be one of the worst dining experiences of my life. My dad and I were seated in the back of the restaurants in a group of about 4 occupied tables. A large party had been there previously and the long table was covered with glasses, dishes napkins and garbage, as were three other surrounding tables. The entire time we were there, one of them got cleaned. ONE. Managers walked by it and didn't give it a second glance. After painfully ordering food from the most anti-social waitress in history, we received our food that was lackluster of any flavor other than what I assume cardboard wrapped in bacon tastes like. I was asked if I wanted another lemonade once the entire hour and when I got my refill, it was a diet coke....... After this entire experience, the waitress had the ovaries to ask me to fill out a customer satisfaction survey located in my ticket wallet which I did her the favor of not filling out.

87,Scott A.,"Raleigh, NC",3,11,,2.0,2014-09-06,"A substandard burger with service to match.  Several years ago I really loved this place - I swear they had one of the best burgers out there. I probably would have given it 4 stars, but so much has changed.    This evening we went to give them another try, the burgers were not great, and even the other items we ordered off the menu just felt like cheap bar food.  Once seated we managed to get an appetizer ordered (some pretzel bits that were good), and then the server disappeared to the abyss.  Finally after the drinks and the appetizer were distant memories,  we decided to go find a manger who in all sincerity did not seem to know what to do.  Our server arrived (by luck) about 3 mins later and we finally got our order placed.   I appreciate their desire for a modern feel - Something about the design of the restaurant tuns it into an echo chamber.  If there are 50 people in the dining room it sounds like there are 100.  Not entirely surprising as its an open ceiling, hard floors, etc.  The sound simply has nowhere to go.  If you like a loud atmosphere its great, but we've found it difficult to carry a conversation in there.  The food was less than impressive.  At our table I feel like we got a good sampling of the menu - A salad, some wings, burgers, etc. Don't get me wrong, its not all bad.  The good news is the steak fires are bottomless which is great because if you decide you just don't want to finish your entree you can fill up on fries (perhaps that is their design).  We did not get to partake in the bottomless fries as our server was pretty much no where to be found.  I'm not saying the food was not edible, but there are just so many other far superior options for the same price or less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=60,2.96,2.96,2.96,1.9280000000000002,2.96

70,Alan K.,"Cary, NC",1,17,,2.0,2014-10-26,"I've been to other RR restaurants that were fairly good.  This one, sadly, was not.  The general look of the place was dull and in need of a good pick-me-up.  There was a general sense of disorganization.  While our server did get our orders correct, she never checked in to see if we needed anything other than what we had. The food was, at best, flavorless.  The burger was cooked beyond well, even though I asked for a medium cook. I suspect a medium cook is not possible as the burgers appeared to be pre-made, packaged, and likely frozen.  The burger lacked even a modicum of flavor. The fries were very ho-hum, lacking anything even approximating crispness. Apparently endless fries means one small serving as that is all I was offered. For less dollars, I could have - and should have - gone to a local burger house and had a good meal.

We asked for a booth and they sat us in the bar.  It was several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. We got our food but the extras we asked for didn't come so we had to wait. We had to wait for silverware and napkins. She refilled Hubby's Dr pepper with root beer. We waited ten more minutes before a different waitress asked if everything was okay. We told her the problem and waited another five minutes for our waitress to bring another soda. And she didn't apologize! I had a burger with bottomless fries and after I was done and put my napkin and knife on my empty plate she asks if I want more fries.  Here's the kicker.

58,Jeff L.,"Raleigh, NC",1,39,29.0,1.0,2014-12-01,"Went here last night.  Party of 12.  Celebrating 2 birthdays and a new baby announcement. Service was underwhelming. Taking the drink order was late, taking the food order was late, food arrival was late and 3 of 12 orders were wrong.  Drinks were always dry.  At one point I got up and walked to the bar to get a refill on my soda. I wouldn't specifically say the waitress was bad.  But I did comment to her that it was obvious the lousy way the short order line was managed as well as the un-hurried attempts at putting the food up. She did comment ""you have no idea"". The manager made no appologies and was busy at several other tables trying to implement damage control. Several tables around us were very obviously experiencing the same low level of service. It must be a routine issue there, as the management speech I got sounded very rehersed.  We did get comp'd 3 desserts that we didn't order and 1 meal that I finally got after everyone else was done eating. After spending over $90 and the rest of our party well over $120.00 and no real releif, I realized this place has taken a sharp down turn in thier approach to service.  Just looking at the other local area RR reviews, doesn't instill confidence that it's ""just this location"". All I can advise is, service is a reflection of management.  McDonalds has better service for far less.  Food quality is mutual.  Although RR has a unique spin on the burger experience, the lack of service doesn't equate to good value.  I've written off AppleBee's and Johnny Carrino's in this area.  I don't think my expectations are too high.  I simply think the approach to service has plumetted so low, the management staff is undertrained and the experience just winds up being a blunder.  If you go on the spur of the moment and happen to wind up here on Yelp for a sanity check... your experience may differ.  But I doubt it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=40,2.52,2.52,2.52,1.7960000000000003,2.52

56,Matt C.,"Raleigh, NC",4,105,,1.0,2014-12-09,"Let me start with the positives about my experience: We were greeted and seated quickly, probably because the place was 3/4 empty. .....that's it for the positives. Now for the negatives:  Reader's Digest version: Absolutely pathetic, underwhelming, insufficient, unsatisfactory, and inadequate in every phase of service and dining.  Long version : Despite being almost empty the server took 10 minutes to get to the table and get our order. Then brought out the drinks 10 minutes later with the appetizer (wings) we ordered.  (Hint- don't get the wings you'll be really disappointed if you like wings. It looks like they got the leftovers some the small, weak, anorexic chickens) I had to get up and go to a servers station and get napkins myself, because guess what?- the server didn't bring any and disappeared, again. Who doesn't give out napkins for wings? Maybe a cost savings thing. Silverware didn't make it the table the whole night, maybe the dishwasher was on strike or they figured another way to save money by not having any.   Then the entrees come out about 20 minutes later. Meanwhile, drinks have been sitting empty for a while. Manager comes by and asks if everything is ok as food comes out and keeps on walking, never saw him again. I would keep on walking as well if I was in charge of this gastro-fiasco. The burgers are a sad pathetic embarrassment for ""gourmet"", unless gourmet means ""overpriced, small piece of cheap tasteless meat with some toppings on it"".  There were probably 10 fries in the basket of fries, but they were in a fancy aluminum cylinder thing. Maybe the artistic fry holder is where the money for napkins and silverware went. Look at the pictures THEY have posted on Yelp. Count the number of fries- it is less than 12 in all the photos.  The edges of the bread was hard, like it was old. A couple of the 10 fries were not fully cooked. I liked Red Robin much better a few years ago when the menu was like Waffle House, a laminated double sided piece of paper and reasonably good burgers. The ""gourmet burgers"" business model is an EPIC FAIL. Management needs to re-think that concept, starting at this location. Despite her disappearing act most of the night, the server did promptly bring out the bill.  I could go on, but why waste my time and yours? The single star says it all. Bottom line is: go to Wendy's. Get a double. It will be cheaper and more of a ""gourmet"" burger than this was, you get your own napkins, eating utensils, and refill your own drinks and their service couldn't be any worse!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=40,2.32,2.32,2.32,1.7960000000000003,2.32

53,Ryan B.,"Durham, NC",302,144,36.0,2.0,2015-04-27,The service here is the pits... The food is typical of all other red robins and have the best fries around. The bacon burger is delicious and big enough to share. All the lemonades are bottomless (as they should be for $4.50 each). He fries/sides are also bottomless which makes sharing even better.

Water was refilled fast, and the manager was out on the floor and asking how our meal was. My husband and I felt almost spoiled- maybe we are used to bad service?

43,DJ M.,"Raleigh, NC",17,48,22.0,1.0,2015-07-10,"Thank you to Red Robin for allowing me to pay for my last $10 burger. I will not being doing so any longer - especially at this location. Preface: I love Red Robin's burgers (especially the Royal Red) and I have been to this location in the past. However, after this last visit I felt the need to share my experiences. My party arrived on a slow Monday night at 7pm. Seated right away. Drinks came fast (except for a root beer float) - then absolutely nothing.....crickets.....chirp chirp. Took 45 minutes to get our food - just a few burgers nothing special. Food temp was questionable. Drink refills were nonexistent. Service was the same.  Red Robin no longer serves their messy burgers wrapped up in baskets. Instead they place them unwrapped on fancy plates because they want to compete outside of their specialty with other nicer restaurants. That makes eating such burgers even more complicated and not what I am looking for when I want a greasy burger. Their fries portions are the same size as one would find in a Happy Meal. Forget ordering another round as that will be another half hour wait time - as if they should not expect customers to ask for more of the ""bottomless"" fries. Not worth the average cost of $15 person. Love the Royal Red but I can add an egg to my burger at home. For eating out, I will stick to the Dollar Menu, Cookout, or Five Guys if I want to splurge a bit. At least I know what I will get from each of these, like them all, and will save some coin along the way.  Miss the old Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.604,2.12

Waitress was clearly deaf, she did not care that my drink was empty the 30 times she passed my table, and completely ignored my pleas for more beverage. Just when I was going to get up and go get my own drink she stops and asks would you like another drink.Then it took just as long to get it back to the table. My Wife ordered a mixed drink, one of there supposed signature beverages from the bar. When she got it, it was undrinkable. I mean it tasted horrible. There's no way they would make a drink like that on purpose. We got someone to bring out some pineapple juice to dilute it with and make it less bitter.  She was a trooper and sipped on it. Only because no one cared enough to check back... she had no choice. The food was OK Took forever to get anything. The other thing that pissed me off was that she just came and dropped the plates on the table and said enjoy! She never came back to make sure the food was as expected or even edible for that matter. We asked for fries refill, it never came, we managed to get desert, it was ok as well. The bottomless fries came when we were done with desert...thanks.  Most painful dinning experience ever. Very sad I drove past 5 equally bad restaurants in the 35 mile journey to get here. Now I know, Red Robin can kiss my hairy white butt!

Last night we decided to get takeout and we will never go back again.  Let me start by saying the food seemed to be going downhill for awhile but last night was inedible. My husband had some chicken sandwich and had about two bites and threw it out. The only thing I ordered were the steak fries and they forgot those completely. I thought the milkshakes would be ok. I was wrong. The salted caramel tasted like salted milk. Almost got sick after the first sip. Of course my two girls liked their meal but they are 2 and 5.  We don't expect much from Red Robin but we are usually able to eat a meal from there once in awhile. This time I really mean it when I say we will not be going back!

He also asked if we wanted any refills on fries and if we wanted dessert. My only problem was that they didn't have any seafood which put a damper on one of us but the waiter recommended a salad with not only sound good but also when it came to the table it tastes very well so he was the saving grace. I recommend you ask for Angel if you come to the place he will make sure that you are taken very well cared of.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=80,2.08,2.08,2.08,1.9720000000000002,2.08

86,Brooke N.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",6,2,,1.0,2015-08-24,"I am honestly not a picky critic when it comes to servers or bartenders for I am in the service industry myself. I know that sometimes things happen that the server or bartender can not control. There are also just miserable people out there that are impossible to please.  Tonight was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.  We arrived at 6:45 and stood at the door for about ten minutes before we were greeted by a hostesses. The only reason I knew what time we arrived is because we stood there for so long we checked our phones to see if it was the busy dinner rush and maybe that's why there was no one to greet us. My boyfriend and I were then told it would be a ten minute wait. After waiting 25 minutes our name was finally called.  Upon sitting down we were promptly greeted by our blonde server Briana who took our drink order, then shortly after our food order. We never saw her at our table again after that. It took a good thirty minutes for our food to come out which the manager delivered to our table. Briana never came back to check to see if everything came out alright. My sweet potato fries were super cold. Not even luke warm - seemed like they had been sitting out for a good while. Our ketchup bottle was empty on the table and I was in need of some extra BBQ sauce. We were sitting right next to the food line so we could see our server but she just kept walking right past us. It was probably 7 or 8 minutes I waited until I finally just got up myself and walked to the line to request some ketchup, BBQ sauce, and fresh fries. A DIFFERENT server then came over and brought me everything I needed. The service manager (whose name I can't remember) came over to apologize for the cold fries. He then said Briana was busy helping HIM get food out and that is why she was no where to be found. He wasn't very customer friendly, just seemed more like excuses coming from him. He then tried to make small talk with me as managers usually do to try to take my mind off the frustrations.  We made it half way through our meal (mine was delicious but my boyfriends burger was way over cooked) without ever having Briana come back to our table. She would walk right by; we would see her...but she wouldn't come over. We were soon out of tea. We put both of our empty glasses on the edge of the table and at this point we just stared at her in hopes she would come over. Finally my boyfriend flagged her down and asked if we could have more tea. She then brings over one glass of tea and sits it in front of him next to my empty glass and walks away. We both then laughed because the service was just so terrible it was comical. He then gave me his tea and we waited another ten minutes to ask ANOTHER server for one more glass of tea.  Side note, this entire time we were surrounded by her dirty tables. Every single table next to us was dirty and was never cleaned off the entire time we sat there until we walked out.  No apology from Briana, no emotion was ever shown on her face as she brought over our check. We pre-bussed our own table and neatly laid everything over to the edge of the table. She never came over to take the plates away. We gave her our credit card and watched her drag around the food line aimlessly as if she had no sense of urgency. She brought back our receipts in the check presenter and walks away - and OF COURSE no pen!!!! I honestly just grabbed the closest server and begged for a pen because we wanted to get the heck out of there. The service was honestly terrible. Not only did our service suck but she was waiting on a table nearby and we could hear them complaining to her  about different things she was not doing (ie: wrong cheese on their burger, no refills, etc.)  Me and my boyfriend both being bartenders at a local restaurant we were examining the situation and we came to the conclusion that maybe Briana was in training but had no trainer with her. The credit card receipt that we received back had a different servers name on it (Taylor) leaving us under the impression she was training under Taylor's name.  ****Note to Taylor, I wouldn't trust Briana with making your tips for the night because the service was way less than mediocre.***** You should of been overseeing her.  Honestly, my boyfriend and I agreed to never go back. Which is sad because the food was good enough to go back but the service was just ridiculous.  We did leave a good tip :) we both agreed that it was pretty much impossible to leave a bad tip considering we both work the same job as her and bad tips are the pits. She DESERVED no tip - if I'm being honest. She did absolutely nothing for us but provide a few laughs in regards to the train wreck service she was providing.

On each table, they had a touch screen tablet where you can order your food. However, when you first order, you can only use the tablet for appetizers and put in your main course and drinks with your waiter/waitress. If we wanted something from our waitress, then you press the button on the screen and a red light will begin flashing. Our waitress was pretty fast so I was pleased with their service. For food, I ordered short stack order of their famous onion tower because I love onion rings. I made sure to get them extra crispy. Then I got the whiskey river bbq burger with their endless steak fries. I didn't take advantage of the endless fries since I was full with my appetizer, but I thought it was a good deal.

94,Jon O.,"Raleigh, NC",67,549,210.0,3.0,2015-11-04,"Had my first Red Robin experience the other night. Being my first visit I would call It a momentous occasion....Anyways, we sat in the bar area at a High Top and the waitress came by to go over the menu and introduce us to ""robin"" who was the on-table touchpad device similar to a kindle that allows you to order everything except your main course and even pay for your tab. It's kind of a neat idea since a lot of the drudgery of ordering is easy as pushing buttons on a screen and this simplifies the process. The we ordered a couple apps (chips and dip, onion rings) and they were pretty good. I had a burger for my meal and it was pretty good too. The food overall was....pretty good, but not amazing. The price point for this place seems to be just around 12$ for a burger which is a little steep but you do get bottomless fries with that which is a plus. The only problem I had with this location is that the table and about everything in the area we sat at was kinda sticky like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a while. Maybe it was also the decor setting the mood but the feel was just sort of grimy all over imo.

107,Tracie M.,"Durham, NC",0,1,,1.0,2015-11-17,"So....this has to be the worst red robin experience yet (there have been a few)! Where do I start? First let me say that we both work in the industry so we are overly aware of what is going on when we go out to eat!  First we walked in at 4:10 we waited 5 min to be seated, while there were what appeared to be two managers sitting at the very first table. A server with hands full of plates greeted us and told us she would be right back. She went to the managers at the front table and asked for some help. The manager said she had seen us but thought we had already been helped. We went to the back and as she lead us to the table there was ketchup all over the floor so we reversed to a table we had just passed.  We sat down and waited another 5 min to be greeted by our server. My daughter ordered a Sprite and we ordered a bottled beer and a tall draft. After quite a few min she returned to our table saying she only wanted to bring it all at the same time. She placed the bottle down on the table and then dropped the rest of the drinks on my six year old daughter. Broke the glass in to pieces that landed all in my lap. She looked stunned and didn't get any napkins. I took my daughter to the bathroom to dry off and when I returned he was still waiting for her to come back and clean up. She asked if we wanted to stay at the same table, we moved ourselves. We knew what we wanted because I was looking in the car cause we were on a time restriction. She came back and said she didn't know where the bartender was to replace the beer she had spilt. We gave her our order and then kept on waiting. We wanted to play games because we had already paid at the first table. You can only play once they activated your table. So we know she hadn't put in our food or transferred out table number yet.  Appetizers came out. Small onion tower and clam chowder. Dropped and ran. When she finally came back he pointed out that the soup was to come with bread...she blamed it on the kitchen and then brought the bread 15 min later after he was done with the soup. The manager came to apologize and said he would take care of the beer and the onion rings (but not the soup that was missing the bread). Later he returned with our food. We had ordered a few sauces to try out with our meal. They didn't come out so we let her know and again she blamed it on the kitchen. Brought our sauces out and ran again.  I ordered another beer because my nerves were shot at this point. I would have just drank water, but that requires ever being brought the water. My boyfriend was facing the bar and said it had been sitting there forever. The bar tender brought the beer and didn't ask if she should get another for him since it was completely empty. Server came back to see if everything was ok. But he had to step out he was so frustrated. I asked for the check and a box. About 5 min later she returned to the table with the check but no box. So I asked again. She came back and sorta plopped it on the table. We paid and got out as soon as we could because I had to get home to change my daughter into something that didn't smell like beer to get where we needed to be at 6! No one seemed to be happy to be there. Service was horrible. Food wasn't bad at all so thumbs up to the kitchen. Red robin needs to think of retraining the entire staff. Everyone has bad days or drops something.

52,Pens M.,"Raleigh, NC",31,3,,1.0,2016-04-09,"After several unsavory experiences with the Wake Forest location, we decided to travel out of our way to go to this Brier Creek location instead.  We've been going to these Red Robin locations for several years.  From now on, however, we will not be going to Red Robin ever again.  At both locations, we've experienced less than impressive results. Our final encounter with Red Robin (Sat, 2016 April 2--at this location in Brier Creek) was horrendous:  The waiter was nice but consistently incompetent:  He lost our Rewards card and after leaving us hanging with avoidance tactics, we had to call him over and ask what he was doing about our lost card.  He mumbled something about getting an answer from the manager, disappeared, and eventually the manager showed up with requests for us to look through our belongings.  We had already done so--to a ridiculous extent, as the waiter knew, having gone through that routine with us already.   I informed both the waiter and the manager that after we gave the waiter our rewards card, he went away and came back only with the receipt listing our rewards status.  No card.  He needed to go look for the card.  He disappeared.  We later flagged him down, asking about it, and he mumbled about not being able to find it. Oh, it gets better.  Neither the waiter nor manager made any effort to make our experience any better--other than telling us there was a number we could call.  Even then, we had to tell the manager to actually go ahead and write that number down for us.  It might have been helpful for the manager, instead, to do *anything* proactive--anything from proactively bringing the number to us...to calling the number for us...to discounting the cost of the meal...especially given the consistently incompetent service.   The first sign of trouble was minor enough, and I didn't mind, but most places have a fit when the patron does the waiter's job for him:  I went to the bar to pick up my beer.  It was clear the waiter would not get around to it any time soon, and I was in no mood for waiting patiently to be served a beer gone flat. But wait, there's more:  The waiter demonstrated a complete lack of ability to comprehend my companion's order for a vanilla malt with double the malt.  Someone else came to the table to ask us what we really wanted, beginning with a request for confirmation that we wanted two vanilla malts, which we did not.  She understood the corrected request without difficulty and filled the order quickly.  Long story short, the original waiter failed point after point after point to deliver what we requested, let alone in a timely fashion.  My companion was fit to be tied over losing the card, and the waiter turned into a ghost. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life, and I've had a lifetime of experiences with which to make this comparison.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-raleigh?start=40,1.84,1.84,1.84,1.6360000000000001,1.8400000000000003

The noise level was typical....loud.  The fries were not as good as usual. They were less tasteful even with quite a bit of the seasoned salt on them. The Whiskey BBQ seemed to have too much lettuce and not much chicken. The Turkey Burger was good.  I'd still recommend them when the fries are better. The food is usually pretty good.

The kitchen often sounds like a brawl is going to break out amongst the staff. Servers here seem unenthusiastic and unresponsive. Tonight, our waitress took our order, then she brought us our drinks. We didn't see her again until we got up to ask for service. We needed drink refills, fry refills, silverware and napkins. I got up to inquire, and a manager got those things addressed. At the end of the meal, the manager didn't offer any assistance. It was time for both my friend and I to receive our 10th burger free. My receipt showed a free burger, but my buddy's didn't. The manager took care of his burger, (and let him keep his free one). When I inquired, he didn't offer the same to me.  I love Red Robin, but this location has very bad management.

82,Joanna S.,"Morrisville, NC",0,4,,1.0,2017-05-13,Visited this location tonight with my children. We were seated in the bar area. Our waitress was the bartender. After our order was taken my son's salad came out first. We had no silverware so I asked the person who brought the food for a set. 10 mins later nothing. Finally I had to go to the bar to ask the bartender for a fork. It took so long because they were all in the dishwasher!?!?!! We then got our food my son having ordered a burger in a basket. When helping him get settled I noticed there was a French fry with ketchup in the basket under his food. The manager did come over and of course confirm how gross this was and thanked me for bringing it to his attention. I was disappointed by the lack of attention from the server. I understand that she may have been busy making drinks so I blame the management expecting a bartender to appropriately attend to guests. I was also surprised to see my son's meal wasn't removed from our bill. Disappointed in both the service and cleanliness of this location.

I'd rather you take back the good and I'll spend my $12 on a pizza that would st least full me up! I will NEVER dine with you again and I'll be sure to spread the word on how you treat your paying customers.

He said it was a little extra protein and said we could have the burger for free. When the bill came, the previously free burger was now $6.99 and the gourmet burger was free.

After our party of six was seated, no one came to take our drink orders for about 15 minutes. By that time, we were ready to order. Food took an additional 30 minutes to reach the table, and the waiter serving the food forgot which one of the identical burgers that me and my friend ordered was cooked medium and which was cooked medium-rare, so he just guessed. The waitress who initially took our orders was barely present throughout the experience. Theoretically, fries are bottomless at Red Robin, but service was so slow that we only received one refill. Our waters we also only refilled once throughout the meal. Overall, the flavor of the food really wasn't bad, but the lackluster service took away from the experience.

Here's why...service is okay, not overly friendly, especially for the price of their food. I get it, a little, as a former server of a burger joint. The cup of soup that cost $5 and was extremely small and took (13 literal bites) is hardly what I would expect to pay. The size of the cup was laughable and a bit appalling. Burgers are always good, but the ""all you can eat fries"" is not enough to keep me going here. I'm sitting at the bar and a carryout order came in to place an order and waited ten minutes and still no one came, so she decided to go elsewhere. The bartender did tell her that someone would be there to take the order, but no one came. It's a bit of a shame and I can't say I will be back. I feel for $11 a burger, I can go someplace happier, with better and fast service than this place. I've currently waited over thirty minutes for a burger .

We were seated and waited a few minutes until a waiter showed up.  The restaurant was definitely understaffed, waited a while for the app and food. We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer but turned out the ran out. We ate, got our check and realized bill was as wrong. The beer was listed as 3.50 and we were charged 6.50.

21,Kelly F.,"Raleigh, NC",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-14,"This is my first time writing a yelp review, but my experience at Red Robin made me feel as if I needed to. We walked in and were seated fairly quickly, but no one had come to greet us or get our drink order for about 10 to 15 minutes. We brushed it off when the waiter finally came over because he apologized and thanked us for our patience. We immediately asked for a drink and bottomless fries. He went to put that order in and came back to take our dinner order. About 25 to 30 minutes pass by and we still had not received our fries. We politely asked the waiter if we could get those fries and he said that the kitchen was running behind. He came back a few minutes later with the smallest plate with maybe 7 fries on it. Our food came out shortly after which was mediocre, if even.  The first thing we noticed when we walked in to Red Robin was the dessert trio that was advertised all over, which consisted of an oreo sundae, chocolate covered brownie sticks, and donuts. We never order dessert, but it looked so good that we had to get it. Another 15 to 20 minutes pass by before we actually got our dessert. A lady brought it out and it had the tiniest donuts, the brownie sticks, and a bowl of crushed up oreos. I told the lady that we were supposed to have the trio with the ice cream sundae, so she took it back. She came back out with the exact same bowl of crushed up oreos, but with soft serve ice cream sloppily poured on top. Still no toppings on it. Literally just ice cream and crushed oreos, no hot fudge, whip cream or cherry. It looked absolutely NOTHING like the picture. McDonald's provides a much better sundae and it looks 100 times better than what we were given. We asked to speak to the manager, who didn't seem very sympathetic, but took the dessert off of our tab. We told him we didn't want the dessert and just wanted the check. I normally don't get offended easily, but the experience was degrading in the way they served the food like we wouldn't notice.
