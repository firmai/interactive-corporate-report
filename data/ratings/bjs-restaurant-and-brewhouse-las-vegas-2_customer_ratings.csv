Unlimited Soup & Salad $6.95 Your choice of soup and a house or Caesar salad (unlimited refills).

335,Janel S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",370,309,435.0,4.0,2012-01-28,"Service here was fantastic. Destiny was such an amazing server. She was so bubbly, cheery, and very attentive. She sure knows her brewskies! She helped me find a good brew of choice, and she also made light conversations with us. Such a sweet waitress. Also, I left forgetting my keys on the table and the nice busser flagged me down and gave me my keys back. Thank you sir! The food is a-ok. I think for a lunch special that is $5.95, I really can't complain. I had the chicken quesadilla and my friend had the bottomless soup and salad. the good part about that is you can switch off your soups and salads if you want to try something different. I honestly come for the pazookie. They have the best pazookies, and they bake the cookie the way I lllloooovvveee my cookie! Soft and doughy. My ultimate favorite is the macadamia nut pazookie. I'm really tempted to try the red velvet, but my heart just can't let go of the macadamia nut. I guess I'm just not ready to let go yet...(It's complicated). I also had the Nutty Brewnette which had the very carmelly sweet and nutty. I also must warn you that this brew sure's got some HOP to it. After one drink I was getting quiet and I'm never quiet.  If you are all about a strong roundhouse kick in your brew...try the Piranha...I was about to choose this one then Destiny kind of warned me that it's got a really strong spicy taste to it, and it's got a whole lot of hop to it. So, I backed out on that one.

492,Marisol J.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,2,,4.0,2012-03-25,"Bj""s  is one of those restaurants I have a love hate relationship with.  Some of the items, I just love some are not so great in my opinion.  First things first parking can be a hassle at times, and your bound to wait re guard less of what night of the week you attend.  I like the atmosphere and decor very much.  The wait staff is pleasant enough, yet often make mistakes with our orders.  In all fairness we usually have rather large family dinners there. Now, the food.  They have great soups the tortilla soup is my daughters favorite with fresh avocados a top.  My son and I love the Tomato Soup, truly creamy and delicious with large homemade croutons.  I usually start to get full with just my soup.  On most evenings we go my daughter orders their Chicken Alfredo, she normally loves it.....occasionally can be dry.  I ordered a little more sauce was charges an additional 3.50 ouch!  My son usually goes for their Jumbalaya which is very delicious and huge portion, or their ribs both are very tasty.  I waiver between their New york strip, which by the way is great! or at times go for their other pasta dishes on the menu.  I personally am not impressed with their pasta  dishes, find them a bit tasteless.  Also their pork medallions with white cheddar mashed potatoes are great..... I can't ever leave this restaurant with out eating desert.  My kids and I are crazy about their warm fresh baked cookie with ice cream a top called Pazooky, I'm sure I've misspelled that....l.o.l. yet  a sinful and  necessary experience!  Dinner there usually can be a bit pricey with appetizers and desert usually about $90 to $!00  for the three of us.  Bj's is always a family favorite, with variety for all offering a huge menu and great to go service too. Bottom line is, if I ask my kids to pick a restaurant to go to, always seems to be Bj's a leading contender!

327,Pam G.,"Apex, NC",25,287,,3.0,2012-03-26,"We stopped in to BJs for lunch after hiking in the Red Rock canyons. We sat in the bar area and were quickly greeted and had our drink order taken immediately. The service started to go downhill after that. We had a very long wait for our drinks, to the point that we had to flag down the server to see if he had forgotten about them.  He was not polite with his response that he was 'waiting for the bartender to pour them'.  We did finally get our drinks and placed our lunch order.  The first thing to arrive was our friends chicken tortilla soup. They made a nice production of pouring the broth over the soup at the table, presumably so that the tortillas didn't get soggy, but he had no spoon. We couldn't flag anyone down for a spoon, so my DH finally went and asked someone for a spoon. We still sat there for a long time before a spoon arrived. When we finally saw our waiter again,my Dh asked him to bring our friend a new soup (ok, he may have TOLD him to :-)) I think at this point our waiter realized that our service hadn't been great and he brought over a sample of one of their beers which was nice. The funny thing though was that I also got chicken tortilla soup and when they brought it, after all of this, no spoon! Maybe they have a shortage, idk. We knew to ask immediately this time and they did bring it out pretty quickly.  Having said all that, we all really enjoyed our food. The chicken tortilla soup was very good, the mac and cheese was excellent, the chopped salad was great and huge, and they recognized that our service was not good and did try to make up for it. They also made a very tasty margarita, so it's worth another visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=360,4.0,4.05,4.05,3.0200000000000005,4.03

Garnished with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  We also got the crispy fried artichokes.  It was lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Both of these were very good. For an entree, I got a good old bacon burger, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles, smothered with their special sauce.  It was juicy and very good.  I love bacon, so if I would change anything, I would add more bacon! Service this time was very good, I enjoyed the food, my husband was disappointed with his choice of entree, the old fashion pot roast.  He said it was truly ""old"" as in taste, he felt it was the left overs from the night before.   But the menu had some nice looking items, especially deserts that we might have to return for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=200,4.0,4.06,4.06,3.024,4.0360000000000005
207,Clint B.,"Las Vegas, NV",761,1113,4735.0,3.0,2012-04-04,"The number one reason to come here is the pizookie. Sure, it's something that I can easily make at home, but I'm way too lazy. It came out in a fairly large (maybe 5-6 inches in diameter) metal dish. In it, a piping hot, moist and chewy chocolate chip cookie at least a quarter inch thick and topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's simple but when you combine two classics like cookies and ice cream it's a sure fire way to make me drool. It's large enough for three people to share, but my son and I managed to devour it quickly between the two of us. The other food is pretty standard. They've got a big menu that'll make you think you're at the Cheesecake Factory. Full of items not high in quality of preparation or ingredients, but large enough to appease any hearty appetite. The pot roast sandwich may not be good for the heart, but it's good for the soul -- slices of beef on top of toasted garlic bread. If that wasn't enough they top it off with mashed potatoes and gravy. Some random veggies on the side might fool others into believing it's healthier than it is. The wife went with a classic burger. Standard fare, but it hit the spot. The place is great for families. It's loud enough to drown out the sounds of restless toddlers and plenty of tv's to distract you from the average food and service. The kid's menu is full of all the usual stuff -- chicken tenders, grilled cheese, burgers, etc. So, chances are there's something for even the pickiest eater. 3.5 Stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=180,3.96,4.06,4.06,2.9240000000000004,4.0200000000000005
411,Leah S.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,13,3.0,4.0,2012-05-01,"Ive been here numerous times. A good place for consistent food and drinks when shopping or errands on that side of town. This review is for Friday night with a group of 7 at around 7pm. We were expecting a wait (it's Friday at dinner rush) so my husband & I got there early and ordered drinks at the bar after putting our names on the list. The wait was an hour - typical for a popular restaurant on a Friday night. We enjoyed a glass of Pinot and a house lager before the rest of our party joined us. We were so lucky- an 8 top table in the bar area opened up and we swooped it up! I prefer bar dining, anyways. We are a low maintenance group that understands the workings of a busy restaurant. Our server was friendly and efficient for how busy she was. We ordered the avocado rolls, calamari and boneless buffalo wings for apps. Everyone had beer or cocktails and started Cesar salads. Everything was timed right and satisfying. We ordered 3 pizzas (theirs are deep dish). My husband asked for no tomatoes on ours and they made with tomatoes- but they realized the mistake and started making one without while leaving the pizza with so we weren't eating after the rest of our group. The server was apologetic and the manager brought the correct pizza out when it was ready.  They handled the situation correctly and we were happy with the service. For some people this would ruin their dinner... But really- stuff happens, the apologized and fixed it!

446,Eric S.,"Las Vegas, NV",789,425,57.0,4.0,2012-05-12,"BJ's is a fun place to go if you aren't on a diet.  I am not certain there is anything on the menu that is a healthy choice, even items listed as a healthy choice.  BUT, if you go there for the food, you won't be disappointed.  From their Avacodo Egg Rolls to their Chicago-esque pizza, they know how to make their food.  They recently added ""small plates"" to their menu, 8 -10 mini appetizers for between 2-4 dollars each.  We decided to sample as many as we could and ordered Thai won tons, meatballs, a mozzerella salad, and fried artichokes.  The Artichokes were surprisingly good with large pieces of artichoke beneath a breading that didn't zap the flavor of the choke.  The dipping sauce was good but not perfect.  The meatballs failed miserably as they stunk like yesterday's laundry.  They tasted ok but the smell really curdled our appetite.  Luckily the Thai chicken won tons were excellent.  Add to that a wedge salad, housebrewed root beer and cream soda, and a kids meal and the three of us got out for under $40.00 with full tummies!  And the kids Pazooki comes with their meal and is big enough fo the adults to sample without stuffing it in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=480,4.0,4.05,4.05,2.8960000000000004,4.03

389,Bryan B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,2.0,2012-05-22,"***** Service: Our server was great. I wish I could remember his name - he is a young Hispanic kid with a faux-hawk. Seriously, excellent server. **** Kids: The menu is great, with several options for kids. All kids items are $5.99, which includes a main dish, side dish, and a drink.  The only problem I found is that if you have a child who needs a high-chair your wait will be longer because of the lack of tables - their booths are not designed to have a high-chair on the outside. * Food: It is just not very good. My wife got the jalapeno burger and was not impressed, which is saying a lot because she is not very picky when it comes to burgers. I got the Cajun pasta with shrimp and, while the flavor was okay, the pasta was terrible.  At least half of the noodles were stuck together in groups of 2,3,4 and more! Obviously, this makes for some crunchy, impossible-to-eat pasta.  How hard is it to cook fettuccine noodles? It was like someone stuck them in a too-small pot and just left them there for 6-8 minutes and then tossed them on a plate.

I ordered the sampler of beer which was fun. I always love getting the sampler at Yardhouse and was happy to see they had one here as well. As an appetizer I started with the Ahi poke bowl - it was perfectly dressed and the tuna was super fresh. I always order this dish  anywhere it is on the menu and I can say this was the best I have ever had. I had the mini caprese salad next also fantastic - they used a very creamy mozzarella and it was the perfect portion for a midcourse. For my entree I had the buffalo chicken pizza -super thick crust and a nice drizzle of ranch on top. Not only did it look like a work of art but it tasted fantastic too.  Now my husband was not as happy with the meal as I was.Ffirst the waitress convinced him not to order the beer battered shrimp that he wanted and talked him into a pulled pork sandwich which he didn't really enjoy. The biggest issue however was the timing of the food delivery. Or salads were brought out before the appetizers were even half way finished and the entrees came out not even 3 minutes later. We were sitting there with 6 plates of food on the table. W e enjoy going out once a week for a ""date night"" and like to take our time and enjoy our meal.

I liked the atmosphere and size of the restaurant.  The service was pretty bad.  We called while in the parking lot because it looked really busy but the hostess tells us theres no wait for 2 people.  So we walk in and she says it'll be about 5 minutes.  We could clearly see theres several open tables but whatever.  We stand there and 5 minutes later she decides to tell us ""oh, you can just go seat yourself over there""  Ummm okay.  Our server was very nice but I could tell he had more tables then he could handle because after he took our order we didnt see him again for 20 minutes.  We finished our beer and never got asked if we wanted another.  My glass of water remained empty for about 20 minutes.  If he was a bit more attentive I would've enjoyed my experience a lot more.  Medium pizza, 2 side salads, one pint of beer, and the sampler of 4 beers ($6.00) was $40.  All in all, it was nothing special.

402,S K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,4.0,2012-09-09,"I recently moved to the area and while getting unpacked and settled, I grabbed take out from here about twice/week. I tried similiar type restaurants in the area (i..e, Claim Jumper) but have found the quality of food and friendliness of staff much stronger here than other places.  There have a been a few issues - one time, despite waiting to pick up for until the 15-20 minute ready time, my order hadn't been put in yet. Another time, a salad with the dinner didn't make it into my bag (and I didn't realize this until I got home). Both times, however, the staff was super responsive. With the delayed order, the manager comped the meal without a complaint from me. Likewise with the missing salad - I called and asked them to just make a note for the next time I was going to be in (b/c with boxes still unpacked, it was inevitable I'd be in again) but they comped the entire entree. When I went in the other day, they also gave me a complimentary gift card for future orders. I've not eaten in the restaurant, so I can't attest to the service of the waitstaff (as mentioned by several people in previous posts), but the take-out order staff is super friendly, accomodating, and easy to deal with.  The food is pretty good. It's not fancy, gourmet style. It's quality comfort-type food that's much better than bigger chains (i..e, Applebee's, Chili's).  They have the best mashed potatoes in the area. Their salmon is excellent, and the parmasan chicken was really good too. I don't like their fish and chips, but I've not found a local/Summerlin restaurant that does fish and chips well.

I prefer the Peanut Butter Cookie Pazookie over the Chocolate Chip.   My favorite dish is the Great White Pizza.  Chicago deep dish style pizza that taste like a pasta alfredo.  I love it when they burn the crust a little.  Sometimes I request it.  Service is just average, but really good during lunch.  I have to say, service is better than Yard House across the street.   Any BJ's is a safe bet when your with a group and everyone is undecided where to eat.  One things for sure, getting a table is a lot easier here than in the one's I frequent in California.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=220,3.28,3.89,3.89,3.632,3.6460000000000004

I enjoy the texture of the pan pizza, but they no longer serve them in the pan, which was a disappointment. Maybe they were just a little too heavy for the servers to carry, but man they really helped keep the pizza warm and the presentation was better. Now they serve them on a plate and it just wasn't the same. I didn't really enjoy either pizza flavor either. I've had both before and they were ok, but this time I was completely underwhelmed. The pizza just didn't seem warm and gooey enough to make up for the lack of flavor either.  I did enjoy my unsweetened tropical iced tea. I'm always happy when places offer other varieties of unsweetened tea. The service was ok as well. Our server was friendly, but she wasn't very quick with the refills, so we sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I would have liked.

The menu for BJ's is quite extensive and has something for everyone in your group.  Their pizzas are fabulous and come in so many different varieties or you can design your own.  My fave would be the White Pizza.  Anything with Alfredo sauce and I am in love.  My husband disagrees and always goes for the Classic Combo pizza.  It is good too, but not as pretty as the White Pizza.  Looks aren't everything, I know, but it is true in this case! They also have a ton of other things from burgers, sandwiches, steaks, brunch (on the weekends), lunch specials Monday-Friday, and even low cal choices.  I don't anything about those because I am a full fat kinda girl, which is probably why I'm not a size 2.  They even have  french fry options!  Now that is just awesome because sometimes you want skinny fries and sometimes you want wedge ones.  GENIUS! And of course, they have a ton of beer!  They make about a dozen different beers and even switch it up throughout the year in the different seasons.  For you non-boozers, they also make their own root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry cream soda.  I always go for the cream soda and I am always happy. The service is usually ok, but it does waver, which is why I gave this location 3 stars.  Food alone is easily 4 stars, but the service knocks it down.  Sometimes you go in and your server is on it, but sometimes, like this past weekend, it was a diaster.  Our food took 40 minutes to come out.  Some of it was hot, some lukewarm, and one had been under a heat lamp for way too long.  We were all so hungry (Warning, do not mess with my family when we are hungry because you WILL get hurt!), we didn't send it back because we were afraid it would take another 40 minutes and we had plans afterwards.  We were not the only ones with this problem either, as I heard the tables around us all complaining about the same things we were talking about.  The manager on duty wasn't particular helpful either and we didn't even see him until we were already 35 minutes into the wait.  We asked him about the food situation and he tried to make a joke and then blew us off.   I would say 80% of the time you will have a great experience, so definitely try it out.  And get some cream soda too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=280,3.96,3.86,3.86,3.1800000000000006,3.9000000000000004

They now have a great ENLIGHTENED menu if you want to keep the calories down -- my personal ENLIGHTED fave is the chicken ala fresca, but  the Garden Market Salad w/Blackened Chicken is a close second!  We love their pizza - if in the mood for a thick pizza filled with goodness.

They have several different samplers, including one with enough sizable samples to tranquilize Nancy Grace during a double murder trial. And they really mean full bar. In fact, they mean full everything. The secret of BJs is it's menu; everything is really pretty good, and that's a feat because they have a huge diversity of entrees. If you have that friend in your group who has specialized diet concerns and can only eat blue foods from islands that don't feature indigenous amphibians BJs can feed them. BJs is great for large groups for exactly that reason: everyone gets what they want. No matter how stupid it is. Mega Bonus: The waiter split our check with no muss nor fuss.

We have certainly gotten our share of inattentive servers (sorry to be sexist but the men tend to be the ones that leave us hanging for way too long, the women have been way more on top of their game here) and the hostess/seating people are fairly unfriendly. I always hate that the first experience walking in seems to be being ignored. Oh and the wait times can be insane, for that whole area of restaurants there, especially on a Friday/Saturday night......anyway, let's move on to the good shall we? The pizza - I think it is delicious, and this isn't even my favorite type of pizza, it is more of a deep dish, which I am usually not a fan of, but theirs is almost always pretty delicious. They had this mushroom, balsamic one that was SO FREAKING GOOD and I almost cried when I was told they took it off the menu, but alas, the Sweet Pig is pretty yummy too, so that is what we often get.  The other stuff - I have gotten some other dishes but honestly, I prefer the pizza over everything else. Can't really remember what I have ordered, which probably says something, but the last dozen times or so have been all about the pizza. Now on to the PIZOOKIES - Soooooooo yummy. Little pans of cookies served up warm with ice cream on top. We have even gone just for dessert a time or two, they are really that good. We also joined their rewards club and have earned enough points for free pizookies and $10 off our meals, so that is always a nice incentive to come back. They also run decent meal promos sometimes (something like soup or salad, pizza and pizookie for 2 for $20) so a super cheap lunch is always a good incentive too. The atmosphere is pretty typical for this type of restaurant, generally busy and somewhat loud, lots of TV's going, etc., but I find it to be a perfectly nice place to have a lunch or dinner out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=260,3.48,3.73,3.73,3.568,3.6300000000000003

Buffet style menu and then drinks were ordered and paid individually. BJ's is very accommodating with their catering options and if they can't, they'll try to take care of ya the best way they can. BJ's is great for a night out to have some drinks and a meal (if you like) to catch up with old friends or a gathering place to be with family.

I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a ""Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad"" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price, but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion, tomato, mozzarella, basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a ""Kids Pizza"" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy!

Every time our server spoke to us, I felt like we were being scoffed at. Not every teenager tips just below the minimum, so if that was the reason why the service was horrible, you won't be seeing me or my family here anytime soon. My party isn't stupid, we know the norms of tipping and dining out. I was excited to bring my foreign exchange student here to enjoy the highly regarded burgers, but the embarrassment my whole party experienced overshadowed it all. the waiter actually had the guts to scream at her because she couldn't hear him when he brought all the food to our table. first of all, the place is always filled with people, resulting in a volume problem. Second, she doesn't speak good English! we seriously had to endure him directly shouting at her and giving us attitude when she didn't speak up saying it wasn't her food, even going as far as to say ""you need to speak up next time.""

242,Scott P.,"Las Vegas, NV",680,172,97.0,5.0,2014-04-09,"I have two words for you: pi-zookie In certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone . All that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key.

I pointed out to the server that it looked like a disaster and her response was ""Yes, they do throw allot of stuff in there"". I took a few bites and it just tasted horrible. Sent it back and within a hour I was sick beyond belief. Not sure if it was the egg-rolls or the salmon but I'll never eat here again. They should have better controls to check the food quality before serving it. It only takes one time to lose a customer, especially when you get food poisioning.

I love the ambiance and the food is great. I love their signature pizookie's and their rootbeer.  Our waitress was not at all coordinated. She was in over her head I think because it was so busy. It took 15 minutes after we were seated for her to come by and ask what we would like to drink. Then it took another 20 minutes for her to actually come back to give us our drinks. This made me mad since I've never had such poor service at this restaurant before.  We ordered 2 appetizers which came out literally 5 minutes before we were served out entrees. On top of that our waitress was not really attentive to us and was kind of rude when we asked for sauces and other things.  Overall, I still love this restaurant, but I believe that if they do become busy the waitress/waiters should not neglect their tables and not be snippy if ketchup or other things are needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=100,3.8,3.79,3.79,3.34,3.794

My card was lost by a waiter on a previous visit. We were seated in a booth for two. A few minutes later, Nora, our waitress greeted us. She took our drink order and then our food order. I ordered the half sandwich and salad combination with the salad dressing on the side. My husband ordered the same thing except for no tomatoes on his salad. A few minutes later drinks and salads were brought out. My salad had salad dressing on it and my husbands salad had tomatoes on it. Strike one and two. No big deal, we will eat them rather than risk the rest of our food being spit in. Thirty minutes went by. No half sandwiches had been delivered. My husband was ready to get up and leave when Nora goes around, sees that we have not been served  our food and runs away before we can get her attention. She comes back a few minutes later with our food. My fries were cold and the sandwich was soggy on one side and crusty on the other side. It was obvious that our food had sat under the heat lamps for a long time. My husbands food was the exact same way. Nora, our waitress, was no where to be found, so we asked another server to get the manager.  Nora finally came over and went to get her manager. William M, one of the managers, came over to apologize for our food being cold and unsatisfactory. He offered us to remake our food at no cost. We did not have time to waste another 30 minutes for our food to be remade. He said he was going to talk to his staff about the quality of food that is served. Nora knew full well that the food she was serving us wasn't the BJ's quality standards that the manager was talking about. We go back to BJ's because we really like the food.

Our food also came out very quickly today. I was surprised! I got the half pasta and soup or salad lunch combo. I ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti and a bowl of clam chowder. Reason why I got soup was because the last time I had the house salad, I didn't really like it. It didn't have enough dressing, it seemed a little dry. The spaghetti was really not that spicy but had a light kick and a different type of tomato sauce, but it was enjoyable. It was really good price, about $9! My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a bread bowl which was about $8. Their clam chowder is really good! It comes out hot and fresh. He adds a little tobasco for more flavor, and I just like it the way it is. We had calamari for appetizer and it was delicious as well. It was crispy and a pretty decent size. I've seen it bigger at other places but I'm not complaining. This was about $10.25 I believe.  As for dessert, ALWAYS the pizookie! Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream is always the traditional way to go! Sooo yummy and always hits the spot. Because I'm a BJs card holder, I was able to get $10 off $35 or more, and we had just reached $36. So the deal was soooo good! Imagine if I had 4 people come and everyone ordered off the lunch menu.... What a deal!! This place is clean and friendly and has pretty good food. I've had their Cajun pasta and shrimp scampi, both very flavorful. I've also had the angel hair Classico which is not as flavorful but good if you don't want a strong flavored pasta.

The lunch special of a deep dish meat extravaganza pizza and salad were an ideal choice. The pizza was so hot I had to wait for it to cool. Still, an abundance of stretchy cheese with every slice. The salad was not a wimpy small afterthought. It was a dinner-plate of fresh tomato's, black olives, field greens, sweet red onion, hot-house cucumbers and field greens topped with a refreshing vinaigrette.  Service was five star. My handsome young waiter had just moved from Colorado and was a delight to talk with. He recommended sampling the root-beer.

In the larger restaurants in the chain, the noise level is slightly above average, and has even been noisy at times, but it's never been too loud. As I mentioned, BJ's brews it's own beer; you have 10 beers and a hard cider available to chose from.  They also carry a nice assortment of others beers as well, so you're not bound to their own brews.  By the way, the in-house root beer is delicious.  Be sure to give it a try during one of your visits.

I enjoy a good beer, and whether it's a BJ's house brew or a guest tap, I always find something hoppy and malty to drink. I usually patronize the bar area, which is my go-to at most establishments, and this one is non-smoking so it's always a good choice. Servers and bartenders are always great and if you can make it to a beer dinner I highly recommend it. Besides beer, I generally order stuffed mushrooms, potato wedges (not fries), salad (they have several that I like) or pizza. On a rare occasion I have a pizzookie. It's an awesome dessert, I just don't do sweet very often.  The mushrooms are probably my favorite menu item. I think they are stuffed with the spinach and artichoke dip, among other things, and I cannot get enough of them. The pizza is great. It's pan pizza, like pizza hut style only really good.

Have no fear about ordering here, you may not be totally wowed by your experience but you'll definitely not be disappointed.  My wife and I both ended up ordering the same thing: Santa Fe Salad. She got chicken, I got chicken and in addition the salmon (typically it's a substitution, I ordered double meat). I ordered mine without bell peppers as well. A bad restaurant would reply to removing bell peppers with ""Sorry the salad is pre-made we can't do subtractions."" BJ's just said ""okay"". That's a great first sight. As appetizers we had Chicken Potstickers and Potato Skins.  Let me just review all the food at once: for the price, I got larger portions than expected; the flavor was great, the food was cooked well, the variety of ingredients in the dishes was as-expected for potato skins, and was a pleasant surprise for the salads. I'm not sure why I don't give this a 5-star review. 4 seems like the right answer. While everything was good -- really good, just what I was looking for and up to my standards -- it is still a chain restaurant, and nothing really *pops* about it in a unique or outstanding way.  BJ's is definitely one of my go-to restaurants for classic, totally solid American-style food (even though I ordered a mexican-inspired entree salad and an asian-inspired appetizer).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=100,4.0,3.71,3.76,3.632,3.826

My dad and step mom took myself and kids here after a long day of planes, walking and driving. I was famished and would have devoured anything put in front of me. First of all, very nice space. Cozy, yet spacious. Modern, but comfortable. Our server was Xavier and he was delightful. We were taken care of at precisely the right pace. The flow of our meal was perfect, even for my overly-impatient father! Drinks came out quickly, my son ordered the house-made root beer and I stole a sip. Very good! My iced tea was fine and everyone else enjoyed theirs. Xavier made sure to refill my kids' drinks, and asking first if they could have more soda! Much appreciated. My step mom had a coupon for a free app so we chose the avocado egg rolls. We all enjoyed them. 3 whole egg rolls cut into 6 pieces. Just enough to kick off the meal. The menu is huge! It takes a minute to navigate. There is another chain restaurant that has a dessert gimmick (ahem CHEESECAKE) and a very large menu as well. I had a very sub par experience there so the large menu scared me. Glad to see my apprehension was misplaced! Kids meals were modestly priced at 5.99. Both of mine went for the mini corndogs, 8 of them! Fries were yummy too! I ordered the tomato bisque and the seared tuna salad. Wow. I have not one criticism and that is quite hard to do! I would eat these things every day if I could. The bowl of soup and the salad were the perfect amount of food, satisfying to the last bite. I usually ask for the dressing on the side, since almost always they drench it down, but theirs was done perfectly. Ingredients were well balanced and fresh. I was also pleased with the price point. $15.99!? I didn't pay, but I was surprised that it wasn't a $19.99 dish. Easy five stars.

It was fairly slow so I noticed everyone was cleaning.  I don't mean just wiping down the bar I mean the stuff that a lot of grubby places don't do every day.   The experience was great.  Tracy was fast, friend, knowledgable.  I asked a lot of questions and she patiently answered and since I was alone she came by and chatted a bit when she wasn't totally busy.  (I even asked questions about the spoon hanging from the tap because I was curious and other kind of dumb things that interested me.)

After hiking on the UYE: Hike at the Potato Knoll, I joined up with Robert. W for a post hike meal at BJ's. It was a hop and a skip northeast on State Route 159.   At 11:20 am, the parking lot, which is at the northwest corner of Route 159/Charleston at Pavilion Center across from Red Rock Resort was nearly full. That is a good sign.    Robert. W and myself sat toward the back of the restaurant where they have the microbrewery. My first impression was olfactory. There was a delicious smell permeating the restaurant. And we chatted and chatted. But when we chatted we were looking at a table minus menus. Where was the server? It seemed like we had spent an equivalent amount of time hiking from the Route 159 parking lot to the Potato Knoll until our waitress came on the scene. She half-apologized stating that she just started. ""Humm,"" I thought to myself, ""what about the servers who had been passing us with no sign of acknowledgement?""     After the waitress handed us our menus, it was difficult making a decision. This is one of those restaurants that serve good breakfast and lunch. I was in a lunch mood. Decisions! Decisions! Should I go for the roast beef? The chicken club? The portobello Swiss? I finally decided on the crispy jalapeño burger. After a 4.5 mile hike, there was no guilt chowing down this 1,350 calorie burger. The waitress never hurried us, and let me take my time choosing the sandwich. Between the time of ordering til the food reached the table, the waitress handed us our drinks. Regardless that this is a restaurant and microbrewery, I went for a Pepsi.    The crispy jalapeño burger was delicious but not exceptional delicious like the Spicy Miso Burger I ate in Bachi Burger last Sunday. The thick burger was topped with the right ingredients: housemate guacamole, smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes, and jalapeños. Equally as delicious as the crispy jalapeño burger was the potato wedges. This burger that is $11 and change includes either string fries or potato wedges. I favor potato wedges over string fries. These were tasty potato wedges. I felt that they could of filled the plate a bit more with the potato wedges.     BJ's was a good choice for the post-hike meal. Robert got to enjoy breakfast and I got to enjoy lunch. Based on this experience, I will Yelp out that BJ's serves good food but needs improvement in service.

First, Krystle, our server, was fantastic. She knew her stuff.  As my husband was choosing his ""Pick 4"" beers (@$6.95 great deal), she could tell what kind of beers he liked and gave him some suggestions. He ended up changing two to try something new. And he was happy he did. Because it has been a while since we've been to BJ's, asked our server what she would recommend as I wanted more of a dip. We went with her suggestion of the Pork chili verde Queso dip, and we were happy we did. Dinner was good. My husband with with a rack of ribs, while I went with the shrimp and asparagus penne. However, because I'm more of a noodle person, our server was okay with me changing penne to spaghetti noodle. And of course, we had dessert. Pizookie! With the amount of options, she suggested that we do a half-and-half. I choose the white chocolate macadamia nut while my husband choose Peanut Butter. Next time, we'll try not to fill up so much and go with the Pizookie Trio instead. And lastly, be sure you get that ""$10 off $35"" deal.

It very closely mirrors the quality of what I've experienced in Maui. After sharing that, I order the Cherry Glazed Salmon to go. Both were amazing. The restaurant is in between casual and formal. The bar is well-stocked, and the ambience is really nice. The place is fairly dimly lit, but just enough so you can still see your dining mates and your plate.

152,Jessica K.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,10,,2.0,2017-01-31,"Never had a horrible experience while dining in and their food is amazing. One of my favorite places to go get burgers and pasta. But whenever I order takeout online (which I do A LOT more often than dining in), EVERY single time they always forget one or more items! I'm not even being dramatic. It's literally every single time. Whether it's utensils, ingredients, sauces, sides, etc. For example, I ordered three burgers tonight. One of the burgers didn't come with onions when we added it online, only one burger came with a side of ranch when I specifically added three, they didn't add as much bleu cheese on the second burger than they normally do, and only gave us forks when I asked for take out utensils. Another time they forgot two sides of our fries. There has been more experiences of them not fulfilling my order, but those are just some examples. I order their burgers the most out of the rest of the menu and I kid you not, every time I go in to pick it up, they always ask me what fries I want when I always put it in online. I don't know if there's something wrong with the website or what, but as a busy person, it's annoying to have to wait. They're not even apologetic. I always tip well because I'm a hostess/takeout person myself, but the fact that they've always forgotten a part of my order and have me wait makes me not want to tip them at all. I don't know how they do it at BJ's, but at the restaurant I work at (which is a very big, chain restaurant that is very similar to BJ's), I pack everything (sauces, entrees, desserts, sides, etc.) and check everything twice to make sure I have everything. So either they do it differently at BJ's or the takeout specialist doesn't know how read and check the order. This really makes me not want to order takeout from BJ's anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=140,3.84,3.59,3.708,3.1760000000000006,3.69

However the quality of the food was terrible. First we ask for cokes and they kept giving us diet ones for some reason. We order poke bowl - don't get it, it never gets brought out but of course it's on the bill. Then my sister and I order the Nashville spicy chicken sandwich and mine is great, but they brought out the classic chicken sandwich instead for my sister. Instead of making her the correct sandwich they brought out some microwaved hot sauce to put on it. My nephew never got his side of fries (yet again it was on the bill.) finally the booth and the wall behind us was so gross and dirty. Didn't look like it was wiped at all for maybe days?! A spider bit my fiancé. I can't believe this happened to us especially while in summerlin! We spoke to Allen he was very nice and actually cared what was going on. Then the GM Paul came over and blamed all the errors on the waitress. And that wasn't the case. She took our order correctly and the people in the kitchen and servers where the ones messing things up. Along with the bus boys who clearly don't clean properly. He was so unprofessional and quick to place blame and had the nerve to say that we were ""complaining"" I let him know that customer service is his job and placing blame on someone won't solve the issue of the food being poorly prepared and the kitchen not making the food in the back. I let him know it's a difference between complaining vs facts. Facts was, the food wasn't good, the place was dirty and we didn't get our complete orders, yet was charged for them.

By the time my soup arrived, one of my friends had already finished her meal, and a second person was almost done.  We were there over an hour and a half.

I went to BJs on a Monday night when the restaurant is less than half full. I had a young (maybe 16-17 year old) Hispanic ""gentleman"" as my server. He never gave his name. He mumbled when taking my order and showed little interest in being polite. I hardly even saw my waiter. He had absolutely no interest in doing his job. The time he was actually on the floor, he was either chatting with other waiters at the bar or chatting with girls. While waiting for him come to the table and split our check, he spent 20 minutes talking with two girls one table, laughing and having a great time. No other server approached the table during this time. I tried to approach the bar to get the bartender to split the check, but he refused. A large, black woman (I assume from her clothes that she was the manager) was also just standing around. My friend made a snarky comment to her about the terrible service as we left; she responded like she was surprised and gave the weakest apology I have ever heard. To give proper credit, a short, white female (that was working in a busser/waiter assistant capacity) was extremely polite. She checked on our table twice and wasn't even our server. Everyone else was either black or Hispanic and couldn't care less. My friends and I were put in the corner and refused equal treatment. If you are non-white, I absolutely recommend BJs. The food is great and the wait staff will constantly check on you.

I am a true fan!  The difference is split between this location and another in the immediate are.  It would seem....I always choose this location.  The parking is in not F$%^@! up and the quality is solid!

131,Reed B.,"Orlando, FL",22,162,55.0,5.0,2017-11-18,"BJ's is one of those places that you go when you want something dependable, somewhat tasty and with something for everyone in your party.  This BJs hits all of those marks, AND manages to be the best one of the chain that I have been to.   Here's what put it over the top compared to its brethren.  - Quick service.   I have never had my food out that quickly in a busy restaurant.  And everything was cooked correctly!   - Awesome service!  Our waitress was extremely personable and professional.   My personal favorite item is the chicken pita tacos, but the burgers are great as well!  Pizza is actually my least favorite item but is also still quite yummy.  A pizzokie  is a required desert item.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2,3.96,3.74,3.684,,3.8280000000000003

137,Nicole T.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,9,,1.0,2017-12-08,Every BJ's employee we have encountered this evening has made us feel as if we were putting them out. From the receptionist (Hailey?) who was curt and not friendly when we called for seat-ahead to the waitress who was not happy when we asked to order beers from the happy hour menu - which we were seated in time for.

She genuinely cares about her guests and their experience at the restaurant, which is something I find so rare since most servers only care about money. She told me that she has been serving since the 90's but I think she should be doing a lot more! Her enthusiasm and passion should have her in a managerial position! Or at the very least her base pay should be raised. BJ's is blessed to have such an amazing employee! I would 10/10 request her every time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2?start=20,3.72,3.71,3.684,,3.7140000000000004
122,Loren R.,"Anchorage, AK",10,242,262.0,3.0,2017-12-18,Hmmmmm I wish I had taken a picture of the fish tacos I ordered.  They were really vegetable tacos.   I had to dig deep to find the insignificant piece of fish at the bottom.  It was the smallest portion of fish I've  EVER had in a fish taco.  To add to that....  it was the least inventive boring fish taco I've ever had. And I eat a lot of em on my travels.  NOT. The bj standard for sure  Salmon was good Salad was good Beer was good  Server forgot a beer.  No biggie.  Not the usual  5 star experience I'm  used to here  ------ Note.

At 12:30 I called to check on the order and the manager Ron answered and started making excuses that there was confusion with the order and that it was still at the restaurant. He never apologized and there was zero service recovery on his part. As a Summerlin resident who frequents this location, they have lost a loyal customer when all it would have taken would have been for the manager to give a sincere apology and ask how he could make things right. If you can't offer an effective delivery program you should discontinue it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-las-vegas-2,3.64,3.71,3.688,,3.6820000000000004
