245,Paul L.,"Carmel Valley, CA",50,251,3.0,4.0,2012-02-25,"Food was good, probably my favorite chain restaurant. The only other location I've been to was in Westwood almost twelve years ago (don't think there were very many of these restaurants back then) and I was very excited to see that they had one in Reno. It wasn't as good as I remembered it, but the pizza and pizookies were still very good. Don't know if the Westwood location is just better, or if they've sacrificed quality over the years as they expanded. The menu was huge compared to what I remember. We're getting one soon near where I live, and I'm looking forward to it (after the new wears off a bit).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=240,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.408,3.4400000000000004

I order their Jambalaya and always make it a point to separate the dish in half. It is HUGE! The pazzoookiissss are to die for! I know it's just a cookie topped with ice cream, but oh man, how can you not get happy with that combo! Another stample that goes fab with my jambalaya is their Peachy Keen Sangria! YUMMMMMMMMMM! Just thinking about a glass of such makes me want to head to BJ's!  Do make it a point to make reservations if your party will be large.

I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and it was served to me at some weird temperature between lukewarm and room temperature. The pizza had obviously been microwaved. I think this place has the worst pizza in town for the price. (Ten bucks for a mini pizza? That's microwaved?!) So suffice to say the pizza was pretty gross. One member of our party had the chicken fried steak and the meat was chewy and old. The people that ordered hamburgers weren't very impressed either.

I was offered pazuki 6 times.  Twice before my meal even got there, once while I was still eating it, twice while I was finishing my beer, and again when the check came.  The staff's attempts at an upsale would have been more subtle had they tried to wipe my butthole with a chocolate cookie when I went to the bathroom.  Again, completely rude and unnecessary. I worked in retail when I was younger and was taught these techniques to try and sell more warranties.  We called it, ""introducing specific products"" and ""mention early and often"".  Its really obvious that this is a crappy management team that is out of their retail element trying to increase sales because every waiter I have had at this restaurant does this.  Shut up and let me tell you what I want, this isnt Best Buy.

There were 6 of us...and they didn't even bring out 6 for each of the foods. Dissappointing! It did take a long time to get our drinks too and most of us ordered water. So we got there at 11:40 and then we checked the time and it was 12:40....WE WERE WAITING FOR AN HOUR to get our food. It finally came and my Grilled Chichen pasta was so cold and my bosses burger and fries were cold too! Even one of the artists compained about his salad. Not exceptable! So they made our  two dinners....then forgot and then made everyone else's (Chef Ramsey would of fired the chef). We did complain and they offered to take it back....but hello...this was a celebration lunch and we have our work to get back to, so we did not have time. Then they offered desserts on the house.....UHHH...stupid...we DON'T HAVE TIME!!! They could of atleast offered 50% off the check or the meals that were cold to be taken off the check. Then we were all eating fast because of the time.  I recommend not going to BJ's with over 4 people. Very dissappointing. And if you see the place is filled up....don't even bother going in. You won't get served correctly. If you can't handle a busy restaurant...why are you even open?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=180,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.0480000000000005,3.4000000000000004

I honestly don't recall the experience from the previous time as it was a few years back, but this time our waitress was very fast and always attentive (pet peeve = my water glass is empty and that is my only beverage.

My whole family and I went for New Year's dinner Jan 1st, 2014 and were soo disappointed. My husband, me and my brother-in-law ordered the jalapeno burger. I asked for mine to be well done not, taste like saw dust. My husband's burger and brother-in-laws burger, even though they both asked for medium, both burgers came out tasting like saw dust. How do you screw up on a burger? It was the worst, tasteless burger ever. I seriously wanted to throw up. My kids got the 6 inch cheese pizza and they didn't want to finish eating it. My son used to love their cheese pizzas and would finish the whole thing. This time, he only had a few bites. There was no tomato sauce or paste on the pizza. THe pizza was dry. My sister and mom and dad really wanted a deep dish pizza, but they ran out. So, My sister and my mom and dad had the hand tossed vegetarian pizza. My mom was like, something's missing. Again, the pizza sauce or tomato paste was missing. That's basic. Overall, worst food ever. It's sad when McDonald's has better food than BJ's.

He had been going on and on about wanting to have dinner here for a while. We had tried previously to go to the Sparks N.V. location for some soup and hamburger and it was very good. We thought we'd try dinner. Normally we go to Texas Roadhouse or Tamarack Junction. This was a bad choice. The service spot on, our waiter Nate was excellent. Attentive, engaging, funny and my husband with no filter usually banters and Nate was laughing and just as funny. He made suggestions everything sounded like it would awesome. This however was not the case. I ordered chicken parm, my husband Joe ordered balsamic chicken. He also ordered salad and I had stuffed mushrooms Joe is allergic to them. The salad looked really good, look being the key word it was a bit wilted and it was to sweet and the lettuce tasted odd. He thought it was his imagination he asked me to taste it. It was not is imagination. I then had the mushrooms with spinach. They were very good, I am picky because my favorite place to any kind of stuffed mushrooms another chain. Carino's in south Reno N.V. Nate came back he was very nice and fast service. He then brought out dinner. I took one bit of the chicken parm it was ok, sauce was way to bitter.Joe's was way to sweet for him we switched. It was tolerable, but still tasted funky.  We then tried desert. I will say the pazookie as the hot cookie deserts with ice cream on top very good. I had red velvet and Joe had Oreo cookie. Dinner pricing was a little high just shy of $60.00. For what we had food wise not worth it. I am usually very hesitant to review like this, but I was so bummed.

My baby girl ordered the kid's mini corn dogs with a side of steamed veggies; carrots and broccoli, and chocolate milk to drink.  I was in the need for some warmth, so I requested hot tea for my drink, which came with a large lemon slice and a mini hot water pot and two tea bags on a separate saucer.  For dinner, I tried their 'new' kale and roasted brussel sprouts salad (baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette).   I did substitute the goat cheese with feta, since that's my preference.   The food came out in a timely manner, was quite tasty, and we both cleared our plates.  Our waitress was ok, she did well taking our order, bringing out our drinks, and refilling my daughter's chocolate milk.  I don't think she ever introduced herself, which is what I'm accustomed to. She didn't ask about my tea, and didn't check on us much really.  She was helpful with updating my BJ's Rewards, and honoring my e-mail for a free mini pizooki. Her service wasn't bad per se, it just seemed all business versus adding a personable touch.  Who knows, maybe she was just trying to get through a rough day, and the best she could do was her job with a smile.   Many of the tables were filled and the tv's were displaying the NFL Network, baseball, and college basketball.  It wasn't too loud, and my girl and I were able to enjoy our conversation.  I like to come to BJ's with my girl or sometimes with friends to eat and hang out.  I would recommend it for casual dining and I'll be back the next time my sweet tooth craves those pizookies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=60,3.0,3.29,3.29,3.2760000000000007,3.174

The servers were not only polite but friendly and comfortable to have around. They set up the buffet beautifully and even helped serve the cake which we didn't even purchase from them. Our party was such a success that we nearly overstayed our 2 hr time limit without being aware that the time was over and we hadn't even cut the cake.

Well, let me count the ways. 5 star service: your servers are always perfectly attentive and the food always arrives in great time. I never feel pushed or manipulated and I appreciate choosing to get dessert all on my own devilish desire. 5 star food: I love your food. It's not like it's the healthiest fare, but it's the GOOD kind of bad. I loved the Bison Burger (only like 500 calories) and it was SO worth it. The Ahi Salad isn't bad either, and I LOVE all the deep-dish pizzas. Seriously, the food is so good, I would love to come around more often, but my stomach or triglyceride levels doesn't have the ability to ingest your caloric provisions. 5 star BEER: OMG, I love your beer. Jeremiah Red, P.M. Porter, you name it, it's so freakin' DELICIOUS. But damn it, would you please sell it in stores because I can't always make it in JUST for a beer! 5 star atmosphere: Thankfully it's never been crazy loud, crazy busy, and just flat out --crazy--. If you do get busy, it's never been so loud and crowded that I felt I had to leave or else risk insanity. Of course, I do try to avoid the busiest times (who wants to wait an hour for a table?).

So, unless something moves me to do so, I don't write about it. Unfortunately, something motivated me to write and it wasn't the food. First and foremost, the service was excellent..  The food, was fair to crappy. I'm disappointed in this place. On the table was a tent advertiser stating that we can call ahead and save time!  But, for the most part, when I dine, I don't want to rush in and out. I want to relax.  The dinner was a burger night. Meaning, I limit myself to one burger a month. I'm sorry PETA people, but I'm better now than I used to be.  We were seated after a short 5 minute wait. Which wasn't bad at all. The waitress came over and took our drink order. My dad got a diet soda and I got an ice tea. It arrived in short order (no pun intended) and our order was taken. The waitress was very happy and cheerful. Almost to a fault, but it was nice. The food finally came.... within a few minutes of ordering it. I would say that it wasn't even 5 minutes. Wow, that was just way too fast! It looked good. I tried a fry. It was nasty. The fries were luke cold. No really, they were only warm at best. They were soggy and just drooped. I think there's medication for that. That was my biggest disappointment.  My dad's fries were good. He ordered the wedge cut fries whereas I ordered the shoestring fries. For me, and my dad, the fries are as important as the burger.  When the waitress came by and asked how things were, I told her the fries were crappy (Yes, I actually said it that way). She asked if I wanted new fries and said yes. Less than 1 minute later, a plate of HOT fries appeared. I may be weird, but, if fries are to be served in a restaurant, shouldn't they always be served HOT and FRESH?  I was happier with this fries. Now, onto the burger. How can a place like BJ's serve me a fresh made burger in less than 5 minutes when they are at near 90% capacity? I put two and two together and realized that tent ad on the table to save time and the speed at which the food comes out meant one thing. They are trying to pump more customers into the restaurant.  Another thing. The hamburger prices are way too cheap. Most of the burgers were between $7.00 to $9.00. For a big place like BJ's? I bet you that their profitability is a teeny bit. But, if you can pump those consumers through, you can make it up. Of course there is the high margin products, such as their beer, which they are noted for and I didn't order.  So, why am I complaining about the speed at which the burger came out? Have you ever heard the phrase, haste makes waste? The burgers had to be sitting on the side. Pre-cooked. When the order would come in, the patty would get the necessary condiments and then out the door to the patron. GREASY!  Tasty, yes, but greasy. And, the fries too were greasy. Especially the sorry soggy droopy fries.  BJ's was a great place. I used to enjoy going there and the burger prices were the same 8 years ago. In fact, their prices should have gone up and kept the quality at the same level.  Instead, the prices have remained the same and the quality of the food has dropped.  -------------------------------------- Bottom line - Disappointing But, great service!!! Would I go back there? No.  Good service or not, when I go out for burger night, I want a good burger and good fries. It's only once per month, so it better be good!

Service at the door and at the table were mediocre. We were in somewhat of a rush on our way to a movie, so we ordered right away. We ordered a pizza, making sure to emphasize ""no tomatoes"" and ""half no onions"", and the waitress confirmed. The pizza came, with tomatoes. We disappointedly said ""we ordered no tomatoes, but we don't have time for a new order so it's fine, oh well"". We started eating & realized there were also onions on the entire pizza. I ended up scraping off all toppings & eating plain dough. When the waitress brought the check (never checking in to see if our food was satisfactory), we informed her the pizza was all wrong & we weren't happy. She just said ""oh sorry, I wrote it down right, it's the kitchen's mistake"", took our bill & left.

My husband and I both for burgers that were cooked to our liking, my friend ordered a pizza and loved it, and my daughter got chicken tenders and mashed potatoes and also loved it. They gave us all big portions and everyone had leftovers to take home. It was around $50 for my husband, daughter and I to eat. But for good service and absolutely tasty food, the price was well worth it.

This location is no different. The old blonde waitress with glasses was so rude. We waited well over 20min with no greeting, no service, and when she finally graced us (ha!) with her presence she was just a you know what. She clearly didn't want to be there, had a bad attitude, no apologies, no greeting, no introduction, no welcoming vibe what so ever. So done with that. Just because you hate your job and whatever else your problem was don't pass that along to other people. Management didn't really care to be honest. Acted pretty fake to me.

""Waste"" from the brewing process is picked up by a local farmer who uses it as feed for his cattle. It is a win-win because it frees up BJs bin and the farmer gets feed for his cattle! I would expect this from a mom and pop place but not from a chain. As for the food, I have a few things that have been really good. One of my favorites is the BBQ Bison Burger. At only 650 calories for the whole meal (it includes a slaw with a tangy dressing) The burger is ""topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, seared green chilies and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce."" I wasn't sure what to expect the first time I ordered it. I thought it might be dry but it was delicious and juicy. I couldn't wait to have it again so went back about a week later. On my most recent visit I ordered the lunch size Cajun pasta with a Caesar salad. This particular time the service wasn't so great but other times service has been fine. The Caesar salad was quite large so I wasn't able to eat much of the pasta but that turned out to be a good thing. I was able to get a whole other meal out of the pasta! Yum! The pasta had a ""creamy tomato sauce with blackened chicken breast, fire-roasted red bell peppers and red onions tossed with fettuccini noodles and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and green onions."" I was impressed with the chicken. It wasn't dry at all and had lots of flavor. I'm not usually a fan of red sauce but this was a creamy red sauce and had just the right amount of heat.

76,Stacia D.,"Reno, NV",185,121,153.0,1.0,2016-01-15,"Bjs by the summit mall is usually packed, so my husband and I decided to bypass the wait and got our food to go.  He called, talked to Brooke, and ordered 2 bowls of soup and asked if they still had pumpkin ale to fill our growlers. She said they did, and that our order would be ready in 20 minutes.  When we arrived, we parked in the to go parking but decided to go in to get the growlers filled. I was super excited about the pumpkin ale, it's my favorite! We walked in the TO GO entrance and was greeted by Brooke and another young boy. There were a small group of younger teens standing there talking to both employees, but stepped to the side for their friends to help Us.  We told them the name on the order and she quickly rang it up. ""Your total is 45.34."" She proudly announced. I do not think anywhere do you fill two 32 oz growlers and get two bowls of soup does it cost 45 dollars sweet girl. Matt and I both look at each other, and said what is so expensive? She told Us the growlers were 12.50 a piece and the bowls of soup were 7 apiece and Matt's bread bowl made up the extra. I turned around to look at their very large sign that says ""32 oz growlers refills 6 dollars. I turn back around and ask her if that's still the current price. She starts laughing and says ""oh I always do that. Sorry you are right, let me go find my manager to correct this.""  She takes the growlers and scours the store to find a manager. 5 minutes later she returns and corrects the bill with her manager's slide card. No manager though. She rings Us up for 30 dollars. This seems more appropriate. I hand her my card and she prints me a receipt. She walks away to the bar to check on the growlers. She quickly comes back and hands me the menu. She explains they are in fact out of pumpkin ale.  In between trying to help Us, Brooke is busy trying to ""hang out"" with this group of friends that happens to be hanging around. Very unprofessional. WHERE IS HER SUPERVISOR??!  At this point I'm frustrated with her. We specifically asked when we called if they had the pumpkin ale and she said she checked and they in fact did. Then with all the wrong totals, waiting for her to fix it etc I almost just asked for her to give me our money back, But since we had been waiting to eat now for close to an HOUR I decided to just follow through with our original plan. My husband and I picked two other beers for the growlers to be filled with. We waited another 10 minutes and left.  When we got home we take our soups out of the bag and they aren't even luke warm.

The not so good:  - It can get really loud in there on a Friday night.  - The foyer can get a bit crowded.  Once you check in and they give you a buzzer kindly step away from the hostess desk.    - It's a chain restaurant.  At times it's filled with kids.  I'm not against kids by any means but sometime kids are kids.  So, it's kid friendly or you've been warned -- you decide.

A few mistakes here and there, but not enough to cause a stir or a phone call.  Something is amiss with the online ordering system, as now twice I've ordered pizza with EXTRA cheese, which spat out as pizza with NO cheese. Yes, I am so worried about my cheese calories as I've ordered the 5 meat pizza (not). Then, now twice in a row, the boneless wings came with NO SAUCE. I chose the rootbeer glaze both times (it won't let you advance until you choose a sauce) and the wings came unsauced. I've tried to substitute crispy chicken for grilled chicken in a salad, which came with NO chicken at all. I'd had enough.  I called the restaurant this time, irritated. We spend at least $100 there a week on both dine in and curbside. After triaging with the curbside attendant over the phone, the manager, Daniel, finally decided to assist me. At first he offered to make me another pizza for free ""if you want"", so I could drive 45 minutes round trip to come get it. Um, no. Then he said obviously something is wrong with the online ordering system, so to ensure accuracy I should not use it. Um, that's why it's there? So I don't have to call and do the whole person process? Lastly, he took my email address and said he would send me a gift card equivalent to the botched items to use by the end of that evening.

46,Rei R.,"Reno, NV",321,132,181.0,4.0,2016-04-29,"This review rightfully begins as a cautionary tale: WATCH. YOUR. STEP. The two-step platform from the lobby to the dining room floor is a cruel mistress that's taken many a hungry patron and rushing server alike to a short but tragic tumble to the cold and unforgiving tile. Boldfaced signage and verbal warnings only go so far to help since it's such negligible steppage. Just stay sharp to avoid falling flat on your face for all of BJ's to see. Speaking from experience: don't text and walk or these steps will make you look like a certified doofus. BJ's is my guilty pleasure chain. The quality of food is always a peg above the other casual dining joints -- never mindblowing but always satisfying -- and the service at this South Reno location has always been spot on. I am admittedly a fan of their in-house brews; I've gone through enough flights to have tried them all, and they span from meh to great. The Nutty Brewnette is probably my favorite of the bunch. I'm mad for their apps: calamari and flatbread is always a safe bet. During my last visit, I brought a party of four in for a 1:30 Tuesday lunch with virtually no wait. Not as busy and not as noisy as usual. Great. I ordered the North Beach Mahi-Mahi off of the ""EnLIGHTened Menu."" This was less of a play towards being calorie conscious and more about me just wanting some simple fish. It was a hint too bland, and I'd probably love it with something other than couscous, but it was filling. The rest of the table opted to share a large pizza. Word of warning: BJ's doesn't carry ""regular"" pizzas and only offers flatbread style tavern-cut or deep-dish, so settle on one of the extremes or peruse the other entrees. As someone who swears by Lou Malnati's, I cannot fully condone the pseudo-deep-dish travesty happening here. BJ's main feature starting out was their SoCal twist on deep-dish, but their offerings just don't measure up to a true Chicago-style pie. You're serving a meat medley quiche at best, BJ's! Honestly, I'd be up in arms in angry protest... if it wasn't so damn tasty. They turned out to be out of large chicken bacon ranch pizzas, which was initially disappointing, until management came in mega clutch, offering us a medium and a small -- which meant more square inches of fake-deep-dish goodness! God bless BJ's for giving us a marginally great alternative to the unholy horde of mid-range restaurants that litter every street corner and strip mall. My only qualm is that damned step that trips me up every visit, but even then, I'm glad that it keeps me on my toes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=60,3.48,3.56,3.56,3.8560000000000003,3.5280000000000005
32,Kristy C.,"Reno, NV",382,626,323.0,5.0,2016-05-10,"Writing a review for a place like BJ's is hard and easy at the same time. It's easy because we've all been there so you (the reader) can definitely relate to what I'm talking about. You know what kind of food they serve and have probably had both good and bad experiences there.  It's hard, though, because you always want to try to contribute something new when reviewing a place and that can be hard to do when it's so familiar.  I decided to write this review after having two stellar experiences with employees, and really think that the service and attention at this location is one of the best I've had at the chain. On one visit I ordered the macaroni and cheese. It wasn't as cheesy or saucy as I would have liked, and the bartender immediately noticed I wasn't super happy with my choice. He offered to get me something different, asked if I needed anything while I waited, and I noticed that he wrote ""please add a little extra sauce"" on the computer after I ordered the chicken alfredo as a replacement. Attentive, action-oriented, and thoughtful--pretty much my favorite qualities in a bartender.  The next visit the bartender was just as attentive and thoughtful (different bartender). I expressed that I didn't like the pizza at BJ's because of the lack of sauce (what can I say, I like sauce!), and she came up with a ton of options to help us take care of that. She checked back multiple times to make sure everything came out as expected, that we were happy with our food, and was just generally really good at taking care of us. Again, excellent bar service.

They use a deep dish pizza crust that made it tasty and good even later in the evening when I took it home, because I wanted some leftovers.

31,Brandy W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",83,460,45.0,5.0,2016-11-19,"It's a chain restaurant, but in my opinion, the food is good. We've been to both locations in Reno and Sparks and both are great, but we like this one best (and not just because it's down the street from our house).  The pizza is legit, but I recommend deciding on that and ordering before your drinks even, because it takes awhile to cook, especially on weekend nights. A medium deep dish is perfect for our family of 4 (ages almost 3 and 5 and two adults). My kids each take down a slice and we are left with a few slices each as well. If you want leftovers, go for a large deep dish. Or if your kids are slightly older, that should do it without leftovers. They have a new vegan ancient grains soup and it's awesome. I'm vegetarian, but I thought it was delicious no matter if you enjoy meat or not. You can't go without finishing it off with a pizookie. We love the triple chocolate one. Seriously, crazy good.  Tip: Download the app and put yourself on the list so you can beat the people who come in on foot. We arrived tonight on a whim and as I waited in line, I just checked myself in before the few other parties ahead of us. We got to the front desk and I told them we arrived. We were seated before lots of other parties, which is so nice with a couple of small kids who don't like waiting! They will text you when you table is ready!

My personal favorites include: wedge salad, broccoli cheddar soup, the spicy pig tavern cut pizza, California chicken club sandwich, and the salted caramel pizookie.   Secondly, the service is usually pretty good. On my last visit, Damian M. was our waiter. He was one of the best waiters I've had. He was helpful, patient, kind, and really easy to connect to. He must have filled my water glass six times, and nothing says ""quality server"" quite like frequent water refills do. Damian did an excellent job! Third, everything is reasonably priced.

Once I got home and unpackaged all of the food I ordered, the small serving sizes and (lack of) freshness of the food were apparent.  The serving sizes would have been appropriate for a young child, not an adult. The chicken tender combo was missing the dipping sauce, and the chicken itself was overcooked and dry. Not unlike something you could get in the freezer aisle of your grocery store. The French fries that came with them were also old and dry. The calamari we ordered was decent. It seemed a little undercooked and overly chewy. Lastly, the salads we ordered were so light on the dressing that they might as well have been plain lettuce.

111,Lydia M.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,2.0,2017-05-16,"I was in there this last Friday and the service was less that exceptional. The server started off very friendly but in time began to become rude and annoyed. At one point she walked away in the middle of taking drink orders and just started taking TWO OTHER TABLES ORDERS. Once she finally brought the drinks my friend had ordered a whisky sprite and she brought him a whisky and water so he asked her about it and she said it was probably just sitting there and watered down?! She rarely checked on us and when it came time to split the bill took 20 minutes to bring us our check. There were only 6 of us, it does not take 20 minutes to split a bill. (My friends and I work at another restaurant it takes 5 minutes to split a small check) So we went up to the host stand and payed up there and the host was so rude. It was the short red head one. She rolled her eyes multiple times and treated us horribly. We asked if we could leave the check up front and she rolled her eyes again and said ""um I guess?"" She must have been new because she clearly has no idea how to treat customers.

The first time it took close to 30 minutes for a burger and sandwich on a weekday. When the food arrived it was clear it had been sitting a while. The bread was soggy and the fries were cold.  Tried again today, a Wednesday, and received the same quality service. Ordered a pizza for my husband, I saw that the spicy pig was on tavern cut so I figured ordering a spicy pig would be specific to that style of pizza. Waitress didn't ask if I wanted tavern or deep dish. Ordered a steak dip for me. We waited for 30 minutes and watched people who had come in 10-15 minutes after us get their food. We asked what was up and they said the an jus for mine was what they were waiting for. AU JUS! Which meant yet again our food was sitting and getting soggy. Right before the food got there a spider fell in my lap!! I freaked obviously and the waitress said is it gone? And we said we think so and then she left! No apologies or empathy or anything. Food got there and I'm feeling my skin crawl. My husband got a deep dish instead of tavern cut. Wish we'd been asked what we preferred instead of having it assumed. And both of our dishes were soggy. We just asked for the check so we could leave. The waitress said ""sorry about all the stuff"" and handed us a check for $50.

Our server Damian M took the time to tell us all the specials and made some dynamite recommendations! The house made root beer and orange cream soda were amazing! The burgers were definitely above average and not at all what you would expect for a low price point! The highlight was definitely Damian though! What an amazing server!! My only negative feedback is that the host was busy chatting with a server when we came in and seemed to be ""bothered"" by us coming in.

They have one EXTRA LARGE flat screen TV on split screen mode adorning the bar area. I was sitting in a booth about 30 feet away and had no problem being able to see or hear the sports commentary.  Food  Appetizer   Crispy Calamari This dish arrived at our table at a nice hot temperature, with the option of dipping the calamari into either the marinara or lemon garlic aioli. The calamari texture was perfect not rubbery and dressed in a light batter.   Entrée   Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe Burger I recommend this burger with two thumbs up. The sweet flavored Applewood Bacon, housemade guacamole, red onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Chipotle mayo, tomatoes, and jalapeno was a heart warming dose of deliciousness. And not the heartwarming heartburn I was expecting. Just the contrary, the heat from the jalapenos was mild, allowing you to enjoy the dish rather than being consumed by an overbearing portion of spicyness.  Served with a side of fries on a metal baking sheet one can't be possibly be required to show any restraint when consuming this all American delicacy.   Chicken Tenders with Fries One bite of the tenders fills your senses with the crispy crunchy batter followed closely by moist savory chicken. Served with a savory honey mustard​ and ranch dressing for dipping.   Triple Chocolate Pizookie  A little too chocolatey for me. I think the dish would be perfect if you substitute the chocolate ice cream for vanilla. Perhaps then the dish wouldn't have been overbearing.  Overall Like all restaurants my experience is based on atmosphere, timely service, order accuracy, customer service, and of course the food itself.  My experience at BJs hit on all notes.

Of course, we all ordered something different , from salmon to pizza, but it was all delivered within a relatively short time and no mistakes were made -everyone got exactly what they ordered. The food was plenty and very tasty. And because we needed to get the students back to the school by 3:30pm, the server put in our dessert order of pazoolas early (they take a while to bake) -halfway through our meal so there was no wait time in between, and we could meet our deadline.

We were seated right away. There are a lot of tables and a bar area also. We saw at least 9 big screen TV's in the place. Most had some type of sports playing. The place is dimly lit but enough to see well.  For those who don't know, BJ's is a chain restaurant with about 190 locations under a few different names across the U.S. It is based out of Huntington Beach, CA and is publicly traded on the Nasdaq. The menu is pretty extensive and features Italian based items with other American foods. They brew their own beer (about 13 varieties) and make their own root beer which my wife loves. We placed drink orders. Of course my wife got the root beer and I chose to try their own Jeremiah red. The red beer was pretty tasty. My wife ordered the salmon while I succumbed to my Italian heritage and ordered the deep dish pepperoni pizza with extra sauce, of course. The food arrived in a timely fashion. My wife said the salmon was fabulous and I loved the pizza. We even ordered a monkey bread pazooki for desert, delicious! Conner M. our server was great and kept checking on us.

I have some very severe and life threatening  food allergies and am very careful about telling servers about them so I don't, you know, die. This was the first time in years that I forgot to do so, but as I've eaten at this restaurant before, I knew what to avoid so I wasn't too worried (I made sure nothing I ordered had any nuts listed in the ingredients I didn't participate in the appetizers because I was unsure about the ingredients). Out comes our food and I notice something strange--almonds, or what looked like them, on my pasta. I have my boyfriend take a bite and he unfortunately confirms my suspicions.  We immediately alert the server who apologized profusely and takes the pasta, bringing it back to the kitchen to be replaced. Luckily everything turned out fine, the wait staff was amazing, and I didn't end up needing to use my EpiPen.  Here's the issue, though--if I had taken a bite, it is very possible that something serious may have happened to me, and I definitely would have gone to the hospital. It's not too much to ask, right? That a chef doesn't add ingredients to a dish without listing it? Because if it happened to me then it probably has happened to other people. All in all I probably won't go back, not because the food wasn't delicious or that the wait staff had any issues, but because I shouldn't have to risk serious health problems when I eat pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.44,3.67,3.54,2.8920000000000003,3.5780000000000003

Despite the fact they were initially super busy, they handled our order quite promptly and with a friendly demeanor.  By the time 8:30 rolled around and the busy holiday Friday night dinner crowd cleared out, the need for speed and to make tables available immediately vanished.  Fast forward, or rather painfully slow forward 30 minutes later for dessert, some thin baked cookies I could have baked in 7 to 8 minutes at most in my kitchen with a scoop of ice cream and by the time the lackluster fare reached our table, I just desperately wanted to go home! The one or should I say 2 bright spots in this experience were the server and bartender who were friendly, kind and attentive and went above and beyond to attempt to make up for any mishaps. I understand it appears they have some issues to iron out and it could be a staff shortage or another thing, but I was not happy about waiting longer for a simple dessert than the entirety of our wait time for our drinks and dinner so the kitchen manager may need to regulate when the staff takes breaks etc. if nothing else to be sure patrons don't all of a sudden get hit with an absolute stand still.  Additionally, maybe the friendly blond at the reception desk could take over greeting of patrons. She was polite, smiling and and professional when I asked for assistance and is clearly more adept at working with the public. Overall, We will be back as it is one of my local Damonte area faves, but some basic changes are in order to ensure continued customer satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.52,3.63,3.556,,3.5860000000000003
16,K L.,"Reno, NV",1,18,2.0,4.0,2017-12-04,"This may be a chain restaurant but this particular location is great. We always, always sit at the bar,  and typically order appetizers and sometimes lunch. I have to say, the food is pretty good. The bar tenders and wait staff are very friendly, helpful, and professional. We return because of one bar tender as he remembers us and knows exactly what drink we'd like!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.48,3.66,3.556,,3.5880000000000005
9,Terri H.,"Eugene, OR",42,66,40.0,5.0,2017-12-09,"Last night I ordered BJs for delivery through a company call EatStreet . I ordered at 6:20 pm by 10:30 I still had not received my food. I called BJ's and due to not fault of them what so ever they felt terrible and the manager Cody who was at the airport hurried to the restaurant and he personally delivered my order free of change and threw in a piezookie . They were so kind and such good customer service , they didn't have to do what they did due to a horrible delivery company !! Thank you again MGR cody from Las Vegas who came here to deliver my food and to the great service in Reno  .. thanks again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.6,3.67,3.56,,3.6420000000000003
19,David D.,"Carson City, NV",19,9,,5.0,2017-12-11,"Always great food. I Got the Ribeye steak and it was awesome, I would put that steak up against any steak house in Reno. We had the best waitress named Taylor. She was very attentive and sweet and never let our glasses go dry. Ask for her it will make you dinning well worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.64,3.67,3.572,,3.6580000000000004
13,Ghordan P.,"Reno, NV",0,10,,2.0,2017-12-23,"Disappointed to say the least. There were items missing from my order, the lettuce in my salad was welted and soggy even though I got the dressing on the side and my pizza was burnt and cold. I've never had a problem ordering in house but $52 for delivery, I was hoping for much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.56,3.68,3.564,,3.6320000000000006
12,Lawrence M.,"Reno, NV",6,7,5.0,1.0,2017-12-24,"Where to begin... we ordered the sampler platter and asked for extra marinara. I guess that was our mistake expecting them to have items on the menu. Or at least let us know that they may be out of some items when we ordered before filling the order. My date only eats boneless wings and usually this isn't a big deal as it is on the menu. But when they fill the order and bring it to the table the should not say they can't substitute items when they needed to substitute an item they had no problem making an exception. We asked for an extra side of marinara and didn't bring it but we asked a second time and the lady walked by and dropped it on the table and said ""this is the last of it"" the marinara looks like they took it off another table that didn't finish it.  At this time no manager has come to the table to discuss the issue... oh he arrived and appeared to have no idea why we would think these were issues. I wish this was the first time I had issues here. The last time I had a rude server and wrote an email to the national website. I was offered a coupon and this was my return visit after that.  They comped the check which is nice but they should not expect a return visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.4,3.65,3.552,,3.5500000000000003
5,Judy A.,"Reno, NV",1,13,1.0,3.0,2018-01-11,Don't understand why BJs advertises specials when they are are always running out!  Has happened three different times different nights.  Really BJs?!  Order more food if you are going to advertise a special!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.32,3.67,3.548,,3.5300000000000002
10,Alex C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,2,2.0,2.0,2018-01-12,"So we love going to BJ's, but this one has been the worst one we have ever been to. The waitress was rude, careless, and did not want to give us the time of day to even make sure we were taken care of. As for the food it was mostly good except the chicken was burnt and the pazooki was raw. I'm so disappointed in this BJ's because I've never had a bad experience at one. It's always my go to place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno,3.24,3.66,3.544,,3.492000000000001
