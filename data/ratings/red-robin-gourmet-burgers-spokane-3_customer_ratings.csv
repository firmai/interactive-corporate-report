I stopped in the other day when I was out shopping and I was alone. And I got the impression that just because I was by myself and she knew she wouldn't get a very large tip from my table, she ignored me. I had to ask another waitress for refills and someone else brought me my food.

17,Casey P.,"New York, NY",37,373,34.0,5.0,2012-09-02,"My dad and I came here on a Saturday afternoon to watch the Hawaii-USC game. We were fortunate enough to bump into an employee on our way in and he helped us out. Initially we walked through the bar because they had a couple of televisions set up there. But since I was only 20 at the time I couldn't sit there. Instead the waiter seated us in the restaurant area with a good view of the television. He actually made the effort to adjust the television and change the channel so we could watch. Our waiter really went above and beyond to make sure we had an enjoyable experience. When it came time to order our food, we had a different server, a friendly young woman. She was prompt, and accommodated my request for a vegetarian substitute. She also moved a plant that was blocking our view of the television. The food was wonderful - try the BBQ burger with a veggie pattie. It has onion straws, lettuce, cheese, and barbeque seasoning. They did a great job with my order. Our request to stay and watch the football game was somewhat unusual, because Red Robin is far from a sports bar. Yet the staff was willing to help us out and make our afternoon really enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=20,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001
12,Megan S.,"Pasco, WA",18,327,37.0,1.0,2012-12-27,"Worst food we have EVER received from a restaurant.  Let me start by saying that my husband and I love Red Robin. We eat there at least once a week in our hometown and we usually have great food and service there. Here, however, the food was simply disgusting. We received food that should have never left the kitchen. I've posted a couple pictures for you to see for yourself, though it was nastier in person I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, wrapped in lettuce, with a side salad instead of fries, and he ordered a bleu ribbon burger, also wrapped in lettuce with a side salad instead of fries (we stay away from carbs). We both ordered ranch with our salads. Our waitress was very nice, but never refilled our drinks even though they sat empty a very long time. The first thing I noticed when our food arrived was that my ranch was quite obviously different in color and texture than my husband's ranch. While his was a normal consistency and color, mine was yellow and thick-- a sign that it was nasty and old. I hate complaining, so I decided to try it on my salad anyway. It tasted off, so I refused to eat any more of it out of fear for food poisoning. Here's where it really got gross. While I'd been dealing with the salad grossness, my husband ate his. When he got to his burger, he noticed the lettuce ""wrapping"" was limp, transparent, and slimy. It looked like the rotten lettuce that's in the bottom of my refrigerator. He took the lettuce off and tried to eat the burger with a fork, but clearly, we'd both lost our appetite.  Furthermore, we asked for our burgers to be well done-- no pink-- and they both arrived with a lot of pink. The kitchen in this restaurant is awful. I wonder if they had a blind man back there working. Who serves rotten lettuce? Who serves two different ranches, one fresh and one obviously not, to a table?  Not to mention, the remodel is uncomfortable (see my Valley RR review) and we were seated about 30 feet from the door and felt a cold draft the whole time. I have NEVER, EVER complained in a restaurant, but out of principle I refuse to pay for such terrible food. When the manager came over, he offered what I believe was more of a justificiation than an apology and told us he'd take my husband's burger off the tab (didn't address my gross ranch, but oh well). He said the lettuce had been ""frozen"" and that he pulled a bunch of frozen lettuce out of the fridge. I have seen frozen lettuce before and it never looked like that. The point is, WHY DID SOMEONE IN YOUR KITCHEN THINK IT WAS OKAY TO SERVE THAT? If it's ""frozen"", travel across the parking lot to Safeway, and pick up some new lettuce (don't serve it anyway!). Is it THAT hard? He never acknowledged that the food we received was not suitable to be served. He never said he'd offer more training to employees; he didn't even say he would talk to the kitchen staff about it.  If the kitchen takes no pride in food preparation (what customers see), I wonder how clean it is back there (where customers don't see). WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=20,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

Wife and I stopped in for lunch the other day while shopping, since we got a gift card here for Christmas. Having been to Red Robin before, we new exactly what we were going to get. Burgers are fine. I always pisses me off that they think I'm too stupid to order my burger anything more complex than ""pink"" or ""no pink"". I actually want my burger medium rare. They won't cook it that way, even if I ask. My ""pink"" burger came out moderately moist, but still definitely overcooked from where I want it. Service was entirely fine.

We had to wait a long time for our waitress to even acknowledge that we sat down in her section. It almost seemed like she was annoyed with us even ordering. After we placed our order it took a very long time to get my husband's milkshake. Our waitress blamed the time on the 'new' bartender and complained how 'slow' she was. When we received our appetizer we did't have napkins  or utensils and had to ask one of the hostess for them. Our waitress never really checked in with us during our meal, she was very quick to bring us more drinks when we didn't need them.

We waited cloae to an 30 minutes for a table. Drink orders taken and promptly filled. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. We were able to take advantage of the free Tavern Double Burger for the Seahawks red zone touchdowns! It was two small, kiddy sized patties, lettuce, tomato, and a slice of cheddar on a small bun. Perfectly sized for me. Our Guacamole Burger was tasty and attractive on its gluten free bun ($1 extra). The Clucks and Fries arrived hot and crispy. Took some effort to catch wait staff for additional ranch dressing dip. I forgot to request a substitute of fresh steamed broccolli and they appeared in 10 minures, cooked fresh to order! I like that they are left plain.   They also appeared to be a bit understaffed as it was difficult to catch our friendly wait person, Tracy, as she bustled from tables to staff station.   Rounded up 3.5 for lack of keeping drinks refilled, the iced tea and strawberry lemonade. The large chocolate shake was equal to two regular ones, very filling! Restrooms were tidy and clean.  Hubby was facing the center of the dining room and found the noise very loud.

I've had a good experience almost every time I've come here. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere, while loud and can be quite loud with children or birthday parties, its usually not to bad that I can't talk amongst my family.  To the food, the real reason why reviews were started, they've been great, my wife loves the Southwest Grilled Chicken salad and I was always a huge fan of the Chili Chili cheeseburger. They changed the idea behind that chili cheeseburger though rather recently, before one would get a plate, burger and bun, topped in chili and required silverware to get it all, now its more of like half a scoop of chili on a cheeseburger. It really takes the oomph out of what was my favorite cheeseburger.  Their menu is great otherwise, many of their other burgers are delicious, my next favorite being the A1 Peppercorn burger.  Overall, its a decent restaurant, somewhere in between a fast-food burger joint and a more traditional sit down restaurant but that is okay, its why I go. Wait time can be a bit long, but never anything crazy.

My issue today was the fact that we didn't even have the chance to eat anything. The place was packed, which isn't their fault, however the attitude of the hostess, who acted as though she was working the door at an exclusive nightclub and not a family friendly burger joint, left much to be desired. She couldn't be bothered, and told us to sit in the bar. We tried, but it's tough to sit in the bar when the only tables open haven't been cleared off. Literally 5 tables in the bar that were waiting to be bussed. She didn't care, so we left.

I sent it back for a new one, and I'm pretty sure I got the exact bowl back, with the cheese a little more crusted and stuck on. The cheese, which my favorite part, was rubbery to the point of it being difficult to chew and swallow. The bread part was soggy and rubbery-how does one even accomplish that?! The onions were burnt in some places-not charred, not carmelized-BURNT. And the broth was scalding! I tried so hard to eat it, because I have been sick and nothing has tasted good to me, but....no.

Each burger is cooked to order and the wait staff are sure to ask you how you want your burger done (pink or no pink). Me, being a little squeamish about pink hamburger, always ask for my burgers cooked all the way through and I have yet to turn away a burger at Red Robin for being under cooked. They have lots of options and sauces, each meal is nicely seasoned and flavored (even their diet menu options) so you should never have a bland meal.  The fries are okay, they are fries. There's nothing that can really be said about fries. They are hot (usually, once they were cold but they were replaced immediately) and they are thick steak fries so you will fill up on them. Watch out.  If you don't like the fries (I'm not a huge fan of RR's fries) they have other options such as steamed broccoli or their freckled fruit salad. The broccoli is steamed to perfection and great for dunking in a sauce. The freckled salad is sweet but not too sweet and has a natural fruity flavor. I'm not sure if they put a syrup on it or if they rely on fruit juice for the salad, but whatever it is, it is really good.  The wait staff is usually really friendly and attentive to your needs and offers empathy and resolution if you just don't like something. I ordered a raspberry creme soda from this establishment once and it was awful, really really awful; it was like drinking cold medicine. I told my waitress and she apologized, took the offending drink away and took the order off our check and offered me a free drink in replacement. A+ service.

1,J D.,"Spokane, WA",6,9,1.0,3.0,2016-04-05,"Tasty burger chain with some new issues (""The Rub"" at the bottom, would have been 4 stars.) The Food - I have to say that I've never been dissatisfied with my burger or other dish, but I do feel that it may be slightly overpriced for ground meat, bun and some sauce...  But yummy! The Experience - The servers do a good job running sodas and the extras.  The kitchen staff brings the food, and if there is an issue, a manager checks it out and then delivers your correction.  I think this ensures a touch of accountability; I like that.  But..... The Rub - I feel that in a sit-down served restaurant, you should not have to ""pay at the cash register"".  Red Robin's new pay at the table shifts the responsibly to fix check issues to you.  We had a group of people out for my wife's birthday and had a free burger card for her meal.  We presented this card at the end meal, the waitress looked at us like we were dumb, asked for the computer thing, played with it for a moment, explained that we are now responsible for this section of our meal and gave it to us to run our own card...  So, now I'm responsible for my check and they default the tip higher than normal???? Frustrated, I downgrade the tip and pay for the meal, which I assumed was correct.  NOPE.  I discovered that night that we had paid full price.  I was supposed to know how to use the burger card, somehow (what was she doing playing with device before degrading us?)  Now we have to go back again for her free burger. Maybe the server just failed the new system, but it made no new fan of me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
22,Jeff R.,"Spokane, WA",113,245,1200.0,5.0,2016-04-11,"I'm not usually a big chain restaurant kind of guy.  However I've made a few exceptions and Red Robin is one of them.   I have found that the wait staff is usually friendly and efficient while the food is consistently very good.  That seems to be especially true at this location.  I like that there are some less expensive items on the menu that are actually a pretty good value (Tavern Double Cheeseburger for $6.99).   I also like that you can get a bottomless side salad instead of bottomless fries.  Desert selection is pretty broad and are always very good. This location does all of the Red Robin attributes well.   Very good food, good selection, and well trained/friendly waitstaff.  Is it a 5 star restaurant?  No.   It gets 5 stars because they deliver exactly what you would hope to expect and then some from a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

But,  was very timely. Clean and spacious. Bathrooms are decent and it is handy cap accessible but very few handy cap parking spots. Inside would be hard to manoeuvre around in a wheel chair.

34,Brian S.,"Dallas, TX",5,28,1.0,2.0,2016-11-12,"I had a great burger! Unfortunately, very rude customer service is what brought my rating way down. The bartender, Chelsea, obviously brings her preconceived notions to work and automatically judges what kind of customer she's gonna have and it's evident in her condescending tone. As another review says, the wait staff is subpar. That is a very accurate statement and I couldn't agree more. So, I'm not even sure why I left Chelsea a tip. I guess people like Chelsea, who hate their lives and take it out on other people, deserve a little mercy regardless of their behavior.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

This team really fumbled.  Didn't hear our name called out after ~15/20 ?? min. long enough for Grandma to finish the kid puzzles so a while... We got the BEST waitress/server/restaurant professional! Smiling, glowing, happy, sparkly...yeah sparkly and ON!  Ya' know...they are rare out there and usually work bars but man...she was awesome.   My grand-kid taught me how to use the online thing so I don't know her name. A shame.   Normally, I would have written about the details of the fumble and suggest they find ways to fix it; but, a truly well done service is worth it's weight in gold.  The food is wonderful but the service supreme.

They have bottomless fries, which means you can refill the fries as many times as you want!!! I ordered bottomless garlic fries for a couple more cents and it was delicious! The meal was really fulfilling, especially after a long time of waiting (about 25 min). The waiter was happy and served us gladly, checking in on us the appropriate amount of time to see if we needed anything. They only downside was when I ordered my shake, they ended up running out of ice cream that was used to create the shakes... overall though, this place was AMAZING!!! It wins my five stars and I will definitely be going back to eat again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

20,David G.,"Colbert, WA",3,6,67.0,4.0,2017-12-04,"Very homey place to sit down and eat a burger with fries. Every time I come heres it's gonna be a burger i'm getting because they always got a new one on the menu to try! I will upload menu pics if I ever see new burgers because that's what their known for! Last time I got the Taco Tavern Double which isn't the thick juicy 1/2 pound patty ones but it was still yummy. Paired with sweet potato fries!! Yes this restaurant is one of the rare place that serves them! I highly recommend them over the steak fries or thick cut normal fries whatever you call them. Very kid friendly food as well, my Niece and Nephew love the pizza , grill cheese, mac and cheese. They also got yummy milk shakes for the kids. Salads are pretty good just make sure you order yours with romaine lettuce only unless you like weeds in yours. They also got options to throw on some cooked chicken etc, More protein . I won't give them 5 stars because sometimes the service is pretty slow to get food ordered or extra napkins and this is not even at peak lunch time or new employees. One time I got both types of fries and they were freezer burnt! Which shocked me and I didn't expect it, must of been old limp fries sitting in freezer too long idk. Anyways wasn't like that after going back recently phew. A helpful tip by the way; if you order food to go don't buy sweet potato fries! Unless you don't mind soggy mushy fries, they will not be crunchy at all. The steam kills them because they are trapped in boxes for too long. Normal fries are fine because they are thicker. Almost forgot to mention you can tell them to double your patty on any hamburger. I do this if I had a light breakfast and need more calories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
