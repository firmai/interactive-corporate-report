John V.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,5,,5.0,1/7/2018,Let me tell you about a great waitress. Me and my family went here to celebrate my moms birthday and where we sat had a lot of screaming children. The waitress (Ally or Allie not sure how to spell her name) relocated us to the other side of the restaurant where it was a lot quieter. Our new waitress was Karen and she was very nice also. Excellent service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville

Ray J.,"Fayetteville, NC",2,4,1,2.0,1/16/2017,"My wife and I frequently go there during our lunch break.  We have always had good, quick service until today.   Our order was placed as soon as we were seated yet it took roughly 35 minutes to get our entrees leaving us five minutes to eat.  This was after checking with several staff members.   The food was just warm and the overall experience was very disappointing considering our previous visits.  Spoke with the manager as we were leaving to let him know that the service was very slow today and his reply was that we should have said something sooner.  Top of his class in customer service skills I see. It will probably be awhile before we return. A quick kudos for the gentleman that runs the bar area...he is excellent.  Did not see him today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville
Reata G.,"Fayetteville, NC",60,13,6,1.0,1/9/2017,"Upon sliding into our booth, my pants caught on a nail or piece of sharp wood sticking out of the cushioned seat... pretty sure there's a welt on the back of my thigh, as I feel the burning already.  Heat is WAY to high, even for the cold natured in our family.  Salsa is watery, we normally LOVE their chips and salsa. We haven't even gotten our lunch yet, but I'm just assume it's not going to be over 2 stars today. Tried to tell the waitress my son needed sweet tea as well, (she saw my aunt needed more and said she'd bring another for her a minute earlier)she said, ""yeah I already said I was bringing more"" ... I was just trying to tell her we needed two refills instead of just the one. Felt really rude.  This is normally our favorite family spot, but today just isn't their day, I guess. Update... that nail put a hole in my pants. Great, now that meal cost me an extra $40.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville
Danny C.,"Cameron, NC",24,2,,3.0,8/9/2017,"I had the sweet chipotle steak. Genius dish, but I asked for medium and got a well done steak.

Peter G.,"Fort Bragg, NC",2,51,37,1.0,2/3/2017,"The family wanted eat at Chili's tonight for a Friday night dinner.  We should have turned around after seeing the parking and trying to find a parking space for 5 minutes.  We all went in sat down and our server came immediately and took our drink order, we were going to get the 3 for $10 menu but the 2 for $22 was much better.  2 of our party got the Fajitas, one got the steak and the other a burger.  Note: Our server did tell us this was his first night.  Our appetizers came out separately, server apologized, they were delicious.  Again, our entrees came out separately, all was well until the person who had the steak saw it was not as ordered, medium, the steak came out blood rare.  We had to wait a bit for the server to come back and told him, even a person who is not a server would have said I will get another one, instead he asked, you want this heated up more, duh, they asked for another steak, didn't want it nuked until done, he took the steak and it took a very long time to replace it, the rest of our party had finished when the steak finally returned, the manager, I assumed asked if everything was ok.  Surprise, when we get the check we get charged twice for steak and an extra side dish.  In closing I think we should have gotten steak for free, since it was messed up and took a long time to get it, our group was a little awkward trying to eat when some did not have food yet and some did, our server never came back to offer more water nor did he offer us desert.  Would you tip ? We did tip, felt bad for server, never should have been put on the hot seat on a very busy night.  Management should've made this right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville

Sierra V.,"Fayetteville, NC",79,1,,1.0,12/24/2016,"Sick, disgusting & awful! I'm so pissed off that my family wasted their time. So many things went wrong but my top two is the fact that I ate raw shrimp that apparently is microwaved. ""They must have been stuck together when they went through our heating machine, they actually aren't sautéed"" says the manager. At the beginning of the visit our waiter told us how she hates when people ask for extra sauce and says to herself when they do, ""owww you mother..."" and then we asked for extra ranch 3 X later on; awkward.

Leah J.,"Fort Bragg, NC",45,86,34,1.0,2/12/2015,"While the service has been great, the food has always been lackluster. They've upgraded their menu with a lot more choices, but these upgraded options leave a lot to be desired. I do applaud their attempt to appear to be a higher quality restaurant, but I just can't take them seriously when I go to take a photo of my dinner, and immediately notice a hair.    Yes, the presentation of the table-prepared guacamole was nice, but my burger (I believe it was a Hawaiian burger or spicy-mango), was virtually flavorless. Of course, I'm referring to the second burger, the first was sent back. I also ordered a toffee brownie which tasted several days old and as if it had been stored next to an onion. I've had gas station ($1) brownies that tasted better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville
Lee B.,"Homestead, FL",34,3,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Rude wait staff more concerned with doing side / closing work than waiting on customers.  The hostess and waitress argued in front of us about getting a table ready.  There were three tables empty already and NO ONE waiting ahead of us.  I don't do rude.  We told the hostess ""never mind"" and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville
Ralph J.,"Fort Bragg, NC",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2016,"If you want to come to a place and freeze your butt off, then look no further.  You'll wait in the restaurant while the waiters take their time bringing you half your order,  while sitting in temperatures equal to the outdoors.  Don't bother trying to alert the management, because they don't care.  Bad experience,  I don't recommend. We waited 30 minutes to be seated (by a hostess throwing menus on the floor and ordering other hostesses to pick them up)....in the tundra. It was literally freezing! All the tables around us had everyone wearing their coats while eating dinner. I mentioned how cold and uncomfortable this was multiple times to 2 different waiters and no improvement!! They said they would speak to the manager to turn the heat up as they claimed it was from the to-go door, however, it was closed almost the whole time we were there and the heat never got better. They moved us to a different table....right next to the original table so again, no improvement in temperature. I had to ask for the manager twice and he stated that he couldn't turn the heat up but stated that he checked it was on. On top of this, they ran out of chips, then there was a delay to get the guacamole to go with the chips once we got them, and then we had to wait another 10 minutes to get the kiosk fixed so we could pay our bill and leave. I have never been more frustrated and unsatisfied. I will not be returning to this restaurant nor ordering from their to-go because of my displeasure with their attitude, atmosphere, and inability to pay their heating bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville
Nikolas Y.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,2,,1.0,10/30/2016,Literally the worst Chilis I have ever been to. I ordered a sweet tea and to my utter dismay I realized upon the first sip it was in fact UNSWEETENED!!!! Sorry I thought this was the south not communist China. Secondly it took well over 9.3 minutes to bring out an order of white queso dip. To put the icing on the cake they ran out of Caesar dressing for their salads.

Despite the fact that I placed my order in advance, when I arrived at the store it still was not ready. I am confused as to why it wasn't because there was only three other people on the entire restaurant. I was not greeted upon entering the restaurant nor was offered a beverage due to the long wait.  Customer service is definitely not their strong suit at this restaurant. My order was not made to my specifications and then they had the nerve to charge me .80 cents for a sour cream.  Also, there were no napkins or utencils in the bag.

I watched you do everything you could to accomodate them. Myself, along with other patrons were convinced that your customer from hell was searching for a free meal. Enjoy your Christmas. Keep your chin up. Don't let crummy people like that ruin your day or holiday.

When I left at 7:30 there were a ton of people waiting. Staff was good. Food was pretty good. I gave it 3 stars because I had to send my salad back, since they messed it up. When I got a new one a chunk from the bottom of the head of lettuce was tossed in. I mean really, is it just me? Does everyone else eat the stump from lettuce.

Wait your the waitress unless your discounting your tip I'm not going to get up from our table for a napkin!!

Sarah K.,"Pembroke, NC",4,94,5,2.0,12/27/2015,"When I have visited this Chili's, the service is hit or miss. I guess it depends on which server you get, some are not attentive at all. The last time I was there, the table next to us had a group that was broadcasting music from their phone very loudly. No one went to their table and asked them to turn it down, or off. I guess you get what you pay for, and since it is a more affordable restaurant, you will have to deal with annoying guests. On the other hand, the food has always been pretty good. The nice thing, is you can pay with card at your table, so if you have a crappy server who barely comes to your table, you can check yourself out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20
Rob C.,"Baltimore, MD",0,18,4,4.0,1/12/2014,Usually this place isn't that bad. Food has always been good and hot and made they way we asked. People are usually nice as well. Only thing that's wrong about this place is server speed. They usually don't come around very often and my kids are sitting waiting for a refill.  Today for some reason the lady that works up front that seats people was very rude today. Her name is lacy and she had a serious attitude. I asked her if I could sit in a certain area and she said yes but got an attitude right away. Then she took us to the wrong place and I said no I wanted this booth over here and she just walked away.

Stacey L.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,6,,1.0,5/14/2014,"Not just the worst experience I've had at Chili's, but the worst experience I've had in any restaurant. WORST customer service ever. This is the first time I've ever been mad enough to actually write a negative review. They have these new tablets on the table. We get there, see a trivia game is going on, looks like some other tables are playing too, cool we'll play. So we play it until dinner comes. When the food arrives, we have four people and a lot of plates so we move the tablet to the empty table behind us. It was like 4 in the afternoon and they were not busy. The waitress seemed irritated that we moved it and put it back on our table, even though we really didn't have room. Felt like we were being rushed. Before we even paid our bill the waitress brings everyone at our table to-go cups of all our drinks, I personally didn't want one and it felt like she was trying to send a message for us to hurry up and leave. There were probably three groups in the whole place besides us, so I don't really understand the rush. Here's the fun part. If you touch that tablet I mentioned, they will charge you for it. It's called a ""table entertainment fee"" and they add it to your bill hoping you won't notice the extra charge. We told our waitress we didn't see any sign saying we would be charged for it and that we felt like she should have told us we would be charged. Her response? It's only a dollar and she agreed that there should be a way to let customers know beforehand but there was nothing she could do about it. Yes, it is only a dollar, but it's the principle of the thing. If people knew you were going to charge they would probably just play on their smartphones that do the same thing. She didn't say I'm sorry, let me get a manager, is there anything I can do for you...nothing. Just, yeah there should be a notice and there's nothing I can do about it. She couldn't get away from the table fast enough and did not come back. Now I see why it was so important to her that the tablet stayed on our table! I made a complaint to someone higher up in the company and got sarcastic responses. That person said there is a notification where you have to agree to the charges before being allowed to play the game. That's funny, why didn't our waitress say anything about this supposed agreement when we complained? No one at our table saw anything like that, and when we complained I would have expected her to say something like ""well you had to agree to the terms and charges before it allowed you to play"". They said next time, I could either enjoy reading USA Today for free on the tablet or have my waitress remove the tablet from the table. That's NOT exactly the response I was expecting to hear from a company customer service rep. I have talked to others who have been charged when their kids played the tablets and they had no idea about the fee. I have also talked to someone who says she has been charged twice and she didn't even use the tablet, just touched it to move it. Besides them being a ripoff, the prolong the payment process. Yes, the waitresses don't even process your payment anymore. You do that yourself. With the tablet. Each person at your table has to swipe their card and do a survey before you can leave...MUCH faster if the waitress would just take them and process them like they would in the past, but we were told they can only do that if we pay with cash now. Won't be back. The food isn't even close to being good enough to make up for the horrible service we received here tonight. There are plenty of restaurants in Fayetteville with better food and MUCH better customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20

Robi G.,"Charlotte, NC",56,13,3,1.0,2/11/2013,"See previous review.  This is a continuation to that visit.... Before going to visit Chili's this particular night, we called ahead to speak to a manager about our previous visit.  Our last experience was a to go order which was completely wrong.  The steaks were over cooked and cold, the sides were wrong, and the fries tasted like they were cooked an hour prior.  The manager that I talked to said that he would put a gift certificate in the mail to compensate our order, since I wasn't able to drive back to the restaurant and get a refund.  I called and explained this situation to the manager, Ian, that night before showing up.  I also told him that I have not received any gift certificates in the mail yet.   He said when we showed up, asked for him and he would take care of things.  We arrived at 5:15 and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  We asked our server, Amanda, if Ian was available, she said that she would go tell him.  We waited about 15 minutes and Amanda came back and said that he was busy, but would come out and talk to us shortly.  We proceeded to order the $35 deal, with the appetizer, entrée and dessert.  The appetizer, a half order of Texas cheese fries, was pitiful.  It was a small cast iron skillet of about 15 French fries with burnt cheese and green onions on them.  We ordered the petite sirloins for the entrée.  They came out surprisingly fast, but once again, with cold and over cooked sides.  The loaded mash potatoes were cold and the broccoli was baby food mush.  I still haven't figured out how they cook steaks.  It seemed that they sear one side, flip it over and barely cook the other side.  Now, I did order a rare steak, but one quarter of is was raw, not rare, there is a difference.  We asked Amanda for another side of hot mashed potatoes, which she got back to us very quickly.  Still no Ian.  We finished our steaks and then came out dessert.  Finished that, still no Ian.  After Amanda's helper bussed our table, we were ready to leave; all we needed was the check.  After about ten more minutes when the check was processed at 6:40, an hour and 25 minutes after we got there, out comes Ian with our check.  He told me that he was sorry about our last experience and that he took off the appetizer and dessert.   I would think that if I called ahead of time and told you about a bad experience from the last time, that you, as a manager would make a special effort to make sure that my next experience would be perfect.  It wasn't.  I emailed Chili's ""customer service"" about my problem and nothing happened.  One, if you are in customer service and don't even bother to respond to a customer about their experience then you aren't doing your job and should be fired.  Two, if you have bad customer service (or zero, for that matter) then what does that say for your company.  Congratulations Chili's, you lost customers because of your so called, ""customer service.""  It doesn't affect you too much anyways because you are a corporate chain and really don't care about two customers and their bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20

Dani M.,"Liberty, MO",8,140,5,2.0,1/10/2013,It's not the worst Chili's ever. But first off let me say I've been there 4 times since living in North Carolina and we've been here for exactly one year. Every time I walk in when they are not busy servers will walk right past us and not seat us. Last time we waited with 3 other couples for about 15 minutes all the while watching servers stand around at the bar talk to each other and watching them walk past us. Today when we went it took about 8 minutes before anyone noticed us. The person who did looked like a manager or someone and she felt awful. Our server was meh she was socially awkward to say the least. Not talkative and kind of blah and boring. No drink recommendations which was ridiculous. If you are a server and you work at Chili's you should be talking about the margaritas there especially if the person is pulling out the margarita menu. They had a new menu and she didn't even tell us about it she just handed it to us and said there is some new stuff. No big deal. I'm like um? Okay don't try to promote your new menu items..... The food is always awesome though. Props to the people who cook. the drinks are pretty decent. The bartender could use some work whoever it is does not know how the right of amounts of liquids....definitely worst margaritas I've had at Chili's.  The servers helper or whatever didn't even introduce himself. He was awkward. And actually the servers stood around at the frotn like a crowd of about 4 of them just standing there. I'm like wow well you have nothing to do but it took you 10 minutes to seat us.  Honestly the food is good but I recommend going to have it to go because you won't be missing anything if you eat there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20

I had my first bad experience at this location a few weeks ago. All I have to say is if you happen to get a server by the name of Wyatt, ask to be seated somewhere else!!! He was the worst server I've ever had! And I'm pretty easy going to begin with. Trust me...MOVE INTO A DIFFERENT SECTION!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20
Teresa R.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2015,"Went to chili's where there was a 15-30 minute wait for our party of 4 and a sling.  40 minutes passed and more than three parties were sat before us that arrived after us.  A party of 4, who came in 20 mins after us, was sat before us, as were two very other large parties.  When we were the last party in the waiting area the hostess asked our names again, then turned and spoke with another hostess saying they had no where to put us, but then sat two more parties, one of three and another of 4.  When we were finally seated we asked why so many went ahead of us and Victoria (the hostess) rudely said ""because of our sling"" and slammed they  menus on the table.  She was very rude and made us feel very unwelcome for having an infant.  It was a terrible experience that I felt compelled to share.  Naturally, we will not return to this Chilis.  They should really think about who they put as the hostesses, Veronica is not someone they want the public to see as a first impression of their restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20
Michelle A.,"Raleigh, NC",19,167,4,3.0,10/12/2012,"Usually have great food here, but today I ordered the garlic parmesan sweet potato fries and they were horrible. Drenched in garlic oil and then just threw on some cheese. Wouldn't recommend them at all. The rest of the food was great and service is always good here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20
Heather P.,"Morrisville, NC",2,23,1,3.0,4/5/2013,"I went here for my birthday one year. It was more funny than anything... At first they brought me the wrong dish, and they didn't have a problem correcting it, they were very nice about it. When they finally brought my dish out, there was a dead bug in it. Not a roach or anything, just a general bug. They were very nice about it (again) and took it back, and I didn't really want anything more so I told them not to worry about it. All in all, I think it was kind of funny.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20
