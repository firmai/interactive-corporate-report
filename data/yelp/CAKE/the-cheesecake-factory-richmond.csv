Maria T.,"Henrico, VA",53,217,538,4.0,12/25/2017,"Top of the food chain restaurant!  This place is so much more than cheesecake.  We got there early when they opened at 10:00am for their Saturday breakfast!  Yes, they've extended their Sunday brunch to include Saturday!  Smart move!  The brunch menu is extensive.  Great choices!  I stuck with the bacon and eggs with blueberry pancakes.  It was all good!!  My friend had the most tremendous omelette, which she raved about!  The tea selection is fabulous too!  I thought the prices were comparable to the quality and quantity of food.   We were seated in the octagon Florida room which I highly recommend.  The main dining area tables can be tight, so a booth is your best bet.  We had plenty of room, had a nice view and it was much quieter in there.  It's also decorated lovely, as is the rest of the restaurant.  The restrooms were clean and fresh. (That's a lot of ""rests"" in one paragraph.) Our server, Katty, greeted us with warmth and enthusiasm.  Super sweet but not overbearing.  A genuine smile to go with her kind personality.  I'd request her section again.   My only critique would be regarding the cutlery and glassware.  The knives were covered in dried food and the glasses were murky and dirty.  Katty quickly apologized and rectified the problem graciously.  She brought back sparkling tableware and we enjoyed the rest of our visit.  This may have simply been a fluke or an oversight in the kitchen, but that accounts for the loss of one star.  However, I will update my review if upon my next visit they clean up their act.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond
Sara M.,"Midlothian, VA",167,176,243,3.0,12/25/2017,I came A week before Christmas on a Monday at 11:30 AM and this place was packed. Thankfully I was able to be seated without a reservation. Service was pretty slow and our waitress didn't check on us very often but I think it's because of how busy they were. Also their menu is huge and it was hard find the lunch specials. I ended up getting the dinner portion of the Alfredo fettuccine with chicken because the lunch option did not come with chicken and it was only six dollars more for the dinner size. I have no idea why a lunch size fettuccine Alfredo with no protein cost almost $14. The noodles ended up being way overdone and there wasn't much chicken. My mom ended up getting a Caesar salad with a margarita pizza and she said it was a great Caesar salad and the pizza was pretty good too.  It then took forever to get our check and boxes and it turned out they just ran out of the big Togo boxes so we had to stuff the pizza in the smallest boxes they had.  We came here because I was given a gift card by my best friend but I don't think I'll be coming back it just wasn't worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond

Tanisha K.,"Henrico, VA",21,61,108,3.0,12/23/2017,"I wish Yelp had a 3 and a half star button because that's what I would give The Cheesecake Factory. I went for lunch with the hubby recently and had a nice time. We were sat very quickly, our waitress was nice and our food came out in timely manner. I was happy because they had lots of vegetarian options for me to choose from but unfortunately they were just okay tasting. My salad actually had what tasted like stale old croutons on it and for some reason I'm always shoo' ing away flies or gnats whenever I visit. I'm sure I'll end up going back there sooner or later but I'm just starting to think that The Cheesecake Factory is starting to feel like a standard chain restaurant but charging high end restaurant prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond

steve k.,"Newport News, VA",37,133,,4.0,12/22/2017,"Was at this restaurant with a large group from work. We were accommodated nicely and felt like our service was very good considering the number of us. Of course, cellphones going off and folks having to leave the table non-stop during the meal takes away from the experience. However, lunch was great. My Shepherds Pie was excellent and very filling. We did have cheesecake (why not?), and while good not as good as I may have expected (once you got past the caramel topping and whipped cream the cake was frozen, which I suspect is not that unusual but took something off the experience). Ironically, most of the folks I was with said the same thing when comparing the actual meal and desert, which is an interesting comment. For the record, nobody left overly unhappy and we should have taken a walk before going back to the office (since at about 2pm severe sleepy-ness set in). Now If I were at Short Pump and wanted a nice meal I would certainly stop in...and maybe try the cheese cake again too but get some coffee to complete the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond

We were a group of 11 so out wait time was lil more than an hour. We were seated in a nice area and we were truly enjoying being in the back of the restaurant.

Ferris-Venis H.,"Novi, MI",38,32,7,1.0,12/1/2017,"I have been to many cheesecake factories all over the country and I have never had bad service But this was the absolute worst restaurant I have ever been to.  The food was cold & we had to send back our mashed potatoes twice before they came out warm.  The service was terrible! So we decided to take her cheesecake home so I asked the waitress for an extra serving of raspberry sauce to go with my original cheesecake and she said no problem.  Apparently she forgot to put it in the bag which i realized before we left.  So I walked up to the cheesecake counter and asked the servers working behind the counter for an extra raspberry sauce.  I was appalled by their answer in which they told me I had to go back to my server to request an extra side.  Which I thought was ridiculous because they could have just handed it to me.  It's a tiny cup of raspberry sauce for god sake!   Instead I decided to walk up to the manager to tell him that they were rude and didn't want to help me and that our service was terrible to begin with.   Well that didn't help because apparently Rodney doesn't care about his customers.  The manager, Rodney proceeds to tell us ""we need to charge you for that"".  Are you freaking kidding me after I just spent $150 on dinner you're gonna charge me for a side of raspberry sauce to go with my cheesecake????  I was very upset about that!   it wasn't about the money but you're going to nickel and dime a customer for a tiny container of raspberry sauce????   are you that desperate cheesecake factory????  The worst part is he didn't do anything about it.  My husband and I left without the raspberry sauce to go with our cheesecake that we took home.  Rodney the so called ""manager"" could have cared less he didn't try to rectify the situation or anything  Which then tells me why the restaurant wasn't busy at all, why we had terrible service, & why the food was cold. Because if they have a manager that doesn't care about his customers then obviously he doesn't care about his job or anything else that's going on in the restaurant!!!!

We had excellent service and the food tasted amazing. There was no wait (I am assuming this is because we came around 11:30). I ordered the Santa Fe Salad (this is one of my favorite dishes here) and it was PERFECT. It tasted great and was a big enough portion for two. I ended up taking about half of my salad home. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and informed us of the daily specials. She was quick to refill our drinks and checked in on us every now and then.

Muhammad R.,"Glen Allen, VA",68,86,60,2.0,1/14/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory a handful of times in a few different cities. I think it's a pretty safe, stable, less-than-adventurous type of place to eat at.  Without a doubt, it's popularity is something that obviously means it's good, but it isn't for everyone. I spend some time at home trying new things and cooking for myself and my wife. That being said, with the right ingredients, I could probably successfully attempt everything and anything on their menu.  During this particular dining session at TCF, I ordered the Chicken Madeira with a side of mashed potatoes. The dish was delicious but it didn't wow me. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were a nice texture. The sauce was sweet and savory, but again, nothing to leave me craving more at the end. I paid almost $20 for it so I expected it to be $20/plate good.  My cousin had the fish and chips and my mom and dad had some shrimp pasta that looked okay. All parties stated their meal was enjoyable and they ate their fill. For someone very picky or not adventurous in the flavor department, the TCF menu is beyond satisfactory.  The service at TCF is always pretty decent. Although this time, we sat near the kitchen exit and I think no less than 20 plates were broken during our dining session. Every few minutes it was glass breaking!! You could probably lower the prices if the wait staff was more careful with the dishes. Also it didn't help that a server dumped her drink tray right next to our table and decided to douse my cowboy boots in water. :-/ no bueno. Didn't make a big deal out of it because she seemed to be having a rough day.  Oh well. TCF leaves more to be desired and I want to write a 5* review for it but it just doesn't earn in. I'm sure I'll meander into another one in a few years, but it's definitely not a ""Go-to"" type of place for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=20

Margaret M.,"Kutztown, PA",0,6,,1.0,11/2/2017,We were a party of 12 so they said it would be 1.5 hours wait time. We were ok with that since it was a nice night out. We waited outside on some benches. An hour and a half came and went. They just kept seating people who had smaller parties even though they came after us. Finally around 8:30pm a table for 6 came available so we had the teens sit so they could order. They had to swim early in the morning so we just wanted them to eat already. The table right next to it opened shortly after that but they wouldn't let the parents sit there claiming that they were holding it for someone else. But what about us?

David K.,"Sandy Hook, VA",0,14,,1.0,12/9/2017,"When this place first opened I would have given them 5 stars. After years of going here this place has gone down the tube. Tonight was the last straw. Being the holidays I understand the place is overwhelmed and mistakes can happen. With that said let me begin the end of cheesecake for us. We came in tonight with low expectations, within 20 minutes we had our table squeezed right in with other diners, when I say squeezed we hit elbows every second with the staff. Our waiter comes over and grabs my shoulder to tell me he will be right with us, why did he grab my shoulder? Not a germ-a-phobe, but still weird. Next I was paying attention to everyone around while we waited for our waiter to comeback to take our drink order. You could easily hear everyone's conversation, so you would think people wouldn't be talking about such personal topics, but people did. Just a very uncomfortable situation, not romantic at all. Finally we get our drink orders in and then our entree. Had to skip the Mac and cheese balls that used to be sooooo goooood, now they taste like a big ball of grease. Found that out last time. So my wife's food comes out, she got the Shepard Pie, which was horrible, they didn't cook the vegetables in the pie so everything was creamy warm and soft mixed with hard frozen carrots. But my food didn't come. Didn't think it was weird because one the people beside us didn't receive their food with the rest of her group. She got her plate about 10 minutes later. So after about 2 minutes of waiting our waiter came back to tell me he forgot to put my order in and it will be up real quick. What!?! You forgot to put my order in? How hard is your job? Anyways I don't want to mean. Then after 7 minutes of waiting, watching my wife pick through her food, a manager comes and tells me how upset she was and that my food would be right up. My level of frustration is about a 7 at this time. 15 minutes in and out waiter returns to tell me my food should be out any minute, frustration level now a 10. Told him to forget about it, wrap my wife's food up and send me a check. He says no problem and he will take my entree off the bill and someone will still bring it to me in a to go box. You damn right you're taking it off my check and no I don't want it anymore. Another 6 minutes go buy to get the check paid and I gave the crappy waiter a small tip anyways, because that's the kind of person I am. Started to head out when another manager comes up and hands me my entree I took it and placed it on the floor and my wife left her food too and we headed out the door never to comeback. We have ate here what feels like 50 times since it opened, always leave 25-30 percent tips, even when the service was bad or the food was nasty. Tonight was the last straw. I highly recommend no one to come here. It's not date friendly nor family friendly. I don't even know if they know what they are with 2 big screen tvs playing sports at the bar that the whole restaurant can see in their weird Roman theme paint job. Would give them negative stars if I could. Please stay away from them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=20

Tammy D.,"Mechanicsville, VA",265,27,26,2.0,6/22/2017,"If the theme of the night was...waiting...over...and...over, then the moto was: No extra efforts wasted on them! Do not get me wrong, I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory CHEESECAKE!  Yet, when our son and his wife and children tried to take us out for a Mother's Day/Father's Day Dinner, the overall experience was horrible.   #1 - We were told 20 minutes to wait, given a buzzer, and proceeded to wait for nearly an hour! When my daughter-in-law went up to the desk and asked how much longer, she was informed that we had been called already (mind you we were only about 6 ft away from the desk and clearly visible)!  She, of course, informed them that it did not go off. At which time he said, 'yes, we know, there is a technical issue'.  - Wait - What? - So you knew the buzzer did not work, AND you saw us standing, only a few feet from you...and you did not bother to step out and let us know, OK, maybe you didn't want to move from behind the desk, so, you could not even just call our name out?  No..they gave our table away!  He assured her we would get the next open table (Again...what kept you from calling out our name in order to get our table?)! #2 - Once we were FINALLY seated (in a booth - which is a problem, b/c I am disabled from MS and it is difficult for me to 'slide' in place - when asked about it and to get a regular table, they said they did not have any; yet were cleaning off tables across from us).  The waiter did not even get around to our table for nearly 10+ minutes.  Once he did, it was for a quick 'hello' & 'be right with you'.  We had to stop him & ask if we could get drinks?  It did not get better from there. #3 - From that point on, it was not much better. It seems the theme of the night was...waiting...over...and...over! We had to wait too long for food, too long to ask for napkins, too long for refills...you see where I am going with this.  #4 - In regard to the food, I will simply say, my son was in the bathroom before we left.  My giant cobb salad was mostly a heap of iceberg lettuce, with shaved chicken here and there along with shaved hard boiled egg on the edge of bowl - not at all worth the money, let alone eating.   #5 - The one saving grace we looked forward to was what everyone ultimately comes there for - the cheesecake!  We were so ready to go that we order them to go (taking nearly 15+ min).  When we stepped outside to say our goodbyes and go our separate ways, I went to divvy up the cheesecakes to the right person, it was suddenly clear that one was missing.  In I marched to the desk and told the girl that I was missing a cheesecake. She asked who my server was, as I gave description she knew and the disappeared to find him.  I did not tell what type I was missing. Our of the kitchen door our waiter appears, headed straight in my direction, I start to say something and he cuts me off and says, 'You are missing a red velvet cheesecake, right?' If he knew without anyone telling him, means he knew before we left and we were only steps right outside of their door - he could have simply looked out the door even.  No extra efforts wasted on them seems to be the moto! I was very disappointed from the front door, to our seating, wait staff, food and the finale of  the lack of concern!  Save your money and order the cheesecake online...it will save you frustrations, time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=20

Unfortunately it wasn't so. We ordered our apps and meals at the same time. Apps came out in great time, unfortunately the entree came out when we needed to leave and come back to work. So we weren't able to enjoy it there in house. We were there for roughly an hour and 15 minutes, and ordered our food within 10-15 minutes of being seated. The service from the staff was extraordinary. They were polite, and we never had our beverage empty. The food was mediocre, i know i can come here for a satisfactory meal.

Marissa B.,"Richmond, VA",104,92,143,3.0,7/2/2016,"A solid 3 stars. Nothing super spectacular, but nothing too terrible. It's a nice place to have either a casual or semi-fancy dinner. Service is hit or miss; the servers are usually nice, but they seem to disappear for a long time or not refill drinks, as was my experience tonight with the bf's family.  The menu is huge and literally has anything you can think of, both picky eaters and those with an adventurous palette will not be disappointed. I usually go for the teriyaki chicken or some pasta dish [where the portions are huge], but tonight I tried the seared tuna tataki salad. It seemed enticing, the flavor combinations sounded great [rare ahi tuna, avocado, mixed greens tossed in wasabi vinaigrette], but it was not worth the $19 price tag. For that price, you would expect a large portion of tuna, more variety of veggies, something out of this world. I'm sad to say that this dish didn't particularly deliver, unlike other offerings I've had in the past. The salad was also not very filling; if it weren't for the super delicious complementary brown bread, I wouldn't have been full. Again, the salad itself was prepared nice, lightly dressed, and delicious, but not worth the high price tag. You can get an order of tuna tartare from the appetizer menu for the same amount of tuna, but for $10 or so. I would personally stick with the desserts [the vanilla bean cheesecake is my all time favorite], they definitely do cheesecake well. The appetizers/small plates are always affordable and tasty, and the ""specialties"", burgers, pastas, and other entrees are where you'll get the best value for your dollar. All in all, a decent restaurant; I'm sure I'll be back to try something else from their gargantuan menu, just not super soon, haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=20

Both servers were pleasant, patient with me in my zombie mindset after an 11 hour shift, and so fast and caring. Rodney deserves a raise.

Wait was not too long even though I was surprised there even was one for a late lunch. Our sever had several tables going so he was very busy and it showed in his short and quick responses. So of course, there were a couple of mishaps, but the waiter quickly fixed them. I was not thrilled with my steak tacos, the presentation was nice, but there was hardly any steak in them and the rice had a creole seasoning that I did not like at all. My husband's salad was huge, but we have had better salads at other restaurants. My favorite thing was the guacamole, but it had no salt at all so we had to add it. So in summary, for the price, we rather eat elsewhere where we can enjoy our food more and for better value.

Anony M.,"Richmond, VA",0,18,,1.0,8/7/2016,"I think Cheesecake factory relies on the premise of everyone assuming this is where rich white people go to eat. It's ""fancy"" and you can get whatever you want because the menu is 20 pages long. Have you ever heard the phrase ""jack of all trades, master of none?"". That's cheesecake factory except they are the jack of nothing but garbage food and tasteless interior decorating. I've given them a fair shake. I think I've been dragged to this location 3-4 times. Maybe more, but if I did go I blocked them out of my memory.  Before you're seated you pray to your god of choice that you will get an actual booth, and not be situated 6 inches away from the table next to you. If that fails, you pray that you will not be put next to a baby. I know there is no loving god because almost every time I've gone neither of these prayers have been answered. To be fair I don't think they deliberately put me next to a screaming child every time I go in, but considering they're trying to pack as many people under one roof as they can it's almost impossible not to be surrounded by babies. There is next to no privacy here (or at any Cheesecake Factory since they all seem to do this.). You will be given a copy of war and peace and told your server will be right with you. 40 servers will run past your table. None of them will look at you. You will wait, and wait, and wait. Suddenly someone shows up to take your drink order and promptly disappears again never to return.  Where do they go? I cannot say that I know. Must be pretty rad quitting your job at Cheesecake factory so that you can put ""i travel between dimensions and materialize from the aether at will"" on your resume.  They actually could leave for 100 years and you wouldn't have enough time to decide what to get because of the size of the menu. I get that they're trying to offer something for everyone, but restaurants are not good at this. Quick question for anyone giving Cheesecake factory more than one star: What are they known for making? Anyone? Hello? What's their famous dish other than Cheesecake? Nobody knows, or they're all sword to secrecy.  Someone will bring you bread, but only after you flag a server down and go ""Hey can you get my server? I think their name was Chris/Ashley/Jennifer/Dan/Greg/etc"" They will say ""Nobody with that name works here. Have bread."" The bread is okay though. They can make edible bread. +1 Cheesecake factory.  After you've ordered and waited months and years and eons and infinity, your food will come and you will be disappointed. I want to point to one dish that stands out as being especially mediocre, or over the top terrible. I can't though. It's all shit. Just ask for more bread. Some of this post is exaggerated just a tiny bit for effect but I actually had to ask for more bread because the food was so bad I couldn't bother eating it. I ordered a club sandwich that day which is probably the easiest sandwich in the world to not screw up. If you somehow aren't disappointed then your taste buds are shot and you should never recommend restaurants to anyone. Your opinion cannot be trusted. If someone says ""Hey where is a good place to eat"" Just say ""Sorry I'm not allowed to tell you. Some guy on yelp said so.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=40

Ashley R.,"Richmond, VA",5,36,2,2.0,7/17/2016,"This is my second time at Cheesecake Factory and I just can't for the life of me understand why people wait and wait for such mediocre food. The first time I went was a decent experience, but the food was just okay nothing great. This time, the entire experience was bad. We arrived around 6:15 on a Saturday and my sister put our party of 8 down and was told she couldn't be quoted a time because of the size of our party, the manager would have to do it. The manager quoted her an hour and a half... Ridiculous, but as to be expected. We were okay with that. After an hour, a member of our party went to check the status and was told it would be about 20 more minutes (sounds about right). We waited the 20 minutes and another member of our party went to check, and was told by the manager we had another hour wait. About 15 minutes later the hostess comes out looking for 2 parties to be seated, and jokingly a member of our party asked if she was looking for our party of 8... She said, ""No, but I can check... Wait. A party of 8? It might be a while..."" So she comes back out and tells us that we were quoted 2-3 hours, and we've ONLY been waiting an hour, but it'll be about 20 more minutes"". Now we're getting upset because we were quoted 1 1/2 hours, not 2-3 hours. No way we would've stuck around for potentially 3 hours waiting to eat mediocre food. So again, we wait, my uncle goes up to talk to the hostess and tells her that we were quoted 1 1/2 hours, she says, ""I'm sorry but the computer says something different"". So he goes to talk to a manager, the manager says he didn't tell her 1 1/2 hrs, so my uncle calls my sister up and the manager says he didn't remember speaking to her and he quoted all large parties 2-3 hours that night. My uncle and his gf continue to talk to the manager and eventually end up getting us seated... Separately. They were sat at a 2 person table, a couple was between us, and then the rest of us were at a 6 person table. They said they would move us together once the couple in between left, but by the time they cleared the table (15 minutes after the couple left) they had their food and it was no point in moving. It doesn't get better... When our waitress arrives (very quickly, surprisingly), she asks how everyone is. My dad, who isn't a complainer at all, started to say ""eh, could be better"", but she talks over him and cuts him off and starts asking for drink orders. She asks if we want appetizers and to put in the order for my 3 year old niece. Thanks for being quick and thoughtful, but we literally had been sitting for 2-3 minutes, with no time to look at the menu. We really felt rushed. She comes back with the drinks and just holds them out, doesn't say anything when we don't notice she's there. Just stood there waiting. She then took our orders. The food came out about 15 minutes later, I order the teriyaki chicken and baked potato soup. I don't know how the baked potato soup tastes because it never came out. The teriyaki chicken was VERY bland. I tried to fix it with salt and pepper, unfortunately both salt dispensers were damp in the inside so the salt wouldn't come out, I learned that when I opened the top and all the damp salt fell in my plate. Another waitress came around and offered to refill our drinks, and my dad asked (very politely, I might add) for more bread, she was very short with him and said ""hold on, sir!"" in a frustrated tone. Surprise, surprise... The bread never came. By this time I'm very irritated, I waited 3 hours for food that wasn't good and received terrible service in the process.  I ordered an Oreo milkshake to go which was good. And now I'm writing this review, very disappointed. The complimentary bread is good, only the brown bread, the white bread will chip your teeth. This was just an all around bad experience... And I don't even like cheesecake! Throughout this process we saw people come, eat, and leave all while we were still waiting outside. A group of 8 isn't even THAT big of a group. Anyway, in summary... Be prepared to wait, don't have too high expectations for the food or service, and expect to overpay for everything.  Oh another plus... The bar made lemonades are free refills.  I don't think I'll be going back to The Cheesecake Factory, there's nothing driving me to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=40

I was in Virginia for a work trip and saw the Cheesecake Factory as we drove by and mentioned to my colleagues that I would like to stop in one day while we're here. 1) Service: I was very unhappy with the way the server described every item on the menu identically ""it's a good portion, flavourful and my favourite""  2) Etiquette: I thought bringing around of waters for everyone was common courtesy. I asked for water with my drink and I was the only one who got a glass 3) food: like I mentioned - I remember the food being decent - but I really didn't enjoy it.

My daughter and I tried to talk the server into asking the chef to make it cedar smoked but she wasnt budging...told us to try the blackened instead and it was good..not as good as the smoky cedar but good nonetheless. The salmon comes with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. The broccoli was a little boring.. it could use a sprinkle or two of some seasoning or butter..but if your trying to be healthy its perfect. The mashed potatoes were super chunky but delicious, clearly handmade. You cant really mess up the taste of a potato though can you??

Michelle W.,"Richmond, VA",78,55,36,2.0,3/29/2016,"This place was hit or miss for me. I went in with a friend on a Saturday night with no reservation and ended up only having to wait 30 minutes for a table for two, which was a miracle considering how many people were waiting. We saw people turn away just after us when they were quoted an hour or more for three or more people. In the essence of full disclosure, I know that it's pretty much mandatory to make a reservation for this place because I've been to the one in Virginia Beach which has 3 hour waits on a Saturday night. We just got lucky I suppose. Anyway, the atmosphere is pretty bustling and we were seated and greeted pretty quickly. Our waitress was pleasant and helpful, even kidding with us that the menu is like a small novel. This is where the problems with this place start. When people are offered so many options, it is hard to make a decision on just one thing. The menu is probably 20 pages, which is excessive to put it politely. They also change the menu twice a year, so it only adds to the confusion for consumers. I ended up with a crispy chicken costoletto, or in better terms, breaded chicken with asparagus and potatoes. Definitely not worth the very high price tag of $18... The cheesecake I ordered to go was delicious but very rich. I ended up only eating half before tossing the rest. They also don't have any prices on the menu for their drinks or wine, which should be a red flag to customers that they are overpriced!  I think if you're just looking for dessert to share, it's a good idea to order for pickup and take it home, but the dinner fare here isn't anything to write home about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=60
Mike B.,"Chesterfield Court House, VA",13,396,,4.0,7/14/2015,"Not typically a big fan of chain restaurants, but we had some gift cards given to us about a year ago, and finally decided to wade through the endless line waiting to get into Cheesecake. I'm glad we did. We went for a late lunch, but I don't think it matters when you go.....you're going to wait. We had the loaded tater tots for an appetizer, which were awesome. I had the classic burger, and my wife the baja chicken tacos. We both liked out meals very much, and it's a TON of food. To the point that there was no way we were going to order cheesecake.  Here's an idea for Cheesecake: put a scoreboard type sign on the outside of your building somewhere, and show the current average wait time. There are ALWAYS people sitting around outside your front doors waiting for their number to come up, and I would bet most people like me just drive on by, assuming that the wait is in the range of 1 hr. But if the ""scoreboard"" said the average wait was 15, 20 minutes or whatever, I would be inclined to swing in and eat.

The server apologized and took the sandwich back (he handled it very well) a few min late the manager arrived and apologized offering a soup while I waited.  Once the sandwich arrived again I was off put by it still being the same piece of chicken and the exact same fixings (I had gotten avocado on the top of the bread before they took the sandwich back)  which just had the raw chicken on it   I was given a complementary cheesecake slice but I feel like this situation could have been handled better just by simply using new fixings.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=80
Lamar J.,"Richmond, VA",32,7,18,4.0,8/16/2014,"Initially, my plans for yelp were to only review small, lesser-known, mom-and-pop establishments. Clearly, chains would not make this list. However, since myself and a friend have been on a happy-hour kick, I had to add Cheesecake Factory to the list. Here's why: Pros: Options and affordability are the driving factors that can make or break a place as a happy-hour haven. Their menu has three pages that include 40 (yes....40!!!) appetizer/small plate options. Have your typical burger sliders, or you can live a little and indulge in chicken samosas (they're great if you like curry). Salads also make the cut for those who want them, but a salad is the last thing on my mind after a day's work.  As far as drinks, there are a few cocktails (do a long beach iced tea if you can handle it) along with select wines, beer, and well-drink options which are typical for a happy hour. The icing on the cake for this place is that EVERY SINGLE OPTION on the menu is LESS THAN $7!!!!! (Imagine that I'm yelling this in a field of wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men and a cloud of confetti).  The cons: Happy hour is restricted to the bar area. So, you have to get there early on more popular days, and you can't enjoy your drinks outside.  The only location for RVA is in the west end- Traffic is generally unbearable and the crowd may be a little too ""buttoned-up"" if you're looking for a place with flair.  If the short list of cons doesn't deter you, it shouldn't, stop by between 4 to 6 Monday through Friday and enjoy!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=80

It was coffee.  Finally coffee arrived via a runner. (As is typical at Cheesecake Factory) but no creamer and we had ordered creamer w our coffee order.  Still waited for creamer as our coffee got less and less warm.   Finally my sister went into bar and got cream from bartender.   Still no Joey..... As he had said, I'll be right out.   Finally placed food order. But other couple who came in and ordered AFTER us, got their food before we did.   The only thing that mellowed me out and stopped me from verbally shredding them to bits was the fact I had 2 mimosas by the end of my meal.   My sister had to ask for grape jelly twice.  She was given strawberry jelly. I just don't know how much more they could screw up the service or my impression.  But then our food arrived. Her omelet was rubbery and had minimal filling.  No salt or pepper on tables.   Earlier Joey the Mgr, said he would come ck on us again.  We were waiting to tell him of the epic fail in service and quality.  HE NEVER RETURNED even though HE SAID HE WOULD!!!! We finally asked for him to return.  Explained politely our disappointing experience and asked him to take off the charge for my sisters omelet.  He did.   This was the absolutely worst experience at CCF ever.  I will NEVER go to this one again.  I encourage all who read this to go anyplace else.  There are lots of options at short pump.

But being a vegetarian, she requested to hold the chicken. She asked whether it would be possible to add a few more vegetables as a replacement to chicken, and the waitress said yes. After the kids went to bed, we lit up some candles and sat down at the table to have a romantic birthday dinner. But alas, the pasta dish that my wife ordered had bacon in it. A lots of it! She gets repelled by meat, and just couldn't eat any of it.  This, in spite of our clear instructions to the waitress about her being a vegetarian. Overall, we like the place.

Jo M.,"Boston, MA",13,104,18,3.0,4/22/2015,"So it's a Cheesecake Factory. If you've been to one, you've been to them all, and this location is no different. I've gotten take out a couple of times, and it's always been quite good. They're really good about making sure my dishes are hot (like straight out of the oven hot) so that they're not cold by the time I make it to the hotel. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was a treat, and they even made me an entrée sized mac and cheese when I was craving one. I usually grab a drink at the bar while I'm waiting for my food, and this is where they fall down a little. The bartenders are not nearly as attentive as I would have expected. I can understand that they're making drinks for the entire restaurant, but on my last trip I sat at an empty bar, in a near empty restaurant for 5 minutes before the bartender stopped chatting to a waitress and offered to get me a drink. Not happy.  Overall, it's a decent place to eat. Just be prepared for giant helpings!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=100

They don't bring the bread out you have to ask whoever walks by for it because your server is MIA ... The whole time by the way.  The appetizer and appetizer plates stayed on the table the whole time.  Never offered to fill up water or remove any of the plates.  Server was MIA so never once came to ask how everything was.  They used to box up your food for you now you do it yourself.  Like I said real casual.   I always order the bistro shrimp pasta in which they used to offer freshly grated cheese to go on top now apparently you have to request it.   So if this is your first time I guess you won't even know they offer freshly grated cheese.   And the restaurant was freezing!!! It was not cold but super uncomfortably c o l d the entire time.   And I'm not a cold person like that usually.   The food was still good but the service was pretty crappy for Cheesecake Factory.   So this is more against the server, service and management and not the restaurant.   However they represent Cheesecake Factory.  I hope this was a one time thing and hope for a better experience next time.   There's better service at the Waffle House on Jeff Davis than this and that's ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=100

There is an amazing outdoor mall right beside the restaurant so that makes the wait time less stressful. We did some walking around and then decided to hang near the bar for a bit. I will admit that the bar was super packed but I got all the help that I needed from not only the bar tenders but also the waiters as well. Like I said before, it's a well known restaurant on a Saturday night. When we finally got seated our waitress, Abby was very helpful and attentive. The food is actually fairly priced and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was out of this world!! I wound give 10 stars to the food alone. Of course you have to finish with a cheesecake duh!

But their Home Made meatloaf and Cobb salad are great as well. Oh and the Cheesecake is wonderful..but by the time the food is all gone, it's easy to forget that is an option!

Ryan M.,"Midlothian, VA",97,121,5,1.0,9/20/2013,"Not a fan.   Perhaps I should come here exclusively for the desserts, but I'm not even that crazy about desserts.  Why do people go crazy over this place with the price tags these dishes have?   And why does their menu have to be 20 pages long, with FULL page advertisements in them.  Am I opening a ValuPak or am I opening a restaurant menu?  Come on. Tried the pot stickers, which were flavorful and moist as they should be, but the dish was totally killed by the oil it was floating in.  Definitely unnecessary, and salted the entire thing far too much.  Shame, because they could have saved face with a 2 star rating instead of a 1.  Because my opinion matters, or something. Went with their Carbonara pasta, and opted to have the spaghettini replaced with penne.  I think that substitute was a good move, but the entire dish was totally off kilter.  The sauce was the consistency of water.  The ""sauce"" was STARTING to get the flavor to where it should have been, but just fell short.

Christopher C.,"Chester, VA",12,9,2,1.0,10/8/2013,"My wife had a $50 gift card to The Cheescake Factory, so we decided to eat there on one our rare nights out without the kids. We arrived at about 7:30pm on a Friday and the first thing I noticed was that it was loud.  The place is built like a big box and it seemed like everyone was yelling to be heard over everyone else.   I asked if we could be seated outside, but the waitress said since there were thunderstorms in the area that the outside patio had been closed and it wasn't possible.  So she lead our party of 2 through the restaurant, and I saw where she was leading us and started to pray that we weren't going to be seated where I thought she was going to seat us.  If you've ever seen speed dating on television, you've probably seen the small tables for 2 that we were led to.  This table wasn't against the wall but in the middle of a row of about 12-15 of these tables.   When we sat down I could better hear (and probably touch) the guys to either side of me than I could my wife across the table.  Then I heard kids crying, people yelling, and a goat bleating (not really) and hollered to my wife that our ""date nights"" are too rare to get hoarse trying to hold a conversation and that I wanted to leave. We left and ate at Capitol Ale House further east on Broad Street at Innsbrook.   I'll update my review one day when we go at an off-peak hour to use up that gift card.

Our waitress was very attentive and always seemed to be around to refresh drink, but was not overbearing at all and was very professional.   The food was also much better than I expected.  We ordered calamari as an appetizer and were impressed.  It certainly was not the best calamari I have ever had, but it had good texture and flavor, and I would definitely recommend it.  The couple we were with ordered the spinach dip which they said was definitely below average, it was basically boiled spinach with little shredded cheese thrown on top. Our entrees were all VERY large(which I think is a plus), and came out very quickly.  We had the Louisiana chicken pasta, the tomato basil penne, Cajun style catfish, and the fried shrimp, all of which exceeded our expectations. Of course we finished off with cheesecake.  The vanilla bean cheesecake was fantastic, as was the oreo.  Both are a tad pricey(as expected) but the large portion sizes made up for it.

But every visit to the restaurant is disappointing, to the point of we just try it once a year. This year's visit was just depressing. We arrived for a late lunch on a weekday. The restaurant was maybe 25% full. The hostess tries to squeeze us into a two-top next to a large party with very young children. I ask politely if we can have a table with more space. Huge sigh and eye roll from hostess and she does not even speak, just flounces off with the menus. We follow hoping she is in fact re-seating us. We are seated at a more appropriate table. From there the service is fine, but we are struck by the fact that NO ONE SMILED at us the entire time we were there. Not the hostess, not the waiter, not the food runners-NO ONE. It was just odd. No one was outright rude, and the food came promptly, which we were certainly appreciative of, but it kind of freaked us out that not one employee seemed happy to be working there.

The unrealistic portion sizes are supposed to compensate for the prices, I guess, but it's really wasting food unless you want to eat leftovers at home the next day.  We had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and what was described as succotash. My meatloaf had a stack of cooked stringy onions on the top, while my companion's had both onions and mushrooms. The meat was overly spicy, a bit too much pepper, and was slightly on the dry side, no gravy or sauce included. The mashed potatoes were redskin and included a lot of lumps, tasted fine though. The ""succotash"" wasn't really what we Southerners define as succotash, i.e. corn and lima beans, often with tomatoes. It was grilled corn, sweet peppers, onions and, again, something very spicy added. It was good, just not succotash.  The restaurant was virtually empty at 2:30 pm on a Friday. The service was very good, except the oddity of my companion's water glass being refilled while my tea glass sat there half-filled. In an hour and a half, the tea glass was never refilled....and at $2.95 for it, that was not good. Add to that the tea being VERY weak and tasteless, and this restaurant lost another star.   We had no cheesecake.

I have ate at other CF's and had amazing desserts, but this was horrible. I will most likely never go back to one after this.

We had a $50 gift card and no intention of heading back over here any time soon. Ordered the Buffalo Blasts and they were delicious. Chicken, cheese, and buffalo sauce friend and served with blue cheese dressing. They were crispy, slightly spicy, and the chicken was tender. Also got the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, which I would probably skip. Although the veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, carrots) were fresh, the shrimp and rice paper just didn't do it for me. Got the shepherd's pie as well, which was a ton of beef, veggies (mushrooms, carrots, peas, onions) drenched in sauce and topped with a mashed potatoes that had a thin cheese crust over top of them. Not my thing, but it wasn't bad. And the serving was huge. Got the fried shrimp platter, too. Cole slaw was too mayo-y, but the shrimp were large and tasted good. Fries were fries. We were way too full for dessert, even to take home. But trust me when I say you probably won't regret ordering dessert. Their selection of cheesecakes is huge.

My sister, husband and I went out for a celebration tonight and left feeling frustrated and disrespected. Our waitress was sweet and attentive, and deserves a 5 star raving review. Unfortunately, my sister's meal came out and it was inedible and tasted like eating straight balsamic vinegar. We asked the waitress about it and she agreed that it didn't smell or look correct, and made the situation right by bringing out a completely different dish. She also commented that she spoke to the manager and the manager would comp her meal, which we expected to mean that my sister's portion of the bill would be taken off. Then when we got the bill we were charged for her meal. They ""comped"" her meal she sent back (which is not a comp-- of course she shouldn't have to pay for a meal that was sent back) and charged us for her replacement meal. I politely asked to speak with the manager, thinking surely something was typed incorrectly on our receipts. Normally this isn't something I would do, but I truly thought that there may have been a mistake on the bill. Instead of listening respectfully and trying to understand our situation, the manager was incredibly rude and demeaning and made us feel stupid for thinking our meal would be comped. He immediately said ""why would I comp that meal?"" in a sarcastic and mean tone, then after asking why my sister didn't like the meal, coldly said ""that's how the meal was supposed to taste, sorry you didn't like it. We comped the meal you sent back and got you a new one."" After this argument continued going back and forth with continued rudeness on his end, I finally said to forget it, apparently we didn't understand each other. All he said was ""great"" and walked away. He saw my frustration and was fine with leaving the situation dealt with in this poor manner, with a completely dissatisfied customer.

I'm kind of a pain at restaurants because I can't eat gluten but there are lots of GF options here, and I overheard the manager answering a question at a nearby table about whether they use separate water to cook their GF pasta (YES!) so clearly they know what they are doing. I had their Pasta Carbonara with GF pasta and it was delicious! Flavorful and rich and everything I had hoped it would be! For dessert I had their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, which is also GF, and it was less a dessert and more a religious experience, LOL! My group didn't have to wait, but then we had stopped in and reserved a table ahead of time.

The other night I entered this fine establishment with my significant other with a large sum of money ready to treat my other to a fine dining experience, as it was our anniversary and I have had numerous good experiences here. This was a bizzare night though, I would not reccomend going on July 4th as apparently it is ""Treat a customer strangely day"" or so they would have me believe. First, as I entered the host (who was very nice mind you) asked for my number, i politely informed him i was not gay but appreciated the compliment, he got shy and handed me off to the next host, who promptly leaned over and offered to enter his coworkers number into my phone secretly without my girlfriend knowing, I again politely refused and everyone laughed lightheartedly. After we brushed that off, a waiter came running to the table and gave us a cheesecake, without ordering one and said sorry for the wait, we didn't understand but he left before we could object so we simply ate that. The new waiter came up and all but screamed at us for eating cheesecake before our appetizer, I did not understand if this was a joke or not.  Later that night, they let some people in wheelchairs sit next to us which ruined our apetites, I didn't think that was right.  Anyways, aside from the strange occurances the food was outstanding, I just don't understand why there were so many asian employees?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-richmond?start=200

Despite the large amount of people at the restaurant, we actually received our food in a timely manner. Also, our waiter was pretty hot and incredibly nice. Second, I was pleased with the food. For our appetizer, we ordered nachos and quesadillas, and we were very pleased with them. For the main dish, I ordered  the 3 cheese (Maybe 4 cheese?) pasta and it was delicious. One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had in my entire life.

We ordered a white spinach pizza and it was just so so....also the cheesecake (caramel creme brulee) was really heavy. I felt like it was all overdone and unnecessary.

It is much more vegetarian/vegan friendly.  I am so happy to see alcoholic drinks and also food that are under 550 calories.  The regular menu was always impressive but it actually wasn't that vegan friendly. Typically in the past I would get the lettuce wraps but replace the chicken with portobello slices (yummy!).  This time I got a Bloody Mary to drink (almost got a Sangria - I was torn), my step mom got a beer.  For lunch I got the grilled asparagus but skipped the aioli dip and instead got olive oil.  I also got the new mushroom lettuce wrap. My step mom got the polenta (corn cakes) and a salad.  We enjoyed everything. It was crazy crowded so we sat at the bar. The best part about the experience was not the food but the service. The bartender was this sweetheart young woman from Brazil (?) who my step mom remembered from previous dining experiences there. She was really sweet and helpful. The whole staff seemed to be very pleasant - I remember this from my other time there with my dad.  Oh Virginia I miss your southern hospitality.

Let's get to it,  the Miso salmon, tasted good and I finished it,  but shortly after eating this salmon my stomach began to hurt or feel upset, little did I know that I would become sick and had DIARRHEA the entire afternoon(we ordered food around 1:45pm), and unable to eat anything else after this yesterday, after surviving yesterday's ordeal I wrote this review.  This salmon was apparently not fresh so I would rate this dish for 1/17/2014 (Friday) as disgusting.    I have been to different cheese cake factories and find that this to be my least favorite of the ones that I have been to as apparently this is not as clean as the others (utensils and now some food). I have been to this one on a few occasions previously.  I cannot stress this enough, it is important when handling meat that all areas are clean and that the meat is not going bad.
